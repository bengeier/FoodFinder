{"text":"Perfectly situated next to Costco, you can easily grab lunch pre or post a grocery run. However, be prepared to wait. Try to go before or after the rush so you don't have to wait too long. Fortunately, the lobby is fairly large so you shouldn't need to wait outside. 

The BBQ pork (char siu) here is probably the best I've had in the city. It reminds me of the char siu you get in Hong Kong where the meat just melts in your mouth. Definitely order this. If you're short on time, get this for take out! 

The dim sum is on point. The pineapple bbq pork bun is stuffed with pork and tastes great. The food comes out fast and service is courteous and friendly. 

This place is a bit pricey, especially dinner. Nonetheless, recommended."}

Dim sum was expensive

{"text":"Wheelchair accessible, but definitely not wheelchair friendly.  

My parents went to this restaurant and advised the greeter Heidi,  which also happens to be one of the owners, that they had a party of 7 but one person is in a wheelchair.  Heidi said there was a table of 7, but it was on a upper level.  Since there was only two steps they said that they could lift the wheelchair if necessary and they would take the table.  Upon arriving at the table, a staff member let them know that an alternate table on the lower level was freeing up and if they waited there he would clean up the table and they could sit there rather than having to move my relative to the upper level.  The patrons had already paid the bill and were leaving while they patiently waited.  The tables were exactly the same size, the only difference is that the lower level table was more wheelchair accessible.  

As they were waiting, Heidi came out of nowhere and yelled at them for switching tables, even though a staff member had advised them to do so (I should point out here that the staff member apologized and said there wasn't anything he could do becuase Heidi is the owner).  I don't understand why Heidi had an issue with the table switch since they were exactly the same and they didn't do so without permission.  Anyways she said that if they wanted to take the lower level table they would have to wait in line all over again, even if they had a wheelchair.  She also said some rather offputting remarks that I will not repeat again here.  Multiple patrons of the restaurant were disgusted by her behaviour and left the restaurant.  Needless to say heated words were exchanged and at the end all she did was concede and allow them to sit at the lower level table, but that point, I can't believe she expected them to even eat there.  they did not expect special treatment for a person with a disability, nor did they expect stellar customer service.  What they did not expect is for a restaurant owner to go out of her way to make a disabled person feel unwelcome and feel like a nuisance.  This is not only an example of poor customer service but lack of empathy and compassion that is part of being a decent person.  

I would not advise anyone to give this establishment their business and I would advise the owner to take some time to reflect on their treatment of customers and other human beings.  Plthem the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE ETHICS AND CHEATERS! 

Celebrating with my extended family, 2 elders birthday. Information we provided to the manager: 
1. 2 Elders birthday 
2. Chinese birthday buns is a must
3. 13-14 guests. 
- We informed them we were not familiar with dishes so we would like their recommendation and will go with what's recommended. 

We were provided the following for $360:

1. Peking Duck - 1/4 of the plate was actually just skin and we never got remaining Peking Duck as a dish on the side. 
2. Fish stew - SO SALTY! I took one spoonful and I almost spit it back out. I had to wash it down with tea to get rid of the immense amount of salt in my mouth.
3. Crispy Chinese Roast Pork with BBQ pork - Can't go wrong with this.
4. Tofu mix with baby mussels - I didn't even bother eating this as I can make this at home anyday and it'll probably cost me less half of what they charged us. 
5. Mushroom cooked with beef bites - Nothing special and I can make it for less than half of what they charged us.
6. Cabbage wrap - Tasted good but we were only provided with 10 cabbage wraps when we had 14 guests and there were clearly more than enough fillings. Why is the restaurant cheating us on cabbages?
7. Big lobster cooked with soya sauce - Big as in 5 lbs? This is probably the most expensive dish on the menu and it was overcooked.
8. Stirred fried chinese vegetables (tong choi) with fermented tofu - Again, I can make this for less than what they charged us.
9. Chinese Birthday Buns - Tasted like every other restaurant. Nothing special.

Our family, whom were in the restaurant business clearly can tell that we got cheated for the dishes served.
1. This is a birthday celebration, why are we serving such simple dishes? If we want this we could've just stayed in and make it ourselves. 
2. Where are the rice/noodle dishes? According to the parents AND the server it's a norm to include a rice/noodle (carbs) dish for set menus. Guests can request for additional white rice if required. 
3. The portion provided were not even big enough. Everyone barely had a spoonful of each dish. 

MANAGER who recommended us this menu - We expect you to use your experience and expertise to provide us with reasonable recommendations as it is your job to ensure we enjoy our time and meal at the restaurant. CLEARLY you only care about profit and not retaining customers cause you just lost your restaurant more than a dozen potential customers. 

SERVERS - You were very attentive but clearly not enough of you as we struggle to get your attention or other tables are trying to steal your attention away from us when we were clearly talking to you.

No ethics or professionalism in customer service and dishes weren't even close to a good enough standard or portion to the amount that we paid. 

P.S. Tips weren't even included as part of the bill. We still paid 10% out of courtesy as the servers were doing their job but we honestly didn't want to pay as the manager was just a pain and didn't apologize for what happened.

NEVER RETURNING!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed about the customer service.  The server is really rude and gave customer bad attitude.  I'm really piss about the customer service and I would NOT recommend anyone come to this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!

Food ok.
Service bad.
Waiting time good."}
{"text":"You don't need to call for reservations because they don't even care. When you have reservations for 10:00 am, and you have been wait for half an hour, then you ask them how long we have to wait still, the answer for them is \" I don't know\". I WILL NEVER COME AND WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS DON'T COME THIS SHITY RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Run away from this place - Horrid customer service. 

Giving this place a one star is an insult to the rating system. it should be a Zero star.,

We have been going to this restaurant for a while (same reason why everyone raved about it - good food) but yes, bad service...however, until Dragon Legend opens in December 2013, there was not much of a choice in Richmond Hill for good dim sum.

We even had banquet dinner there and it was a decent experience until now.

In December 2013, we went for dim sum and spoke with their captain Jimmy about booking a dinner for my 96 year old mother's birthday, February 1, 2014, which happened to fall on Chinese New year weekend.  Because we had previous dinner banquet at Skyview, Jimmy assured us that we would be happy with the service, regardless of the date. 

We went there again in mid January 2014, and booked the banquet for 14 people with Jimmy. As we had a vegetarian, we wanted to make sure that all is well. Again, Jimmy assured us that we would be taken care of. We expressed that we would prefer a table in the main floor (our last banquet was held on the second level which was not easy for a 96 year old)

our reservation time was 7:00 p.m. in February 1.  it was a snowy cold Saturday. We arrived 10 minutes early and found the place was like a zoo, disorganized and full of people which we expected..We settled our 96 year old Mother and inquired about the status and was told that they were very busy and some customers were delayed. We waited patiently for an hour and finally, the hostess came by and brought us to the second level, and then the third level, which has two banquet rooms.  She told us that this was the only room available. We accepted it because it was private even though the room was a bit cold.  In this private room, there was a small sitting area above the seating area. With the 14 people and winter coats, we thought that it would be a good compromise birthday presents , we put our coats, birthday presents in the sitting area.  

We waited for another 20 minutes to get service aka tea. Just when our first course was arriving, Jimmy showed up and asked us to move to another space because the hostess made a mistake, the room was reserved for someone else.  We were shocked but because we did not want to make a scene during Chinese New Year, we moved to the table across the hall... Then we realized that the table was set for 10 people and the waitress said that it was only for 10.  Finally we decided to move another smaller table to join our table to make it 14 seat.  The waitress came by and told us that it was not possible because she had to serve the other table. By then, it was 9:30 p.m. and we informed her to walk around us. 

By 10:45 p.m. , we had our dinner and yes we even tipped the full amount (the servers would suffer if we did not tip). Jimmy never gave us a discount or even came by to see if we were okay. 

 Skyview is not worthy of anyone's  business.  they may have decent food, but their service is beyond poor. The previous comments about giving their tables away are all true - if you book tables, why would you have a one hour delay unless you give your table away to your 'preferred' customers.  

If my 96 year old mom was not there, we would have gone across the street to Dragon Legend, they have great food, great service. 

Customers: if you truly want good Chinese dimsum, and great service, don't come here.  They lie to you, they will give away your table for their \"preferred\" customers (there are rankings too).  

Run away from here and choose somewhere else...Crown Prince on Victoria Park or even Jim Chai Kee on Highway 7 will be better.

{"text":"Dim sum are good but I am not impressed about the wait. Price is reasonable, which is at the same level as most of the Chinese restaurant. Their signature dish is the BBQ pork. Lots of people having it there. 

I love their fried rice noodles dish as well.

Decoration is not as fancy as other Chinese restaurant and therefore I won't recommend to host any special events there. It is ok to have gathering in evening but make sure to have reservation beforehand."}
{"text":"Worse dining experience ever. The food is not worth the frustrating and rude service. There are so many other options in the area.. save yourself and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my mom's birthday with a bunch of family friends. We had fantastic customer service throughout the meal. The food was absolutely amazing. We had about 10 different dishes. They arrived quickly and they changed our plates a few times which was great. 

They brought out the birthday cake and even sang \"happy birthday\". 

Would totally come back here for more food!"}
{"text":"Went for Dim Sum.  Food was good, fresh, service a little slow, but I would add it to my Dim Sum rotation.  Thumbs up"}
{"text":"This rating is based on their service and not necessarily their food. 

I've been here twice and though their dim sum isn't bad and their BBQ pork is pretty good, the wait times for a table are ridiculous.  The first time, I waited for 2 hours! Why didn't I just leave? I wish I could but we were waiting in line because my mother in law wanted to eat here.  So no can do, 2 hour wait it was.  The second time, we just left after an hour and realized we were getting no where.  Here's the reason why the wait is so long.  Because they take reservations/ have a VIP list.  The hostess will give you a number as in all Chinese restaurants and have you wait until the number is called.  But it takes such a long time for them to call your number because they're calling people from the VIP list first.  So unfortunately, no matter how early you get there, you can't beat the VIP list.  

Unless you're on the VIP list, you're better off eating at one of the other multiple  restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"Tried both dim sum and dinner -- awful restaurant, will never go back again! Despite of the pricey food and not too many selections on the menu, their service is the worst ever seen in Toronto. 

Before starting the meal, their dirty dining ware has already ruined my appetite. You can see the food from previous customers left on the bowl and the wet napkin, ugh!
The average wait time of each dish is about 15 minutes and up, some are even longer, you have to remind them several times before they bring your dishes
The food is actually ok, all typical dim sum or dinner dishes that you can get anywhere in Toronto, no surprise at all and not very big portion
Their waiters/waitresses are not very polite, the manager is even terribly rude, very impatient to answer your questions. He came and checked the table couple times during our dining, one is to see whether you are ready to get out and the other is to bring you the bill, we had to wait another 20 minutes to finish check out

If you look the price that you pay for their food and services, it is absolute not worth to try"}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible.   We made reservations and realized it doesn't help.   If you know the hostess/people there, you get seated right away.    They were rude and didn't think twice about their responses and tone when you ask about your seating.  We waited a long while and in the end our large party had to split tables and not even close tables to be \"semi-together\".  Their attitude was take it or leave it.. even though we made reservations.  The food was not bad but service is important to me.  Even if the food is fit for the emperor, if they treat their customers poorly, it's a big turn off."}
{"text":"Reservation = walk in.  Pointless to make reservations.  We made a reservation the day before for 11:00am the next day morning. When we arrived we are not being served but was asked to wait.  This is  pointless for reservation, as at the same time they still take walk in and people who has reservation is under the same queue with the walk in.  After 30min, we asked how much longer will be the wait? The lady answered \"no idea, I don't know\". Avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the same location as Café Cogo.  Surprise to see the always busy Cafe Cogo has gone so quickly.  You can see some of the managers and waitress/waiter there are from the same organization.  But this restaurant is by itself.  It has no link to the former Café Cogo or the Dragon Boat chain.

The wait is really long.  We are told to wait for 15 minutes but at the end more than 45 minutes.  At last we have a seat.  We have prepared ourselves for the hungry stomach by filling in the Dim Sum sheet while in line.  Once sitting down, the sheet is submitted.  When the tea arrives, an extra pot of hot water is accompanied.  It is a advisable move given the busy lunch hour.  You can help yourself if the pot of tea is going to be empty.

By speedy submission of order, we have the first Dim Sum arrives within 5 minutes.  It is being consumed so quickly as if it has evaporated.  Other Dim Sum arrives one after another.

All Dim Sum is delivered by hand.  The delivery Dim Sum waitress has a plate full of Dim Sum.  The plate can has a maximum of 3 piles.  So if the Dim Sum is delivered to more than 3 tables, there will be more than 1 clip per pile.  The lady has to sort out which one belongs to each table.  So I can see how slow she is while moving from one table to another.  Maybe the management can think of an easy way out.

The service and food is very good.  The décor is largely same as Café Cogo.  There are not many partitions at the entrance resulting in cold air for the nearby 10 tables.  You can also enjoy one of the specialty Dim Sum dish only used to be available at Dragon Boat here in this restaurant - the chicken pie with crispy top."}
{"text":"The hostess sat us 3min pass 11am on purpose after waiting for almost an hour, so they can charge us more for the same menu with higher prices they charge after 11am.  Had to ask for tea and water 3 times and wait half an hour to get them. Then a server poured hot water into an already full tea pot for no reason and then tried to pour out overflowing hot water into my 5 year old daughter's cup and spilled whole lot of hot water in front of my young child. Of course there was no apology. Ended up with $75 bill when it should be $40. Total rip off and the worst service ever."}

But here, they have the yellow yolk buns that I wanted, they're not exactly what I'm looking for but pretty close. Also their bbq pork are soooo delicious as well. I have to say this cruisine is probably the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Don't go if you're not going with someone that is a frequent customer or else you'll never get a table.

Food was decent. Good variety and pretty fresh. Our first dish came with a strand of long curly black hair. 

Service was horrendous. We had to ask each time for our empty plates to be removed and tea to be refilled. These are very basic things for a Chinese dim sum restaurant. Lucky for us, the server assigned to our area was extremely unfriendly. 

Will never go again. Why pay for such bad service??"}

baked bbq pork bun(order before they run out)
Siu Mai
Beef noodle with bitter melon"}

Food: 8/10

For dim sum only! 

This is my go to spot for dim sum in Markham. The decor and cleanliness of the place is above average, by Chinese standards, and the food is really quite good. Classic dishes come out piping hot and full of flavour.

The only downside is they always seem to be understaffed. Food can take a little bit, and unless you're okay with waking up fairly early, you will have to wait for a table as well.

THE BOTTOM LINE: the wait for a table and food may be a bit longer, but the food is good!"}
{"text":"The BBQ pork (cha siu) here is AMAZING!!! Probably the best in Canada!! It's a must try if you're ever in the area. 

This place is always packed for dim sum! Lots of choices and decent prices as well. The dim sum here is just average. The rice rolls are a little too thick and not smooth enough. Everything else is fine, but tastes just like every other dim sum restaurant. 

Would recommend here for BBQ pork."}
{"text":"Good was great! It was very clean and the staff were decent especially for a dim sum place. Would come back for sure !"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place for my \"affordable\" high end chinese food.  I really don't see the fusion in their food at all, it's just very well done and tasty cantonese cooking.  Their roast suckling pork one of the best in the city, they remove the extra fat layer under the skin and place it back on the flavourful meat, smoky goodness.  Peking duck is also one of the best, with their well done skin wrappers and lovely dipping sauce.  Great service, but kitchen can be a bit slow at times."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with some family members. There is plenty of parking on site. We ordered the set banquet for 6 for $148 and added an extra beef stir fried noodle. With taxes and 15% service charge the bill came to $215/-. We had soup, vegetables & fish maw, chicken, 3 lb lobster, steamed fish, pork ribs and fried rice. The food was good and the service excellent. Portions were of a decent size."}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum #?? on a Sat morning after being on vacation in Europe, so we we're definitely craving some good Chinese food. We had a reservation for 12pm but we still waited 45min to get seated because there was already a crowd of people still waiting for a table. I think it just has to be managed better, like have an app that customers can bid for tables or have organized seating times. I saw some people leave in frustration (i.e. banging the sh*t out of the handicap button to open the door); and while it's understandable to react like that when you're hungry, it's certainly not very mature and respectful behavior. Nevertheless, I guess you just have be patient if you want to eat their food..

I think what business owners should realize is that if you have a less hectic environment in the front of the house, your customers will probably be more polite to the servers.

The food, I thought was really good, and again if you're patient enough to wait for your table, you get to order their BBQ pork. Tea wasn't that great, I mean it's called #?? for a reason, so it gets -1 star, but the food is consistent. We just ordered alot of random things (that guy sold us on so many extra dishes), that by the end, everything gets cold and gummy, and lunch turns into the \"who ordered this on the sheet?!\" game. Nevertheless, it was fun to drink tea and catch up with your friends.

Anyways, the moral of this story is: be patient at the door, try and book your lunches during off peak hours (either 30min after opening or 3pm), be kind to your servers/compliment them once in a while, and  you'll have a better experience.. not like all the 1star reviews that you read on this.

P.S. try not to drool on your cellphone screen."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean and comfortable place to eat, beautiful interior design, decent amount of parking, food was fresh and delicious for dim sum. 

Have yet to try dinner, perhaps will give it a try one day.

The only thing I noticed is the hostess is never always at the front to lead you to a table. You'd have to walk further in to be noticed. No one else in the team will give you a table other than the hostess."}

This place has a few special dim sum options such as the pineapple bun with Cha Shu filling (I believe call the #1 bun). Also go for the pan fried spare ribs with honey and lemon. 

P.s. don't come during lunch on Saturday. The wait will be long and cold"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nicely decorated after it was bought by Dragon Boat Fusion and had a wide selection of food. It's a nice place to have a family gathering or a large group gathering. Came here for a family dinner. Ordered a few dishes. 

Barbecue pork looked very good. They looked shiny in appearance and the sauce made the pork sweet. I found the meat tender and soft, which the texture was a bit different from the texture I used to have (chewy and slice slightly hard).

Peking duck, the skin was crispy. As seen in the picture, it came with many side dishes. The side dishes ranged from the traditional green onion to the trendy cotton candies. Other than eating the Peking duck with wraps, there's another other dishes that made out of the Peking duck was wrapping with lettuce. This is one of my childhood favourite dishes.

We did other dishes as well but didn't have a chance to take pictures. They were too attractive to eat right away. The dishes in this restaurant were excellent and would go again to try out their dim sum."}
{"text":"If you want bad service and good food, come to Skyview! Their service is horrible, but their food is delicious. In the past two times I have gone to Skyview, it has taken our food 30-40 minutes to arrive. The waiters/hosts/hostesses forgot about us and they didn't even try and serve us. The workers who sent out the food were such more helpful than the hosts/hostesses. Their dim sum is very good and reasonably priced. Their shrimp dumplings (har gow), sticky rice in the bamboo leaves, siu mai, deep fried pork dumpling and egg tarts are delicious! Stay away from their tripe. It doesn't have that much flavour. Expect a long wait on weekends if you go around the weekend. If you order before 11:30am you get any size of the dishes for $3.95."}
{"text":"It is not often enough that I venture north of the bloor but when i do i like to make the most of it.

This weekend was my usual craving dimsum and soon enough I found myself up here in Markham at Skyview. 

I am glad I took my friend's advice to get there before 11am as at this time things really got busy and waiting times increased. We were seated in 10 minutes after arriving at 10.30am. 

The place is huge, and not a plastic table cloth to be seen anywhere.

The four of us gorged on a feast of dimsummy stuff, and it was really good but not amazing enough for me to want to come here regularly.

The service was good, after placing the initial order it did take about another 10 minutes for the food to come out which for me seemed a bit slow, or that could be expected since the place was full."}
{"text":"Part of the reason why I love my intern is we have very different food cravings at different times. On this particular day, I was unsure what I was craving but she had a Dim Sum craving that would rival that of pregnant women who crave Pickles and Ice cream. I was scared (a little) so I complied and we found ourselves at Skyview Fusion.

Now as my intern informed me, there is nothing 'Fusion' about this place, it's a Dim Sum joint and a higher end one at that. Apparently fusion is one of those overused terms among Asian restaurants to make themselves sound more diverse. I learn something new everyday - so reader beware of future fusion spots.

I'll get the negatives out of the way first: Pretty pricy Dim Sum ($44 + tip) for two people AND, as many have already said, service was pretty shotty - even though the place wasn't too busy.

That said, food is fantastic, standouts were the Sui Mai, Har Gow, the BBQ pork pun, Soup dumplings, OH OH and the steamed bun with sweetened egg yolk in the center (definitely an artery clogger)... actually to be fair pretty much everything (even the tripe) was excellent.

Bathrooms were modern and extremely clean, and IF price is a concern, don't avoid this place as the daily early bird special runs from 9am-11am - however you must submit order sheet before 10:50am.

Eatcrest Out!"}

It's all the same - the square wooden baskets, the huge Har Gow with the prawn and the huge Shiu Mai along with creative offerings. They have it all in a bright space with many fish tanks.

{"text":"I had not come back to this restaurant for while! Forget what reason! :)

Until yesterday! 
Friend told me , she want to try the BBQ Roasted Pork ( Cha Shiu in Chinese). She said everyone go there for that ! 

We went for morning dim sum around 10am in the morning! there were many tables available. but the server gave us the table for 2 just right behind the entrance. Compared to others Chinese restaurant, they would give any table available even bigger but won't close to toilet or entrance! Well that's their organized then we took it.

We tried the dim sum. Those are average that compared with others dim sum restaurant. We ordered Roasted Pork rice after 11am ( caused the chef start to work at 11am, It mean the roasted pork is not fresh made. the waitress told us. the roasted pork was made the night before. ) The first bite seems ok. because that was hot & look fresh with fatty part of pork ! 

The roasted pork actually is not that excellent as those comment ! Possibly the gimmick of the restaurant. Or you may say, the food is not good but only the others restaurant made worse. 

If you are not gimmick followers. I suggest that some food court, take away or supermarket may have some good bbq pork that may surprise you though!"}
{"text":"A regular dim sum place for me and my family, conveniently located beside Costco and First Markham Place for some weekend shopping and errand running. The place is decently sized and after their renovations a few years ago the layout is open concept and traditional Chinese restaurant style. Bringing someone that knows the place well will help speed up getting a table - always a thing at Chinese restaurants. In fact - knowing a manager could get you 10% off and a reduction on your per-head base fee (a few dollars only, covers the tea). The wait for a table on the weekend can be lengthy especially for walk-ins. If you make a reservation be sure to arrive early otherwise run the risk of having to wait - your table is given away quickly for no-shows. Best advice: come early (11:30am for lunch is ideal) and don't bring too many friends (4-6 people).

The selection of dim sum is pretty good here, a good mix of traditional items and some unique plates. Be wary that the dim sum are assigned a \"size\" which determines their price, and some can rack up to almost $10 a dish. A number of specials are offered by waiters coming by with a tray - typically these are on the expensive end of the spectrum but worth it for their rarity in the dim sum market (compared to other nearby dim sum locations), freshness, and portion size. Difficult to say what my favorites are, my usual tactic is to observe other tables to see what looks good and ask what it is. Quality of each dish is contingent on the ingredients (i.e. whatever is on the market) so be understanding when some items are sub-par.

Food is typically quick to arrive, though flagging a server down may be a challenge. Be assertive but give patience.

In the past I've been here for dinner and their dishes are pretty good. It can get expensive and they will promote more expensive items like seafood, so if you're looking for some casual Chinese food without the the frills of better service, consider places with \"Congee\" in the name...if you're looking for a slower paced, quiet dinner with seafood and the like, then this is a good choice.

All this said - come here for some dim sum if that's what you're looking for. In terms of looking for good food that keeps you coming back...I'd venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"Initially, I really wanted to 2/3 star this, because I got a dirty dish and that is by far THEE biggest pet peeve I've ever had. However, the experience I had with the food was reaaally good, so I shall unhappily give this restaurant 4 stars. I saw one of the owners of dragon boat there so I'm guessing this is an affiliate restaurant. And just like dragon boat, the prices here are higher than typical dim sum places. Some of the food items that stuck out to me were the egg tarts (crust is diff from typical ones! try and you shall understand), chicken pie tart, the bbq pork rice roll, and the fried taro bun thingy (don't remember exact name...). The other items like the chicken feet were pretty standard; good sauce though, didn't mess it up like other dim sum places often do.  Also for those who love tea (ME!), they actually serve really good quality tea here too. Pretty rare at Chinese restaurants, I think the only other resto with good quality tea is Graceful Vegetarian. The tea I ordered was the Iron Guan Yin if anyone is interested. I also intend on coming back for the BBQ pork, cause apparently they've advertised about that, and the BBQ pork in the rice roll was VERY good (hope they keep it up by the time I return!)

There may be some management kinks they still need to work out though. There seems to be a plethora of large tables and a scarcity of small ones. My family of three had to take up a table meant for around 8 ppl, which felt kind of awkward. Overall though, this was a great dim sum restaurant, but I guess if I count in the dirty dish, the price and the seating issues I think I realistically have to give this a 3.5. If these problems are fixed and they maintain their food quality I can see this place being a 4 or even a 5!"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible!! The staff is super rude and will ignore you if you try to ask for anything. The food is mediocre at most. I am a visitor from Chicago and I wish they will travel to Chicago's Tang Restaurant and witness what great service is from Long Ge. Will never come back!"}
{"text":"Service:
Better than most Asian dim sum places, they are somewhat polite. The place is actually quite big, but parking is horrible. I know some of you do it, raise your hand, you park at Costco then walk over! It's okay, Costco's parking lot is just as bad, if not worse lols.

Food:
I actually find the prices a little high for this restaurant, around $4-6 per dish (depending on the size). For those of you who don't do dim sum, please note that dishes are priced by size.  Ages ago, all the dishes were probably below $4 but with inflation and what not, it's ridiculous now. In Hong Kong, everything was cheap, like what the hell. Anyways, most of the dishes were decent but nothing blew me away. For the 4 of us, we paid around $60 which is not too bad but we aren't big eaters. With dim sum, you really should watch your calories because everything there is oiled up. I actually enjoyed the deep fried squid tentacles because it was so crispy, that's like my thing."}
{"text":"What's the point of reservations if you don't honour it. 3 tables came after us without reservations and got seated before us. Very poor customer service! Not recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Although a bit on the expensive side, SKYVIEW FUSION CUISINE offered some of the best (if not the best) dim sum I've had outside of Hong Kong and LA. Not only were the dishes fresh and steaming, but they were tasty, hearty, and beautiful to look at!

HIGHLIGHTS:

- The BBQ pork pineapple bun is excellent! I had 4 of them myself. Delicious with a great blend of syrup and meat inside the bun. The BBQ pork tastes like BBQ pork and the entire bun in itself is a total winner. Highly recommended!

- The BBQ pork rice dish is also incredible. The BBQ pork itself is one of the best I've had ever.  It's meaty and comes in a legitimate size, unlike other places that give you very slim, not fresh, and hard pieces. The taste itself is tender and great. 

- The egg yolk bun is a great delight to cap off the meal. Get it while it's fresh so the yolk inside oozes as you break the steamed bun open. It's soft, juicy, sweet, and just plain amazing! The best I've had on the eastern coast of North America for sure. 

Overall, SKYVIEW was a pleasant surprise and an amazing discovery. I consider myself an avid lover of all things buns and dim sum, and in this restaurant, I have found a go-to dim sum place for future visits. Good stuff!"}

{"text":"I have been to this restaurants a few times over the past two years. They just changed ownership lately. While there are some upgrades done such as the interior and a nicer dim sum menu sheet, the food quality is not as good as before. All of our food came in too salty. Looks like they still have to work on the new kitchen crew. Presentation of the food is great and service is attentive. I hope they will improve on the next time I visit"}

{"text":"My mom was craving early morning yum cha so I pulled my ass out of bed today on a Saturday morning to fulfil her request. 

We were very disappointed to find out that this place doesn't offer early morning discounted prices on weekends. Pretty expensive without it in my opinion. But I guess you get what you pay for.. the atmosphere is very comfortable and clean. The food didn't take too long to arrive and was relatively hot (except the running egg yolk bun which had unfortunately already started to coagulate).

The only off-putting thing here that's worth mentioning is the music choice. As we were seated at around 9:30am, they turned on the speakers and it was straight up 99.9 Virgin Radio. So although I had an enjoyable time jamming to some Tay Tay, Ed Sheeran, and Meghan Trainor as I nibbled my egg yolk bun, I have a feeling the other 60yrs old+ Chinese people here didn't."}
{"text":"Located next to the Costco near Woodbine & Hwy 7.  Looks like lots of people go for dim sum and grocery shopping without having to move the car.  However, unless you take advantage of their early bird pricing (we did not), not that great a place for dim sum...better quality/price choices are readily available.  Our party of four paid $57 all in for 8 so-so dim sum dishes plus a noodle plate."}
{"text":"Restaurant has been here for awhile but recently changed owners and did renos. Came here for cny dinner with a big group. Service was good. Food was decent but have had better. Nice new modern decor w/ bright lights. Situated right beside Costco!"}
{"text":"Can make reservations for dim sum - even with a reservation be prepared to wait a bit. We waited about 10 minutes.

The bbq pork pineapple buns here are really good. Also the beef balls, tripe, shrimp balls with almond slices, singapore fried noodles, winter melon, and bbq pork plate. All awesome.

Dishes that I didn't stand out for me: Rice rolls, veggie dumpling, sui mai, baked bbq pork puff pastry

Large dim sum portions. So filling!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the dim sum here. Even though we come here a lot, there is one complaint that I have with this place. 

Reservations here mean nothing. You can be booked for 1:00, but when you arrive, you can still be waiting for 30 min to 1 hour depending on the speed at which people eat. IT REALLY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF A RESERVATION. This is exactly what happened to us the last time. 

Overall, I can say that the food is worth the wait. The food is fresh and tasty. Portions are standard, so you may want to order more for larger parties. 

Atmosphere wise, it isn't too loud, but it isn't quiet either. I know that this review is kinda short, but there really is nothing to say except that the food is good, but the service with reservations suck."}
{"text":"Their cha Siu (bbq pork) is really good! Their other dishes are all decent as well. However their service is very bad (3 requests and 20mins for rice, 2 requests and 15mins for soy sauce) and it gets very loud when it's full house. If you want a better experience, come on a week day! Also, the staff doesn't speak much English."}
{"text":"Love their Cha Siew plate!! The pork Cha Siew served with cold beans was divine. Friends from Hong Kong said that this is exactly how it's served in Hong Kong. All their dim sum dishes with shrimp came with generous amount of shrimp.

I don't know why this place got such low Yelp ratings but it's surprisingly good. They also have servers walking around with ad hoc dim sum trays which usually happens at authentic dim sum places. The only thing I didn't like was that the spare ribs were on the salty side. Other than that, this place is a solid four-star."}
{"text":"When the server constantly gave out tables to their preferred/regular customers in front of you, this restaurant deserves no star regardless how good their food is. We waited for our table for 1.5 hours when you were the next 2 on the list. No. I'm not coming back at all. The end."}
{"text":"Came here for my Aunt's 30th Wedding anniversary and there was about 6 tables of 10. We got here right at 6:30 and we didn't start eating till 7:30. Each of the dishes came out in 15 minute intervals and we were clearing the plates fast in 5 minutes because we were so hungry! The service was extremely slow for a Chinese restaurant and on top of that the food wasn't even that good for the wait time. Most of the dishes tasted bland and the portion sizes were pretty small. I think the only dish that tasted good was the lobster. I was planning to come here for dim sum on another occasion but I think I changed my mind as the food prolly tastes the same and hearing that it's overpriced, I don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots for Chinese food in the GTA. They're more of a fusion, traditional food with a twist. BBQ anything is really good here. 

Had the wasabi shrimp this time round which was ok. Not a favourite of mine but I don't mind trying new stuff. 

Always come back when I crave Chinese food."}
{"text":"Only been here for dim sum. Same ownership group that opened up dragon boat fusion cuisine on east beaver creek. Very good dim sum but quite pricy.  The char siu fahn (bbq pork with rice) is fantastic. Also the portuguese chicken tarts are amazing as well.

The standard fare (siu mai, hah gao, etc) are all good. Wrapping on the shrimp dumpling (hah gao) couldve been thinner.

Not sure if I'd be back for dinner cuz the place is known for its dim sum. Dragon Boat Fusion has insane food for dinner though. So if that's an indication of the dinner menu then I might be inclined."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, the food is good for the price of $2.80. Good chefs but TERRIBLE management/owners. We ordered 15 dishes and only 14 came. As an owner, you should give your customer the benefit of the doubt, and charge for only 14 dishes. The owner yelled at us telling everyone in line to pay that we were refusing to pay! You know when you go to a dim sum place, every time an order comes to your table they mark it off on your sheet. There were 14 dishes marked off. This owner is just ridiculous - she said she didn't know and just told us to pay. Sure, it's only $2.80 but what does this tell you about the business?"}
{"text":"The best roast pork (and believe me I am a Cantonese and I've tried countless reataurant's roast pork in GuangZhou, Hong Kong, Canada and US) ever!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this has to be one of the best Chinese restaurants I have eaten at for a long time. The service was very good, the waiters and the manager treated us very well. Their dinner sets are to die for, it is worth every penny for any set. My family had ordered the $88 Set Meal for 6 people and I was never disappointed with one bit of the meal. It all started with a nice piping hot bowl of their daily soup, and honestly it was amazing, they even separated the soup meat and the vegetables onto a separate plate. Then, came the amazing dishes. It started with the Bok Choy with Mushrooms in a Chicken Broth, which was amazing after each bite. Then, came the Fried Spare Ribs in Red Bean Curd Sauce, and honestly it was one of the best dishes I ever had. Next, came Fired Shrimp in Maggi Sauce, which in my mind, was simply immaculate. The Long Range Chicken with Compoy was prepared to excellence. Finally, their Steamed Fish was simply amazing with the right balance between the bass and soy sauce.  After around 20 minutes or so, the waiters would walk by, and help change plates with all your bones and such for a new plate which was very pleasing. So, if you are ever in the Markham area, my suggestion would be to come down to Skyview Fusion Cuisine and have taste of a world of heaven in the world of Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Good food, prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are exactly what you'd expect from a chinese restaurant.  I came here for dim sum and was very happy with the food.  The service is ok, not the best, not the worst.  I was taking my folks out and wanted to pay so went to the cashier to pay but they had to grab the order sheet from the table.  Then I had to stand in a specific place to pay for the bill.  Literally the guy told me to take 3 steps to the left and 1 back.  And had me wait there.  It was really weird.  But besides that the food is really good.  Their bbq pork is probably the best in the city (bold words).  But its really moist, soft, and the glaze is done really really well.  its been 2 days and the leftovers still taste good.  Another thing to try is the bbq pork pinapple buns.  Something unique and becoming more popular in Canada, but so far the only place I've found in Markham."}
{"text":"Trash. Made a reservation and still have to wait an hour to be seated. Not worth the time or money. Could have ordered and finished a meal in the time it took to seat us. Half our party was starving or sleeping by the time our food came around."}
{"text":"I'm now convinced - this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Toronto area.  Not sure of the 'Fusion' label, which sometimes raises a red flag for me - they are every bit authentic Chinese as any establishments I can think of, the butternut squash soup we had tonight notwithstanding. My wife's sister and family played host to the pre-wedding bridal families, and we were blessed to be included. The Peking duck was tasty to the bone. Other acclaimed 'best dishes' include A) The dry-roasted free range chicken, crispy and flavorful; B) tenderloin cubes, made fresh and served fancy in a nest of vermicelli - we're talking real filet mignon cut and not tenderized round or other ersatz cuts, enhanced by a great mix of baby king mushrooms and bacon bits.  How can you miss? C) grouper belly in a delicious melange of baby snow pea shoots, lightly fried bean curd balls, mushrooms - my personal favorite.  But there was one false note: the steamed lobster with vermicelli, magnificently presented (I took a picture, but lost it) did not taste nearly as good as it looked.  The lobster was perfectly just-cooked (meaning not over - VERY tricky to do), but it was totally overwhelmed by the chopped garlic the smothered every piece.  When you steam a lobster, you want to be able to taste the natural beauty of it sweet succulent meat, but how can you do that when you can ward off vampires from 100 steps?  What a waste and missed opportunity!  But I shall overlook that.  The crowd waiting to be seated tells me that I'm not the only fan. This may be my go-to place when we're here when money's no object.  Remember the special soup I yelped about in the first review?  The most expensive one is $198, but since it serves 10, it's just a wee bit more than what a great lobster bisque would be in a pricey french restaurant, right?"}
{"text":"First time back since this place being replace on many time. The food isn't too bad. The bbq pork is good if they put little less honey. The dim sum is good but it has such a small variety. There is no afternoon specials either. The service was pretty good. I don't think I will come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. Reservation made for 8:00, was not seated until 8:45. 

We would've waited for the same amount of time if we didn't have a reservation. And we came in a group of ten. It felt pretty uncomfortable standing in a group of ten in other people's way for 45 mins. 

They did not seem concerned by our wait. I mentioned it's been a while since we've been waiting. To only get a response 'it's busy'. 

The food was actually pretty decent. Service was okay once we were seated. 

I would come back on a weekday night to try it out again. Hopefully they'll change their attitude towards reservations by then."}
{"text":"I think Skyview is one of the top dimsum spots in Markham and shouldn't be overlooked! The decor is modern and pretty and the service was okay. The food was great! We came around 12PM, right at the end of their early bird special. The wait was not too bad, but I'm sure we got lucky. 

The Har Gau is delicious and the wrapper was so thin, smooth, and silky! Their rice rolls are the same type of texture - We had the beef, shrimp, and the vegetarian option (parsley).  Among the things we also ordered: Egg tarts, Phoenix Claws, Thousand Year Egg & pork congee, Fu Pei Guen (tofu skin wrap filled with mushroom & veggies)

The hardest part is waiting for everything to come out! They don't come out all at once, so once one dish is devoured, you will be sitting there just waiting on a new one."}
{"text":"Quite simply some of the most amazing food I've had. The chicken was perfectly textured, a nice mix of gelatinous and tender meat, even the chicken breast meat. The soup was super cool, with a mix of seafood, tofu, fish maw. The greens were ever so tender, some of which were topped with tofu skin, homemade apparently. The lobster was stir-fried and flavored with some sort of curry flavor. There was also a fish dish on top of spinach, lightly fried but not too too doughy."}
{"text":"Skyview is a bit pricier than other dim sum restaurants in the Markham and neighborhood but I was impressed by the quality of the dim sum dishes and the little things that left me feeling with a positive experience.

Me and my YEA came here for some mid-afternoon dim-sum (they stop serving at 3PM during the week) and had a feast unto ourselves.

The room is bright and bustling like a any good dim sum restaurant should be and the table dishware and flatware were also spot on.  I really like that they offered a larger teacup (with a handle!) instead of the normal small dim sum teacup.  Nothing wrong with being modern in that respect.

Here are the things that warmed my heart to Skyview Fusion and why I don't mind paying for the slightly above average pricing:

1. The har gow came 4 per order and were stuffed with shrimp.  Har gow are normally one bit items but this had so much large chunks of shrimp that it required two.

2. The sui mai had a whole shrimp placed on top and other places you may just find a few sprinkles of fish roe.

3. The sweet pineapple crusted BBQ buns are an absolute treat here!  The bun and the sweet crust on top is firm and crunchy whilst the bbq pork inside is savoury and juicy.  Excellent combination.

4. I really enjoyed the beef cheung phun (rice noodle roll) here. It seemed like a generous portion of beef wrapped in the delicate white rice noodle roll.

5. Other dim sum items that I expected to get may 3 items in the dish turned out to be four like the steamed beef balls, the pineapple crusted bbq pork buns, and the har gow.

6. The service was quick and there was enough wait staff around to help refill tea, hot water, or get additional dipping sauces.  Am I the only one that loves the horseradish-y mustard they serve at these places? Where can I find it?!

I'm starting to become a fan of this place and would definitely come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"It's with mixed feelings I give this restaurant a bad rating. I have had dim sum here multiple times that were great but a dinner experience yesterday which was horrible. 

I'll start with Dim Sum, typically the wait for 2 is short even on a busy weekend. Dim sum comes out quite quick and fresh, similar to Dragon Boat. Skyview is my go to dim sum now since I can get to it quickly off 404 and I can go to costco right after. 

Now on to my dinner experience. It was a Tuesday and I had a feeling they were understaffed in the kitchen because we waited 1 hour for our food. The first time we let the manager know it has been a long time, he just said \"yea it takes a long time\", we reiterated to go please check, which he said he would but he never came back to update us. At least 4-5 times we asked them to check and they said they would but never let us know whats happening. As well 30 minutes after our order they let us know they were out of an eggplant dish, at that point we weren't even sure if to order more or not cause the original dishes didn't even make it out yet. 

In short, I would still recommend this restaurant for dim sum but avoid at all costs for dinner on weekdays."}
{"text":"Both the decor and service is excellent !   We have been here many times for dim sum which is quite good but this is the dinner review.   

The Peking duck is very good and for another $8.80 you get a second dish of lettuce with the duck.   

Unfortunately the rest of the dishes did not live up to the duck!   The vegetables was over cooked, the fish was tasteless, the ribs had too much fat on it and the chicken was kind of weird tasting (almost sweet).

If not for the service, environment and duck, I probably would have given them a two star rating.  Such a shame too since their dinner used to be quite good.   Hopefully they sort out the kitchen!"}
{"text":"\"Meh, I've experienced better\" is right, Yelp. I almost feel bad weighing this rating more based on service than food, but at the price of dimsum, I truly expected better. 

This is considered a higher end dim sum place. They call themselves fusion but don't expect an east meets west type of deal. It's just slight modifications to their dimsum, like ribs in rice rolls. 

The way this restaurant is run really makes me upset. We wanted to flag down a staff member (and we know to flag down the ones with blazers because the vested staff were lower ranked so they don't deal with bills) and he tells us to wait while he gets someone for us. Then he stands there to look at the dining area and doesn't actually do anything. A vested staff member comes and asks what we wanted, and it's all OK. 

When you go in, the hostess is rarely there. And I don't think it's really her fault but the upper management has designated only ONE hostess, and she has to circulate around to find empty tables for the guests. Why they don't invest in an earpiece or walkie talkie system is beyond me. There's a huge backlog of guests and it isn't because this place is particularly good. 

Personally, I thought the dimsum was eh. Flavours didn't really stand out to me, and their Yeung Chow fried rice was SUPER oily. If you're looking to get a zit, then get their fried rice/noodle dishes. 

The food quality (and service quality) definitely do not match up to the price they are demanding. If I'm paying $4-$6 per dimsum, I expect better manners. Moreover, this place is severely understaffed, even on the weekdays! Admin needs to hire more people and adopt an earpiece system because when you have only 1 hostess and she has to circulate to find empty tables, you're going to get a clogged entrance.

Finally, I really, really, really despise that there's a VIP system here. I don't mean the 10% discount, I mean that if you know the staff personally, you can literally skip the line, walk into the dining area, and demand for a table. And they WILL give you a table. So if you need to wait 8 tables before you're called, guess what! These people can just walk in and not wait in line because they're holier-than-thou. 

I understand that this treatment is tolerated in several places, but I honestly thought that the service and guests would be of a higher calibre here since the price range is so much higher than other dimsum places."}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum with some friends, and had a great time. Since our friend said that this place gets busy early, we arrived at 10am, and had no problem getting a table. The restaurant itself has a nice water treatment upon the entering, and the space is modern and minimal in burgundy and yellow decor elements. Tables are laid out well, and there is plenty of space to bring your kids and still maintain a good level of privacy.

They don't do carts here, and we like that. That means everything arrives piping hot. Between the 5 of us, we ordered 7 different things, in quantities of 2, and 3 desserts. Xia Jiao (shrimp dumplings), Shao Mai (pork shrimp steamed dumplings), No Mi Ji (deep fried glutinous rice with chicken), Luo buo Gao (pan fried radish cake), Niu Rou Qiu (beef balls with bean curd skin), Xia Chang Fen (shrimp filled rice noodle roll), Niu Bai Ye (Steamed beef tripe with green onions), Dan Ta (Egg custard tarts), Dou Fu Hua (steamed sweet tofu soup), and Ma La Gao (sweet yellow sponge cake). We paired it with Pu-Er Tea.

For the most part, each item was good, but our favorites were the pork shrimp steamed dumplings, pan fried radish cake, shrimp filled rice noodle, beef tripe, and sponge cake. The steamed shrimp dumplings had a great skin, but the filling wasn't the right texture. Instead of mincing the shrimp meat into a nice paste with a few small pieces of whole shrimp, it was ALL whole shrimp. The flavor was spot on, but it would have had a sweeter flavor had the meat been minced a little.

Other than that, we were pretty satisfied, and of course, great company makes it all the better. Final bill ended up being $74 CAD before tip, and for 5 people, it was a good price. You can't beat the freshness, and we'd gladly return. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and can say this is a solid place. Good Friday was the day we'd arranged for a double date early breakfast. We arrived around 9 and there were already a few groups waiting. Tables were full and we were the second group to take a number. Y'all don't enjoy sleeping in, eh? 

After waiting for the first round of diners at 8:30 to finish eating, we were seated around 10 and by then I was honestly hangry. We were seated in one of the private rooms which had been converted to seat 4 round tables for the morning. Our waitress was attentive and she came back shortly after we sat down to ask what tea and set our utensils, bowls and a plate for each of us. There was another gentleman who asked us if everything was good and was chatting with other visitors as well. 

The food here is of higher quality and I didn't taste much MSG. We ordered shrimp dumplings (har gow), siu mai, steamed spareribs, steamed beef & chestnut, steamed rice rolls, chicken feet, custard bun, rice rolls with fried dough, char siu bao and by the end of it all, we were stuffed to the brim. *belch*

The regular price for dim sum is: 
S - 3.68; M - 4.68; L - 5.68; XL - 6.68, SP - 7.68 
They've got a special from M-F (excluding holidays) where all sizes are 3.68 before 11AM. 

I'd say yes, it is steep for dim sum as we ended up paying about 17 a person w/ the cost of tea. The food quality does justify the price. They use whole leaf tea and come back with a second pouch when you ask them to add hot water :o 

I'll most likely be back in the summer time as I'm not one to dim sum every week...still don't understand how some of my family friends do it."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a Friday night to celebrate my grandma's birthday.  We ordered a set meal for a party of 13 (and you have to order the set meal in advance so they can prepare).

The restaurant was accommodating because my family doesn't eat pork.  We had the \"pin pei\" duck as a starter and some of the notable dishes we had was the maggi lobster.  

Overall, the food quality here is good. If I was to compare I feel like the food they make here is a tad above the average for Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"This review is for their dim sum only although I have been here once for dinner before. 

First off was the ridiculously long wait to get seated. The entire ordeal lasted longer than one hour. It even took some time before we could even get a number. We arrived at nearly 1pm and it was 2:10 when we submitted our order. There's no pricing anywhere which isn't very helpful. 

When we sat down, it became increasingly apparent that the service here was downright poor to terrible. This place is severely understaffed: tables were being cleared and set up slowly, the TWO ladies serving the food were operating way too slowly, and there just weren't enough of those guys that take away your plates, refills your tea and stuff. There were also only two in the entire place! We didn't order much and it took over 10 minutes for each dish to come out (one at a time - seriously?) which was unacceptable at this point. It got so bad that we waited for over 20 minutes for the last dish and just said forget it and signaled for the bill.

It would have been fine had the dim sum was good but the food itself wasn't even anything special and was simply average. The portions were on the low side and prices were premium as well. The only real positive was the décor and cleanliness of the place (And the dual chopstick setup!) It definitely is one of the more 'fancier' like dim-sum places. 

I definitely would not recommend coming here for dim sum. Incredibly mediocre, low portioned food combined at premium prices with even worse service makes this place a clear no-go. That's four strikes."}
{"text":"So I came here on a Wednesday morning. It was a bit quiet probably because of the cold weather and march break. It got busier at around 11, that's probably when the kids woke up. The service is good and the dimsum was fresh. Morning specials are $3.30 before 12 pm and tea price is $1.50/ person. The pineapple bbq pork bun and shrimp har gou are good. The bbq pork cheung fun (rice roll) is too thick. I also ordered a fried fish cake which was alright but lacked flavor. Overall, the dim sum is alright but I don't think it is worth $3.30. Especially when there are other options around with similar pricing that offers dim sum quality matching its price.

{"text":"dined at this restaurant to pre-celebrate Father's Day trying to avoid the crowd on Sunday. This restaurant is spacious with warm welcoming waiters and waitresses. This restaurant has a good reputation and making a reservation is highly recommend. Ordered a roasted pork with jellyfish, Fish (yellow flat tail) with tofu and vegetables and oysters in red wine.

Roasted pork was crispy and the jellyfish was chewy. The Yellow Flat Tail fish was excellent. I like the texture of the meat. It tastes fresh. Only the tofu on the side tasted a but strange and reported to one of the waiters. For safety reason, the waiter suggested to cancel this dish and reorder another dish. We were happy to receive this offer. Last but not least, the oysters cooked in red wine. The oysters were huge and tasted great. I like the way that it brought in some of the western style ingredients to the dish, with spring vegetables to balance the taste of the rich red vine and the light salad. 

I will have to say, other than the delicious food, I will come back because of their great service."}
{"text":"Overall this place didn't give me a good experience. We made reservation for a dinner at 8pm and we didn't actually get seated until 8:45pm. We ordered their winter melon soup and it wasn't the tastiest. My parents cook a better version...and it wouldn't cost us $65 before tax. Their dishes are quite tasty though, but along a bit on the pricy side. Dishes could be cleaner, tea they serve is quite good and the environment is quite clean and spacious. I asked them to split the bills since I was paying for a portion of it , and they had a fit. On top of that they told the other party that I had not tip them on my end so that they could give more. Very sneaky and unprofessional . Some of the staff there aren't well mannered and the restaurant overall just take of their own self interest first. In my previous visit, they ran out of their steam chicken and either crab/lobster too."}
{"text":"Food is great, dishes have stink on it, please wash the dishes and tea cups better. I would recommend you to have reservation because this place is at a famous Chinese spot now, it's packed no matter what. Price is expensive but you can't expect cheap price when every house around this area are millions of dollars. Their cha Siu rice is so good. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Overall 3/5
Typical uptown Markham Chinese dim sum place.
It's located in a plaza of sorts and can be easily missed if you're not looking for that place specifically.

Food 4/5
Decent.

Value 2/5
More expensive than typical dim sum places in Toronto, a bit above the median in the area.
We got a discount of 10% and free tea, which is somewhat the norm for anyone the staff recognise. Most dim sum places offer a nominal discount to a lot of customers as it makes them feel more special so you don't actually have to be VIP or a super regular.


Atmosphere 4/5
It's a dim sum place, so being loud is the baseline. It wasn't excessively loud and the atmosphere was a little bit above average.

Service 3/5
It's around average."}
{"text":"No stranger to this establishment, I visited this place many times, for dinner, for dim sum and even for a wedding, before and after renovations. (I even bumped into a famous chef from HK and took a picture with him ^_^) Let's just said this restaurant has improved so much, in terms of service and décor after renovation. I had a not so pleasant experience at Skyview and that was before the change.  My family and I our spring roll dish \"stolen\" right before our eyes by their regular customer and the waiters of course lied to their teeth and denied it ever happened despite what we just saw. 
 
Skyview is one of the best upscale dim sum places in Markham and along with its sister restaurant Dragon Boat, everyone wants to go there for dim sum. Patrons know the food is of high quality despite the dim sum being more expensive.  The menu is very similar to Dragon Boat, same font and all. Some of the innovative dishes are available at both locations.  There is dim sum special during Monday to Friday morning only.

Parking can be a nightmare as there is very limited parking in the small plaza. You can park on the street or just park at Costco and walk five minutes back. 

I would rate Skyview a weak 3.5 and the only reason it is getting 3.5 is for its high caliber dishes and the staff who served at our table and for the waitress for patientily dealing with the bill. Why 3.5 and not a higher rating? Because the restaurant is incapable of managing its crowd, resulting in an extremely bad seating system. I guess with success and popularity comes with overcrowding. 

Do not attempt to ever go dim sum as a group for 1pm on the weekend because you will end up waiting so long for a table that it will test your patience! I saw a group of 5 waiting for close to two hours.  Even with reservations, people had to wait for a long time and this was unfortunately the case for me and the group I was with (i never go dim sum this late). I originally came at 12:50 pm thinking the dim sum was at 1pm. My friend said she called and reserved a table for 7 people the day before and they told her the time was for 1:30pm.  Turns out they wrote down 1:15pm for the reservation time. The attendant finally found the reservations and wrote it down on a separate smaller pad in her hand and added the reservation to the list of tables who already had reservations but were still waiting to be sat down, some who had reservations that were still for 1pm. Fast forward 1:45pm, we were still not being sat down and as I found out, there were about 4 tables of similar size as mine waiting from similar reservation time slot .

A table reservation is an arrangement made in advance to have a table available at the restaurant at the indicated time and day. Unfortunately, Skyview does not understand what a reservation is.  Why bother offering a reservation if you can't honor it? What was the point of a reservation?  To lure people in hoping they would stay or hoping the earlier clientele would leave quickly?  I think there is a problem with the restaurant if you end up taking reservations for groups and cannot offer tables of that size at the mentioned time. Skyview might as well get rid of the reservations system and do just a first come first serve basis for weekends.
 
Customers were getting nasty and angry due to the long wait!  Even a lady was calling out the attendant for giving regular clientele tables faster.  She accused the attendant based on what she saw and starting to create a scene by raising her voice. She was tired of waiting incessantly. The attendant told her to stop hounding and following her. She told the lady to go speak the manager if she has an issue but the lady kept going on about the unfairness. In the end, the lady followed the attendant and disappeared into the crowd. I guess she got her table! 

I am no stranger of waiting for a table, even with reservations. I experienced this at Dragon Boat, Skyview, Casa Victoria etc. but this was a new record!  My group ended up waiting an hour to be exact!  We were the last people standing in the end with everyone already inside and got seated at 2:15pm, exactly an hour of our reservations time. As for me, being always an early bird, I ended up standing for a whopping 90 minutes. Customers who were also waiting as a group but didn't have reservations but were there earlier got seated first. It was like the restaurant only had a few limited table size for groups of 5+. Couldn't they have given us a bigger table??! It was unbelievable!

Do not make reser for 1 to 130pm..u will end up waiting 1 hr+ with about 5 different groups waiting for the same table size! If you do attempt to go at 1pm (and don't said I didn't warned you), go with 2 or 3 people at most. You will get seated faster. I saw so many people being seated in just under 15 min wait due to its small size table.  Or if you do want to go as a group, show up much earlier. Just get up earlier - It will be so worth it  :P"}
{"text":"This used to be a fine dining Chinese cuisine, however, on Tuesday, I got really sick from their food. Only ordered soup, veggies, steamed fish and bbq pork. Unfortunately, I went to the bathroom nine times within the next twelve hours....their good quality has really deteriorated..."}
{"text":"My experience here was fairly satisfactory. When I ate at this place, I did not experience and \"fusion cuisine\", but more like a traditional Chinese banquet dinner. I went here for a birthday banquet for my grandmother, and we had a large room reserved for my family. It was a set of 7+ dishes, some fried rice, the Cantonese style \"longevity noodles\" and some sweet buns. 

The food overall here was fairly average, especially the Ginger and Scallion Lobster, along with the Man Cheung Gai, also known as the Wen Chang Hainanese Chicken.  The flavour was good, but there was nothing amazing about the dishes, and I thought I had better versions of the dishes in Markham or other parts of Toronto area. The other seafood dishes, such as the shrimp, and a couple fish dishes were tasty, but mainly satisfactory to my tastes. The fried rice and noodles were also tasty, but also satisfactory. I felt that I just had a big dinner, but not a really great dinner. 

The interior was modern and a nice contemporary look. Service was fairly prompt, the people on my table loved taking pictures of the dishes that were served here, so they were courteous to let us take pictures, before they began preparing to serve the dishes. The enjoyable part was that I saw my relatives. 

Overall, this is not a bad place if you want a decent Chinese style banquet in Markham. I have a feeling it is not the best place, but I think they can do a decent job preparing for banquets. The seafood they serve here is also not a bad choice as well. Will I come back here again? If my family insists on it."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????d.??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d?????d???????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very upset about this place, ordered the steamed live whole fish and the fish is not even fresh at all. Bad experience"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for a midweek dim sum at noon and this place was packed! Despite the crowdedness, the design of the restaurant didn't make it difficult to talk, even across the table, as some restaurants could be very loud. 

I loved that the order sheet shows pictures of some of the dim sums and the number that it corresponds with. I ordered the deep fried taro with quail egg because it looked interesting on the sheet. Taste-wise, I would say it is a step up from other dim sum places that I've tried. Even though there's a bit of a wait time for the dim sum, it is super fresh, hot, and delicious!

The only reason why I'm only giving it a four star is because they missed one of my orders--even when we circled it--and we were waiting for some time until we realized that it was left out. I would recommend doubling checking with the waiter/waitress taking your order sheet to make sure he/she knows what you ordered."}
{"text":"We came here early Saturday morning and there were only 2 members of their staff here, so everything was very slow and disorganized at first. Food was okay, better than your average dim sum place, but their prices are fair bit higher too. After the initial bump of few staff, the service did get better and tea was refilled regularly. When we ended up leaving at around 11am, there was a huge crowd/line up at the door, so I guess it wasn't that bad coming early on the weekend."}
{"text":"The restaurant serves really good dim sum and it offers early bird specials. Unfortunately, not all hosts/hostesses are friendly. Our hostess Rita talk back and gave an attitude when I requested if my family and I could sit at a different table. Good grief, it wasn't a demand but a request.  The dim sum selection was good and fresh ingredients were used. Definitely come here for the food."}
{"text":"Food is average , the service is horrible and attitude is even worse!!!  They are sooo rude !  Void this place."}
{"text":"I thought I wrote a review for this place but I guess not...this is one of the better Dim Sum places after Dragon Boat, the line is better than Dragon Boat for sure in terms of waiting...

Came with my family/friends on Monday but I made reservations the day before as it was regular price so that was allowed...Thankfully...We arrived and the line was huge...I overheard the lady tell people the wait was approximately 1-1.5 hours...I went over and said I have reservations....we were seated in under 10 mins...Woohoo!!! 

It was a very busy day so I think the service was slightly compromised due to insufficient number of staff but nonetheless, the food was still delicious...it is quite difficult to find dim sum for an average price with not bad quality..I have to say..

The cheap places nowadays still charge like $2.80 per dish, so paying $3.30 instead for better quality is definitely a steal imo...

I will be back without hesitation..."}
{"text":"Racist. If you aren't Asian, don't set foot in there. They don't want your business. They did everything they could to ignore that I was even in the restaurant. That being said, I stood firm. They overcharged me so badly I should have called police. $38 for soup and some veg stir fry. Unbelievable. The creepy giant video playing is bad enough."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant that I went to in my life for dim sum. Waited 1 hour to be seated. The dishes took one hour to come. Food was expensive and still left the restaurant hungry. Food came every 10 minutes or longer. If I could give zero Stars or negative Stars I would. I will never come back to this restaurant again even if you paid me to. Food was substandard and not spectacular. 

Sadly the Decor looked better. Service was so bad and slow. How does it take one hour to get 6 dim sum dishes out? 1 dim sum didnt even come and and we waited 15 minutes for it. 

Staff were so slow at serving and making tables for the next guests."}
{"text":"Meh, Nothing to rave about. Peking duck skin was not cut very well, too much fat left on it, food quite salty, fried fish and zucchini was almost all batter and no fish or vegetable. Service normal..."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese restaurant in Toronto. Must try their BBQ port bun at dim sum time and BBQ pork at dinner."}
{"text":"Made reservation for 2 at 12pm. Waited for 50 min, table is still not yet ready. Suggested sharing table with other ppl but was refused by receptionist! Bad service. No control."}

Comments
- BBQ Pork is a definitely \"must-try\" here, its pretty darn amazing. 
- Service is mediocre | Manager was good, but the rest was just un-enthusiastic, un-willing to work/move. 
- Food came out in batches, making a full a 9 course dinner service kind of odd | took them roughly 45 minutes to service all 9 dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with a party of 9 during the weekday.  Weekday promo - small, med & large variety all $3.50.  Restaurant is spacious, clean and decent decor.

Lots of dim sum options.  We were starving so ordered crazy amount of dishes...ranging from standard staples shrimp bonnets, siew mais, chicken feet, rice noodles, etc.  They were all delicious. 

Now you must wonder where the 2 stars come from....waitstaff (exclude food runners)...not just one but every one we'd encountered were SUPER rude.  They did not want to help, serve and simply can't be bothered.  I get Asian style but it was way beyond the tolerance zone. 

With the weekday special promos, we still managed to spend over $100...guess some items we'd ordered were XL options.  Another stinker was cash only during promo hours (though this was not listed anywhere)."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Crowded and noisy on the weekend. Egg tarts okay. Shrimp rolls were terrible. Menu is limited. Royal Teahouse close by menu is Sooooo much better as is the quality of ALL the food. This was my first and LAST time for dim sum. Unfortunately very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for dim Sim. It was good and great presentation but a little pricey. Did  not mind this  but was very disappointed with the rude hostess and long wait. I asked hostess the approx wait time but she said she did not know. We waited close to 90 minutes. The worse was we called for reservations and she said they do not take it but when we got there there were reservations. Also regulars or friends get priority and less wait time. I know restaurants do this but do not make it so obvious. Will not be back due to the service and management attitude and treatment of customers."}
{"text":"Love the food. Not a fan of the wait. It's important to come at the right time if you want to beat the line up as it can get crowded. 

The dim sum was delicious. Ironically, the BBQ pork (Char siu) rice good only because when you go to dim sum, you do not think of just getting BBQ pork and rice.

Other then that, we usually get the typical dim sum food such as siu mai, har gow (shrimp dumpling), congee and they're all pretty good. 

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to start off by saying this place has the best chicken feet that I have had in a very long time. I tend to skew towards liking a place if they have phenomenal feet. :P Everything else was pretty good as well. We ordered the standard Har Gow, and Siu Mai. The Steamed Rice and Pork wrapped in Leaves were the perfect portion and did not cheap out on the pork, and I'd say the squid was pretty on par to above average. 

We arrived at 10:30 for a table of 2. Mind you they have early bird special from 9:00-11:00am. We were on a wait list but there were tables that were free. I feel like they were just waiting it out until the early bird order deadline of 10:50am, because they sat us down literally minutes right after. The table was spick and span and there were no traces of anyone even leaving. 

I'd give the place a 3 star but the chicken feet had to bump them up to a 4/5. I highly recommend showing up early and of course getting the chicken feet. If you take my advice you'll have a great dim sum experience. JimStar Out!"}
{"text":"This place is buzzing so don't be surprised if there is a lineup for a table. Steamed dumplings, BBQ pork buns and sticky rice are all pretty decent. There's lots of shrimp in the dumplings. Deep fried squid could be crispier. All in all, you'll get quick service and yummy dim sum. No Chinese required."}
{"text":"First time going there. The food was great. Really authentic chinese cuisines. Get food pretty quickly. 
It's a very typical asian restaurant. Not a long communication with the servers. It's really just business business. But I don't mind it cause the food was really good.

Long waiting time though to get in. 

Just for a cultural knowledge if ever you are wondering why there are 2 pairs of eating sticks beside you. 
Well the black color sticks is the one you used to eat and the red one is the one you will used to takw food from the main plates to your own plates.
You are welcome"}
{"text":"I've seen Skyview Fusion every time I go to Costco but I didn't know anything about it. I heard they had good dim sum so it when the chance to go there came up, I was in.

It took about an hour to get a table for two. This place must be good. The decor is nice, with large modern looking chandeliers that kinda made a bold statement.

My friend took care of the ordering, six dishes. It took a little longer than expected to arrive or maybe it just felt that way since we were getting hungry after the long wait.

The dishes were very nicely presented, whether plattered or in custom made steamer baskets. Even a couple of familar dishes were prepared and presented differently from other places I've been to. Nicely done.

I've never had the deep fried taro with ground pork prepared this way with a quail's egg but it was very nice, both visually and tastewise. Even a simple dish of fried dough in rice roll was plated nicely and tasted very good.

The siu mai (pork dumplings), spareribs with black beans, and steamed bean curd rolls with mushrooms were all very good. So was the baked BBQ pork buns.

It's a little pricier than most of the places I go to for dim sum but the whole experience is a little better so I guess you get what you pay for. The food and presentation were all good enough for a return visit. Now if we could only do something about the long wait..."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time after it changed owner.  This is an upscale restaurant and it reflects on the prices of the dim sum..  I took a photo of the dim sum menu, it looks very nice and show pictures of some of the dim sum. One can enlarge the menu and can clearly see the description of the items. The entrance is vastly improved from the old one.  The decor is good and service is good too.  The quality of the dim sum is a mix bag, based on what we ordered, see photos.  Overall, we have a good experience and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I went for a dim sum lunch at full price.  The quality of the dim sum is okay for the price; however, it is still quite a bit of money for dim sum.  For similar price, I prefer the dim sum and the selection at Diamond Banquet Hall.  For slightly more, I prefer the dim sum at Elegance Cuisine.  To me, this is the place to go if I want better seating than Diamond, but not because of the food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for dimsum and BBQ pork. I have here mainly for dimsum and the food is never disappointing. My must orders are shrimp dumpling (aka har gow), shrimp and pork dumpling (aka siu mai), BBQ pork pineapple bun, rice roll with dough fritter and XO sauce, and BBQ pork rice dish. Usually there is a wait but worth it. I believe you can make reservations for bigger parties."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences at a restaurant that I've ever had.  It took them a half hour to take our order and then another half hour to receive the first dish.   When we inquired into the delay with our order, the manager was not helpful at all.  He mumbled something to us and walked away.  It was only after repeated inquires that the food started coming an hour and half after arriving. 
I understand delays or mistakes can happen, but the most frustrating part of the experience was the non existent attempt at any service recovery. 
Needless to say, this was one of those experiences that makes one decide never to return to a restaurant.  There are so many other options in this area, why bother.  
The food itself was fine, nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a weekday around 10am. There was already lineups, 8 tables ahead of us, this place has crazy lineups. We got lucky and was seated after half an hour wait. Ordered before 11am (just in time for early bird special) $3.68 for S, M, L. Overall, the food came out at a good pace. The place is renovated after the new management by Dragon Boat Fusion, and this place serves high end tea! They also give you a packet on the side. We got the Iron Buddha tea. I would highly recommend this place for dim sum on a weekday, for weekends a reservation is a must! The Early Bird special is good value and the dishes are presented nicely! 

We ordered the following: 
- fried dough \"Ja Leung\" 4/5
- Beef \"Cheung fun\" 3/5
- Shrimp \"ha gow\" 3/5
- Fried almond shrimp balls 5/5
- BBQ Pineapple Buns 4/5
- Seafood dumping in soup 5/5
- Mango Coconut Dessert (basket)--5/5 for presentation, 3/5 Value --good for photos 
- Pork \"Siu Mai\" 3/5"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at about 12:30 noon time. There was a huge line up which takes my curiosity up a notch. Why is it so busy even though early bird special is done? So we waited and waited and finally after about an hour we were seated. 

($3 Small, $4 Medium, $5 Large, $6 Extra Large)
early bird special before 11am is still $3.20 for S,M,L

Most of the wait staff were older women so I can see why there was such a long wait. There were only a few men working to clear the tables so you would see empty tables piled with dirty dishes and no one clearing them off. And meanwhile there is still a large lineup so I can see why the wait was so long.

The cook staff is much faster. After about two minutes of placing our order we got our first dish. Everything tasted good and fresh. I would rate the food 3.5 to 4 stars overall. The one dish we ordered that I really liked was the chicken pot pie pastry puff. 

I would still recommend Casa Imperial Fine Dining as my #1 choice for dim sum in terms of quality of food. This one is not bad though except for the initial long wait."}
{"text":"The good:

This was probably the best looking dim sum restaurant I've been to. The tea was good, lots of room to move around and be be cramped up.

The bad: 

The server lady gave me a bad cut eye for asking for more time on the menu. Hey maybe it's the stress of the job, but aside from that, there wasn't much negative about this place.

The neutral:

The food. Maybe I'm a picky dim sum eater, but I still very much prefer dragon boat fusion over this place. But to one their own :) it's still good!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised there's only 3 stars but I think there is a discrepancy between lunch and dinner because my mother and I have similar tastes in food and she told me lunch was not half as good.  Dinner was an extremely pleasant experience with my family and we had the following dishes: 

1) BBQ pork - If you don't like any fat in your BBQ pork, then this isn't for you.  It's a little bit fatty (which makes it so tender) but not fatty to the point where it's disgusting and overwhelming.  The sauce was the part that really got me hooked to this dish.  It's a very lovely sweet salty sauce, which made the pork taste extra delicious.  The pork is laid on a bed of beans, which are also yummy with that crack sauce as well :P. 

2) Oysters - These are pan fried oysters in a similar sweet salty sauce.  Again, DELICIOUS.  The oysters are plump and juicy.  LOVED this dish - a must try. 

3) Salted baked chicken - Meh.  It was okay - like any other chicken.  It's hard to come by good chicken in Canada anyway (as opposed to Asia). 

4) Baby broccoli - A fresh dish but it wasn't anything special.  It's just like any other veggie dish you can get at a Chinese restaurant. 

5) \"Soup of the day\" - It was a broth mixture of some sort but nevertheless, was very good.  It wasn't laden with MSG, which was a perk! 

All in all, I think the MSG index in this place is 0 - which is GREAT.  (I'm a MSG monster and will react hugely to any MSG in my food).  I don't get the \"fusion\" part of this restaurant because as far as I saw in the menu, it was pretty Chinese.  We did have to wait a while before someone led us to a table.  But afterwards, our server was very courteous and polite.  The ambiance is ...bright - like a Chinese restaurant.  

My mother came back for dim sum and said that their siu mai's were disgusting because they added watercress to it.  Who does that?? :("}
{"text":"This is a beautiful, bright, spotless dining room with great service. 

I was torn between rating this a three or a four. The deciding factor came down to the very long weight for the char siu.

We arrived just after 1030 for family dim sum on a Saturday. A subset of the menu items including the char siu are not available before 1100, but you can order them at the same time as everything else. 

We ordered for five:
Har gau - these were the usual, tasty and simple
Siu mai - these were beautiful with a plump shrimp on top of each
Fried Glutinous dumplings - very hot and crispy. Delicious
Char Siu Cheung Fon - the pork tasted a bit unique. These were good
Dough fritter XO Cheung Fon - I think these were XL, but worth it. A treat!
Fish stuffed eggplant and peppers - these were a nice small size and not greasy. Well done.
Char Siu - this was sticky and dropping with sweet syrup. It was very good. We took half of it to go.

Most of the food arrived within minutes and was fully consumed by 1100. The char siu arrived at 1130."}
{"text":"I came here twice on a Sunday and the line is ridiculous, I was told each time that I would only have to wait 20mins and I waited at least 45mins each time....I should have left when we got the chance but we were all craving dim sum
Service is pretty crappy hear, we waved some other to take out order and they just put in the order on the keyboard to let another server Input, one the waitress spilled some soy sauce on my friends phone and didn't even bother apologizing 

The food is okay but pricy for the service and decor here, mind you that it use to be a dance club where someone died before"}
{"text":"Quality food. Clean place. Nice decor. Service a bit slow. Higher price. Limited parking. Nice rooms for parties."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here, and won't ever be back. The food is good, the servers were efficient, but the managers made me feel very unwelcome. 

I went for dim sum, and got there by 10:20, to make it for the pre-11am discounted dim sum price. I was seated by 10:50, but was charged full price when the bill came. Apparently, they announced early that the discounted price time was over, but in Chinese, so I was unaware when my number came up. It didn't matter that I was seated before 11am or that I couldn't understand their warning. They had entered it on the iPad, and that was that. I was polite but insistent that this wasn't right, but they went with the, \"we told you\" line and then walked away and ignored me until they saw me pull cash out of my wallet, at which point I suddenly existed again. 

Bottom line, it's good food in a restaurant run by bad people. Whether you go or not depends on what's important to you. Just don't expect them to care about you if you're unhappy."}
{"text":"Pros:
Dim sum well prepared
Not as crammed as other places

Cons:
Long wait time for dishes to come out

My wife's family usually does Mother's Day for my mother in law the week before Mother's Day.  We came here for dim sum so the review only covers the dim sum portion of the day.  

You can make reservation for dim sum here which is nice.  My wife's family now is up to 21 so we usually need at least 2 tables.  Skyview is not the biggest restaurant that does dim sum, but it does have a lot of larger tables which make it ideal for larger groups.  What I really liked about Skyview is that it's not as cramped as other dim sum places are.  There's a good amount of space between the tables and you're not just stuck in place because you have no where to move.

Skyview's menu is not as vast other places, but what they do, they do pretty well.  I was very satisfied with almost every item we ordered.  The bean curd roll was the only item I didn't really like.  There was way too much celery for my liking.  My fav item at dim sum is the chicken feet and they do a very good one here.  When you order cold water, they give you glasses with ice and bottled water.  Most places will just give you tap water so that's a nice plus for those who don't drink tap water.

So my brother in law got to the restaurant first at about 1030am.  He placed an order b about 1040am.  Some of the food he ordered did not come to about 1130am.  That's a bit too long in my opinion.  I think about 20 minutes for when it's busy is the standard.  Anything longer and obviously something is not working.  That was the only blemish during our visit.

I'm a fan of Skyview for dim sum.  It was a pleasant experience for the most part.  I'm hoping the long wait for food was just an aberration if anything.  I will be making a visit in the future to confirm."}
{"text":"My cousins tell me that Skyview has one of the best dim sum in Toronto. Having only tried a handful of places the few times I have visited Toronto, all I can say is a dim sum at Skyview is similar in many ways to what you get in the bay area but the execution it's just better. 
The menu features the same cantonese classics. The least of what we ordered was as good as what we got at ABC or Yank Sing while the best was definitely a cut above.

Try the chicken feet, the various dumpling combinations or the har gaw. It is all good."}
{"text":"Overpriced Chinese foods. I wasn't sure why my family decided on a place so far from home yet so mediocre in taste. To be honest, nothing stood out. My husband went home hungry even though we ordered a table full of foods. The noodles were mushy, the mapo tofu was bland, the stir fry dishes were overwhelming greasy. Not sure if it was because we didn't eat enough, we didn't suffer from post msg overload thirst (plus back one star). Overall - if we end up eating here again, definitely not my choice."}
{"text":"I came here a little while back for a family dinner. The food was good and the price point was decent (some are more expensive, but you do get more than what you pay for. 
My wife and I went again today for lunch dim sum. Overall, it was a disappointment. It is not because the place is bad, but the quality of the dim sum is just okay on average. Each dish that we ordered, except for the BBQ Pork Bun, we can find something about them that makes it unbalanced. The worst of it was with the Sweet Egg Twist. It was so dense it was like biting into a fried biscuits, and the centre of each bite tasteless (it was so thick and dense, the honey couldn't get to it.
The server was surprised we barely touched it and did not pack it. It was disappointing that, though we explained to her the problem, she didn't do anything about it. She didn't take it off the bill, or anything else.
We WILL be back for dinner, but not dim sum."}
{"text":"I came here for a late dim sum with my family to see my godmother's baby grandson. So, of course knowing how busy it can get we made a reservation. However, we were waiting for a good 30 minutes before seating even with a reservation..  
Anyway, if you are willing to wait, you will be rewarded with some bomb ass food. 
I don't normally have dim sum all that often since I don't live my parents anymore. So, I'm no longer a \"regular weekly dimsum-er\" but I can still tell when I'm having some excellent food.
The food here is always hot, always consistent and beautifully presented. 
There are waaay too many dim sum items to go through individually but i'll mention some AAA quality stuff that is NOT the usual Har Gow and Siu Mai 
- EGG YOLK BUN ***** (my fav but don't eat too many, they are hella fattening)
- Steamed Rice Noodle (many varieties, ranging from plain, BBQ pork, Shrimp etc)

{"text":"Expensive for the quality of food. Honestly, this dim sum restaurant is nothing out of the ordinary. There wasn't a dish that really wow-ed me nor was I completely disappointed. You are looking at regular price dim sum during the weekends. Many people expect this place to be packed on a Saturday/Sunday morning but it wasn't. The tea they served was also average quality. It could be tasted that the quality of their tea leaves are just mediocre. I probably will return but not any time soon. Get into the plaza via the back road by york tech, woodbine is busy especially during costco working hours."}
{"text":"Skyview restaurant 

We came here for dimsum on a Wednesday. There was no line and we were seated right away. 

The restaurant is very clean and looks more on the up scale side. Service is prompt and efficient. The price is comparable to the more upscale restos like dragon boat and Yangs. Our bill came up to $155 for 8 people which is on the higher side compare to restaurants that offers a flat rate for all sizes.  With all that being said, the food was worth paying for.  Everything tasted delicious, with the right texture and flavour.  Their Cha Sui is a must order! It was sooooo tender with the perfect balance of sweet and salty. I love that it was mostly lean meat and served with with rice and a fried egg. 

I would definitely come back here for the food and experience"}
{"text":"Before Dragon Boat Fusion took control of Skyview Fusion last December, my rating would have been 4 stars. The Skyview menu, at least the dim sum menu, matches the Dragon Boat menu, the food tastes a lot better and the decor has improved. Service is great. The restaurant is very clean. Skyview Fusion is now one of the best Cantonese dim sum restaurants in the GTA. The line ups to get in are growing; testament to the great food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday morning with my family.  We miss authentic dim sum and were thrilled to be introduced to this restaurant.  We ordered 7 dishes and were very satisfied!  The best item were the warm pineapple char siu buns.  Oohhh, they just very perfect in texture contrast and flavors!  The chiu chow dumplings had a thin wrapper and were steamed perfectly.  The portugese chicken tarts were bite size and delicious!  Looking forward to visiting Markham again just so we can eat dim sum there!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast dim sum.  The food is good, but maybe because we came at 9am, there wasn't much choice of dim sum.  Whatever we ordered though was very good.  The place is very fancy."}
{"text":"3.5

Fair and effective service as expected for such places.

Dumpling list is relatively limited compared to some other places like this one. Honey BBQ ribshorts is a must. Other menu items are more on the so so side for most of them. Sauce is given in very small portions."}
{"text":"According to my friend, the restaurant was shut down for a while and re-opened recently and she said that the dimsum here is really good, and she is not wrong!

Of course, as per usual with her, we happily overordered. Between the three of us, we had:
- shrimp dumplings (hargow)
- Siumai (what's that in english?)
- beef meatballs
- beef rice noodle roll (chunfun)
- chicken feet
- stewed offals
- chiuchow style dumplings (funguo)
- beef broth with delicious beef, delicious soup, and delicious dipping sauce

We probably ordered more but I can't seem to remember the rest of it.
I would come back, if not just for the beef broth alone."}
{"text":"Beware of sauce money! They charge for sauces like the chili and hoisin sauce on the side and don't tell you. Service is mediocre. Food (BBQ pork) was pretty good. Went approx 4 to 5
 months ago."}
{"text":"I was interested in trying a new place out as my parents recommended it. After arriving at 11:30am on Sunday, we waited 2 hours waiting in line with others irritated with not enough waiting space to the point where people were spilling into the dining area. When we finally got our table it was the one everyone would hate, closest to the door. As we were starving by now, we took it even with people standing around surrounding us waiting to be seated still. 

After we sat down at a dirty table, 5 minutes for them to clear it only to set a fresh set of still dirty dishes.  Another half hour before they came to take our order. At least they gave us tea which I guess we should be thankful for. A server kept bringing out food asking if we wanted some at least 3 times. After asking each time what it was he was trying to sell he just walked away. 

While dropping food off at the table another server slammed her tray into my chair almost dropping everything into the floor. The food quality I would say is average. It's what I would expect from a place like this for dim sum. The bbq pork rice looked good but a little on the sweet side as it was covered in sugar making it excessively sweet when you expect savoury.

From what I can tell from a service stand point. They simply don't have enough waiting staff. With the size of the establishment i would expect at least twice the amount of staff in order to get orders to customers to quickly turnover tables as fast as possible to generate maximum revenue.  

Overall I liked the steamed yolk egg bun the most out of all the food we ordered out of a table of 5. Even if the food was above average here, it is greatly over shadowed by the lack of support staff."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork is amazing here! It is just the perfect balance of fat and lean and very juicy. It also comes with a big side of sweet beans which are also really good, but I don't think you get the beans if you just get takeout. The dim sum here is more pricey than most other restaurants, but the quality of food and ambiance are worth the extra cost. It is bright and clean and the service is decent. I also like their bigger teacups so you are not constantly pouring tea. It is quite popular so wait times can be a turn off, but as is the case with most Chinese dim sum places."}
{"text":"Back for Skyview's dim sum special $2.80 if order before 10:50 am on weekdays.

If you do want to take advantage of the special, be sure to be here at least 30 minutes or more to wait for a table. If not, you won't be happy to pay full price for their dim sum.

Most of the dim sum we ordered were A-OK. But the kitchen seemed to overcooked some of the items: the shrimp rice roll and siu mai. The Crab Soup Dumpling which is suppose to be an XL was disappointing: bland and hardly have any filling, even at discount pricing, I would not order that again.

I doubt I would be paying full price for dim sum at Skyview at least with what they offering now. Hoping they would improve on their choice and quality!"}
{"text":"Visited here on a Tuesday around 10AM and got seated immediately.  They have special price for Dim Sum(S, M & L) for $3.50 for order before 11AM and pay before noon.  Har Gaw and Siu Mai both are XL, so each priced at $7.

Foods quality here are average and portion are normal. 

Overall this is a great place for morning tea if you are not fans of Har Gaw and Siu Mai."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and everything came out tasty and nicely prepared.  Nothing was overly salty.  The Peking Duck was nicely presented and you don't have to order in advance.  There was a lot of fat left on though.  The family dinner prices went up by over $100 from a 6 person dinner to a 8-10 person dinner.  Reservations are needed especially during prime dinner time at and around 7pm.  
Went back to Dim Sum and everything was freshly prepared and hot.  For the early dim sum, things that are available are only limited to the dim sum menu and can't order from the other menu until after early dim sum."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place because my family had it before and it was amazing. This was my first time here and they ordered food they already tried that were amazing. It is a very pretty restaurant that had wine bottles hanging on a wall. The food was horrendous and the rice that we ordered was cold and not fluffy like day old rice. I would not recommend this place especially since it was so expensive. 

The dishes look great but the food was horrible!"}
{"text":"my experience was for Dim Sum .. so i can only speak for that. 

there was a line up to get in i made it just in time for the early bird dim sum.

overall, nothing special and overpriced.  

i remember the good old days where it was just S, M, L ... none of that XL, Special, Jumbo and overpriced dishes..

food was so so, did not impress me at all.. and for that price, there are far more impressive dim sum joints in the area with more unique dimsum with more importantly delicious."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for dim sum and after arriving there, there were like 20 people  in the waiting area, I still had to wait like 10 mins. Even the waiting time was not so long and the waiting area was bigger than many Chinese restaurants,  it was still uncomfortable to be among many aggressive older/middle age people trying to get tables. 

Inside the restaurant, it was pretty spacious. It took us a long time to get the attention of the waitress/waiter to take our orders. I think they were just too busy. The food was average, but it really depends on what you order. If you order the standard items, they rarely go wrong anywhere. 

If you go after 1pm in the weekend, I think there is no line up.  If I ever go there again, I would pick a time with no line up."}
{"text":"Customer service is incredibly unacceptable. Unsure of how they have customers.

- The hostess was unfriendly, rude and unprofessional
- Food did not come out until an hour later and we had to follow up many times on the wait time - we have a feeling she told the kitchen staff/manager to do this as she yelled at us for sitting at the wrong table
- The manager, Tommy, ignored us when we tried to flag him down to talk to him about the issue 
- When the issue was brought to the manager's attention, he yelled/argued back with us

There are so many dim sum places around Markham, do not come to this one - just read the other one star reviews."}
{"text":"These 5 stars go toward the incredible Cha Siu! 
Recommend meatballs, sticky rice, and rice noodles with peanut sauce."}
{"text":"My rating for this restaurant was flip-flopping between 4 and 5 stars just soon after I finished eating.  However. I ended up giving this place a 3 star rating.

As most people have probably noted, you must be prepared to shell out a bit of cash to eat at this place.  I decided to do the dinner time run rather than the typical dimsum run tonight after some light shopping at Costco.

This place more or less is comparable to the level of Crown Jewel or Casa Imperial in terms of decor, service and price.

Service wise, terrible English support.  However, I was willing to let go of that fact in my rating tonight.

We ordered two crab balls at $6.50 each.  At a price difference of fifty-cents between here and Crown Jewel, this place was far far better in taste and amount of REAL crab in the crab ball.  The paste they used also didn't taste like the shrimp paste of Crown Jewel, I think they infused it with more of the crab stock so lessen the shrimp paste taste and after taste.

Second we ordered their House Premium Home Made Fried Rice at just under $21.  The rice was correctly done unlike the one I had last night at Mr. Congee.  Now the price may throw you off.  But the amount of rice they gave was more than normal and it was rich in flavor itself so you don't really need to eat much if you had some other dish to balance it off.  We had to take some home and I `gluttonized` some of it unnecessarily.

The rice was filled with many flavor ingredients including scallops, chicken thighs, shrimp, straw mushrooms and some dried orange thingy that I don't know what it is.  The \"premium\" flavor does come out.

They also provided us with dessert.

Note that they have a \"tea charge\" of $1.30.  Their Chrysanthemum Tea was slightly odd, in that it had a bitter taste to it, so I wasn't too keen on it.

If I wrote the review just after I finished the meal and paid for $44 for two people for a rice-filling dinner.  Then this would've been a toss-up between 4 and 5 stars.  It's good food and the price matches the food, service and ambiance.

However, when I got home their secret ingredient kicked in... MSG.  Knocked me out when I got home.  So after considering that they had to use a \"cheater ingredient\", I had demoted their score to a mere 3.  If I was in a bad mood or if I was annoyed that their staff didn't have anyone who can speak English to talk to us about the food like Jyo-san at Solo Sushi Ya or the owners of Casa Manila (both establishments BTW do not use MSG to my knowledge), I would've put them as a two."}
{"text":"I would make this post about the food...but my friends and I have been waiting for over an hour and a half. The seating system makes so sense! People who've made reservations well after we arrived have gone in first. Hostess is rude and lacks customer service skills. 

Once we were actually seated and had received our food, we were pleased. It could be that we were extremely hungry after waiting for such a long time or that the food was actually good. Guess we'll never know."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that as an Asian I am good with numbers.  For some reason, a lot of Chinese restaurants seem to get confused when number of people does not match the number of seats available at a table.
I got to Skyview a little early and asked for seating of 2.
40 long minutes later, a seat for two opened up.  Half the restaurant was empty but they made us wait until a table for 2 - yes only 2 can be seated at this table - was cleared.

Where's the logic?  Can't give me a table for 4, in case there was a rush of 4-somes?  Like a golf tournament was let out and they wanted Dim Sum in the middle of winter?  

We were at the tail end of the service and by the time we were done, the restaurant was empty.  Really quite the downer to a first time visit to this place.  

Now that my customary observation of obvious things are over, we carry on to what was a pretty decent dim sum offering.

I don't get to Dim Sum too often.  Very rare to find a friend that is available to share in the variety of delicious goodness.  Glad to have found an equally Dim Sum starved Yelper.

Skyview is located in the strip mall next to Costco.  They occupy many of the units starting from the east end, which is the entrance.  Parking can come at a premium if you arrive at peak times.  You could spill into the Costo parking lot and trek over if needed.  The place is well decorated and reminds me of Dragon Boat Fusion - I think someone mentioned they are the same owners.

My friend and I got into the menu pretty quickly.  Ordered up the standard fare.  HawGow, ShuiMai, ChunFun, Taro Puffs, Beef Balls...and so on.  

The food was quite delicious.  I'm not a fan of ShuiMai but I really liked it here.  The HawGow was nicely prepared and none of the dumpling skin came off - as so many do as you try to peel it out of the basket.  Also, found in the middle of the dish was a steamed prawn looking dead at me.  Hmmm...glad my friend had no qualms about having that as part of her lunch.  

I was not a big fan of the Taro.  I've had better.  Other than that, a fine late lunch was had by all...2 of us...at a table for 2.  

A 4 star food experience, a 3 star mathematical nightmare.  

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been here before it was renovated. Was kinda cheap looking and run down  sketchy, but went to dim sum on Saturday and wowza!! Renovated. Its clean and fancy!! 

The decor is not the only think that changed. The food is significantly better than it used to be. I think it's now comparable to other dim sum places in the area *cough*DragonBoatFusion*cough*

We got all the typical dim sum fare, buns, rice, rolls tentacles,tripe,congee. Pork buns were super. Also the rice rolls were extra yum!

I'll be coming back. I'm glad I have a new place to go!!"}
