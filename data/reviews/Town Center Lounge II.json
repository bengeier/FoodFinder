{"text":"Had a really bad day thought, why not enjoy a good burger?  God said,  nah bruh.  Ordered a BBQ burger with Cole slaw instead of fries, this wasn't a special request, just an option. They put the coleslaw in with the burger without a container. Therefore, the mayo soaked both buns. So, instead of a delicious meal, I got a soggy, bun less burger & dry coleslaw."}
{"text":"Did not eat. Good drinks and had Euroupean beer. Good service and atmosphere. Not too noisy and had TVs."}
{"text":"From day one I felt welcome to the bar, I hangout there with one of my good friends, and Robert is amazing, has wonderful social skills with his guests, makes great drinks and overall have a great time there."}
{"text":"Service was very slow,  had specials on a board but couldn't get them because they aren't available on weekends which isn't listed,  asked for creamer for coffee took 15 mins to get it, food was salty, no butter for toast. Got 3 full pieces of toast and only 1 grape and 1 strawberry jelly, this place is a joke if you want to eat here!  Don't do it!"}
{"text":"My guy had his Christmas party here. We had the dining room exclusively to us. We were served buffet style. With salad, (ranch or italian)  chicken tenders, and chicken wings (with hot sauce available) spaghetti, chicken Parmesan , and toast.  I thought the food was fair..It was decent. The chicken was cooked well..Tender and juicy. There just wasn't any WOW factor to any of it.  The service staff was nice and attentive. However, I just think that their drinks are slightly overpriced. I ordered a margarita, which was VERY strong, and my guy ordered a beer. Some how, these two drinks came out to $11.50"}
{"text":"I eat here ALOT. This is very close to my work place and always our go to lunch. We have been coming in 2-3 times per week over last 3 or 4 years. The food is always good and the service is always quick and friendly.  I think i have tried damn near everything on the menu and have never been dissapointed. The only gripe I would have is that the menu never changes and even though they do always offer daily specials they arent for me.  In the last 100 visits only once was our usual table occupied. We feel very comfortable here and always getting the same table is a part of that.  If you are in the area I would recommend tryin it out!"}
{"text":"I live very close to TCL and also work down the street so this was beginning to be my new hang out spot, I loved how welcoming it was. WAS being the key word here.  Just last night I was here with a friend having a few drinks and about a week ago I was here again eating and playing video poker. Anyway, today when I decided to stop in on my lunch. (Mind you, there are only about 4 customers as it is lunch time on a week day.) I was there about twenty minutes and had not been acknowledged. As I am getting ready to leave, I am approached by a server who says \"YOU GONNA ORDER ANYTHING OR NOT?\" I said \"actually I was just about to leave.\" My point is, how does this place expect to keep it's doors open when the staff behaves this way? I have served and understand how frustrating it can be and maybe she was having a bad day. However, I would never approach someone in that way. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"l got the Town bacon burger, with fries, and it was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Very nice people. We haven't tried there food yet but there drinks are yummy and they make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Came to check out the annual chili cook off. Amazing time. Chili, drinks, gambling, raffle tickets. Great seeing all the bartenders including Kristina and Donald!  Always a fun time."}
{"text":"I love their drinks!!!!!! I mean I'm hooked haha. Love this place the food is great and drinks are reasonable. My husband and I love to go there during the weekdays so they are not crazy busy!  This is a very chill place to hang out with your friends :)"}
{"text":"It's okay. Very smoky when you walk in, you can either sit at a booth, bar, or round tables and there's a separate non smoking dining room as well. We came here for lunch and despite there only being 2-3 other people in the bar the service was extremely slow. It took us an hour and a half to finish our meal. The beers are large and cold though and for $5.50 that's not a bad deal. I had the chicken Caesar wrap with french fries. It's what you would expect from a Caesar wrap for the most part except the chicken pieces weren't strips they were more like nuggets which was better actually. The fries are probably the best thing here, they're battered and crispy. Decent option for the area but don't expect to make a quick lunch if you're on a time crunch."}
{"text":"What a dump. Sat in the booth and something caused a black stain on my shirt. No one seemed to care.  Food was awful Service bad.   Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both sandwiches have been very good. It's just really dark on the non-smoking side (that takes a star) which makes it seem gloomy. Service has been decent and the menu is large and varied.  I'll be back a third time ;)"}
{"text":"I have recently started a new job in North Las Vegas and have been to Town Center Lounge II a few times now.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The bartender already knows what I drink and I've been in there a few times! The machines are alright- nothing spectacular, but I imagine you would have to commit $100 or more to really know what they are like.  Their Caveman keno pays really well, though.   The food is average- nothing spectacular...just your standard bar food and burgers.   If you are in the neighborhood, this is a nice cool place to escape the heat for a few drinks."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of bars. Most bars don't even make me pay, whether I know the owner or the bartender and family works there, but regardless of the option to get free alcohol and food, I still choose town center almost any night of the week. The food is great, they have the best French dip I have ever had. The atmosphere is laid back. But the main reason I choose this bar over all the others is the bartender named Rob who works the graveyard shift. He is friendly and welcoming, I have witnessed first hand that he can make anyone feel like family in this place. And he can make a mean whiskey sour. This bar, with this bartender, is the place to be."}
{"text":"the food is great.prices are reasonable and the server was friendly and professional.i tell everybody at work about this place.since it's open 24 hours i can go anytime.keep up the great work chivo,rocky and cameron you guys really know how to cook.christina,brandy and karen are the best bartenders in las vegas"}
{"text":"I had the Ultimate Chicken sandwich without bacon... Good service, good food (small portions) .  Everything that was just ok. The place is a little run down and looks like the current management team doesn't care to keep the place up.   It was windy outside, so I could hear the breeze blowing through a completely sealed window... I was OCD and about to go to home depot for some silicon!"}
{"text":"Went here several times on a short trip to Vegas to visit my dad for Thanksgiving.   The two bartenders we met here -- Karen and Robert -- are the type of naturally friendly and attentive people that you just don't encounter frequently enough in the service industry. They make this place what it is.  My wife is what you might call a mashed potato aficionado, and she loves the mashed potatoes here. She also enjoys the little wooden trays that fit over the bar so you can still eat and play a machine, if you so desire.  Speaking of the machines, they let us play for a decent amount of time on our first couple of visits (and even win a little on our second visit), but then they turned nasty on our third visit -- even the Harry Potter pinball machine chewed me up and spit me out that day!   So, play the machines at your own peril, but either way, you will enjoy the friendly atmosphere, and good food!"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend and we needed a spot to hang out while we waited for the rest of the crew to make it in town. She lives right down the street, so this place was perfect. We liked it so much we came in twice in two days. We all wanted drinks, a few wanted to gamble & by the end of the evening, we all needed food. Cheap drinks (cheap by CA standards anyway), friendly service and our food came out quickly. $20 buy in for the game machine and you drink free as you play, this saved us a TON of money lol!! Since my friend lives right down the block, she'll be spending a lot more time her. Til next time!!"}
{"text":"A great spot for ultra-casual, general dining. It's simply a bar/dining room in Vegas... and that's not a bad thing. It's very much the neighborhood spot; you see a lot of the same faces and that's quite pleasant.  The staff is friendly and usually very fast. They pay attention, they get to know you and what you like, and they let me change the channel when I want to watch sports. :)  The bar is large and has different seating areas apart from the bar itself: you can sit in the booths along the wall or in two different table areas and still have access to everything. They also offer some pool tables along the back wall. Great for sports and events, though it can be quite loud and hard to have a conversation.   The food is good. Not amazing, but solidly good. From breakfast to salads to the \"typical\" bar/appetizer menu to a tasty picatta, they serve you a decent meal with a smile. The chicken wings are a step above good and definitely a must-have late night or while watching the game with friends.  An inexpensive but ultimately drinkable wine list and crisp salads make this an easy choice for lunch with friends or coworkers.   The full menu is available in the bar, and the full bar is available in the dining room. That's always a good thing.  There's also a meeting room/private dining room if you need it. I have studied in there to avoid the noise in the dining room but still be able to enjoy my dinner."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would... This goes out to the future or current patrons that go into this restaurant... Beware of Yanelli- either she doesn't know how to do basic math or she is a thief. So make sure to count your change if you are unfortunate enough to have her serve you.  Our bill in the restaurant was $27 plus we had a draft beer for $4.50 (which we had ordered in the restaurant). Yanelli handed us both receipts and we gave her a $50 bill. She took about 10 minutes to come back with change and handed me $12 without the receipt and started to walk away. I asked her for the receipt so I knew what to tip her off of, plus I was pretty sure the bill didn't cost that much. She lied and said she didn't have the receipt... She said she threw it away. I say that's a lie because I told her I needed the receipt and she rolled her eyes, pulled out her server book and pulled the receipt out of it and handed it to me so I could see. She clearly wanted the receipt back and was standing next to me, so I pulled out my calculator and did the math 3 times just to be sure I wasn't going crazy. I did it in front of her and showed her I was missing $6. She immediately said \"the bar is different from the restaurant\", which is fine... I get that... But we never set foot in the bar or ordered anything from a bartender. Our entire experience was with her. So I told her either way it wouldn't make sense because $4.50 + $27 is $31.50, in which she shorted us $6.50. She then continued to be condescending and called me \"sweety\" told me I was wrong and tossed 3 more dollars on the table and proceeded to walk away. I told her she still owed me $3. And she argued a bit more so I asked for her manager. She told me NO. And gave me the extra $3 back. Kept calling me sweety and told me I was wrong again. Even though I showed her the math at least 3 more times. She never got the manager, but before she walked away from me and the unsolved issue for the 4th time, I managed to tell her how rude she was and she shouldn't argue with guests.  I tried calling management today... The person working there couldn't tell me what day a manager would be in... Hence the long Yelp review. I've been in the food and beverage industry for 10 years and I've never seen anything like what I had seen last night from Yanelli. By far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had... And I'm pretty sure she was trying to steal and that is why she never wanted to give me my receipt originally or apologize for her obvious mistake. That or she's quite uneducated."}
