{"text":"went here with a group of 4 on a travelzoo voucher.  We all really enjoyed it.  There was a jazz band playing the whole night (Saturday).  The service was attentive. Food was amazing!  We had charcuterie, shrimp, calamari and the gnocchi for apps.  They were all delicious.  i had sea bass for my main.  It was served with a tomato saffron sauce.  Yum!    The cocktails were also quite good (and strong). This restaurant is a bit out of place in Greektown but definitely worth a try.  It's a huge space.  Hopefully enough people will try it to keep it in business."}
{"text":"Simply amazed at how 417 has transformed this space on the Danforth. Everything is in the details. From the menu, to the decor to the staff. there was thought put into the overall experience. It was an amazing first dinner and a definite value for your dollar. We'll be back with more visits.   The lamb chops and the beef ravioli are my favorites. Tried the ahi tuna and salmon ceviche......Simple flavours done right.  The crunchy texture of the marcona almonds along with the avocado crema makes this app a winner.   Professional and attentive staff"}
{"text":"This is one of the few times I've been to the Danforth and not had Greek food!  I was tempted to abandon trying 417 by the smell of souvalaki. Mmm... But I was curious about this new hip lounge near Chester station.  This place is fairly new and much trendier and hip than it's neighbors.   The size of this place is about the same size of three restaurants.  It's a massive space for this neighborhood.  White modern decor, house tunes, a fake fire place, giant bamboo rods, it's a bit of that King West feel on the Danforth.    We were seated on their small patio which is perfect for people watching.  The service here was quite impressive.  Our water glasses were never empty and the servers came by frequently and were very friendly.  The menu isn't huge and 9 out 0f 10 mains have meat (in case you are vegetarian).  The selection of appetizers isn't bad though ranging from watermelon salads, calamari, steak or salmon tartar.  The steak tatare with an over-easy egg ($13) was delicious! It could have used some more pepper, but they had just the right amount of Dijon for zing.  The crispy little capers were a fun challenge to scoop up.  The servers will bring you more bread if you want with a side of  bean paste.  My pappardalle with sausage ($17) was alright, but I can't say it was stand out.  Size-wise, the portion was perfect and the pasta was chewy and springy. However, I found the sauce a bit lacking. But also, it's served with a Porcini broth and I usually like creamier mushroom sauces with pappardalle.  The cocktails were surprisingly strong and tasty. I'd stop in for cocktails again! The drink named the 417 had hints of rose, mostly lime... I'm not even sure what kind of booze was in it.  But it was good!   This is the type of place you'd go to before going to a club (if there were clubs around).  Maybe it's a happening lounge? We went on Saturday night for dinner but it was pretty quiet early evening. But maybe we should have hung around for another hour... but Dolce gelato is across the street!"}
{"text":"This place has received a much needed make over. I used to visit this place when it was still called Myth. Myth was horrible, but 417 has just turned this place right around. While Myth was a poor excuse for a lounge, 417 is just the bomb dot com.  I was here on Sunday night which has now become Sundaay @ 417 (every other Sunday). They play hip hop, reggae, and R&B (most of it is old school, which I love).   When I walked up to the bar, I expected to order my standard SoCo lime because I didn't really have high expectations for their brew selection, but I was shocked to find 22 different brews from LOCAL micro breweries. FOR REAL?! For real. I came across Great Lakes about a month back and fell in love with their orange peel ale, so I was very happy to find it on tap. The only thing that I did have against this place was the bartender. I watched her pour my beer from the tap, and it seemed like she couldn't pour to save her life. If you're going to feature 22 different local micro-breweries, at least have the personnel that can speak to these brews and actually be able to pour them. The head on my glass was huge and she had some weird technique to pouring  that definitely did not seem right.   I haven't tried the food, but I've heard great things, so it might be my next dinner spot as well. Anyways, if you're on the Danforth and you're looking for a great selection on tap- this is your place."}
{"text":"After a long walk along the Danforth our group of three was courted by the sangria special. We just wanted a few drinks but the lure of the poutine pizza was too intriguing.  We were not disappointed the poutine pizza came out like an artist's masterpiece - every ingredient delicately placed, not overpowering, and delicious.  Well done!   We sat on the patio and it was great."}
{"text":"We came for the $5 sangria pitchers and stayed for the poutine pizza. Not sure which was more delicious... The drinks, the food or our waiter. This was a great place to rest our feet after a long stroll along the Danforth - good people watching from our patio seating. We went early - looks like this place turns into a nightclub/lounge with DJ in evenings.  Quick update: I think this place might be closed?! Or under renovation? Walked by recently (but was in a rush) and couldn't really tell. There were covers on the windows though :("}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife and I have been 4 times now. Each visit I have tried a new appetizer and entree and have been very pleased with everything. Red and White wine on tap (thats right) at $1 an oz is a great deal too.   I highly recommend this place for a great dinner on the Danforth, especially if you don't feel like greek!"}
{"text":"really impressed by this place.  the decor stands out from other danforth alternatives. The service was also a standout.   I would recommend the white truffle gnocchi with bacons and green peas!!  enjoy!"}
