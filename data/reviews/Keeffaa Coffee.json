{"text":"The minute my friend and I stepped inside Elsabet, Keeffaa's owner and chef, took complete care of us. We felt right at home. We ordered what she recommended and it was by far one of the best meals I've ever had. Completely vegetarian, hearty, packed with delicious flavor and texture. Between the food, service, hospitality and ambiance, Elsabet's craft is unparalleled. Whenever I'm back in Toronto I know exactly where I'm headed."}
{"text":"An all around amazing experience. The owner made me an iced tea from scratch, despite the fact that it was not on the menu; and to top it off, it was the best iced tea I had ever had, and the person who was with me also tried it and said the same. The food was just as good. It was fresh and delicious, and clearly cooked with pure love."}
{"text":"Delightful little cafe on a randomly gentrifying stretch of Queen East. Like the other reviewers said, the coffee is divine - bitter, thick and heady. The ambiance here too is spot on - quaint tables and chairs, striking paintings, thick sunlight coming through the front windows, Billie Holiday on the stereo. There is also a rustic back patio that a lot of people seemed to drop by for. It's a pretty relaxed and casual atmosphere thanks to the friendly owner. This place would get full stars just on the cafe and I would return for its coffee alone.

Ordered the vegetarian (vegan) platter for two - possibly the only thing on it that was memorable was the ful (fava beans and lentils) - the beets, cabbage+carrots, and salad were bland, cold and mostly ignored by my friend and I. It was my friend's first time trying Ethiopian food and it was a shame that the meal was completely unimpressive. The prices were reasonable though. 

And maybe I'm old-fashioned but I would really appreciate a menu and some prices. Querying an overly-enthusiastic and peppy owner about everything she could possibly make, with several options and substitutions, and having her repeat everything for us was slightly annoying. 

Oh, and the restrooms are downright scary."}
{"text":"Awesome Ethiopian brunch.  Seriously, go--the bean platter is heavenly, with sour cream, tomatoes, and buttery eggs served with a baguette for scooping.  I shared with a friend and it was just the right size.  We also ordered the spicy hot chocolate, made with non-dairy milk (I think it was hemp, but I can't remember), and that was a delight.  The server misunderstood and brought an extra one, but I was more than happy to finish it off.

The back patio is eclectically decorated and very peaceful.  It would be easy to spend a couple of hours out here on a sunny day, lingering over breakfast and passing sections of the newspaper back and forth over the table."}
{"text":"Ethiopian FOOD Is Love ! My first time tasting Ethiopian cuisine, best way to describe it,,, it reminds me of indian food , colorful, flavourful but not as starchy and heavy, it's a nice alternative... wish this place was closer to home.. had a great time here, hope to come back soon. Also the place is very artsy and cool, chill vibes, hospitable and friendly owner."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place where the owner remembers you and asks you about your life, this is the place. My husband and I are happy to trust her to make us a delicious meal, lunch or dinner, no menu required. Vegan or vegetarian are the choices- just sit down, relax, and let her make you something yummy."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one for reviewing restaurants, but for Keeffaa I'm making an exception. The service here was so amazing, the owner so kind, and the food so delicious that it would be an insult for me not to recommend this place to everyone I can.

My friends and I went to this shop a few days ago, after a hectic day of the TTC being shitty and the weather shittier. We were greeted warmly in the small, mostly empty space and sat at one of the old tables. The owner immediately brought us hot cinnamon tea (delicious!) and began making us a plate of the most amazing food. We stuffed ourselves on a veggie platter, which was one of the most amazing and filling meals I've ever had the pleasure of eating - the spices were spot-on and it was so fresh - and she kept coming over to make sure everything was alright and giving us more injera. The price for all three of us together, for a huge amount of food (we had a lot of leftovers to take home with more complimentary injera) and tea before and after the meal, was only around $45!

But even more amazing than the food was what happened afterwards. When I got home, I realized that I left my phone at the shop and, since I lived an hour away, I didn't have the chance to go back for it. Since it was after closing hours, I went to her facebook page and left her a message. She messaged me back saying that she found it and was keeping it for me and, when I went there today to pick it up, she gave me great free coffee and biscotti for the road!

This place is truly a gem, and one of the best places I've ever been to. If you're in the area, I highly encourage you to come here for great food and conversation, and to meet the kindest, most talented woman with the best drinks in Toronto!"}
{"text":"SERVICE: Friendly, enthusiastic owner with a clear passion & gift for preparing food. Right off the bat she enquired about all dietary restrictions.
DECOR: Beautiful, comfortable, inviting, no A/C but a nice cross breeze and completely gorgeous back patio!
FOOD: I wasn't sure what to order on my first visit, so the owner prepared a delicious combo with raw carrots, beets, kale, steamed lentils & fava beans seasoned with jalapeno goat cheese. She also whipped up an organic iced coffee with coconut milk, cocoa and cayenne -- a refreshing combination on such a hot day!

To the owner: I meant to ask your name, just wanted to say THANK YOU!!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food, and this is the best I've ever had!! Don't be afraid if you are an omnivore - the food is amazing, and you will be more than satisfied! The chef truly has a bit of magic under her fingers!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a coffee. Was hot and delicious and tasted fresh and exotic. My son had some cookies. He described them as 'pure awesomeness'."}
{"text":"We went here based on other yelp reviews and they were dead on. Everything is warm and authentic. The proprietor is a natural open spirit who exudes hospitality. There isn't really a proper menu, she just told us what she was preparing that day and we said what we would like. She then went and made it all from scratch right then starting with the incredibly rejuvenating ginger tea. (Note: when I asked her what was in it she said it changes on her whim and she shared some variations which included cayenne! So if you are sensitive to certain spices be sure to ask what the days recipe is.) 

The main dish was incredibly fresh and flavorful. Injera was delicious and 100% teff flour so gluten free (my spouse is gf)! We couldn't believe we ate it all. She also brought us more injera when she saw we ran low. 

We took coconut milk mochas to go and they were rich and decadent as well, without being cloying or too sweet. 

I would recommend this place to anyone. I hope it succeeds for years to come."}
{"text":"I had the Spiced Lamb, Egg, Chickpea Salad, and Beets.

Delicious! This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and it was a fantastic experience. The lamb tasted so good I wished I had ordered a larger helping instead of eggs. The service here is also fantastic, one can tell a lot of joy goes into the preparation and serving of these meals. If you've never tried Ethiopian food before I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough on the rapidly gentrifying Queen East/Parliament stretch. I highly recommend getting the coconut latte - its actually made with real coconut cream! 

I also recommend the Lover's Ful for brunch if you're there with a friend. The vegetarian platter with injera is also a good choice - its vegan and the portions are generous.

Be sure to chat with the owner! She's the sweetest. The artwork on the walls are hers, so check them out!

Note: Do not order a chai latte when you come here. Chai lattes are not Ethiopian coffee. Yes, I'm talking to you, random dude who demanded a chai latte when I was brunching the other day."}
{"text":"It's worth coming here just for the coffee. This is the best coffee I've had in Toronto, period. 

It's also a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere, so the sheer excellence of the food may be unexpected. After you talk with the owner for a while, you'll learn she does everything with an understated passion to provide the very best for her customers. She teaches vegetarian cooking classes and is writing a cookbook. This is a tiny Toronto gem, not to be missed."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, great value for the price, and great quality of food.

I took m'lady to this venue last Saturday, and it was so good, that we went there again for lunch the following Monday, when we were passing through town.

We were told that no meat is served at this venue anymore, as of 2 months ago, so if you're checking the website of the venue, you might be a tad misled. Also, I asked about the coconut latte, which is advertised on the venue's window, and I was told that that's no longer available. So one loss of star for the outdated communication.

However the server is very social, ensuring that all of the guests and engaged, and doing whatever she can by catering to them.

Based on the 2 times I was there, the meal seemed to cost the same price even though we ordered different dishes, so it appears to be prix-fixe (about $18 per person, taxes in).

The food is very fresh and quite tasty. It's also not too heavy, and not too light, but just right. The tea that she makes is to die for: amazing quality.

We asked for some tea to go, and ended up getting it in glass cups, but we didn't think of that as a big deal. We couldn't finish our last dish, so she packed it for us \"to go\" in cups, which I found a tad odd, but still nothing to die over :-)

All-in-all, my experience of this venue has been quite positive, and I'd definitely return there again soon."}
{"text":"Love the homey atmosphere and its lovely owner!
Food tastes amazing and the special ginger tea she serves is also excellent.
Tip: they close early at 7pm on weekdays."}
{"text":"I didn't know I liked Ethiopian breakfast but now I do.
Maybe there are prices? We just let the host cook us anything and serve us tea and coffee and we paid $15/pp at the end which felt very fair. Cash only. 

It just feels like you're in someone's special place. The lady who cooks and serves is super friendly.

She told us every Friday @ 5pm she does a buffet-style/family style dinner. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place makes me so happy. Elsabet is such a warm and caring personality, that walking in the door I felt like family. Her passionate and loving spirit is clear in the delicious food she cooks. She made me, my wife and kids the most delicious fresh beet dish we've ever tried (actually the only cooked beet dish we've ever tried). This was accompanied by an exceptional egg dish (as we arrived at 11:30, so this was like an Ethiopian brunch) that my kids loved, lentils, and spinach. Coupled with injera and a delicious strong coffee, my heart and stomach were singing. In summary, I've found a new favorite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Elsabet: The owner, the artist and the woman who makes this place so amazing!

I called before I went asking for a reservation and was told they don't do reservations . We reach the place and the minute I walk through the door, I know I'm going to like this place.

With a huge smile and a big welcome, we are seated in the cute little corner next to the window. We get water in mason jars and I notice that everyone has a different glass/cup/plate/chair etc. Its like someone shopped from thrift stores and its amazing! The place exudes warmth. There are paintings done by Elsabet hanging on the walls and a small menu written on chalkboard wall. She does not have printed menus and will explain everything verbally. She will say it with such passion that you will want to order everything. We started with our drinks, a latte with almond and coconut milk and Ethiopian tea. The latte was amazing as my husband said but my tea was better. It was black, sweet and spiced with cinnamon, star anise and some more spices. It was absolutely the best and the size of the cups was huge!

Then arrived our lamb and veggie platter which included a cold lentil salad, a beetroot salad, kale and spinach dish followed by another lentil dish with 17 spices! Every single dish was amazing but my favourite was the lamb. The spices were so well balanced and new to my tastebuds (and I have had a lot of Ethiopian food). The quantity was great and we even had some leftover (none of the beetroot salad cause my husband wiped it clean!). 

In between our meal we saw some of the customers helping Elsabet clear a table and just going up and talking to her while she prepared the food. Customers moved chairs around and walked up and down the restaurant like it was a friends place. That is exactly the kind of atmosphere that Elsabet wants to have and she does it well. She is extremely social with customers and will answer any questions you have without making you feel rushed. There is no one but her running the place and yet you will never feel overlooked. She is always smiling and very approachable!

The vibe of the place is that of a home, like we are all long lost friends, so if you are the type of person who likes a waiter at your beck and call and aren't very social, you might not enjoy the place. The food too is a testament to that, she makes concoctions for drinks based on what she feels like for the day. She will have no qualms about making changes to a dish if thats what you want, it's this level of service that will make you want to return.

The entire experience is fun and relaxing, we will definitely be going back :)

PS: Our bill came up the $33! Amazing price for such good food!"}
{"text":"Took veggie platter for take out on a Saturday. Probably wasn't the right day to order. The Injera came with just 4 dishes out of which one was an egg preparation. Just one lentil dish and two salad type dishes. Good value for money considering the portion size which is huge. Amazing spiced Coconut latte !!!"}
{"text":"If you want a warm welcome, fantastic food and coffee this is the place to come. The food is always made fresh and although it means the menu is different each visit I've never been disappointed. They close on weekdays by 7 so if you're looking for dinner get there early."}
{"text":"My advice:
Free up your upcoming weekend and ask for the \"meal of the day\", aka \"what do you recommend?\". 

You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Organic drinks and Ethiopian food.  I sampled their daily juice (different every day) and had an almond latte. 

The owner is the nicest, warmest lady you will ever meet. She is very enthusiastic about her drinks and will chide you into adding something she thinks you will enjoy.  She added oats and flax to mine, and I really enjoyed it.

The back patio is a tiny oasis in the city, well shaded but with tables and comfy chairs if you want to hang out or get some work done."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, great coffee.   I had scrambled eggs with beets, sweet potato, onion topped with spiced yougurt, and some kind of fried flat bread.  Flat bread was ok, but eggs made my day, fantastic with variety of spice flavours coming through.  Finished with Ethiopiana spiced coffee!  Very happy and positive service!"}
{"text":"Such a gem! Fresh tasty Ethiopian food! We ordered a vegetarian platter for 2, and it was a good amount of food with lots of injera. The food was colourful, and they steam their lentils, etc. so less greasy than a lot of other Ethiopian food I have had in the past. 

The owner is so friendly and sweet. She has a beautiful back patio where you can eat too. Definitely want to come back and try the breakfast one sunny morning. 

Highly recommend Keeffaa!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I just can't stop thinking about the food I had here -- it was amazing, one of the best meals I've ever had in Toronto.

Keefaa is tucked away on a gritty stretch of Queen and doesn't look like much from the outside. But once you get inside and meet the owner, you will be charmed. This is unlike any restaurant experience you're likely to have in Toronto: there is no set menu, no servers, and no kitchen staff. There's just one lovely lady with a passion for cooking and art, and she will welcome you like a guest in her own home.

Be warned that eating at Keeffaa is a meditative experience. If you're in a hurry, this may not be the place for you, though it is possible to call ahead with your order if time is tight.

The food is something else. I've eaten my share of Ethiopian food, but there is something special about the food here. I'm still dreaming of it, weeks later. The veggie platter may just be the most delicious vegan meal in the city. The tea is also incredible. On our last visit, the owner had returned from a trip to Ethiopia and the tea was spiced with genuine Ethiopian spices.

Bottom line: this may just be my favourite restaurant in Toronto. I am in love with this place and you will be too."}
{"text":"Just sit, relax and enjoy. she will ask you what you don't like and then she will cook whatever she thinks fits you, go with an open mind and you will enjoy a lot. 
The food is so testy, fresh and great, the price is so good and she, the owner, is just great. 

Full experience, totally recommendable."}
{"text":"The woman who owns this place is one of the nicest, sweetest people I've meet in a long time. She's also a painter. But BOY CAN SHE COOK.  We wandered in for lunch and ordered an assortment of vegetarian dishes.  All of them had individualized spices and were presented in a beautiful manner.  Now, normally, I'm not a huge fan of the spongy bread you get at most Ethiopian restaurants, but the bread here was much lighter and had a much better flavor.  A true gem of a restaurant.  You must try this wonderful little place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. From the moment I walked in the owner greeted me with a smile and such great energy! She is so personable and her cooking is to die for! I got the vegetarian platter and she also made me a ginger, mint, and lime tea. I am telling EVERYONE I know about this restaurant. Truly the best food I've had during my trip in Toronto. She makes different food every day so the menu isn't accurate but you can give her a vague idea of what you want to eat and she nails it! 

And funnily enough the owner asked how I found this place and I told her about her yelp reviews being so spectacular and she had no idea! Such positive vibes and beautiful energy I could literally stay here all day!"}
{"text":"Loved this little spot. Went out of the way to get here based on Yelp reviews and was very happy with the experience. Don't ask for silverware though, it offends the owner!"}
{"text":"Wow

I was so impressed with this place!

From the authenticity of the food to the personality of the owner.

We ordered an assortment of veggie dishes.
Every dish was better than the other.

The food is light and seems really healthy.

To top it all, the owner spoiled us with a ginger tea that she made in-house. One word- Wow!!!

A different experience that will pleasantly surprise you."}
{"text":"If I had to choose one restaurant for anyone to visit in Toronto, it would be this one.

Keeffaa is a smallish place, suited for intimate or small groups of people (we've always done four.) The owner is a wonderful woman with loads of personality and her presence seems to show up even in the food ... all we are asked is if we'd like meat in our dinner or to have it vegetarian, and I am pretty sure she decides on the meal as she goes along. And there's something about the food, some flavour, I am not sure, that makes it unique and amazing. I have never tasted anything like that food, and I always walk out of the restaurant extremely happy.

This place's tea and coffee is different every time I go in, but it's some of the best coffee and (especially) tea I've ever had alongside Ethiopian. The tea is something I would come for just for itself.

Because the owner makes all of the food when you show up, please consider calling ahead of time and letting the restaurant know how many people are showing up. Or show up, enjoy a nice pre-dinner conversation and soak in the ambience of the place :)"}
{"text":"I had to create a Yelp account because this restaurant was so excellent and Toronto needs to know about it.

Instructions:
Go to this restaurant. 
Tell the lovely lady behind the counter that you are hungry and you would like to eat anything she wants to make.
If she suggests something, say yes. It doesn't matter if you don't understand what it is. Say yes.
If she offers you some wondrous concoction of ginger and lemon and honey, say yes. 
If, at the end of your meal, she offers you some strange brew that is part coffee and part hot chocolate and part something completely different, say yes.
If she looks worried about whether you've had enough, whether you're having a good time, whether she succeeded in making you feel at home, say yes.
When the meal is done, tip her handsomely because she will try to give you the food for far less than it's worth.
When all is said and done, rejoice, for you have just eaten the best Ethiopian food in Toronto.

If you need food that is gluten-free or halal, she's got you covered, so let her know. 
If you're happy to try anything and are open to suggestions from a very kind and experienced chef, this restaurant is for you. 

If you're picky about what you eat, need to know everything that goes into a meal, or need the control of choosing from a detailed menu, move on. This restaurant is not for you."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to try Ethiopian food for our first time. When we first got to the restaurant, we noticed that there was no set menu. The restaurant was incredibly small and owner was the only person there serving us the food. 

The owner was very nice, and immediately introduced us to the different kinds of teas she offered and their origins. We were first served Injera (sourdough flatbread, with a spongy texture), followed by a veggie platter which was more than enough for the 4 of us. It was a unique mix of veggies (served hot and cold) and very well seasoned. We were told to wrap the injera around the veggies and eat with our hands. 

I was a little disappointed that there was no meat being served on that day, but trying Ethiopian food was definitely a great experience. The owner is great, and took her time to explain to us all the ingredients."}
{"text":"I'd just landed in Toronto a few hours before, and some Yelp research pointed me toward Keeffaa. I'm glad it did. Everything I'd read was true. It's indeed a small, no frills place, but there is nice art hanging on the walls (they were preparing for an art show), and I was completely prepared to hang out while the absolutely delightful, warm owner made food for me. We chatted and I drank some ginger-mint-lime tea while she made food. I have to admit I had a moment of doubt as it was all coming together--would it be enough food and enough different items? But then it arrived. There was egg, shiro, several types of lentils (both hot and cold) and chickpeas, all served with injera, the spongy Ethiopian bread that I'd liken to a sour pancake. And it was delicious--bursting with flavor--even more so because it was clearly made with great love. And while she was cooking and later while I was eating, various folks from the neighborhood and some of the artists would come in to talk or pick up food or to talk about the show. All in all, it's just a great vibe, with great food served by a lovely human being. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"highly over rated hole in the wall for the vegan vegetarian cohort.  

If you want Ethiopian in Toronto don't go there."}
{"text":"This joint is scrumptious, reasonably priced, and quite unique. The artist who runs it, Elizabeth I think her name is, is a sweet and passionate soul who makes terrific food. Early closing time, but scrumptious food for great prices.

She does gorgeous art with ash & coffee (!) and tasty Ethiopian!"}
{"text":"The owner is extremely pleasant and goes to great lengths to ensure the contentment of her guests. Excellent food, excellent service, quaint atmosphere. A real gem."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Thursday. The owner was so kind and incredible, we sat down with no clue of what to order and apparently our befuddlement was evident. The next thing we knew we were being served delicious cinnamon tea and she said \"don't worry I'll put something together for you\".

Later we were presented with a giant plate of beautiful rainbow vegetables that had an assortment of different flavors and spices. They were all delicious and we ended the meal with some coffee, tea and these special Ethiopian crisps.

We didn't even know what the prices were but it came to around $15 a person which is super good for the quality of food and service we received!

Definitely coming back with some work colleagues in the near future!"}
{"text":"Revisited after 3 months. Great meal. Owner remembered by food preferences and asked about my colleague from prior visit. Now accepts credit cards. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food and I rarely eat it. It's a shame, I know, but I hope that I have rectified the situation by starting the ball rolling with future visits to this lovely place. 

What is said about the owner/cook/server is true: she is a beautiful human being. She has amazing cooking skills and she just radiates joy. 

The food is delicious. I ordered the veggie platter for one and I ate everything single piece of food on the plate. How could I leave anything behind? It would have been sacrilege of me to do so. And the price? Well, for someone on a budget, the price is perfect. 

Of course I want to return! Not just because their brunch sounds like heaven or because they serve a coconut latte. I also love the smell of the place. The mixture of spices and coffee beans roasting on the stove. To me, it's a comforting feeling and a sense of warmth. Very few places can achieve that."}
{"text":"I'm sure many can understand when I say that I miss Elsa so much.
Her passion for food and for people radiated throughout this humble and beautiful cafe/restaurant and made such an impact on everyone who has walked through her door. I refuse to drink coffee that hasn't been hand-roasted by her, and can't seem to find the desire to eat Ethiopian food because it's just not the same without Elsa. It wasn't just food, it was art. It was her on a plate.
She is a woman, a mother, and an artist who carries herself like a Queen and uplifts others like a dear friend. I pray that she will open a new restaurant soon.
Her menu was never the same, and the flavors were always dynamite. I would see my friends and familiar faces often for somehow we would all show up at the same time even if we hadn't discussed meeting up or planning on seeing each other. It was a soothing sanctuary, a creative space, and a place filled with love, great coffee and wonderfully filling food.
If Elsa ever revives Keeffaa again, GO."}
{"text":"One of the best spots for Ethiopian food in the city.   Consistently great food, and usually a few interesting components you don't find elsewhere (i.e sweet potato, beets).   Friendly & engaging owner/chef."}
{"text":"If I could give it even more stars, I would - the four of us loved the 

1) owner, cook, server and artist who created our food and drinks - go there just for her if nothing else; 
2) Ginger tea - who knew you could love liquid ginger! It cleared up my sinuses :) And it was AMAZING!
3) Food - vegitarian platter for four and lots of injara! We were all filled up and licked the plate (and our fingers)!
4) Coconut latte - YUMMY - I died and went to coffee heaven! 
5) The price - super inexpensive and an amazing bargain! 

Dont wait - gogogogogogogogogo!!!!! And tip your server - she deserves it so much! 

the room is not big - we had the biggest table and that could fit 6 people."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the coffee was even better. It was one of the best coffees I have ever had. If youre in the area this place is a must go. Can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. I love living in corktown but when it comes to good food it is a desert(don't even bring up the distillery ones I can't even). I am so glad to find this Restro on queen and Parliament where I could walk up easily from king and the food is just great. Flavorful, nutritious, creative. Always love Ethiopian food. And the owner is so nice. She talkes to customers and make them feel special. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Just from speaking with the owner, you could tell she was very passionate about food - \"Ethiopian cuisine is a story of [her] ancestors.\" At that moment, I knew this will be an unforgettable experience! 

As she prepared each dish, she explained to me the different ingredients used and the flavors to expect. The food was delicious and unique. If you are ever in the mood to try something new, this is the place to go! 

Who needs to fly to Ethiopia when you can come here!"}
{"text":"Delicious food made fresh in a charming little restaurant by a talented and friendly cook!  If you like Ethiopian food, this is a wonderful place.  Gluten free and dairy free available.  

I had the veggie plate and Ethiopian tea.  It was excellent, well worth a trip off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Elsabet is running a lovely eclectic spot with amazing homecooker food. It's different every day with a veggie focus. She treats you like you're in her home, so genuine and kind. 

On top of this her cooking and tea is some of the best Ethiopian food I've ever had. Homemade injera, gluten free most days except Wednesday. I had the veggie platter with eggplant, lentils and a raw beet salad. Super flavourful and perfect amount of spices.

Elsabet cooks by herself for the entire place, every day is a different meal! Come here and support an amazing local place and local artist."}
{"text":"If you think you know amazing Ethiopian food you must try Elsabet's. There is no better. Mouth-wateringly flavourful yet nuanced, her meals are unbelievably tasty and filling.

I am someone who normally has water with a meal. To me, it isn't worth the money to order a drink. Not so here! I don't drink coffee, but I have been wowed every visit with different libations every time-each better than the last. The apple juice and ginger tea are favourites so far.

As if this wasn't enough, Elsabet herself will nourish your spirit. She is a wonderful to visit-she feeds both body and mind. You simply must go see her!"}
{"text":"We were looking for Ethiopian food and entered this place where the host was amazing. She has no menu, no fixed dishes and just started cooking for us. Her tea is amazing and her food was delicious. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Everything is legitimately homemade on the spot, including the coffee, which is roasted by hand. The owner, Elsabet, is extremely warm and more than happy to explain the intricacies behind each aspect of the meal she decides to prepare for you. It was an exceptionally nice experience for my friends and I who visited from the states."}
{"text":"I love this place - the food is made fresh, uses organic ingredients and the owner is the nicest woman. She is so welcoming and genuinely sweet. She'll remember your order from the last time you came in and is very accommodating of various dietary restrictions and food allergies. 

I recommend trying the veggie platter, which comes with various vegetable dishes (often beans, spinach, salad, cabbage and/or beets - though it often changes from day to day) and delicious injera. She will gladly make the Ethiopian veggie platter vegan if you ask. 

This is some of the best Ethiopian food I've had in Toronto, everything is perfectly spiced, lovingly homemade and so filling. 

Try the ginger tea and the hot chocolate (so good with coconut milk) and you won't be disappointed. 

There's a very cute patio in the back that's great in the summertime for catching up with a friend, or doing some work on your laptop. 

The prices are very reasonable (two can eat for $20 at lunch - including tax and tip) and the eclectic ambiance and hospitality are second to none. FYI, they take cash only but there's a TD bank directly across the street. 

This place really is a hidden Corktown gem - definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Usually, when I like a place, I recommend certain dishes for people to try. Here, EVERYTHING is amazing! Try it all!! Every time we come, we spend at least 3 to 4 hours, eating, sipping tea and coffee, eating more.

Coming to Keeffa is like going to an old friend's house. You're greeted with great warmth, served heavenly drinks and delicious home made food. You sit, you eat, you chat and then more drinks and food appear and then you eat and you chat some more and more food and drinks appear. 

Elsabeth, the owner, is a wonderful host, cook and talented artist. She makes pretty much everything herself, from scratch, she even roasts her own coffee. If I can give this place more than 5 stars, I would!

Free up your Saturday, go to Keeffaa, bring some friends, the more the merrier, experience a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony, enjoy some exciting food."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a hunch and was so happy i did. This place is kitchy, homey, and is run by the sweetest woman i have yet to meet. Food was incredible, made with love and passion, by the same woman who runs the place. Coffee is strong, menu is all vegetarian but apparently she adds eggs around breakfast time on the weekends, if she is feeling up to it. 

Wouldn't hesitate to return at the drop of a dime and driving by yesterday reminded me of how much fun I had eating here last. 

Highly reccomended"}
{"text":"Having not had Ethiopian food in many years, and not having especially fond memories of it, I decided to give it another go.  I just randomly came across this place via Yelp.  The restaurant is tiny, just a few tables and chairs to sit, the place is long and narrow.  We ordered the lentil soup, which was big and we shard, and the veggie platter.  The lentil soup was topped with a beet relish, and was the best lentil soup I have ever had.  The veggie platter came with 5 or 6 different things, plus the injera.  We ate every bite, the plate was clean.  To go we got a cup of delicious coffee, to which she added her own blend of cardamom, ginger, cocoa, and I don't know what, but it was a flavor explosion, very spicy!  I cannot wait to go back to this place, and yes, the owner is very sweet, and made you feel right at home."}
{"text":"A must try!!! This woman CAN COOK. Order everything. The meat, veggies and ginger tea. 

Added bonus: she is as fabulous and comforting as her food. 

Fine print: didn't love my beef tibbs but I only tried them white not red so I haven't lost faith!"}
