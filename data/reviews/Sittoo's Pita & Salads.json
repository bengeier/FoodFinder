{"text":"If your mom would know how to cook Arabic food it would taste like sittoos . Great place"}
{"text":"For years I got my Lebanese cuisine fix at Aladdins, I tried Sittoo's one day for lunch and have not gone back to Aladdins for 2 years. Sittoo's just does everything better-hummus, baba, schwarma, falafel are all delicious. As many others have mentioned, the staff here is much friendlier to boot!"}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago we saw a write up in a local newspaper for Sittoo's and it sounded good so we gave it a try. As we arrived it struck me that for a Saturday night the place wasn't very crowded. Of course the first thing that comes to your mind is \"boy I hope we're not making a mistake coming here, does everyone know something we don't.\" So right off the bat lets clear one thing up. We didn't make a mistake going to Sittoo's. Why this place wasn't more crowded on a Saturday evening will forever remain a mystery to me.
Everyone who worked there was extremely friendly. The menu choices were adequate. The prices were, I thought, unbelievingly reasonable. This place didn't have anything more expensive then $7.99 on the entire menu. I ended up ordering a lamb dish and my partner ordered a chicken dish. I can't pronounce the specific names attached to these dishes so I certainly couldn't spell them for this review either but I can say that both the lamb and chicken were well prepared. The portions were very adequate. They rice was done perfectly, as it usually is at a middle eastern restaurant, with a touch of sumac sprinkled over it, and the salad was fresh and with a light dressing.
As I said earlier, it's a mystery to me why this place wasn't more crowded. On our drive to Sittoo's we pass by a couple fast food places that are mobbed yet you can go here and get a meal for probably about the same price, served by a friendly staff, the food well prepared and obviously better for you then some mystery meat sandwich and fries and yet the place isn't that crowded. Go figure."}
{"text":"My favorite local place to eat.  I love that it is family owned.  But their food really is very fresh & delicious.  I have never dined in, I always take the food to go, but the staff is always very polite & nice.  Their hummus is the BEST hummus I have ever had.  And the best part is, you get a good deal of food for the money you pay.  You can't beat that; fresh food for a great price."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm a frequent customer and have primarily had a great experiences, with a few small blips here and there. The food is excellent and I've never had anything that wasn't delicious. The prices are extremely reasonable and the service is always fast. The staff is always friendly and courteous. My favorites are the vegetarian wraps (all of them!) and the falafel salad. Make sure to get a baklava combo with diamonds & lady fingers - it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I no longer patronize this establishment after I asked for a side a salad dressing and the clerk told me that they don't give sides of salad dressings because people may take it home and put it on their own salad. As long as I'm willing to pay for it, they shouldnt care if I'm going to take it home and drink it! Crazy thing is, before that, I would stop by after work damn near everyday. Petty things like that will make me not spend any of my money at an establishment."}
{"text":"love their tobuli  sandwiches and humas, grapeleaves were good, the service was great just recently i went there"}
{"text":"We love this place.  I'm vegetarian and everything I've tried is awesome.  The pita sandwich rolls are toasted!  And best of all, the pita that comes with the dips and appetizers is warm and fluffy.  The hot sauce is fantastic.  The ambiance is really casual, but nice, the beverages are self-serve, and even though you order at the counter, someone usually brings your tray to you."}
{"text":"I wish I could combine dishes from various Lebanese restaurants around the area to make a delicious mega-meal. Sittoo's would be featured. The bf and I went to Sittoo's on a Saturday afternoon. After we were seated, about 5 groups of people came in after us ordering a mix of dine-in and takeout. This place stays busy.
Atmosphere:
Much bigger than I thought, with plenty of tables and inviting atmosphere. Walk up to the counter, order your food, and they will bring it out to you. Bus your own tables.
Food:
We got a hummus appetizer, a falafel appetizer, I got a falafel salad and BF got Sittoo's platter. Nice sized portions, fresh ingredients. The hummus was smooth and seasoned with olive oil. Falafel got an A+. Crispy, tender yet chewy, fresh amazing falafel- the best I've ever had. My salad had more falafel, feta cheese, and assorted veggies. Garlic sauce was pungent and tasty. BF liked his meal, but didn't like that the chicken was pulled (i.e. shredded). 
Value:
We got a pretty decent amount of food for $30. 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 drinks. We took a box home. Not too shabby, I would return.

That being said, I still desired more. Which brings me to my Lebanese mega meal, of course. What would my cross-restaurant meal feature?
1. Falafel from Sittoo's
2. Garlic Labneh from La Kabob
3. Tabbouli from Aladdin's
4. Lebanese salad with gyro meat from La Kabob
5. Garlic sauce from Sittoo's"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, good service. I usually get the vegetarian platter or spinach pies. My normally picky little niece and nephew love the kibbe. I also enjoy the music here, which always makes me want to dance. Nice relaxed place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious cuisine!  The food is always fresh and of high quality. The staff and servers are always warm and pleasant. The garlic sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"Just tried this yesterday.  The lamb, falafel, tabouli were all great!"}
{"text":"Really like the place we had their appetizer plater, lab sandwich, lentil soup. The kids had chicken strips with rice, chicken is flavored and grilled. Place is clean and family friendly. Like Aladdin's but cheaper"}
{"text":"Update: great place, but food poisoning not so great. 

Amazing food, reasonable prices, great atmosphere, friendly staff! Food took about 10 minutes to come after it was ordered, which is a testament to its freshness, and they delivered it too the table. Shish kabob was cooked perfectly, just a little pink but not burned, juicy with great flavor. Shish tawook was perfectly cooked and seasoned, not chewy or too stringy. Rice pilaf was soft and delicious. My wife loved the baklava, but the kinafa was very chewy and unappetizing, and the cheese soon solidified into a solid chunk. Salad looked good, but I wasn't a fan of the dressing, must be an acquired taste. Pitas were soft and delicious, especially when dipped in the yummy white dressing. Staff was very helpful, as this was our first experience with Middle Eastern food. Building was very clean. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, and you got many choices here. It's marked as $$ here but honestly, it's really cheap. :)"}
{"text":"This westside jewel never fails to deliver.  Each dish is prepared to perfection, with a few surprises here and there.  While the middle eastern dishes each shine, I was shocked at how unique and remarkable the french fries were.  On 2 separate occasions we ordered the french fries and each time they were exactly the same- firm, crisp, golden fried and dusted with spices.  We keep coming back because Sittoo's is just better than everyone else."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and also gotten carry out, and both were great. Quick and friendly service, good prices, good falafel."}
{"text":"This restaurant is adorable, staff is always pleasant and food is fantastic. I would eat here everyday I could. Shish tawook salad is so light and refreshing. And they give plenty of pita with hummus. The sides of garlic and hot sauce are a perfect way to add a bit of extra zing to an dish"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service.  For years, I went to Aladdin's, and after trying Sittoo's, I haven't been back.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sittoo's is amazing food. I would say without a doubt the best hummus in the area. My favorite meals are anything chicken shwarma based (entree, sandwich, or hummus platter). The chicken is so flavorful and chargrilled perfectly. So many other great items on the menu too. Food is quick and staff is friendly. A rare five star place in town."}
{"text":"Very good food!!! Awesome hummos, a little on the pricy side for pop... 1.95 for a pop that you can't take out (hard plastic cups) but other than that it's an amazing place!!! Very clean."}
{"text":"Love LOVE love this place!!! Never a disappointment! The food is amazing and everything has excellent flavor! The salads are always fresh and the dressing is amazing! The lentil soup is always piping hot! The chicken and lamb shawarma with hummus is the best Ive had and the OMG falafel is to die for!!! I just wish the prices would go back to what they were when they first opened so I could go as much as I used to. Highly recommend going here!! :  )"}
{"text":"Yum. As the little sister of Aladdin's - Sittoos is just as tasty!!  The hummus from here is out of this world good, especially with a side of their hot sauce. The shishtawook is also delicious. Portion sizes are good and they have a decent prep time. This isn't fast food, you will wait a few minutes, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Even though mine was the only order, it took forever to get my food. The counter girl spent the entire twenty minutes of my wait texting on her phone. The self service \"hot\" mint tea was stale and room temperature. 

When my food was finally ready, it spent a good long time on the shelf waiting. I could see my lentil soup losing its steam and returning to the same room temperature my tea was at. But the counter was having fun chatting with some friends at the counter

I went to the counter to get my food and the counter girl told me with a condescending grin \"I'll bring it out to you.\" and i said with a smile \"I'd like take it now before it gets more cold.\" She rolled her eyes (at what a terrible customer i was) and sighed. \"I said I'll bring it out to you, SIR.\"

Well, she didn't.

I ended up leaving the restaurant with the food that i paid for still sitting on the shelf.  They have my money, i got no food.

This is how a bad employee ruins your business. Congratulations, I'll never return, not even to get the food that paid for."}
{"text":"Second time there and its as good as I remembered it to be. This is real Hummus. Get the hot sauce and dive in. I could bath in that stuff! My food was perfectly prepared and worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here in a week and I loooove it! It's far better in flavor and value than Aladdin's imho. It's very casual dining but the service is pretty quick and friendly. Their hummus is delish and super smooth & creamy. Their baba is also so good! The tabouli is perfectly fresh and sour. And their falafel are brown and crunchy on the outside and warm and smooth on the inside. Delish! Hot sauce and garlic sauce are free and they're both so good! The perfect condiment. I can't say enough good about this place!"}
{"text":"Really excellent food reasonably priced! Had a salad and spinach pie, both excellent. Since it was nice I sat outside but the interior was nicely appointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Came in on a Saturday for lunch. Daughter thought she would have to eat lamb. Not so. Had the Fattoush with chicken and garlic mayo. Very good. 

Also order a large Tabouli and a large Hummos with hot sauce. The Hummos was like pudding. Very very good. No complaints on the tabouli either. 

No table service is the only knock I would give them, but the food was outstanding"}
{"text":"Living in Parma, the food landscape is filled with fast food joints and assembly-line chain restaurants. Thank heavens for Sittoo's. The food is fresh, healthy, tasty, and cheap. After I eat there, I want to go right back for seconds. The lamb sandwich, fries, and hummus is better than anything the fast food palaces lining Ridge Rd. could ever dream of serving. The service is always warm and personable. Whenever I stop in to pick up my order (which is often), I am greeted with a smile. This is one of my family's favorites. If you haven't been there, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"The food is just too good! Actually options for people switching to or already Vegan/Vegetarian. Every time I arrive the place is clean, staff on point. I come here way more often than any other restaurant, not much healthier eats places out there. Taste is one of a kind as well. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. It's in between a fast food place and a sit down restaurant and is simply decorated."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Sittoo's on numerous occasions and I've loved everything every time.  Haven't had a single thing here that I've disliked. 

I am in love with their hummus!! Could eat it all day long.

I make special trips just to stock up :)"}
{"text":"Only been a handful of times, but so far so good. Great hummus, fattoush, and pita sandwiches. Highly recommend. It's fast, really good, healthy, and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"They server vegetarian dishes. I like pizza. They served no pizza. Part of me was upset, part of me intrigued. 

Turns out they have good food."}
{"text":"I've gone to Aladdin's a few times and was never really impressed. When you walk in, the inside is really nice and there's ample seating. You order at the counter and then they bring it to you when it's ready. You even get real plates and silverware! The girl at the front was very pleasant and nice! The food was nothing short of amazing!! I got the beef kafta wrap and a side of tabouli. The beef had a cinnamon flavor that worked really well. The lemon tahini sauce was also very good! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves middle eastern food and even those who aren't sure!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and every time it's good. It unassuming tucked back in an old Dairy Mart building. 

The hummus is really good. As a matter of fact all of their food it is good. Salad, falafel, all nicely prepared. Never have had a bad meal or bad experience. Just as good as Aladdins. 

When I'm in the area I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is really good ! I'm a little upset that I never knew about this place earlier. Lucky for me some friends of mine already had the lowdown. Located somewhere in Parma, it's worth the trip for a solid meal. I ordered the shawarma chicken plate, which was amazing. Plentiful pieces of chicken, rice, greens, sides of tzatziki & tahini sauce, and taboon bread. I'm definitely interested in the lamb next time and most likely getting a shawarma sandwich in the near future. Maybe adding a side of falafels since I grew up on those classic delights."}
{"text":"The falafel pita is amazing. The hot sauce is as good this time as my last.  We drove out of our way and I cannot say enough about how good their food is."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, I came for the opening and once a week for yrs. 

I have a food allergy to certain kinds of meat and even when I order the vegetarian dishes I would have to go to the ER immediately. Twice this happened. When I tried to say something to the staff, they handled it quite badly.

Because of my work schedule I only eat once a day, so there's nothing else if could have been.

This is my second review, because my first one was DELETED."}
{"text":"Sittoo's has quickly become one of our favorite affordable places in the area. The food has been reliably good the number of times we've visited, and has always been cooked fresh to order. Every other week, I do a takeout lunch from the North Olmsted location, and we've eaten at and ordered takeout from the Parma location. I really appreciate that they let you customize the pita sandwiches-I cannot eat raw tomatoes, and I'm not a fan of some of the other additions like beets or turnips. I always go for their falafel pita sandwiches, and I love the home style pickles wrapped up in there! I'm a big fan of their falafel-it's always perfectly crunchy, herby without being overpowered by the herbs (I'm not a fan of falafel that's so filled with herbs it's green), and it's seasoned so tastily! My husband enjoys the beef kafta pita sandwich, and we both want to try the shishtawook sandwich soon (a favorite of mine from a Lebanese restaurant back home in NY). We also enjoy the seasoned fries, which seem to be seasoned with some form of za'atar spice. The hummus is pretty good, and the pita is pretty yummy. Pro-tip: you can buy a multi-pita package from Sitoo's cheaper than most grocery stores! The last time we went with friends, they ordered baklava and a combo, all of which looked delicious! Sittoo's is definitely worth checking out for a tasty, fast, and affordable meal! We also appreciate that the food is a fairly healthier alternative to many other options out there in a similar price point. The staff is always friendly, and the place is always clean as well."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while (mainly because this is no longer my regular route). Planning on getting my typical shishtawook sandwich, I opted instead for the business man's lunch special. It is a sampling of their delicious menu. I am only half way through it and I stopped to write a review!  It is SOOO good! Whether you're near here or not, you need to stop. You won't be sorry. The place is immaculate with wonderful food."}
{"text":"Okay, I can't keep coming here almost every week and not give this place 5-stars.  

This place is affordable and the food is great.  It's a family run business.  I asked if they owned Aladdin's and they said they bought the place from the guy who owns Aladdin's.

I wish they had a menu so I can tell you what's good on it.  But it's basically everything except well, the ground lamb kabobs are just okay.  The beef kabob are awesome.  The shawarma is great.  The platters come with plenty of food.  The best thing is the food is fresh.  You can't go wrong with fresh , made to order food.

I bought a flat grill at home to try to replicate what they do ... no luck so far.  Go here.  You won't be disappointed. ."}
{"text":"Veggie platter was great and filling. Falafels especially good. The lady finger baklava also delicious. Customer service noted to also be excellent. Friendly environment. Menu with lots of options."}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern food. I wish I would have found this place sooner. The staff is very nice. I am going to treat my mother to lunch here."}
{"text":"Yum! 
FYI if you use yelp directions they are wrong. It's ridge just south of snow road."}
{"text":"Sittoo's always hits the spot - and at a great price! The combos (meat or vegetarian) are always a good bet. Pretty much always count on paying the extra $.50 for the fresh garlic sauce because you must get it. 

I got the mujadara meal (lentils, rice, and fried onion rings) and it was pretty good eaten along with the pita, tahini and garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Always such a great time, great food, great service!  Can't go wrong with the Sittoo's Combo Platter, add a hot sauce on the side and you are set for any meal!  I love the baba, it has such a great natural flavor you cannot find anywhere else.  Clean good eating is just south of Snow on Ridge.  This is my go to when I don't feel like cooking.  Highly recommend, I've been here over 20x."}
{"text":"Love this place. Especially since I don't know of any healthy, affordable, ethnic or vegetarian options there are around this area. Everything here is delicious and well executed. I usually to with a salad, dawali, and some hot sauce. 

Food comes out quick, and did I mention it is extremely affordable?!"}
{"text":"Has been our go to spot for Lebanese food for the past 4 years. Highly recommend the lamb wrap and falafel. Hummus is also great. Never any complaints. Place is clean and owner/employees always friendly."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by here for quick dinner. On a hunt to find the best shawarma Cleveland has to offer, I figured it would be best I try that. So I ordered a beef shawarma, with all the extras they add in. Five minutes later, it came out. 

It was very hot and the ingredients had a fresh taste, however it's not the authentic shawarma I thought it would be, it was probably cooked on a stovetop or grill. But overall the flavor was good. 

The place itself has a lot of artwork hung on the walls, which I personally enjoyed looking at. It is also very, very clean which is a plus! The gentleman working was extremely pleasant too. 

Other people that have recommend this restaurant, recommended that I come for a sit down full out dinner with entrees and platters. I think I would like to give that a try next time and I will update my review then."}
{"text":"Excellent quality Lebanese food served in a super clean and attractive environment. I had the veggie combo platter on my last visit, and thought everything on the plate was way above average...perfectly fried falafel, and tasty versions of babaganoush, stuffed grape leaves and hummus, served with tabouli salad, tahini sauce and pita bread, which came to the table warm. Nice touch! The man who waited on us counter-side asked if we wanted garlic sauce or hot sauce with our meals, and we opted to try both. The garlic sauce is, well, very garlicky, and the hot sauce was delicious...a mix of fresh chiles in vinegar and olive oil with, again, plenty of garlic. This sauce is not very hot, and was a great addition to the food, so don't skip it. You can get water from the soda machine and keep things inexpensive, but they were offering a wonderful iced pomegranate green tea (unsweetened...thank you!) on the day we had lunch, and I highly recommend that.

Service here is friendly and helpful, and they treat you like your business really matters to them. I will return."}
{"text":"Good food.  I always order the same, which is the kids chicken and rice.  Perfect size for my adult lunch.  Although I'm not a fan of all their cuisine, my office frequently orders from there for lunch.  Consistently good, authentic dishes.  Cost is reasonable."}
{"text":"It's normally good food and made fast but today the salad was so fresh it seemed like there must be a garden out back and the meat incredibly juicy, you cannot beat the business lunch special, the owner is always friendly and seems to be working hard.  Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"This place was an amazing find. Clean establishment and  friendly staff. Love love this place. This place is a must if your in the mood for pita and hummus. There build your own pita sandwich is amazing. Thanks yelp!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of favorite places to eat.   The food is ALWAYS fresh and delicious.   On this visit, I had the Chicken Shwarma rolled pita and a small order of tabbouli.  The portion of chicken was generous and the meat was seasoned and tender.  The accompanying lemon tahini sauce was excellent and the tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and turnips were very fresh.   The tabbouli was fresh, juicy and tangy.....exactly like I like it!   I'll definitely go back, soon!!"}
{"text":"This is the best lebanese food you can get around Cleveland that I've seen.  Better than Aladdin's in my opinion, even though I hear the two companies are closely related.  I go here all the time and never have a complaint.  Tastes awesome."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! Best baba I have had in a long time! The Lamb was delicious too! The chicken shawarma was amazing as well. Great music as well. This place is one to frequent!"}
{"text":"It's hard to beat takeout from this restaurant when going to the airport. While the food would be better eaten hot inside the restaurant, the takeout was still better than anything one can get at the airport, and is conveniently on the way. I called ahead, got off the exit, filled up my rental car, and the food was ready when I walked through the door. Maybe five minutes from the time I called. They took my credit card, and I was out the door in two minutes. The staff was extremely pleasant, and I can't wait to come back for a sit-down meal."}
{"text":"My first time here I love it. It's  awesome services. Delicious food. It's the best hummus ever. Everything was great. Very friendly people. I recommend everyone to come to sittos and try awesome food and services. You not going to be sorry and the prices reasonable for your pocket. Thanks to sittos  for everything."}
{"text":"Great service and hospitality. I enjoy the Business Man's Special. Plenty of food and wonderful tasting. The place is clean with ample parking in back. Prices are reasonable and you get a large portion. I will definitely make this one of my favorite places to go to for lunch."}
{"text":"I was treated to lunch at Sittoo's earlier this week.  It's a clean, bright space with friendly servers, cheap prices and delicious Lebanese food.  I had the falafel sandwich and really liked it.  I wasn't a fan of the pickles-- but I never am, so my bad for not asking to have them removed-- but the falafel itself was delicious as was the pita and the lemon tahini dressing.  It was a little on the small side, so if you're very hungry I'd suggest getting a side dish too.  My table-mates both ordered the business lunch, which looked awesome and was definitely a steal for the price (three kinds of meat, salad, rice, and pita).

I'd definitely be a regular if I lived in Parma."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mediterranean food in town!! Super clean and generous portions along with reasonable pricing. Eat in dinning as well as take out."}
{"text":"Do you have a hankerin' for some hummus? Do you salivate over shawarma? When you're famished do your thoughts turn to falafel? If you answered yes to any of these questions I've got the place for you, my friend. Sittoo's (Grandma's in Lebanese) is home to some of the best Middle Eastern cookery this side of the fertile crescent and because it's close to home you won't have to risk deep vein thrombosis and multiple wandings to get there.

Just a short drive from Cleveland, past the Polish Village in Parma and tucked away on a cramped little corner, Sittoo's is just what the Ha'kim ordered. Over the last several years I've developed a bit of an obsession with cuisine of this ilk. I don't eat it all the time but when I've got a craving it hits me pretty hard. I love the spices, the use of cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, cloves, chilis, the sauces dosed heavily with garlic, creamy yogurt and cucumber. I'm getting all Pavlov's dog over here.

The menu at Sittoo's has all of the standards like mujadara, shish kebab, kafta kebab, fattoush and falafel. Speaking of falafel, Sittoo's falafel is good. really good. Crispity, crunchity chickpea balls of goodness. World's best? Not sure, but I doubt you'll be disappointed. Anyway, if you're new to Middle Eastern eating the selection here reads a bit like a primer in the basics. And since everything's spelled out you don't have to worry about being surprised. They've taken all the guesswork out of it so you're free to explore.

The other thing I really liked about Sittoo's is their dining room. When you walk in the first thing you'll notice is how big the place is.  It's been my experience with other places of this genre that they're more take-out than eat-in. Sittoo's has plenty of seating with both booth and table options. One thing to note, as other's have mentioned, it's pretty chilly inside. During our visit it definitely felt like the A/C was set at 11. Bring a jacket/sweater.

There is a bit of a process when it comes to eating here, so let me break it down for you noobs:

Step 1: Approach the counter. If unsure of what you want either ask for suggestions or take a gander at the menu that's placed strategically by the register.

Step 2: Place your order with very friendly, hair-net-wearing employee and remit payment immediately. She'll ask for your name and bring your food out to you when it's ready. BTW, if you're asked if you want the hot sauce and garlic sauce, say yes to both.

Step 3: Drinks and eating gear are to the right. Select a plastic cup, get your ice, or not, grab some utensils, napkins, etc. and make your way to a table.

Step 4: Eat until you're uncomfortably full.

Step 5: Clean up after your damn selves. This means bussing your own tables. 

We arrived for our visit around 6pm on a Wednesday and the place was pretty empty. There was, however, a pretty regular stream of people stopping in for take-out orders. Here's the rundown:

Vegetarian Combo App - Perfect for sharing. Amazingly smooth hummus, incredibly garlicky baba ganoush, two falafel, two diwali and a generous helping of tabouli. I found the hummus to be a bit bland compared to the baba and the falafel were damn tasty. Not a huge fan of tabouli (basically a parsley salad) but when mixed with the other two made a decent condiment. And who knew that rice and chick peas wrapped in a grape leaf could be so good?

Sittoo's Combo - Also perfect for two this platter is a greatest hits on a plate. Shish Kabob (marinated, grilled beef cubes), Kafta Kabob (Middle Eastern ground beef cylinder), Chicken Shawarma, and Falafel. Served with rice pilaf, Lebanese salata and warm pita bread. I could have eaten twice the amount of meat that was included in this sampler, ut I was sharing, so there's that. The chicken was juicy, tender and perfectly spiced, and both the beef offerings were delicious. Once again, the salad was just OK and the rice, well, rice.

We had a great experience at Sittoo's. Friendly staff, delicious food, fantastic Arabic music piped through the sound system, clean dining room. It ticks all the boxes. Our total bill came to just about $20 (including a drink that we shared)."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience. Food was delicious and the customer service was phenomenal!! We had the Dawali, the Vegetarian Combo, Sittoo's salad with chicken, and the Kinafa.  Every single thing was so darn tasty and the prices were reasonable. We live in Akron and will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Sittoos is a great find in an otherwise sad landscape of chain restaurants. I love their hummus and you can't go wrong- their food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here fairly frequently.   I think of this place as Aladdin's sporty sister.   If Aladdin's were Ginger, Sittoo's would be Mary Ann.   The food is every bit as good as Aladdin's (better maybe?) but the people here are so much more inviting.   I always thought Aladdin's was just a smidge on the pretentious side.   I have never had anything here that I didn't just love.   Their hummos may be a little heavy on the tahini for some people, but it is still really good.   I would say my favorites would have to be the shawarma, the mujadara, and the foole.   My husband (NOT the world's most adventurous eater) loves their shish kabob.   He isn't a huge Middle Eastern food fan, and he frequently suggests that we eat here.  Their kid's chicken is not your standard fried nuggets.   It is marinated, grilled chicken skewers, and they are awesome.    Their hot sauce is fantastic.   It has a lot of flavor, beside being hot.   The people there are all very nice, and very willing to discuss their menu, suggest dishes etc.   Oh.   I almost forgot.   If you like cashews, you have to try the cashew baklava.   The bottom line is, if you love Middle Eastern food, or if you think you kind of like it, their staff will help you to find the perfect dish for you.   Being that I am not Middle Eastern, I don't know if it's authentic.   I just know it tastes great."}
{"text":"I rarely go 5 stars but as far as Mediterranean food goes this place is great. I always get the vegetarian combo and I get baba too. You will be full with left overs. The place is cute clean and has free wifi"}
{"text":"From service to food, this is truly a 5 star experience. My girlfriend and I tried this place a few years ago and have made it our number 1 go to restaurant. All the entrees, especially the chicken shawarma and lamb entreeare taste delicious and prepared fresh. If you like traditionial Lebanese dishes like dawali, tabouli, or falafel, you will not find a place that makes it any better in the cleveland area. This place is affordable, has great food, and is very welcoming. I would recommend going to the one in Parma over the one in North Olmsted. The one in Parma for whatever reason is different. The food is better and service is significantly better at the Parma location. I would avoid the North Olmsted location if possible, but if not its still good."}
{"text":"This is such a great place!  Every time we've been there, the staff has been friendly and welcoming.  The menu has a lot of variety, good for both carnivores and vegetarians.  The food is really excellent, and the prices are MUCH less than another Middle Eastern food chain in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly service. This place has a new take on fresh with old world flair."}
{"text":"Figured it was time for an update, since I haven't in 2 years.

Place is still spotless inside. Decor has not changed (I still want the dresser).

Service is actually better. The lady taking my order (with awesome tattoos) was absolutely awesome! I have not had better service anywhere in the area.

Food is still great. Kafta kabob was moist and perfectly seasoned. Hummus was excellent. And the baklava? Heavenly.

Prices are amongst the cheapest in the area. Seriously, pizza places cost more."}
{"text":"What a fun find! We were out here for the Arhaus Warehouse and looking for a lunch spot. Thanks to other Yelp reviewers, we tried this cute little middle eastern (Lebanese in this case) spot. My bf is Israeli, so he's a tough critic of Middle Eastern fare; but we were both thrilled with the food here. The falafel was light, tender, and moist in the center; not the dense hockey pucks at most places. The hummus was creamy perfection! I almost always prefer baba, but not here. My bf said the falafel and hummus were the best he's had in the U.S.

The chicken shawarma was tender and flavorful. The beef shawarma tasty, if a little dry. I loved it, the bf not so much. The salads were light, fresh, and delicious. We'll be back. And my bf already texted his whole family to recommend it."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best Middle Eastern food I have ever had. I've tried probably close to 75% of the menu and honestly there isn't a thing on the menu I don't like. 

My favorite item is their falafels, either the platter when I'm very hungry, or a wrap if I'm only a bit peckish. 

My BF often gets the meat sampler platter and he says it's always excellent. 

We probably eat here every other week at least, if not more often. Do yourself a favor and check out this awesome food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always clean, and a cute comfortable atmosphere. Service is fast and friendly. The food is always fresh and delicious. We love this place for lunch :)"}
{"text":"I popped in here to grab something quick to go before I had to get to a meeting.  So glad I did!  The server at the register recommended the Chicken Schawarma (sp.?) as an item that could be made quickly.  He was right!  It wasn't even 5 minutes after I paid that my food was ready to go.  It was delicious!  Everything was very fresh and tasty.  A generous helping of fresh hummus was included- I recommend you pay for an extra \"bread\" for dipping in the hummus since there is plenty left over after you use the one included bread.

The sit down dining area was very clean and inviting.  Even though I was here at noon on a weekday, there were plenty of available tables.

I can't wait to try the many other items on the menu in the near future now that I work nearby."}
{"text":"Portions are ambient for a kid of 10yrs old, very upsetting to pay $20 and find out kid size portions after taking it home. Want to give zero star however I was forced to give one star to submit the review. What a waste.. double chicken in entree is additional $4."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sittoo's!!! I live very close and it takes everything in me not to stop and eat there everyday. I especially like the hummus with hot sauce and I always order a dawali wrap with turnips, lettuce, tomato, feta cheese and house dressing. I should also note that this isn't even on the menu and they go above and beyond to satisfy the customer's request. Everyone is super nice there and even though you order the food and seat yourself many times your food is delivered to you at the table. Because of this I always give a nice tip in the tip jar :-)  I would recommend that if you are anywhere in the area stop by Sittoo's. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A Middle Eastern restaurant in the middle of Polish Village in Parma, Ohio?  Very unexpected experience.  I have been a fan of the Aladdin's chain for years, and went here to pick up lunch.  Compact location, with small parking lot.  Decor is clean and trendy, except for some of the \"homey\" art that is out of place - roosters, toy trucks, \"welcome friends\" sign.  But you really don't  come here for the decor -- it is the food.  Nice variety of Middle Eastern salads, wraps, and desserts.  All nicely seasoned and flavorful.  Minimal wait time for fresh preparation.  Also, most items are under $6, which makes it a great location for lunch.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time here. Came based on Yelp reviews and a hankering for a salad. I was greeted upon entering. I asked the nice girl behind the counter to recommend one and I'm glad she did bc it was one of the best salads I've had in a long time. The grilled chicken was moist and tasty. Chicken is my litmus test for a new place bc it is so easily and often over cooked. The two homemade sauces that came with it, hot and garlic, were fantastic. The place was clean and fairly priced. 5 star experience:)"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and now I've finally decided to write a review. I think compared to the other Mediterranean food places around the city this is one of the best. In fact I personally think it's better than Alladins.  I usually get the spicy Kaftka wrap but this time I got the kaftka plate which was pretty good as well. It contained 3 meat kabobs with rice and salad. It also came with pita bread. I chose the spicy sauce and garlic sauce for side items. Both were great choices. Also the service here is always pretty good as well. I recommend this place. Just wish there was one closer to where I lived!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be in Garfield Heights, I loved it! Then they relocated in Parma, I was so happy to find it again because the food is very unique and most of all authentic. It is very light and filling, if you haven't ate here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Excellent was there last week for lunch met the owner ,, food and service was great couldn't ask for better"}
{"text":"So close to home & very quick!!  I always get the grape leaves & the vegetarian platter!"}
{"text":"I simply love this place! I can't stress enough how pleased I am that they have done well in Parma, of all places. 
Their baba is some of the best that I've had. 
Yum yum yummmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot . Love everything on the menu. Their salads are nice sized and dressed well. Lental soup and chill both spot on with and can top w feta . I really enjoy the lamb plate with rice . Then dont leave with out a cup of coffee . Small serves two perfect . The staff is always friendly , food comes out fast and hot . Again perfect lunch spot. However not a datenight type of place ."}
{"text":"I was traveling for work and looking for something quick to dine and dash on my own. I try to go for healthy choices and was intrigued by other Yelp reviews. Sittoo's has a modest front shop with a slightly dated interior. Despite this, after entering I knew I had made a good choice!

Everything here is cooked fresh. The vegetables, seasoning, and meat were all really well treated. I had the Sittoo's combo platter so that I could try a little bit of everything. I loved the flaffel and the chicken; juicy and flavorful. The rice was ok and the small side salad with the classic oil dressing was great. The only item that could be improved was the side pita which looked to be the only thing that was store bought.

I was the only patron dining which was a little awkward, but all in all worth it for fresh food. I took a bachalava to go and savoured it over the course of my drive."}
{"text":"Sittoos has some great food. I love the lunch special... You get a little bit of everything for a good price. Their falafels are also a great choice! Perfectly crispy on the outside and such a great flavor. Mmm."}
{"text":"The food here was awesome! I ordered falafel with salad, rice, and a pita. They gave me this garlic sauce which was awesome!!! It tasted very fresh. I thought the value for the food was average to good. The restaurant was clean and the staff was professional although you don't interact with them much as this isn't a restaurant with wait staff. You order from a counter and they bring the food to you. You refill your own sodas. Also, side note, they offer soda water from their fountain which is very rare in Cleveland (only other place I've seen this was chipotle). I will add this to my rotation of parma restaurants for sure!"}
{"text":"This among my favorite Lebanese/middle eastern eatery in Cleveland.  The highlights of the menu include the super smooth humus and fresh warm pita bread.  I had a fatoosh salad with grilled chicken - the chicken was tangy, spiced well and very tender.  I also had a spicy kafta roll with a side of spicy sauce.   It was all so delicious and affordable.   If you like zatar, citrus and garlic you will like the food at Sittoo's!  They have a nice sit down area or you can get take away.   Great food at a great price.  Be sure to get some baklava to take home!"}
{"text":"I guess I expected more from a Lebanese restaurant. The food was good but very lemony and not much flavor. It was too expensive for the quality of the food. Service was great though!"}
{"text":"Sittoo's is a little haven of deliciousness in Parma. They are owned and operated by the same family as the Aladdin's restaurants, but honestly I find the food here to be better. It is much more casual and even though the food is made to order, it is served very quickly making this a great lunch or take-away option. My favorite are the sandwiches, which are chock-full of pickles and turnips. The service is exceptionally friendly and the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Sittoo's is a place that we frequent, as we're usually around the area. I am always happy that they're open for me with excellent food. I don't like going to the typical places and getting fried, greasy food. Sittoo's offers a really great alternative and leaves me feeling satisfied. 

The staff is always friendly and swift with my order. I like the feeling that it's quaint and cozy. 
I will always recommend Sittoo's to anyone who is looking for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. I had the hummus and Chicken Swarma. Both were delicious. Very authentic Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Seasoned and cooked well. Healthy too. Similar to La Shish in Dearborn, MI."}
{"text":"The baba is the best in town. If you're unsure what to get, try the Business Lunch Special, a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Just had take-out the other night - fantastic! I'm a repeat customer who only wishes you had a closer location - I live on the south side of Broadview Heights. Interestingly enough, I took a friend to the new North Olmsted location yesterday. Very similar - your hummus is better! I just finished off my leftovers this afternoon - delicious hummus, tabbouleh. Can't get enough!!!"}
{"text":"This great little joint in Parma rocks. You like Aladdin's, right? (If you don't, I'm sorry, this is where our relationship ends.) This place is like an informal Aladdin's, cheaper and faster, with fountain drinks. I went with two other friends, and the table, in 10 minutes, was covered in cheap, great Mediterranean eats. I had the shawarma sandwich, but the hummos entree and whatever my vegetarian friend got both looked delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'll have to echo the comments of others - this is a very good, less expensive, cash and carry version of the local Aladdin's chain. I love the food at Aladdin's and the same goes for this small place that inhabits an old Lawsons building on Ridge Rd. in the heart of Parma. I'd say the menu is nearly identical, but the flavors are slighting different and cost is lower. Hummus (don't forget the hot sauce!) and baba, the hummus shwarma plate, and the falafel salad with tahini sauce are all excellent. The lentil and rice dish is also tasty. Just grabbed a bag of this tasty fare as take-out last night. No servers (who needs 'em?), but a nice, smallish eat-in area suffices if you want to stay. A great place to satisfy your cravings for some Mediterranean fare."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Sittoo's Pita & Salads in one week. Every dish that i ordered was delicious. The place is clean everything is made fresh. I didn't eat there, but got it to go."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sittoo's for years, and I was happy to enjoy it on a recent trip to Cleveland. They are super friendly and the food is awesome. I used to be a huge fan of Aladdin's, but Sittoo's is now number one in my book. Their hummus is creamy and delicious and the pitas are always really fresh. My regular order is the Sittoo's falafel sandwich with a side of hot sauce. Soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"So Sitto's used to equal Mediterranean cuisine love for my stomach. And now they have been depressing my stomach and wallet. It used to feel friendly, like in the way where extra hot sauce on the side was just free of charge. They took care of your little needs!! Now any sauce extra is an additional 50 cents. Wahhhhh. And they are kind of  sneaky about, offering additions but not informing you of the surcharge...

Menu and flavor is still there but definitely has gone downhill. Serving sizes are dwindling. The baklava, which should be ooey gooey with honey, is so dry while the nuts taste like cardboard. Falafel was good  but come on... Such punny sizes and i felt like I needed to drench in sauce/hummus. Skip it before it's too late. Just go to Taza."}
{"text":"Finally found a place that serves Chicken Shwarma!!!!! I have been dying and craving Chicken Shwarma since I've left Texas back in January and it is now almost March so I felt a bit deprived until now!! Saw this place on yelp and decided to give it a try.

The place was very clean and the music was very traditional.  There were a lot of windows which brought a lot of light into the atmosphere and made it feel positive.  The service was super fast and had to wait for a couple minutes for my meal in which I ordered a Chicken Shwarma of course and a small pita and hummus.  The amount of hummus they give you was very generous for the one pita she gave me, which I'm not complaining for I would have ordered more pita if instant already full from the Chicken Shwarma.  The Chicken Shwarma definitely hit the spot!!!! Im absolutely in love!  There was so much flavor in every bite!  I am so amazingly satisfied and will come here again and will highly recommend it to anyone craving Mediterranean food! :)"}
{"text":"Yum! This place has very delicious food! You definitely have to try this place your next meal."}
{"text":"Yum!  I just moved here from VA and this place is in walking distance!  My dogs were getting ancy today doin thought I'd walk down the road and do some exploring and get food.  I really like that they have a couple tables, chairs and benches outside!  A nice little icing on the cake is they have some nice middle eastern music playing outside that's at just the right volume to provide some charm but not a distraction!  

The food here is fantastic and at a great price (everything in VA is wildly overpriced).  I got the Sittoo Sampler (I think that's what it was...) because I couldn't decide and it was de-lish!!!!  The girl behind the counter was super sweet and accommodating too."}
{"text":"Great authentic Lebanese food. Quick and affordable too! Can't miss by stopping in to eat - you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Basically, this business is owned by the same company that owns Aladdins, and both are great in my book.  The fare is limited to a smaller takeout type menu, but the quality does not suffer.  Parking is also limited to a few spots in front of the building.  However, on the other side of the cake shop next door their is a large open parking lot.

My personal favs are their chili and chicken hummus.  They have no problem with catering to special dietary needs. This is the closest Mediterranean restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"While I love where we live, there is hardy a plethora of Middle Eastern cuisine nearby, so when I read the great reviews for Sittoo's I thought take out for dinner tonight sounded appropriate. Sure, it was a 20 minute drive each way, but the good news is that it's a trip I'll be making on a regular basis. 

Ordered the hummos, baba ghanoush, and a couple of spinach pies. We could not have been more pleased with everything.  Even the pitas seemed better than most  we've had elsewhere, and I usually think of those as fairly generic. Wrong. 

It's really great seeing a restaurant like this succeed in a part of the area not necessarily known for it's cultural diversity. Congrats to Sittoo's for making it easy to appreciate what they do and to the folks in and around Parma for giving them a chance to do it. 

If you live within reasonable driving distance and in the mood for Middle Eastern food, by all means give Sittoo's a try.  You won't find anything as good--let alone better--in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick, delicious, and healthy bite to eat for a reasonable price.  The food is always fresh, staff is friendly, and the place is well kept and clean.  I highly recommend the Sittoo's Combo which features a sampling of chicken schwarma, kabob, kafta, and falafel served with a side of salad, rice pilaf and a piece of pita for under $10."}
{"text":"Owner was funny and welcoming. Currently waiting on my to-go order right now so I will update once I taste the food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean and adorable dining room, delicious food and reasonable prices.  Sorry it took me so long to try..  but I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Business lunch is really good and super cheap. The place is clean and the service is always friendly. Not much parking but it's rarely crowded and I've never not had a parking place."}
{"text":"Love it here! Usually get the Sittoo's combo because  I can't decide what I like best and it gives a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"I happened upon Sitoo's by chance (as many of my discoveries are) and am thrilled that I have another great place to visit while I am out & about in the Parma area. You'll notice at once the interior is clean, well-organized, and fragrant. Very welcome features for a traveller with an appetite. The menu board is clear and abundant. - Be sure to pause by the greeting table to consider the daily special being featured. The smiling hostess is eager to explain the selections if unfamiliar with Middle Eastern style of cuisine, and I am enticed with my options. The wait was quite short for what was so exotic a selection.  In what seemed minutes, I was enjoying a satisfying and most delicious lunch that exceeded my hopes. I am very fond of hummous, and theirs is rich, creamy, and a perfect compliment to the plate. The portion is a balance that doesn't lend to feeling overstuffed when entirely consumed and leaves you with just enough room for dessert. And how happy you will be that you gave it a go...the dessert selection is as good as it gets with the mark of homemade quality and cultural deliciousness as part of the recipe.   
  I am giving this a 4-star rating since it is just my first visit and I have a desire to return often to discover more of Parma's wholesome haven. And that is just the point...you will definitely want to stop by often and journey among  the interesting fare and make your own discoveries that you can call your favorites.  I am sure that it will earn its fifth 5 star soon enough though. 
  There is no WiFi here (yet) and I hope that it is soon added."}
{"text":"I've been driving by Sittoo's ever since it opened and I've never once stopped in for a bite of their Lebanese fare.  Since it's in my back yard, you would think I would've eaten here before.

Anyway, it was getting really late and we hadn't eaten dinner one night so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I looked online and found that Sittoo's has a website with a menu.  I asked the wife and kids what they wanted and we called Sittoo's to place our order.  Fifteen minutes later, I drove over to sittoo's (just two blocks away) and the order was hot and ready.  

We ordered the following menu items: 
Hummos appetizer ($2.95 small)
Falaffel appetizer ($3.95)
Chicken and fries (for the kids - $2.50)
Sittoo's Falaffel Sandwich ($3.85)
Chicken Shawarma Entree ($6.95)

All were delicious!  I am recovering from a cold, so I didn't quite get the full effect of everything, but it all still tasted great.

The Hummos didn't seem to have a lot of flavor, but it came with some steaming hot pita breads!  The Falaffel appetizer was really good - deep fried Falaffel balls.  I tasted the kids chicken and fries and they were really delicious - far above standard fast food fare.  The Falaffel Sandwich was really good.  It was rolled up in a tortilla-like bread and grilled.  Yummy.  Finally, the Chicken Shawarma was my favorite dish.  I mixed the chicken, the rice and the greens together and poured the tasty white sauce all over it like a salad.  It was really delicious!

The total bill came to $24.70, it was a lot of food and we will be returning again!

Recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! The prices are fantastic and the staff is very friendly. I have not had a bad meal here. My two go tos are the vegetarian combo and falaffel salad with hot sauce. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Aladdin's you will definitely like Sittoo's. It will possibly become your new favorite Lebanese/Mediterranean spot! I've always enjoyed Lebanese food and I would generally go to Aladdin's or Taza. But then we found this gem (Sitoo's) and it's become my \"go-to\". For the price, quantity and last but certainly not least- quality- you honestly cannot beat it! Personally, I highly recommend their falafel and lamb. My last piece of advice- make sure to get the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"It is so awesome to have a great middle eastern restaurant so close. I always get the tabouli and shwarma roll. I find that shwarma rolls are always different depending on where you go and I love that this one has turnips added in. The service is always great here and the owners are extremely nice and have kept the place in great shape for years. I am not a big fan of hummus but every friend I take here seems to really enjoy theirs. The tabouli, shwarma roll and a bag of pita ends up totaling around 12 dollars and I always end up having some left over for a snack. You can't go wrong for that price! If your looking for great middle eastern food, check it out."}
{"text":"This was a random night of take out on the other side of town and I'm happy it was!  Chicken shawarma entree with the added garlic sauce and a side of pita and hummus was delightful. Filling but not too much. Just found out there is one on the west side too! Definitely going to order again."}
{"text":"Very impressed.  Clean, spacious, nicely decorated.  Friendly staff.  Food is fresh, healthy, delicious and inexpensive.  Good stuff. I ordered the chicken shawarma entree and I loved it."}
{"text":"How good can falafel be? Answer that after trying theirs with the garlic sauce. Perfectly light and crispy outer with deliciously moist and flavorful inner. Can't remember having better falafel. The baklava is above par as well."}
{"text":"This is a pretty fatty thing to say, but as soon as I cleaned my plate of Sittoo's Combo, I seriously wanted a second one - it was that good! 

The salad and rice was among the best I've ever tasted, and the grape leaves were DEFINITELY the best.  All the prices were very reasonable, and the service was super friendly and fast. 

I can't believe I have driven past this place a million times and never checked it out until recently. I will definitely be back, and often."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Pitas are always served warm and soft. Baklava to die for. My favorite there is the kafta kabob entree and their baba ghanouj is simply awesome! If you're in the mood for Mediterranean - this is THE PLACE to go! Easily the best in this side of town."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean at prices that seem like a steal. The atmosphere is clean and casual. The food does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Excellent food for a good value. The lunch specials have generous portions. The sauces, especially the hot sauce, really bring out the flavor of the food. They have the best baklava I've ever had. We usually get take out, but when we eat there the service is great too."}
{"text":"Always very good!  I usually get the Sittoos combo & extra hummus.  Love the hot sauce too!  And the pita is yummy!  So fresh tasting & the folks are always friendly.  I also personally think they have the best falafel."}
{"text":"I love going here for my lunch break. Everything I've gotten has been fresh and the chicken I got on my salad definitely tasted grilled and juicy. Their prices are reasonable and you get a good amount of food. The owner is always very friendly and there is rarely a long wait when I get there."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Saturday for lunch after hanging out at my friend's house in Parma. I had the hummus with chicken and a side of rice. I don't think it is that much cheaper than Aladdin's. It may be just about the same. The food tastes the same too. I like the fact that you can order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. I don't always like getting waited on. The meal came out to about $9, which wasn't bad. It was enough for leftovers too. I still prefer Sahara on Lorain for Arab food."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, what's usually a $20 meal for two costs $30 now, they really pack on extra charges now for little things. 
The chunks of lamb were inedible, couldn't even cut them with a knife.
The pita was stale, who serves stale bread? Must be trying to save a buck. 
Turkish coffee was old and burnt, again trying to save a buck by not brewing a fresh pot. 
The garlic sauce tasted and had the color of mayonnaise, yuk!"}
{"text":"I am updating this review to let you know that Sittos delivers through a variety of delivery apps. I used Deal Dash (or Delivery Dash? I don't remember. But the first time was free) and I am too happy tostand it! First of all, I don't thinktheres a minimum order. Secondly, you can order a LOT of food from Sittos and not spend a lot of money. Thirdly, you feel virtuous because it's really pretty healthy. Unless you get a tray of baklava, and even then, walnuts g are good for your brain. I am having leftovers for breakfast right now and feeling good about it, but wishing I'd gottensome baklava. Anyway, now youcan have Sittos when ever you want. These people deserve every penny they make."}
{"text":"I heard nothing but how great this place was. I had no idea it seems to be a chain. Everything was bland. Baba ghanooj had zero flavor. Lentil soup was watery and flavorless. Spinich pie was obviously microwaved, and Shish Tawook chicken looked like beef it was so dry. I thought the price was good, but for what we got and the quality, it was a waste. I have Lebanese relatives, they would never touch this. Sad."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean food. Can dine in our take out. Fair prices and decent portion sizes."}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to trying unfamiliar foods and sauces, but this place is good!  You wouldn't think to try it, but I'm glad I worked up the courage to try it.  Very flavorful and a great value."}
{"text":"Cheap tasty Mediterranean fare!

This place used to be my weekly stop with the girls. However in the last couple visits it has unfortunately gone down hill. 

Prices have been slowly going up. Service isn't as quick as it used to be especially if you're trying to place a take out order.

The food however is still just as tasty. The hummus with hot sauce is still one of my death row meals! I could it eat it all day, every day!!
The lamb Kafka is wonderfully spiced and seared to perfection. 
Let's not forget the hot fried and tasty falafel! (make sure you get a side of both tahini and garlic, they are epic when mixed together!)

Even though the service has declined for an already pretty unremarkable dining experience. The food is still tasty, hot and fresh. 

FYI - this is a sister restaurant to Taza and Aladdins so the menu is nearly identical but with cheaper price tags!"}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place. Since I've never had any of this type of food I went with the combo since it appeared to have a bit of everything. Got the double meat. Everything tasted good. But for $14.50 I expected more. Meat had good seasoning. Rice pilaf, I guess that's what it's considered didn't have much flavor. Whatever the sauce was I ended up pouring a bit on. Tasty. All in all not a bad experience. Maybe I'll try and get the hubby to try"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Nice variety, wonderful little eatery area. Take out is a breeze, you can call ahead and they have it ready quickly. The staff are wonderful, too. I used to be an Aladdin's fan until I found them. I'm in love with their sampler, enough food for 2 meals for me. Great prices too."}
{"text":"I have never gotten a meal here that was sub-par, or even mediocre. Absolutely delicious, flavorful food every time, excellent service, fair prices, and a nice, very clean area to sit down and eat (they could definitely ditch the television, though). Started out with regular take-out orders of their spinach and feta pies (how do they make such pillowy soft dough?!), then added the falafel sandwich, beef kafta, and the beef shawarma salad and sandwich to my list of favorites. The manager is a really cool guy - super friendly and open to chatting about business."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price.  I love finding healthy food that's very tasty.  The falafel is seriously some of the best that I've had, the hummus is extremely good as well, and I always steal the rice that my son gets with his dinner.  They use the right amount of garlic in their garlic sauce, which is of course all of the garlic.  Anyways, this is a great local place and it's becoming one of our regular places to eat.  When we can't figure out where to go for dinner we go here."}
{"text":"I used to think Sittoo's was 5 star bc the food is amazing and the people working there were great!  I used to go there a few times a week when I lived close by. 

BUT I was disappointed when I went there recently. My fattoosh salad barely had any salada or dressing on it and they said any more would cost extra. I used to have plenty of tomato and cucumber on my salad without asking, I just assumed that was how items made, delicious! They used to give me extra dressing to take home! It seemed very stingy now.  Smh Sittoo's you've changed!"}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to Sittoo's and have been back more times than I care to say. It's so good, though! I love how fresh everything tastes and I don't feel super guilty about indulging here. 

My favorite thing to order here is the vegetarian combo: hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouleh, grape leaves, and crispy hot falafel served with pita. What's not to love? Everything has great flavor. The falafel comes with a tahini dipping sauce and you can also get a garlic sauce on the side. Trust me, you want it. It's super potent, but you still want it.

I've also tried the shishtawook salad, the shwarma pita, and the kibbie...all fabulous. Everything is made to order, so it's piping hot and crisp when it should be.

The staff has always been quick and friendly. Don't forget to grab a piece of baklava on your way out!"}
{"text":"Don't be scared by the yucky name or the idea that you're eating things you don't know what it is. The food here is great and you can't really go wrong even though you might think the whole idea of eating there is wrong. 

Is it un-American to go here? Not really. Is it weird? Well, think of the things we eat here in this country that are weird. Things like tomatoes and horseshoes. If you tried to feed a horseshoe to someone in Sittooistan they might think it was weird too. Grow up!

I am so tired of people getting all huffy and puffy because people like me want to eat at places like Sittoo's very very occasionally. Isn't this the land of the free? Can't a guy just get him a whatever it is sandwich and enjoy it?

If you're a foodie like me you won't be scared by this place or the name. Besides, they have Coke (was it Pepsi?) as a beverage and that's just as American as getting a hot dog or gyro or what you call it. Don't be a sheep is what I say. Don't be a sheep."}
{"text":"Wow! Called in to order take out, and the total came to $14... is it possible to find a nutritious meal for two at this price? The food was quite good too... we ordered a Spicy Beef Kafta and a Lamb Pita, along with a side of fries and a piece of baklava. The pitas were perfect, just the right size and enough vegetables to verge on the side of healthy(ish). The fries were generous- the two of us couldn't even finish our side of fries. The baklava really was the cherry on top though, perfectly flaky and nutty without being saccharine sweet like most baklava. I also want to mention that the service was excellent, the girl working at the front was extremely sweet and pleasant, definitely added a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in the city! Quick, fast quality food at a great price.  I eat here every other day for lunch.  If you aren't sure what to get, the chicken shawarma wrap with a side of hot sauce is key, along with the tabouli and hummus.  Holla."}
