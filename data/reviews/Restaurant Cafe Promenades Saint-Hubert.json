{"text":"This local diner is such a gem,

We come here often when we don't feel like cooking, it's cheap and it's very good for the price.

The best thing here is the doner pita, it is amazing. The tzatziki sauce is so good, the pita is soft and warm. This is funny to mention but the thing is wrapped nicely, and keeps things from leaking until the last bite. for this alone, it's a ten!! and hits the spots everytime.

We've also had the pizza, burger, lasagna and spaghetti from this place. They taste decent nothing special but the pita is mouth watering!!! It's always cheap here and the waitress is a sweetheart. It takes a bit to get your order so I never come here when I'm in a rush. Oh pita you evil evil thing look at me belly, see what you've done!!!"}
{"text":"Café typique sur Beaubien Est.
Un décor défraichit et une clientèle plutôt âgée qui met dans l'ambiance d'entrée.
Les plats sont classiques mais très bon et surtout pas cher.
Le service est très gentil et familial.
A recommander pour une bouffe simple, économique et dans une bonne ambiance de famille."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this family-run greasy spoon restaurant serving up classics like Club Sandwich, Poutine, Subs, Hotdogs etc. 

The fries are quite good and I've enjoyed all the food I've had here whether it was breakfast or lunch. Decent prices and a classic atmosphere."}
