{"text":"I've been looking for a place in town like this forever! Absolutely authentic. They have the best candies and desserts. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The options are endless, fruit platters, drinks, smoothies. Ohhhhhh the ice cream Chamangos is bomb, watermelon sandia is amazing, or just some sliced mangos omg its all great! I love the watermelon agua fresca too thats my favorite drink so far. Prices are fair can't complain Im just thrilled I found this place"}
{"text":"Love the variety from tostilocos to bionicos. They halve a small seating area but the music makes up for it. Everything is fresh and deliocus"}
{"text":"Place is convenient for me.. I usually stop by for their fruit tray. I haven't had anything else from this place but the menu looks appetizing and the place looks nice and clean. Only thing for me is that as soon as you go inside the smell of that fabuloso (scented floor cleaner) is too much. Everytime i get the fruit i swear i can taste it. I think they need to tone it down a bit and i would go more often."}
{"text":"We got Sandia preparada was really good! It was huge for $12. It includes watermelon bites, mango bites, jicama bites, peanut candy, other candies and a whole cucumber. My friend found this place on Facebook so we all hit it up! It was delicious and perfectly seasoned. BUT there's no table or chair to sit so find a place to eat before you get something huge!"}
{"text":"Their Tostilocos are so good and their close by my neighborhood so it's super convenient. This is definitely a great place to stop by for fruits and ice cream"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican snacks! Everything is made fresh when ordered. My favorite is the Sandia preparada, it's huge and it has a lot of fruit and candy for $12. Prices are reasonable for the portion size. Great customer service. Will be going back."}
{"text":"It's in a bad part of town. As for the service, well...it's not bad, but it's not great. However, the Sandia preparada was as good as it looks. It was worth the long trip to get there."}
{"text":"Best place to get a chamango. I've tried other places but none are as good. The raspados, fruit, ice cream are the best. So delicious!  The staff are so friendly and welcoming. This place rocks."}
{"text":"Great variety and delicious selection of prepared fruit plates smoothies and more. Really enjoy coming here. Service is great considering everything is freshly prepared when you order."}
