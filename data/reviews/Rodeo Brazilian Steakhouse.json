{"text":"I went to Rodeo on Friday as part of winterlicous and found it to be a complete disappointment. The buffet was essentially empty during the entire dinner ( no hot food, bread, cold meats). It was pulling teeth to try and get some steak during the meal, they kept coming around with sausage or parmesan chicken. I was really excited to try Rodeo as I had been to many Brazilian steakhouses in the past, even with winterlicous the meal was $50 (not including alcohol) personally I wouldn't go back and would rather go to copacabana."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day. We all had a great time and enjoyed the food very much. We will come back and recommend to our friends. 

Food: 8/10
Ambiance: 8/10
Entertainment: 6/10 (but they tried very hard and were really enthusiastic with good happy vibes)
Service: 10/10. Here was the home run. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. Goran, the assistant manager did a very good job running this place getting bonus points due to a superb experience. You can tell that everyone was well trained and took their jobs seriously but the authentic smile they had every time they spoke to us and their attention to details was just second to none. 


FOOD. 
The salad bar was nicely displayed with attention to freshness and quality over quantity. They had shrimps, mussels, assorted seafood salads, avocado salad, and a nice selection of fresh salads. 
The meats were tender and not dry. They use a very tasty salt that they import from Brazil. They are so proud of this that Goran actually brought a pack to show us and explained the quality of the food and condiments (even their home made chimichurri uses fresh lemon juice instead of vinegar!)
The side dishes served on the table (fried bananas, sautéed mushrooms and mashed potato) went well with the asparagus and Capri salad.
The flank steak, sirloin and specially bacon wrapped filet mignon were delicious (though some cuts were a little on the salty side)
The Brazilian chorizos were nice and had a nice kick to them. 
The asado (short ribs) were too thin to have a nice grilled taste. They tasted like Korean unmarinated Kalbi. 
The sangria was ok. Actually not bad for canada. The fruits inside (strawberry, blueberry were very fresh)
Tip save some space for desert, the grilled pineapples are nice and if you can try the guaranas (Brazilian pop soda)

SERVICE. 
Any shortcomings in the food or entertainment were more than offset by the service. It is very rare to find an establishment with such friendly staff. The assistant manager Goran 
was very attentive coming to our table several times over dinner to help us with the selection and to explain the various dishes as they came along. Very nice touch like in the old European high end restaurants where the chefs usually come to explain the dishes. You can feel the pride in their food. 

It was my first time here and compared to authentic places in Brazil and Argentina I was satisfied. All things considered they did a very good job and deserve a gold medal!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant last night (Friday) at 7:45pm. We had reservations but might have not needed one as the restaurant still had many open tables. 

A server came over to take our drink orders and to explain how the service worked - we were to get our own sides in the buffet section in the middle of the restaurant and servers would come to our tables with the skewers of meat . He gave us cards - with red writing on one side , and green writing on the other. When we wanted the meat served to us, we would keep the card on the table showing the green side , and flip it to red when we didn't want it coming anymore. 

Buffet sides included various salads, charcuterie meats, cheeses, veggies, sautéed shrimps and mussels. We were also served sides of deep fried banana, fries and rice with beans at the table. 

Meats included bacon-wrapped filet mignon, top sirloin, parmesan chicken, lamb chops, goat, meatballs in tomato sauce and sausages. For dessert, grilled pineapple. 

I liked that there was a big selection in both meats and sides, but I feel like I've had better quality and taste of the meats at other Brazilian restaurants. 

What the restaurant lacked in flavour, they made up plenty with ambiance. There was a live musician singing and playing the guitar. He was even open to taking song requests . Partway through dinner, the staff moved the buffet carts off to the side to make way for some Brazilian dancing. Two dancers put on a show and at one point some of the patrons went to join them on the dance floor. 

The staff were really attentive. They were observant of our water levels and refilled our glasses whenever they got low, without anyone ever needing to ask. When we got the filet mignon, it was a little rare for our liking so we didn't finish it. The server noticed and asked if it was too raw and offered to get us new pieces that were cooked to our liking, again, without anyone needing to ask. 

Overall, the experience was fun. Everyone in the restaurant from the patrons, the staff and the entertainers seemed to be having a great time. 

Dinner was kind of pricey, coming in at about $80 per person with an alcoholic drink."}
{"text":"I've visited Fogo de Chao in San Antonio and San Jose, but I enjoyed Rodeo more. The salad bar is more diverse (I appreciate any place that serves guacamole as a side dish), the meats arrive more frequently, and the chefs pay close personal attention to you. We spoke with him multiple times throughout the evening, and he could name the ingredients in each sauce without any trouble. We also learned that the pao de queijo was gluten-free, if that's a concern. We had some special dietary requirements and all the members of staff were very patient with us. 

If you're worried about noise, just go in the middle of the week. The live band is a weekend thing, and that's when it gets loud. But the food is just as good mid-week, and you'll still have a great time. Ironically, this place is probably great for vegetarians, despite being a Brazilian steakhouse. The salads and side dishes are more than enough to keep vegetarians happy. So, this would be a great spot to bring a group. It's worth the climb up the stairs!"}
{"text":"We had a 8:30pm reservation on a Sat night and we didn't get our table until 9:30. They said that they were behind due to other reservations coming in late so everyone was backed up. The food was not good, either the meat was way over cooked or way under cooked. Glad we tired it but won't be coming back. Copa is on point compared to this place."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant.  Disapointing experience.  This is all you can eat Brazilian steak house.  We came at 8 for dinner on Friday.  The salad buffet was half empty. There were nothing but empty plates and it was never refilled. I felt like we were in cafeteria right before close.   Unless you are a big group, good luck getting meat servers to your table.  We waited almost 20 minutes before I caught the eye of one.  The dinning experience was you get a piece of meat. Eat it and wait 5 minutes than get another and wait.  I filled myself on fries as I was hungry.  They have a show on Friday,  small place so extremely load. I won't be returning. ..EVER."}
{"text":"Over all a sub par experience and nothing like Cococabana ! The host was very unwelcoming from the beginning and seemed quite miserable! She flat out told us we would only have 2 hours as this is all you can eat. She was direct in a no nonsense kind of way which already set the tone for the evening. 

Salad bar was quite limited and not very appealing .. Copacabana has a lot more selection... And better quality!

The meats generally all flowed out at once (at the same time) .. So you could be left without anyone coming to your table for a while. The cheaper cuts were circulated a lot more .. And the meat selection was limited. Eventually all the beef cuts start to taste the same.

Our waitress did not smile once .. And any time we asked a question to the meat cutters they could not speak English. 

An 18% service tip is already tacked on to your bill (even when your a table of 2 people) and when you get the credit card/debit terminal the message \"how much tip would you like to add\" comes up .. Not \"would you like to add a tip?.. Basically your tip has already been charged and they want more tip .. They made it hard to bypass the tip on the terminal there was only an option for % or $.. You had to just hit ok to bypass it. Yes the servers deserve a tip they do work hard .. But im a firm believer in tipping based on what you think the service was worth. The fact that tip is already charged and they trick guests into tipping more leads to the poor service that was received because they know the tip is already coming! 

GO TO Copacabana it really is much better .. We decided we would try this place for something different and really regretted it!"}
{"text":"I had a good time. Our waitress just immigrated from Turkey.  She didn't speak much English but she was nice, smiled and brought us wine! The second floor location tucked in near Broadview and Danforth in the heart of Greek town adds an element of feeling off the beaten path for Brazilian food. The place felt empty although at about half capacity.  I felt like we were at a 3 star all inclusive resort restaurant buffet in Punta Cana. Have I mentioned yet that we had fun and may go again. Food wise, the buffet bar screams international and all you can eat. I had the Chinese shrimp, Japanese sushi, Mexican guacamole, Mediterranean calamari salad, Parmesan cheese from Italy, and Jamaican mango slaw. I washed it down with a Cuban mojito. You see where I'm heading here? 

The meats. Oh the meats.  Keep them coming and they did. Chicken thigh, bacon wrapped stuff, piquante, Parmesan pork, porcheta, lamb leg, flank, sausage, etc. 

We drank, we danced, we watched an incredible Brazilian dance routine. You will too. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We came for dinner for an 8 pm reservation on a Friday night. Yes it was busy and yes we knew it would be as it was Winterlicious. That being said, our group of 9 was ignored for majority of the meal. We were sat in the corner, all the food that came were the end pieces and cold. We had even ordered alcohol with out meal but service was very much sub par. We had to ask for more food and more service constantly. Our group were even told at the end that there was no more food. How do you leave a place like this asking for more food?! We were the last group to leave despite having had asked for the bill a good half hour prior.

Maybe the service is better when it isn't on promotion but don't participate in this promotion if you can't execute the same way you normally would. I would pass on this place. There are better in Toronto."}
{"text":"How can I put it? It's the worst Rodeo experience I ever had. I mean, I was not coming here to eat sausage or meat ball. I know it's restaurant's strategy to feed you some cheap food then you can eat less meat. But this one is overdone. The only two hot dishes at the salads bar were empty all the time. I do not even know what they are serving. Come on, I went to a Rodeo restaurant in Boston last October and my only complaint is the meat come to the table too often. Not to mention, the cooked meat was either too salty or without much flavour. The taste is much worse than a Rodeo restaurant at a all-inclusive hotel in Cancun.  

It's my first time to come to the restaurant and it will be the last. My suggestion is simple: don't go."}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere.  Tons of delicious food options, meat selection is fantastic, and entertainment really makes the experience.  Service has been great every time I've been here.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"If you like to be served once an hour this is the place for you. We asked for medium rare but what we got was either well done or RAW ( not rare, the fat was still white and the meat was mooing and cold) I have been to many Brazilian steak houses before and this is not comparable. 
The waiter and manager did try and rectify the situation but it was a little too late- nothing says delicious than white cold fat. 
The service was very slow and the salad bar was not fresh. Maybe it was because it was winterliscious OR maybe it was because they suck...you be the judge! My verdict: Never Again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Empty salad bar, poor service, meat selection not great and way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Well, to begin - I made reservations for our Anniversary here. I mentioned that when making the reservation as well.

We arrived at 7:50pm, and were seated. There were a few customers, but it wasn't packed on a Thursday night, so good start I thought. Let the dis-appointment begin. You start with the salad bar of course. What was there, was neither fresh, not tasty. I tried it all. The only thing edible was the shrimp.

But thats not why you come to a Brazilian steakhouse, is it - so no big whoop - yet.

The meat service was started very late, and it was SLOW. We waited, and waited, and waited. Even thought there were other customers, we were surprised at how slowly the food came out. When something did come out, you got a fork sized bite, and waited for the next. The food on the spits was barely enough for the five of us at the table, and many times, not all of us received meat, as there wasn't enough on the spit when he got there - even though he came straight from the kitchen!

The quality of the meat? My gawd, what a let down. Dry, dry, DRY, D-R-Y! Not a single piece was juicy. I asked all night for something a little rarer, a little pink, a little more fresh... Didn't happen. The last meat server came with something more raw than rare when I finally respectfully expressed my dis-satisfaction with the waiter. He was very concerned, and caring - but the raw meat was the result. The pork was so dry, it was basically fibre. The chicken, dry  - covered with cheese. The meat, flank, sirloin, garlic beef - all DRY. The only good cut that arrived ONCE, was the filet mignon wrapped in bacon. and you got a fork sized bite of it like everything else. I couldn't believe I was actually hungry at a Brazilian steakhouse! The most enjoyable part of the meal was a canned pop from Brazil called Guarana Antartica. THAT was good.

The capper was after an hour and a half of this non-sense, the waiter was basically asking if we were ready for the pineapple (the ending dish). Well, thats when I let him know how the service was thus far, and I was still hungry?! (thats when the raw meat came out)

I was dis-appointed, and decided it is, what it is. No one even mentioned our anniversary. A little slice of cake, or something to the table would have been classy, seeing as they knew the occasion was special for us. The manager (Gordon) then stopped me on the way out to ask me how everything was (after paying $350 for 2 adults, and 3 kids - one of whom didn't eat any meat) - well, I respectfully told him my thoughts, and issues.

To his credit, he apologised, and offered to comp us another meal next time we were in. He was very proud of the fact they have been in business 16 years, and wanted to make it right. Good on him.

Will offer a followup review when we take him up on that. For now be warned - Copacabana is leaps and bounds better that Rodeo.

******

Update - The manager sort of made good on his promise of a comp: Only for 2 of us, not our kids. Dis-appointing considering how much they could possible consume, given that they are 13, 14 and skinny, and my eldest 16 doesn't like meat, and barely eats to begin with.

Regardless, I gave them another shot (at that price, why not), and the meat was marginally better - because we went at 5:30pm. Obviously - everything was fresh from the grill, and the meat was as cooked as you liked it to be, though taste was still an issue.

Quality was 6 out of 10 at best. Salad bar was still lacking. The service was much better for obvious reasons as well.

Good luck Rodeo - you'll need it."}
{"text":"Great experience! I've been to Copacabana which I thought was amazing but my dinner at Rodeo was so much better! The buffet had many more options and tasted fresher. The staff were very polite and the meat itself was delicious! There was no entertainment when we came which would've been nice but it still didn't take anything away from my experience!"}
{"text":"Worst Brazillian steakhouse. The meat did not taste good at all. The selection was very poor. We went as a group a while back and a lot of us were very disappointed. We will never go back there. Copacabana is WAY better and on a whole increased level of food all together. When we left Rodeo we were still hungry to be honest. When you leave Copacabana, you feel stuffed to the brim and always wish you had room for more.
We found it very odd and frustrating that they would only allow you to eat the grilled pineapple at the end of the meal and not whenever we wanted to. You would never run into this issue at Copacabana. 
I ordered and alcoholic mixed drink and it tasted so bad I asked for the waiter to take it back. He repeatedly asked me what was wrong with the drink and I explained it tasted bad. It's like he did not believe me! several people at our table, as well as me, thought that was purely ridiculous. 
The entire experience was pretty negative and I would never give this place another chance.
The only thing that was actually nice was the entertainment."}
{"text":"Went here during summerlicious.  The food was ok not great.  The meat coming to the table was so slow. Then they wouldn't do anything for my wife who likes her meat cooked closer to well rather than rare.  Most meat was rare.  We had been seated in the corner of the dinning room and the place wasn't very busy but when they came out with their skewers of meat they stop at one or two tables and then had none left and then didn't return with the same meats.  I had to tell the manager in order to get better service.   It was expensive for the way we were treated and what we got.  I think they do it on purpose so you fill up on the salad bar.    I would never go back nor recommend it.   There are much better and friendly Brazilian steakhouses in Toronto."}
{"text":"Skip this place and just go to any Copacabana - better appetizers, way better meat selection and preparation and better atmosphere. It's a shame as this was one of the first, but there are much better options in the city"}
{"text":"This place is a Toronto gem no doubt. An evening here feels like a evening out at a classy Brazilian Resort. It's like a one night vacation.

Polite,  friendly and attentive staff keep the experience moving smoothly. The food is absolutely awesome,  the salad bar alone is well worth the $$$ spent. 

All and all a great night out with awesome food and great entertainment."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment on Friday February 5th in a group of 9. We made reservations for 8 pm and were seated about 20 minutes late though we had arrived on time. From there, the service was almost non existant. It took well over an hour for someone to ask us what we wanted to drink, to explain how the service works (though we all already knew). Our group was seated in a corner, and there never was enough food that would make it to the table. On more than one ocassion we had to flag someone down to ask for water or beverages, and ask them to see if a server could send anyone over with food. 

It took so long to eat that the restaurant basically was closed and our group left unsatisfied. By the end of the night, when we flagged down the servers, we actually had to be told that there wasn't anything left.

The visit also included a show, which was alright, but it was very loud, seemed a bit uncoordinated and unscheduled. They did a pretty good job of getting the crowd to participate. However, please note that while this show happens (which is like 1.5 hours), the salad bar is taken away and our already starving group had no access to salad to tide us over.

I understand that we visited during a high traffic time (during Winterlicious) but if you can't execute appropriately, please don't participate in the event. No one even tried to make the visit better, no apologies no acknowledgement of the issue. 

Also, I know this is standard, but groups 8 or larger are automatically charged a set gratuity which I felt for this visit, was not deserved."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic and delicious! As someone who has been to many Rodizio houses in Toronto/GTA/Niagara this place is the ONLY place that reminds me of those Rio nights (being brasillian and having gone to rio 4 times since 2007) 

The food is perfectly done, if you like well done meat - you need to request it as Brasillian rodizos make a TRUE medium-rare. So delicious and when I compare it to Copacobanna (Woodbridge location) Rodeo is just a cut above. Your not rushed, a charcoal grill taste, great service. The salad bar doesn't come fresher, it may look a bit low on food until you realize they are consistently replenishing everything to keep it fresh. Best Shrimp ever and the best part tort serve everything (I.e rice and beans) in the traditional brasillian way. Copacobanna does not make the food like in Brasil. The dancers are even authentic!!! Beautiful local business. Must try."}
{"text":"Amazing place, amazing service and great people! If you are visiting Toronto this place it's a must to go!"}
{"text":"I arrived with my clients (party of 6) on a Friday night expecting a nice dinner and entertaining show. Unfortunately for us, the entertainment usually consisting of live music, dancers, and capoeira performers did not happen. Not only were we not notified ahead of time, we were charged as though there was entertainment! When I raised my concern with the manager, she brushed it off telling me that the entertainment parties canceled tonight..unlikely...

On top of this, the salad bar was not fresh, the waitress was not friendly,  and the meat was far from traditional Brazilian food. The beans and rice were served cold in a small bowl that looked more like vomit than food.

I am not coming back and I will make sure that no one I know is fouled like I was today, what a rip off! I am so embarrassed to have brought my clients here."}
{"text":"Very unique experience.  
A bit of a slow start.  Hostess didn't really give us a great run down of how it all works.  We started with the summerlicious price.  Very quickly at our table we realized the discounted price also meant a discounted experience.   I really don't know why restaurants do that...I mean the point is to give customers a discounted price so they will try you out.  In the hope that they will come back....so if you give less than your best....why would they come back?  I digress.    

We quickly upgraded to the full experience.  

Salads and antipasto's and sides were really fresh and tasty.  No issues with availability or replenished supply of food.  Omg.   The opposite.   

Meats were generally very very good.  A few that are total misses - chicken parm?   Yuck.  Wrong.  Just wrong.  

Almost everything else was excellent.   

Wine list was ok.  and we found it reasonable.   


Overall. The night was pricey.  But food was very good.  Service was very good.  And quantity was insane.   Meat sweats for about a week following.  Didn't even crave meat for almost a month after.   


Not the kind of place I would go regularly but once or twice a year.  For sure.   Really good experience."}
{"text":"I am a meat lover and a music lover!
I LOVED the show, in my opinion it wasn't lame at all, but full of life, happiness and creativity.
I was a little nervous about the buffet, especially the seafood, but no problems at all!
The grilled vegetables were a perfect complement to the meat.
All the meats were amazing, but I found the garlic beef very salty.
Service was quick and prompt for a busy Saturday night.
The roasted pineapple is a MUST!!
We're coming back!
Vegetarians who don't like loud music/crowds, beware!!"}
{"text":"I went to Rodeo for my office's christmas party on a Saturday night. The food was ok no the best, the service really slow, I don't think this place can handle a big group properly, the juices for mixing beverages were done pretty early, and the waitress forgot about our drinks a couple of times."}
{"text":"This was my second time here.We made reservation for 8pm and got seated right away. It's a great place to eat and have a good time. I looove the entertainment they get 2 thumbs up for incorporating the crowd.The meat, side dishes and salad bar is good. The hot shrimp in the salad bar was out of this world. My experience would've been 5 stars if there was fruit salad :) also the music was a bit too loud when the band was playing."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! We arrived earlier in the evening so no music or any thing playing (I guess it's louder when they are busy)

The waitress was very polite and explained everything clearly on how the place works to the sides she set down in the table.  

Appetizer and salad bar had a nice selection of items.  Everything looked fresh and delicious.  We filled our plates of almost a little of everything. 

On came the meat!!! Everything was amazing we tried almost every thing they brought to us! 

Feeling stuffed we completed our meat feast with grilled pineapple and another side order of fried banana. 

One of the cooks came over to ask if we enjoyed our experience, of course we were full and happy. 

Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"Food 1/10
Service 1/10
Band 8/10

First, all the meat was way over cooked and had a weird smell to it. I think they only used grade A meat at best. Way too chewy and no flavour. The beef had too many big chunks of fat.

The salad bar was mostly empty and for some reason we didn't get any meat for the first 15-20 minutes. 

The wait staff were extremely slow although the place was fairly empty. I ordered some fried bananas  at the end of my meal which took almost 20 minutes to bring out. P.S they came out cold due to the long wait. 

Wait staff never bothered to check in or clear the table at any point during the meal

Although the band was great, I would never come back to this place."}
{"text":"This is the second Brazilian bbq I've been to and I have to say both my S.O. and I agree that this place is better than the more well known Brazilian bbq joint. 

Came here for Winterlicious. All their salads, appetizers and selections were very good and fresh. The bbq was very flavorful and we loved the house Chimichurri (really complements their meats!). My favourites were the chicken thigh, flank steak and the chicken hearts. The porchetta was a fan fave as well. Don't forget about the caramelized pineapple at the end!

Service was really too notch. Very attentive and never left our water empty. If you request something they will come with it momentarily.

The only thing we all found odd was when they gave us some French fries as part of the three plate appetizers.... That just felt totally out of place and random.

Other than that, we highly recommend this place to others!

Food 4.5/5
Service 5/5
Atmosphere 3.5/5 (it was really dark and somewhat loud)
Value 4/5 (yes it is expensive but you really get what you pay for! Well worth it.)"}
{"text":"I just visited Rodeo a few days ago on a Saturday night. It is BY FAR THE WORST brazilian Steakhouse let alone a 'customer service' oriented restaurant i've ever been to. I honestly do not believe some of the reviews below, but late me go straight to the point of why you should NEVER come here. 

I walk in, everything is normal and dandy, it was my girlfriend's birthday and we made reservations, everything was ok so far. Seated down and started eating. The salad bar was..subpar, not many selections, not many chefs refilled the stations so all you get was avocado, kale salad, broccoli and perhaps some left over prosciutto if you were lucky. When the meat came, i was excited.  However the taste, was bland. Most of the meats were inconsistent in terms of temperature. Some hot, some, less. Most of the meats were well done except for top sirloin and steak and cheese those were ok. Most meats need more seasoning.

Here is what really pissed my party off. One of the carvers came in, gave us meat, and spilt all the meat's oil/hot oil all over my girlfriends jacket. He did not apologize, he actually just looked at it and walked away. We complained to the management and she was not very accompanying. She tried to blame us that we should have hung our coats on the coat rack when it was full. (Our server told us that there is no room left on the racks outside).  Most people brought their jackets and put them on their seat. Oil stains do not come out of jackets. She asked me what can she do to help the inconvenience. I asked if she can do something about the bill, she said she cannot comp anything. I responded, 'why would you ask me what I want, if you are going to reject everything i ask'. You should just state to me what you can do for this unforgiving incident. She then tells me that we were given hot water to help clean it off. Sorry but, that doesn't cut it. for $57, i don't want to come into a resteraunt, get shitty ass customer service, on my girlfriend's birthday and watch her scrub off hot meat oil off of her jacket due to the negligence of the meat servers. The manager then also told us that because the jacket, the meat servers need room, so its our fault that we didn't give him space. And to me, thats not acceptable. Our seats were crammed next to a wall and she tried to blame us. Everything i told her we were unhappy about, she tried to reverse it and blame it back on me(us). For a $57.00 per person + tax. We were given very shit customer service, bad manager service, dirty meat oil stains as well as bland inconsistent food.

The meat servers tend to only go to their favorite tables and forget to serve ours. Don't know what was the problem, i had to stick my hand up in the air to try to get everyone's attention to serve us.

I hope everyone sees this HONEST REVIEW. I understand no one is perfect, but the restaurant's poor quality of service is reflected upon the manager who is the blonde heavy set woman usually at the front of house beside the kitchen. She is by far the most unprofessional manager I have ever met. She ended our conversation by saying \"sir, i don't know why you are feeling angry, its just a jacket, our servers gave her water\". I responded, if you dont listen to your customer's experience, you shouldn't be a manager at all period.

Rodeo, i give you 1 star because this won't allow me to give you 0 stars.
$57 + tax for a shit hole service/food. No wonder Copa Cabana has 4-5 resteraunts and you only have 1 but opened way before them. Garbage establishment and horrific manager."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and the food was amazing!  The service was great and we all left very full. I love how they keep coming around with tons of different meats for you to try. I highly recommend this restaurant.

The only fault was the washrooms weren't too impressive and if you have problems walking or are coming with someone in a wheelchair, they won't be able to get to the restaurant. There is no elevator and you have to climb two to three flights of stairs. Allover it was a good experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have done Brazilian Steakhouse at Fogo de Chao in Philly and DC - both have been great experiences and have set the bar pretty high.  While the food was good at Rodeo it just misses the mark on service.

We went this past weekend for our one year wedding anniversary and to take advantage of the Summerlicious pricing.   Some items were not available on the Summerlicious menu (I.e. beef ribs - disappointing for the hubby, who was not appeased by the abundance of chicken hearts - he doesn't do sweet meats :) 

The buffet spread was really good, we had a little of everything.   Grilled veg, assorted cheeses and cold cuts, spring greens, stuffed graped leaves, crisp garlic toast, washed down with Caipirinhias, delish!  

The side dishes of rice and beans and seasoned pota toes were just ok, but the fried banana had a nice crisp coating and was not mushy, and very good.

Now for the meat...it wad perfectly seasoned,  no need to add extra salt or pepper,  and yhe jar of chimichurri on the side was well used.  Meat was also tender and juicy.  On the Summerlicious menu were meatballs stuffed with cheese,  various cuts of beef, chicken, sausage, and as mentioned above an abundance of the \"Brazilian delicacy\" chicken hearts.

The meal was capped off with roasted pineapple with brown sugar and cinnamon,  omg it was so good,  we wanted more, but were too stuffed to eat anything else. 

The evening was soured, however, at bill time.  The website says that it accepts Amex, so we were taken aback when the server refused our card.  They gave us some lame excuse about only accepting it for corporate events.   If that is the case,  then that should be expressed clearly on the website and through signage at the restaurant.  So for that reason alone,  this was our first and last dinner at the Rodeo."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was pretty empty: maybe one or two at the bar and one or two couples here and there. Noticed in the corner there was a big balloon that read \"60\". Turns out a party was coming in later to celebrate someone's 60th.

The lighting is kept low to create some sort of atmosphere I suppose, with small candles at each table. There are some window seats on the side which are quite romantic as you can look out over the Danforth and watch TTC buses roll by.

The server tells you that you can begin with the salad bar, and then the meat will arrive later. He also says you should avoid eating too much at the salad bar to leave room for the meat. Whenever you're ready for the meat, just put in a word and they'll start sending meat over.

Because the restaurant was practically empty, meat just kept coming one after another. Sirloin steak; beef brisket; sausages; pork shoulder; chicken legs, thighs, hearts; leg of lamb, and some others.

One thing I've noticed is that some of the meats are quite dry. Some of them are also quite salty, particularly some of the steak. I liked the lamb and the chicken the most out of all of the options.

Salad bar isn't too bad either, with fruits, raw leafy greens, slices of salmon, shrimp and oysters, and other things.

We finished with the pineapple, which tasted ok. Personally, I'm not a fan of pineapple, but others said it was good.

For a group of 6, auto-grat of 18% was applied.
I think it was an interesting experience to say the least, but not sure if I would spend that much for the kind of meat I got to try."}
{"text":"I came here for a Brazilian friend's welcome back party to Toronto.  If it weren't for my friend, I would not have chosen this location.  

Pros: 
- This establishment has a unique menu of AYCE meats in different cuts, protein varieties, and cooking styles
- On the weekend, you will most likely have a show during your evening meal.  This will include a musical artist and professional Samba dancers.

Cons:
- The price.  After tax and an automatic 18 percent gratuity, the bill came down to about 71 dollars per adult on a Friday night.  This was my biggest gripe with this establishment, as I felt that the quality to price ratio was very off, albeit having a decent performance.
- I found the meats to be extremely salty!
- The servers do not provide readily available non-alcoholic drink menus and you will have to resort to asking them for the price of individual beverages on the fly
- A can of pop cost me $4, which is double the normal market price at most restaurants. Trust me, you will need pop because of all the sodium you will be consuming. 
- They lack a variety of desserts.  They serve grilled pineapple and they have some fresh fruits at the salad bar, but that's it.  
- The audio system did not seem well-tuned or had a poor bass quality"}
{"text":"Our Brazilian friend who has tried her share of Brazilian steakhouses around Toronto and Brazil recommended this joint for its authenticity, live entertainment, and dancing. So we went for her birthday on a Friday night. It was an incredible experience!

Now you have probably heard about the delicious meats they serve to you that has been freshly barbecued on a skewer. These were absolutely delicious with just the right amount of seasoning and cooked to perfection. Just to name a few, they has Parmesan pork, sirloin with cheese, chicken thigh, chicken heart, filet mignon wrapped in bacon (my absolute favourite of the night), pork sausage, leg of lamb, rack of lamb, pork ribs, and beef meatballs with cheese inside. For some of these, you can even select if you want it rare, medium-rare, medium, etc. The buffet station was also very good. I understand that this is \"filler\" in most people's eyes, but the tasty and varied foods made it fantastic! Some highlights include grilled shrimp, steamed muscles, smoked salmon, a ton of pasta and traditional salads, quail's egg, and many types of cheeses.

Reading some other reviews on this place, I can see that some say the meats comes out slow. I would disagree with that because it is not just about the food, but the entire experience. The pacing was great! 

At about 8pm there were also dancers and a guitarist who performed. After a while, they even invited us to join them on the dance floor! They played Brazilian classics like \"The girl from Ipanema\" and others. They even took requests of songs and played them with a Brazilian or latin twist. I never knew \"Hot Line Bling\" could sounds so good with a Brazilian influence! A fantastic experience when you see there is so much more than just delicious foods!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Hard to do a bad Brazillian steakhouse by my standards though  I guess. Its just nice to have one so local. Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"I don't often give a 5/5 review but this place was amazing. The servers were very friendly, the food (all you can eat) was great, the steak was great, the dancing was fun and the entertainers (musician and dancers) were very delightful. 

I went back many times for their cheese and shrimp. They were both simply delicious. 

For 50$ I feel like this is a great way to spend a Friday or Saturday night. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a fun night with great food and tons of enjoyment."}
{"text":"I had chosen to go veggie here as I'm not a big meat eater..not 50.00 worth anyway.  I was impressed with the salad bar...great tasting food with great variety. Spicy shrimp, mussels, cheese, stuffed grape leaves, salmon just to name a few.  I went on a saturday night and  place was very busy and somewhat chaotic and loud."}
{"text":"Visited as a group of 4 on a Friday evening. Although we had no reservations the restaurant was only a quarter full so we had no problem getting a table. The meal is buffet style for the sides, while servers with various meats on a skewer come around to your table and cut slices onto your plate. There were a number of great sides including beat and apple salad, sautéed prawns and a spicy cold pasta salad. The meats that came around were all good and included, beef tenderloin, garlic beef, various sausages, meatballs, beef brisket, chicken heart and lamb chops. The staff were all very friendly and the servers with the meat make it a bit of a show. Following dinner they clear then buffet away and open the dance floor for a salsa performance and then invite patrons to the floor to dance to the live Brazilian music.  Overall a entertaining evening with great food for a moderately expensive $70 with tax and tip. May return on a weekday when the buffer is cheaper."}
{"text":"Was here on a Wednesday evening. Friendly staff and gauchos. All kinds of meats. Every thing was good. Loved the top sirloin. Had Parmesan chicken and pork, wish they made Parmesan steak, too. Anyways had my tummy and heart full and left a very happy man!"}
{"text":"This place was great- awesome buffet, awesome service, yummy meats. A bit pricey, but would recommend."}
{"text":"I was really conflicted about whether to review this place. There were great aspects, but I spent a lot of time being really annoyed with the service and such.

Came here for Summerlicious so it was a MUCH better deal. The $10 price increase on Thursday/Friday/weekends is a bit ridiculous IMO. I don't think I would have paid full price for this.

My main concerns were as follows: the \"\"\"entertainment\"\"\" was EXTREMELY loud, full of cringeworthy white people dancing, and added nothing to the experience. I would never come back on a night with the show. The hostess was very short with us and we got the feeling she was not paying attention to what we said (even things like the name the reservation was under). The main thing is that the service was SO SLOW OH MY GOD. I know they want you to fill up on the appetizers. I understand that. This was unbelievable. Let me tell you about it.

They seriously didn't even give us the red/green coasters until about 10 minutes after our whole party was seated. They took about 10 more minutes to bring out the fried bananas and French fries. They didn't bring out any meat until probably 15-20 minutes after that. The meat MAYBE came out with 1-2 people every 5-7 minutes. Every time, I swore that I would get 6 or 7 pieces to tide myself over. Every time, the person carving the meat rushed through serving my (large) table and didn't give me as many pieces as I wanted. It was a battle to get more than one piece for anyone.

Why 3 stars, then? The food. The parmesan chicken was heavenly. I'm still thinking about the sirloin, with its delicious fat cap, more than a week later. The pork shoulder was a solid, meaty meat. The least impressive thing was probably the dessert pineapple - would have liked it to be more caramelized.

Would I come back? I would look at other Brazilian steakhouses first, and I definitely wouldn't come back when they had live entertainment.

Note: the restaurant is up a flight of stairs and not accessible. Would have liked to know that."}
{"text":"Have been here four times and each time I'm amazed by the experience. The appetizer buffet is a meal on it's own. The skewers of delicious meats come in waves. The sides are fantastic - deep-fried bananas and fries are great. And to cap it off, grilled pineapple that melts in your mouth. All courses are endless and so very tasty.
And if you come on a Fri. or Sat. night, then you have fun entertainment too!
The only danger is that you'll eat too much and burst!"}
{"text":"Originally had decided to go to the Rodeo on Friday but our plans changed so we went on Sunday instead.  Unfortunately there is no entertainment on Sunday but the music played in the restaurant was good.  Wait staff was amazing and always made sure we had what we needed.  My only complaint is the place lacks wall decorations.  So much wall and no type of art work.  We took a picture and, although we looked good, the blank walls behind us were crying..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. I found all of the food delicious and the servers were very pleasant and accommodating. They came around with the various roasted meats frequently and everything I tried was delicious. I particularly liked the pork with parmesan roast. They bring some sides to your table and you are also free to visit a buffet-style side-dish area with different kinds of pasta, salads, vegetable dishes, cheeses, and seafood. Everything I tried from the buffet area was delicious. 
The only downside to this place for me was the price, which is probably worth it considering the quality and amount of food you get, but just kinda expensive for me (came to $66 for dinner with 1 glass white wine after tax and tip), so I would save it for a special occasion.
Would definitely go again and would definitely recommend for a memorable dinner out!"}
{"text":"Loveeeed it here! Delicious food and lovely entertainment. The toasted pineapple is a must. Prices are a bit on the pricey side - $50/person - but totally worth it. Would go back and would recommend :)"}
{"text":"I love this place.
Came here as part of company Christmas party - Although I have been wanting to come here for a while!
Food is amazing - the steaks and all other sides are delicious. 
Service cannot get any better. & very entertaining and creative way.
The entertainment is also really good.
I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"If you are a meat loving carnivore, it's worth a try there aren't to many Brazilian Rodizio around town.  
The meat selection seem to be standard and it taste great.  The staff were nice and friendly, if you have had enough meat hit then salad bar quiet a good selection beside salad there was steam mussels, shrimp, cold cuts and cheeses any many more."}
{"text":"only two words can describe my experience MEAT OVERLOAD.

This hidden meat heaven is hidden away on Danforth just below a dance studio which is ironic since you'll need to hit the gym assuming you wake up from your Meat coma.

The restaurant has a dark intimate setting but gets lively with life music and dancing. They have a modest salad bar was available and was enough if you wanted a break from the meat.

And now the meat, with a selection of meats ranging from Steak, Prime Rib, Parmesan encrusted pork loin to chicken kidneys they have any meat imaginable served on a stick which they shave on directly on your place so the meat doesn't dry out or go cold. The best dessert was the Roasted Pineapple, coated in brown sugar and cinnamon the pinapple was roasted until it  had a crunchy crust and was tender enough to cut with a fork. It still haunts me in my dreams.

My only complaint is the fact that the servers come way to slow. You would be waiting awhile before a server comes to you for more food which could be a blessing in disguise depending on how you look at it."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  I came here during summerlicious for my birthday dinner and had a blast. Amazing food was all around me...at the self-serve station and from the waiters that walked around with sword-like instruments filled with delicious meats. 

The variety of delicious BBQed and grilled meats was staggering and each piece was delicious. As for the self-serve section that mussels and shrimps were the stars. You have to keep an eye out for when they replenish them b/c they empty out fast.

This is one of those places that you have to bring out of towners to and probably only for special occasions."}
{"text":"Best Brazilian Rodizio steakhouse in Toronto.  The others are not close.  The shrimp at the appetizer station is better than most shrimp you pay for at other places, and it's included in your meal.  Most of the meats are very flavourful.  The pineapple with cinnamon at the end is del"}
{"text":"Omg! What a horrible experience! Lets start off saying I love the Brasa, Copacabana and also visit Touro regularly. Thought I would give Rodeo a try. Made a reservation for Mothers day. 

The worst decision of my entire life! Half of the buffet offerings were empty (don't fall for the pictures) the entire time we probably got to try 5/6 cuts of meat. Most of the time we had to wait along time for meat to come around. When they finally came meat was overcooked. We had to request medium rare to more than 5/6 times to the servers then we finally got frustrated and told the hostess. By then we already lost appetite. In the beginning of the meal we requested for salmon and throughout dinner. It never came. The only thing which was yummy were the shrimps. 

The server promised us mushrooms which never came either. When I made a request for the garlic beef the server blatantly told me 'no'. Most of them were rude and miserable. 
Honestly for the price this place is a total scam. Food failed, service failed. The serves finally decided to offer us fresh plate when we asked for the bill. 

Btw i enjoyed the effort for entertainment! But it was too long. We couldn't hear one word thought dinner. Music was so loud our ears were buzzing. I think they purposely do it so u wont stay for long and just give them the money and leave."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my wife there and both of us found the quality of the meat served not acceptable. The meat was dry, hard and it tasted bad... Like it was boiled or left out of proper refrigeration (I don't know if that's is the case but it sure tasted funny). The Music is also too loud and you have to yell to make yourself heard. Although the service tried to compensate it was not enough for stopping me to write this review. I expected more from a $50 per person + drink type of restaurant..."}
{"text":"This review is tough for me to write because I have mixed feelings about this place.

Here's why. I took my friend here for her birthday on a Friday because i knew there was live music and entertainment. I made a reservation online for 7pm but they didn't have it so I made it for 7:30pm. When we got here, it was pretty empty so I feel you can email or call them directly to get the reservation you want as online may not be 100% accurate.

The restaurant is pretty big. We were greeted by the server right away and he took us to a table. He explained that we can go eat at the salad bar and within 15 minutes, he will give us two cards to get served meat or fish. The salad bar was filled with a variety of things, but some of the dishes were a bit empty and needed to be refilled. I really enjoyed the grilled red peppers and sautéed mushrooms. The smoked salmon was also pretty good. I didn't like the mussels because they were dry.

Within 15 minutes, we got the cards. Green is go for food and red is stop. We could put red and take a break and gather more food if we desired.

We got to taste beef, pork, chicken, salmon, lamb and sausage. They had a lot of meat with cheese, which was delicious. My fave were the chicken (so tender and melt in your mouth), beef and cheese, pork and cheese, and beef sirloin. I found the salmon too dry and sausage was too tough. They also brought over cheese bread (delicious), bean and rice, fries, and fried banana. 

The live music started around 8:00pm and there was two live dancers that danced Brazilian around 8:30pm. It was awesome Spanish music. The dancers walked around to take photos with folks and invited us to the dance floor to dance. It was super fun and entertaining. The dancing was a good way to relieve my stomach of all the good food! The entertainment would start and go on for about 15 to 20 minutes and then there would be a break and music and dancing again until 11pm.

I got their most popular cocktail, which was pretty strong. I liked it.

Once we were done, we got brown sugar cinnamon pineapple for dessert. It was sweet and crunchy.

We had a blast and I was super impressed with the food. I had low expectations because some reviews indicated that the food wasn't good but I was genuinely surprised. Most of the meats were so tender, flavourful, and soft. It was pretty greasy though, but that's what made it so yummy. 

I was super prepared to give this experience a 4 star..... but.....

This may be TMI, but both me and my friend got massive diarrhea right after. At first I thought it was cause I'm not used to greasy food, but then when my friend told me that happened to her too then it's making me concerned that maybe the food wasn't fresh or clean.  I don't normally have issues with food so this was pretty disappointing. I honestly had such a great time that I wanted to go back but I'm a bit worried about the food now. I really want to give this place a 4 cause we did have a blast. The entertainment alone is a 4! The singer and dancers were awesome.

The bill for 2 with one cocktail and 18% came to $161. Pretty pricey but it is fun if I didn't get sick after."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and had a great experience. The food and drinks were delicious, with a great atmosphere. All the meat servers were fantastic and super friendly, but our main server was hard to find and seemed to avoid eye contact with tables, focusing only on one table. We had to wait a while to get our bill from another server nonetheless, and even during payment she was nowhere to be found. Other than her everyone and everything else was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Rodeo on a Saturday night. We chose the Summerlicious option, which has fewer options than the regular menu, but we still left quite stuffed. 
We started with drinks (diet coke for my cousin and a very good mojito for me) then chose items from the salad bar. The salads were fresh and a good alternative to the tons of meat that we had. 

We really enjoyed the meats. The entertainment (a band and dancers) were great. They got many people up onto the dance floor."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Rodeo. Four kinds of meat: beef, chicken, pork & lamb. We loved the aged rib steaks, cheese biscuits, salads, mussels, roasted pineapple & banana fritters. It was a tsunami of meat because the servers keep coming. The owner/chef even came to our table.
It was a wonderful meal & memorable experience."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, heard great things about this place so I wanted to check it out for myself. Lucky for me they were apart if the summerlicious event. They were so booked up and busy but I managed to get a reservation for 3 on Saturday night at 9:30.

My sister and I arrived 15 mins prior to our reservation. The hostness said our table wasn't ready yet and if we could just take a seat at the bar until then. Lucky for us their weekend live entertainment was starting :). They had a in house band come out and got everyone in the mood and into the music. Then came the very beautiful Brazilian dancers and the capita dancers. Awesome live entertainment this went on till about 11pm. Fair warning it's super loud, y?u can't talk much during live show

They get us seated at 10pm, we get a table right next to the stage. It was pretty loud so we couldn't hear each other or our waitress. Our poor waitress had to kinda talk really loud over music but she was really nice about it tho. 

So how it works there is you get a card one side is green to let them know you're  still eating and the red side is to let them know you're done eating. They give you a few small sides like rice, fried banana, sautéed mushrooms and veggie. They also have a good selection from the salad bar to choose from lettuces, pastas, beans, veggies, smoked salmon."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here, suppose its time to officially write a review. Please note that I've been coming here only on the -licious events, more details below. 

The store is located up a set of stairs and through a candle lit corridor where the host would show you to your seat. I quite appreciate the cleanliness and setup of the tables, uniforms of the servers and lighting. 

The server showed us where to get our own appetizer on the center floor where you can choose between many different types of salads, cold cuts, mussels, smoked salmon. My favourites here are the avocado salads and the mango salads which both tasted nice and refreshing. I knew I would be down to eat alot of meats so be prepared to down some salads ahead of time. The smoked salmon and capers were better than the grocery store quality I feel. 

Finally the server brought a plate slider with chimichurri sauce (yum), rice/bean mixture, fries and the amazing deep fried banana which I asked for seconds - they're perfectly fried with a crispy outside and a sweet gooey center. 

The rotations for the cuts of meats that came last Wednesday night consisted of: top sirloin(alright), garlic beef (good), chicken wings (meh), sausage (meh), chicken parmesan (no). 

I was hoping for more garlic beefs but they didn't come more than twice. However nearing the end of the night there was a new couple that came and the server quietly brought up a skewer for them which carried fillet mignon. We quickly asked for some and he quickly brought it back to the kitchen afterwards. 

The fillet mignon was wrapped in a layer of bacon. It was quite good but I felt that the fat and salt from the bacon was abit overwhelming and the meat was not as tender as I hoped. Overall strong flavours but there was hint of overpoweredness from the salt and oil. 

Finally the pineapples.. They're to die for. Yes yes and yes. Such a simple dish and they have mastered the perfect combination of sugars and cinnamon to make it taste just perfect! 

Overall price after tax and tips for two comes down to $100 for winterlicous - note that they automatically put up the tax and tips. Which I feel is fair since the servers do have to come make many trips. They're always happy to serve you foods too. Definitely a 10/10 for the service every time. I even remember the time 2 years ago where they had a dance performance in the middle of the room. 

However I have to dock down a couple stars this time as the selection of meats on the Wednesday night was very lacking. Perhaps there are better selections on the weekends or busy nights.

Also they don't accept Amex :(."}
{"text":"My family took me here for my birthday on May 19th and we really enjoyed our time here 
Our server Sunni was SO nice and really bonded with you by remembering our names as she addressed us everytime she came to our table. 
She was funny too! 
Always had a smile on her face and including the other waiter was very friendly as well!
They really made sure our time here was a good experience 
The entertainment and atmosphere was amazing !
If anything I want to give a tip; if your crowd person like me, 
Well We had reservations for 7pm but got there early at 6:30 and so there were not a lot of people in the restaurant. At first it felt pretty empty to me.
Well I worried for nothing because 
As soon as 7pm rolled around? people came in groups for there reserved tables so it was packed in no time and just in time for the dancers to come out for 7:30 to entertain 
Half an hour made a difference obv :)
So ya I'm confirming 7pm on time is the best for reservations ;) and around 8:30pm I believe? They move the buffet cart to the side so the dance floor is available but I like they don't take it away completely or anything so we can still help ourselves to more food if we want.
Oh and the Food was amazing !
Made just right and not too salted AT ALL
Depends I guess on the person maybe? But we never had an issue
Meat was cooked the way we liked it and not dry
The buffet was very good selection too
I suggest experiencing this place for yourself
It was a lot of fun :)"}
{"text":"Food was terrible. 
The buffet shrimps were not fully cooked. Most of the meat were dry and tasteless. They used not ripe pineapple for the grilled pineapple and it tasted so sour.
Go to copa cabana and get way better food and service for cheaper price. 10/10 wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"If u like meat this the place to be. We celebrated a birthday about 10 of us. We got seated right away and was able to go to the buffet table. The mushrooms and shrimps were good. But the best part was the meat. We ate until we were in a trance. But u have leave room for fried bananas and grilled pineapple. Great food and very nice service."}

{"text":"I have been to Rodeo Brazilian twice now; once last year (see original review 2/1/16) and once Dec 2016. Sadly there was a huge difference in quality that prompted me to write a follow up review.  On our first visit everything was perfect; in describing the experience to friends I compared it to other locations I had visited in Niagara Falls, New York, North Carolina etc., and went so far as to say this was maybe the best one yet. Not so much on my most recent trip. 
The problems started with the Pao de Queijo, those heavenly little lighter-than-air cheesy puff balls of goodness. I love those things. Imagine my disappointment when they were leaden, thick, heavy, and every single one of them was burnt black on the bottom, even the additional ones we requested in the hopes that they'd be better. There were no yummy garlicky mashed potatoes or sauteed mushrooms, sadly, just the fried bananas, some french fries, and rice/grains stuff. Next was the service. It was decent last time, but this visit the hostess seemed to think it was a burden to acknowledge people and answered two telephone calls before addressing us, and there was a notable inattention to drinks etc. This I could deal with, if the meat had been the same amazing quality as last time, but no. The only thing that was palatable was the first item brought to us, never to be seen again, a delectable little lamb chop. Everything else was substandard; flavoring was off, steaks were overcooked, there was none of that melt-in-your mouthness that made our last trip so memorable. Where was that write-home-about porchetta?! Even my 8-year old commented that the meatballs didn't taste as good, and wouldn't touch the french fries. It was a very quiet slow night, surprising for the Friday before NYE, but the meat still should have been flowing.

Kudos to the gentleman who was making drinks and making sure customers were taken care of (a manager? owner? helpful bartender?). He was very pleasant and sincere, and that was appreciated. However, we will not be returning until I hear that additional changes (for the better) have been made.

1/5/17 - Update - The helpful bartender/manager called me himself to apologize and asked us to come back and give them another chance. I was incredibly impressed by this personal touch and attention to his clientele. Jenny and I will definitely be taking him up on his offer, and I look forward to writing a happier update after!"}

{"text":"First time eating here on valentine's day with the boyfriend. It was an interesting experience, as in never been to a place that serves meat on sticks. We had reservations at 7 and we got a seat almost right away despite having to come 10 mins early and it being a busy night. As we got seated, the waitress told us we only had 1 hour to eat which didn't bother me at first. Service came often in the beginning then gradually got slower and eventually came to a halt by the end. We got full from all the meat within 40 minutes of our dinner and then we waited for someone to clear our table for dessert for over 20 minutes. We had to flag one of the meat carriers down to tell him we were ready for dessert. At this point I told my boyfriend that if they tell us to speed it up during our dessert, I would complain about their service, but they didn't. 
Overall it was a good night, the live band cheered me up as they played Roxanne and hot line bling bachata style."}
{"text":"Good food live entertainment. Tip: bring earplugs .. Really loud. I'm here right now and can't hear the people next to me so I'm yelping instead. A little pricy too"}
{"text":"My only experience prior to visiting Rodeo was going to Copacabana a few times, which I loved. My boyfriend took me here very recently, and I can't say I would want to go back.

I found the selection at the salad bar kind of weak..there was one of those metal things that warms food inside (what IS the name of those things?!) that was fully empty. I mean don't get me wrong, I love meat, but I don't want my sides to also be..meat. 

I also found that the servers with the food came around TOO often. As in we would have just said yes to something and another server would be right behind them. I'd literally have food in my mouth! 

However when we went to pay, when keying in the tip information, I must've made a mistake and put a low amount..but on the way out of the restaurant, the server came around and said \"is this what you wanted to tip..? It's kind of low\" and then awkwardly stood there while I THEN DEBITED ANOTHER AMOUNT for a tip. I felt really uncomfortable and kind of pressured. What if I HAD intended to leave that tip? 

Anyways, I can't say I'll be headed back there, solely for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Just got home from my visit to Rodeo Brazilian Steakhouse with the boyf & my mom who is visiting from out of town, and, although the food was mostly delicious, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with my visit to Rodeo Brazilian Steakhouse. I should preface this by saying that I live within a stone's throw of Copa on Eg, but chose Rodeo based on the Yelp reviews and because they have farofa (cassava flour) on their rice & beans. I LOVE farofa.

I made a reservation earlier in the week for Friday night, fully ready for/forewarned about the loud entertainment and dancers, which, I will add, they also tout on their website. In fact, we were excited for it. To our surprise, their was no entertainment when we got there, but okay, maybe we're a little early (7:30pm reservation). After I asked a waiter who was unsure of where the band was, the manager said 'the band cancelled... I don't know where they are.'  Ok? I understand shit happens, but then we were charged full price for the meal (usually $40 Sunday-Wednesday, it's $50 on Thursday-Saturday, which I assumed was to help pay for the 'Big Brazilian Show'). Something about that just didn't jive with me at $60+ per person for what was supposed to be a special treat featuring live entertainment. Perhaps I should have expressed my disappointment instead of simply asking twice, but I'm rarely one to make a stink.  If they knew the entertainment was going to cancel, they might have called those with reservations to let them know. If not, they should have offered the meal at the non-entertainment price so that guests don't have to awkwardly ask for a discount for a service that was not provided.

With that said, my favorites: the caipirinhas, fried banana, rice, beans and farofa, and, bizarrely, the meatball. It was amazing!!
Meh: The turkey wrapped in bacon was a little dry, as was the lamb"}
