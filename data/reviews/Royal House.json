Good quality dim sum in a good eating environment.  Not crammed up and loud like others."}

All cost $23.75 for 2 persons. So disappointed!!  Shrimp dumpling is smaller than other restaurant, steamed chicken feet is 'strange' taste w/ special sauce and steamed glutinous rice is dry and not sticky. We won't come back again."}

Very fresh seafood and delicious Peking duck during dinner 

Owner is very nice"}
{"text":"Oh man best dim sum place I have had so far! First time ever that I have had Har Gow which did not fall apart! 

Reasonable pricing too! given the quality of the food I was surprised that this specialty spot could keep its prices comparable to other dim sum joints =)

Definitely enjoyed the service, and will be returning with my parents! (don't have to cover the bill XD)"}
{"text":"I went to the royal teahouse for lunch today.  It was by far the worst dim sum I have ever had.  All the dishes I ordered tasted the same, with the same odd spice used in everything leaving a really bad aftertaste.  

It was riduculously expensive.  $24 for 4 dishes.  2 of which were totally not what I was even expecting....but still had to pay anyway.

I piece of advice......stay away."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience at this restaurant last night, stay away! Total nightmare!

We order a regular 10 dishes package and we even went to the restaurant the night before to pre-order their famous sticky rice chicken. We came here for dimsum a couple of times at lunch, we figured their dinner quality would still be quite nice - unfortunately NOT!

The dishes came out SUPER slow, took almost 10 to 15 minutes for each dish to come out. It became very hard to eat because basically you only have one dish at a time with rice. Also, you would expect when you order the peiking duck the cabbage rolls usually come out next, but ours didn't. Actually it came out an hour after we have finished our duck, which totally defeats the whole atmosphere of eating peicking duck!

Moreover, can you believe their famous sticky rice chicken came out RAW?! Who in the right mind would give their customer RAW chicken. Does the chef not check the chicken after cutting it? We almost ate it if we didn't check first.

To compensate for their mistake, the restaurant said they would give us a new sticky rice chicken, only to find out they microwaved it which totally defeats the purpose. Then they apologized again, gave us another chicken dish except this time our chicken was burnt. 

All in all - poor quality, poor management, and poor chef. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Dim sum is good. Place is busy. Would recommend however food took over 20 mins to arrive and they forgot about providing us tea until I asked. No, before 11am special"}
{"text":"There was a review on 4/12/18 which noted that the Early Bird Special was $3.08 for S/M/L.  Visited this place on 4/16/18, and guess what - they changed the Early Bird price to $3.10, or 2 cents more!  With any price change, they had to reprint all the order forms, as well as the laminated menu on each table.  I don't know how many Early Bird dishes they sell in a day, but to go through the expense of printing new menus just for 2 more cents per dish is strange, to say the least.

The food quality, taste, and presentation was ok.  Nothing sticks out in particular, which is good in a way.  What is readily apparent though is that regular customers receive a higher level of service and better attention than that of new customers.  To each his own then.  There are many other dim sum choices near the area."}

Great service, servers here are very kind.

Saturday and Sunday have 2.60 per dish till 11:00am."}

{"text":"I like Chinese tea, Chinese tea for me.
This is one of my favorite dim sum spots.

What makes this dim sum place better than others?
*Clean: This place is nice enough to take your non-asian friends. 
No giant rats or dudes picking their noses as they scoop your congee.

*Tasty and fresh: Food is well prepared. 
Speedy preparation and they have some items that I don't find too much elsewhere. 
I always order the spicy deep-fried eggplant. It's tempura style, crispy with a kick..  
The Portuguese chicken tarts/pies are magically savory and sweet.
The sponge cake... it's so cute! They roll them up...sort of like little cinnamon buns.. if my grandma were trying to make them.

*Order by checkbox: I know that people like the pushy-cart thing... 
but I like getting food when I'm hungry. 
And getting the food I want and not having to wait for it.  
I don't feel I should suffer for my food.  It doesn't make it more enjoyable.  

Anyways, I love this place!! :)"}
{"text":"Service: 1 star
Food: 4 star

Dim Sum is pretty decent for the price you're paying. Depending on what you order the food is hit or miss however things did come out pretty quick! We ended up paying $70 for 7 adults and we were left stuffed to the brim. It gets really crowded however, and the waiters walk dangerously close to your head (no joke, my dad got knocked in the head with a tray full of food). 

Service is an absolute joke here. They don't care if you had a reservation - we had to wait half an hour (plus) for a table. Also, their inner doors are an absolute joke - it doesn't keep the wind out. If you have kids or elders, ask to be seated far away from the doors! Once you're seated though, service is decent enough (compared to the initial service you receive when walking though the door). However, we did have to flag down multiple servers multiple times to ask for the small things. 

The service was an absolute deterrent even though the food was good - just not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"First and possibly last!  Yelped it and figure why not $2.80 all dishes before 11am. We sat down at 1030am, confirmed with 2 staffs regarding their special. Until the bill arrived and still getting charged with regualr price. Dislike the \"not so honest business\". Make sure you review your bill. You can only pay cash with if you want the special before 11am. 
Food quality was \"okay\", 3/5 
Service 3/5
Seater Greeter 0/5 \"pure rudeness\" :/ 

Ps: remaining pieces of bone in the chicken chives dumpling, and a souvenir from the chef his \"hair follicle\" inside the fried eggplant."}
{"text":"Okay restaurant for Chinese food and Dim Sum. I really only come for dim sum when my friends ask. Compared to other restaurants they have a smaller dim sum menu and no speciality items that only they have. They're early bird prices are around $2.50 per dim sum dish (small, medium and large) before 11:30 am (weekends are 11am).

Since I've only tried their dim sum i can only comment on that. It's alright, nothing special but not bad to eat at but could try."}
{"text":"Poor service, decent food, good location. Didn't know a place like this existed until today. 
The food was mediocre, nothing stood out too much in terms of their dimsum. Nothing was terrible either, safe bets are chicken feet, dumplings, siu mai, congee. They did have something very new and interesting - a durian pastry!! I haven't seen that before at dim sum places. It was averagely priced but I would say their service is not that great. They do however have a service button which does eliminate long waits. The longest wait for us was when we got the bill and was waiting for the change... Didn't want to press the service button for that lol."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out a new dim sum place, since a lot of them have been feeling the same for me lately. Overall, this place does have a better menu than most, but with a more interesting menu comes an increase in average price as well, since the unique items also use pricier ingredients (so very few s items, mainly m,l xl, or sp). Food is alright, Some items, like the chicken feet are quite yummy, while the baos in general seem to be really disappointing with a tough dough and minimal filling. Service wise is quite polite. They forgot our tea, but kept apologizing about it whereas the typical waiter at a dim sum restaurant would have just been like, \"oh..ok, here it is\" and walk off. However despite their politeness, servers are still quite slow, which I can forgive if he place was packed, but there were only 5 tables, so we shouldn't have strained ourselves as much as we did to ask for the bill. Overall, an alright dim sum place, but certainly not some where to go go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and brief.

We came here because \"Casa Victoria\" was packed and decided to try something new and stumbled to Royal Teahouse. We usually prefer \"Ginger and Onion\" however being a Sunday weekend and mid-afternoon, we didn't even bother because it's most likely busy.

We ordered our favourite dishes of Fung Tsow (steam chicken feet), Ngau Bak Yip (steamed beef tripe), Siu Mai (pork and shrimp dumplings), Har Cheong Fan (shrimp rice roll), Arp Jeung (steamed duck fee) and Seen Juk Guen (bean curd roll) The food was over salted (almost every dish) and lacked flavour. It was edible but not the best we've had comparing to dim sum restaurants in Markham.

Price was dim sum range, not expensive but I wouldn't pay to eat salty dim sum. Money isn't an issue if you have good quality food. We didn't even finish our dim sum and waitress seems offended that we didn't take it to go. Just wasn't good."}
{"text":"We came here for weekday dim sum. The parking was pretty difficult to find since it's shared with other stores in the plaza.

As for the environment, it was not too great. The service was alright and the food was pretty good. I recommend coming here before 11 am (come extra early if you don't want to fight for a parking space) to get the discount on the dim sum. Overall, great place for the food, not so good for the service and environment."}
{"text":"Pretty much average dim sum, nothing to write home about.

Royal tea house isn't too royal after all, like many have reviewed already the dim sum is 'decent', which is true. But service is a bit slow and as expected with most dim sum places, in attentive. Hard to wave down a waiter or waitress. You really gotta try pretty hard and fight their attention.

To be fair, I would normally give it 3 stars for the food since the dim sum is decent but because they missed my order and don't event seem to care. Terrible service, you can't expect good service at dim sum places but this place is definitely below par. 

Do not plan on returning.

Edit: to top it off in now dropping this to one star, not only did they miss our order which we asked about 3 times and they still missed it. After asking 3 times they told us it's sold out! What a joke, could've told us when we asked about it the first time, really disappointing to say the least. Wow"}
{"text":"Customer service at its worst!! Came here to celebrate Dad's birthday: reserved a table but when we arrived the table was not available, had to wait 30 min before being seated, then it took another full hour and only after repeatedly complained that we were served with complimentary soup (without spoon?!). Food was decent but would not recommend Peking duck. This restaurant is seriously understaffed; waiter/waitress were running around like chicken without heads."}
{"text":"First impression of this place was already bad. There were multiple cups that had food remnants on them and so I had a bad feeling about it...

Food was okay but fast forward to the chicken buns-- there was a BUG between the bun and the paper that goes under each bun. Made me lose my appetite.... never coming again."}
{"text":"Lost our order. No apologies. We didn't get any dim sum until almost an 1hr later. we almost walked out. Dim sum is meh. I wouldn't come here again"}
{"text":"2 words, ****ing sucks.  

I went to this place for dinner the other night with a party of 7 and the waiter hid all the \"better value\" menu from us.  Instead he forced us to order the crab and lobster dinner when all we wanted was a casual meet and greet dinner. 

So the dishes came, and it didn't taste horrible, however for that value you're better off going to fisherman's clubhouse and getting a 8lb lobster than having some crummy 4lb crayfish.

Honestly steer clear from this place.  Dishonest, and subpar food - the two things I hate."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad! We had the usuals and everything came out nice and hot!!! We have a 10% card so that made the meal even more sweet! Bring cash, if you have a discount card!"}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum!
I've been coming here for years and the food is consistently good.  Nice selection of food and reasonably priced.
Unfortunately, not everyone speaks English very well, so I sometimes have to find someone I know if I'm asking something specific.  Otherwise, the service is adequate.

I do like that the menu is on a paper slip that you fill out.  It makes trying to communicate what you want a bit easier and you don't feel that communication barrier as much.

Overall, I love the food and can get by with the language barrier.  If you know what you want, it's definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I didn't like this restaurant at all.  I had high hopes for Royal House because it was one of those relatively unknown Chinese restaurants in the Markham area that I hadn't heard much about before.  I was hopeful for this restaurant to be a good one so that I could return in the future since it was located so close to me.

We got there early on a Sunday morning at 9:30 a.m.  There were already a lot of people dining in for dim sum so we got one of the tables closest to the doorway before a line-up started.  The wait for early morning dim sum had begun!

The first thing I noticed was that their cups and tableware were a little grimy.  The cups didn't seem thoroughly washed; I could see some food stains on the cups.

While the food was mediocre for the most part and wasn't particularly outstanding, what was etched in my mind was the fact that I found A), a piece of small tiny plastic in my food; it was the cheung fun.  Ugh.  B), a short piece of hair embedded inside the \"Buddha's Delight in Dried Bean Curd Roll\".  (I only discovered this because the bean curd roll was split in half to share with my mom and I ate the second half....  if we hadn't split it open apart and one of us ate it whole, we probably would never have discovered the hair... other than feeling it while chewing inside the mouth.  ICK.)  So much for being a vegetarian dish too...  I picked out the hair.  I don't like hair in my food...

So, even though the meal itself was fine and the prices reasonable, I don't want to return again.  They don't seem very clean."}
{"text":"It's not often I will have dim sum for the morning specials but I really do enjoy it.  It was the first time my wife would join myself and my friends for an early Sunday morning get together as well.  Royal House is tucked away in a strip mall that doesn't face the main street (Woodbine) that also has other restaurants and small businesses.

Honestly the store front looks small but the place opens up to a large dining area which also has a banquet room and larger group tables towards the back.  Our table was a table for 6 but the larger ones which could seat 8, 10 or 12 all had lazy susans for spinning around those plates for sharing.

The place opens at 9am but I arrived at 945 in order to meet friends that were going to be coming for about 10 or so.  We ended up getting the table because I had a feeling this place would get packed within an hour and as it turns out I was right.  We were sitting for a while being the first ones there and we were brought a pot of tea and one of the servers asked us if we wanted some pork buns while we were waiting.  They looked pretty good so I said sure.  When he went to mark it on the sheet it wasn't on the menu so he had to go by just writing it on the menu check list.  

For those that aren't sure how some places do their dim sim, this place lets you use the \"check boxes\" to select what you want to order and how many.  They then take that sheet, print off a list of all the items and then as they bring it to your table they cross the items off that list until the list is completed.  Plates come in waves, so it's not like you get everything at once but rather one or two at a time depending on when they're made.  Depending on how many people you have you will want to order accordingly.  Small plates normally have smaller servers while the larger plates will have more, small having maybe 2 servings of something and larger will have pretty much double (2 vs 4 dumplings as an example).

I left the ordering to my friend who selected a wide variety of plates from dumplings, rice rolls, spring rolls, bacon wrapped shrimp, mango custard, beef tripe, chicken feet and so on.  The radish cake seemed a bit underdone.  My friend said he preferred it crispier.  The amount of plates that we ordered even though it's for 6 it was a lot and we were all full in the end.  We had over a dozen plates and between us all after the tax and tip it turned out to be 13 bucks each.  That's like a buck a plate per person which wasn't bad.

Considering how much you get for the cost the value is really good.  It makes sense if you want the variety to come as a group and to yes, put your order in the morning while some items are still on morning prices.

For the morning service they take cash only.  I think they take cards later in the day however."}
{"text":"Food here can be a hit or miss depending on what you order - the fried squid tentacles were crispy and flavourful and cheung fun was soft and delicious. Shrimp siu mai is pretty good too but the har gow fell flat with a mushy overcooked skin so I'd pass on that. I was really excited about their dessert selection as they offered a variety that aren't always available at other dimsum places. If you are a fan of durian their flaky pastry definitely delivers! Molten lava buns and lotus paste sago pudding is best passed over, both were dry and overcooked. As other yelpers have pointed out, the service here is pretty subpar for dimsum standards. 

Overall if you have a specific dimsum craving to cover it's not a bad place to go, especially as it's not one of the busier spots with decent parking space, but there are other places in the neighbourhood that have a better overall quality to the food."}
{"text":"I'm giving an extra star because their dim sum is good but once again they messed up my bill. They forgot my egg tarts so when we asked for them, they added them to the bill even though they were already checked off. Then when I asked to have it corrected and the total came down  to 37.40 from $41 I also noticed they charged my 9 yr old for tea which they ALWAYS do, yet they give the white people a brutal tea service ie no 2nd pot for water, I always have to ask for them to add it to my pot.
I left $40 and was waiting for them to run after me complaining I left less than 10%, but it's their problem.. The servers would have had a better tip if the cashier didn't nickel and dime me every time I go here.
I won't be back until football season. We'll get our asses up and go to Dragon Boat where I've never had a problem with the bill and the dim sum is superior."}
{"text":"This is known as a Dim Sum place and not much else.  Dinner hours this place is very quiet unlike their Dim Sum hours.  It is in a small quiet plaza on Woodbine in the middle of 16th & Hwy 7 which makes them convenient for some local residents and factory/office workers nearby.

This place does Dim Sum better than the norm and as well they should because that is what this business is about.  That's probably the reason they charge a bit above the normal, but you get good QUALITY in a nice comfortable Teahouse environment.

It's not the biggest place on the block, so if you go during peak times you should expect a little bit of wait time at the door.  The few times I've been there with one other friend, I've never waited but only saw others wait instead.

To me, this is NOT one of the places where you can sit back and enjoy your TEA while reading the daily newspaper.  I'm OLD SCHOOL that way just like how I sit back and enjoy my Lattes, same philosophy. 

The general setting and the atmosphere kind of dictate the mood and pace, which makes it a EAT & GO Dim Sum place instead.  In terms of food, it does take time as you select your items from the order sheet which again takes away from the classical trolley method but nonetheless it comes out fresh and HOT.

I do feel safe when I eat here as it gives me the UPSCALE vibe, but then I'm from Scarboro where $2.00 Dim Sum is KING.  The flavours isn't that unique from any other place but it's definitely not as bad as some others.  Definitely worth a TRY if you drive."}
{"text":"Good dim sum. I went here for lunch and ordered the cellophane noodles, bok choy, pan fried dumplings, black bean spare ribs, and steamed bbq pork buns. Everything was good, with the pork buns being a stand-out favourite.

The food took a while to arrive, but came out in stages, and everything was hot and seemed freshly made.

They also have cool little devices you can use to call the servers, get your bill, etc. My opinion definitely improved on my second visit. It's good dim sum at a reasonable price -- and a good option if you're already in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We used to go here before they changed hands years ago.  We decided to try it again to see how it was.  The food was subpar to say the least.  The shumai was terrible with very fatty meat that was mushy.  Not good.  The BBQ pork puff pastries that we used to love getting were equally terrible.  They had a special \"tempura\" like eggplant that was delicious because it had cayenne peppers sprinkled on them... Just not the same.  I don't think we will be going here again anytime soon unless they bring up the quality of the food to what we remembered."}
{"text":"Royal Teahouse is my #2 dim sum place whenever I don't want to wait for seating at Dragon Boat. 

I rate it as a 3.5 but rounding up to a 4 since I'm never disappointed and service is quite good. 

I can't quite put my finger on it but the dim sum is not as fresh as Dragon Boat however it is above par compared to other dim sum establishments. 

Parking is never a problem as well. It has 2 dim sum items that most other places do not have, one is the steamed turnip cake and two is the deep fried vegetable roll."}
{"text":"This review is for their dim sum. I came here for dim sum Sunday morning for their early bird. Early bird is monday to sunday before 11:00 am for $2.90 for s/m/l. Tea price is $1.20/person. Its hard to find dim sum places less than $3.00 now a days. This place serves pretty decent dim sum despite the price being so cheap. But I do have to say service can be a hit or miss, sometimes they can be quite forgetful, rushed, and inattentive. For example last time I went they were all so pissed off for some reason so they didnt pick up any of our finished dishes (our table got crowded), forgot to refill our tea repeatedly, and forgot to bring our soy sauce and hot chili oil after asking them numerous times. But today everyone was cheerful and nice and the service was super fast and efficient. Like I said, the service can be a hit or miss. Dim sum is pretty standard but there are some items that I think are pretty yummy. Their steamed spare ribs is so flavourful and the meat is quite lean. The beef and bbq pork cheung fun is really soft. I had the shrimp cheung fun last time and it was chewy so stick with beef or pork. Their chiu chow fun gor goes really well with the spicy chili oil so remember to ask them for it cuz they will forget. They also walk around with baked pinapple bbq pork bun and mexican bbq pork bun. Both are very nice and its $3.50. Their fried seasme ball with black seasme paste is also delicious. The seasme ball is so yummy and crispy and soft. Last but not least the mango mochi with vanilla ice cream is also delicious. But order this after you are done with your dim sum because they bring it whenever and dont care if that might be your first dish. So order it at the end so the ice cream doesnt melt."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum. Similar layout to the previous restaurant at this location, no line and was seated right away. Dim sum selections is less than before but everything we ordered tasted good. Service was alright, not spectacular but nothing to complain about. Food came out quick and was hot and fresh. I would definitely come here for dim sum again."}
{"text":"This place is an okay option for dim sum but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. It is a decent price for most items and seems relatively clean. The food itself is my biggest complaint as most of the dishes range from alright to below average. I find their dumplings especially lacking as the shell/skin tastes oily and not quite right. Most of the rice and meat dishes taste decent though so you are still able to have a decent meal. I will probably end up here again but I won't be overly excited."}
{"text":"If you are planning to come here to celebrate something good, I'd like to kindly advise you to KILL THAT PLAN IMMEDIATELY OKAY. IT IS NOT WORTH IT OKAY. DONT BE A DILLY WILLY LIKE ME TO AGREE TO COME TO AN ANTROCIOUS PLACE LIKE THIS. You will ALL be doing yourself a HUGE favour fr fr. 

First off, service was just disgusting. Like other yelpers have mentioned, they were clearly understaffed and therefore, it was one hell of a mission to get the servers' attention. Also, it took forever for food to come out. I get that it's busy, but there's no way I should be waiting over like 30 minutes for my food... Not to mention, how the fling flang barnacles can the table next to me get their food first when they ordered AFTER us? Way to go \"Royal House\". It seems like this restaurant has a reputation for screwing up orders. We got an item in which we didnt even put down like ok. Oh and I kid you not. Apparently the table next to us didn't order the Peking Duck Wraps, but they somehow ended up with the remains of the duck. We ordered the wraps but we didn't even get our other duck parts yet like ?!? I don't understand those customers too like if you didn't order something, DONT EAT IT?! But regardless, they frking ATE A FEW PIECES until a server came over and took it away. Now idk if he noticed or the customers finally spoke up, but either way the server took it back to the kitchen. Another server came to our table a few minutes later with what seemed like the exact same plate of DUCK THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM OUR NEIGHBOUR TABLE. We literally explained to them and they seriously had the audacity to deny? Like there are clearly MISSING PARTS. THE PLATE DOESNT LOOK AT ALL FILLED UP LIKE OTHER TABLES WHO HAVE ORDERED THE SAME THING PLUS IT MAKES NO SENSE THAT IT COMES OUT LIKE OVER 30 MINS AFTER OUR PEKING DUCK WRAPS. LIKE ?!? WE WERE INFURIATED. CALL ME A PUNK BUT THIS IS FISHY AF. Other food were just straight up terrible. Don't even bother with the shark's fin soup because they charge $60 for a couple of measly strands of shark's fin (or whatever it is called). So little for what you pay for honestly (same with the other food). The peking duck was a literal disgrace too. Oily as hell (I can literally start an oil company from it like ffs) and it was bland as hell. Not worth. 

Sorry about the ramble, but I HAD TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST. EITHER WAY, I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. YOU ARE ONLY DOING YOURSELF A FAVOUR. DONT BE LIKE ME. WE LITERALLY SPENT OVER $125 AND WE ENDED UP GOING TO T&T TO GRUB BECAUSE STILL HONGRY. AND GUESS WHAT THE GOD DAMN $2 SANDWICH I HAD THERE WAS 8000 TIMES MORE TASTY THAN THE FOOD I HAD HERE. TOTAL FAIL ROYAL HOUSE .

Before Royal House, I was like this: \ (^v^) /
After Royal House, I was like this: :'( 

The change is drastic. Beware."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum at 5.30pm. I heard they have all day dim sum but only limited on their menu. The server don't speak English well unfortunately .Usually I go for dim sum before 11am but I was craving for dim sum. I ordered about 9 items on the menu. It was not busy yet so our service was quick. My fav dish is the shrimp spring roll , siu Mai and flaky durian pastry dessert. Our bill came up to $41 before tax (table for 2) which is kinda pricey but it's after hours so I can't complain. I like that they have a service panel where u can push 5 buttons to call out server. The washroom was very clean . After we paid our bill, they forgot our take-out dessert, which I think it's like a scam."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Many other selections in the area. Simply avoid this one. Service is poor and slow. Food come in phases and long wait between. Lower than average food quality compare to ones in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted to come here for dim sum because $2.80 for S/M/L dim sum if you place your order before 11:30am is too good a deal to miss out on. However, upon arrival I realized that some of the menu photos from Yelp are a bit dated. 

The new cost is $3.10 as of April 2018 for S/M/L dim sum if you place your order before 11:30am Monday to Friday and before 11am on Saturday and Sunday. 

I got here after 11:30am so I missed the dim sum deal. Regardless, the cost of the dim sum at regular price is still reasonable compared to other dim sum locations. Also, I thought this place would be crowded with people waiting for a table but only half the restaurant was full. 

We ordered four dim sum items, which I felt was plenty for two people. The wait was a bit longer than expected but at least I know it's made to order. I enjoyed the mushroom rice roll, it tasted very fresh with a good amount of filling. Also, the congee with fish fillet was delicious; normally, I don't like to have fish in my congee because of the fishy taste but this congee was very well-made and the fish tasted fine. I didn't realize until the Buddha delight arrives that it is deep fried (I was expecting it to be steamed, maybe I should have looked more carefully in the menu); nonetheless, the vegetarian filling was very well seasoned and I quite liked it. The bbq pork bun is like any other pork bun. 

Service-wise, I would say it's about the same as any other dim sum location. You have to call the waiter/waitress if you need anything like an extra pair of chopsticks, more soy sauce, or more tea. I won't complain as the waiter/waitress gets me what I need in a timely manner. 

Overall, I'll definitely be back as I want to get their $3.10 early morning dim sum deal in the morning."}
{"text":"I really like eating dim sum here because it's served very hot, the taste is quite good and they got some stuff that you can tell is something that is made to order cause you can't make it ahead of time.

This time the siu mai (steamed shrimp/pork dumpling) was delicious. it was steaming hot and juicy. The deep fried tentacles were also made nice as they use a dry rub to fry; I just couldn't stop eating them.
I tried this vegetable spring roll rice roll as I was hoping to find more items with veggies instead of deep fried or shrimp. The chinese translation led me to think perhaps it's not really a spring roll inside the rice roll. But nope, english translation was right, there is a deep fried spring roll in this rice roll. It tasted nice, they don't even have a vegetable spring roll on the menu. The spring roll was crispy and the rice roll was soft and hot. But not what I was hoping for, which was just vegetables.

One thing I did not like that was on the special menu, the fried Fishies (I have no idea what the english name is). The fishes were small and batter was thick; I did not like.

I'd say this place isn't too expensive ($60 for four people with 11 items) but it's not cheap either. Most times you won't have to wait long and that's the reason I come. The food also comes out at a reasonable rate, while food is still on the table. You want to eat dim sum with multiple things on the table and not one thing at a time."}
{"text":"This place has changed it's Chinese name a few times I believe but haven't changed their English name per say so I don't really know if the owners has change or whatever the case is.

Came here with some elderly people who loves drink tea as a normal ritual..the pricing here is a bit above average..not your regular $2.50 dim sum place...

The quality is just A-OK and service is not so great...they don't have enough staff and I need to put my hand up for a while before I am being attended to...

There was 4 of us and 1 toddler, I didn't feel like we ended up ordering that much stuff and our bill for DIM SUM was $70 so I found it a bit on the pricey side...I would much prefer to go to Casa Victoria for that price or perhaps even for a few dollars more..

The vermicelli has a lot of toppings, it was almost filled with toppings and no vermicelli...which is ironic because it was suppose to be vermicelli...

All in all, a place I'm not rushing to come back..."}
{"text":"I love dim sum.  I especially love it when it's half price in the mornings (before 11am).  This place isn't much in terms of décor but it packs a punch with it's cheap dim sum.

Located at the end of a strip plaza, it looks small from the outside but it can hold quite a few people.  By 10:45am it was pretty much full.  As it goes with dim sum we ordered quite a few dishes - all were good except one weird dish that looked like it was shrimp with candy corn (that Halloween candy) covering it (it was corn and carrots).  Interesting to try but won't be doing that again. 

We had so many dishes coming that I was shocked with the total - 6 people - it came to $13 with tax/tip!!   And we were fulllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll 

Now that's what I call a dim sum good deal!"}
{"text":"In hindsight, the first sign of trouble that should have clued me in was the condition of the fishes in the water tank.  They were all infected by Fin Rot and sickly, these are fishes intended for consumption by the customers.  :/

The waitresses service levels were what you expect from most Asian restaurants, not happy, just doing their jobs.

The food is decent, but the portions leave somewhat to be desired considering the price.

Hygiene is a big problem in this restaurant.  We found pubic hair in the pork meat and the female manager tried to pass it off as animal hair.  Mistakes happen, but owning up to it goes a long way.  No apologies were given by the manager, just \"Do you want this removed from your bill?\"  No genuine concern at all, just thinly contained annoyance.  She didn't even try to make eye contact.

The cashier even had the galls to demand a 10% tip after we gave a token $1 tip.  We decided to leave the moment we found the pubic hair and saw how the female manager handled things.  Tips are not mandatory, it is earned, and generally it does even for unhappy Asian waitresses but not this time.  

I do have to say kudos to the owner though.  He cares about his restaurant's image and apologized when he found out about the matter.  It is what kept this review from sinking into 1 star.

Who you hire and how they handle situations like this is paramount to restaurant success.  However I am gravely concerned about their hygiene and cleanliness of their food.


--- Edit:  Oh my god.  Another reviewer, Kelly J, also ran into hair follicles in her food too.  Who is this joker they hired as a chef for this restaurant?!"}
{"text":"Been here for dimsum as well as dinner. Everything is good quality and clean! What more can you ask for when dinner comes with dessert? Always a deal. Their dinner menu is slightly fancier than your regular family style chinese dinner - they change it up a bit so they are unique."}
{"text":"Was brought here because I was told this was one of the best dim sum places in Toronto... hmmmm I was expecting a lot because I was brought here by a person for Hong Kong. But I've had better in NY... Not to say there isn't good food in Toronto. There are tons. But this place was a bit of a disappointment. Hopefully it's not the \"best dim sum\" Toronto has to offer because I was definitely disappointed... Ordered a bunch and they let me pack up and take back to my hotel room. Eh!"}
{"text":"If I ordered the Minced Pork Dumplings with Chili Sauce the first time, I might not come here for dim sum the second time.  They were not the chili dumplings I expected when they came.  However, I told myself I should try first and see.  Oh gosh, there were too much meat and worst of all fat meat!  My mom tried one and it was full of fat meat too.  We did not finish the rest because these dumplings were just not to our liking.  

I ordered the chiu chow dumplings and crispy tofu steamed rice noodles again and they were still good.

The service was ok but I never expect too much service in a Chinese restaurant lol."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum restaurants I have been to.  I have searched high and low and eaten at most of the restaurants in Markham and Richmond hill and have decided there is no need to search further- this is the GO TO dim sum place.  Lots of choice.  Fresh and inventive.  Their \"small special dishes\" are great too. Compared to restaurants even in Vancouver, Richmond BC this is still my favourite.  Best baked bbq pork buns! Best egg tarts!  Best sesame ball."}
{"text":"My mom and grandpa who were frequent customers of this establishment insist that I write a review about the horrible service they received the last time they were here. Therefore this review is strictly customer service-based. Although one can argue that customer service affects your enjoyment of food as well.

A couple weeks ago, my mother and grandpa came to this restaurant for lunch. The restaurant was not busy and there were plenty of empty tables. The hostess proceeds to place my mother and grandpa at the 2 person table close to the door. Now, my grandpa is 94 years of age and he prefers not to sit near the door (its winter and cold and he is old so you can't blame him), in fact he asked if he could sit at one of the four person tables so that he could be more comfortable and farther from the door, to which the hostess replies \"NO, we have a policy where if you only have a party of 2 you can't sit at a bigger table.\" Now, normally my grandpa and mom would totally understand as it is a reasonable policy BUT, don't go telling my family you have a firm policy when you already have parties of 2 sitting in tables for 4 people. My grandpa and mom are not blind and they certainly do not appreciate your double standard. Do not contradict your own policies and declare that your rules are strict. Furthermore, there were many empty tables and no customers even waiting. Now I know this is not the hostess' fault as my mom has mentioned, the hostess received strict orders from her manager. So people I urge you to think twice about going to places like this where managers don't know how to keep with up customer service. In the end, my mom and grandpa left because why would anyone want to eat at a place where they are treated like this anyway. Needless to say my grandpa and mom would not be returning to a horrible place such as Royal Teahouse."}
{"text":"\"Food was not bad but no service whatsoever\"

We went to Royal Teahouse before 11am on a Saturday. It was the third time we came here for dim sum.

When we arrived, no one greeted us. The waiters they all saw us but no one cared to even ask how many people. Finally we were seated. We made sure we have our order in before 11am to take advantage of the $2.8@S, M, L early bird price. While we're waiting for our food to come, we realized they didn't even ask us what tea we wanted! After around 20 mins of waiting, the first dish finally came. Dim sum was great, hot and fresh. 
However the whole time we were there we have seen tables to our right and to our left got their orders messed up. 
The table to my left had THREE of their dishes messed up! 
1. they were waiting for a deep fried dim sum but got a steamed one. the waiter asked if they want the wrong one and they ended up taking it because they have been waiting for too long!
2. they ordered two dishes and they came to my table and the table to my right respectively. 

so...if you can put up with the non existent services and enjoy good dim sum for a reasonable price, then you can consider this place."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre.  We were given a room as we had more people, which was nice.  But there were so many flies in the room!! It made the dinner unbearable.  Service was below average, usually places I go to for Cantonese food with 10+ people they will help u split & distribute the food, which didn't happen here.  Our table also ordered sweet & sour pork on top of our combo, but they forgot about it.  The food was average but the upgrade we did on the fish from steamed to fried was disappointing, it looked nice but taste was mmm below average.  Other food is just average.  Nothing to rave about.  The plates and cups were definitely below average on cleanliness."}
{"text":"I am only writing this review because I'm bored from waiting more than half an hour for steamed fish. Food's ok though."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review because this place is small and the lineup isn't that bad for an early dimsum. (I don't want that line to get too long!) This is the deal of the century. Order before 11:00am and the price is cheap! We had 17 dishes, of various sizes and the bill came to $60! The food is great and the place isn't too noisy like other restaurants. So if you're in Markham or Richmond hill and a bit of an early bird, head on over to this place. But if I'm in line, you better eat fast ;)"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie the food is decent which would give it three stars. HOWEVER, in the steamed chicken there were bones in it and the fun guo dumplings i found plastic in it. LASTLY THEY \"FORGOT\" to give my $40 when giving my change back. 

You're better off going somewhere else in markham."}
{"text":"(No star if the App allows me to choose) Horrible Service! Actually there's no service at all. 


All employees are unhappy working here, they don't care about customers. And you can actually hear the staff arguing with each other as well, pushing off duties...
When you ask for condiments or change of cutlery, no one will come back with what you asked for. Even the bill took 15 mins to arrive! I almost walked out of there without paying! 

Food is decent but takes awhile for it to come. I'm sure there are other better dim sum restaurant near the area.

I'll definitely NOT come back here again!"}
{"text":"Overall for lunch dim sum during weekday: 4 stars

This is a specific rating, because I have only been to Royal Teahouse on Friday lunch hours.  I have been here many time with co-workers (1 of them has a 10% off card).  They have *superb* services: 1) on one Chinese new year day, our party of 10 opted to have dim sum here.  We called to place order of dim sum ** OVER THE PHONE ** prior to arrival, so that we could return work within 1.5hour; 2) tea and water are refilled promptly; 3) empty dim sum dishes are quickly removed.

Royal used to only serve dim sum and stir fry noodle/rice at regular price during lunch hour, like after 12pm.  It was not too busy then.  Lately, they have started to offer special lunch priced stir fry rice and noodle, soup noodles, etc..  Therefore, it has more traffic now.  

I generally find the dim sum here delicious.  The quality has been consistent over the last 3 years.  We tried one of the new special lunch time stir fry rice, and it was quite okay.  Tasty is the word for the food here.

The venue is clean and the decor is classy contemporary.  

I know I will return for dim sum."}
{"text":"Ordered ten items plus a yang chow fried rice.  Nothing special. Service was on the slower side.  The yang chow fried rice did not have any pork in it and just two pieces of shrimp. The only items that were better than the others was the beef balls  and BBQ in puffed pastry."}
{"text":"3 star for food, 2 star for service, 1 star for business practices.

My other half and I have not been to dim sum for a while and actually woke up early on a nice spring Saturday and thought to ourselves, today feels like a dim sum day. We Yelped and found Royal house.

Upon entering the restaurant was bustling but not insanely busy. We were seated within 5 minutes or so. There is a daily special before 11 on weekends of $3.10.

The menu was a basic dim sum menu that didn't include anything out of the ordinary or Instagram worthy.

Food came out timely and hot. Quite decent, but nothing outstanding. 

We had asked at the beginning to get WATER NO TEA, as we just didn't feel like tea and were given a pot of hot water.

When we asked for the bill we were still charged a \"tea charge\". When we told them we didn't have tea, just water they explained that \"well there's the cleaning of the table clothes and other over head\". Mmmkk....so you want us to pay for your cost of doing business? 

Really it's just a $1.20 or so per person, it's a minor thing but when you say TEA CHARGE on the bill and we didn't get tea, that's still not something we ordered and are being charged for.

Fine fair enough, we didn't argue further and just paid. 

We paid $50 on a bill of $44 expecting change.

15 minutes went by and I had to go to the empty cashier desk and inquire where my change was because I never got it.

This is another thing that annoys me about restaurant's.  I really dislike \"miscellaneous\" surcharges. While if you gave me amazing service, I would have no problem leaving $6 or' more of a tip on a bill of $44 (13% or more), but when you don't give me my change at all and seemingly assume that I don't want change AND you charge me for something that I never had, then any reasonable person may get a tad annoyed. 

And I think I'm just as reasonable as the next person, so here's my review :)"}
{"text":"Review only refers to the dim sum here...not the dinner.  This joint is my new fav with the best taro selection in Toronto.  I find that a lot of other dim sum restaurants use some sort of modified starch...but this cat is all about the real thing.

I come here usually once per week at a minimum...they must put some sort of drug in their dishes because I crave it pretty bad by Tuesday or Wednesday.  If I'm lucky enough to make it out during the weekdays...line up isn't too bad...but warning...there usually is a line up....especially on Saturday or Sunday.

The boss lady and most of the workers seem pretty nice...but I guess if you come here as much as I do...they would be nice to you too.  It's loud, proud and all around good food here. 

Parking is pretty ample and place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and each time it was pretty good.
The food is great, consistent, and of a high standards. The dim sum is comparable to high class places back in Hong Kong (where I'm from) or China.
However service is dependant on when you come in. Lunch is swamped with people so service would be slower like any other place. 
My best personal favourite is their steamed rice noodle roll. It has the right consistency, not too thick and sticky, but not too thin that it breaks when you touch it. Another love of mine is their stream egg paste bun. The egg paste is just right where is melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Generally love this place as it is quiet and good is generally great.  But pricey tho.  The only time was disappointed around xmas time,  even some dimsum looked different, with too much herbs.  Could have been from seasonal cooking staff."}
{"text":"Tried this dimsum place and was not disappointed. Unlike other places, there is no huge lineup . We waited for 10 minutes for a party of 7. They offer dimsum and hot dishes, price is just right. Every dish that came out, from siomai to rice rolls are all really good. The best thing that I enjoyed was the egg covered bitter melon.

They offer pecking duck and other interesting items for dinner which I bookmarked on my next visit.

Place is clean, service is ok. The downside on the dimsum experience is that they charge tea service per person even if kids did not have any. Told the server but I guess they did not understand what was asked, does not understand english very well."}
{"text":"We came here as table of 13 on a Sunday night. We were given a room at the back which was nice.

My initial reaction was that the plates and bowls were very dirty. There were food remnants on almost everything and several wine glasses had lipstick on it.

Our first few dishes came back to back and were decent. We changed our fish dish to deep fried fish and filets.
It arrived overcooked and cold.. Quite a disappointment.

The break between our main courses and the rice/noodles was a 50minute wait and we had to remind them we were still waiting on it. Our server was not even aware we had both rice and noodles.. We had to pull out the menu and show her.

Another main issue aside from the cleanliness is that there were many, many fruit flies/tiny mosquitoes that were hovering our table the entire night. I could point out at least 5 at one time.. Literally gave me goosebumps.

We also added two order of sweet and sour pork on top of our set menu meal at the beginning but this never came.. Their loss. 

Overall our server for the night was quite attentive but sad to say I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"It's pretty good.  Busy place in the mornings when they have the dim sum specials... come early.  It's slightly above average."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. Atrocious attitude.

Came here on a Friday morning to see if I could add this to my list of Markham Dim Sum Joints. 

The decor was nice. That's about it.

Our order was placed at 11:20 AM to take advantage of their discount before 11:30 AM. We waited till 11:50 AM (30 minute wait) and asked one of the serversif we could speak to the Manager to ask when the food was coming. Not only did the waiter not bring the Manager, he also gave us attitude and lip. I stood up and left.

Do not come here if you're hungry."}
{"text":"So apparently this place has been taken over by a new owner. The food sucks, the service sucks, and the prices have increased and the portions are so small. I would go into details about each item we ordered but i would have so much to say. Just listen to the other reviews below. For a table of 6 people, the bill came up to about $100 and we had to get food somewhere else too. There are tons of dim sum places on markham. Do yourself a favour, Go to any other one except this one."}
{"text":"Haven't done this in a while, sop forgive me if this doesn't read as well as I had planned.

I stumbled across this place when I was hunting for a new place to eat around work the other day. I was thrown by the teahouse part of the name but found out that its a pretty decent dim um restaurant as well. I ordered some takeout and it was great. I've had better dim sum elsewhere but I haven't been to a place as clean or as efficient as this place. Most dim sum places work on a cash only basis and it's hard to pay by debit or credit. It was no issue here and price was great too (12.95 for 4 items off the dim sum menu)

Their in house menu is more extensive but their take out menu was well stocked that that is an option as well.

Lovely place, definitely going there again. DO IT!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum yesterday afternoon with my family; we have been coming here for years.  Royal Teahouse is on our short list of dim sum restaurants in Markham.   The décor is nice, and the restaurant is bright and clean.  Although it is not the best dim sum in Markham, the food is always fresh, and we tend to go here particularly if we don't want to wait (too long) to be seated although it is usually busy.  Often, if we go for dim sum late (like yesterday) at 1 pm we don't have to wait to be seated here.   The restaurant is a good size with many tables, banquette seating along the walls, and a room that can be used for private seating.

The usual dim sum items are offered and I always order the typical dishes like shrimp dumplings (har gow) and siu mai, but relative to other dim sum spots, I think their sticky rice in lotus leaf and chicken feet are particularly good here.   I always enjoy the dim sum here and service has always been friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Dim sum before 11:30am is $3.10 for all sizes. The reason I am giving this place a 3 star rating is because I went to the washroom before leaving and saw one of their employees NOT WASH THEIR HANDS, after using the toilet. 

To be honest I'm not even sure if that employee touched any of my food but it's disgusting! I didn't get sick after my visit but I will NOT be returning. I'm pretty sure this is some restaurant violation."}
{"text":"fair dimsum place. 
could get busy during lunch hour so try to be early to get sit and happy hour bonus"}
{"text":"I would say Royal Teahouse is on the higher end of the Chinese dim sum scene and of course naturally comes with higher prices. 

I firmly believe restaurants with excellence service, clean environment and superior  food quality can commend higher prices but failing one of those factors will render itself not worthy of charging premium prices. Although Royal Tea house was quite clean, the service was decent, the taste of the food was a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the ingredients were quite fresh but it lacked flavour in almost all the dishes we ordered!  Everything was bland even the soy sauce that came with the \"Chung fun\"!  I was literally soaking my Chung fun in the soy sauce.  It could just be they use less sodium or msg which is healthier but I prefer my dim sum flavourful. 

If you can wake early, go early. Anything order before 11am get a flat rate."}
{"text":"WAIT, the Food is fantastic! I liked the dim sum that they offer.  What was memorable to me were : Fried tentacles fried just right and flavour spot on. Our favourite was the Bitter Melon coated in salted egg, fried Taro & the noodle rolls. 

What we didn't like is these guys can be a cheat when it comes to the bill. So be careful and review yours properly.  We were a table of 7 with 4 tea drinking adults only to be charged a full 7. When asks the server simply shrugs it off. Not cool."}
{"text":"Advertised as changed and under new name.  Slightly changed decor. Sat down quickly, found the bowls were not cleaned well. I had to do my own cleaning. Food choice wasn't that great but managed to pick few traditional items. Food  taste is 2.5/5, speed 2/5, quality 2.5/5, service 3.5/5, price 3/5. They seem to have some come back customers which I don't quite understand. Overall I think it is slightly worse than when it was under previous name. I will not come back again"}
{"text":"Since it has changed owners, we have been here a few times for dim sum.  My first dim sum visit about a few months ago was very good but I waited until now to review it so that I can see if the quality is consistent given that there were some poor reviews.

If you place your order before 11am, the S,M,L dishes are all at $3.10 on the weekend.  The Siu Mai, Beef balls were tasty and huge. The Shrimp Cheung Fun was delicious filled with large shrimps and dau miu (snow pea shoots) vegetable.  We also got the beef stomach with white radish stew which may not sound too appealing but it's done really well here and I highly recommend it.  We also got the steam spareribs stone pot rice which is a nice dish to finish off. We had altogether 5 dishes and total bill came to about $25 including tax as we had made it yesterday before 11am which is a really good deal.  The service was okay but I would definitely come back for the food."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Woodbine Ave and Highway 7 at the plaza with Master Q Snooker, Billiards, and Lounge. Parking lot was quite full on Saturday morning, and it was a bit of a walk to the front entrance. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Staff were friendly and we had no issues with the service. However, servers weren't personable and did not really check on how we're doing. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Tables and chairs were clean and I liked the gold table cloths and warm colour scheme of the decor. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
Pretty good quality for the price. One of the least expensive spots for weekend early bird dim sum on in Markham. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Weekend Early Bird Special before 11AM - $3.08 for S/M/L Dim Sum: dim sum was slightly above average. Dim sum was slightly above average. The most interesting item was the Seafood Dumpling with Conpoy in Soup because it was one giant dumpling in a soup and tasted slightly like Chinese herbs. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
Definitely a great spot for early bird dim sum because you can order quite a large variety of S/M/L dim sum from the menu without worrying too much about the price."}
{"text":"Played hooky from work so I could indulge in some week day dim sum.  We arrived around 10am (super early bird) and there was lots of seating.

We checked off the usual dim sum suspects from the menu and were impressed that the dishes came out piping hot.  I might have scarred myself when my deep fried sesame ball gushed its innards onto my thumb.

Early bird pricing before 11am of $2.40 per dish but they do not take credit or debit during this time."}
{"text":"A very good 4.3 for the quality and variety. Prices are really ok too. I'd like to go back right now but it is far from downtown."}
{"text":"Went in the morning before 1130am for the early birds deal. I believe that it is quite good to have the deal ending at 1130am, compare to the usual 11am that most dim sum restaurants offer. 

To be honest, the food is just meh... Taste like regular dim sum, nothing special. But the rice noodle rolls are really smooth."}
{"text":"Yes I am coming to Royal Teahouse for dinner instead of dim sum.

They do have set menu where you can pick 2/3/4/5 courses from a specific menu and the more you order the cheaper the cost per dish. There are over 40 dishes you can select from so there must be something for everyone.

I found the dishes here are sizable so we were full even ordering the 2 dish set meals. 

The staffs here are one of the friendest one I meet in term of Chinese restaurants.

They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for Dim Sum! They have most of the popular dim sum dishes and the wait is usually not as bad as the more popular places - at least I never had to wait. But it can get quite crowded during afternoons.

One thing that loses points is how long the Dim sum came out.. we waited 20 minutes for our first dish and a total of 40 minutes to get our very last dish ( which was deep fried taro and beef balls). I like how they have all day dimsum but it's limited dishes. I would also recommend you coming here for their Peking duck which is also good."}

Food:
A good dim sum place. Not super nor terrible. A nice middle of the road. 3solid stars

{"text":"We drove from Mississauga all the way to Richmond Hill/Markham (border) for dim sum (and my dentist appointment). But stupid Dragon Boat Fusion was 100% FULL at 10:30AM on a Saturday, ARG!! Go figure!

So we quickly looked for an alternative because I disappointed my hungry stomach and boyfriend (my driver) since I promised dim sum.

Here is the right-next-door dim sum place (well, a block from here) with pretty good rating! 

Firstly, the service is mind-blowing amazing. Right away we were greeted (unlike Dragon Boat, with 100 customers at the door but ONE wait staff!? Seriously). Dim sum comes in a span of 10 minutes, SUPER hot!!!

The pork siu mai falls apart very fast. The xiaolongbao (Shanghai dumplings) were terrible (I KNEW this but I had such strong cravings for them!!!). Deep fried wontons were also quite terrible.

The other stuff were decent! Really liked the beef tripe and deep fried tentacles, shrimp dumplings were just okay, steamed beef balls were very tasty the next day (lol). 

The decor here is amazing and very clean! The sofa-seat tables are too close together, that our neighbour's bottom could push our food off the table when she exited. Otherwise, it's a place I'll take my lovely godmother to :) so we can chat and enjoy the no-rush and crowd-less atmosphere.

I love the staff here!! They were frantically preparing the tables for their 12 noon rush (Saturday, and Day 1 of March Break). So every time a group leaves, they immediately clear AND SET the tables. I saw the manager telling (politely) at the staff to clear the tables, and the staff hurried (and happily) did this in 1-2 minutes (it's SO fast!) I also saw a table setter shout (politely) at another staff, \"Door, door!\" and the lady ran towards the entrance yelling, \"Welcome, how many are you? What tea?\"

I saw another staff run towards a new table with utensils frantically asking, \"What tea?\" and the table answered \"We already ordered, thanks!\"

The staff here are so fast (AND they work together) but at the same time they're not rude at all (which is extremely rare for Chinese dim sum places!) I also liked that the floor managers seem very polite to the dim sum servers (floor managers are higher rank than servers), which made the servers less grumpy when serving. 

Every single staff will look around their proximity before walking away -making sure they don't miss a waving hand! And every single staff will take your orders/needs/whatever, no matter their rank. 

Definitely will return!"}
