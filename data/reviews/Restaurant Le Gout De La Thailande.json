{"text":"What a delightful BYOW. Food is better than most fancy Thai restos on Laurier or in town. We had such a blast. We loved it. Staff very caring. Good portions. True, not a fancy place but food very good. Yes, we r back next week for sure."}
{"text":"Very decent and cheap. Not a \"great\" restaurant but hard to beat quality-price ratio."}
{"text":"Its not a big dining room, like maybie 40 peoples max. Deco is okay, no big deal there, but the food is absolutly not Thai!! The pad thai is terrible. The sauce they use is really different from alot of Thai joints. Missing the peanuts and also no lime is offerred. The noodled was a bit overcook.

Ive been to Au Thailand and Pamika, and by far, the taste is different and way tastier.

I took the fried squid with a spicy sauce. The squid was really thin and there was not much. The sauce was good but it does not feel like a Thai experience considering the name of the restaurant.. this restaurant is maybie an asian fusion or more a chinese type copying some thai dish. 

My friend took a general tao and a grilled chicken (its a brochette). It was a okay for them, not the best. They told me the soup is really good tho. 

Would i go back? No."}
