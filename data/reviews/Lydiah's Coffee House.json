{"text":"Good food, good price, good service! What more can you ask for. The food was excellent! It was \"home cooking\", great quality and taste. I also like to support locally owned small businesses."}
{"text":"I had the Friday meal. It was tilapia, beans, something else, and rice. It was delicious. I haven't had any of the other meals, but I plan to soon. The beans and the other side were spicy, but not too spicy. It was $8.50 plus tax I believe."}
{"text":"Lydiah's Coffee House is the best place in Pittsburgh for a cup of coffee...Great atmosphere by owner Lydiah and the best Somoas's in Pittsburgh.   The Lunches are hearty and you never leave work or her shop  hungry!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best consistent cup of coffee in the area. Beats out Starbucks line and crazy mochas taste."}
{"text":"I love this place. The daily lunch is delicious. And it's definitely a good choice if you want something different. Lydia is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Very friendly.  I have stopped in once for a cup of coffee.  The smell inside was amazing.  They cook one lunch a day and on this day it was stew, and if it weren't 95 degrees out on this particular day I would have had a bowl.

They also have pastries that I have never heard of before.  I asked about the one and it is some type of doughnut, they gave me a free sample and now I'm scared that I'm going to get fat because it was so delicious and I have to walk by this place two or three mornings a week."}
{"text":"It took some research on Yelp and deep thought before I decided to pull the trigger and try this little place. I enjoy curry but am not necessarily in love with it, but I have been on a spice kick lately for some reason and decided to go.

Thursday is Curry Spaghetti and ribs day, so that is what I got along with green beans on the side. The spaghetti had a little bit of spice, but really not much. The ribs were very tender and flavorful. Kind of questioned what kind of meat they were after awhile. Pork? Beef? Goat? Either way, very good.

Place is small, basically a counter only for take out. 

Good lunch. Just enough spice with the curry to give me a few sniffles of a runny nose and keep my tongue tingling for a few minutes after finishing."}
{"text":"Despite having \"Coffee House\" in its name, I haven't tried the coffee here. Mainly because I don't drink much coffee. However, let me tell you about the food. It is my understanding that the owner is Kenyan and she serves Kenyan food for lunch. She serves a different food \"special\" each day of the week, which I wish I could say I've tried all the specials. Sadly, I've only tried the curry chicken and curry beef stew. They were both very comforting, flavorful, tender and delicious. She has a very nice touch with the spices where it's just right: not too spicy but not bland whatsoever. All the food dishes are made from scratch in-house each day. I also came to learn that she makes the ginger beer as well, not the canned or bottled stuff. The ginger beer is sweet, slightly spicy, but so refreshing alongside a comforting curry meal. 

I definitely plan on coming here to try all her offerings when the weather is warm, since the location is a bit on the outskirts of downtown and it's a bit of a walk for me. Another thing to note is that the food is mainly for take-out and there is not much seating here. She has one stool for the counter and that's it. Take-out or not, the food here is definitely worth a try if you're looking to try something new and different for lunch."}
{"text":"It's pretty much just takeout, but everything I've ever had here has been great.  The owner's are very friendly and I always enjoy trying the different things she has on the menu.  The Thursday special with Curry spaghetti and beef ribs is pretty incredible, but so its pretty much everything you can get there."}
{"text":"I was walking downtown looking for a place that hit the spot and I could smell the deliciousness coming from this corner shop. Friday lunch special. A sweet meet and greet and tummy satisfaction. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden jewel. If you love Caribbean style food this is the place for you. I took one star off because they close at 2pm. If they were open later it would give you the option to take some delicious food home for dinner. The curry chicken and the tilapia are my favorite dishes. Clean , fresh food, friendly and very affordable. Try it you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a lunch. Absolutely delicious food - my favorite the Friday special : fish curry with coconut beans, yummy!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite downtown carryout. I've tried the tuesday, wednesday, and thursday specials (all delicious) but the tuesday is my clear favorite so far. The food is a great value, doesn't feel too heavy, and is super-flavorful. And the owner is really awesome and sweet. I think I've told every single person in my office at least twice that they need to go here (so happy its just down the street)"}
{"text":"The coffee is not for the faint of heart. Strong without being too bitter. Very reasonably priced! I inquired about the delicious-looking triangular pastry in the case, and Lydiah described it as being similar to a funnel cake. (Found out later it's called mandazi.) I got one to go with my large coffee, and, oh! It did not disappoint! It's fried to perfection. Not greasy, not too sweet. Chewy, delightful companion to my coffee. One day I'll come back for the meal as well, as I'm sure it will be good."}
{"text":"Awesome little place, that I stumbled into by accident. Lydia is cooking a different meal every day if you fancy more than a coffee or a home made snack. She and her husband are really friendly and the espresso is great!"}
{"text":"Read a post gazette review and decided to try this little place for lunch.  I understand the owner is Kenyan and I'm by no means an expert, but I thought it was quite tasty.  Had the Tilapia came with rice and a side -- it was an insanely huge lunch for like $7.   I was just sad they were out of samosas when I got there.  

I really hope this place does well.  The lunch options around that part of downtown get boring FAST and this is a nice addition."}
{"text":"I love going to Lydiah's and getting to try something new.  I'm a vegetarian and she only has one special for the day, but there are always enough sides that it makes a meal and they're always tasty.  The chai is particularly good, too!"}
{"text":"Downtown employees have it so nice sometimes. Places like this have a very specific group of customers, as is evidenced by their limited hours. So I consider myself very lucky to have found this place during one of the few times I'm in the area during a weekday lunch time. It doesn't help that you really wouldn't suspect much about this place unless you got closer, since \"coffee house\" doesn't really say much about the unique food here! The place has no seating and is meant purely for takeout, but it is quite nice and efficient, while the owner is very friendly. 

The food is fantastic. Portions are a decent size, and a large for $9 is very worthwhile if you are hungry. In particular I had the Thursday special of spaghetti and ribs. I've never had curry with either of these items, but I was definitely a fan. The curry had a good flavor and kick, but it was still mild in a good way. It also helped that the spaghetti was made well on its own and the ribs were basically tender chunks of meat falling off the bone. I'm sure any of her other daily specials would be just as good.

To go with this, we also ordered the Kenyan chai tea, which was quite ginger-y and less strong than a typical chai. Very good!"}
{"text":"Lydiah's Coffee House is a prime example of what makes small business so great, particularly those in the food service industry! The owner (Lydiah) is incredibly kind and friendly, and the food she makes is very delicious. Every different menu item I've had thus far is of the curried variety, which is expertly done. Not too much, not too little, just the right amount of delicious curry flavor. The small lunch special is economical, but also jam packed with a great amount of food.

The Kenyan chai tea is also quite a treat which I will be enjoying the next time I stop in for lunch."}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown!  Every Monday, she has traditional Kenyan food- like curried goat and the mush-like side that accompanies.  the curry spaghetti is nothing special, but the ribs are amazing.  Lydiah is friendly and eager to answer questions. A little pricy but worth a try."}
{"text":"Just tried Lydiah's for the first time. Delicious healthy comfort food! I ordered a \"small\" plate of today's special - it was enough for at least 2 meals. Very nice atmosphere - simple and clean. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh. Lydiah's is serving up authentic Kenyan cuisine in downtown Pittsburgh. 

She has assigned dishes to each day and it comes small or large. Nice portion size and very tasty food nonetheless. Today is Thursday, which is the curry spaghetti, green beans, and rib. Random combination but absolutely delicious.

She serves an authentic dish on Monday's, Wednesday is chicken, and Fish in Friday. If your looking for something different than your normal go to for lunch I recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Love it here, smells so good. Amazing chai and wonderful authentic african food as well"}
{"text":"Went there several times, sometimes just by myself and other times with friends.  In all cases, we noticed a trend when selecting the \"Large\" option ($9).  The portion of the meat is meager and small, and the great majority of the platter is filled with starchy foods.

For example, on a day that it was ribs, there were two bones with hardly any meat.  The rest was rice and side dishes.

On another day in which it was chicken, for $9 all we got was a drumstick and a meager small piece from the bird's chest.  The rest was just fluff.

I would compare that with the Shish Kebob offered at nearby Madonna restaurant just two blocks away, which for exactly the same price, one gets two skewers of cooked marinated lamb and two side dishes.

With such a comparison, there is no longer a desire to return to Lydiah's place for a lunch meal.

I am seeing great photos of meals that others have posted here, and they look attractive and abundant, but for me, it simply wasn't the case, and I cannot support those claims."}
{"text":"To all my adventurous foodies out there, Lydiah's authentic Kenyan cuisine is a must-try. They offer a limited variety of dishes, yet there is always a vegan option on the menu - a little something for everyone! However, the house blend coffee is not as good as others I've had around the area. What really stuck out to me though was Lydiah's enthusiasm and appreciation for her customers. Support one of Pittsburgh's own local businesses and enjoy a delicious budget-friendly meal!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have had the opportunity to chat with Lydiah at various social and political events around the city. She's such an amazing person and chef! It saddens me that she will be closing her doors on March 16th. Through no fault of her; the owner of her building is selling so that Bank of America can set up ATMs. Also saddens me I didn't take the time to write a review sooner. 
The food is so beyond fantastic. The flavors pop with every bit and make my mouth salivate!
Thursday is typically my favorite, goto day because I love her curry spaghetti and green beans so very much. Obviously that is the Thursday special.
Going to visit as many times as possible before the 16th and here's to hoping she continues at a new location!"}
{"text":"I can't improve on anything that has already been said. Lydiah's is fantastic. Kenyan food is not usually in my wheelhouse, but I could eat those sweet and fleetingly spicy curries any day of the week."}
