{"text":"Agréable surprise à Laval! L'aiglefin grillé est excellent, servi avec riz et salade de chou il s'agit d'un repas assez copieux! Si vous passez par ce coin de Laval, Le Chalutier est une bonne option!"}
{"text":"Le fish'n ship est tout simplement sublime et les pommes de terre grecque succulente!!!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur restaurant dans la région de Montréal pour un généreux fish & chips et d'excellents desserts maisons! Il faut arriver avant 18:00 hrs sinon il y a file..."}
{"text":"mediocre food at a mediocre price. Seems to be popular with the elder crowd. Waitress was super friendly, felt bad she was getting such a rough time from a nearby table. Hopefully my tip covered it."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Fish N' Chips! I had an itch for it and Le Chalutier provided relief!  The establishment is deceivingly huge and can sit well over 150 patrons in several diving areas found within. The resto is well kept, clean with comfortable seating. I did note that the majority of the patrons are 60+ and it was 70% full during lunch.... on a Thursday! Take that for what its worth.  I went with their \"table d'hote\" which consisted of a soup of the day, 1 fish filet, a side-order of my choice and some coleslaw. A filtered coffee and choice of dessert rounded out the dining experience.  For $17 I got to enjoy :  - Broccoli cream soup : Very good but desperately needed salt though. I guess that's normal as the typical patron here doesn't want too much salt in their food. Not the best broccoli cream of soup I've had but a solid start!  - Fish filet : First of all, this single filet was HUGE! Could have easily been 2 or 3 pieces. The tartar sauce was perfect. Came here for my fish and it was delivered. So yummy!  - Greek Potatoes : I opted for the Greek potatoes (there were 5+ options) and sprinkled some lemon on it and it was sublime. Is this a Greek resto? Because these potatoes were out of this world good!  - Coleslaw : I really like coleslaw and they delivered. Good not great though.  - Filtered coffee and pudding chomeur : All desserts are prepared in-house (Awesome!) and the selection available number close to 10. I opted for the pudding chomeur and it was good however I felt it was a tad small and I would have preferred if it was heated with perhaps the option to upgrade it \"a la mode\" for some hot and cold action in my mouth.  All in all, the \"table d'hote\" was good and well worth another re-visit in a few weeks time.  The service was quick and I felt they understood that patrons did come here for lunch and to wrap it up within an hour of our visit. They don't rush you but they definitely can accommodate. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient.  I definitely recommend \"Le Chalutier\" and hope future visits will bump this 4 star review to a 5."}
{"text":"Every time I want each time the service is.good and they listen well any request. The staff the owner everyone is nice. Didnt take long to get table was a line up so maybe reserved before but because I was have .child they make us fast seat. The food is tasty and fresh some home made soup and deserts. Its enough big to.go in a group."}
{"text":"Every time i come to visit my parents i`m guaranteed to come here. If not i feel disappointed. I seem to always get the one piece fish & chips special. For $15 you get a choice of soup of the day (usually 3 kinds), Bread, your fish comes with choice of potato and coleslaw. And about 15 desert choices. Face it you can't go wrong with that. The portion is filling and everything is as tasty as it comes. The fish is lightly rolled in a light breadcrumby mixture. You wouldn't call it battered since it isn't and fried so light that i can't even say it's fried. So obviously it's not greasy.  Be prepared to see a lineup on any night but they process people so fast and have plenty of seating it would be rare that you have to wait more than 15 minutes.  Besides since it's Quebec the odds are that you'll end up in conversation with the others waiting with you.  Top notch service, quality food, can't wait for my next visit to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is more like an old diner than an actual modern day restaurant. The deserts are very generic and there is an infinite choice of them... no fine patisserie but comforting nonetheless. Same with the sides, generic but acceptable. Ambiance... there is none and I think that's what they're going for. Service is super friendly and quick. The place is old but clean. Oh and the clientele is on the older side, but I tried it in the afternoon so I don't know what it's like at night. The older crowd might explain the lack of reviews for such a busy place. Do prepare for lineups at peak hours. Ok... now for the heart of my review: the fried fish!!! It is delicious. I am absolutely not a fan of fish and chips, but this place is the exception. Their fish is light, crispy and perfect without being too greasy. So so fresh! This will definitely be my go-to for a good piece of fish. The tartar sauce is also solid.  Enjoy your adventure in this old Laval ghetto :)"}
