{"text":"What to say about GSB? 

Their food is really quite good. I imagine it's even better after a night out on the town. I happened to stop by for lunch one day. I work in the area and wanted to try something new. There are about a dozen bar stools and some counters you can sit at to dine in, but that's it.

My coworkers and I got an assortment of items, which were all bigger in portion size than we expected. The food is heavy-- the kind that makes you want to take a siesta-- but flavorful, made to order, and made with real ingredients. 

The flauta is huge, and filling (I recommend beef)! The chicken quesadilla is delicious and also rather large. All the meat is flavorful and it seems to be shredded on site. The homemade chips are awesome! Truly delicious, if unhealthy, food. 

One thing I've got to say that irks me though, is the decor. I know, I know, we're in a college town. The inside of this small restaurant is painted cardinal red and covered in UW memorabilia. Fine. The bathroom however... Yes, your name is \"Get Some Burritos\", but do you really have to put suggestive quotes and euphemisms all over your walls? Aren't \"that's what she said\" jokes a little passé at this point? Step up your game GSB. Class it up just a touch, and maybe someday I'll dine in instead of always getting food to go."}
{"text":"It's open late, which is great, but it's neither locally owned nor very high quality."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time on a Friday afternoon, after the lunch rush. Had 2 awesome tacos, one chicken, one beef. They take soft-shell tortillas and deep-fry them when you place your order, shape them and then jam the now hard shells with fresh ingredients. Super good!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Get Some Burritos once, and it struck me as just so-so. I came because they offered a deal for a discounted burrito and drink via an iPhone app. 

I ordered the carne asada burrito. I was happy to wait ~5 minutes for my food, because I could see that they were preparing my meal to-order, which is always a bonus. The burrito contained steak, guacamole, and pico de gallo, plus lettuce and jalapeños (which I added for an additional $0.50). I'm not very familiar with so-cal mexican food, so I'm not sure if that style typically includes rice and beans in the burrito, but they were sorely missed here. 

The steak was well-marinated, juicy, flavorful, and cooked through while still maintaining a good texture. That was the best part of the burrito. 

The pico de gallo was also a high point--fresh and tasty. 

The guac here was nothing to write home about, and to be honest, it tasted like it had been sitting out for a couple of days. I saw cilantro in it, but I could barely taste it. It needed seasoning and the consistency was much too mushy for my liking. 

One bite into my burrito and my plate was covered in juice dripping out of the bottom of the tortilla. The burrito was extremely filling, but the ratio of stuffing to tortilla was off, which left me with more than a handful of \"just tortilla\" bites, and these bites were completely dry (not surprising considering most of the juices were spilled onto my plate). 

I ordered to-go, and although I didn't eat IN the establishment, I had some time to get a feel for the environment while waiting for my food to be cooked. The staff was upbeat and friendly, and they were happy to answer questions I had about the menu. The decor is typical of a college town--UW memorabilia speckled across the walls--but if you're looking to dine-in, I'd definitely recommend going somewhere else. The only seating is a counter with maybe 10 bar stools. 

Overall, 3 stars for good components of the meal (steak, pico), discounts offered, freshness, and friendliness. They could've earned another star by filling up that burrito with some rice and beans, or by making the tortilla size smaller so that the ingredients actually fill it out. If I ever do come again, I'll probably try the carne asada fries--all of the decent parts of the burrito, minus the poor construction."}
{"text":"The meat is much better quality than los gemelos, and they introduced me to carne asada fries, enough said."}
{"text":"I moved here from So Cal 4 years ago. Since I've been here this is the closest I've had to one of my favorite places from back home. This is also the first place I've been to in Wisconsin that not only knows what a proper skirt steak is, but how to make it. 
Also what they make is an avocado sauce, not guacamole.  Also the best I've had in Wisconsin. 

The service was great, the people were extremely nice and the food came out timely. I also spoke with the owner for a bit which was nice. He explained how he actually flew to Cali to research before they place opened. It's awesome to hear the passion in his story. 
There is only one con though. The only reason I didn't give it five stars has to do with the portions. Back in So Cal if you spend as much on a burrito you get something twice as big. I'm sure if the portions get a slight face lift then they would have the poor college kids flocking. At 7 or 8 bucks, you should have a burrito big enough to take some home.

As soon as I get downtown again, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious little spot. Quick, cheap and definitely a Los Gemelos contender for best burrito on campus. It's pretty nondescript as people walk by but I recommend stopping in next time - the guy working was also playing some bomb music."}
{"text":"I've never really had buyer's remorse for something as simple & inexpensive as a burrito...until today.  Shelled out $9+ for their Badger burrito. The meat was cooked decently which is the only good thing about it (and the burrito was substantial.) the mix of beef, rice, guac & pico made for a weird flavor with some random sweet/smokey undertones that were horrible. This burrito had fries in it but they seemed almost raw, looking white. Cheese?  Hardly. The soupy mess made the tortilla break and by half way thru I couldn't stand the flavor anymore and I quit. First time I've ever quit on a burrito. For $9 I learned it's possible to hate a burrito, I have gooey brown liquid on my shirt & I donated at least a half pound of food to a landfill.

With all those bad tastes I'll never go back as one of those will cross into whatever I eat."}
{"text":"I've eaten here semi-regularly for a while. As others have mentioned, it's a good spot for drunken, after-bar snacks. I work nearby and sometimes stop in for a cheap lunch. The food is not good quality but it's also not terrible. I wasn't disappointed because I knew what I was in for. Before my experience yesterday, I probably would have given the place 3 stars. 

However, yesterday I stopped in hungry and thirsty after a long bike ride. I ordered some food and asked for water along with my meal. The guy on the register (who I think was the manager) insisted that I buy an overpriced bottle of water. I pointed out that they have plastic cups by the register and a water dispenser on their soda fountain. He replied \"Hey, we don't GIVE AWAY water, we SELL water.\" I think that's ridiculous. I'm not going to buy an overpriced bottle or pay for a sugary soda when there is a water dispenser right there. I was about to spend $6-7 on food, so it's no skin off your back to give me a 5 cent cup and enough water to fill it (costs less than 1 cent from the tap.) I walked out without buying anything and I won't be back. I think this restaurant is under new management, which might explain their change in attitude. I hope the new people figure out that being friendly and offering good value is the way to keep customers, not being rude cheapskates. I advise everyone to stay away from this place. The mediocre food is not worth the poor service."}
{"text":"Every so often, you just need a place to go to when you've had maybe one too many drinks and want something to soak it up with.  When that time comes, a place that's cheap, fast, and good seems like a mirage, especially as the clock approaches midnight.  Well, somehow Get Some Burritos seems to get all 3 right, and they're open until late enough into the night to satisfy most drunkravings.  

I had the Carne Asada burrito, while my colleague had the Badger Burrito (which is essentially the Carne Asada with french fries stuffed into it).  Watching the food being made in the open kitchen layout gave me a good feeling for what is otherwise a dark hole in the wall, and the finished product confirmed that everything was fresh and quite tasty.  I felt it well worth the additional upcharge from your assembly-line Taco Bell, which is what midnight drunk food runs would otherwise be made of.

All in all, this place wrapped up my night well, and I do expect to happily wander in here again in the future."}
{"text":"If you want a burrito that tastes like it's from a crock pot this is your place! I don't even know where to begin its just that bad. My Hispanic friends would go crazy if they had to eat this or a taco from this place. Conversely the girl at the front was super nice and the chips were the best part of the meal. I don't expect a lot but if I want to eat a frozen burrito with no taste I can go to grocery store. Multiple shots without question must happen before you order eats from here. Good luck people."}
{"text":"Terrible. The server didn't care. The food didn't even care. Beans = cold. Quesadilla = flavorless and missing the promised sour cream. No air conditioning. Keep walking people, keep walking."}
{"text":"I hate to do this because I always try to support small businesses when they are just starting up. But I simply cannot recommend this place. I came in  with a friend fairly excited expecting a California burrito with fries and the like, but that wasn't even on the menu. Instead we got bland and not particularly authentic Mexican food. 

PROS:  The beans were the only part of the items I tasted that actually tasted very good to me. The meat all seemed to be very high quality. The shredded chicken was good but a little under-seasoned.The inside was nice enough and the staff was kind. 

CONS: YELLOW AND WHITE SHREDDED CHEESE MIX that tasted like it was from Walgreens. I'm sorry but for me quality mexican food uses chihuahua cheese, queso fresco, or if they absolutely have to, high quality Monterey jack. The supermarket cheese blend was liberally thrown allover everything  in a misguided attempt to plate the food. On the nachos the cheese wasn't even melted. For the flauta, the fillings inside were cold, which was awkward because the tortilla was fried and piping hot. The quesadilla was were the cheese really disappointed me, when I paid  nearly $4 for a cheese only quesadilla I expect some good quality melty mexican cheese and lots of it. Instead we received something that would cost a dollar to make in a dorm-room or any place that has a microwave. 

OK: The guacamole is ok. It's without question very fresh, but I don't think its house-made. The chips were standard."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. It's just bad at everything. not authentic enough to be \"Mexican,\" not fresh or tasty enough to be cali style (like they claim). Soggy fries, microwave tasting quesadillas, yellow cheese (come 'on...) sprinkled a bit too liberally on everything, and fried food that manages to have a cold interior. 
The one tolerable thing here is the guacamole, which as mentioned tastes very fresh.  That said, it's not particularly well seasoned. The chicken is pulled not grilled, and okay too I guess. I tell friends to avoid this place literally every time I walk past it. Thats how active my dislike is for \"get some.\"

NOW TO BE FAIR, I have heard that this place is \"pretty solid when you're drunk.\" But I think thats a b.s. rationalization used for bad restaurants. There are at least 10 better drunk options. Call me insane, but I'd direct someone to PDR over this place."}
{"text":"I'm always excited about a new Mexican or burrito joint in town. I welcome the addition of GSB. My first impression is that it's a clean, friendly addition to the Madison burrito sweepstakes. The service and venue are great; the food, barely OK.

I ordered the chicken burrito and it was well-assembled with pico and chicken, minus the bean and rice fillers that most of us can do without and that I, in fact, usually omit when going to Chipotle or Qdoba or other burrito joints. 

The veggies and salsa were great -- they seemed fresh and had a nice kick. The chicken, however, tasted heavily salty and didn't appear to be the quality cuts of white meat that I would hope for. It reminded me less of Chipotle and more of Taco Bell. 

My suggestion for more stars would be to upgrade the chicken, but since GSB is a chain, this might be difficult to do. Don't try to hide lower-quality meat by salting. This might fool the 2:30 a.m. bar-time crowd, but not many others. While I'm not ruling out trying them again, I will pass on anything containing chicken."}
{"text":"One for free chips and salsa. Really hard chips and unimpressive pico de gallo are ok. 
I got a chicken taco midday and I unrolled the wrapper and was grossed out by the saturation of grease slopping all over the bag and wrapper. Inside the oily shell was some of the most repulsive chicken I've seen in my life. Hard and brown on the edges. Undercooked, soaking wet, smelly chicken. From my companions I received these reactions, \"I would rather eat pink slime chicken nuggets. \" \"as someone who feels awful about throwing calories in the garbage, you'll be doing us a favor if you take that outside to the garbage can.\""}
{"text":"I needed to grab a quick bite to eat after a long bike ride with my daughter, so I decided to finally try Get Some Burritos.  Hoping to get a light, healthy lunch, GSB seemed like the right choice, since their website proclaims they were founded on the principles of high quality food with the distinct flavor unique to the San Diego region.  Unfortunately, the high quality food tenant was lost in translation somewhere between the West Coast and Madison.  Instead of California dreaming, I found myself in a Taco Bell-esque nightmare of greasy ground beef, pre-shredded orange and white cheese and mounds of iceberg lettuce.  

I ordered two tacos for $4.69, one chicken, and one beef.  My daughter eschews meat, so she opted for the cheese quesadilla.  

I dug into the chicken taco first and it wasn't too bad.  The freshly made corn tortilla shell provided the requisite crunch, though the bottom of the taco was already soggy.  While lacking any heat, the shredded white meat chicken filling was moist and satisfying.

The beef taco was an unmitigated disaster.  I was expecting shredded beef, based on the on-line menu description of shredded taco.  I guess the shredded referred to the pile of shredded iceberg lettuce, because I got greasy, overcooked ground beef.  On the other hand, maybe the term shredded referred to the bland, dry, pre-shredded orange and white cheese.  Also missing from my meal was any of the traditional cilantro or onion garnishes associated with Mexican cuisine.  The shell disintegrated after one bite, leaving me picking the remains of the taco out of the puddle of grease that had accumulated at the bottom of my to-go container.  So much for my expectations of healthy California cuisine.

The cheese quesadilla also suffered from poor execution, with semi-melted cheese and a soggy tortilla with absolutely no crunch.  It had the texture of bubble gum and no cilantro or salsa to add any zip.  I suspect that instead of being heated on a hot griddle, it was warmed in a microwave.  

The person taking my order was pleasant.  I scored a free bottle of water by mentioning the word of the day that I pulled from their Facebook page.  However, when I asked for the wi-fi password, things fell apart.  None of the employees knew the password and when someone called the manager to find out; I was told there was no free wi-fi for guests.  When I showed them I was picking up a GSB Guest network on my phone, I was told the restaurant was under new management.  Welcome to Bizzarro World.    

While I appreciate the concept of California-style tacos and burritos, Get Some Burritos failed to deliver on that promise with poor execution and low quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I never do reviews on restaurants. I try to give the benefit of the doubt because I'm in the industry and I know It can be real trying at times. However, I ordered food delivered from this place and it was not edible. I ordered a good amount of food. You think Taco Bell is bad this place is horrendous. I ordered beef tacos and it was a very stale hard shell full of jerky like beef and crisp iceberg. I only took a bite because of curiosity. The nachos??? Forget it. Mystery meat at best. Took a bite and tossed it. This place serves below grade food....again. I don't write reviews ever but I don't want anybody to make the mistake I did. Go to Taco Bell and you will be better off. This place has no business serving food."}
{"text":"The out side doesn't give justice to the amazing food inside. What a rush of flavors and quality ingredients. I got the badger burrito it has no huge fillers like beans or rice just good meat, fries, pico de gio (that tastes like they made it fresh just for you) to the guacamole that is just amazing. ( I am not a fan of guacamole, but man you got to try this) even the fries that are in the burrito just add to the profile in your mouth. Better yet everything is spread out evenly so you don't get a bite of just one ingredient. 

Over all if your hungry get in and try this place I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Maybe I visited on the opposite version of an 'off' day because, unlike the majority of other Yelpers, I enjoyed my food here.

I appreciate the simplicity. Typically burritos are stuffed with excessive ingredients that I don't even want. Rice, beans, cheese, sour cream...no thanks. At Get Some Burrito, I didn't have to tell them to hold any of these copious toppings because the burrito came just as I wanted it. Simply stuffed with salsa/pico, guacamole, and your choice of meat. Perfection in a tortilla shell. 

For the price, my tummy was satisfied with the taste and the portion. This is certainly no classy burrito joint (if there is such a thing), but I could see coming here late night or when I'm on State and hungry for some quick, Chipotle-like food minus the long lines."}
{"text":"Started getting a stomach ache before I got halfway into my burrito. And the taste wasn't worth it. And the salsa wasn't spicy. And the place was freezing. Don't recommend at all."}
