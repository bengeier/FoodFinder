Place is so small but well decorated.
Service is general. Everyone looks like just doing their job.
A place you will always remember and go back."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on the four stars from Yelp, and all I can say is \"I pity the fools who thinks this is a four star place to eat\"

The food was mediocre and the service nonexistent. Had to ask five times to get a plate and utensils. The only good thing is the somewhat cheap price although I wouldn't pay for this no matter how cheap.

To top it off, when going to the washroom in the basement, the staff stores the raw dumpling filling uncovered and not refrigerated. 

I give this place two stars but think that's generous. 

If you really want a good dumpling place, try Ding Tai Fung in Markham."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, but the shop had very limited seating, so it's really cramped. Be prepared to wait a while for a seat, then you still need to wait for the food to be cooked. The good thing is everything is fresh.

{"text":"Dumpling quality have gone done over the years. Thick dumpling skin, minimal filling... 
The owner old lady even yelled at a table of customers today... Everyone was shocked... 
Will not visit again."}
{"text":"The fried dumplings are to die for! We only had dumplings for our lunch visit and started off with an order of fried pork and chive and steamed pork and fennel. The pork and chive are fried with a little batter so you get a nice honeycomb effect which keeps all the dumplings together and adds a beautiful crunch to each bite. The pork was flavourful and they were not dry at all.

Now the steamed dumplings were also amazing, but nothing could top the fried goodness of the previous. The steamed dumplings filling was extra juicy though, and you do get a few more for your money. We hoped to order a second round but the waitress quickly came over with the bill once finished as they had waiting customers which was a little unfortunate.

Being one of the cheap chinatown eats the place isn't the nicest looking nor the cleanest but you get what you pay for in chinatown...

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Sat down to try a collection of boiled and fried dumplings. The lamb dumplings were nice, but all in all, fairly standard. Despite all the hype, this place does not stand out for me."}
{"text":"Eat here. Huge portions. Great value. Place is small and very busy, so there may be a bit of a wait. The shrimp and pork dumplings are amazing- we had them fried. Also had the twice cooked pork which was so delicious and tender. Great menu, easy to order, and great service. Cash only."}
{"text":"This is my first time in the restaurant.  Boyfriend and I went during lunch time on a Friday.  Service was good.  We were seated promptly, and provided a pot of tea to warm up  with.   The food, however, were just mediocre.  Between him and I, we shared 30 steamed dumplings, and 2 green onion pancakes.  Our total came to about $27 (6.99 for 15 dumplings, 3.99 for each pancake and a ginger ale).  We both had the  \"sampler\", where you get 3 choices of dumplings.  We tried:  pork and cabbage, pork and chives, pork and fennel, lamb, shrimp and pork, and seafood - all steamed.  My boyfriend claims that everything tasted the same.  The differences to me are also subtle because there are more skin than filling.  I enjoyed the seafood the best because of the big pieces of shrimp in it.  But like everyone may have suggested, the pork and chives were the tastiest.  The green onion pancake was kind of disappointing.  To me, there was not enough green onion, and it was a bit dry.   

I still prefer Mother's Dumplings - I find the their dumpling skin is more delicate, and they have more variety."}
{"text":"We shared the pan-fried pork and chives dumplings, steamed pork and cabbage dumplings, a green onion pancake and the house special fried noodle.

The dumplings were delicious. Lots of flavors. I also enjoyed the noodles but was disappointed with the green onion pancake for its lack of flavors

Food came out fast which was nice since we were starving.

Oh they only take cash."}
{"text":"I had a crazy experience in here today. I cane for lunch with a friend and witnessed the owner going ballistic on a customer. The customers ordered a dish then cancelled and the owner freaked out basically trying to force them to pay for something they didn't want. It was unreal she actually chased them down the street. I will be avoiding this place in the future."}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled upon Dumpling House after taking a stroll around Kensington Market. It was just before 8:00 on a Saturday evening and there was a bit of wait for a table. While standing in line, we watched the dumplings being made, steamed, and fried. I initially craved for some steamed dumplings, but after seeing how crispy the fried dumplings looked...steamed dumplings were out of the question!

The restaurant is small and space is tight. Being a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, the service is quick. The servers were constantly on the move. They want people in and out fast, especially when there is a long line-up at the door.

We ordered Fried Pork Dumplings and Fried Chicken Dumplings, both of which were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. They were pretty good dumplings for the price we paid.

We also tried the Wood Ear Salad because one of my friend has never tried 'wood ear' before. I thought it was slightly overcooked, but the salad was nice and vinegary, just the way it should be.

I would recommend Dumpling House if you are looking for quick Chinese eats in the area (dine-in or take-out) AND if you don't mind dining in tight spaces."}
{"text":"The food tasted great I can't lie, but the fact that they tried to serve us burnt dumplings and got my order wrong the second time pissed me off and was quite inconvenient."}
{"text":"Fav dumpling place in downtown Toronto! tried several types of fried and boiled and they were all pretty good. 

Very cheap but expect to wait."}
{"text":"This place has more other nationality than Chinese, but it doesn't let me down at all. As a Chinese myself I always hate MSG in my food. This place has none of that in dumplings! Only complaint is this place is quite small, sitting is packed, and tables are slightly oily. But is a very nice comfort food!"}
{"text":"Great spot for cheap eats and solid veg dumplings.  A great place to gra a bite before some drinks in the market."}
{"text":"There dumplings were amazing. Probably the best dumplings I've had. However, I wouldn't recommend their scallion pancake. It wasn't worth the money"}
{"text":"Ordered dumplings pan fried and steamed. They were pretty good. Specially liked the prawn and vegetable ones. Its a very casual place and cash only. Worth a visit in chinatown."}
{"text":"Tried their steamed dumplings.  I'm a dumplings kind of person and I love how thin their dumpling skin is, and how juicy their fillings inside. The overall taste is very good and the price is reasonable. 

Their hot and sour soup is to die for. It's very delicious and yummy, really keep you warm during the winter."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here and the dumplings were good. But last time we were there ensured we'll never go back. Last time we were there we watched the owner (who appeared  to be sick) drop menus onto the floor and then pick them up without wiping them and then proceed to do each of these things multiple times: sneeze into his hand, spit phlegm into a napkin, wipe his nose, and apply some sort of nasal spray, without washing his hands once. He continued to handle all the food, take out, seat people. Could barely choke down our dumplings after that.


There's also countless reports of the owners screaming at each other and the customers, cockroaches on the floor and in the food. AND mistreatment of employees, including owners keeping all the tips and withholding pay as punishment."}
{"text":"Yummy food!

Better dumplings than Mother's Dumplings, which I always find sort of manqu√©. Whereas Mother's Dumplings tastes like Toronto, the Dumpling House tastes like being in Beijing, specifically, the old dumpling restaurant down by the Yongdingmen Train Station.

Dumpling House has fabulous fillings for their dumplings: fennel is particularly nice, and mutton great in the winter. Celery is amazing and delicate in the summer.

Other dishes are great, too -- the Onion Pancake, the cold cucumber salad, the potato starch dumplings, the spicy eggplant, and the hot-and-sour soup.

Serves is good and the owners and wait staff friendly."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto with family and my dad was eager to visit this place. We ended up visiting the place twice during our stay. So, yeah, this place is pretty good.

Relatively nice interior, a little cramped but honestly manageable. It's Chinatown. I enjoyed watching the ladies in the front rolling out the dough, and watching the cooks fry up dumplings. Their system is really quite efficient. 

We ordered the pan fried dumplings, as per recommended by many Yelp reviews. Delicious, super hot, and fresh. I also believe we tried some fried rice dishes(?), which wasn't too bad, but certainly not the best. However, I applaud them for getting the food out so fast. We went once during lunchtime (extremely busy!) and were surprised to see how fast our dishes had come out, steaming hot and delicious as ever.

I'll certainly drop by again the next time I visit Toronto. Prices are low, food is good. The only thing I recommend is to avoid the washrooms downstairs."}
{"text":"Great place for all dumplings. Had the fried pork and chicken dumplings, they were exquisite. Best bang for your buck relative to quality."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE Experience! If there is an option to give 0 star trust me I will. 

We've been there several times and the food was ok. The owner was yelling at his employee in front of all customers almost every time...Noticed that different groups of people work there almost every month (of course, who can live with his attitude?) The whole experience was ok until when we were about to leave (except the greasy chopsticks and table). I heard the owner talking with other customers who were waiting for our table that we were \"too slow\" (we were waiting for our dumplings for half of the time) and he wished he could get us out asap, and they were all looking at us like it's our fault?! Then the owner's wife came for the bill and she kept reminding us tipping was not included in the bill (she said like 10 times lol). I told her I didn't want to tip her because of the bad experience then she started to yell at us and throw the bill plate at the table. if it was one of their other employees that came to us for the bill I would of course tip them more than usual cause they are so poor to work for such horrible owners. She was pretty mad and won't stop yelling until we got out. 

Anyway, definitely won't go there again."}
{"text":"Quick, reasonable, and very good dumplings in the heart of China town. I think this says it all. It gets a bit crowded and noisy during peak hours.  If they served alcohol, I would have given them another star."}
{"text":"If you're walking down Spadina in Chinatown, you can watch them making dumplings from the window. Since I had a huge craving for dumplings, my friend and I decided to stop by.

We started out with the Steamed Shrimp & Pork Dumplings ($6.99 for 15). Unfortunately, like many others have mentioned, I believe these were boiled, rather than steamed. They were served quite wet still and since they were so plump and dense, it was difficult to picking them up with chopsticks. I found the skin to be a little to thick and the filling wasn't anything special.

We wanted to get some pan fried dumplings as well and settled on the Pan Fried Pork & Chive Dumplings ($5.99 for 12). The dumplings were served all connected together with a fried lattice net. I was afraid it'd be really greasy, but they surprisingly weren't. I loved the crispiness and the filling was moist and delicious. Loved this! Maybe we should have ordered the steamed dumplings with this filling instead.

We decided to supplement our dumplings with some Jellyfish - with cucumber and a mild spicy vinegar sauce ($5.99). Honestly, I don't know what we were thinking... this was just a bad idea from the get-go. When it arrived, we knew we had made a big mistake. This brown pile tasted as unappetizing as it looked. I like the crunchy texture of jellyfish, but this one was way too mushy and incredibly sour from the vinegar. It was as if this had been sitting in the marinade for days. Not good at all!

We also ordered some carbs - House Special Noodles - stir-fried noodles with chicken, beef, shrimp in brown sauce ($6.99). I don't know what \"brown sauce\" means, but it tasted similar to shanghai fried noodles...just not as good. The noodles contained a ton of minced garlic, which normally isn't a bad thing since I love all things garlic, however the amount of garlic was a little excessive as I could taste it in my mouth all through the night. 

So lesson learned. If a restaurant name has \"dumpling\" in it, just stick to the dumplings. Actually, the \"steamed\" (aka boiled) dumplings weren't even that great. Maybe just stick to the pan fried dumplings..."}
{"text":"Our family lives in Toronto and have been going here for quite a while. They took us last week and WOW were these WONDERFUL. The pork and chives pan fried dumplings were delicious. Hubby who has only tried steamed was a little leery of the dumplings but ended up trying and really liking them. We will definitely go back to the Dumpling House on our next trip to Toronto! We just wish we had this type of restaurant here in DC."}
{"text":"As if this place needs more raving reviews! My boyfriend and I waited in line for 15 mins over the weekend, but it was worth it. I agree with most reviewers that the pork and chive dumplings are amazing. We also had the mushroom and spinach dumplings, but they do not rival the pork and chive ones. I enjoyed the experience of coming to this restaurant and the service was good."}
{"text":"been here several times - it's kinda crazy in there but the food is very good, cheap, and fast. I crave it!"}
{"text":"So good - Handmade, delicious dumplings! We had steamed and fried dumplings, and enjoyed them both equally. Service was good and fast enough (for hand folding and boiling/frying). Would definitely recommend to any dumpling lover! Don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"YUM! We got the veggie fried dumplings, veggie fried rice, and veggie spring rolls. For all the vegetarians out there, there were many options on the menu! The portions were more than enough for two and everything was really flavourful. Service was quick and friendly. Between my boyfriend and I we spent $10 each (plus tip) and left satisfied. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is ok but the two owners were just shouting each other in front of all the people. Don't want to visit there again."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Hands down the BEST General Tao I have EVER had in my life... Nothing else compares so don't even try. I have been visiting this place since I discovered it pre-karaoke literally once a week  just to grab some Tao. Brought all of my friend circles to this place. Fast service, very kind and accommodating staff, and serving portions are well worth your money. 5/5 would visit again."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Always walked by and watched the staff prepare fresh dumplings at the front window. Always interesting to watch. 

Food is very affordable. Ordered 12 pan fried dumplings and 12 steamed dumplings and each order was only $6.99. They had a variety of combinations so we tried most of them. After a while they all started to taste the same, but the quality was really good. You can really taste how fresh each dumpling really is. 

The only reason I am giving this a 3 out of 5 star rating; was because the owner started yelling at one of his staff in front of all the customers. He yelled from the back of the restaurant to the lady (staff) in the front. The place went quiet for a bit and then it was back to business. Even though I could not translate what was said, we still found it unprofessional of him to do that.  

Other than that, everything was good. Would definitely go back again to try out other items."}
{"text":"As a Chinese , I can tell you that here is Really Great! Especially the wrapper! Great!"}
{"text":"Met our expectations.  After reading fellow Yelpers' comments, ordered both pan fried and boiled versions, but the waitress brought us only pan fried versions.  Presentation of pan fried dumplings was unique and pleasing, but flavor was unremarkable. Best choice was the three way combo that included a mushroom tofu version.  Not sure about the seemingly-artificially-colored hot sauce on the table. Place was generally clean.  Service was efficient on a hot noontime midweek. We are family of 4 from NH US and have traveled in search of best dumplings (especially xiao long bao aka \"soup dumplings\") including Flushing NY, San Francisco and throughout asia.  This place did not offer XLB, so cannot comment.

It appeared to us that this place and Mothers Dumplings close by were the highest rated, so we went to both on our whirlwind afternoon tour of Toronto Chinatown.

In the final analysis, we would return here but it wouldn't be our first choice."}
{"text":"The dumplings are decent. However, the service and hygiene is questionable. Also, the owner can often be seen yelling at the workers..."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken shanghai noodles, fried pork and chive dumplings, green onion pankcakes, and steamed shrimp and pork dumplings.

everything was very oily and they was not filling in the end. very good steamed dumplings but the fried dumplings were submerged in oil on a plate. 

would not come back here."}
{"text":"After recently moving downtown from Markham, I've been scouring the city for dumplings like the kind they have up there.

Stumbled upon this place at lunch time with high hopes...

Ordered various steamed dumplings which all ended up being 60% shell and 40% filling.  Not quite what I was accustomed to in Markham.

Then again, can't really complain for $8.

The search continues..."}
{"text":"Beware: Dishonest business practices! 

We were really craving dumplings and wanted to come here instead of other places. After all, this place got 4 stars from Yelp reviews. 

After ordering 3 different kinds of dumplings and the green onion pancakes, we were not satisfied. I ordered pork, shrimp and chicken dumplings, but they were not tasty at all! We asked for our bill and the owner \"intentionally\" gave himself a 35% tip.  Are you kidding me?! I am not a math genius but I do have a tip calculator app on my phone. 

This place is dirty with horrible service and the food was nasty. Run for your life and Go eat somewhere else! 

Lastly, be sure to Double check your bill before you PAY!"}
{"text":"One of mine and my husbands favourite places to go, the owner gives his hospitality in his own broken-English-charming-way!
The places is always packed and has the best dumplings in town, for a real decent price. 
Not a place if you expect the servers to hover over you tending to all your demands. No, go in, order your drink and food and stuff your face with goodness."}
{"text":"I definitely like this place better than Mother's dumplings. The first time i went i was under-impressed but my second visit there exceeded my expectations.

We ordered the lamb steamed dumplings (15), the spinach/mushroom steamed dumplings (15), and the pan fried pork/shrimp dumplings (12). Enough dumplings to make you feel OD-ed but it was not my decision to order so many.

The lamb dumplings were just ok. It still had a bit of the lamb taste so I didn't enjoy it. The spinach and mushroom dumplings could have used some more flavor. I didn't taste much of the mushrooms.  The best is the popular pan fried pork/shrimp dumlings.  You have to eat them by dipping them in a saucer filled with soya sauce, vinegar, and hot sauce. How to mix the right amount of each in the saucer is what can make or break your experience.

They make the dumplings at the front of the restaurant. Very authentic and labour intensive, hence everything is made daily and very fresh.

I highly recommend it. They have a few other popular dishes like the shanghai noodles and rice dishes that we saw at the other tables.

The bill turned out to be around $25 including tax and tip for 2 people. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


Raise your hand if you want a plate of fresh delicious dumplings for $6 that will probably satisfy two people. Ok, now raise your hand if you want quick, efficient service in a clean, well lit Chinese restaurant at Spadina and Dundas.

Dumpling House does it right. They are constantly pushing dumplings out of their pots and pans, which means the food is always fresh and made to order. While it can be a salty experience, it is also an extremely tasty one. They do an excellent job of serving tea and water, as well.

Try a plate of steamed dumplings and a plate of fried dumplings, and definitely go for meat (shrimp or pork appear to be the tastiest.) They offer other delicious pan fried dishes and soups as well. The twice cooked pork ($8) is surprisingly bold and excellent.

The only danger is that Dumpling House might get too successful and raise their prices or change their system. One can only hope they'll stay true.

4 stars"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, excellent value. Highly recommend: 
- Fried dumplings (especially the lamb, pork & chive, and spinach & mushroom)
- Steamed dumplings (especially the lamb, beef, and pork & sour cabbage)
- Baby bok choy in wine sauce (really garlicky)
- Cucumber in spicy sauce
- Shanghai noodle in brown sauce
- Spicy beef 

Service is efficient and fast. It's quite cramped and not at all fancy so don't expect bells and whistles. Cash only."}

{"text":"Some of the best Domplings I have had in awhile. I just dropped to this place by chance. I was just passing by and I saw the name and then dropped by to be surprised. I liked how fast they served me too... It just that it was a bit pricy. Other than that a good dompling for sure"}
{"text":"The food are below average.

But most importantly, THE BOSS IS SO RUDE and so mean to her workers. While we were waiting for food, she started to yell at a girl who works for her for no reason. Me and my frd are both understand Mandarin so that we know those insulting words she said were so so so MEAN and felt like a personal attack than blaming someone for work! And she spoke so loud that disturbing customers a lot.

Wont recommend this restaurant to anyone. Never!"}
{"text":"Om nom nom lamb fried dumplings. They are the best, so go order them!

So here's the deal: if this place wasn't so damn cheap and didn't have delicious lamb fried dumplings, it would get a 3/5.

The fried dumplings are tasty. Really! But not outstanding, and not \"I'm going to wait in line  outside in -25C weather for these dumplings\" amazing. 

So I specifically say fried dumplings because I tried an assortment of their \"steamed\" (I'm fairly confident that they're actually boiled) dumplings and they were forgettable. Avoid 'em. The fried ones are really good. They fry them with some... delicious batter? that fries to a crisp and it goes really well with a touch of soy sauce.

I've also had their hot and sour, and wonton soups. The former was pretty good, latter was good.

What sets this place apart from others is the quick service, low price point and the tasty, fried noms."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant, Dumpling House and the food was phenomenal! I would put a five star though the Service was good but could have been better. I understand that the restaurant is mostly busy and they are trying to encourage people to eat and leave asap so that the new ones can sit down but there are times where I have visited the restaurant and the place is half empty.

I still go to the place from time to time. I recommend to anyone who loves dumplings (as much as I do), just finished partying or work to come to this restaurant.
I would also like to recommend eating the chicken and pork dumplings and shrimp rice; it's a cheap place and there food is to die for."}
{"text":"We are only in town for 1 night and we were all really craving some good Asian dumplings. They picked a good name for the restaurant because this place makes phenomenal dumplings. We shared an order of steamed and an order of pan fried and they were so good. There cannot be a better plate of food at 1030pm. Great service as well. Staff kept our drinks full and we didn't wait very long."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. Tiny place but cheap and worth the wait!   

Hot and Sour Soup is a must-try! It's definitely one of my favourite spots for cheap food. I love their shanghai-styled noodles. Also, one of the few places that do pan fried styled dumplings (haven't seen anywhere that does them)! Pork and chives is definitely a crowd favourite!  

Dumpling types come in boiled (15 pieces) or pan-fried (12 pieces)."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Chinatown, Dumpling House serves freshly made dumplings while you watch them make them in the front window.  I loved the freshly made dough and the texture after it was boiled was perfect.  However, the filling wasn't as much or as flavorful as I would've liked.  We ordered the variety plate with lamb, pork and chives, and shrimp.  The lamb was outstanding.  It's rare to see lamb served in dumplings, and it really worked!  I kind of expected more from the other two.  They were just too bland, and the dumplings were barely filled. Still, this is a good restaurant, and I'd come back."}
{"text":"My SO and I was visiting Toronto for the week so we decided to definitely swing by here after reading the reviews considering most of the other Chinatown food we tried here was kinda blaaah. 
Everything was absolutely delicious! The veggie soup was delicious and you cannot go wrong whether you get the steamed or pan-fried dumplings, they're all delicious! The Singapore noodles were okay, but then again I don't think any Singapore noodles can top my father-in-law's =). This restaurant was one of the reasons why I was super sad to leave lol- we don't have anything restaurant in our Chinatown that serves dumplings like this!"}
{"text":"Have eaten these boiled and fried (depending on what the mood of my waistline is) 
Comes off as a busy cafeteria. Tight spacing, so don't expect any intimacy.
Dumplings are great, but I have had some that hadn't been mixed completely, very salty bites from several individual pieces."}
{"text":"I have been craving dumplings lately so my mom and I took a little journey into Chinatown and landed at the \"Dumpling House\".  We walked in wet with snow and it was packed.  It seemed that a lot of folks decided on the same journey to eat the home made dumplings that are on display being made in their front window.  They serve a wide range of dumplings, steamed, pan fried and prepared with a variety of different ingredients.  They also serve traditional Cantonese fare but don't stray and stick with their namesake items!"}
{"text":"For the price, it's good. I'd say only get the potstickers though...the way they cook it is very unique and quite tasty. Very oily though. I tried the black bean noodles and the steamed/boiled dumplings and I'd say that you should just go for the ppstickers. Being in downtown Chinatown,  the restaurant is disgusting and rundown. I was on the way to the toilets but had to stop halfway since it smelter horrid and looked like a horror scene. This is a place to grab a quick, cheap bite"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Toronto I always leave time for the dumpling house. This place reminds of being in Big Trouble In Little China and I always have a good time around this area. I found  the dumplings to be fantastic and fast. The place has always been busy but the only negative is the place is a little dirty but with the food being so good my eyes are glued to the plate. 

If you're having trouble deciding between steam or fried dumplings I would recommend the fried. The fried has a little more flavor and adding a little chile paste and soy sauce will help cut through the little bit of oil that is left on the dumpling. Always try the sampler platter so that way you can found out which dumpling is your favorite."}
{"text":"Food was fast, hot,fresh and filling. The staff aren't rude but they just get right to the point - get your order and serve it up. The storefront is quite small so don't blink or you'll miss it! Worth the search."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price but one problem is that they are not autistic friendly. Tried to rush us out as soon as possible. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"Lacking flavour. Pan-fried dumplings all taste the same. Non-dumpling items are better than dumplings. At a place called \"Dumpling House\", that's a bit of an issue...

Little gem of a place!"}
{"text":"from a morality perspective, I can't return - the owner verbally and physically abused his staff (I think it was his wife who is the dumpling cook) in front of everybody - people were saying that they would never return and I am doing the same!!! very disturbing. the \"owner\" said he didn't care about opinion when customers confronted him... yelling, making a scene... the guy is flat out dumb - shot him self in the foot big time!!! what an idiot. I feel sorry for the staff -- but DON\"T GO!!!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect mid afternoon spot to eat some delicious and fresh dumpling. Between the two of us we had the 15 steamed dumplings and chose the beef, pork and chive, and shrimp and veggie fillings and they were all so delicious. 

The restaurant was busy at 2:30pm and we were able to get a table without waiting. The restaurant was clean and the service was prompt, but the bathrooms were awful. The women's bathroom smelled like a pig sty. I will definitely go back and try the pan fried dumplings and some of the main dishes."}

-Tips are not shared with the employees - they go straight into the owner's pocket

Do not support a place like this. I won't be returning and I will tell all of my friends about the poor treatment of workers there."}
{"text":"Their pan-fried lamb dumplings were unique and tasty. The steamed pork dumplings were OK but nothing special. The scallion pancake was also nothing to write home about. The biggest problem was their service and the dining environment - it was fairly busy that evening, and they cramped everyone together like livestock. Most of the tables were joined together and strangers were packed into a tiny space with everyone's elbows just about touching. There was barely enough room on each table for the dishes. Annoyingly, this place is also *cash-only*, so be forewarned. In all, I think this restaurant is overrated on Yelp and while the food is decent, their service and dining environment is a huge turn-off and I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years , fried pork &chive ALL THE WAY !!! They need a debit machine though."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. The pork dumplings we ordered were boiled rather than steamed and were way too salty. And there was a lot of water on our plate from the boiling, which reminded me of the cheap frozen ravioli that are sold in grocery stores. I was looking forward to the General Tao chicken but was disappointed by the insane sweetness and batter overload. Fine, the place was very busy and all that could be forgiven but what really got to me was seeing one of its staff clean the tables with a very dirty and musty stinking rag that we could smell from our spot several tables away. I'm just so grossed out thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Dumplings and sweet chicken are amazing. Their beef soup is a bit tasteless and it's always crowded.. they should expand as is too tight sitting and walking. . Overall best dumplings in gta."}

CON: The place is very small, the service is not very good. True story: One time, they seated me and my friend near the kitchen. Then, they asked whether we could move near the front. We obliged. Then, AS WE WERE BITING INTO OUR FIRST DUMPLING, they asked us to move again to the other side. What gives? We were so upset BUT let's be real, we'll still come back, because:
PRO: The dumplings are so good and so cheap and so many.....!
I ordered take away many times too and they are also excellent. The only little thing is that the pan-fried dumpling has such pretty spider web / lattice thingy, but if you order it to go, then the lattice is gonna be broken, obv. :(
PS. Cash only"}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago, and the food is so good. Aside from their great and tasty dumplings, I really judge a Chinese restaurant by the quality of their hot and sour soup, which I really recommend too. The price is also really affordable for the portion sizes.

Downsides though are that it is a very small place (so hard for large parties), the dining ware is still kinda oily (so cleanliness may be questionable), and service is pretty typical of these type of restaurants. Overall, still recommended."}
{"text":"MY TO GO DUMPLING PLACE!

My bf and I recently tried this place after the price raise at Mother's Dumplings. I was apprehensive at first as I really liked Mother's Dumplings and did not have high hopes for Dumpling House. But I WAS WRONG. This place is fantastic! Their dumplings are still authentic, very delicious, cheeeeeap, and good portions! Not to mention, they have a huge variety of food other than dumplings. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"We had the Zha-Jiang Noodles, beef stew dumplings and pork chive fried dumplings.  Everything was authentic and super tasty.  Can't wait to try some of their other dishes.  We will be back here many many times!"}
{"text":"Was here on a Friday night so, there was a bit of a line but it did not take long to get seated. You can see staff at the front making the dumplings (rolling out the wrappers and stuffing them). This place is old and run down but, I was here for the food anyways so, to me, it didn't matter! There were signs that said \"cash only\" that looked old but, I did not confirm if they had a debit or credit machine...so, just remember to take cash with you! lol not apple pay or other forms of modern monetary transactions...good 'ol hard cash...

The server was very pleasant and everything came out hot and fast! They typically start you off with water so, if you want tea, you have to ask for this. I did not try the pan fried dumpling but, from what I saw peering at other tables, it looked good and was not greasy. You can also buy frozen dumplings to take home. 

Steamed Pork and Chive Dumpling - 5/5 (Amazing. Been to several dumpling places and this is one of the better ones. The wrappers are nice a chewy and the meat actually tastes like pork! It wasn't too fatty.)

Shanghai Noodles - 4.5/5 (They got this right. Ordered this because every table we looked at had this on their table. Reconnaissance prior to ordering paid off here. Docked off 0.5 because it was a bit too greasy...)

General Tao Chicken - 1/5 (YUCK. Although they used white meat, it was cocooned in a thick blanket of batter so you really had to dig for it. Think of chicken balls from Manchu Wok except oblong shaped. The sauce was not appetizing either...If you want General Tao, would recommend sauntering across the street to Swatow.)"}

Try the hot and sour soup and soya been curd! Mothers down the street sucks"}
{"text":"This is a fast made to order dumpling restaurant in center of chinatown. The service and food on table time is efficient. we had the pork and chive steamed dumplings which were juicy and hot. Very good dumplings!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to try dumplings and they were aamzinnnggggg! 

This is a cute little place located in China town. The place is very small and there was a huge line up of people waiting to be seated. I was there with a party of 4 and we were seated pretty fast. 

We ordered a variety of boiled and fried dumplings. Everything tasted pretty good. I would highly recommend visiting this place if it's your first time trying dumplings. OH best thing about this place is how cheap it is!!! For the amount of food we had, we each paid $8 and then added tips on top. 

Would visit this place again!!"}
{"text":"I was here last week. Food was sub-par, everything on the very salty side. When it was brought to attention, the store manager came over to my table and started yelling at my party in Mandarin. This went on for a while and it was quite awkward, we tried to talk back in English but she didn't care.

Immediately got the bill and left."}
{"text":"When I travel to different city I try to visit China town and find the best food. Dumpling House by far is one of the best I've ever tried. The way they present the dumplings is so different. Sorry NY city and San Francisco so far the number one dumpling restaurant is in Toronto."}
{"text":"Bring  a large appetite with you  to enjoy this incredible restaurant!  Not only do they provide large portions, the quality and taste of there menu is Excalibur!
The restaurant fills quickly when they open.  There was a line when we went for lunch.
It is well worth the line to enjoy the gastronomic delicacies.  The staff are very  accommodating.
Get ready for a lunch that you will remember for a long time."}
{"text":"Pan fried dumpling tasted great, but stuffing is too little; meat dumplings tasted so much better than the veggie ones. 

The boiled chive and egg dumplings are too salty for me. The wait is long maybe due to the fact that it's a Saturday."}
{"text":"I'm always in the mood for dumplings. We originally wanted to try another place but we passed by this place first so we tried it. It was packed even when it was only 5:30pm. The place was not that big and the tables were very cramped together. We got a table right away but then the people afterwards had to wait. The service was very quick as they want a quick turn around to free up the tables. Lots of servers running around and the boss was there so if any of them had a moment of freedom, she will tell them what to do.

We ordered these dishes:
- hot & sour soup - decent authentic compared to the other ones I had, not too spicy, lots of sesame oil
- pan-fried pork and chives dumplings - very hot and crispy on the bottom of the dumpling. The dumplings are actually not sealed so there is opening. Very tasty, didn't need to add soy sauce at all
- steamed pork and cabbage dumplings - freshly steamed, hot and juicy in the inside.
- green onion pancake - freshly made, very crispy and flaky

All the dishes were very good, The food came pretty quickly and price is cheap, portions are decent. They were really rushing to get you out. The moment our plate was empty, they took it away. I felt so pressured eating, like all eyes were watching me and I couldn't even finish my tea as they were cleaning up my table."}
{"text":"For me, this is the best Pan Fried Dumpling in Toronto! Not sure about other items in this restaurent, but the pan fried dumpling is a must. I like their pan fried dumpling is beautiful golden colour and stick together. A bite the dumpling, the juice coming out is amazing delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, very cheap..service isn't great but my former comments make up for it"}
{"text":"Pan fried dumplings, Pan fried dumplings, Pan fried dumplings, Pan fried dumplings, can't say this enough. 

NOT the

Boiled dumplings


Order the pan fried dumplings and you'll have a better food experience here. 

It was the best pan fried dumplings I've ever had in the city. Shrimp and pork. There's no messing around with these, they are made fresh by the ladies at the front and then fried. They are served on a plate piping hot and each dumpling is connected like a lattice. See my pics. 

I also ordered the Chicken Soup too. Something like $7 dollars for this oddity, nothing like mom used to make. Features fresh wheat noodles (ganmien), large pieces of chicken, and carrots. The bowl has enough contents to feed 3 hungry people. I was at it for 10 minutes and didn't make a dent. It's a good choice to go along with something dry like the dumplings. 

Inside - it's a tight space, but the red interior is well appointed and much nicer than you think from the outside. 

GOT DUMPLING?  as the neon sign outside say. They sure do."}
{"text":"Finally finished school for the summer and first stop...CHINATOWN!

These dumplings have been on my list of places to hit for a while, got the chance to cross this one off with my ever willing girlfriend =). 

We chose to get 15 dumplings divided evenly between:
Steamed - 
Mixed veggies
Black mushroom and spinach 
Chicken 

Final price was ~$7

Quality of the dumplings was superb and the time spent cooking them was only 10 mins. Service was great given that it was a takeout order.

{"text":"Cheap, freshly made, and delicious! This is a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner. Watching them make the dumplings is quite fascinating!"}
{"text":"So I lived in Beijing for 8 months and would eat dumplings at least three times a week.  Five kuai roadside dumplings, fancy purple ones, you name it, I've tried it. 

When I left I was REALLY upset about the prospect of never tasting the same calibre of dumplings again so I did a quick google search and came across Mother Dumplings. Wooee the Mother of all Dumplings? Well guess what -this mother has neglected her children because the whole experience was extremely underwhelming. 

In search of a new source to satisfy my dumpling addiction I came across Dumpling House. I'm glad to announce that these have been the best dumplings I've had in Toronto so far. Perfect thickness of jiaozi dough, great fillings, and superb chilli for your vinegar-chilli dipping combo. Four stars, because I want to remain credible, but in my head it's really 5."}
{"text":"Way better than mom's dumps and anybody who says otherwise is a hater"}
{"text":"These are by far the best dumplings I have found in the area (way better than My Mothers Dumplings). Not only are they good but cheap as well, I buy 3 dozen frozen pork and chive dumplings for $10 including tax and cook them myself at home."}
{"text":"VERY RUDE, I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. The experience was so bad that it made me register my first Yelp account JUST FOR WRITING THIS REVIEW.

I was travelling from USA, so I have only credit card and some US dollars. I don't think there is any sign outside or inside the restaurant saying that it's cash only. If I saw one, I would definitely not go. I don't understand why many restaurants in Toronto don't accept credit card. That's ridiculous.

When I finished my meal and was going to pay, the person there (a mid-aged man) was very rude. He almost yelled at me saying that they don't accept credit card. Since I have only US dollars, I asked them whether I can pay by US dollars. He said yes I could, but I had to pay EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT IN US DOLLAR AS IN CAD. That's ridiculous!, but I had no choice, so I had to do what he said. I paid the SAME AMOUNT IN US DOLLAR AS IN CAD.

I was feeling like being rubbed. I have to give them my money, even thoughI don't want to, and they don't deserve it!"}
{"text":"Good quick service. Decent prices for what you get . Service was quick and above average for a chinatown restaurant"}
{"text":"Really great food and a great price. Had the steamed and fired dumplings the both tasted great however I preferred the fired dumplings."}
{"text":"By far the best dumplings in Toronto, the pan fried pork and chive we're absolutely out of this world!

Other then the dumplings, the main dishes such as the Gung Bao Chicken, Black Pepper Beef, Ten Ingredients Fried Rice, are delicious and they come hot and fast to your table. 

Incredible service, incredibly tasting food, and insanely good prices. 
You will NEVER leave this place unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Shared an order of pork and chives dumpling (steamed, 15 pieces) and an order of Singapore fried noodles with the bf. The dumplings were very fresh and soupy inside. The noodles were ok, I've had better but it's not bad for the price. 

Definitely should come here for fresh, well made dumplings!!"}
{"text":"Just amazing. If you're looking for authentic at amazing pricing, don't go anywhere else. Pan-fried dumplings are well-packed and has great flavor. Yes it will be oily but that's why you don't eat this stuff every day. For the amount of money they charge you the quantity of food is extremely generous. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Passed by this place and saw people making dumplings and decided to give it a try. They were delicious! I love the fried dumplings. Perfect place for a late lunch."}
{"text":"reliable and predictable - simple and straightforward menu - about a dozen different dumpling types - steamed or fried, and a special item you can pick 3 assorted types of dumplings.  Home-made hot sauce on the table, with hot mustard and sweet/sour sauce.   Comfort food, asian style."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in the city.  Try any of the pan-fired dumplings, which come on a single, lacy net of fried dough.  And it's super-cheap!"}
{"text":"We live near NYC and often go to Chinatown to eat. I can't believe I'm saying this but this restaurant was so much better than our usual places in NY. 

The dumplings were delicious! They make them in the front of the store. The won ton soup was AMAZING! We also loved the beef noodles. The general Tso's chicken was exceptional despite the look of the dish...see pic.  

It was one of the best meals we had in Toronto. That being said, our waitress was a bit rude and not very attentive but that won't prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"C'est tout petit. De la rue, vous voyez ces dames qui fabriquent les beignets en quantit√© industrielle avec une pr√©cision microm√©trique.

{"text":"The best Resturant for kids and the family. Alittle hot hot during summer. We went at 6pm and it was waaaay to hot for us to eat. Though the price is reasonable and the food is super good. The boiled dumpling is awesome."}
{"text":"This place has one of those window display off the street where people can watch the guys make dumplings.  So, you would think the owner would make it super clean and appealing like the ones in Ding Tai Fung, but not!.  It kind of grossed me out.  However, we were on vacation and our friends wanted to try it.  So we went along with it.  I ordered a spicy beef noodle soup and wife had pan fried dumplings.  If you like lots of noodles, this is the place. There were lots of noodle but very little beef in the spicy beef noodle soup.  We don't recommend this place and probably won't be back on our next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I would give this place 11 stars if I could.

The dumpling house has by far the best dumplings on the planet.  A coworker of mine convinced me to give it a try nearly a decade ago, and I've been back literally hundreds of times since.

The service can be a bit sketchy at times due to employees whose English is not great, and the fact that the place is pretty much always hopelessly packed.  Don't let that deter you.  They have the best dumplings, and their fried rice is pretty amazing too.  I recommend the 10-ingredient fried rice.  They put everything in it, and they don't skimp."}
{"text":"Dumplings were ok. Not much better than the frozen dumpling that you can find in typical Asian market. I guess it is a little better because they are made fresh and really cheap. 
It was super crowded when I was there and the restaurant has no AC."}
{"text":"My favourite dumpling place!! Whenever I walk by it's always packed and I know why. Now whenever I'm craving dumplings I try to get my friends to come here."}
{"text":"Perfect. Exactly what you would expect for cheap dumplings on Spadina. 
Service is actually pretty good for the prices and type of establishment. 
Get the mix of three dumpling combo. So cheap! Shanghai noodles and Singapore noodles are exactly what you would expect as well. The perfect hangover cure.

**Also to the review complaining about the US dollar exchange rate...wtf?! You're in a different country! No business is even required to accept your foreign currency and those that do usually exchange AT PAR. Change your money when you travel and use the LOCAL CURRENCY! Ridiculous.**"}
{"text":"These dumplings are delicious! I regularly see the manager there and he is always very friendly and happy to serve us. Note that this is a small place that gets filled up fast. They also do takeout"}
{"text":"The steamed dumplings are rather senseless. The fried ones are nice and come on the plate inverted with a lacy coating of fried dumpling starch linking them together which is crunchy and flavorful. 

If you want dipping sauce of any kind not on the table they will supply it, though my requested crushed garlic in soy cause was inexplicably green in color.

The meat dumplings contian little meat an dyou will be hungry soon after."}
{"text":"It's early evening on a Wednesday. My hubby was willing to return to King's Noodle with me, but something strange compelled him  to \"strongly encourage\" trying the Dumpling House. Maybe it was the fact that at 5pm the only patrons were young white guys -- the only Asian women in the restaurant were staff members, or significant others of said white guys. There didn't appear to be much variation in the types of foods everyone ordered: a selection of steamed dumplings (12 pieces for about $6) and fried dumplings (again, 12 pieces for about $6). You can mix and match fillings such as pork with veggies, pork with sour cabbage, pork with shrimp, spinach and mushroom, group beef, chicken, and even minced lamb (the latter was not very good), I usually like my dumplings served in a steamer on top of a bed of Chinese cabbage. Dumplings should house a little bit of a savory, vinegar based soup, of which the diner has to find a way to get the soup to your mouth without breaking the dumpling and spilling the soup (that's a party foul). Two people, one canned soda, and 24 dumplings cost about $16 CAD."}
{"text":"Great food at an awesome price, I treat myself once a week or so to something as simple as their Chicken Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Chicken, which only cost $18 and is enough food for 2 people, or two dinners in my situation. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, excellent prices, top of the line quality of food.

I've gone to this venue twice, and I was very impressed with it both times. The staff was very friendly, the prices haven't gone up in at least a few years (which is very surprising considering the area), and the dumplings are always delicious.

The only thing I'd improve is that it's a cash-only place, so if they could accept credit and/or debit cards, that would make it even better.

Never-the-less, I'd definitely return to this venue."}
{"text":"The place was really busy when we got there but we were seated almost immediately (although we shared the round table with two other people). Walking in, you can see where they are making the dumplings fresh! 

The steamed dumplings come 15/order and pan fried 12/order. Everything is pretty much $7.99 but they have a 3-flavour option for both types of dumplings for $8.99 so of course we opted for that. Out of what we ordered, everything with pork was great! The lamb and seafood ones were also very good. We also got a shrimp with veggie but compared to the other ones, it was very bland, so I wouldn't pick that one again. The spinach and mushroom was also a bit more bland but it was good anyway. 

The only thing I didn't quite like about the food was that the pan-fried ones were still super oily when the order came to us. I wish they let them drain a bit more before throwing them on a plate (although all the food came very quickly and it was great that way). The other thing is, our bill came out to $20.35, and we were just going to leave $25 total, but when we gave $25 to the server, she didn't ask if we wanted change (we didn't say keep the change either) and then she never brought us change back! It's not a big deal since we were planning on leaving it anyway, but why they would just assume it was all tip is beyond me.. 

Overall, great place, cheap, fast, and delicious! Would definitely return. Oh and cash only!"}
{"text":"The best dumplings in Toronto. Their fried dumplings are AMAZING - no other dumpling place has fried dumplings that are this satisfying. They are CASH ONLY, so keep that in mind when visiting. 

Service is fast. The place isn't very clean, but you can't expect much in terms of cleanliness in Chinatown. Servers are nice enough. Overall, 10/10 would return."}
{"text":"May be the best dumpling places I've ever been to. Incredible price, great tate, I'll be back on future Toronto visits."}
{"text":"I don't want to sound racist, but if you scroll down the reviews list, you will see that there doesn't seem to be many Chinese reviewers of this place.  When I saw that the clientele was 70% non-Chinese I should have turned around and walked away.  I have a sneaking suspicion that recipes have been tampered with to westernize (or in my opinion bastardize) the menu.

See, I grew up on dumplings and have become a bit of a dumpling connoisseur if you will...and these dumplings were just plain awful.

The only thing I liked was the fact that I could order several different flavours in one order.  But this just led me to surmise that nothing really tasted that good here.

The spinach and mushroom dumplings tasted strange and lacked real Chinese flavour.  It tasted more like a greek dish with a chinese wrap on the outside.

The pork and shrimp were mediocre at best.  

The black vinegar provided was the worst kind I've ever had.  Not fragrant as it should be, just really sour.

Although the presentation of the pan fried dumplings was unique, the terrible stuffing inside was a total disappointment.

I can't believe even the hot & sour soup was a write-off.  I've never had hot & sour soup that tasted so sweet and not so hot . They should call it sweet & sour soup which would definitely win the caucasian crowd who seem to love all things sweet & sour (okay, I know that's a gross generalization).

Lastly, even the soy milk was off.  It had some kind of extra flavour in it.  It's like they sweetened it with some sort of fruit syrup.  It was so bad I returned it (which they thankfully allowed me to do).

Dear people, please try some more dumpling places and then come back here to see the difference.  In particular...my personal favourite is Dumpling King in North York.  They have the best handmade wraps, the most flavourful stuffings, and the vinegar on the table is excellent, never mind the chill oil.

It actually makes me mad to think that so many people think such terrible food is excellent...\"the best you ever had.\"  Really, this place is like the equivalent of chicken balls for authentic Chinese dumplings."}
{"text":"Wonderful eggplant with garlic sauce - my fave. The dumplings are also great. I don't think I've had anything bad at this restaurant. Cash only but it's worth it. Sundays may be hard to get seating."}
{"text":"Definitely the best dumplings in town! They are freshly made and they taste really good! The plates are huge and the prices are really low! 

We ordered a take out twice and we were not disappointed! 

You can also see them making the dumplings in front of you :)"}
{"text":"3.5/5
Dumpling house is my go to place when I am looking for a satisfying hearty meal. But this visit was not that great. The food were good as usual, the price were raised as expected within a reasonable range. What took 1.5stars away was the female owner.

I was with a group of 6. We sat pretty close to the cashier. Ever since we sat down all I hear was the female owner scolding a new waitress loudly. Poor girl, she was a good job. The owner was yelling at her so loud made all of us fell bad for the girl. Our conversation were constantly interrupted by her yelling at the girl. Made the whole dinner very unpleasant. Training newbie is understandable, but please do remember there are customers here enjoying their meal, I was scared a few time by her unexpected loud voice. Keep it low please, seriously. That really put me off.
Asides from that, the food were good. Pan fried dumplings with horse radish were bomb. 

Hope the owner or some one who know them see this, I would've told her to be nicer to the new waitress, but I was afraid she would rip me apart.  :( treat your workers nicely, respect them!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! I'm going to keep this one short and sweet. I've been here 5+ times and I'm always left satisfied. 

THE GOOD:
- Their dumplings are freakin' delicious. Period, full stop. If it's your first time, I recommend the fried pork and chive dumplings. Don't make a rookie mistake like me during my first visit and go on an ordering frenzy - each order of dumplings comes with 12 pieces, and while they are small, they will fill you up quickly.
- On that note, there's an open space in the front window where you can watch the dumpling ladies at work. They're definitely masters of their craft, and it's fun to see them in action.  
- Like most of Chinatown, Dumpling House Restaurant has good ol' Chinatown value. Last time, my boyfriend and I ordered a fried rice, a spicy beef dish, and 12 pork and chive dumplings for $27 before tax and tip. This was more than enough food for the two of us. 

THE BAD:
- Cash only. Not a dealbreaker - just remember to bring cash if you're coming.

I think my multiple visits speak for themselves - Dumpling House is bomb food for a bomb price. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This was a great place in china town. It was really neat to see behind the dumpling making and kitchen area. 

We got a wonton soup, Shanghai noodles, and the pan fried dumplings. The wonton soup was magnificent. That alone would of gotten a 5 star. However I found the Shanghai noodles and dumplings to be too oily. Flavor was great but they were slipping and sliding all over. I also found the noodles a tad too sweet with plum sauce."}
{"text":"This is the best dumpling joint by far in the china town, especially the deep fry dumpling, very authentic and delicious. But the side dish is a little bit on the downside. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Fried dumpling was very good, i did not liked spinach and mushroom one, but chicken and beef both were good... although fried noodle was greasy but it was good... prices were reasonable , staff were cleaning the floor in the middle of noon and it made me think i shall leave so they can do their cleaning which was not pleasent
i will try this place again"}
{"text":"You eat until you feel like you're going to explode you're so full, and then you just keep eating. 

4 of us got 15 pork and chive steamed dumplings; 12 pork and chive fried dumplings and then 12 assorted fried dumplings: pork and chive, mixed vegetable and black mustroom and spinach dumplings as well as noodles - everything was gone. 

The price is $6.99 for 15 dumplings so very reasonably priced, and the service is good."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!! BILL MISCALCULATED - ADDED A FEW MORE DOLLARS than should have. 

We told the owner and server that the bill was calculated wrong and they shrugged it off like it was nothing. They didn't apologize or say, \"let me correct it for you\". Because of that.. we didn't bother tipping. 

It's SUCH A PITY because the food was pretty good... especially having eaten American food all week long. The reviews were sooo great that we were actually excited to eat at this restaurant. 

Service:
Poor... they all gave me attitude and when I asked for something, they looked like they didn't want to bother helping. 

Also... NO HIGH CHAIR = NOT BABY FRIENDLY. Don't even think about bringing your kids unless you have a high chair to bring yourself. 

Food quality: 
Dumplings were definitely freshly made. The ingredients were good. I liked the fried dumplings because it had a really yummy skin and extra crunchy pieces on it. 

Boiled dumplings were good too. Great variety and flavors. 

Onion pancakes were the best I've ever had - probably because of the lard."}
{"text":"My go-to place for dumplings in Toronto. In my opinion, they have the best dumplings in town. I've tried Mother's Dumplings, Dumpling King and Northern Dumpling Kitchen but I always end up going back to Dumpling House.

Unfortunately, I no longer live in Toronto so I try to get my fix every time i'm back in town, My favorite are the pan-fried ones. Greasy but oh so good. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Like others have mentioned, my go-to are the pork and chive stuffed dumplings. The pan-fried textural aspect set them apart from others.

The boiled ones are very good too. The flavors are more subtle and the stuffing ingredients can really be appreciated. Make sure you eat them while they're still hot though, since the wrapping can quickly become hard and doughy.  

Sticking  with dumplings is the best idea. I find their noodle dishes to be on the sweeter side and geared towards more \"Westernized\" tastes. However, they also have some quality non-dumpling dishes such as the cucumber & garlic salad, marinated jellyfish salad and their fish-fragrant eggplant dish."}
{"text":"Pan fried dumplings are awesome, with the crispy \"flower\" crisp.  I am not a big fan of it's pork and fennel dumplings but the vegetarian ones were great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese food shops in Toronto.  If you want something that tastes good but is not necessarily good for you then I would recommend a visit.  Sometimes I get desperate for lamb fried dumplings, Shanghai stir-fried noodles and thousand year old egg on tofu that I ditch my car in the no parking zone outside and order take out.

The service is good by Asian standards.  I would recommend Mandarin in the shop as Cantonese appears to cause confusion."}
{"text":"I have found the Holy Grail of dumplings and it's located in Chinatown, Toronto!

Omg! This place is so awesome! I absolutely love dumplings and had to give this place a try. We walked in and waited for 10 mins to be seated. The service here is really fast so you will never have to wait too long. The menu has a list of dumplings but it also has a lot of other things. You can get the dumplings steamed or fried, we chose steamed. Its around $7 a plate and you get 15 pieces. We as usual ordered too much in our hunger and were left with three plates of dumplings (lamb, minced chicken and shrimp&veg). We also got the house noodles. The house noodles were excellent and so were the chicken and lamb dumplings. The shrimp was my least favourite but the lamb is definitely going to be my staple order.

Just righting this review is making me crave more dumplings, its very reasonably priced and the quantity is just amazing! You will leave with a heavy tummy and a not-so-light wallet ;)

PS: Don't forget to take cash."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place, 'cause as a vegetarian, my dumpling consumption has been limited.  When I saw the raves for the veggie options here, I thought I'd give it a taste test.

The two choices, mixed veg or spinach and mushroom, were a tad on the bland* side, but were good vehicles for the sauces, both soy and chili.  

The hot and sour soup was good.  It was smokier than any other I've tasted, and it's heat was good, both spice- and temperature-wise, but my bowl had a large glob of unidentified, gelatinous matter (probably un-blended corn starch).

If you like dumplings, you'll probably like this place.  First timer?  Try both steamed and fried versions.

*My friend assures me that the lamb version is \"dump-licious\"!"}
{"text":"So good! This place was jam packed on a late Sunday morning and we were the only non asians inside.  Servers were friendly and attentive despite the language barrier and the dumplings were soooo amazing and cheap.  We didn't have a hard time finding parking nearby."}
{"text":"For $3, the 'small' soup is big enough for 3. For $6 the 12 steamed dumplings are a steal.  We walked in here while touring Toronto for a unique experience. I read the Yelp reviews and felt good about going in. I had read good things about the green onion cake, which wasn't as interesting as I had hoped it would be - more pancake, not enough onion.  
The steamed spinach and black mushroom dumplings were a crowd favorite.  With a little soy and chili sauce these things are the best lunch ever. The pan fried dumplings are 'fried' in a pan with something else to create a shell that holds the dumplings all together in formation.  The shrimp and vegetable dumplings, we saw them being made on the way in, have one little shrimp in each.  The texture was nice, but they were saltier to begin with, but didn't have as much flavor. 
By the time we left, there was a line out the door of people- asian and non-asian waiting to get in."}
{"text":"Place is legit. Prices are great. Plan to visit more than once to try all the dumpling fillings. 

Dumpling House also has \"I need to sit down for a moment\" level Zhajiangmian. Don't speak Chinese? Match this up to the menu and ask for it by number: ???.

Those noodles change lives."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot to go and grab some steam dumplings if you want you can try up to three different flavors in a 15 dumpling platter. Our high asses ate this food in 11 god n minutes and not gonna lie it didn't fill us up but the codes amazing and the steam was like a fire. I recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"The place has been renovated and it looks fantastic!  The theme is bold and dragonishy red/ black.  Looks really great :)

3 orders of dumplings and 4 dishes for $56.  Once again, the dishes were \"meh\" but the dumplings were fantastic - going to stick with the dumplings from now on.

PS - this place only takes cash."}
{"text":"Serious dumpling place. And I am a dumpling fanatic. Soups are also authentic and tasty. Solid. And I didn't even tried the fried dumplings which seems to be the star dish here. Prices are ridiculously low. Definitely in my list of go to places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great value for the dumplings, averaging about 50 cents or so for one. The pan fried ones are the best due to the crunchy factor.  Its odd though that they have mustard and sweet n sour sauce in the red squeeze bottle. I've never seen this before in my life.   I guess a lot of their customers ask for it. But as an Asian person I think it's just very very wrong.  There should be only hot sauce or ketchup in a red squeeze bottle!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I went here yesterday for lunch and it was great. Service was OK but food was awesome. I should have checked the yelp reviews before I went as I ordered all steamed dumplings (shrimp/pork and seafood) while they were good, some of them were soggy or sprayed hot water at you when you cut into them. The chicken noodles were fantastic and the mushroom bock choy was pretty good.

Will go here again as the food was yummy and my wallet liked the prices. BUT I will try the dumplings pan fried next time :) Looking forward to going again"}
{"text":"yum! so delish. I agree with other reviewers about the fried dumplings. They are so crispy and very tasty. Place is small but service is fast and efficient. I am returning. it is a must!"}
{"text":"No complaints at all. We had the Shanghai noodles, which were surprisingly good. Some people might find it a bit oily, but I thought it tasted super good. I have a huge love for  dumplings and the dumplings were obviously great ( we had the pork and chive). I prefer pan friend dumplings over steamed.  Good cheap eats, fast service, can easily imagine myself being back frequently!"}
{"text":"Fried dumplings are very crispy and tasty, good for a quick bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The chili sauce here is much better than at Mother's Dumplings...but the dumplings not so much.  We ordered the steamed pork & chive, it was more like boiled dumplings and not steamed.  The pan fried vegetarian dumplings had a nice crunchy texture on the outside, but the filling lacked any real flavors.  Not bad for a quick meal.."}
{"text":"Restaurant is tiny. Service was mediocre.
The girls didn't speak English, ignored us a few times.. But in their defense they did have a full house with a line up.

4 stars because it's all about the food! And the food was freaking awesome. The pan fried dumplings are so good. Had the shrimp and pork panfried dumplings and pork and chives pan fried. I had steamed before but I know pan fried is what's known here at the dumpling house. Dumplings was nice and crispy yet tender and juicy. The shanghai noodles were surprisingly flavourful and great as well.

If service was better then this tiny Chinese restaurant would definitely be a 5 star"}
{"text":"Great steamed dumplings! We had the pork and fennel, and pork and shrimp kinds, as well as the green onion pancake. Dumplings were a bit on the heavy side, but tasted great. Green onion pancake was very oily but delicious if you're not counting calories. Good value at $8 for 15 dumplings. Too bad they don't have soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"My Last night in Toronto, I was in Chinatown and really wanted dumplings so came here. We ordered choice of three for both streamed and pan fried. We had steamed beef,chicken, and shrimp & veg. For pan fried we had lamb,beef, and shrimp & veg.  We also ordered green onion pan cake. I feel I had high hopes from the place because people tell me how Toronto's Chinese food is better than Montreal's and I had really good dumplings in Montreal. The steamed dumplings seemed to have been boiled instead of steamed and did not have the hot broth soup on the inside. They tastes fair. Green onion pancake was alright as well. I was super disappointed with the hot sauce (my favourite part of a dumplings meal); the sauce was thick and tangy and not hot at all. The hot sauce combined with the soy sauce made me feel very bloated afterwards and I did not leave be place with a good feeling."}
{"text":"I was still hungry after a long day of touristing and carousing and dumplings sounded splendid. This place was a quick walk from where my husband and I were staying in Kensington Market, so walk we did!

We ordered twelve pan fried dumplings, three different varieties, and a much larger than expected order of wonton soup. The dumplings were perfect (especially the lamb!) with that delightfully perfect crust on the top. I think we could have had twelve more after finishing the initial serving. The wonton soup was also solid, but had a bit more of a vinegar flavor than I'm used to. 

Service was quick and the prices were quite reasonable. If there was a place like this near me back home, it might get dangerous."}
{"text":"-The positives: attentive service, excellent dumplings, large and shareable portions for good price

-The negatives: little space between tables, cash only

-Overall: recommended for quick, casual meals for small groups"}
{"text":"A typical restaurant in Chinatown (i.e. substandard service), grungy looking especially the restrooms, decor stereotypical and a dragon lady owner to boot. This is a home style cooking establishment with questionable food handling practices and high probability of contracting e.coli. The dumplings are nothing awe inspiring, cathartic or earth shattering enough to keep me coming back for more.  For my personal health and peace of mind I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you like dumplings either fried or boiled you will love this place. It's very small inside and you may have to wait to get a table. We also got the house noodle which was really good and came with shrimp beef and chicken"}
{"text":"1. Fried dumplings were perfectly fried and the texture was perfect.
2. Steamed dumplings tasted a little bit too much wrapper.
3. Way too oily
4. There was a pool of oil on each plate
5. Seasoning was ok and nothing stood out
6. Did I mention that it was very oily?"}
{"text":"For two young women, we ordered 12 fried and 15 steamed dumplings. On a good day, we can finish them no problem. On other days (say, if i've had a bagel for breakfast haha), we had a harder time and maybe 2 or 3 had to be left or forced down.

Anyway, service is good for Chinatown, there is a bit of a delay for food but the poor women at the front have to make each dumpling by hand, to order, so it's understandable!

The steamed are probably boiled, but it doesn't bother me... i love their texture. the fried ones are pretty greasy but pretty damn delicious!! 
My favouite is the spinach and mushroom. I dont know why people think it's bland...? I love spinach so it tastes amazing to me :)"}
{"text":"Right in China Town this small dumpling house is extremely popular as there was a huge line up when I got there.  Price he is cheap you can get 15 dumplings (steamed. 12 for fried) for $6.99!! I prefer the fried dumplings to the steam ones.  They are not the best I had but it was def up there but the best value for sure."}
{"text":"This was just what I needed the other night. It was freezing, I was starving, and they were open later than almost everyone else with decent reviews. Cash only like most Chinatown places, but oh well. It's very reasonably priced and you can easily spend very little and eat a ton. 

I got an egg drop soup, thinking that it was $5 for a small, single-portion cup for myself. I ended up with a huge bowl that was definitely meant for 4+. It was slightly bland, but with a bit of soy sauce was really good. It just needs some fresh scallions and that's it! 

My buddy and I both got pan-fried dumplings; he got shrimp and pork, I got pork and chives. They were both pretty good (I've never seen dumplings fried or served like that). Very good late-night drunk food, but maybe not so great for your health--the grease was literally dripping from the dumplings and pooling onto the plate. Eeeek! 

Next time I get them steamed!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying out. Would recommend the hot and sour soup, the house special noodle and any of the pan fried dumplings (shrimp is a favourite). Wouldn't get the pancake appetizer, it wasn't that great. Not sure if they take debit as well, but they definitely don't take credit. Bringing cash would be the safest option."}
{"text":"The Dumpling house had amazing pot stickers and dumplings! You should definitely try these!"}
{"text":"Insanely good, dumplings are made fresh onsite!!! Cash only!! Lots of other options, not just dumplings, but you must get the dumplings when you're there. My fave is the pan fried versions. Sooooo good !"}
{"text":"This place does the best dumplings I've ever had in my life, the other stuff is spot on too. Not the cleanest place in the world but I don't mind that. I go every Friday because my daughter loves it too. I'd go every day if it didn't give me moobs.

Cash only, ATM just south at Dundas."}
{"text":"I happen to be moving into this hood and so I decided I needed to support the neighbours. I was always hesitant because The Dumpling house is one of the restaurants where \"rats\" have been spotted hanging out. I then realized that we live in a massive city with an underground and why the heck wouldn't there be rats and other critters living among us... So I put these reservations aside and try the veggie steamed and pan fried dumplings and hot and sour soup. 

Price:

Cheap and amazing. for under $14  you can get all of the above.

Taste

Delicious!

Definitely worth a check out!"}
{"text":"Yes this is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant.

That is the first thing that came to my mind when I stood in front of this place. Then when I walked a little closer I can see a few workers working away at making dumplings for the restaurant. I must admit, it's nice to watch them make all the dumplings. Most Asian restos do this to bring people in and it certainly caught my attention. Hmmmm.... Not wearing gloves so are their hands clean? Well they passed their last inspection so that's a good start. Looking in, the entire seating area is full. I guess their food is good here so we decided to go in.

So yeah, walking in it's still a hole-in-the-wall. On the right they prep and cook all the dumplings. Straight ahead down a small narrow walkway is the seating area. Crammed and packed - well it's the weekend right? We had to sit beside strangers because all the tables in the middle of the restaurant are side-by-side. Behind the seating area is the full kitchen area and another walkway towards the washroom. Do not use the washroom unless you absolutely have to!

Getting on with the food - It takes a while for the food to arrive on a busy day maybe at least 20 - 30 minutes if eating there on the weekend. When the food arrives it completely changes your impression about the place. 

We ordered:
House Special Noodle ($7.99) - Stir-fried noodle with all the proteins in brown sauce. What's the brown sauce? Don't ask, don't tell, but it was pretty good. Taste like it may have hoisin sauce in there.

Beef With Broccoli ($9.99) - Cooked very well, not swimming in the \"brown sauce\". Broccoli was crispy.

Pork & Chinese Cabbage Dumpling ($7.99) - 15 pieces for $7.99 is a really good deal. Add a little chili oil for extra flavouring and it just makes the dish right.

Fried Shrimp & Pork Dumpling ($8.59) - When it's pan fried in oil, it completely changes the taste of the dumpling. For 12 pieces it is still a great deal.

So it might look like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside looking-in and inside looking-in but the food is why everyone waits in line to eat here. Just so you know, if you're leaving a tip it will not go to the servers. It goes straight to the owner who operates the cashier. After all, it is cash payment only.

{"text":"Great dumplings and the best ones I have had in Toronto. Their pan fried dumplings are especially delectable with al dente skin which is also insanely crispy. They are however a bit greasy so I would not recommend you eat this every day."}
{"text":"Incredible dumplings. I LOVE the fried spinach mushroom but steamed shrimp and pork. Yum. Only disappointed because I've ordered hot and sour soup and garlic tofu and they were so greasy and goopy and not so good. Stick to the dumplings and you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Good dumpling place in the heart of Chinatown. Service was a little slow but the dumplings (chive and pork and shrimp) were nicely done. Also had the Chinese eggplant with beef, quite good."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment for me based on the high reviews it has gotten. This is the restaurant where you can see them making the dumplings at the window. The line was rather long as expected. Maybe it is because I'm Asian, but I did not find the dumplings to be that good. From what I saw, most people eating here were non-Asian. I personally would not return here, but for someone that wants to try dumplings for the first time, I don't see a problem."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)
I walked past Dumpling House many times.  I always wondered why there's always long lines, especially on weekend.  I doubted that it might be lines for take-out!?  

Dumpling House was on my bookmark for a long time.  It was my first to-go dumpling restaurant that I wanted to try. I've heard about how good their dumplings were on Yelp.  It should be one of the top-three dumpling restaurants in GTA that we should try. 

I actually don't have Chinese food often because I want to avoid food that is very oily or salty.  I do love salty taste but I think the way Chinese food is cooked contains much oil and salt.  However, I have cravings for Chinese food sometimes.  

We live close to here and always wander around downtown by foot.  Dumpling house is a good spot for trying something new because it's only 10-15 minutes walk from home.   

We ordered one order of half/half steamed dumpling and another order of half/half fried dumpling.  They were good but the stuff inside was very small if you compared to another restaurant like Yummy Yummy restaurant.  Their dumpling stuffing was of a generous amount and the owners were nice.

Everything was ok but nothing was standout for me except the freshness of the food.  It was good to see that their dumpling was made fresh.  So go for it if you don't wanna eat frozen dumpling! But be aware of cramped tables and trouble communicating with your server! 

P.S. The tip is already included in your bill without mentioning.  Yes, it is shown on the receipt, but if you don't understand Chinese or can't read Chinese, how could you tell!?  Check my receipt!  I saw that they added $2 for their tip after I gave them $3.  So they got 5 bucks from us ;) End of our story~"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and was looking forward to the dumplings which was the only thing that I liked here.  
We came for dinner, they separated my 7 person party into two tables even though we wanted to wait to be seated together.  The fried dumplings were good but everything else was meh.  I come from Manhattan Chinatown and Flushing Queens Chinatown so I know good Chinese food.  With the exception of the unique style of Fried dumplings everything else was average at best.

A few worthy notes.  I had a water cup with some green vegetation stuck to it, unfortunately I did not notice it until I felt it on my lips.  I informed a waitress she brought it back and brought me a new cup.  Upon inspection it looked like the same cup with the green vegetation scratched off.  She also acted like I was being unreasonable with the request.  You can probably guess I did not take another swig from the glass.

It is one of those classic 'get them in and out ASAP' and we were in and out in 15 minutes"}
{"text":"After seeing some of the pictures of food at this place, I could not wait to try it.  My wife and I finally made the road trip out to TO for the specific purposes of trying this place and it did not disappoint.  First off, I was struck by how small this place really was.  The kitchen and cash register are literally next to one another.  We were fortunate to beat the dinner rush on a Friday night, but still had to wait in lie for about 30 minutes.  We ordered the pan fried dumplings (the ones that look like they have webbing on top) and the boiled dumpling. Both were super fresh and very tasty.  I tried four other dumpling houses in Chinatown during my visit and this was the best overall.  If you go here, be ready to wait in line.  However, rest assured that the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"After reading through the reviews I decided to try their pork and chives, lamb, and shrimp and veg steamed dumplings. The lamb was my fav so I'll definitely be ordering those again. I also picked up the house noodles which come with chicken, beef and shrimp. I didn't think the noodles were that good and while they give you a large quantity there isn't much meat in it. The assorted dumplings were $8.50, and the noodles $7.99. The entire bill was less than $20 and the food was good enough for three people so not a bad deal. I think if you stick with only the dumplings you can't go wrong. This place is good for groups but is cash only!"}
{"text":"I have often passed by Dumpling House when walking through Chinatown and thought \"Hmm.. I bet those dumplings are really good\".

So on a cold winter day my boyfriend and I took a frosty walk down Spadina and warmed up with some hot dumplings and tea.

We got the three different types of fried as well as steamed dumplings. Although it was hard to tell which were which when they came to the table. The pork and fennel ones were delicious.

We also had the shanghai noodles with beef and they were ok. We asked the server what else we should try and she suggested these-- probably because we aren't chinese, but I wish we had ordered the family style salad that the table next to us had.

Overall, great dumplings and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"There are so many great restaurants in Toronto, (even Mother's Dumplings, we hear)... do you HAVE to come to this one, too? How will fanatical fans like us ever get a table again?! If word gets out about how amazing this place is we'll be waiting in such a loooong line. Though they are pretty good at getting people in and out of there, considering it's so small. And it is fantastic that the cool owner is always at the front door, guiding people's experience, talking recipes and sharing his passion. Ah, f* it. It's great. Go there as much as we do and together we'll keep the dumpling magic alive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today - food was good but the service was appalling - the tea was brought out and slid across the table with two cups but not poured, the waiter who took the order was disinterested and rude. We over ordered and asked for the left overs to be put into take away containers - the waitress returned with 4 polystyrene containers which she threw onto the table and walked off without a word. Service industry- ha ha!"}
{"text":"I would only recommend fried dumplings. Also ordered steam pork and chive and garlic pork. My thinking of good steam dumpling is fresh and juicy with thin skin. And it wasn't so much of that... Garlic pork came out totally different from what I ate in Taiwan since growing up (flooded with soy sauce, with over cooked pork. Maybe cooking style is varied places to places?"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best dumpling place in Toronto..lots to choose from but pork and chive is the best combo..

Had wonton soup too, light tasty and cheap

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Tour around Chinatown Toronto and stumbled upon this high rank restaurant for their dumplings. Very delish."}
{"text":"Great fried dumplings, look like crepes. Service is pretty bad,  but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"First let me start off and say that I love all types of chinese food. I will travel for good food. I live in NY and have gone to chinatown 1 to 2 times a month for for over 30 years, I have tried many restaurants. So you will understand I'm not just a bonehead writing a review. 
Now on to my review... This place was kinda dirty and there were some bugs around. 4 of us are seasoned foodies and we ordered Many different dumplings, we were very excited to try the different types. Almost all the dumplings were tasteless, some were gummy. The fried ones were just okay. The soup was just as bad. I never leave food over, more than half of the food was on the table when we left.  We were very disappointed. We went across the street and ate dumplings there.
 I can't believe these other great reviews, How can they say this place has great dumplings??? Save your money, go to Rol San down the block try their fried shrimp dumplings, they were some of the best I ever had, or just go across the street and try some of the small stores that just sell dumplings, they were very good and cheap as well."}
{"text":"I bought some pan fried dumplings to go and they're great! Their service was fast and pretty friendly! I recommend getting the pork and chives dumplings for snacking"}
{"text":"Highly recommend if you want delicious dumplings.. Fresh and very quick service. 

Cannot go wrong with any options it's what ever you prefer. Vegetarian, lamb, beef, shrimp and of course the preferred dumpling meat, pork. 

Have the option of fried or boiled. The wrapper has a nice taste and texture. The boiled option will have a bit more meat as the fried option it isn't really wrapped. More like a folded taco that's pinched at the top. 

Frying is my prefered option. Just amazing fried perfectly everytime."}
{"text":"Dumpling house is one of the remaining options left still standing in Chinatown, and one that I've been to over the years. Despite its name, they also offer a lot of other chinese dishes.

The restaurant isn't particularly clean. The condiments are sticky or oily, possibly from people using their hands to grab dumplings and then go and pour more soy sauce or vinegar. They do wipe off the bottles, but probably only when it needs to be refilled. The tables don't feel particularly clean either; I wouldn't put my stuff on there.

Dumplings are made fresh. You can see some if the staff at the very front of the restaurant putting dumplings together, sometimes walking back and forth with huge bowls of minced meat or vegetables.

You can get a plate of 15 boiled dumplings or 12 panfried dumplings for $8.99. The prices have steadily gone up everytime I come, and at this price I'd look at other options on the menu as their rice or noodle dishes are quite large in portion, and also cost about the same.

Dumplings take time to cook, so expect up to 10 minutes depending in how busy the restaurant is and what kind of dumpling you're getting.

The boiled dumplings taste great. They come with a good skin-to-filling ratio. The fried dumplings are not as big as I would like, but the flavor is there as well.

If the prices hit $10 a plate I won't be coming here for dumplings."}
{"text":"The sign in their window says \"Got Dumplings?\"  Dumpling House has steamed ones and pan fried ones with all different kinds of fillings.  And that's when I say, \"Thank God for the sampler plate.\"  This enabled us to try three different kinds of the steamed ones and three kinds of the pan fried.  My favorites were the steamed pork and cabbage and the pork and chive, which if combined, remind me of the soup dumplings that I love, minus the soup.  There was also a pork and fennel dumpling that I ordered out of curiosity, because I didn't know Chinese people ate fennel.  I am not a big fennel fan and that didn't change my mind.

 The fried ones were good, too.  I liked the way they were presented on the plate; served upside down with the brown bottoms all somehow melded together into one continuous surface until they were manually separated. 

I have definitely had fancier gourmet dumplings with thinner skins and more interesting fillings, but this is still a good place to have some old fashioned dumplings, the kind that remind me of the ones my grandmother would make at home.  Besides, there is a picture on the wall of Lang Lang with the owner, so this place has to be good, right?"}
{"text":"Food was good,but the boss was horrid. We recently took some out of town guests here for lunch. The boss went into an absolute rage and was yelling at all the staff in front of the customers. This went on and on until one customer demanded she stop yelling. She still continued for a while longer. We've never seen anyone berate and belittle their staff this badly. It was embarrassing . We will never go back. I hope those poor abused employees quit."}
{"text":"The pork and fennel dumplings, hot and sour soup and the general Tso chicken are out of this world!! 

You can also buy frozen dumplings which are great at home - especially on cold winter days when the line can be long."}
{"text":"So good. Never a lineup, lots of option, cheap to average prices, very quick service. Okay, it's not like it's a 5-star type sit-down place in the sense that it's not fancy and the service isn't mind-blowing but the food is great and quick and every single time I've been (several) it's been great. Definitely a comfort food place and I recommend it. Get dumplings - I prefer any of the meat ones fried. The fried noodles are great, too."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in Chinatown, hands down. Notable for being able to watch your dumplings being made in the window. Greasy as hell, but what else do you want when you're getting dumplings?! They also have a great menu besides dumplings, too - their soups in particular. The hot & sour is probably the best I've ever had. Their noodles are great too.

A lot of people remember this as a dive, but no longer - a recent update to their decor was very welcome. I've noticed a lot of people posting reviews criticizing the service ... I can understand, as they're unapologetic in how quick and impersonal they are. But given that there is almost always a line out of the door (especially at lunch & dinner), I appreciate being seated quickly, and getting my food equally fast. Never waited in line for more than 5 minutes, even when it's packed."}
{"text":"Not my ideal place for dumplings and not something I would rave about either. It's like going to a McDonald's; you know what you're getting but know that it won't be anything special.

I had the mixed pan fried dumplings and they are overly greasy. The fillings seem like they made no effort into making them. The table and seats feel greasy as are the soya sauce and spices that are on the table for your dumplings. The service is average and nothing more or less than a speedy Chinese restaurant. The one inconvenience is it's cash only.

It's not terrible and it filled me up... like McDonald's."}
{"text":"You have to get the pan-fried dumplings!! So delicious!! I don't live in Toronto but I'd go back just for these dumplings. Tried a few different things from the menu and enjoyed everything. Nice people running this place. Def one of my favorites now."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Dumpling House for over 5 years and until recently, we have always been pleased.  Three recent incidents there have caused us to go elsewhere.  1)  the two owners were in a shouting argument while disbelieving patrons watched.  2)  our dumpling order came with a lot of grit or sand in the filling, probably due to improperly washed chives/cabbage and, 3)  yesterday's dumpling order tasted very sour, as if the meat had started to go bad.  We reported it to our waitress, but we were still charged, even though she collected our plate full of dumplings and then presented the bill.  

We will try Mother's Dumplings or another restaurant in the future.  R Wilson"}
{"text":"Dumplings are good. Try both fried and steamed. Restaurant is dirty and bathrooms are absolutely gross."}
{"text":"Wanting to do a mini Chinatown tour during a short weekend vacation we started here on a Saturday night and it did not disappoint. As expected for a Saturday night there was a short wait, (less than 10 minutes), for two people. There wasn't very much room to stand while waiting for a table, but there was a clear view of the employees preparing the dumplings, which made up for it. We ordered the chive pancake, which was a little greasy but tasted good and 15 steamed dumplings, 2 types with pork filling and 1 with lamb- which was my favorite.  The wrapper was just the right thickness and texture. To make it a full meal for two people we would have had to order more, but as we were going to try a few other places it was just the right amount to start with."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and veg dumplings, the lamb dumplings, and the zha-jiang noodle. The \"steamed\" dumplings were actually boiled, not steamed, which makes the dough soggy (steamed dumpling dough should be firm, like al dente pasta). The dumpling fillings weren't too bad and personally found the lamb tastier than the shrimp one. But still, dumpling house, why so salty? Maybe because there are tons of other dumpling restaurants nearby and Markham that serve better dumplings.. Also, zha-jiang noodle is not usually served with coriander and julienned carrot."}
{"text":"Food was incredible but the service was not the best. We had a large group with a complex order so I guess you would expect a little frustration.  The fried dumplings was unbelievable, try them. The steam dumplings as well are good. The dishes where all good and vegetables.  Remember to bring cash. Cash only place."}
{"text":"I'd order the steamed dumplings here again. But not the fried ones. The fried ones are way too oily, and feel like they have less filling. 

The dumpling wrapper is a bit thick, but they have pretty unique fillings here. My faves so far are:
Pork and fennel (it actually tastes like dill to me)
Pork and shrimp (they put whole shrimps in)
Lamb (very lamby)

Chive, egg and shrimp one is good too. Spinach and mushroom is pretty regular."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite spots to go when I am in Toronto . Recently when I came In i. Prices they have updated the menus and they looks great! We got a few orders of the steamed and fried dumplings all variety's. I love that you can choose up to three. I brought some friends  with me this time and they fell in love with Dumpling house. One tip to always remember cash only! Yum yum"}
{"text":"It was an awful experience, the dumplings had a hair and the \"Boss\" was blaming on us, screaming bad words and throwing plates and food everywhere. When we try to speak to her she went completely MAD and start yelling and cursing, she even apologize. I'm definitely not going back to that restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in on a chilly fall day for some dumplings to warm our tummy. Came with 2 other individuals on a Thursday lunch and was quite impress with the food quality and service. Before going, make sure you do not expect anything fancy.. its a typical chinatown restaurant with only 15 - 20 tables in the room. For lunch, they were quite busy with every table being filled and even having a line waiting for a table. We were lucky and seated right away.

Menu is not overly huge but has your variety in dumplings (pan fried or steamed). For pan fried dumplings, you get 12 and for steamed you get 15. We opted for the pan fried option (3 way) so we got to pick 3 different flavours for the price of 8.99. We choose lamb dumpling, shrimp and veg, and pork and chive. They pan fried the bottom of the dumpling to crispiness and the top part of the dumpling soft. Fillings are not OVERLY filled but a decent amount for that price. We also shared the green onion pancake (4.99)... and I definitely have had better before. This one was a little too thin for my liking and did not have enough green onions in the filling. But it was pipping hot when it got to our table so that was delicious!

We each decided to try their noodles, one got the pickled pork noodle, another got the ja jeun mein, and I got the beef noodle. It is a standard noodle soup but the broth was quite flavourful. You also get a good amount of beef pieces in it as well... comes with 1 big shanghai bok choy sliced three ways. Was definitely filling and good for the price of 7.99. My friends with the pickled pork noodle said it was ok and decently flavourful with oodles amount of noodles and pork and mustard. My other friend who had the ja jeun mein said it was te best he has ever had (but he has some low standards sometimes....) didn't get a chance to try either but would definitely return again for those pipping hot dumplings!

Sauces option were limited (vinegar, soya sauce and chilling sauce) nothing overly fancy but good to dip your dumplings in after.

But be aware that it is only cash only!!!"}
{"text":"I always bring friends here. Tasty food and cheap prices."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.
The menu is easy for a Westerner/Vegetarian to enjoy dumplings at. They come in orders of 12 for pan fried and 15 for \"steamed.\" I was sad that my \"steamed dumplings were in fact boiled, though they were still tasty. I especially enjoyed the egg, chive, veg. \"steamed\" dumpling. 

My friends Singapore noodles looked really tasty as I love curry style noodles. 

They did not take credit card."}
{"text":"Our new favourite in Riverdale. Excellent dumplings made right in front of you. Delicious. Family friendly."}
{"text":"After the Koffee Krawl UYE, we all huddled over to the Dumpling House Restaurant.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table, which was not bad, considering we were a group of 11-12.

For $5 a head, we had happy tummies without feeling like we overate.  Jennifer K. took charge of the ordering.  We got to taste a variety of dumplings: pork, beef, shrimp to name a few in addition to a pan-fried onion cake.

The pan-fried onion cake was too greasy for my liking.  The moment I bit into it I could taste nothing but oil.  Albeit that it was very flavourful, but extremely extremely greasy.  To iterate, when we were passing around the onion pancake, it almost slid off the plate because it was that \"slick.\"

The steamed dumplings were very \"wet\" to the point where even skilled chopstick users had trouble picking them up.  Judging from its presentation, and being sans bamboo basket, I would most probably conclude that they boil as opposed to steam their dumplings - which is probably why they are so hard to pick up with chopsticks.  

The pan-fried dumplings were quite tasty, although I deduct points for only frying one side.  Laziness is a peeve of mine.  A pan-fried dumpling should be fried all around, not just on the crusty side that is presented. 

I would probably walk a bit further down the street to Mother's Dumplings for my dumpling fix."}
{"text":"PAN FRIED DUMPLING.

We ordered both - all three of us preferred the pan fried dumpling.  Love the spider web connecting them all.  And they have a few sipping sauce.  I've not had the red one and that was so good...

The cucumber garlic and spicy seaweed salad are both great since they didn't have ac on.  Why I have to clue."}
{"text":"Dumpling was good and price reasonable but would not recommend to any friends.  They cheat. Meaning, asked about exchange rate to US$ and agreed it was $1.21 to CN$1. But when we paid with $40, they gave us equal amount back.  Not honoring exchange rate. Basically cheated me out of US$5.  

Vendors should not cheat tourist as this is a major tourist attraction."}
{"text":"Lots of food, interesting decor, pan fried dumplings especially good"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had come here once for dinner, we really like their beef pan fried dumplings and spicy beef noodle that we have ordered, both are really tasty and worth coming back for. Although the two food are very delicious I am very disappointed with the dish my boyfriend have got,the \"gong pao chicken over rice\", the chicken just taste nasty and bad quality, it taste so bad we literally couldn't took a third bite out of it, on top of that the service is bad too, the waitress come by only to tell me they only accept cash payment and not even bother to ask if everything is okay or how we like the food. That's just plainly disappointing, three star for the wonderful pan fried dumplings and beef noodle."}
{"text":"I used to come here often with my father a few years back, now I brought my boyfriend to try this place out. I usually just order the pan fried dumplings (shrimp) but we also decided to order the bean curd noodles. The dumplings were delicious as usual, crispy bottom with a flavourful filling. The noodles on the other hand needed more seasoning. They were mixed with jalape√±os and a sauce but not much was going on flavour-wise. 

It was quite busy at the restaurant, however service was relatively fast. 

I definitely recommend this place to others and I will continue to eat here when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Best pan fried dumpling I have ever had. Period. If you are looking to be swept off your feet, you definitely need to try the fried dumplings here. They are outstanding!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their Fried Pork & Chive Dumplings.

The skin is so delicate and has a nice chew. The filling is juicy and packed with flavor. I love the light crunch on the bottom of each dumpling. They are seasoned perfectly and not overly oily. These dumplings are so light and easy to eat.

We really enjoyed the Spicy Seaweed, Hot & Sour Soup and Steamed Pork & Chinese Cabbage Dumplings. We appreciate the generous serving sizes and reasonable prices. The dishes we ordered were very flavorful. We were also happy that the Hot & Sour Soup wasn't packed with corn starch. The broth was light, aromatic and had a depth of flavor. The skin in the Steamed Pork Dumpling dish was light and smooth. Very easy to eat. 

Service needs great improvement. Once we were seated it took quite awhile for our server to take our order and bring out tea. When the server brought over our dishes, everything came out at the same time except for the Fried Pork & Chive Dumplings. When we reminded our server about that dish, it arrived to our table once we were finished with the rest of our meal. We believe they forgot to write that dish down. The employees told us the Fried Dumplings take longer to prepare but the table next to us received their Fried Dumplings before any of their other dishes came out. Restrooms are available downstairs. Seating is tight.

Though service needs much improvement, the food has won me over."}
{"text":"This is a really great spot! The restaurant is organized in three long rows of tables, many of them communal so that as many people as possible can be packed in. When you walk in you walk right past the kitchen where they are doing some sort of magic. 

They have a huge menu and a ton of vegetarian options, ranging from the spicy bean curd noodles, which were delicious, to a quite a few dumpling options filled with vegetables. 

The dumplings come either steamed or fried. I'm personally quite partial to the fried dumplings, but both are delicious. 

The fried ones are made in one pan that is flipped over right onto your plate, so all of your dumplings are kind of stuck together and you break them off as you eat them. (Attaching a photo in case I've done a horrid job of describing this.) What I'm trying to say is that they're wonderful! 

We ordered far too much food and even the leftovers the next day were great. I plan on going back and gorging myself on vegetarian dumplings, probably more than once in my lifetime. :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

This is my go to place for dumplings whenever I'm in the Chinatown area. Dumplings are freshly made, and cheap. Whenever I come here, I always get am order of boiled and fried  dumplings - but beware, fried dumplings are super oily so sometimes I like to take a napkin and dab the excess oil off lol. 

Today, we ordered boiled dumplings (pork and chive), hot and sour soup - perfect for a cold day like today, and finally a bowl of pickled cabbage pork noodle soup. I seriously need to remind myself that I should never order because I always end up ordering more than I can eat. Anyway, all the food came out pretty quickly, the hot and sour soup was great had a nice kick to it, noodles were tasty as well, finally the boiled dumplings was okay but I found that the dumpling skin was a bit too thick for my liking. 

Overall, cheap place and you know you should visit when you see other Chinese people eat here. Another thing is - don't forget to take your cellphone with you lol. The owner reminded me to take my cellphone when I was putting on my coat. He told us that he once collected seven cellphones on the table because people tend to forget them, and they didn't even come back to get it lol."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here. Plentiful and pretty decent prices. We got both steamed dumplings (classic pork and chive) and the fried dumplings (shrimp and vegetables). We also got the Shanghai style noodles with vegetables and beef.
Flavours were really delicious and everything was cooked perfectly. Fresh tasting, the dough is just right and generous filling. 
Staff were great, food comes out fairly quickly.
Consider the following before coming here:
Cash only
Limited seating... Very tight squeeze especially on busy days, which it's usually busy.
If you want bang for your buck, this is a great place for that. The food is really good which is why I still give it 5 stars despite the small space and cash only.
I have had homemade dumplings a number of times and this place comes pretty close to that."}
{"text":"I really, really love this place. I've been eating here since I was a kid and it's barely changed. The food is comforting and delicious.. if a little greasy. Best for the dumplings and hot and sour soup.. other things on the menu are much, much better ordered from other places nearby.

Here's a breakdown of my thoughts and experiences:

Dumplings: Heck yea! The lamb dumplings are really fantastic and so are the pork and fennel and pork and chive. I can also vouch for the mixed vegetable and spinach and mushroom ones as yummy vegetarian options! 

Boiled or fried.. is a really matter of preference I think. The dumpling filling is pretty flavourful and I love the vinegar, chilli and soy dipping combo offered.. so I actually often prefer the dumplings boiled because I like the soft and chewy texture and larger order (15 as opposed to 12 when you order fried). Having 'em fried is a nice treat, however, because of the beautiful battered presentation and deep-fried texture. Very heavy feeling after eating them though..

The hot and sour soup is seriously incredible.. nicely thick, actually spicy, and spiked with fresh cilantro. The order is HUGE. Good to split between 4 for a nice sized bowl each. 

Other stuff on the menu.. noodles, salads, pancakes.. is lacklustre. The noodles are super greasy and very mildly flavoured. The beef and chicken in the noodle and nice dishes is poor quality, gnarly stuff. The marinated tofu tastes like generic 5spice tofu that you buy in Chinese supermarkets. The seaweed salad is very under-seasoned and tough. I avoid most things now, but try other stuff from the menu from time to time just to see if anything's changed. It hasn't. You get big, hot heaping plates with the rice/noodle dishes but its so bland you'll tire of it quickly.

but GREAT FOR DUMPLINGS!!!

There's a big of a hustle at busy times but I like the busy atmosphere. 

As a warning: this place is cash only (good for them!) so plan accordingly or else you can run to one of the nearby banks at Dundas and Spadina."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum. Dumplings steamed, dumplings fried, many kinds, you can't go wrong. Bustling, short wait times, inexpensive.

NB: cash only. Americans: make sure you have Canadian cash. Assuming you can pay with US currency seems to be a pet peeve of the proprietor (he chatted us up about this).

Protip: half-cooked potato threads appetizer is amazing, so is the cucumber salad. Get these for a fresh bite before and to offset the dumplings. The green onion cake is pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fantastic dining experience. The host was very fun and chatted with us while we waited for our table. We ordered and got our food in a very timely manner and even managed to get some more to go. The atmosphere is very cosy however, the food is very tasty and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Dumpling is really good. I only tried the chives and pork. It was juicy and tasty. I also ordered 4 side dishes, and they were all somewhat disappointing. They were in huge portions though. Like a regular dish size. 

I would say just go for the dumplings here."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic.
Didn't tell us it was CASH ONLY until we were done. Only had US dollars on us and would only exchange at 1:1. Paid more in this \"exchange rate\" than our entire meal. We got hosed. Not cool."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a dumpling sampling on a weekend trip in the city.

Group of asian woman were standing in the front window making dumplings for all to see.

Tried the minced beef and pork/chinese cabbage dumplings.  AWESOME.

Walked out there (after 30 dumplings for 2 people), paid about $25 with sodas to drink.  Quite cheap in my opinion.

One of the owners came over and even chatted with us for a while.  Super friendly place.

Definitely returning.;"}
{"text":"After a dark, rainy drive back into town from Mississauga, we were looking for some food that would be easy to share in our hotel room. I remembered my sister, who is a Toronto resident, describing dumplings from this place one night on the phone so we turned on to Spadina after making a phone-in order.

The dish that my sister had so memorably described were pan-fried dumplings (made in-house) that were presented webbed together in a \"net\" of sauce...intriguing!

We ordered three varieties of pan-fried dumplings: spinach & mushroom, shrimp and pork/chives. We also ordered a house special fried noodles. This was for three adults and two small children.

The pan-fried webbing of sauce is something that I have not seen before and it was delicious! My favourite were the pork & chives and they disappeared quickly. The kids just loved the dumplings.

We didn't have a menu to order from so we took the recommendations of the person who answered the phone. I would have preferred one variety of dumpling in steamed form just because I don't like eating so much fried food. The noodles had a distinct sweet taste but I found them a little too greasy.

On future visits to Toronto, I'd love to dine in at this modest little place and try the pan-fried dumplings freshly plated. I can imagine that I'd stop by often if I lived in Toronto for a comforting meal."}
{"text":"Nothing crazy. Not really tasty. 
You can find a lot better.
Otherwise staff is nice and service is quick."}
{"text":"Service was relatively quick. It was packed but we were seated within 10-15 min. 

The dumplings were delicious in particular the steamed lamb and the pork with chives. We were a party of four and 3 ordered soup. It was very good but it would have been nice to know that the soup was a full meal on its own. I'd recommend one soup per 3/4 people. 

I would highly recommend it highly for a quick, cheap and tasty meal."}
{"text":"only eat there 2 times, 1st time got plastic in my noodle, 2nd time got steel thread . the service is shit,  food srsly plain, nothing wow at all. but just dirty. very dirty. esp. the washroom, i can't imagine what ppl r eating sitting in that crowd loud pig pit."}
{"text":"It delivers on its name? lol

If you're craving freshly made dumplings, this is your standard Chinese dumpling restaurant. It's a tiny space in Chinatown, which looks a bit more run down nowadays, but this place hasn't changed a bit. It still has the bright red tables. 

Well .. some things have changed. The prices are higher now, ~$10 for 15 steamed dumplings or for 12 pan fried dumplings. There's a variety of meats/vegetables to choose from.

They speak (broken) English, since they're a lot of locals and tourists. Service was meh. It's quite busy, they're in a rush to get you in and out."}
{"text":"The restaurant owner is a really big jerk. I only ate here once but I won't come here again. You can find similar sentiments on the owner and reasons on why if you sort by lowest rating.

First of all, the food is okay (It's hard to mess up dumplings, it's just filling plus dough) and explains all the positive reviews. You can see a couple of Chinese ladies in white aprons folding and stuffing the dumplings from the front window when you pass by the restaurant. The restaurant is well-cleaned and modern. I say all this at the beginning to not take away from the chefs and the people that work there. 

However, the owner is a big jerk that only cares about money. The day I visited this restaurant, while I was eating the owner started yelling loudly at a girl that worked there and she ended up crying and going to the washroom. I didn't know what it was about but no one deserves that type of treatment, especially in front of customers. Then he started ranting to me very aggressively about how in order to make money, you have to work hard. He said that if a worker gets upset, they should go to the washroom, wipe their face, and get back out here and keep working. I think it is because I'm a young person and he thought he was teaching me a life lesson. Mind you, this was all in loud Chinese and worse than how I am describing.

This experience left me with a bad memory and impression. In fact, I feel uncomfortable every time I pass the restaurant and see the owner through the windows. He tends to stand there right in the front ominously. I did try to come back one time because I was hungry for dumplings. I was actually turned away because they didn't accept credit and I didn't have any cash.

One star because it's the lowest rating and one star for the food. Go eat there if you want if you don't mind the owner but I personally won't, even if the food is good."}
{"text":"Sorry! we have been going here for years, but all of a sudden my wife and I felt a change in the atmosphere and the owner seemed less happy with his customers. The food is generally good but the feeling makes the place for us and it's just not the same. We will be looking for a more friendly dumpling house."}
{"text":"What a gem.  Small, hard to find, hole-in-the-wall joint with really inexpensive food with large portions.  Note that this place is cash-only.

In with a group and ordered several items.  Nothing we ordered was less than outstanding.  As the house namesake suggests - the dumplings are the real draw.  That said, best thing I had on the menu was the hot and sour soup.  Ordered it really as an afterthought - just an appetizer to the main course.  But ended up plowing down four cups (1 bowl) of it and refused to share with my dining partners. I was willing to start a fight over it if came to it.   Really that good.  Simple dish - but wow."}
{"text":"My second visit in a couple of years. The food was okay, but the scampering roach was not. Even worse was the server standing a few yards away from my table, at the service station, clipping her nails with great care. Disgusting. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings
Amazingly quick service, especially on take out orders
Very well priced

Both friend and steamed dumplings are delicious, and they have a pretty good selection of options

Have more standard 'dishes' as well like General Tso chicken etc. 

Grey spot for a cheap, quick, and easy meal. 

Cash only

Also, fun to watch the dumplings being made in the storefront window"}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop place that may not be the cleanest nor the most friendly but who cares about that when you're eating such great food?

Stopped in here famished after an afternoon in the city.  I didn't look around to see how big the portions were so when our food was placed in front of us I was a little overwhelmed (just kidding, I was delighted). 

We ordered the egg drop soup, shrimp and veggie dumplings, and veggie fried rice.

Egg drop soup: delicious.  I was pleased that they had chili on the table because I like a kick to my soup.  There were large pieces of veggies in the soup, like cabbage, but not your run of the mill green cabbage.  It was purple cabbage and it was peppery and delicious!

Shrimp and veggie dumplings: a huge plate of handmade deliciousness.  There are ladies making these in the front of the restaurant so you can watch your meal be assembled.  All of the ingredients used in the dumplings were flavorful and fresh. I snarfed my portion so fast I didn't even take a picture. 

Veggie fried rice: I appreciated their use of different veggies in their rice, ie mushrooms! Generous amounts of vegetables and a good amount of seasoning.  I didn't need to add any soy sauce or chili.  

I really did enjoy the food here, when can I return? This place is dinged due to service and the general grime of the shop.  The bathrooms are not wheelchair accessible and the women's stall doesn't even lock. I'll remember that for next time! 

Cash only!"}
{"text":"This dumpling joint shares territory with 1088 other food establishments on the block but it is instantly recognizable due to it's giant red sign and the 2-3 shawtys that stand by the window making dumplings all day, errrrrday.

It was packed on a Saturday evening with a line outside the door shortly after 5pm. 
Ordered the famous pan fried dumplings and Zhejiang noodles. I've been told that the pan fried dumplings is their signature item on the menu and boy did it not disappoint. Almost every table had ordered dumplings. Noodles were a recommendation and there was SO much sodium I almost drank a liter of water by the time I finished my meal. 

Will definitely return for dumplings. FYI, the place is a bit cramped when there's a full house. But it's cool to watch the staff cook at the front of the restaurant. Gives a very Asian food stall vibe. Ya know what I'm saying?"}
{"text":"We got an order of boiled dumpling and the crispy one. 
We also ordered Di SAN Xian, Chinese Saut√©ed Potato Eggplant and Bell Pepper. It looks oily. But it tasted good. The place is very popular. So better to come in early for lunch. By the time around 12:30 that day we dined in, there were at least 6 people in line waiting to be seated.
And please bring cash!! They only accept cash!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed by this resto. There are so many great places in Chinatown. This is not one of them. The dumplings are ok but not great. None of the dishes were home runs."}
{"text":"Just to make things clear, I give this place a 4.75. Went here for the first time the other day. Ordered a plate of pan fried dumplings,  a rice dish, and a green onion pancake to split with my boyfriend....needless to say it was more than enough food, we had leftovers good for a whole other meal! 

They offer the option of splitting your dumpling flavours. For about 8 bucks, we got 4 each of spinach and mushroom, shrimp,  and chicken dumplings....none of them were a disappointment. The people next to us were nice enough to offer us one of their steamed dumplings so we could try the difference between steamed. The steamed were even better! Next time I go back, definitely getting steamed ones :)

The rice dish we got was soo so good. Massive quantity,  and had everything in it (chicken, egg, beef, shrimp, veggies)  for only 7 dollars! Well worth it.

We tried tye green onion pancake because everyone seemed to be making a big deal about it in previous reviews I read. It wasn't horrible,  buuuut wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be :/ For $4, I wouldn't get it again.

There is a small, cozy seating area and the place is overall quite cute. At the storefront window, you can see the workers making the dumplings right there! 

With tip, ended up spending $30 and it was enough for my boyfriend and I to eat twice. Great quality,  just a little disappointed by the pancake. Would definitely come back though!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dumplings and a wide variety available. The space is small but cute.  You can see the staff making the dumplings in the window as you walk by the restaurant. We had the lamb dumplings, chicken dumplings, house noodles and hot tea. All of the food was delicious, fresh, and plentiful. The only downside is they don't take credit cards so you have to have cash. Overall it was worth the hunt for cash to cover the bill. Hope to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Superb dumplings. We must have tried 6 different kinds, steamed and pan fried- all were excellent. The skin is not so thick so it's not at all like you're just eating wrapper. The only surprising downside to this place was they did not serve tea! What dumpling house doesn't serve tea?!"}
{"text":"OMG~~~  this is the best dumpling restaurant in Toronto period!  No need to look further folks, if you love dumplings, this is where you need to be!

Two main types of dumpling dishes, boiled and pan-fried.  Wow, as I'm writing this review, my mouth is salivating just thinking about it.

It gets quite busy during lunch hours, so get there fast if you can to avoid line-ups.

The restaurant has an open dumpling station at the front so you can witness how these magical dishes come to LIFE!!  Yaarggh~~

Dumplings come with different fillings; our favourite ones so far are the pork / sour cabbage for the boiled and pork / shrimp for the pan-fried...  Mmmmm, so delicious...

Our other favourite dishes are the Shanghai Fried Noodles and the Pork Belly Done in 3 Ways.  Huh?  Well let me break it down for ya.  This dish features the beloved pork belly as broiled, fried and grilled.   Wow right?  Just watch out for the hot peppers in the dish, it is very very spicy. (I learned the hard way)

Service is always quick, servers are attentive and the owner is always by the counter with a smile.  The price range is just PHENOMENAL!!! What can you get for 6 dollars these days? Well you can get a delicious dumpling dish that comes with 15 succulent dumplings!  Other dishes are moderately priced as well, ranging from $6 ~ $8

All together a great experience! If you LOVE dumplings, you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant rightly has more rating than mothers dumplings down the street. 

So here it goes, we got 3 kind of steamed dumplings pork and chive, pork and Chinese cabbage and minced chicken. 

The fried choices were lamb, pork and shrimp and beef. The texture was just something I can't explain, it gooey and chewy buy the filling made it all. 

The fried dumplings were a tad bit oily but hey come on, they are fried. Lol it was juice flavorful amazingly gorgeous and tasty. 

We also got house noodles, house fried rice and wonton soup. For me the show stealer was the soup. It had the most amazing chicken flavor I've had until now. With veggies and cilantro. 

The noodles were cooked perfectly in a black sauce, with lots of chicken shrimp egg etc etc. Although the place is a lot smaller than mothers dumplings but the flavor and taste is better than mothers dumplings. 

My wife isn't a big lover of dumplings but she enjoyed it. Even my 4 year old son said it's amazing food. 

A must visit if you love dumplings."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends visiting from New York because one of them was told by their NYC colleagues that she must have dumplings in Chinatown. Honestly, I have not explored as much of Chinatown as I should have because I live in Markham, but when I did my research, Dumpling House came up on top!

Located on Spadina just north of Dundas, Dumpling House is a small restaurant, but with speedy service, even if there was a queue for tables, I reckon turnovers would be quite quick. My friends and I came here for dinner after a late lunch. The five of us ordered steamed dumpling, fried dumplings, fried onion pancakes, shrimp fried rice and shanghai noodles. 

My friends thought the food were really good, but I thought it was just okay. The \"steamed\" dumpling looks boiled. The fried dumpling was drenched in oil. However, the other dishes were pretty decent, but considering it's called Dumpling House, their dumplings should be perfect, alas it is not, but it's not bad.

While service was speedy, we also felt as if we were being rushed out because when we finished our food, we were immediately given the bill. What if we had wanted to order more food?

If you're looking for super authentic dumplings, I don't think this is it, but if you're looking for quick and fairly cheap food, then by all means, go to Dumpling House."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!

Definitely worth the hype. Like that you can do a combo to try different dumplings, but pork and leek is the best. I also preferred the boiled dumplings over the pan fried."}
{"text":"When you go to a restaurant that is called \"Dumpling House\" and you don't order a dumpling - I think you are making a mistake. The best dumpling in Toronto, properly made with the crispy bits, can't seem to get it any where else this way. We tried 3 options of the fried dumplings (pork, Chicken and Shrimp) all excellent. We have not tried anything else on their menu and likely never will. 
Remember - don't be a snob and expect a nice decor or a wonderful attentive service because you probably will not get it. It is all about the dumplings. Eat and please leave because I am waiting for your table. What a business!!!"}
{"text":"i love the food here - despite the apathetic service - good price - great pan fried dumplings - and i love the house special noodles - perfect amount of grease!!! delish!!"}
{"text":"Came here, again based solely on Yelp. First time we came, we got the variety of steamed dumplings; all fresh made right there in front of you. The restaurant is small,  but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. The dumplings were fresh and absolutely delicious; so much so we came back the next day and tried the fried ones!!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES

I say YES to Dumpling House.

This as Chinese and as Dumpling as it gets, authentic stuff. 

Huge selection and something for all, but we kept it 100 and got the Pork and Chives fried dumplings and Pork and Chinese cabbage steamed dumplings.

Left very happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"It was just okay. We were starving when we went and were impressed by the overflow there so thought it would be well worth the wait. The dumplings were somewhat tasteless. We ordered 3 different tastes (veggie, shrimp and pork) and when the waitress brought them she couldn't identify which was which, and open eating them neither could we. Also got the beef noodle soup which was decent. Many chunks of inedible beef though ().

The service was speedy and the people in the other patrons seemed happy. I would maybe go back to give it a second try, especially since others seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Food was really tasty but portions were at least double the size they needed to be. Pork chive dumplings were excellent. I had the Shanghai noodles, my husband had the pork fried rice. We could have easily split one entr√©e and been sufficiently full, so we ended up wasting a lot of good food as we didn't want to carry it around with us through the rest of the day. It is definitely cramped inside. They fit in as many tables as possible in the space they have."}
{"text":"This dumpling house is so good! I've tried their steamed and fried pan ones (both amazing). The interior of the place is super rich in Chinese culture with masks on the walls and red tables. The servants here are very friendly and nice. The things are not expensive at all, you can totally order more items on the menu without breaking your bank :). Overall, I would recommend coming with friends so you can order more to share. However, they only accept cash payments so just be careful."}
{"text":"Was hoping for good dumplings based on reviews, but we didn't have the same experience. The steamed dumplings we had were just ok, the dumpling skin was thick. What bothered me the most though, was the grease stains on our chopsticks and the thin film of oil in our water, seriously?... thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Having grown up making and eating dumplings in an area of China known for its dumplings and buns, I have to say that this place was very good. Their dumplings were made to order quickly, and the price was reasonable. I really enjoyed being able to watch the workers make the dumplings in the front of the resturaunt, and then watch the dumplings being cooked in the open kitchen. 

My only complaint is that the dumpling wrapper was heavier and clunkier than I would have liked."}
{"text":"The food was so-so. I ordered the zha-jiang noodles and it was extremely salty. I told them to not out cilantro in my food and they still did. Well so far it was all acceptable. However, I witnessed the restaurant owner, a dude in his 50s or 60s, yelling at an old lady who was a customer, and kicked her out. Apparently the owner messed up her order, but instead of apologizing, the owner humiliated her in front of 40 other customers. Of the 1 hour we spent there, the owner was constantly berating his employees in public. When we were going to pay, we asked if credit card is okay. The owner replied rudely that only cash is accepted. Everyone should stop going to this restaurant as the owner is the lowest kind of human being, in other words, a scumbag. Nothing special about the food neither, pretty average."}
{"text":"The General's Chicken was sub-par. Big chunks of not-so-quality chicken with giant slices of very spicy veggies (onions and peppers). Spice is ok, but it didn't add anything to the flavor or consistency. Unlike any General's chicken I've had before, and not in a good way. 

Very good service."}
{"text":"Cheap. Delicious. Unique.
Like many restaurants in Chinatown, the storefront isn't the most appealing, and from the size of it, you'd likely miss this Kensington gem. 

If you're coming here, you have to try the Shanghai noodles and dumplings!"}
{"text":"I will never forget this meal. It was simply amazing. I went with my mom for my 18th birthday and we stumbled upon this place, but not before checking on yelp (haha). We sat down and ordered the steamed dumplings which were soooooo good. And then we saw this couple sitting in the table in front of us and asked what they were eating bc it smelled so good. They said it's the best dish here so we ordered it too. Family tofu dish (I'm pretty sure), on the backside of the menu. Honestly just try it. You will be surprised. It's so amazing and we will definitely be back with the whole family. I'd go there alone just to eat haha!"}
{"text":"Quick simple and delicious. 
Food is fast and cheap! 
Small interior but people don't stay long. This isn't the kind of place to sit and enjoy, or relax with friends. 
It's the kind of place to come in and eat some well made dumplings and move on! 
Pork and chive pan fried is a classic. I would also recommend the steamed version, although they can be a little doughy. 
The wonton soup is also a must!"}
{"text":"i found this restaurant through yelp when I was looking for authentic delicious dumplings.
The restaurant is small, family-run and un-assuming so the decor is nothing to rave about but the food...
The food was great. very authentic and fresh. The whole family loved it."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted with this restaurant. Food is good, service is good, but there's something else....

The food is fantastic, reminds me of home-made dumplings when mom used to make them. I've always enjoyed everything I've ordered here. 4 stars for food.

However... the environment makes me drop a few stars. And no I'm not talking about decor or customer service. Decor's cute and we always get seated and fed in very reasonable amount of time - also very attentive services. I'm talking about how the owner treats the worker. More than once I've heard him yelling at other workers (swearing, and threatening almost) in Chinese (yes i can clearly hear when he yells it across the dining hall).  Maybe they're joking or afterwards makeup after the yelling - but as a diner, who just wants peaceful good food, I get a earful of profanity, angry tones and that's just not pleasant. my husband and I have actually expressed this to the owner and he has many reasons why he's being that way - don't think he sees this is hurting his business. I thought it was one incident, but after visiting this place and repeatedly hearing the arguing - it's like a norm there. It makes me sad, to think good attentive places are run like this.  I see other yelpers express the same concerns before. I hope the owner can do better - in the meantime, I'm going to search for another dumpling spot."}
{"text":"Oh these little dumplings! Thanks to Arvid who pointed me here. These are authentic. Don't be fazed by the stern Chinese women in the window expertly rolling and cupping these little gems into the fried pockets of deliciousness that they eventually become. Do walk in and wait for a table, squashed up against a cheery Indian family on Christmas Eve. Don't order more than one order of dumplings per person unless you're starving. Do marvel at the golden crust of 12 pork and chive dumplings filled with just a whiff of savory broth that are thrown onto your table without even a smile. Do wish you lived in Toronto and could frequent this joint almost everyday."}
{"text":"Its a small spot which always get busy during lunch hours - due to acceptable taste & affordable prices. I have been there several times, and tried different things.
Their Dumplings tastes good. Their noodles are above average as well. I also tried a typical chinese fast food dish (general tao I guess), was also good."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto last month and stopped in here and some lovely dumplings.  I found this place listed in the lonely planet guide and they were right on the money.  

There were two woman making dumplings in the front window.  Always a good sign in my book.  The staff was friendly and we quickly ordered a few different dumplings.  The fried ones came with an amazing lattice of crispy goodness connecting the savory little guys.  So yummy, such great textures.  The ratio of veggies to pork in the dumplings was spot on.  The spinach dumplings, while interesting, were not my favorite.  

The place is dirt cheap and I would probably go there every week if I lived in Toronto.  A great treat, give it a try!"}
{"text":"My favourite kind of house music is \"Dumpling House.\" It's like, normal house music, but it sounds like you're trapped in a hot dumpling covered in shiny dumpling goo. It's quite sexy and liberating. Very big in Japan but then isn't everything. I'm also quite big in Japan, comparatively speaking, which is why I like going there. But this review is about China. Well, Toronto. But amazing Chinese food in Toronto. So let's get on with it.

What to get: Pan Fried Pork And Chive Dumplings
Why: Because like the Bee Gees, you'll love Chive Talking

\"Dumplings\" is not just a nickname for people who have just been dumped. Nope. It's also one of the most famous and delicious culinary exports of China. Having a dumpling in your palm is like having China in your hand. And then like that other thing you often hold in your palm, you squeeze it and it shoots goo all over your wrist, and there's a million dead dumplings all over you. Tragic. But anyway.

Dumpling House restaurant. I've been here 3 times now. The first two occasions, they were probably the best fried soup dumplings I've ever tasted, and definitely done very differently to anywhere else I've tried them. This most recent time, they were very good, but not \"the best ever\", which I think might reflect how many good dumplings I've now tried all over the place. And yet I really can't think of a place where I like the dumplings better, or as much, as these fried piping-hot pockets of juicy greasy goodness, and so I will say - for now - that Dumpling House has the best dumplings I've ever had, to date. And better than the \"best places in NYC\", all of which I've tried.

One rival to the throne is nearby - around the corner at the much-less-busy Yummy Yummy Dumplings, they make some really good ones too. Try both!

The experience is worth the incredibly cheap price of dumplings by itself. You get ushered into tiny communal tables where you have absolutely no room to eat or talk or move or play with yourself under the table (what, don't tell me I'm the only one who does this at dinner) (well then you must not go to dinner with the people I go to dinner with).

Service is brisk, but nice, much as with your Auntie. They get you in and out quickly, much like me, if you visit my bedroom on a Friday night (ooh speaking of which it's Friday. Better get ready. Starlight, help me clean up and I'll give you Temptations).

So you need to get the Pan-Fried Pork-And-Chive dumplings. The most important element is the pan-fried part, because that's what this place specializes in. They come out looking like some sort of a pancake, with crispy brown fried bits connecting all of the dumplings together. But don't fear. These are, indeed dumplings, Jim. Just not as we know them.

Still one of the best places to eat in Toronto, and one of the reasons I come up here often (do you come here often?) along with the Creme Brulee donut at Von Doughnuts, the scoops at Ed's, the Loukamades from Athens Pastries, the Banh Mi Boys, the custard fish at Kevin's Taiyyaki, and a few other gems around the city.

Anyway, skip your kids' fave place (Munchkin House), the gym (Pumping House), the other gym you pay for but never go to (Dumbbell House), the place that sells kids books (Rumplestiltskin House), the hospital where you always get sick (Mumps House), and the brothel (Humping House), and come here instead. There is no better place to get piping hot goo sprayed right down your throat from the merest of nibbles."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite for good Chinese food. A lot of U of T students head to New Ho King of Canton Chili, but this place tastes better, seems healthier, and has comparable prices. The beef with broccoli is amazing. The dumplings are obviously great too. I've never had a bad meal here. The service is good, not great, but good enough (as in, you might have to wait a few minutes to get water, but in terms of ordering your food and getting it delivered quickly, it is very good). It can be a bit loud, but not so much that you can't have a conversation. Honestly, if you're looking for a good meal, go here. As well, the longest I've had to wait was probably about 10 minutes on a Thursday night at about 6:30 which is really good considering the location. The waiters are also a lot more friendy than nearby places."}
{"text":"Pros:

- The dumplings. One of best in the GTA. There are a variety of fillings to choose from and best of all (for those who are indecisive when it comes to food like me), you get the option to choose three different fillings for only a dollar more ($8.98)! I ended up getting pork/chives, spinach/black mushrooms and seafood/chives for the three fillings. I came in really hungry and left full. 

- The staff are attentive and accommodating.

- Clean and nicely decorated (albeit a bit stereotypical) interior. 


Cons:

- Cash only. They should consider getting a POS system, especially since business is so good."}
{"text":"Fried pork/chive dumplings were well-flavored but SO greasy!!! I like the crispy lace running through the pan's worth (but also very greasy). Do not recommend the scallion pancake: it was flaky like a pie (not bad) but bland--with a complete absence of scallions. I've had better!"}
{"text":"You can see the making the dumpling fillings fresh on the spot through the window!
I was happy they had lamb filling, which I tried. 
I would definitely get the fried versions; the bottom is super crispy and not too oily! 
Very fresh fillings, would come back again to fix a dumpling craving!"}
{"text":"This restaurant makes and serves the best Singapore Noodles and Vinegar Potatoes I've ever eaten. The service was quick but I didn't feel like I was being rushed through dinner. The only drawback is they only accept cash as form of payment. No electronic payments available."}
{"text":"OK, I don't often go out specifically to get dumplings so I don't really have a way to compare to other places, but the food here was fabulous.  

First: if you order 12 dumplings, it's likely you won't really need anything else, especially if you're only two people.  My husband and I made the mistake of ordering two entrees and the dumplings and we had way too much food.  In the future, I'd order one entree to share and the dumplings.  

Second: get the fried dumplings.  They were delicious and come in sets of four.  We tried lamb, veggie, and shrimp and enjoyed all of them.  I ordered some kind of bean curd entree and didn't really care for it that much.  It was spicy but kind of weirdly textured and I'd skip it next time.  However, my husband ordered the orange chicken and it was DELICIOUS.  The pieces were super crisp and drenched in delicious sauce.  Yum.  

Beware of a few things: this place is pretty busy, especially during the dinner hour.  It's also fairly hot in here.  I'm not sure if they had air or what but it was really hot outside and it wasn't much better in here.  Things got a bit cooler once we sat and weren't really moving, but it was pretty warm.  Also, your dumplings are likely to come out way after your other food so keep that in mind so you don't totally fill up on everything else and have no room for dumplings.

Our entire bill was like $35CAD which was like $26US.  Totally worth it, especially since it included a ton of dumplings, entrees, and pop."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, I didn't order dumplings. I was treated at this restaurant by a friend recently. The dumplings here are really good. I recommend the seafood, celery, and shrimp dumplings. I like the appetizer dish as well. Therefore I want to change my rating to be 3 instead of 1. This place is called dumpling house, and it offers delicious dumplings despite bad Chinese dish. BUT this place is not clean. I found remains on the plate from precious clients. If you google this restaurant, you know it was temporarily shut down because of mice founded 8 years ago. I will give the dumpling 4 stars, but overall 3 stars maximum."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside but the food is pretty killer and the portions are ridiculous. 

Upon entry I was first turned off by the fact the gentleman at the register sat me at a table with a family. Don't get me wrong, I can do social dining but I felt it was because he wanted to save a table for a group of 4. In any case, almost immediately after being seated, a waitress. Offered me my own table. No harm no foul.

As for the food, I probably tripped them up because I ordered so much. I knew I had placed a sizable order but didn't realize how big the portions were. Being from Los Angeles, I expected quite a bit less. I ordered the Egg Drop Soup, Ten ingredient Fried Rice, Shrimp and Pork Dumplings as well as a trio of dumplings which included Minced Chicken, Lamb, and Beef. Usually, in LA, a dumpling order is 6pcs. Unbeknownst to me, here they are 15pcs. Hah

The soup came first. For $4 I expected a single portion. It was virtually a family portion (well enough for 2-3) then the fried rice came, it covered a 12\" plate and was 4\" high (I'm American by the way). I expected it to be large but was surprised when it came out. When I first received a plate of dumplings, I thought they put them all on one plate and I was staring at a huge meal. Then another plate of dumplings came. Oh my goodness. I started sweating just looking at all the food.

I, for some reason, think I can judge a Chinese restaurant based on their egg drop. It was absolutely delicious. It had the perfect saltiness and the egg was obviously put in really slowly, as you could eat it with chopsticks. The fried rice, though not the best, was good. It was cooked with a bit too much soy sauce but the shrimp, chicken, pork, etc really stood out and were cooked perfectly. The shrimp and pork dumplings were on point. Though not soup dumplings which I prefer (I've been spoiled by Din Tai Fung), the kitchen had the mix down and the wrappers were not too thick and were steamed just right. The others were more of a novelty order as I never had a Lamb or beef dumpling. I had to try them. The lamb was actually pretty good especially when dipped in black vinegar. The beef, I was not too impressed as I felt it tasted like plain ground beef wrapped in a wonton.

Well, I am no aficionado of dumplings but I love food and here they have great food at a great price. I got out of there spending $30 with tip for a lot of food that I would rate above average. In LA that would've been a $60 tab. Keep in mind my order could have easily fed 3 REASONABLE people.

Swing by and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The last few times I've gone to Dumpling House has been nothing but disappointing. I generally get the wonton soup and some pan fried dumplings. 

However the last time we went the food just fell short. The fried dumplings were much greasier than I remembered and the fillings were not as good and skimpy. Also, I can say that the green onion pancake is way better at Mother's Dumplings.

Also, service no longer exists here. The few times we've been before were fine for the most part, but as of recently I found that the waitresses was not attentive."}
{"text":"Food: 3 Stars
Service: 3 Stars
Ambience: 2 Stars


First off let me start by saying I love dumplings. I don't know why but I just do although I rarely have them in restaurants. Needless to say I was excited to come here and have some dumplings. Note that this place is cash only so be sure to pick some up prior to coming in here.

The menu had a decent selection of dumplings along with non-dumpling items such as noodles and fried rice. We ordered the pan fried pork and chives along with the Zha-Jiang noodles. I love the look of the fried dumplings all stuck together and golden brown . The taste was not bad. I usually have steamed dumplings so I was not sure when I noticed that most of our dumplings had burst open during the frying process and had no juices left in them. A few remained intact and seemed a bit more moist but again I cannot be sure if that is how it is supposed to be or whether it was poorly done. Either way I still enjoyed the dumplings.
The Zha-Jiang noodles were a little saltier than I would have liked. It was still ok but I have definitely tasted better elsewhere.

This place was packed when we arrived and people kept coming into the restaurant. The place is not that big so it definitely felt a little cramped. The service here was average but it was understandable given how busy they were.

Overall I was fine with the experience I had here as they aligned with my expectations. The food was decent and prices were inexpensive. I will eventually come back but I think I will try other dumping houses for now."}
{"text":"Great dumplings place. I only come here to get my pan fried dumplings cravings savored. This place is always busy so expect wait times do take out if you can. I usually do either pork and chive or vegetable only its very good. Expect to wait 15-20 minutes for orders to come out they are very fast on this. Nice and crispy dumplings and cheap too good meal and fast busy people. Like this tiny joint !!"}
{"text":"My son and I went here for lunch while visiting Toronto. We ordered the pork and scallion fried dumpling, the lamb dumpling (also fried) and the house sauteed noodle dish. The noodles were very good. Firm and full of flavor with a nice beef base sauce with cabbage, shrimp, beef and chicken. Really good serving size for the $6.95 price. The dumplings were in my opinion very good. Lets start with the fact that these were made to order.....not cooked to order but actually made into dumpling and cooked after they are ordered. The taste showed the care that was put into these babies!! All dumpling are served in the dozen per orderand they were very tasty. Great value....two orders of duplings, house special noodle dish and two sodas for $26.00!!! Try these dumplings you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Typically our first stop after a five hour drive from Detroit. Every time we come it never disappoints. Lines always out the door. Make sure you get the handmade dumplings. We typically get half and half (pan fried and steamed). They don't cheat on the fillings, very flavorful and satisfying. Giving it a four star as the service could use improvement."}
{"text":"Best steamed dumplings in the world. We live in Los Angeles and haven't been able to find any dumplings like these. And we've tried. So fresh and perfect. Every time we're in Toronto we come here."}
{"text":"Authentic Northern Chinese Dumplings! 
They make their own dough and filling. 

Try the fried pork ones - they're fantastic. Seafood and pork+celery were excellent as well. The dough is just enough and ohsochewy and inside, there's a delightful sip of soup along with the filling. Yum! 

Came around 5:30pm and got seated right away. Fast, friendly service. We wanted to switch tables and they were very gracious in accommodating the request. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize one order of dumplings gets you 15! We over-ordered but it was good!
Lots of leftovers. 

The dumplings are fresh and delicious and taste almost as good heated up the next day. ;) We tried both fried and steamed. Both good!

We also tried the Shanghai noodles. Pretty good this far from Shanghai.

Busy place but the service was good. Like. Will be back for more dumplings"}
{"text":"Had the chance to eat their handmade homemade dumplings & other yummy dishes. Anything you order you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"You can stand outside and watch them make dumplings, but you won't last long.  Just look through the front window and watch the ladies make each dumpling fresh, packaging some and cooking others.  Everything looks fresh, and--enough!  I can't take it anymore!  I'm going in!

This is a small establishment on Spadina, suitably located in Chinatown, a block from the Kensington area.  You walk in the narrow passage past the kitchen at the front of the store to the seating area in the back.  The simple menu is jammed with dumpling options, I chose the Pork and Shrimp fried dumplings.

In no time, a big plate of 12 dumplings arrived, crisp and golden on the bottoms, and beautifully cooked on the tops.  The dumplings are fried as a group, so when they plate them, they are just flipped upside down, leaving the crisp side up.  I have had a ton of dumplings over time, but this is a cut above.  It's like the first time you have a taco in a real tortilla instead of the usual packaged wraps, the dough was so fresh...

I hoovered the dumplings down, dipping each one in a bit of the dipping sauce in the table dispensers. A dozen dumplings for $6.99.  I could have ordered more, and I should have, but I really need a reason to go back.

This is a quaint place, with the decor of a typical well-worn restaurant oozing with character.  Eat in, or get 'em to go, just get some!"}
{"text":"China Town was completely overwhelming. How do you decide where to eat when there are so many options? In our case, you glace into a restaurant and see them making dumplings by hand... So you Yelp! them and you see people saying mostly good things. Seems like a good option and you're tired/hungry, so you pop in. Lucky for us, we immediately saw the \"cash only\" signs... Otherwise that would have been embarrassing. 
We were seated immediately and the restaurant was pretty full. We started glancing around and saw lots of delcious foods floating around tables. This was reassuring because the table was a little sticky and the condiments were not really clean. 
At the suggestion of other reviewers we got the green onion pancake and pork green onion dumplings. My husband also ordered General Tao's chicken with white rice. I found the pancake a little flavorless but the dumplings didn't disappoint. The General Tao's, however, was a little perplexing. It was the stickiest, most syrupy sauce we've ever had on a similar dish. And it was deep red, like red velvet red. It was full of peppers, but not really spicy. The chicken was good and breading was just right... But pieces came in inconsistent sizes, which made them difficult to eat with chopsticks. Also, all of our food came to the table at different times, with our dumplings coming last. Prices weren't bad though."}
{"text":"After spicy wings, Chinese dumplings are right up there as happy comfort food for me.  Yum yum.  And if you've wandered around Chinatown West near Kensington Market, you've probably noticed the window where you can see hundreds of dumplings being handmade with several bowls of tasty fillings.  Bring the kids. 

Now, some of youse guys might think I'm crazy for liking Dumpling House.  Yes, this is the same place that made sensationalist newspaper headlines a few months back because someone took a picture of vermin in the window, and then the place temporarily lost its \"PASS\" certification.  

Maybe I'm an optimist here, but I like to believe that people can correct themselves, and I think the place is much cleaner overall since those headlines.  

I'm glad, because this place is awesome, cheap, and awesome.   My fave option is the 12-count, 3-variety choice, where I embrace ecstacy with steamed pork and chive, beef, and lamb.  Other varieties include pork with fennel, pork with sour cabbage, shrimp, and more.  A plate of 12 and some of their complementary green tea makes for a hearty meal for less than $7. 

DH also offers fried dumplings, but I usually avoid those:  to me, a fried dumpling should be large and robust, just blackened on the edges from tumbling in the wok, but these dumplings are narrower and when fried, come out looking like oily store-bought breakfast crepes connected with lingering dough.  

My only other kvetch is that their chopsticks are of the thick, hard plastic variety, which seem to need a stronger grip in order for you to not lose your dumpling into your lap.  But, you know, if you do, they're so damned cheap... just order another plateful!"}
{"text":"They have the worse service. Food quality is below average. Not worth lining up for 20 mins or spending even 10$ on it."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Toronto. Great value. We also got the Gen Tso's chicken, sweet and sour chicken, chicken with broccoli and beef with peppers and onions. All very tasty!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this spot and grab a few dumplings for lunch. Waitress was very friendly. I ordered zhu rou jiu cai zheng jiao zi (steamed pork and chive dumplings). It was 15 pieces for $9.50. The texture was strange, the filling was underwhelming and it was not very filling. Would have rather bought a pack of frozen dumplings from T&T.  The other reason for my two star review was seeing the man who I presume was the owner walking around and picking his nose out in the open and handling food and transactions. And it wasn't just a swipe, he was digging aggressively. He also handed me my bill before I was halfway done with my meal which made me feel like he was rushing me. After my disappointing meal and ready to get the f out of there, I was told they only accepted cash and so I had to walk to a scotiabank to withdraw money. I returned to the man stuffing his nose again and when I handed him a 20, a part of me didn't want my change back. I only tried one dish and so I think it would be unfair of me to hand out a 1 star review and obviously taste can be very subjective. I'm sure they have better dishes however there's no telling which of those dishes have boogers in them..."}
{"text":"The dumplings are so good and soo cheap!!

Portions are huge. I used to go to mother's dumplings but I might start going here because of these things. The bill for two of us came to 14 bucks for something like 25 dumplings. I loved the fried ones but its good to get the steamed/boiled just to change it up. We left stuffed and so happy. Good place in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Tasty and authentic dumplings but slightly overpriced in my opinion. Try the steamed dumpling with shrimp and fried one with chives. Don't be scared by the inverted way they present your friend dumplings. One portion yields you 12 dumplings. Their non-dumpling dishes were disappointing, particularly their gooey chewy double-cooked pork belly. Service was nice."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese restaurants i have ever eaten at. Period!  watch them make dumplings in the window while you wait for a table, since there is usually a line out the door.  Couldnt decide whether to have dumplings steamed or fried, so we had both...YUM!  The other dishes were also fantastic, with huge helpings: General Tao's chicken, twice cooked pork, black fungus salad teeming with braised baby bok choy...the real deal."}
{"text":"Fresh made dumplings to order with many different variations in meat. I'm a big dumpling fan. Tried their steamed pork and chive, pork and chive with dried shrimps, pork and shrimp, and fried lamb, and spinach with mushrooms. All the meat were flavorful, the spinach with mushroom not so much. It definitely feels home made. The only things I did not like were the chewy and thick skin and the lack of meat or veggies in each dumpling. Servers were very friendly. Place a bit small but comfortable. It was easy to identify the female owner many people mention here but no yelling and screaming or making anyone cry today :)"}
{"text":"Came here a little after 5pm on a weeknight, with a party of 5 in total. We ordered 4 plates of dumplings (3 steamed, 1 fried) and a small dish of \"semi-cooked potato threads\". It came out to a total of around $37, which is definitely very reasonable, considering each plate of dumplings had 15 pieces each!

Best dumplings were the lamb ones, seafood was subpar and less juicy. The pan-fried dumplings weren't that great, since the skins seemed thicker. The small dish was a little spicy, topped with a lot of carrots and cilantro, and saltier than I'd preferred.

It is a small restaurant, so the seats are really limited and at the end of our meal, we got the bill right after clearing off our plates without asking, so that was definitely slightly unexpected. Although they did have a line-up out the door, the service seemed a little rude.

Overall, food is inexpensive and really quick. Keep in mind they take cash only though."}
{"text":"Came here craving for dumplings and it definitely got the spot.

Love the open kitchen, everyone can see exactly what's going on. The restaurant itself looks fairly clean. They sell dumplings to go as well, about $4.50 for a dozen.

Can't go wrong with the steamed or the fried. If you watch the chef do the fried dumplings, I wonder why the cook top is so low compared to the rest of the cook tops. He has to bend down to fry them up.

Pork and chive, pork and vegetable, shrimp and pork are all delicious.

For a quick fix and cheap eats, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Handmade potstickers fried to extra crispiness. Great flavour. At a cheap price. In a clean restaurant. Nuff said."}
{"text":"So just to be straight, I really like dumplings, don't get them often, so its great to find a proper Chinatown again that has the type of restaurants I crave.  We read reviews and this place lives up to what everyone else is saying in my opinion.  We went for the pan fried dumplings, which I have never had, so had to try, great how they flip them over after being cooked to keep them from sticking on the plate and creating a cool presentation.  We mixed it up with lamb, pork and shrimp, and pork and chive inside, well done, all really tasty, worth the extra dollar for the mix.  We also went for the Singapore noodles which came as a very large portion of thin noodles with pork and shrimp mixed in, very filling.   Because we were full we missed out on having soup and Shanghai noodles, guess there is going to be a next time.

Cash only as everyone else says.  A few signs hanging around say so, so wasn't a surprise.  The noodles plus dumplings and a coke with tip only came to $23, so no big deal.  There is a Scotiabank just a few doors south if you need the cash."}
{"text":"It's a normal place near Kensington market.  The dumplings are good, specially the pan fried ones.  The prices are good and they have so many options of dumplings.  Nothing remarkable, but its a good place for cheap food..."}
{"text":"Good enough dumplings that are cheap and filling. They used to have a great jellyfish salad but I don't think it's on the menu anymore. I believe this place had shut down in the past due to health violations but I almost expect that in the Chinatown area. I'm going to try mothers dumplings which I hear is better"}
{"text":"So Mother Dumpling across the street had a long line up and we didn't want to wait, so we wanted to give another restaurant a try. Seeing that the Dumpling House received a 4/5 star rating, we said \"why not?\". 
As soon as the food came, we knew immediately that they were poor quality. The fried dumplings aren't even closed properly, so there wasn't any juice or substance whatsoever. The boiled dumplings have more dough than meat/veggies. It was very disappointing. There's a reason why Mother Dumplings across the street is so popular. 
And the service... wow... so to preface my review on the service, I am of Chinese heritage. I grew up going to Chinese restaurants. This is not typical Chinese restaurant service. This waitress kept trying to take our plates away even when there was food on the table. We kept telling her no and she kept coming back to try to take our plates away. 

Never again will I return. Go to Mother Dumpling across the street. This place is extremely disappointing. The food quality is disappointing, and the service was horrendous."}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant and was greeted with a noseful of the most amazing-smelling dumplings I ever had the joy to smell (and later eat!) As my friends and I walked through the skinny entrance-way, and past the place where all of the dumplings are made, we were greeted by a friendly staff who led us to our table. We were seated right near the front, so we could see all the dumplings being made.

Before we ordered, our (very attractive, by the way) waiter brought us some tea. I was with two others, and we ordered a selection of 3 types of pan-fried dumplings, Shanghai noodles, and General chicken. All three were phenomenal. They brought the three out as separate courses; first the dumplings, then the noodles, then the chicken.

We got the beef, pork, and chicken dumplings. The chicken was by far the best. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It was flavourful and moist and it tasted just like heaven in fried dough. The shanghai noodles were perfect. I've never had such good ones before. The chicken was also very good, though it didn't quite live up to the expectations that the other two dishes had set.

The waiter frequently checked up on us, though not in an annoying way. We left completely satisfied, with leftovers to boot! We ended up paying a total of 30$, so 10$ each. For this quality of food, and with enough leftovers for another meal for each of us, it was a total steal!

This is definitely one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A great place for some cheap, authentic, and tasty dumplings."}
{"text":"d is for dumpling, which is good enough for me.
d is also for dummy which is what i was when i ate there.
d is for delight which is not exactly what i experienced while i ate there.

what the hell is this phonetic riddle about you ask (spiritedly or patiently)?

well, i had just finished a night of performing improv; being that i had just spent a good 25 minutes or so being vulnerable, exposing my innermost neuroses for all to see, i found myself to be a little peckish.

rather than risk a refusal on a late night dinner date, and specifically a date at the dumpling house, i went there alone.  so i walked in there, found out they only took cash, and promptly turned around to get some, leaving what i thought to be the kitchen staff finishing their dinner at the first few tables.

when i returned i, also like connie t, ordered a combo of three different dumpling flavours - obviously the most logical and foodie thing to do.  the dummy aspect of my alliterative riddle is that i let myself be suckered into getting them fried.  i was conscious of wanting to go the healthier way of steaming and asked for it that way but with minimal convincing (dictating) from the male half of the ownership, i ordered it fried.  what did he say that convinced (dictated) me so?  

\"The fried ones are better.\"

d is for dummy man. when i got the plate of dumplings, they were all stuck together by this crusty connection of dough perhaps?  i really dont know what the hell it was.  i saw him flip the frying pan over onto the plate and serve it to me.  i regretted his recommendation immediately.  it was just too oily.   it didnt stop me, however, from slowly devouring the plate with a little chinese mustard, soy sauce and vinegar while i watched the husband and wife ownership team separately read their own newspapers at different tables in silence.

now i think the choices are great - most often in chinese restaurants you just get some variation on pork, which can be great but three cheers for variety man.  i give it the four because of those choices and also because i believe that the steamed versions would have been much more palatable.

so to all you dummies out there, beware!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were walking around all day and decided on Chinese for a late lunch, then we saw this place. There were two older Chinese women in the front folding dumplings and a small line of people waiting for tables. The dining area is kind of small, decor was minimal. We waited for about 15 minutes and were seated. There were various items on the menu from noodles to rice, but mostly featuring dumplings. We ordered several things, chicken dumplings, pork fried dumplings, hot and sour soup, chicken noodle soup, beef stir fried noodles and a scallion pancake. It was a lot of food, we didn't realize until it was all on the table. First came the hot and sour soup, which was good, had all the elements of what it should have; hot, sour, mushrooms, chicken and good viscosity. Scallion pancake was not so much, very starchy, barely tasted the scallions and needed salt. My friends chicken noodle soup arrives, he took one bite and sip and gave me a disapproving face. He said it tasted like plain boiled chicken, no flavor in the soup at all. Stir fried beef was ok, a little greasy. The dumplings were amazing! Guess that's why its called the dumpling house. The chicken dumpling was moist and well balanced in tasting. The pork dumplings were fried in a pan and flipped bottom side up and had a bubble kind of a crust that was connected to all the dumplings in the pan, this was the best I've ever had, juicy, crispy and tasted great. Come here for the dumplings and nothing else."}
{"text":"I found the dumplings to be enjoyable. Not the best I've ever had but they're not the worst either. I will stop in if I'm craving dumplings and I'm in the area. However, I will not order any of their meal type dishes ever again. I've been there a  few times with friends and ordered full meals. The meals were never very good."}
{"text":"Incredible dumplings! Man, I am craving for them already.

while visiting Toronto, we stopped by here for lunch on a Saturday around 3pm. The service was top notch and friendly. We had the minced chicken dumplings and stir fry vegetarian noodles, both of which were excellent!

Also we noticed the restaurant is high on cleanliness.  They kept cleaning the floors and tables couple of times when we were there.

Overall a quick joint to have some good and inexpensive dumplings!"}
{"text":"Update:  2nd time here and it was amazzzzzzzing!!!  Can't believe how good this place is!   So fresh, so delicious, and lots of food!  Yeah u may have to wait but its worth it.  cash only!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day with my girlfriend. Had chicken fried rice and fried pork and shrimp dumplings. Fresh, inexpensive and very polite staff. One server didn't know much English and would just walk away after you ask her a question, other than that great food. Would come again"}
{"text":"Nice little dumpling place in China town. We ordered 3 choice of steam dumpling and pan fried dumplings. The steam dumplings includes seafood dumpling, pork with sour chives and pork and shrimps. As for pan friend dumpling, we got pork and shrimps, pork and vegetables and chicken dumplings. The pan fried dumpling was amazing with a thin layer of delicious crust. However the steam dumpling seems pretty average. 

Overall, I really liked the pan friend dumpling. The steam dumplings are great but taste pretty average in comparison to normal dumplings. Extremely recommended for people who want ago have Chinese food and don't want to spend too much for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The dumplings are great and so are the side dishes they have. 4/5 for aesthetics inside is small, cramped, and dark. But they do have pick up and take away options!"}
{"text":"Chinatown's best dumpling hot spot! Always super busy with Chinese ladies making your order a la minute! The place is small so go early to get a spot. My favourite are the pan fried lamb dumplings, lamb dumplings and Shanghainese noodles. Pan froed dumplings are super crispy! I love this place! Cash only."}
{"text":"We always order out from here but came here with a friend today.  Service is quick but rushed.  If I wasn't there with a friend to talk then this place wouldn't be an issue.

Immediately after we finished a plate, it would be quickly cleared away.  While it usually isn't an issue I was a bit put off.  While we did chat a bit more after they cleared away everything, I could sense they were waiting to turn the table over.

Pan fried pork and chives dumplings are good if a bit greasy.  Vegetable fried rice was not bad, wouldn't say it was cheap or large but average.  For the same price I could have gotten a larger dish at New Ho King."}
{"text":"Cheap, good tasting noodles, but a little on the salty side. 

Huge bowl! I was with another person and the zha jiang noodles along with a plate of pancakes fried dumplings was too much. We had to ask for a takeout box."}
{"text":"Best place in China town to get dumplings and fried dumplings. The place got even better since they renovated. A fried dumplings with sweat and sour soup combo beats even the harshest weather outside. Only draw back is that the place can be quite busy some time."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here. Had the chicken noodle soup,  pork &  chive fried dumplings, and seafood steamed dumplings. Food was absolutely delicious,  but an hour later we both had a horrible stomachache and the shits. Stay away."}
{"text":"BEST pan fried dumpling in TO!
Small restaurant but always have line-ups."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Toronto by far. Normally I wouldn't order dumplings at a restaurant since I find the frozen ones from the supermarket to be decent enough. After dining here I'll never get frozen dumplings again. The steamed dumplings are my go to since you have the soup pour out when you bite into it and they're perfectly plump. The dumpling wrapper is perfect! I've found that the other dumpling restaurants I've been to in chinatown always have wrappers that are too thick.

Personally I did not find a plate of dumplings and an order of the egg drop soup to be enough for two people but I'm sure the fried dumplings are more filling with the grease. Highly recommend trying the steamed dumplings here!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago as I was craving the pan fried dumplings where it comes in one big sheet from the flour batter that gets fried with it. For some reason, I haven't found another place that does it like this and am surprised that more don't.

On first glance, it looks like they raised their menu prices. I haven't been here for 1-2 years so that's probably to be expected. Another odd thing was that I typically follow the rule of thumb that a good ethnic restaurant has a lot of people of the same ethnicity eating in the establishment. For some reason, the time that I went here, it was like 95% non-Asians. I felt out of place...like I stepped into a tourist trap.

Anyways, I ordered a dish of the pan fried dumplings and a bowl of noodles. The noodles were the ones that come in this black bean type sauce with meat and julienned vegetables. Unfortunately, the sauce tasted too salty and overpowered the rest of the ingredients. Perhaps confirming my suspicions that this might be a tourist place now since non-Asians typically like things more salty. The pan fried dumplings were good, albeit very oily, but they satisfied the craving for the unique texture of the fried batter.

Overall, I'll probably come back as I can't find another place that does pan fried dumplings the same way."}
{"text":"Pretty crowded for long weekend Monday and some wait for seating and serving.  The place is good for groups and and sharing dishes since there are no small or appy sized dishes.  I ordered the Wonton soup,  shrimp and pork pan fried dumplings and general tao chicken,  a long time favorite of mine,  to try three different types of cooking..

Not bad cooking overall, but the dumplings were a bit soggy, although I saw them being made in front of me, and the sauce on the Gen. Tao's chicken was too thick and sweet - like when they quickly mix it up, instead of taking time to do it properly.

Ok place to get chow, but don't go for the experience."}

{"text":"So far, the best dumplings in Toronto.

This place does a very nice job with their steamed and fried dumplings.  I think they use somewhat higher quality meats.  I quite enjoy the pork and fennel dumpling and get none of gritty pork one can find at some of the other dumpling places nearby.  The combination dumpling platter is quite good.  Another favorite dumpling is the veggie dumplings.

I also found a quite interesting dish here recently with a friend, spicy bean curd noodles.  It was noodles, fashioned from bean curds, and cooked in a wine sauce with jalapenos.  It's actually hot, so be careful if you don't like spicy.  Really interesting and well-executed.

The restaurant is clean and the food has been a success over 2 visits now.  It's not perfect, but the price is right."}
{"text":"3 flavours of steamed dumplings (spinach and mushroom, shrimp & pork, pork & chives) -$7.99 for 18
pan-fried dumplings - pork & chives - $ 6.99 for 12

I'm really glad I got the 3 flavours to keep things interesting, as well as mixing fried and steamed. Although the fried dumplings weren't too greasy, if everything was fried, it would have been a bit too much.

overall, it was a big hit with the S.O. and myself."}
{"text":"Fried dumplings are phenomenal, food is great in general but don't expect any service."}
{"text":"I am *obsessed*.  I come to Chinatown with the objective of trying a new restaurant, and end up coming here again and again.

If you look up \"economy of scale\" on Wikipedia (i.e., if you are a huge nerd), you might just see a picture of this place.  The ladies in the front furiously roll up the dumplings, the guys in the middle steam or pan-fry them to perfection, and the genial servers in their high-necked embroidered red coats sling them at you *piping hot* with speed and insouciance.  It's a beautiful thing, the kind of small business that runs on pure momentum and focus.

If you can wait to eat them until they cool enough not to sear off the top of your mouth, you will discover the joy of a single thing done perfectly.  Chive & pork, vegetable & shrimp, I have yet to try a better small bite of Chinese food at this price point, including at some of the toniest dim sum joints in the SF Bay Area.  Absurdly cheap -- stuff yourself silly with 15 fried and 15 steamed and roll out of there for less than $18.00 incl. tax, tip & tea."}
{"text":"One of my favourite dumpling places in Downtown Toronto! It's a little hidden and very easy to miss,  among the many, many restaurants/shops around Spadina/Dundas. 

The food is fantastic! House Noodle is a must try and actually is one of my favourite noodles, ever. My friends and I will always start with a plate, but it always ended up not being enough! 

The dumplings are also really great, deep fried beef and chives dumplings my favourite and so addictive! 

I've never been a huge fan of General Tao chicken, but my friends love it and we always end up ordering. It's decent, and I don't hate it. 

Dumpling house is hands down my go-to place when I crave good noodles and dumplings! Will definitely reco it to!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it for the first few dumplings. But the pan fried ones are VERY salty. If you know someone with high blood pressure, and you want them dead, this is the place for you.

Overall, it was ok. At least it was pretty cheap. But not tasty enough to compensate for the unhealthiness.

Despite it being late, service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on Sunday evening.  We ordered the following:

1) FRIED PORK & CHIVES DUMPLINGS: The fried dumplings perplexes me.  HOW do they come out in such a lattice structure?!  It was quite delicious, however, the amount of oil at the end sort of grossed me out.

2) MIXED PLATE (3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF DUMPLINGS): Please see above.

3) JELLYFISH: I love jellyfish, however, there was too much vinegar.  Way too much vinegar.  Also - felt more slimy that usual.  

4) BEEF NOODLE SOUP:  Perhaps I'm used to the Taiwanese beef noodle soups, but the beef wasn't the greatest, and the soup wasn't the best.

Overall, it was decent.   However, I feel like I've had better Chinese food.  I think the dumpling lattice was just a novelty for us."}
{"text":"This is my find find w.r.t dumplings in toronto. Most of the places I knew were in markham and yes, its no \"markham\" level. That being said, for the price ($8 for 18) you order, walk around for 10 mins, and pick them up...take them home...throw them in a soup broth or just eat them with your chili /vinegar sauce and you can't go wrong.

I do however agree, the wrapper is thicker than it usually is in other places. That being said, I'll gladly choose to eat these over the frozen bagged dumplings being sold in Oceans ANYDAY :) Fresh? yes. Handmade? yes. Hot? Yes

I'm sold."}
{"text":"Great fried and steamed dumplings. The eggplant was flavorful and cooked nicely. It gets very crowded in there with the narrow entrance but they prepare their takeout reasonably fast. I preferred the steamed dumplings to the fried ones but both were delicious."}
{"text":"Food (pork&chives dumplings 15 for $9) was excellent. The condiments on the side was a good touch for the customers to self explore their palates although the fillings of the dumplings  were flavoured enough to speak for itself. (MSG flavoured. Not so surprising, not a turn off too.)

The service, however, was a little strange. They have 3 servers and 1 boss. The waiter&waitresses were not very friendly or responsive. We waved our hands at them, and made eye contact, 3 times, but no acknowledgement nor response was given. We simply had to keep waiting until another waitress eventually show up to our table. Perhaps it was like the busser and server role that they have established in the small operating space that they were in that threw me off. 

The Price was good, but cash only, so inconvenience for the consumers."}
{"text":"Firstly, this restaurant only takes cash. They need to update their profile so it's not misleading. I had to go to the ATM after being declined to use my CC. Had a gut feeling this may happen so I yelped it before heading there. Totally misleading.

It was my first time visiting the Dumpling House, several friends had recommended this restaurant, so i ventured out to the city and found this place. The waitress recommended the pan-fried pork dumplings and spicy seaweed. Spicy seaweed had a generous portion size, it's more for sharing and not for individual consumption. I was pleasantly surprised when the pan-fried dumplings came out. The dish came out in a pie shape which had a thin layer of batter on top of the dumplings. The batter was very light, and the pork dumplings were stuffed just right, not too big, not too small. 

Price was very reasonable, the restaurant was small but clean, decor was simple but had a good vibe. I'd visit it again but will make sure to have cash on me."}
{"text":"Super great experience - had steamed pork and chive, and fried pork dumplings. Both were equally as tasty, made fresh to order and came quickly. Service was fast and friendly, and the bill was super cheap.

Definitely eat here.

Oh and the green onion pancake was delicious too. Not as fluffy as an authentic Chinese one but still delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My cousin suggested this location after my family and I helped her move into her new condo downtown... so afterwards we all went to Chinatown to try out this place. When we walked in, there was already a line up! luckily they had a big table open at the back for the 5 of us, so we happily sat down and started to look at the choices.

they have tons of options for dumplings... but of course being a dumpling house, some of their other shanghai dishes are pretty good too. We ordered their shanghai noodles (starry) and their soup noodles with braised beef. For dumplings we ordered both the steamed and the panfried dumplings with a variety of filling flavours. they actually have an option where you can make one order with 3 flavours so you get a few pieces of each flavour within that order.

Shanghai noodles ????:
the dish size was quite large and there was a lot of food for one plate! But i LOVE the noodles. I\"ve had my fair share of shanghai noodles, and i must say this was probably one of the best ones I've ever had. Their noodles don't taste like manufacturer's... I actually wonder if it was made in house - it had a nice spring to it, kinda like the equivalent of al dente pasta. I love the texture of the noodles, the sauce was very good. not overwhelming but quite tasty, along with the other ingredients of the dish, everything just worked really well together.

panfried dumplings ??:
the way they served them reminded me of the fried dumplings I ordered in Ding Tai Fung when i was in Taiwan. They serve it upside down and you break the 'crispy skin' that attaches them all together and the result is an amazing pan fried dumpling that isn't stuck to the plate! it also doesn't end up in oil pooling at the bottom because they served it this way. The pork and veg, the beef were both great. the shrimp was kind of milder tasting for those who don't like such intense and salty/savoury filings that would be great for them.

steamed dumplings ???:
These were classic, great overall. the skin is nice and soft, i love the juices are kept inside the dumpling until you bite into them :) again the shrimp one was kind of bland compared to the others, which my fianc√© loved because he doesn't care for too salty fillings. But I personally liked the pork ones with bok choy or with chives. the chives edges out because i find it's more fragrant than the bok choy.

Braised beef soup noodles ?????:
Now these are done just the same as the stir-fried so perhaps they are made in house. the broth wasn't too salty, which was nice. The beef was cooked well and the flavour was quite good, but maybe because this came after the stirfry it felt a bit more bland likely because of the soup broth. but overall this is a great dish for those that like ????? .

All in all, I was very surprised by how good the food was at this place. The dumplings are made fresh in-house, which you can see by the window at the front entrance of the restaurant. Its a small place, quite cosy and you can't sit there for very long because it's so busy. But, the portions are quite generous and the price isn't that expensive either. If you want good chinese food in Chinatown for a reasonable price and don't mind the wait? This is it :)"}
{"text":"Pretty typical small Chinese restaurant, but they make the dumplings in the front window which is cute. I came here for a quick lunch while I was visiting my company's Toronto office on Spadina Ave. I had the three different kinds of dumplings in one dish that they offer for 6.99. Pretty good deal and perfect for someone who wants to try and few different kinds without ordering three dishes.

I had the steamed:
Pork and Chive
Pork and Celery
Pork and Shrimp

The Pork and Chive was my favorite, and the Pork and Shrimp was better than most other places I've had. Really quick service. I would go back"}
{"text":"Tourist tripping in Toronto got us to China Town.  Yelp and the staff hand prepping the dumplings in the window brought us into dumping house.

Service:  We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering.  Our orders came out promptly and two servers checked on us throughout our visit.  The manager stopped by at the end to check on us which we appreciated.

Dumplings and misc: An order of steamed dumplings gets you 15 pieces and an order of Pan Fried dumplings gets you 12 pieces.  Both offer great value at 9.99.  What's great is you get to pick 3 different types for your order.  My steamed all stars: The Lamb and Pork and Chive.  I've never had lamb in a dumpling so I had to try it, glad I did.  Pan Fried all stars: Fried beef  the Fried Shrimp + Pork dumpling.  The house Special noodles was very tasty, I'd order again.  The bok choy topped with the yummy black mushrooms gets my veggies in so I feel healthy af.  Good quality dumplings that come to your table quickly.

Ambiance: It's a hole in the wall restaurant with above average considering it's size. There's a long community table down the center with tables surrounding it.  The open dining area was decorated with chinese ornaments and the mirrors on the wall make the area appear more spacious.  We had no issues with the dining area.

FYI.  This is a cash only establishment which is posted on several signs in the restaurant.  If you're out and about in the Toronto China Town area and want to have some fresh dumplings and/or other Chinese dishes, this is a great option to consider.  They make them fast, and you can be on your way quickly.  This is a lovely casual dumpling restaurant that offers really good value for the price.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Kensington at 10pm with a Montreal posse craving dumplings. Whipped out ze Yelps and discovered the #1 rated spot was around the corner and open for another hour. We ordered 4 kinds, about 14 dumplings per person, and despite the wise-eyed doubt of one dinner companion while ordering we plowed through them all, plus a cucumber garlic salad. 

Everything was the best. The pork and fennel was insane and I could eat like 100 of these every other day. The fried dumplings were delicate and gorgeous. Each pocket was lovingly made by hand in the front window by a multigenerational crew of laughing ladies. The cucumber and garlic in the salad were both super crisp and fresh and the flavour so intense it will burn the evil out of you, purify you and make you new. Super friendly service, tiny cute spot, but all that matters are the perfect dumplings and they are perfect."}
{"text":"My family and I were first timers in Canada and decided to grab some lunch in Chinatown. I must say that the food here was average and I do not recommend getting any seafood in it. The seafood like the shrimp fried rice gave a weird smell like wet dog as well as an awful aftertaste. However we got the dumplings and they were good, since they make their dumplings in house. However the customer service here was rude and in a rush. The restaurant is small and I understand that it was lunch hour, but the servers shouldn't be rude, especially talking trash with curse words about my family in Chinese, which we can understand."}
{"text":"This place dishes out a variety of other foods besides dumplings, but since their name is \"Dumpling House\", dumplings are what we ordered.  They were terrific.  15 for 5.99 (or 6.99 if you want a combination of varieties) are delicious and filling and come in a good variety of choices.  The pan fried versions are stuck together with crispy dough that looks like a doily.  You can watch them make them in the front window, which is quite interesting.

Not much atmosphere but service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Handmade dumplings, what more can you ask for? We walked in very late at night (15 minutes before they closed actually) and asked if we could order steamed pork and Chinese cabbage (#1) dumplings to go. They said yes and told us to wait while sitting down on the table. After around 10-15 minutes, I received hot steamy dumplings (15 for $8.99). Eating hot, steamy dumplings at 11pm was to die for! Not to mention that they came out directly out from the steam pot (you can watch them make the dumplings from the outside/inside of the shop)! Definitely would come back if I am craving for dumplings again. Would recommend!

NOTE: they only accept cash"}
{"text":"Great dumplings but ladies at the window making dumplings and chit chatting away should wear masks or something. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Delicious home made dumplings - both fried and steamed versions were equally good and came in large portions. For both steamed (15 pcs) and fried dumplings (12 pcs) we chose the variety of 3 choices which were all good. There really isn't a bad choice on the menu. We came early around 10AM and there were only a few occupied tables but the place quickly filled up during noon. I also ordered the warm soy milk which was fresh and so satisfying. Orders came out quickly so we were in and out in less than an hour. We were visiting from out of town but the dumplings were so good that we came back to order some more to bring home with us as a snack."}
{"text":"Yes, some things are worth waiting for, and this place is just that!

Has one of the best fried rice in the city, and I just love the fried dumplings (the patterned gimmick is just darling).

Worth the trip. Worth the wait. Worth the money!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been coming here for many years. It's my go to place for dumpling when I need a fix.. 

They're always busy when I go there like jammed packed and always have to wait but it's worth it..

I love the fact you can mix and match your dumplings if you wanted to.. We got 15 of the steamed dumplings pork & chives, pork & shrimp and spinach and black mushrooms.. An order of the pork & chive pan fried dumpling and a side of seaweed salad and garlic cucumber..

Everything came out in a fair timely manner and everything was great as always, it's always consistent and never changes.. Highly recommend if you like the taste of home style dumpling and are looking for a bang for your buck.."}
{"text":"Great dumplings for a great price! The owner could tell we were from out of town and came over to assist us in ordering. The table was small for 5 people, however when a nearby table opened up he pulled it to our table to give us more room. I highly recommend this treasure in the heart of Chinatown."}
{"text":"The dumpling festivities continue but this time in Toronto. We were beside Dumpling House after our foot massage so it would have been irresponsible not to stop in for a few bites.

Love how you can see the dumplings being made fresh from outside the window. There's three of them working like little bees non-stop.

While we waited for a table inside, we got to watch the open kitchen do their thing. It's small, cramped but they make it work. The wait was only about 10 minutes. 

- Green onion pancake (#50) ($4.99) - simple but delicious. Sometimes simple and fresh is best although the pancake was pretty greasy.

- Wonton soup (#87) ($5.99) - broth was excellent and the wontons were even better. Small but packed full of flavour.

- Lamb meat dumplings (#8) ($8.59) - you get 15 steamed dumplings. Lamb dumplings are my favourite and these were absolutely money. The filling tasted gamey, just the way I like 'em. None of this subdued lamb flavour garbage.

- Fried pork & chive dumplings (#17) ($7.99) - 12 pan fried dumplings. We went with the standard pork and chive dumplings which hit the spot.

Everything at the Dumpling House was freshly made, fast, tasty and cheap. Not sure what else you'd want but we were satisfied."}
{"text":"no frills cheap delicious dumplings. get some steamed and some fried for sure. also take some to go frozen for a midnight snack! we went a little later than prime dinner time and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, the place was packed. seating is a lil close together to be prepared to cozy up to your neighbor!"}
{"text":"I ordered a trio of steamed dumplings - mushroom & spinach, pork & chives, and pork & chinese cabbage. the taste was ok & the wrapper was too thick - almost like a perogie or samosa wrapper & not the wonderfully thin wrappers chinese dumplings are famous for. I would never go back."}
{"text":"iIonly tried one meal of the menu so i can only judge from that, i took the fried dumpling and i'm glad that i only chose this, i couldn't finish it, not because it was bad but really heavy.  

There is 12p and i chose beef, porc and veggie, all of them were really good! The crispiness was on point, it was a little bit oily but you could taste the filling. 
You have for your money its really cheap! 

The service was meh, i didn't really like the waitress, they clung on me to choose fast, i had no water and they clean my plate before i had finish.

But definitely i will go back for the food, i really want to try the steamed one next time!
i would recommend this place if you are looking for something good with low budget!
 
also ONLY CASH"}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings - looks kind of rundown from the outside but once you go inside, the renovations make for a somewhat pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"amazing dumplings, as promised.  Good location for walking"}
{"text":"One of my regular joints. Almost everything is perfect and so cheap. The chives and pork dumplings are indeed the best, the hot sour soup cleanses your nose. The green onion pancake is however dull. I gave also tried their sweet and sour chicken - loved it and egg and chives dumplings were also good. The service is attentive. The manager is charming. The only take cash so be prepared. Only tip: can the free tea be hot at least?"}
{"text":"Was craving dumplings and other Chinese food so we took a day trip to Toronto from Niagara. This definitely hit the spot! Good pork pan fried dumplings, scallion pancake and zha jiang mian. And very reasonable prices! Would come back again."}
{"text":"Wow. Had the pork and chives dumpling and it was one of the most delicious things I've had in a while. Absolutely incredible. Small place, but larking garage less than 2 min walk."}
{"text":"Bottom line. I lived in Taiwan for 3 years and became addicted to dumplings there. Traveling through Asia, I managed to sample a wide variety of these little pieces of awesome. As I traveled from place to place the king of dumplings was re-crowned time and time again. Upon my return home, a small shop in Kaohsiung held the title. I was depressed because I would never get great dumplings again... Until I found dumpling house. This is an institution and their dumplings now reign supreme. If you find a better dumpling anywhere else, I'll be shocked. The wrapping is perfect, the filling is tasty and the service is spot on. Long live the king."}
{"text":"Small casual dining, and the fried dumplings were killer. The noodles I wouldn't order again, but rather fill up on the pork dumplings. 12 per order, good price. They were made fresh to order, though a bit oily. To my taste, the dough is also a bit sweet, but I liked it."}
{"text":"Dumpling House is my go to place for dumplings in Chinatown. They have a huge variety of items on the menu that are not dumplings but I can't comment on them as I only tried dumplings there. 

As a pescetarian, I also did not order any dumplings with meat in it. I tried the shrimp steamed dumplings and they are great (especially with hot sauce!). I also tried the fried spinach dumplings which are super crunchy and tasty. 

The service is generally great but it can be challenging to grab the attention of the servers if you need napkins, want to order a drink etc so I suggest actually requesting those things as you're ordering."}
{"text":"The best dumplings I have ever had. We ordered lamb, pork and chives, seafood dumplings & egg shrimp and chive dumplings. Couldn't decide which ones are the best tasting ones as all of them were so so so good. 
The portion size was just right and we can even mix n match the splints in one portion. 
Service was excellent.....definitely going back."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto at Rogers Centre for a coaching clinic this past week-end and, after a very busy half-day/evening and late check-in to my hotel on Friday, I took a long walk around Queen and Dundas Streets, before deciding around 10 pm that I could use some good Chinese comfort food before heading back to the hotel. While I am a huge fan of Dim Sum/Chinese food, I'm not from Toronto so it was with some apprehension that I decided to give this place a try.

Despite the late hour (not sure there IS a late hour in this area on a Friday night but I visited around 10 pm), the place was packed, which is always a good sign (no matter what the time of day). I immediately noticed that it is not very big (maybe 10 - 12 tables) and, as with many quick Chinese places, has a cafeteria-style setting ... so don't expect much in the way of decor. I was quickly greeted, seated, and provided a menu. While the descriptions were not extensive, it was not long before I settled on a plate of Shanghai noodles (6.99) and a plate of pork dumplings (5.99). The waitress very politely confirmed my order (and that I didn't want anything else) because they were closing soon. I confirmed that I did not.

The noodles came first and the serving was HUGE, piping hot, and delicious. I initially thought that, with the dumpling order still to come, I probably could have gotten away with just the one dish but, after tasting them, I simply couldn't stop eating them. While they were fried, I didn't find them to be overly greasy.

Next came the dumplings. While I knew that the place was known for making them from scratch (you can't miss them as you pass them being made as you enter), I did not pay attention to just how many were actually included in each order ... 15 !!!! And for 5.99 !!!! I don't think I've ever encountered such an amazing deal in a restaurant before. In fact, when I realized how many were coming (after seeing them delivered to other tables), I started to worry that I had misunderstood the price and would be charged more for what I didn't want. However, the price was correct and they were also delicious, probably the best I've ever had. 

My only gripe is that they do not take credit or debit cards, only cash. However, I imagine that is probably how they keep their prices so low. Therefore, remember to bring enough cash.

All in all, terrific food and great value ... I will definitely return the next time I am downtown.

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Awful experience. Rude owner. Oily dumplings. Dirty, uncomfortable, very crowded space."}
{"text":"I've been here at least once a year for the past 6 years, it used to be a very family-styled restaurant and all dumplings were made at the front area, now there are only some. They have gotten a renovation on the restaurant and now the restaurant looks superb and possibly may have changed owners. In the past, it used to be only the people who cooked the dumplings at the front take your order and serve you, but now they have 2 servers on at a time . The servers were very friendly and nice, however I didn't experience any sort of introduction at the time, or really get to know their names or much of anything about them at all (more common in asian restaurants, so it is not a big deal). However I did find that the owner / manager, to be sloppy, he didn't wear the attire that is used for the FOH positions, rather a stained old blue shirt and jeans. I also went to the washrooms, which can be acquired by walking down some slippery steps. The washroom itself did not smell or look nice and the garbage can was overflowing with paper towels, the toilet itself was also very dirty.

I later ordered various types of dumplings both pan fried and boiled/regular, overall they were good. When comparing the taste, the boiled ones are the best because the fried dumplings that I ordered were drenched in oil (enough to fill a small dish used to hold the sauce). I also ordered a green onion pancake, which in the past was my favourite dish but now it, I would only rate it was average, if not below average, and once again drenched in oil and the portions were smaller. I do suggest trying the boiled lamb meat dumplings, the filling was very nice and was not too overwhelming. However the shrimp ones not the other hand were not too pleasing, the shrimp turned out mushy and one of the plates were slightly under cooked. The busser noticed my parents talking to each other about the uncooked dish and asked if anything was wrong. When we told him about the dish. He brought it back to the kitchen and had it further cooked to perfection before bringing it back out for us. The price is decent, not too different from other dumpling restaurants, expect at least $10 a person with tax and tips. Compared to the past, it increased by $2-3 per order on the menu however that is to be expected due to the rise in living and eating. Overall the experience was nice, and I was able to enjoy some time with my parents.

Pros: 
- Service was good, staff are very observant when it comes to refills and orders
- Fresh dumplings
- Gets to see part of the process of making the dumplings (however compared to the past, I do wish I would be able to see all of it)
- Various options on the menu

Cons:
- Very busy, its very hard to find a time when there is no waiting line (especially during dinner unless you have a really early meal)
- minimal seating (however more than they did before the renovation)
- pan fried dumplings is very oily and were slightly undercooked
- unsanitary washrooms"}
{"text":"I came here after the Koffee Krawl with a bunch of other Yelpers. I don't have much to add to their reviews. 

Steamed dumplings: as mentioned by others, they were really boiled and slipping and sliding all over the dish! To me, steamed dumplings should be served in those round bamboo containers. That is the only proper way. 

Green onion pancake: this was unfortunate, as it is my favourite 
Northern Chinese dim sum dish! When I go to 369 (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/369-shanghai-dim-sum-markham) with my family, they have to order a separate one just for me because i won't share... SO good. But Dumpling House's rendition was disappointing. All dough-y and dry. There was a mix up in our order and when they brought the 3rd one to the table, we said we didn't order it. They offered to give it to us for free, but nobody wanted it...

Fried dumplings: they fared better here, I think. I liked the beef dumplings best. Although it is sort of funny that they come all stuck together... 

Service was efficient. 

The place was really busy on Sunday afternoon and there are celebrity photos on the walls (Adrienne Clarkson, Lang Lang). I had high hopes... but I probably wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"The pork chive dumplings were pretty good. However, I got the fried one and its really oily. Furthermore, the shrimp fried rice was really salty. Service was pretty good tho. Got the food in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Key Features: Affordable made-to-order dumplings

Dumpling House gained a lot of notoriety a few years ago when a picture of a rat in the kitchen was circulated.  But, lets be fair, their kitchen is in the main window of the restaurant.  Most restaurants have an animal or two - plus they put 10 000 dollars into renovations after this, leaving it as - potentially - the cleanest place on the China Town strip.

They lost some of their charm, for me, once they started to clean up - but I'm sure most folks thought it was a big improvement.  The only throw back to the original restaurant is the bathroom in the basement.

If you want some steamed Dumplings, there's no reason not to check out Dumpling house.  Not only are the dumplings great, but the dipping sauce you can create really gives it the extra kick.

I suggest: 3 parts chili, 2 parts vinegar, 1 part soy.

On your way out, why not grab a Bahn Mi sandwich next door, and some Chinese buns from Ding Dongs across the street?"}
{"text":"Tried this place out after reading the rat stories (hahaha....) with a friend for dinner. We each ordered a different fried pork dumpling - an order of only pork, and another order of pork and chives. They came in this weird circle, all attached to each other, which was different but pretty cool. 

The dumplings felt a little small to me, and were ridiculously greasy. I love fried dumplings: my mom used to make them all the time at home, and I always order them when I can, and these were definitely too greasy. I would bite into them and have oil be dripping down into my plate - it was actually really gross. The dough wrappers are pretty good, and so are the fillings, but I could do without the pools of grease.

Solid dumplings - cheap, good and salty, but really really greasy. The restaurant in general seems clean, in contrast to the rat controversy. Honestly, I feel like the only reason they got outed was because their kitchen is open and in their window. Most Chinatown restaurants are probably just as bad, if not worse."}
{"text":"Walking by the restaurant on Spadina, you find a few people making dumplings right in-front of the window. This restaurant is amazing - I have yet to have a really bad experience. Yes, they increased the price for their sour cabbage dumplings to $9.99 compared to (if I remember correctly) $7.99, and yes, sometimes their dumplings are a bit overcooked.

Coming from a childhood where dumplings were my favorite food, I was taken aback by how good the sour cabbage dumplings are. Made with sour napa cabbage, these dumplings are the perfect mix of sour, salty, and umami. I generally love to dip my dumplings into the vinegar, but these are so good that I rarely do.

I am also a huge fan of dill dumplings. However, these dumplings here are not as good as the sour cabbage ones given it is a bit too salty. Regardless, it is likely one of the best in Toronto.

When you venture outside of the dumpling component, the main dishes are all quite good - better than what you would expect from a place called dumpling house.

The ambiance here is fairly low-rent and the store is often very packed, but what more can you ask for? I come here very often (off peak hours obviously) and will continue to go here often."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for fresh, juicy dumplings, for cheap.

What we ordered:
3 flavours of steamed dumplings (seafood, shrimp & pork, pork & chives) -$5.99 for 12
pan-fried dumplings - pork & chives - $ 5.99 for 12
fried green onion cake - $ 2.99

What we liked:
The steamed dumplings are in reality boiled dumplings, and they come with lots of water, and the skin is a bit thick and not particularly appetizing-looking. However, there is something juicy and yummy about them and we finished them all in short order

The pan-fried dumplings do come all attached with this strange lattice-like crisp linking them together - but they were quite tasty and i enjoyed them even more than the steamed ones

What we didn't like:
The fried green onion pancake was just dough-y and didn't have much flavour

They didn't have ginger for my vinegar for dipping my dumplings

The place looks kind of ghetto, though they did display a green \"PASS\" sign on their front door.

The Verdict:
A good solid choice for tasty dumplings in chinatown, at a good price. The portions are generous with a sizeable portion of meat in each dumpling. However, I can't say there is anything particularly special about this place, and I couldn't help thinking we could've made this same meal at home with frozen dumplings bought from a chinese supermarket. And I could slice up some ginger to go into my vinegar :P"}
{"text":"I felt like I was on set of a Chinatown scene in a Hollywood movie where we were puffing and huffing from the hot dumplings, and sitting in a crammed space decorated tacky red Chinese trinkets. 

The tables must have been forgotten to be wiped in a 1000 years because the layers of grease and dirt has piled up in a crease around the edge of the table, and I felt like I sat in someone's sweat and when I left my derri√®re for the washroom I felt this nice peeling feeling with the sticky chair.  Shouldn't have left the Lysol at home. 

Journey to and back from the washroom didn't stir up my appetite as I descended and ascended from the dirty and stinky stairs, gosh this place reminds me of the hole in wall ones in China. 

Nonetheless the food did lift up my spirit. We ordered cabbage and pork steamed dumpling, chive and pork steamed dumpling, and panfried cabbage and pork dumpling. 

The pan fired ones had a thin layer of crunch that connects all the dumplings, see photo. And the dumplings were served \"face-down\". We loved the juiciness and the portion of the filling, and the skin was not too doughy nor thick. 

The steamed ones were especially juice and man I'd love to order some to take home. 

The garlic cucumber salad with a hint of spiciness and a sprinkle of cilantro was very refreshing. I like how it lighten up the meaty or greasy feeling in between the bites. At around five dollars per serving it was not bad. 

Seeing the sanitary condition of this place, I think I rather just buy takeout or buy pre-frozen ones and make them at home. 

Cheerio!"}
{"text":"This place is decent for dumplings! I prefer the pan fried over the steamed mainly because it looked more appetizing. The steamed dumplings' skin wasn't as smooth as I am used to but my friend said they tasted good. I like that they large amounts of dumplings (12-15 - I cannot remember) for roughly $9. There's also an option to choose up to 3 kinds in one dish in case you're indecisive like me or what to try out different stuffing. 

I ordered lamb, pork & shrimp, and pork dumplings. I liked the pork & shrimp the best."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and enjoyed it. It was great value for the money as well.

We ordered a beef noodle soup, which was ok but kind of bland, and an order of steamed dumplings fennel, pork and chive and something else that doesn't come to mind right now. As always, the pork and chive were the best, though the other two were nice. 

The dumplings however were fantastic, they were reasonably priced, the restaurant was clean, service was friendly.  Definitely one of the better values we got, and a very nice meal.

With thousands of other options around, i would still go back to this place."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. I always get pan fried pork and shrimp and steamed pork and celery. So good! Also I enjoy the shanghai pork fried noodles. Greasy goodness. Service can be a bit better but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything is great. Famous for the pan fried dumplings. You can mix and match! I loved the Chicken in wine sauce"}
{"text":"I could give a solid five star if the service was a little more welcoming. I understand that they are mostly busy and they are trying to encourage people to eat and leave asap so the new ones can sit down, but I've seen times when half of the restaurant was empty. 

Otherwise the dumplings are to die for. If you are not sure about which ones to get, definitely go for the pork and chives. If you feel adventurous; they are offering a 3choice option where you can mix 3 different flavors. They come in 12 or 15 counts, very fulfilling, definitely enough for two people. You can also share a soup as an appetizer; for example the delicious hot and sour or the wonton in clear broth. It makes my mouth water only by thinking about it.   

Cash only; you are looking to pay about $25-$30 for two people usually excluding tip. Dumplings don't travel well, they lose their juicy content and soft texture since they are made freshly. 

Such a delicacy!"}
{"text":"Crossed paths with this place while looking for Mother's Dumplings.... 

I wanted to try this place because I was hungry and wanted a snack.  

We ordered the Pork and Chives - $5.99 for 12 - Steamed 

It was good a little more give in the flour dough. The taste just doesn't have that oomph taste like Mother's. But overall a decent  restaurant with freshly prepared dumplings."}
{"text":"My husband and I always come here for some good, cheap eats and Dumpling House never disappoints.

Their dumplings are made fresh - we prefer the pan fried ones over the steamed, pork and chive to be more specific.  12 delicious dumplings for $6 - can't go wrong.  The sauces they provide with the dumplings are good, too.  I prefer that red (sort of tastes like sweet and sour?) sauce and the slightly sour soy sauce (not sure if it's mixed with some kind of vinegar).

We also get the beef fried rice which is delicious and it seems like they make it in no time.  A full plate will cost you $7.

The service is quick and friendly.

The food is a little on the greasy side, but eh, you'll live."}
{"text":"pretty great dumplings. got pan fried. they come all stuck together. one order is 12 dumplings. probably best to come here with 4 people to try a ton of stuff. long line is worth it."}
{"text":"The dumplings are okay, not great not bad either. I hated having to wait 20+ minutes for our food."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! We were wandering around Chinatown and this place caught me eye because you can see them making the dumplings through the front window. The place is small and was packed with people who seemed to be regulars. We split an order of dried dumplings and a noodle dish. SO MUCH FOOD came (the noodle bowl was huge) that I thought that there was no way that we would eat it all. It was delicious and we ended up eating every last noodle! The one regret that I have is that we didn't order the green onion pancake- it seemed like every other table ordered one and it looked super!! I'm very glad that we happened upon Dumpling House, it was great and our bill only came to about $20 (including my drink and 2 spring rolls)- a damn fine deal! 
The only downsides that I noticed- soda comes in cans (as opposed to fountains), the place is very crowded (so you might kinda feel like you are eating with another couple/ group), and they only take cash."}
{"text":"So most of this review will be comparing it to Mother's Dumplings which I've been to 15-20 times probably.

First off, I prefer Mother's Dumplings. Second, I would go back to the Dumpling House.   I have found at Mother's Dumplings it usually work out to 15 dollars a head (which is so reasonable) but Dumpling House works out to about 10 per head. If you are looking for an affordable meal, made fresh... Dumpling House is a great option. FYI I think the pork and chive dumplings were the best.

Why I prefer Mother Dumplings...
I prefer their steamed dumplings. I find that the dough has more of a tooth to it. Like how pasta should be cooked. I also find that they have a larger selection of fillings, and they are more \"fun\" (creative). You can get pork and chive at both places, but only mothers dumplings has beef and chive. Dumpling House just has plain beef. Also, Mother Dumplings has a great whole wheat dumpling with pickled cabbage. When it comes to the green onion pancake, Mother's has more onion and flavour (although it is smaller).

So Dumpling House is totally worth checking out, but if you have one day in Toronto I'd recommend Mother's Dumplings instead."}
{"text":"After reading my first review over again, I elected to return with a larger group. Worth it.
I discovered the caked-on something that holds the pan-fried dumplings together is potato and safe for human consumption (like that would have stopped me...).
The stuff inside the dumplings was not ground this time, which makes for a more identifiable dumpling but loses the squirt of liquid one received in their mouth upon biting down. Fair trade.
Tried the Ma Po tofu- garlicky and delightfully spicy despite not mentioning the latter on the menu (but seriously, why order it if you don't know what it is). Pieces of part-cooked onion and green pepper spotted throughout made it a great balanced dish.
Still recommended and 4/5."}
{"text":"Fantastic dumplings; fantastic prices; don't order anything else on the menu except dumplings.  15 boiled or 12 fried dumplings for $7, this is impossibly good value for Toronto.  They are great dumplings too.

I tried the Singapore noodles, possibly the worst I've ever had.

So be sensible, come here with a friend and get one portion of fried and one portion of boiled dumplings, eat well and leave happy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh and tasty dumplings, Dumpling House is your go to. The restaurant isn't that big however depending on the size of your group, you usually don't wait more than 5-10mins. 

Both their pan-fried and steamed dumplings are good. Pork and Chive, Lamb and Veggie are all popular choices. Pan fried serves up 12 dumplings and Steamed 15.  I've also tried their hot and sour soup a few times - it's a nice appetizer for a cold winter day and its quite big (enough to serve 5 small bowls)

They do have other food menu items such as noodles, meats, and veggies but most people usually order dumplings.

Only drawback is that they only take Cash. Some local ATMs from BMO, RBC, and TD are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want cheap dumplings. Generally fast service, with nice portion sizes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great dumplings - Definitely lives up to its name! We had the pork & chive and mixed vegetable dumplings, pan fried and steamed respectively. They were both good. A little bland, but I love spicy food so i just added spice and soy sauce and it was perf. Nice little stop."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I must say that I went here with high expectations based on other yelp reviews. We got the fried shrimp and vegetable dumplings, which were good, and also had the bean curd and cucumber with garlic and soy sauce, which was great. While eating, I witnessed one of the waitresses filling up the sauce containers. This girl was literally scooping extra sauce that fell on the table up with her hands and jamming it into the containers which had come off of all the tables. She then proceeded to sneeze into said hands and resume the filling. She then used these same hands to clean the lids of the containers in which the sauces are kept. This whole process thoroughly disgusted me and I quickly lost my appetite. I'll give this place 2 stars because our food and service were decent, but take 3 out for the repeated unsanitary behavior I witnessed while being in this shop for less than an hour. It would also be nice to see your servers wash their hands between cleaning tables, cleaning the floors and serving our food."}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings at really cheap prices. You can get a combo of 3 so that gives you a chance to try multiple varieties. We tried the fried and steamed versions along with the green onion pancake. They had 2 vegetarian options - spinach/mushroom and mixed vegetables. The fried spinach/mushroom dumplings were my favorite! Very crunchy and fresh. You can watch them make the dumplings at the front of the restaurant. The steamed dumplings were very good too. The green onion pancake had a lot of dough so wasn't really that good. Living in the Bay Area I thought I've had good dumplings before but these ones really blew my mind."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh food! The place is clean, we love the friendly staff! Always very delicious food! Authentic and all handmade! Try the hot and sour soup with your dumplings!"}
{"text":"Stay away from the dumplings and try the noodles instead.  Seriously.  For a place that professes to be a dumpling house, the dumplings were seriously unimpressive.  However, the noodles that we've taken out from there have been better than average for Spadina.  The jajamyeon was rich and thick."}
{"text":"The dumplings are the best I have tasted outside of China! I opted for the pork and chive dumplings and mapo dofu dish. The mapo dofu was not spicy, and had very little flavor without adding spicy pepper sauce that is located at every table. 

Guess this is why they call it Dumpling House and not Tofu House..."}
{"text":"The fan fried dumplings here are legit. Just like our favourite Taiwanese place in Vancouver and the steamed dumplings are pretty good too. Stay away from their noodle dishes. They don't make noodles here - just the dumplings so the quality of their noodles seems very low compared with the dumplings. We were also really underwhelmed with the flavours of the sauces. Go for the dumplings and don't stray into other areas of the menu and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Chinese food. Any Asian food, actually. 

My 17 year old daughter and I were in town from Minneapolis and looked forward to getting some really great Chinese food. We were not disappointed. 

We hopped on Yelp, found a great place two blocks away, walked in, and immediately walked out. Thank goodness I saw the \"only cash\" sign. 

After a trip to the nearby ATM, we were back. Ordered hot and sour soup. Waitress recommended a large bowl for the two of us. It was enough for four but we finished it. So good. So hungry. 

We the ordered a plate of assorted steamed dumplings: lamb, pork, and pork/shrimp. The dumplings were literally made while we waited. You can't get fresher than that. So good. 

Total bill: $18. And total satisfaction."}
{"text":"Came for a quick take out for dumplings yesterday.  Many choices but just order the pan fried pork dumpling (12 for $6.99 plus tax).  Food is made to order.  You can watch the step by step process as your order is placed (i.e. dumplings are wrapped in the storefront and fried in the open kitchen).  Friendly service.  The dumplings are crispy and juicy albeit moderately filled parcels.  Soy sauce, vinegar and hot sauce are of the prepackage vary but lucky not bad in the lease.  Comfortable space and clean.  Saw the lady cook the dumplings with some sorta broth/liquid which may be the reason for the ubiquitous \"lattice,\" crispy flakes that come with each dumpling order.  Unique.  Great textural contrast makes for numerous tasty bites (i.e. plump, juicy, crispy, salty, tangy and spicy).  Yum."}
{"text":"Awesome dumplings. 2 dishes enough for 2-3 people. Had pan fried shrimp+pork, and steamed pork + chive. Delicious w soysauce and some spicy sauce added."}
{"text":"One of my favs in Toronto. Great value on great food. It's not the atmosphere nor the food of a 5 star restaurant but for the price it can't be beat. 
  Both the pork and cabbage steamed and pan-fried dumplings are amazing. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's our go to place for dumplings- we came here once over a year ago, and we've been coming here at least once every 2 weeks.

Almost everything is under $10 and you get huge portions.

Service is okay- but don't expect to be waited on hand and foot!

Good quality food at affordable prices"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place..she takes after the three choice steam dumpling while I'm a big fan of their equivalent fried dumplings. They have excellent noodles and other dishes as well. Service is really quick and prices are at the median line for Chinatown restaurants in toronto. Best dumpling joint in toronto by a margin!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday. Found a cockroach in the cold dish we ordered. I've been here several times with friends and I didn't have a high expectation for the hygiene condition here. But cockroach in the dish?!!!! What made us angry is the owner(or the manager)'s attitude. I will never come back again, and I hope other customers be aware of it."}
{"text":"The line was out the door, so prep yourself for a small wait. Nice atmosphere and fast paced. Surprisingly, the pan fried dumpling were much better than the steamed. Pork and chive, shrimp and pork, shrimp and veggies and the chicken dumplings were excellent. Lamb was a bit strong tasting for me. 
Don't forget, it's cash only!!"}
{"text":"We almost left when we arrived at Dumpling House on Saturday night and saw that every table was occupied, but I'm glad we stayed!
 
Another couple soon finished their meal, and we were soon seated. My husband was a good sport about ordering all vegetarian dishes so we could share everything (he eats meat, but I don't). We had the steamed spinach and black mushroom dumplings, the fried mixed vegetable dumplings, and spicy bean curd noodles.
 
The spicy bean curd noodles were good, but not spicy. This was easy to fix with some chili paste, which was among the various condiments on our table. While not assertive in flavor, I liked the steamed spinach and black mushroom dumplings a lot. The fried mixed vegetable dumplings looked impressive, but were bland--unlike the spinach and mushroom dumplings, where I could really taste both the spinach and mushroom, I couldn't taste much. I'd skip the mixed vegetable dumplings if I visited again.
 
We couldn't finish all our dumplings, so we got a box to take the leftovers with us. The servers are very efficient about clearing tables, giving you your check and any change, so don't expect to linger here (as is true in many Chinese restaurants). Fast, tasty and affordable-Dumpling House and I are good."}
{"text":"This is a cute little dumpling place that's pretty neat because you can watch the dumplings being made from the windows!

The service was not bad. We had to wait a bit for our food, but it wasn't too long of a wait.

I ordered the three choices of Steamed Dumplings (Pork & Shrimp, Seafood, and Pork & Sour Cabbage - $8.99) and the three choices of Pan Fried Dumplings (Pork & Shrimp, Shrimp & Veggie, and Chicken - $8.99). They were pretty good, but not anything special. I love my dumplings though so I'm no complaining! My favourites were the Pork & Shrimp for both the steamed and pan friend dumplings!

Overall I give this place a 3/5! I love dumplings so I'll definitely come back to try some of the other dumplings."}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap and huge portions. Only complaint is that it kinda smells at the tables at the back...."}
{"text":"Best dumpling restaurant I have been to. I live near by and like to buy their frozen dumplings to eat at home. Their non dumpling dishes are also great. They have the best Singapore noodles. Don't get the Shanghai noodles though. They're kind of greasy."}
{"text":"Most surly service ever. The decor is okay, but claustrophobic.

Mediocre dumplings. Mother's is better.

Had to go because others were going. Would never go if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for saying the fried dumplings were the best here. I normally like steamed ones....

But these fried ones were the way to go.  I thought they were  a huge pancake when I first walked in....I didn't realized they fry all 12 of your choices in one pan and they sear together.

We had the lamb, pork, and shrimp.   All very good with a nice dipping sauce

I knocked off a star because our platter had a lot of grease. 

Arrived by 2 pm and it was full of diners. Very popular place. I like how they make the dumplings in the window. Everything is cooked right in front.

We walked here after visiting the Casa Loma. Very raining day so nice to get inside and be served hot tea right away.  And the whole bill was seven bucks.  That's like 3 bucks each american. Wow!"}
{"text":"5* for the comfort, the low price, the friendly service and the delicious food!

this is one of the few places where I'd feel totally comfortable going to when I am by myself, it's a very warm home-like atmosphere and the portions are perfect for a one person meal. 

also, the last time I came, I feel like I experienced really great service. I walked in and some of the employees were having lunch but they jumped up to greet me with a smile and to give me a table. they also bring things to you immediately and are extremely attentive. 

also. the dumplings are just REALLY GREAT. I'd say they're the best ones in Chinatown. I have yet to be proven wrong."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend while  I was visiting Toronto with friends, and despite the small location they managed to push together enough tables for six of us. We ordered 3 plates of pan-fried dumplings (beef, chicken, and Pork), as well as garlic cucumber and a plate of steamed shrimp dumplings. Everything was incredibly delicious, though I think the fried beef dumplings and the garlic cucumber were my favorite- in fact we were fighting over the leftover garlic sauce to dip our dumplings in! Can't wait to visit again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Pork dumplings over the shrimp dumplings hands down. Each order of dumplings is priced pretty reasonable at $7.99, you get 15 prices but for $8.99, you get to Mix 3 different types. We ordered both steam and pan fried pork and cabbage, pork and chives and shrimp with veggies. We didn't like the shrimp dumplings but thought the pork dumplings were delicious.

I would have prefer the wraps to be a bit thinner and less doughy. My dad makes dumplings at home and I'm use to the thinner wraps with loads of meat. Also, the resto is pretty tight, could use a face life. I would still come back for my dumpling mix tho."}
{"text":"I chose the Dumpling House Restaurant as one of our stops because the reviews were consistently good, and $6 for 12 dumplings seemed like a great deal. Sure, there are cheaper dumplings in Chinatown, but I wanted to visit a restaurant whose dumplings came highly recommended. Unfortunately this restaurant only takes cash, and there is limited seating available. The ordering process was hectic, and confusing, so I quickly ordered steamed and fried dumplings, paid the cash and waited outside with my group. I did have to go in a few times to check if my order was ready because communication was poor, that I had no idea whether the staff would attempt to call me in when my order was ready. The actual dumplings themselves were good, and they did not lack in filling. The portions were generous, and most people admitted with shock that they did in fact prefer the steamed dumplings! This would be a place I would check out again, except that I would probably try to dine-in next time. Waiting around on the sidewalk on Spadina on a weekend is madness!

{"text":"There was an insect in my soup.

It's too bad because I'm a dumpling fiend and in spite of many a good meal I've had before, I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"We've been going here before the renovations and it's one of our go to favorites. I'm surprised I hadn't written a review! We always order veggie dumplings and hot and sour soup. They are my favorite dumplings in Toronto. It's a bit tight but we've always been able to accommodate our stroller and baby. Staff is always fast and efficient. Cash only!"}
{"text":"**They only accept cash** I had to walk an extra half mile looking for my bank to withdraw cash. But it was worth it. I ordered the mixed dumpling plate where I ordered vegetable dumpling, lamb and beef. The lamb was my personal favorite. It was rich in flavor. This place is legit and you can tell by the employees in the window rolling out fresh dough for the dumplings. Great pitstop after a long walk."}
{"text":"If you're craving dumplings, and need a cheap fix, you need to add this to your list of spots. 

Assorted dumplings always come fresh and they are hand rolled  everyday. We usually choose the mix and match, but I find the seafood and lamb options to be the best. 

If you have the freezer space, they even deliver frozen bags which you can store for later use.

Don't venture off too far though, their other items aren't as dependable and more than likely to tarnish your perception of them."}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing ! Amazing ! The restaurant is tucked away but it is worth it ! All the food is very tasty and they are sooooo quick ! We ordered and it was literally at our table in less than ten min (and on a Saturday night !)! We asked the waitress most recommended dumpling and she told us to get the pork and chive. I totally agree with her and recommend those dumplings. The food was also reasonably price. Just make sure to bring cash, they don't accept cards ! If I come back to toronto I'm definitely stopping here !"}
{"text":"The place is kind of Tiny, there is a line and they are clearly super populer. Yelper's like them. Heck yeah, let's go there, we jump drover 6-7 hours. We're super hungry. Like very hungry!
We get there and there'S a great variety all hand made goodness. The service was good and quick. It's cheap and amazing food. A must go! And a Must Return!"}
{"text":"Great dumplings at reasonable price. The only negative side is that they don't take credit or debit card. Make sure you have cash."}
{"text":"Cant believe I haven't reviewed this hole in the wall, cash only, fantabulous place. Love coming back for more every time Im in Chinatown. The dumplings are freshly prepared for all passersby to see. Chewy with the right consistency and on point and with 15 in a plate choose wisely! You want to try other things right? Portions are huge - Chinese pancake,  broccolli , tofu with soy sauce, fried rice all top notch. Never been disappointed with anything Ive had here. Service is quick, helps to know what you want since there is a lot to choose from.

Pace yourself though or you might have a hard time getting off your seat and dont forget the CASH. Cha ching!"}
{"text":"I'm never trusting Yelp reviews again. 363 reviewers gave this place a 4/5 stars overall? Service was bad, food was bad. My family was disgusted by the overall smell and cleanliness of the place. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Great spot for fresh dumplings made when you order.  Very traditional simple dumplings, flavored well, and fresh dough.  This place is nothing fancy, but they make great dumplings cheap!  The noodles in brown sauce is also very good! Good Experience overall and recommended for dumpling lovers."}
{"text":"36 plump fresh dumpling for only $10? You cannot go wrong with this great take out deal! Tried their dumpling for the very first time yesterday and I was impressed enough to write a review the very next day. There are a lot of 'dumpling houses' in this hood, but if you do have a craving for them, give this place a chance :) I think 'dumplings are my new comfort food. We had pork and bukchoi dumpling and they were perfect. More more pork than choi, seasoned but not salty, I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"This is small restaurant in heart of Chinatown and serves amazing dumplings. I am sure we all have tried steamed ones but fried ones are amazing here. Owner and staff of this place are very friendly and helps everyone in ordering food. It's pocket friendly and everything over here tastes really authentic. Place gets crowded in the evenings and when ever I go there is always queue."}
{"text":"Restroom super stinky, after I washed my hands, don't want to eat anymore, service very bad"}
{"text":"Not sure what the big hype is all about....I thought Toronto was known for its delicious Chinese food but oh boy was I wrong.  Perhaps we didn't eat at the right chinese establishment as this place was certainly below standard.

We ordered the pan fried pork and chive dumpling.  Yes the portion was huge for the price, but what does it matter if the product was substandard? The dough was way too thick and it lacked flavor at the same time. Only one side of the dumpling was crispy while the other side wasn't...um okay?!  We also ordered the famous cucumber and garlic as appetizer.  It started out well until we spotted a raw shrimp in between the cucumbers. When we questioned the waitstaff, he instinctively wanted to remove it by using his fingers (he stopped short of course and returned with chopsticks to remove it), but that was it, no real explanation.  I guess I shouldn't expect anything more since it was Chinatown.

Decor was relatively nice for the shop but the bathroom smelled terrible.  We did enjoy the chef special (shredded pork) with rice although it was quite greasy.

If you can make it out of downtown Toronto, stop by \"Ding Tai Fung\" in Markham instead.  The soup dumplings there were absolutely delicious and represent the true culture of dumplings!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here, and chose the 15 dumplings to share with a friend - you can mix 3 different kinds and the price is very reasonable (6.99 at this time) , and I chose the lamb,  shrimp seafood, and shrimp & pork. Lamb is my favorite.  The service was great, washrooms clean, and it was a great place to go on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"The wraps for the dumplings were too thick, and the pan fried dumplings were very oily with very little meat inside. The steamed dumplings were a bit better because they had more meat, some soup and were obviously not oily."}
{"text":"If you are wondering where to get dumplings in downtown Toronto, look no further. I  recommend pork with 'fennel' (actually dill leaves, but I am not about to pick a fight, it's rude to fight with your mouth full). And the bean curd salad, and the potato noodle salad, vegetable tofu soup, and well, pretty much everything once had on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here several times with my boyfriend and I... Its pretty good for the pan fried pork dumplings, and the green onion pancake (which I didn't find as appetizing) we drive from Uptown toronto just for the dumplings here.. I recommend this place, its super cheap as well, but a pretty small place. I usually park around the corner where there is an actual parkade."}
{"text":"Pretty good dumplings.

I have had takeout here before (dumplings 2 go!) but today I got to sit inside with a large group.

The place is busy and quite cramped for space. Tables are all very close together.

The owner (?) was super friendly and comped us some free pancakes. 

We sampled a few orders of steamed dumplings (1 beef, 1 pork & chive, 1 chicken and a seafood/shrimp one) and a few orders of the pan fried ones too.

I don't like how the steamed dumplings are served. They come out on a plate and they had a lot of water/condensation on them still which made them hard to eat. Otherwise they were fairly tasty. Cheap too ($5.99-$6.99 for 15 of the steamed ones, and $6.99-$7.99 for the fried kind)

Overall, I still much prefer Mother's Dumplings across the street. I just prefer the food there and the atmosphere/decor. 

Dumpling House did have better service though and is still definitely worth a visit if you are craving dumplings."}
{"text":"Did the President Obama came to this place?  Yes he did. This place has damn good dumplings. Sorry mom, this place makes better than you. I still love you though!

We ordered hot and sour soup, pork and shrimp dumplings and celery and pork dumplings. The food came lightning fast!  Man oh man, the dumplings are so good here!  Why can't they have another location near where I live?!  My and I really enjoy this place. Warms us up since it was chilly today. 

With all of my restaurant review, I always ask will I come back with my wife?  The answer is quite simply yes!!!

Food:  5/5
Ambience:  3/5
Service:  4/5
Cleanliness:  4/5"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of eating here twice during my stay in Toronto.  The dumplings are the best.  The first time I had steamed.  After seeing the pan fried dumplings I knew I needed to return.  I am glad I did."}
{"text":"Bad service, dirty and greasy tables and chairs, and the food isn't that great either. No idea how they were busy at the time we went even though it was hella hot inside. Avoid at all costs if you want to eat good dumplings."}
{"text":"it is fresh and prepared just for you, but it lacks something... some subtle aromotic touch, some tasty personnality. Thus, basic and not too expensive. (I think fried dumplings are definitively better than boiled in this place - and they don't have red Saracha spicy sauce - because more kind of Japanese-inspirated dumplings than Chinese)."}
{"text":"Decent if you want some Chinese dunplings quick. But not really comparable to what  you can have at home."}
{"text":"Had a craving for dumplings so what better place to come to than this! My boyfriend and I are quite indecisive and generally over order because we want to try everything. Today was no exception.  

The basics: An order of steamed dumplings (which is really boiled) comes in 15 pieces. An order of fried dumplings comes in 12 pieces. For an extra dollar they let you choose three different types of fillings for an order. 

We got the lamb dumplings fried. So good! These were crispy on the outside with warm flavourful lamb on the inside. Favourite of the meal.

For the steamed dumplings we tried chicken, pork and chives, and spinach and mushroom. These dumplings were over boiled and kinda mushy. The pork and chives are a classic and were probably my favourite of the steamed. It had nice flavoring. Chicken was okay. Spinach was a bit bland. Not much to say about these ones as they weren't very memorable except being left in the pot too long. 

Vinegar and soy sauce on the tables for dipping. You can see the ladies at the store front making them fresh. Overall I would come back here for my dumpling fix."}
{"text":"I might be in the minority here, but I really liked the dumplings at Dumpling House.  The boiled were good and the pan fried were even better.  I like how they leave them connected with the fried batter.  One drawback is that they cash only."}
{"text":"Service was pretty quick and easy. This place doesn't take credit card so make sure to have cash (and for some convenient reason, there are zero banks on the side of spadina!). The pork & chive dumplings are good and so is the spicy beef dish."}
{"text":"The best dumplings I have had in many years. For those of you who aren't familiar with this style of fried dumplings, they are very crispy on the bottom and perfectly steamed on the top. They are cooked in a covered pan with a bit of water in it. Dumplings are steam-cooked as the water evaporates, and then the bottom gets crispy-fried till golden brown after all the water is gone. As you can imagine, this is easier said than done. This restaurant does a perfect job.

I had 12 fried dumplings and they were great. They were not greasy at all, and the texture is much more complex than steamed. I am going back there tomorrow for more!"}
{"text":"Definitely tastier than Mother's Dumplings down the street!  Loved their potato noodle salad and their steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup too. Price point is awesome and I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Agreed, perhaps the best dumpling house in Toronto. It's centrally located in Chinatown, just north of Spadina and Dundas.There's a variety of dumplings but we just got the pan fried and steamed pork and chives. The venue was large and nicely decorated with traditional Chinese themed paraphernalia. We were seated in about 10 minutes and service was overall a bit slow, but they were busy. Super cheap for us to eat here. I think the damage was about $25 with tax and tip. Come here for scrumptious dumplings. Pro tip: This place is best for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Best dumplings I've had in Toronto.  The wonton soup is fantastic as well, with fresh-made wontons exploding in your mouth with flavor. Service is a bit off, but it's Chinatown, Jake...so forget about it."}
{"text":"If you haven't witnessed slavery then you will witness slavery working at this place in modern society in Canada, in China town a newly renovated corner restaurant looking inviting and cozy with Chinese traditional decore and wall of fame celebrities coming to eat, you couldn't miss out the depressing life of young Chinese employees who are on edge every second being watched and yelled at by store owner. I went to the location 4 years ago and the blend food wasn't enough to bring me back, and I was more disturbed by the traumatizing scene I witnessed when the owner verbally abusing employee crossing the restaurant.

Since then I recently moved to near door the restaurant, last 20 months I had never gone to the location because I am just disgusted by it. However I came in again since a friend organized a meeting there. I was there on time however most of ppl bailed out last min. As me and other friend waiting, the owner was screaming at the employees, the poor girl was about to cry. Other Chinese ppl who do understand what she was saying just didn't want to get themselves in trouble because she's dead scary. Not long before she came to my table , I pretended I don't speak any Mandarin so she thought I am Canadian(I don't have accent) that she wasn't going to yell at me or her English sucks. So she went to an employee EXPLOADED on her screaming at her to come to us to kick us out. She was EXTREMELY HUSTLE. Her HUSBAND WAS EXTREMELY apologetic and appears scared of his wife just as everyone else does.

Listen to the store owner's language. She barely speak Enlgish but she is VERY ABUSIVE towards employees. The employees work under the table from China , probably just working to make a buck a too to supply the expansive living expanses in Canada since they pay and the owner--the woman in later 40s ride there ass to the extreme!!! She is contstantly screaming to young employees humiliating them in front of everyone in public, if you speak Mandarin you will understand what they are saying. Poor girls have tears in their eyes but cant stop working, and sucks up all the abuse n pushing on. 

The food is not so good. The dumplings are NOT as delicious as they look from window. Thick dumpling skin, you are chewing a lot of dough, and inner fillings are dry. Better dumpings at \"Chinese Traditional Bun\" at corner of Dundas/Spadina. 

Me and my friend finally left the restaurant she was still cursing fully crossing the restaurant(assume we didn't understand). Canadian people who don't undersand her please pay attention, she curses at anyone on her way constantly. 

I will give negative star if I could. As Chinese, I am disgusted watching Chinese people take advantage of Chinese people and pretend to be nice to Canadians or everyone else. It makes me sick in my stomach! I doubt they give fair tips to employees for how they treat them already! So give them less tips!"}
{"text":"You know that their dumplings are fresh because there's always 3 ladies at the storefront making them! You can't miss Dumpling House if you're walking on the west side of Spadina. The restaurant is small and crowded, so be prepared to wait and may accidentally bump into your table neighbours. Today, my friend and I ordered the shrimp and pork dumplings (12-15 pieces) and the pan fried pork and chives dumpling (12 pieces) - it was $20 in total, including tips. We had trouble finishing all those yummy, juicy dumplings! The steamed dumplings aren't much to look at as it's just steamed in water and are not served with anything. The pan fried dumplings are served on a plate where they are all attached by some sort of crunchy goodness. I usually dip my dumplings in malt vinegar with a bit of hot sauce. Be careful when you bite into the dumplings as the hot soup will squirt out! I'm salivating even as I'm writing this review and I can't wait to go back. I don't think I've ever tried their other dishes - they have fried rice, sweet and sour pork, etc. But since this is called Dumpling House, I'm sure that sticking to their large selection of dumplings is probably the safer bet."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after working a night shift and man did it hit the spot.
We got the Hot and Sour soup to help soothe our throats since we were both down with a cough, as well as pork and shrimp dumplings, both steamed and fried.
I'm not a fan of hot and sour soup because I've only ever had it at Mandarin before, but I really enjoyed the hot and sour soup here. It's perfectly seasoned with bits of bamboo, mushroom and tofu.
The pork and shrimp dumplings were great too, but I found myself leaning towards the fried ones. 
Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Let the MSG and grease fest begin!!!  And I do mean that in a good way.  The shanghai noodles with beef that I ordered came out piping hot!  A few minutes later when my pork dumplings came the noodles had cooled off enough that I could actually eat them.  For $5-8 per platter, you get a heaping amount of food; probably enough for 4 people to share.

The dumplings are all hand made in the restaurant, you can watch them being made from the window outside.  The staff were very friendly and courteous, though being in China town there is that slight language barrier.  

If you love a good, fresh dumpling this is the place to come."}
{"text":"Went here while on a tour of Canada and was disappointed. The food was bland and need seasoning. My dumplings were watery. Half way through the meal we realize the small cash only signs so I had to leave and get cash from an atm down the street. I came back and paid for the meal but was confused about how much change I received. The server wrote $45 but it looked like $42. The manager came over and proceeded to yell at me and my friend that it was $45. There was no need I just asked for clarification. I then said okay I understand which she then proceeded to yell 10% 10%. I said I already paid. She then says no for the tip. So I asked where is this written at? She says you are supposed to tip. So I explained a tip is for good service. I was then told they gave me good service. I said you chose to come yell at me when I only asked a question so no this wasn't good service and will not be tipping. She then yelled fine, don't come back! You know what I won't because clearly you have an issue with anyone asking about their bill or black people. Either way go to another restaurant in China town. Walk past this one quick."}
{"text":"I think I am spoiled by all these dumpling places uptown in Scarborough... 

Dumpling House Restaurant is really not up to the standard when compare to them..

Steamed Dumplings?? If it is supposed to be steamed why were they boiled??  (-0.5 star) The reason I love my dumpling steamed because this cooking method preserved all the taste inside the dumplings and when you bite into one, the soup inside just exposed and your mouth will be filled with flavours!

The pan fried ones were dripped with oil... my chopsticks were all slippery...

Green Onion pancakes ($3.99)  just tasted bland, oily and lack any green onion taste.. just doughy and oily!!

Price wise, it is more expensive than the dumpling places uptown, but I do understand that rent and operating cost is more downtown.. but at least work on making the dumplings better.. 

The owner was really nice and accommodating.. but I don't think I will be back here for dumplings!"}
{"text":"This is a cosy little restaurant in the heart of Dundas /Spadina Chinatown that serves up excellent dumplings hence the name of the joint.

We usually do the take out but decided to eat in this time.

We order 2 versions of their signature dumplings, the steamed and the fried ones. 
The flavors very tasty especially coupled with the chilli and black vinegar condiments.

The other dish we had was the beef brisket with noodles.
The meat was very tender and there was a lot of noodles, so much that even I could not finish it!

I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you want cheap dumplings, greasy noodles and fried rice, then this is your spot. They make the dumplings all day long to freeze (and you can buy them frozen). the pan fried dumplings are good with a shell of crispy batter surrounding the interlocked dumplings. But after a while, it doesn't matter which dumplings you get, they all taste the same."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the years simply because I love their pork and chive fried dumplings, although the filling is a bit sparse and usually pretty greasy. Not so bad for me because I love the fried lattice, and one order fills me up so it's still a cheap lunch at $6. Other dumpling flavours are good too, including the vegetarian options. I believe these are the best in Chinatown (& let me know if you know a better spot, I have tried many in attempts to top dumpling house), however I have had better in Koreatown and north of the core (of course.)

The service is above average for Chinatown, super fast; I think I caught a smile a couple times! The tables are close together and slightly greasy. There are mirrors and cool masks on the walls, so despite sitting close it doesn't feel too crowded. The tea is usually weak, but still welcomed. 

It's worth noting that the picture of the rat many years ago is still used as an example in the food handler's slideshow, ha!"}
{"text":"No no no no. How is this place rated so low??? Is it because you feel rushed out when you eat here? Is it the small space??? The food and the prices make up for these things! I've been here so many times and this place is definitely my go-to cheap eats spot. This isnt a place you sit and talk with friends. You eat and you go. Savour the delicious food as fast as you can and be on your way. :) this place gets super busy too. Always a line up outside to get in or waiting for takeout. So... That says something about how good this place is."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled. Maybe I had a bit to drink. And maybe I got unlucky and my friends stole all of the lamb dumplings from under my nose.

I thought these dumplings were pretty damn average.

These aren't bad dumplings. They're pretty tasty and superbly cheap. The ingredients are good, and but the steamed dumplings felt a bit too doughy. I vastly preferred the fried dumplings, but even then they were only pretty good.

Honestly, I can see myself eating frequently if I lived here, but it's nothing to write home about. Come here for solid, cheap dumplings."}
{"text":"Great dumplings. But don't try to go with the family as there's little space for strollers. In fact none. It's really loud too. But the food is great."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef noodles, the broth was good but the beef was dry. The noodles were okay. I ordered three kinds of dumplings and the green onion pancakes as well, I guess it was just too greasy for my taste. I will try the steamed dumplings next time, hopefully it will be better than the fried one."}
{"text":"Fast and cheap place for dumplings. If you just finished partying or work and need to satisfy your dumpling craving, this is the place. 

I avoid steamed food at all costs, so we got all the dumplings fried. They come to the table looking absolutely beautiful upside down. There's a satisfying amount of crispyness with a warm juicy finish. We also had the crystal noodle salad, so yummy! I dipped my dumplings in the leftover sauce from the salad.

I would recommend anything wit pork or shrimp here. the spinach and mushroom was fine but too little mushroom."}
{"text":"You can't leave this place without feeling like a stuffed duck.
I love this place. Their dumplings are made fresh to order and you can see the cluster of women working away at the storefront as they prepare them. The food is relatively cheap for the amount you're getting which is wonderful. However, you're definitely not paying for ambience because they have fire-engine table tops #nuffsaid.

My go to's are the fried dumplings (pick any 3) - chicken, beef, lamb, shrimp & veggie. Opt for any filling you'd like. The steamed dumplings are also good. I enjoy the house noodles with chicken, beef, and shrimp. The sauce on these things is magnificent and they get bonus points for thick noodles! Last but not least, their hot and sour soup is the best. You get so much soup (definitely enough for 2-3 people) and it's delicious. Just warning you - it has a kick that builds.

Cash only - so come prepared!"}
{"text":"Boiled pork and chive dumplings are solid but I've had better. The dumpling wrapper is deliciously chewy, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are very flavorful!! I got the pan fry pork and chive dumplings and it was really good. They have a lot of dumplings on their menu so definitely a wide selection to choose from. The restaurant is small but has many tables inside and it was packed when I got there. Definitely recommend to try their dumplings!"}
{"text":"The size of Toronto Chinatown makes it difficult to pick a restaurant, but I would highly recommend Dumpling House Restaurant purely for their variety of dumplings. For me, dumplings feel like home, and it's so valuable to be able to get a simple plate of steaming dumplings. The menu has an extensive variety of dumplings, but my boyfriend and I settled on the vegetarian and the chicken dumplings. Both had the chewy, hearty dough that I like in my dumplings. The fillings were very well-seasoned, but not too salty. We also ordered the house fried noodles, which were a little greasy for my taste, but overall a good rendition of the Cantonese dish. In terms of authenticity, I would put Dumpling House up there with some of the best that I've had outside of Asia!"}
{"text":"Actually 4.5 stars, but meh.

The restaurant itself, while small, was very clean and well-maintained, something of a surprise for Chinatown (I wasn't quite adventurous enough to venture into the toilet, though). The waiters, while brisk and not exactly friendly, were pleasant enough and very attentive (refilled your water without having to be asked, didn't need to wait to order) and answered our questions thoroughly. In addition, our waitress correctly separated and brought our party of 12 our bill when she noticed that we were just about done. Would be good service even if it wasn't Chinatown.

And of course, onto the wonderful, wonderful food. We had plates of both kinds of dumplings and two types of noodles, and they were delicious. We had in all 9 kinds of dumplings, and the fillings were all savoury and juicy and the skins were exactly the right thickness and chewiness. The noodles (we had the fried beef noodles and the zha-jiang noodles) were flavoured well enough and the noodles were all very chewy - yay!

Also, note that your dumplings are made to order - none of the frozen stuff! 

In addition, the price just cannot be beat - we ordered 12 dishes to feed 12, and our bill was less than $90 before tax - amazing!

Took half a star off because the food was quite oily and they only take cash."}
{"text":"I had read some reviews about this place and they were mostly positive, AND being that I am a new lover of dumplings I felt it deserved a try. Ordered the hot and sour soup, big enough for two to split, an order of dumplings, dirt cheap at $6 for 15, and the deep fried tofu, with the spicy sauce. Every single thing was perfect. Not too salty, thick soup, lots of mushrooms and tofu, the tofu was delicious, and the dumplings were some of the best I've had in Toronto. I highly recommend this place for the cheap and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Come here and take a dumpling. My second favorite next to Shan Dong in Oakland. I ate around 22 dumplings before going out for some drinks."}
{"text":"They prepare and cook their dumplings right in front of you. They make everything from scratch and it's just like homemade dumplings I used to have eat when I was little. We finished all the dumplings and gyoza, and left nothing behind."}
{"text":"Been there several times including before thy renovated.  Awesome each and every time."}
{"text":"We've been trying to find dumplings in Toronto, and something that is highly rated. My husband is a fan of steamed dumplings and I am more of a fried dumplings fan. 

We ordered hot and sour soup, steamed cabbage dumplings (which blew me away), pork fried dumplings (did not enjoy them at all), onion pancake (which wasn't cooked thoroughly) - and we were stuffed.

I would say that steamed dumplings are good here, yet I wouldn't order fried dumplings or pancakes as they were either undercooked or were cooked in too much oil. I do believe there were a lot of MSGs inside which made the food tasty, but you do need to drink more water after. But the price, oh wow, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Considering the price and the quality of the food here, I have to give this place a 5 star rating for what it is (a dumpling house in China Town). When I visited, there were 2 Asian women hand rolling dough and filling the dumplings in a window out front. I stopped here in the afternoon for a snack while visiting China Town. I ordered the pan fried dumplings. For 7.99, you get 12 pan fried dumplings (or 15 if you order steamed), and you get to choose any 3 types that they offer. I ordered the pork & chive, pork & shrimp, and lamb dumplings. All were delicious and you can tell that they were very fresh.  The pork and shrimp dumplings each had a whole shrimp inside. The lamb dumplings were probably my favorite. And I have to comment about another review that I read which complained that the pan fried dumplings were only crispy on the bottom... Umm, that is how they are supposed to be prepared! Pan fried dumpling means crispy bottom while the sides and top are soft.  You would have to order deep fried dumplings if you are expecting the wontons to be crispy all the way around. I highly recommend coming here if you're craving good dumplings!"}
{"text":"We were here on vacation and we decided to try this place after spending the morning in Chinatown.  We weren't impressed with the food or the service.  This is a very small restaurant with a few seating.  For the restroom, you have to meander downstairs.  Beside our table, there were only two other customers but the server seems to be in a rush.  The food was not really good.  We lived in overseas and also spent sometime in Los Angeles and Washington DC.  The beef noodle soup just didn't taste very good.  It was very salty.  The noodles were a little tough and chewy.  We had some friend dumplings.  It wasn't crispy.  It was very greasy and too doughy.  We weren't too impress with this place. 

It's definitely not the best we've had."}
{"text":"Came here as a suggestion of a friend who is in love with dumplings. I prefer other Asian cuisine but this was okay for the night. My fitness got the pork and shrimp dumplings and I got the spinach and mushrooms dumplings, steamed and fried respectively.  The food was pretty good. The friend rice was a bit bland. 

I will say that you get a nice size of dumplings for the price and the food comes out quickly. 

This place is greatly known for its dumplings."}
{"text":"Wife and I loved the dumplings.  Opted to get steamed dumplings rather then fried.  Very busy and very popular"}
{"text":"Fresh dumplings made right in front of you. 15 steamed dumplings for $7.99 or pan fried dumplings (I think there are 12 in one order) 
I had pork/cabbage and pork/chives. Both are delish. However the wrapper is way too doughy and thick. I would prefer it to be thinner.
Wonton soup was very ok for $4.99 comes with broth, mushroom and bamboo. Broth was decent but disappointed with the wonton itself. Again skin was too thick and not enough filling. Also the filling was pork (was expecting shrimps since it's wonton). I would prefer they charge more and put more filling in it. 

This is a good place for a quick bite. It gets quite busy during dinner and lunch rush. Not a place to mingle with friends. One thing to keep in mind for hot summer days, they don't have AC. We were sweating"}
{"text":"Worst dumplings I've ever had. I went to this place based on the excellent review from yelp. Otherwise, I wouldn't have considered trying after someone took a picture of the giant rat hanging inside their window couple years ago. Nobody seems to remember that anymore? However, as I was craving for dumplings, I wanted to give this a try. 

 I ordered the steam pork dumpings as I thought that would be a safe choice. The dumplings were extremely SALTY and I think they put a lot of soya sauce in the fillings. I was a bit concern they could have used the extra salt to cover the taste of unfresh meat.  

The service was not bad, the servers seemed nice but that couldn't save the bad dumplings."}
{"text":"Love this dumpling house. I don't find the food amazing or anything, but it is great place for cheap eats and dumplings.

You can order a lot of food to make a great complete meal. Shanghai noodles and egg drop soup for example. I have never seen a line up here yet, so that can be a plus when you just want to quickly be seated and eat. Staff are friendly here!"}
{"text":"Whenever I get homesick I pop into here. This is one of the best bang for your buck places in Chinatown hands  down. One thing I never understand (and hopefully someone can educate me), is why they call their non-fried dumplings \"steamed\". To me they're just \"boiled\". Regardless, you can't go wrong with either combination. 

Their dumplings are definitely the best in the city. After you've had dumplings where the skin/wrapping are hand rolled, you just can't go back to the \"pre-fab\" dumplings where the skin comes out of a machine."}
{"text":"Do not bring little kids who need high chair to this restaurant. They don't have any high chair in store. It was a disaster bringing a 19-month-old kid here. The environment is dirty. On the stairs to the restroom you can smell the toilet. The wraps of the dumplings are so thick. If you are from Asia you will definitely not think it as authentic dumplings. All in all, nothing to recommend."}
{"text":"I randomly walked into this restaurant after watching them make the dumplings from the window. 

I regret not getting the pan-fried dumplings. As seen in the pictures, they looked and smelled delicious when they were bringing others' pan-fried dumplings out.

This place is a hole-in-the-wall. There seemed to be a handful of Chinese people here (which is a very good sign). It was awesome to see such diverse people eating here. 

In an attempt to be healthy, I ordered steamed dumplings (12 pcs. for $5.99 CAD): shrimp & pork, minced beef, and pork and chives. All were tasty. 

I went in the middle of the afternoon (around 2:30 pm). They stayed busy all throughout. The staff were able to get people in and out of the restaurant. 

I saw some Chinese people dip the dumplings into a mix of the soy sauce and chile sauce. A little kick is a good thing, so I gave it a shot. After a couple bites, I couldn't get enough chile (hot) sauce. 

All in all: a nice hole-in-the-wall joint with reasonably priced dumplings. They were tasty. I would go back again... except I would want to go with two others so that we could order tons of dishes and share them together."}
{"text":"Hey, pretty good resto considering I've passed by here dozens of time and never considered actually eating here -- until today!  Good experience overall.  :)

Have the dumplings!  Made fresh on the premises, through the ample front window you'll see about two people standing long hours folding and binding dumplings with various fillings - anything from porc, shrimp, veg, or combo fillings.
You can have 15 Steamed dumplings for under $7/$6 or 12 fried dumplings for under $7/$6.  We had, as most others seemed to, the fried version of our dumplings.

Careful - portions are a bit crazy large.  Made to share.  Prices are Very good.  I'd stick with one dish per person or even two people.  Most items are flour-based, and we filled us up very quickly.  

Mom had the beef noodle (udon/fat noodles) dish.  It was too sweet, but you can tone that down with the vinegar condiment provided on the table.  I loved that they also offered hot mustard as well - not every Asian restaurant will decide to readily offer hot mustard, but I'm partial to it for certain items.

They were quick to offer free tea, and quick with coming around with any additional beverage ordered.

We also ordered a flour pancake (with green onions or chives?), $3.99.  Very flour based.  It was okay, but I wouldn't bother with ordering the pancake again.  

Decor was definitely nicer on the inside than the outside.  I marveled at how attractively the small restaurant was set up, given that the front of the restaurant looked like any other restaurant.  

Best parts of this restaurant?  The freshness of their dumplings, and other flour-based items made on the premises.  Also, their prices and serving portions... were very generous.  Service was quite nice and sincere.  We had 2-3 people in total serving us at our table - short waiting times, and they were all so kind - ex: when I said Thank you for bringing us something, the waitress actually gave a quick pause and Thanked me back (for saying Thanks in the first place?)

Not so great parts?
Hmm... Dumplings were good, but we weren't as bowled over with their noodle or rice dishes.  Or their pancake.  All edible, but nothing that stood out at all.
Also, I was facing the entrance door, and there was a line-up that kept hawking us as we chewed and swallowed our food.  Awkward.  Family told me to ignore that.  We weren't there especially long or short.  

I'd definitely go again... In time, depending on mood and opportunity."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday to showcase how delicious and cheap Chinatown can be and my friend and I both went for steamed dumplings to put up a fa√ßade of eating healthy and save some money (fried ones are more expensive). He got pork and green pepper, I stuck by my mixed vegetables.

They were good, kind of slimy and hard to grab with chopsticks. We both wished we had ordered the pan-fried ones.

We did split a small bowl of tomato egg drop soup, which is simply egg drop soup with little slices of tomato and parsley, and it was good. We weren't super hungry so the size was OK to share but I think if we had gotten a large, that would have been an acceptable size, too.

It was also my first time sitting down and noticed that Dumpling House has a distinct scent but it did not stop us from chowing down. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Decided to checkout this place a Sunday while strolling Toronto for the art weekend, the line was out the door and it wasn't a spacious restaurant for the waiting area at all!
We encountered an old lady who seemed to be owner, yapping around to the customers dining in and asking to leave tip. I have seen this kind of behaviors in Chicago Chinatown but come on, this is just too demanding.
 Talk about customer service, eh?

We ordered the infamous shrimp and pork fried dumplings, which we were in the line for at least  30 mins and finally got the food after an hour and thirty mins! I told my husband that this food better be worth it and good!!!

We went back the next day since we were meeting some frds in Chinatown and they decided to grab lunch nearby.  Somehow we decided to grab this as a take out for the dumplings as well!
 Interestingly, the old lady who was yapping for tips yesterday turned out to be super nice today to everyone. 


The quality of the food is really great since the dumplings are made to order and they are made right in front of you.  I wished they could expand more and have better customer service. Then, they'll be five stars."}
{"text":"WORST restaurant experience ever. The female owner of the restaurant flipped out at a couple for cancelling an order. She made a scene in front of the entire restaurant, and verbally assault the couple in Chinese. She proceeded to humiliate the couple and herself for another 10 minutes, then insisted on them paying for their canceled meal. As they were leaving, she cursed and ran after them as they didn't pay for their canceled meal. The husband of the restaurant had to physically stop her. This is unacceptable behaviour and I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"when you're sad and lazy and just want freakin fresh dumplings, come here. nothing exciting but hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Almost as good as my mom's home made dumplings, the Dumpling house is an easy and yummy spot for a quick bite to satisfy most of your Chinese dumpling cravings!

The owner is incredibly nice, although a few if the staff do not speak enough English to even answer simple questions. While I usually eat them boiled at home I found the wrapper from the steamed ones to be a bit thick. The pan fried ones were amazing!!! We got beef pan fried and pork/chives boiled. I will definitely come back to try a few more. All in all, a great spot."}
{"text":"i was looking very forward to eating at this establishment with a group of friends. 
they ended up running out of food earlier in the day *we showed up at 8pm* 
was not impressed...don't run a restaurant if you cannot keep ample stock. 
didn't even sit down, just left"}
{"text":"Portions are large, so it works out to be very very cheap! We ordered a mix of both the fried and boiled dumplings - all of them were great, but for some it was hard to distinguish the fillings, probably our fault for ordering similar things. The hot & sour soup and the scallion pancake were also super yums!

Also, friendly reminder that it is CASH ONLY - from what I could see there really wasn't any indication of this before being seated other than seeing that everyone was paying in cash & not seeing a machine near the register!!!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here for dinner, ordered a plate of large lamb dumplings and kungpao chicken for a party of two. I love lamb dumplings,  so I was excited for dinner.

Unfortunately, the lamb dumplings barely had a hint of lamb at all. It was green in texture and I had to ask the waiter whether there was in fact, lamb inside the dumplings. The waiter said that other people had asked about these dumplings before and that they were supposed to be like this. So stay away from these if you actually want lamb - I couldn't taste any and was actually wondering if I had just gotten ripped off.

The kungpao chicken was tastier, but I was annoyed at the charge for white rice (more than a dollar). Chinese restaurants should not be charging for white rice with an order of an entree."}
{"text":"Great place ! The food came out quick and hot . The fried dumplings are next level . We ordered the fried shrimp and veg dumplings and they were served to us as one delicious fried mass. We also order veg fried rice , general tso chicken, and the veg fried noodle . Everything was delicious and had great flavor . The chicken was crispy but saucy . I loved everything ! 

To top it off, the owner took our American cash in this \"cash only\" restaurant. Even though they disclaimed that they couldn't give us change back, they were able to in the end . Great service :)"}
{"text":"Steamed and pan friend dumplings were alright. Nothing to drool over about. They should get new silverware. You would see what I mean by the photo of the cup.  And they gave us our bill while we were still eating. Not good. We were only there for about 30 mins."}
{"text":"The owner is really really rude to her staff and customers. And as a Chinese, the food tastes very bad. I won't go there and won't suggest people go there."}
{"text":"Steamed dumplings are amazing.
Fried dumplings are very good as well.
There are veggie dumplings, seafood dumplings and meat dumplings as well.
Just tried the dumplings and the veggie rice, the veggie rice was also good.
The place is cool, service is fast and good.
I consider it cheap.
If you go to Toronto and fancy dumplings, this is a must."}
