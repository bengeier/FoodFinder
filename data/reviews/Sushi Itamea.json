{"text":"Les meilleurs sushis du quartier à prix raisonnable et en plus on peut y apporter son vin. C'est toujours plein, vaut mieux réserver si vous y allez la fin de semaine. Service sympathique,  la table d'hôte du soir est un super bon deal. En plus ils livrent à domicile! Leurs soupes sont pas mal aussi."}
{"text":"We walked by a few times, and last night we felt like trying something asian... so naturally we went in.  The place has very nice decor, and the chef was in uniform!!! I thought to myself is this some serious chef? or is he just posing? Hahaha. I won't answer that question but I'm pretty sure you can guess after you read my review...  Let me just say, The sushi menu is just insane!!! there are something like 190 varieties of sushi, sashimi, maki and whatnot... seriously it's just plain confusing .  I feel like  a lot of the ingredients are repeated, and frankly it takes me too long to choose...  We had a few maki rolls, one with eel, one with tuna and crab stick, one with salmon, some veggie tempura, fish grilled with miso sauce, and octopus salad.  The octopus salad looked nice but the dressing was lacking, and too much green and not so much meat. The fish was well cooked and flaky, but the miso was a bit salty. It was served with rice, cucumbers, greens, and more salty miso sauce on the side...  The sushi rolls were decent, back in the day, spicy mayo was a nice touch but nowadays it's everywhere and used in too many rolls. The eel roll had see weed in it, which was different, except I'm not sure I liked it. All in all, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either...  One mistake I made was not ordering the items on the menu that was marked specialty, maybe that would have been different, maybe next time...  The menu is so extensive, I'm going to have to come back before I can make up my mind about this place. Some of the stuff looked interesting to try, but sometimes the description looks better than the thing itself, we'll see."}
{"text":"Les. meilleurs du quartier! Nous y mangeons chaque semaine et ne sommes jamais déçus, ce qui arrive lorsqu'il nous prends l'envie d'aller voir ailleurs!"}
{"text":"Been a long time customer here, back when it was called Yoy. I love their sushis. They taste as a sushi should, amazing and fresh. My favourites are the lobster and the quebec ones. The chef tends to cheap out on you on the combos and you have to expect to wait about an hour for the delivery. But I will definetely order from them in the future."}
{"text":"les sushi sont très bons !!!  mais par contre éviter les plats chinois, il y a meilleur ailleurs !"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place because of Just Eat. I was expecting just another delivered maki and futomaki. But this place, let me tell you, was an instant hit when i tasted the freshness of their rice and ingredients.  Will definitely swing by if im the area."}
{"text":"Vraiment de très bons Sushi!!! Les pizzas Sushi sont un délice!! Ça ne se compare vraiment pas aux autres chaînes de restaurant a de Sushi!! Livraison rapide!! Et bon prix !!"}
{"text":"It was Sunday night and I didn't feel like cooking. Since I was craving sushi I decided to peruse Just Eat and Foodora for some interesting options. I was impressed that Itamea delivered downtown. I mean, some dt adjacent neighbourhoods don't even deliver to us and this restaurant is all the way in Beaubien! Kudos to them.  While it's well-rated on Yelp, Facebook and Google reviews are terrible. Angry reviewers mostly complained about the service and long delivery time, so I was mentally ready to wait at least 2 hours. I was pleasantly surprised when the delivery arrived after only one hour (which is actually not fast, I know).   I was really satisfied with my order. I tried the spicy salmon, the spicy scallop, Volcano, Golden Gate and Special Itamea makis. There were generous amounts of fish and avocado- most sushi restaurants will try to cheap out by loading up on tempura, but not here.   Only complaint was that one of the quail eggs on my Rising Sun nigiri broke during delivery. They should put the quail eggs separately in a small plastic container to avoid this problem. Overall though, for delivery on a Sunday night, it really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi place, the best there is in the neighborhood. The Dragon is amazing and everything is always fresh and tasty. Yes, it can take some time to get your order but that's how you know your food is fresh. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellents makis et sushis. Les poissons étaient frais et tendres, un vrai régal ! Le tout bien présenté et assez peu onéreux (29 dollars tx+tips la table d'hôte avec soupe et la totale sushi/makis).  Seul bémol : il ne faut pas être affamé le service est looooooong."}
