{"text":"Took my sister here to confirm its authenticity. U need to go spicy with these noodles. Otherwise u might as well not try them. Little bit pricey for d portion size but once a while should b ok. Wil go back next time with d family."}
{"text":"Noodles are great. The heat in the dish I had was just amazing. All around great comfort food for a cold day. I have this place 5 stars because it is so reasonably priced compared to all other places in Calgary.  For example, a can of pop cost 1.50, and you get a large bowl full of hand pulled noodles for 11 bucks."}
{"text":"Good 'hungsao niew lo mien' (spicey beef noodle soup). As I know a few Taiwanese benchmarks from 15 years ago to the present, and after a 2nd visit, I'd only rate this soup at 3.5.

The hand-pulled noodles. 
Their consistency and quality is decent and bring a solid base to accompany a tasty broth that on the first pass housed somewhat strong-layered accents. But at home and after the 2nd visit, it's plain that they are pasty, and not good enough to eat when most of them dominated the dish on the return visit. Not sure why, but the larger wide noodles in our stir-fried dish were much better (likely store bought).
 
The broth. 
On the 2nd visit, just not as good. Not sure why, but was more bland even after adding some red sauce. Green onions are added, and as the broth is not too hot, one can add flavour and heat from their condiments to try suiting one's palate.

The meat. 
The sated & marinated small beef chunks are very tasty, and, when get them, the thin beef strips add protein and iron. But on the 2nd visit, the latter were missing. Not sure why. 
My wife's stir-fried chicken with vegetables was well-flavoured, and the wide noodles tasted better than the hand-pulled (2nd visit). As the portions are big, take home.

Sides.
When a couple of mild-tasting 'lu dan' (soy-sauced eggs) are added, fairly yummy.
The seaweed salad was authentic, and worth the couple bucks.
The slightly flavoured cabbage was good, but not a standout. 

This restaurant hearkens back to Asian night market fare with the large cauldrons for heating the noodles and making the broths. Eat in their relatively plain dining area and watch the noodle maker pull and press and presto, or take your meal home. Caution: at home re-heat the noodles in the microwave to prevent over-boiling them into mush.

As well, one can order a substantial Chinese beef stew or two, other soups, noodle-based salads, and tea. If these match the stir fry, worth  returning.

Ah, but check out Calan for yourself. Anyone stuck on true Chinese flavours will be somewhat pleased. But after the 2nd visit, I am mixed and much less inclined to return..."}
{"text":"Very good. My wife and I like this place. Very authentic Chinese northwestern hand stretched noodles."}
{"text":"Speaking as someone who cannot tolerate spice, I have to say I really enjoyed my bowl of noodles in the clear broth! The noodles were the perfect chewiness, the broth was really flavorful and hey, if you want that spicy sauce, they will add some for you! I was also amazed at how the side order of beef shank was nicely tender with good flavor.

The only thing I didn't quite like was the service of the one guy... he seems grumpy and disconnected (I've been there twice and he's the same both times).  And why does he automatically start speaking Mandarin with each and every customer?"}
{"text":"Anyone In Calgary area and needing a warm hot noodles soup, you must come in to try this place. It's a hidden gem in Calgary with spicy beef noodles soup.
What makes their noodles soup so special? The noodles are made fresh to order , and made from hand pull from the chef itself. Noodles are chewy, soft and delicious. A must must try!!!"}
{"text":"I first noticed Calan Beef Noodle from the line-up around the block on its opening day. That definitely sparked curiosity in me, not enough to stop and join the queue but enough to suggest that I try it. The boast on the outside sign is that they've been making \"Traditional Lan Zhou Hand pulled noodles\" since 1915. I stopped in last night around 7:45 p.m. They close at 8:30 p.m. but a couple of tables were occupied. It's a limited menu of 4 noodle bowls and a choice from 4 types of noodle based on how you like your noodles, whether round and skinny or thick or flat and narrow or wide. You can have beef noodle soup, soup with soy bean paste and noodle with minced beef or noddles with just vegetables. That's basically the extent of the menu and you also have some side dishes such as tea-soaked egg and a couple of other items but most of them were sold out by the time I looked at the table. The chef is behind a glass panel so you can watch the noodles being pulled and then cooked and you can select the side dishes you want from the table beside the noodle table. I had the beef noodle soup and it definitely had a beefy flavour. The noodles were pretty good too but I think the dish would have tasted better had I opted for the flat and narrow noodles. I ordered the wide and they were about 3/4\" in width. Texture matters and I think the narrower noodles would have suited this dish better. They have NO TAKE OUT. There is a small lot shared with about 5 or 6 other businesses so depending on time of day it might be busy. I stopped in for lunch today (friday) and that's how I found out there is no take-out and also found parking easily. The noodles could have been a little more al dente. Service was ok, not overly friendly but as I sat eating last night none of the people there (all wearing restaurant uniforms) interacted with much emotion or joy. They seemed very inscrutably chinese, not offering information but happy to answer questions. My bowl of noodles was around $11.50 but it was tasty and very filling without any side dishes."}
{"text":"When I heard that this place served hand-pulled noodles, I knew they had to take my money. The first time I tried it was the beef brisket noodle soup with flat, thin noodles. The first bite was delicious and the noodles were certainly my favourite but that's it--just noodles. The tiny nuggets of brisket they included was disappointing and the broth didn't have any depth and was extremely salty. This experience was two months ago and against my better judgment I decided to give it a second chance. I chose a different noodle soup, a simple beef broth noodle soup with spicy pickled mustard greens and the noodles were flat and wide. I personally don't recommend the flat and wide noodles in the noodle soup, maybe different it was the fried version, but in this case it became too heavy. The broth again was disappointing, barely spicy. The pickled mustard greens were yummy...for the small amount that was given. Overall, it has a nice appeal but certainly has many areas in need of improvement."}
{"text":"Went in the early afternoon and was not very busy. The best part about this place? The noodles are made right in front of my eyes!!!!! A few choices for the thickness, too. Downside, I found this place a bit on the pricey side since the bowl was full of noodles but not many pieces of beef or other garnish. Soup tastes alright. Simple menu but quite versatile. They prefer cash or debit. Have to pay first after ordering. It's semi-fast food style that I'm not fully used to. In addition, I'd prefer to give the tips post my meal. Giving tips before the meal feels as if the price of the noodle went up automatically. Overall not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Before my trip back to Vancouver, my boyfriend took me to Calan Beef Noodle Restaurant in North part of Calgary. We had an early dinner at this place. Calan Beef Noodle was the first handmade noodle Restaurant in Calgary. It's a small Chinese Restaurant. There are no many tables in this restaurant. We arrived the restaurant around 4:30. This place was very full. We had to wait for while to get a table.

After we sat down, we began to order our food. My boyfriend had HAND-PULLED NOODLES IN BEEF SOUP, which is $10.99. I ordered CALAN SPECIAL POTATO NOODLE IN SPICY SAUCE, which is the same price as the beef soup noodles $10.99. In addition, I also ordered Egg and Beef dish sides.  After we ordered all the food, we had to wait for 10 - 15 mins for our food. Finally, our food came out the kitchen. They were all well cooked and fresh. Each noodle bowl has its own flavors. The noodles tasted very delicious and fresh. Both of noodle bowls were in huge portions, which were totally worth the prices. We had very great time there. When we finished our meal, we could just leave the empty bowls on the table. The servers gotta clean up for us. In summary, we had a great experience in Calan Noodle."}
{"text":"Love the hand made noodles with beef brisket at Calan Beef Noodle!   The broth is so rich and tasty.  Watching the guy make the noodles was cool!  After the noodles were made, he immediately cooked them.  Also, ordered the beef tendon and the tea egg.  All so tasty!  A must is the chilli oil to add to your meals.  Also, got the 2 plater of vege - seaweed salad and pickled cabbage.  All good!  To end the meal, the special fragrant tea was so pretty to look at and so nice and sweet.  The special tea has little rosebuds, tea leaves, longans, red dates, & goji berries.  

This is a order and pick up your food restaurant.  The restaurant is pretty small. Parking is very limited in a strip mall opposite Lina's Italian Market.

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My first Lan Zhou hand-pulled noodle experience was in New York's Chinatown a couple years ago and I was sold. You can imagine my anticipation when I found out that YYC has opened up their first hand-pulled noodle restaurant. Calan Beef Noodle's small store front (~seats about 25 people) provides a casual fast food style experience where you go up to the cashier to order and pay, and then pick up your dish yourself when they call out your order number. I'm a little unsure if you seat yourself, because when we arrived (we were a party of 4), all the tables were occupied. One of the employees asked how many we had and told us to wait for a larger table to empty out. I have a feeling that you can freely seat yourself if vacant tables are available at arrival. When you are finished with your meal, you just leave your emptied out bowls and utensils as is and the employees will cleanup for you.

I ordered the #2 (hand pulled noodle in beef soup with pickled sour mustard) and made it a combo for $15.99 (includes a plate of simmered beef tendon and tea flavoured boiled egg), and opted for the flat and wide noodles. It was a flavourful and acceptable level of spice for the broth. However the broth is super oily due to the spice (chili oil included?) they use, so you will for sure be downing litres of water afterwards. I didn't finish the broth due to the oiliness, however my friend was able to lick his bowl clean (it was that good, but my conscious didn't allow me to do so).

You can watch as your noodles are pulled in front of you. Everything was done super quickly, and we got our lunch in no time. I loved the texture of the noodle and how dense it tastes. The flat and wide noodle did however make it difficult to eat as it kept slipping and sliding off my chopsticks (warning: wear a dark shirt to avoid soup splatters), however it was well worth it. I think next time I will try the thick noodles instead. I love my noodles and spaghetti with more texture and surface area, so that I know I am eating it. They give you more than enough noodles, and this was evident by the food coma we all felt after our meal. The portion of meat in the soup noodle was not abundant, however I had no problem with that since I am more of a carb fan than a meat fan, but I can see that being an issue for those who prefer to indulge in meat over carbs. The beef tendon didn't do much for me, not much flavour so I wouldn't order again. The tea flavoured boiled egg was so-so, the tea flavour wasn't very strong but I would potentially order the egg again (since I love eggs) separately without making my meal a combo.

Also, they have a stamp card where if you accumulate 10 bowls you can get one for free, so make sure to ask for one in case they forget to offer you the card.

I will definitely return again. There are a few more items on their menu that I am looking forward to trying out. Overall this place makes for a great quick and cheap meal."}
{"text":"I don't know whether it's a good or bad sign that Calan Beef Noodle was the highlight of my (albeit brief) trip to Calgary/Banff. Granted, a snow storm put a lot of activities on the back-burner for us, but a big bowl of hand-pulled noodles hit the spot better than anything we could have dreamed. This place isn't anything fancy, but DANG is it good."}
{"text":"The noodle was great but the service was confusing. When I fist came in, the cashier told me to sit down at the table and informed me that the menu is on the screen. I sat there, thought that she would come and take my order. Then nobody came to my table so I asked here if I have to order and pay at the cashier and she said yes!!! At least let me know what I have to do. Don't assume that I know everything since it was my first time. And by the way, they kept speaking Chinese to me even though I told them I'm not. The noodle deserves my 3 stars. Not the service"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for dinner at this Taiwanese noodle house to try out.  It's a little restaurant in a strip mall across from the Italian place Lina's on centre street.  The parking is tight on a busy day if you have a large vehicle.  We parked on the side street around the corner.  I enjoyed watching the workers make the fresh noodles behind the glass window work area... kneading the dough, swinging it as the formed and cut specific sized noodles for your order.  Kinda cool to watch !  I ordered the # 7 brisket soup and my husband got the stir fried noodle dish.  You can get a combo with your order for a couple more dollars for a piece of tendon & a soya egg which we passed... Normally for combo , we are used to a drink and side dish for combo .  You can ask for various spicy or non spicy taste levels.  We asked for med spice but we aren't used to hot spicy foods and found this was still too hot and had to ask for water!  They do have a water dispenser by the pop fridge to help yourself with glasses next to it.  I was a bit disappointed that my brisket soup had small sized chunks of meat in it about the size of a nickle and very little veggies.  I was expecting some chunks of broccoli or bok Choy or something more than few sizes of radish or thin pieces of turnip ... not sure what was in my soup .  My husband ate his noodle dish but not used to spicy level.  This place is good if you like spicy!
I got the sweet tea and it come in a covered tea bowl with various dried fruit in hot water... goji berri, dried Logan berry, rose buds,... and a thermos of extra hot water to enjoy several cups more.  It was pretty and I enjoyed my tea. A friend had a noodle soup and asked for non spicy and was disappointed once she ate the few pieces of veggies & meat, she was left with a bowl of white noodles with no flavoured broth... 
this is a small restaurant for maybe around 15 to 20 people.  Workers and owners were nice but some did not speak much English.  You may like this if you like authentic Taiwanese soups or noodles with spice. Place was clean inside."}
{"text":"Happened to be shopping at Lina's and noticed this place across the street. At 12:50pm, not an empty seat in the place! A man behind a glass panel was twisting hand made noodles which was so fascinating to watch!  This place is tiny and very makes no more than a dozen items. 

I ordered #7- noodles with braised beef. The soup was spicy and you can choose the shape of your noodles. Thin, thick, flat, round. Noodle texture was deliciously chewy and the broth was very flavourful without being too salty - my one pet peeve!  There's additional hot sauce on the tables if you need more heat. I would have liked a few extra pieces of beef in my soup but other than that, it was a filling and body warming bowl of comfort.  I'd like to go back to try the pan fried noodles and a tea egg."}
{"text":"I love love love the authentic Lanzhou Beef Noodles here. Great portion, fair price, and yummy noodles!"}
{"text":"Visiting this hand made noodle place for twice, i don't think i will go back again. Not that it's bad, just ... i think it's just okay. Plus i don't really eat spicy stuffs unless they're really really good. 

Food court style - order food, pick a table then go grab your order when it's ready. And while u are waiting, you could see them making your noodle. But the noodle size is not very consistent, and it's kinda salty for me."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles, or \"lamian\", has zero connection to hongshao niurou mian. So disregard anything you read here about it being compared to. Separate regions, separate dishes. Lamian, has a long and cultured history, while the Taiwanese beef brisket noodle it is being compare to is barely 3 decades old. Like ramen, beef brisket noodle is inspired by the century old lamian. Ramen in kanji is in fact the same characters as lamian. 

History put aside, Calan is so named to attract visitors, prior to this, there was only one other shops offering lamian, a food court stall in Chinatown. It merely advertised as Lanzhou Lamian, and it did horribly business wise. People in the know went, but it's was never hugely popular. So I don't blame Calan Beef Noodle trademarking its business as such. 

Just know that this small Asian fast food format hole in the wall is legit. I've only had better lamian in New York. 5 stars.

{"text":"My favourite hand pulled noodle shop. Great selection of various noodle dishes. Noodles are not too soft, not too hard, just right."}
