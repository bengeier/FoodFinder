{"text":"Just posting this, but ate here a couple weeks ago. Great food and service. Enjoyed the jerk chicken. Only ordered the quarter chicken, big mistake, should have ordered larger portion, it is that good. The banana salad dressing was the best."}
{"text":"Gourmet Caribbean food. My Oxtail was super tender and every thing on the plate was perfect from the baby carrots to the fresh sprouts and baby parsley(Ok so I was impressed with the incredibly fresh and interesting produce which I don't usually see in Vegas). My party also ordered curry shrimp (caliente and flavorful) and Akee which was well executed also.  Even my salad dressing was freshly made.  The Chef Eva came out and she was not only sweet, but also a gracious host. I had a fantastic time. She explained that this was a tasting menu for a new location closer to the strip, so I hope it works out!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Island Fusion Las Vegas and the food and service were excellent. The presentation, food and drinks were top notch. Ms. Eva, the chef and owner, gave one of the best service we have had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hi there all you jerk lovers. I have been to quite a few Jamaican restaurants and always try the jerk. I was expecting good jerk but got the BEST jerk I have ever eaten. The chicken was cooked on an outdoor grill and the spices were excellent.  The owner Eva is a true Jamaican chef and a very sweet person.

I just made this place my goto for Jerk!

{"text":"I dined here last evening about 6:00 PM.  I actually drove by once before stopping because it didn't look like anyone was there.  Sure enough, I was the lone customer.

I just sat at the bar and chatted with the friendly gal behind the bar.  I ordered the jerk pork with fried plantains and rice & peas.  I also had a Modelo and a Victoria while at the bar.

The salad came out and it was beautiful!  Somebody back there knows what they're doing, that's for sure.  I don't remember what kind of dressing I chose, but it was outstanding.

It took a bit for the entree to come out, but it was certainly worth the wait.  As with the salad, everything on the plate looked beautiful.  The bartender asked if I wanted some habanero salsa to put on the pork.  Yes, please.  She brought a very small container with a very small amount of sauce.  Boo!  I asked for more and got another small container...oh well.

This was light years better than any Caribbean food I've ever had.  

The owner/cook came out and asked how everything was, which was nice.

I'm a bit concerned whether this place will be here when I come back to Vegas.  It looks like they have a pretty successful catering operation going out of this location, so hopefully they'll keep the restaurant going as well.

You should try it!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The service, the food, the atmosphere. It's a real gem. It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's well worth going in. The chef came by and asked about the food. The waiter was informative. Everyone was so cheerful and pleasant. I will definitely be going back soon. We got some coupons from them too!! The food was succulent and flavorful and I don't think you can go wrong with anything your order. The entree is a wait but it is well worth it. They take their time to put love into the food and you can tell."}
{"text":"I thought it was very good! We went for lunch and the place was very neat, clean and beautiful! The service was excellent (although we were the only ones in there) and the owner came out and personally asked us how our food was and if we needed anything else, loved that!! I had the chicken lettuce wraps and it was sooo yummy, my husband had the oxtails which were allllright, and he also had the jerk chicken which was very good and definitely worth getting again! I would recommend anyone to try out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"When was the last time a random stop for \"just something to eat\" turned into an amazing food experience for you?

Been a while? Yea, me too.

So, I am driving home after a long day, thinking I am in no mood to make dinner and not sure if I am up to eating out. Of course, the thought of fast food always gives me the heebie jeebies, so where do I go from here?

Just as I was feeling the true folly of my dilemma, I passed this place with a \"Now Open\" sign called Island Fusion.

Boy am I glad I did.

I'll be honest, I usually think of jerk chicken as a Styrofoam box kind of meal, but I am genuinely impressed with what I saw - and I'll give you a little secret, I am more impressed with what I tasted.

To start was a simple salad, but presented beautifully. What really blew me away was the banana dressing - holy fruitcakes batman, that stuff is the bomb. The chef uses nothing but fresh, organic ingredients in everything she makes, which I think is something Vegas needs desperately in its restaurant scene.

The main dish was the jerk pork. At this point I will be honest with you, as I mentioned, my past experience with jerk chicken has left me wanting, so I chose the pork instead. First off, the presentation was incredible (please take a look at the pictures). On top of that, the pork was perfectly succulent and mind-blowingly flavorful.

I also have to tell you that the fried plantains were just as revolutionary amazing as everything else. 

On top of all this amazing food, they have a large variety of fresh squeezed juice mixes, I highly recommend the \"Jamaican Me Crazy Punch\".

The place is still young, and they have some work to do on a few aspects here and there, but it is nothing that should distract from the amazing food. I have a lot of hope for this place, I encourage you to try it out and I encourage them to keep innovating.

I definitely recommend giving this place a try, I know they are going to get even better with time."}
{"text":"Wow! I saw this place on the news the other day and decided to give it a try. 

George our waiter was polite attentive and professional. 

We ordered the jerk chicken and the oxtail. 
The chicken had a perfect amount of heat. The flavors were powerful but unlike most jerk chicken I have had it wasn't salty. The meat was juicy and the skin was crispy perfect. Excellent! 

The oxtail was delicious. It didn't have quite the flavor explosion like the jerk chicken but it was delicious. 

The only negative was how you could hear someone in the kitchen consistently complaining to the waiter. You waiter is the face of your business and is doing a great job. Be nice to him."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the way Island Fusion prepares their food, it always looks to good to eat. All of the great flavors, I can't get enough of. Amazing food should be their motto!"}
{"text":"We had dinner yesterday and I didn't have my phone or I would have taken some mighty tasty pictures.  The food is divinely delicious...clean and fresh...and has a great atmosphere.  I was expecting the meat to be super salty but it was so tasty and flavor galore that I ordered some to go as well. 

The juices are delicious and I have found a new spot to eat.  This area has become restaurant row with some great chefs and menus!!!!"}
