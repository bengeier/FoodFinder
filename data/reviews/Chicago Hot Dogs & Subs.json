{"text":"A nice little hidden gem. A bit pricey, but the food is worth it. A classic diner layout in the middle of such glitz and glamour is a nice twist. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"We stopped in Roxy's Diner on our way out of Vegas and it was just what we needed. Decent breakfast food without breaking the bank. After our night in the Bellagio and dinner at Paris, we needed something decent off the Strip. Roxy's delivered.I had the Tomato Caprese Benedict and Lisa had the California Omelette, complete with Avocado. Service was good until it came time to get the check; that took a little while.Overall, we recommend Roxy's when looking for breakfast in Vegas. Even though it is located in the Stratosphere (a not so great casino), the free parking and quality/price ratio make it a good bet. (so to speak)."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. Especially since we all had post-club munchies. The hot dog itself tasted delicious but it was falsely advertised! It was advertised with the hotdog falling off of the bun but when I got it, not only was it tiny but the hotdog was WITHIN the bun. WITHIN."}
{"text":"Oh my where do I start. The prices are to high for what you get. I got a turkey Reuben it had one slice of turkey no cheese and where was the sour kraut. 8.99 you get nothing with it. The food was tasteless. Go across the way and go to Mcdonalds.."}
{"text":"Stay clear of this place. Ordered chicken and waffles for 10 dollars. The order was literally one fried piece of chicken and two ego waffles. Save yourself the money and avoid."}
{"text":"This place manages to be both a complete ripoff, while also being completely unsatisfying in just about every conceivable way.  Allow me to explain. We stopped by here after seeing the Carvery 108 on Yelp! and wanted to give it a try. Apparently, you need to either be a hotel guest or pay the additional fee for the Tower Ride in order to even access this place. Um, what genius conceived of a business with such a limited customer potential??  Needless to say, we decided against that. We were still hungry and wanted to grab a quick bite before needing to return to another casino to participate in a slot tournament. That's when we saw this place and decided to give it a shot.   Seriously, disappointing on every level imaginable.   - Dining area is very small and cramped. About 7-8 tables shoved up against the wall with some beverage coolers. - Dirty tables. There's only like 7 or 8 of them. Wipe them down! - No prices marked anywhere. Had to ask for a menu with prices. - The girl was nice but seemed moderately confused. About 5 minutes after placing our order and sitting down, the girl asked us for our copy of our receipt because she could not remembered what we ordered. Seriously??!? - When we got the food it was bland, puny, and pathetic. The Philly Cheese Steak was bland with no flavor. That omelette was a joke! That thing was tiny and served on a small paper plate! The toast was plain and tasted like stale bread and was served with a tab of wrapped butter. The hash browns evoked images of McDonalds.  - This fine experience costed us $27.96. They should be wearing masks. Shameless f*cking crooks. I still can't believe I just paid $30 for that shit show.  I can't see any sober, rational person coming to this place intentionally. Even if you find yourself wandering about the Stratosphere and come across this place, keep walking. Truly, truly terrible.  I knew I should have tried the Mexican Restaurant next to this place...  1 star."}
{"text":"Ordered Philly cheesesteak and noticed no prices were labeled anywhere until you find out your total ... 11 bucks for small philly, it was alright but nothing special. Would pay 4 bucks for what I got... Rip off but I guess it comes with the territory"}
{"text":"Don't even think about eating at this restaurant. I made the mistake of not reading Yelp before I ate here and I ended up regretting it.  First off, there are entirely too many choices on the strip to even look in the direction of this place. I ended up here because we were in a hurry and didn't take the time to find an establishment worthy of our time and money.  I ordered a grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese was made with a sandwich maker and not on a grill. The bread was thin and the sandwich had to be one of the smallest ones I have EVER seen. The fries more than likely came from a bag stored in the freezer.  My sister had the hotdog. She didn't like it and therefore only ate half of it. As someone else mentioned, there are no prices on the menu so you have no idea what you are being charged. We ended up being charged nearly $20. TOTAL RIPOFF.  Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Stay away from a place that doesn't have prices. Total rip off. $18 for a cold hotdog and soggy fries. Did I mention that there are no prices on the menu. Please beware."}
{"text":"If you're smart enough to check Yelp before eating here...keep walking. Not worth $6.99 for this dog. And look at my picture for the pathetic serving of onion rings for the same price. They can't all be winners in Vegas, this one is a bust."}
{"text":"I love me a good Chicago dog, so when I saw that this place was located in our hotel, I knew I'd have to visit.  So, one night after a bit of video poker, I decided it would be the perfect time to indulge.  Of course, I ordered the Chicago dog while the Mr went with the Texas dog, which was basically a chili cheese dog topped with pickled jalapenos.  So...the worst Chicago dog I've ever had.  Yep. I mean, I suppose they tried but it didn't even have the poppy seed bun or the fluorescent green relish.  Come on now.  If this review was based solely on that, they probably would only deserve one star.  However, service was quick and friendly, and while the Texas dog wasn't anything to rave over, at least it had some flavor and was a tad bit better than mine was.  I'd suggest skipping it unless you're stumbling across the corridor because you had one too many at Fat Tuesday.  In that case, they should serve you well."}
{"text":"Good place to eat if you're just chilling around the stratosphere, they don't list their pricing anywhere so be prepared for that. We got a hot dog, the corn beef Reuben, and fried cheese and our total came to around 35$. We did eat here in the afternoon on a Tuesday so it wasn't busy which was nice. I'd recommend if you were looking for something decent tasting and quick"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while staying at the Stratosphere. Great customer service and the food was delicious. Surprisingly there were more people eating at Roxy's Diner but after eating there the day before, we were much more satisfied with this place. Best mozzarella sticks ever!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced crap. A gyro pita with 3 pieces of meat.... Not grilled. Plain fries and a Diet Coke for 20 bucks! I should've known better with the discreet pricing and non descriptive receipt. Absolutely horrible. Worth 5 bucks max."}
{"text":"piss poor. do not waste ur money!!!!  my food was so damn salty. i felt like i had a salt philly rather than a chicken philly. no onion. no grilled peppers. no cheese!!! wtf. no condiments. just salt, salt and more salt with a side if salt!!! vegas had failed in the the food realm for me esp at this place. the one place that is open for late night eats and all i get is a fucking salt lick.  hell  to the fucking no wouldn't recommend!!! the can't even get a half a star from me.  im going to get hypertension just from that one meal!!!   epic failure on sooooooo many levels'!!!!  trash dog!!!"}
{"text":"I wish theres -5 on the rating. First off all, we decided to go here at 4am to grab a quick appetizer here and as we were ordering the food,the guy who helped us was the most disturbing guy I have ever seen. I saw how he grab the money in his hands with the gloves and grab the 3 chicken tenders and put this in the microwave without changing his gloves! That is the most DISGUSTING thing! How is he not gonna change his gloves and serve the food after touching the money!!!!! I ended up cancelling the order after seeing that!!! Cmon man!!!! Did his manager ever teach him about food sanitary!!! I would never go here ever again!!!!! So please anyone who sees this review be careful!!!!"}
