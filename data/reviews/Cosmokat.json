{"text":"I have gone to the same hair stylist for most of my life. When I moved to Arizona I had terrible luck in flagstaff finding someone I trusted with my hair and even had my long hair chopped off short during a \"trim\". I came down to Kat and she listened & took care of my needs and my color, cut and blowouts have been wonderful. I drive 2 hours to see her!"}
