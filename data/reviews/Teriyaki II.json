{"text":"New spot.  A friend brought me some to-go food that I think had been sitting in his car too long.  Was decent for the money, will certainly give them another shot and try it fresh."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and it was definitely better than I was expecting. I used to frequent another Japanese restaurant in this area and after this visit I will come back to teriyaki II instead. The hibachi was very tasteful and I loved the noodles! I got the yum yum roll and it was so good, but I wish the spicy mayo was thicker. I could barely see any. I also thought the sweet tea tasted a few days old, that's the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. Good place to dine in or Togo!"}
{"text":"After complaining to Postmates, they claim they could not refund me bc it was a food quality issue and not a delivery issue. I then called and complained to Teriyaki II. The lady who answered the phone, Casia, was completely rude!!! She pretty much did not believe that i threw the food up and asked for a doctors note! No, are you going to refund me my $13 and my $100 urgent care visit money as well...i highly doubt it. I asked who the owner was and she would not tell me. She just kept saying they weren't available and they were traveling abroad. All i wanted was a name, but i never received that. I then threatened to call the health department and her reply was \"ok, go ahead and call them\". So per her request, that is my next step. Bright and early tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"As a vegan I highly recommend the hibachi tofu plate. They pretty much know what they're doing. I've order this for takeout and dine in and I give them a #highfive for consistency and delishishness!"}
