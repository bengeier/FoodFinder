{"text":"Love this place!  The owners (brothers) are very sweet. They have an awesome phone ordering system where they can pull up your last order and read it to you. Makes re-ordering a breeze!  Suggest the California rolls (add cream cheese), the crazy rolls, casaloma rolls, dynamite and crazy rolls....all awesome."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Very friendly and helpful delivery person. Good portions. Loved the calamari @ a very good price. Sushi had large pieces of fish in it and tasty."}
{"text":"The sushi took almost 2 hours to arrive, and was inedible upon arrival. We had 2 bites and threw it all out. Soggy, not fresh, uncooked chicken."}
{"text":"This restaurant \"Gobo Sushi\" is a sham. I tried the restaurant through TasteAway's online ordering system. The Black Cod bento box dinner entree I ordered for $14 was the single most pathetic \"dinner entree\" I have ordered in my life and made me question if someone ate half my meal before presenting it to me for takeout. The rice was half a bowl, the fish must have been 1.5oz at most, there were some vegetables in the box, but more than half the box was empty.... I have been to average Japanese restaurants and even they don't skimp on Black Cod for $14. The Black Dragon roll was okay (average), the 30 pieces of Salmon Sashimi was okay (average), how the heck can they mess up the dinner entree and rip me off like that? My only answer is it was done by design; there is no way they would mistakenly offer me half the portions.  I wish I took pictures, but I didn't. Rainbow Sushi which I ordered from in the past was not open for online ordering on Saturday but they are A LOT better in this department. Average taste, average quality I can live with, but presenting below average portions (when two items were not) is pure insult and disrespect."}
{"text":"Not bad selections. I got the party tray with sushi and rolls-California and dynamite rolls paid around $35 after tip was 40. Nice attentive staff and they gave me tea while I was waiting for takeout. I didn't dine there so not sure how table service is but takeout was quick. Food was not spectacular or fancy but made well, neat and filling. I had a lot left over after sharing with my friend."}
{"text":"Just had absolutely horrendous (lack of) service from this place. Placed an order through Just Eat, was told it would be here at 8. 8:10 rolls around, so I call. I'm told at first, rather rudely, that it will be here \"in a couple of minutes\" followed by him correcting himself and saying it will be here \"at 8:25\". 

8:35 rolls around so I call Just Eat customer service. The helpful fella at Just Eat calls on my behalf at which time he is also told rudely that it will get here when it gets here, essentially. Working out the math being that I was paying $35 for 3 rolls that had at this point been in a car for over half an hour, I decided to cancel my order.

There are lots of sushi restaurants in town. Unless you're doing something pretty remarkable, an hour and a half is too long to wait for food (specifically when you are originally told 40 minutes), but I will never know if that's the case. The guy running the show here is a jerk and I'll never spend a dime with them."}
{"text":"I've never been inside this restaurant but have ordered delivery many times. The food is always fast and good. My only complaint is that the miso soup is not great. Little bland but has lots of extras not normally in miso like mushrooms. This is a safe reliable place to order food from."}
{"text":"Ordered food from here and it was awful. Chicken was all fat and gristle, sashimi was poor quality, tempura was soggy - this is the worst sushi I have had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Got take out, not good. Everything odd tasting and not fresh. Could not eat any of the tempura we ordered, sour half frozen shrimp, old broccoli and rock hard sweet potatoes. Even edamame were overdone and mushy. Most went in garbage. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Price a tad high, customer service for the most part very good, quality of the food I tried wasn't amazing.

Normally when I go to a Japanese restaurant, I have their sushi. However since most of their sushi came out to more than $1 per piece (which is my benchmark), I decided to try something else, so I had their sweet & sour chicken with rice. While the soup & salad the meal came with were quite decent, all I could taste was the tomato sauce that was used with the main course.

The staff was attentive and patient, which was nice.

With that in mind, I wouldn't mind going back to try some of their sushi (although again, price-wise I find them to be a bit pricey)."}
{"text":"Gobo is right around the corner from where we live and after we moved in Feb 1st, we checked it out and it proved to be pretty satisfactory! The service was great -- there's always this really nice young Asian male waiter who is sort of shy but really polite and attentive. On top of that, the quality is pretty banging for the price. You see a lot of sushi places at this tier who love to overstuff their sushi rolls with rice and it ends up filling you far too quickly. Thankfully this place isn't like that. We like to get the sashimi and make platter 2, but my boyfriend has also tried the black cod which is excellent. All the fish is fresh as well! It's not like the best sushi you're going to get in Toronto but it's priced decently and at this end of the city, it's pretty much the only place open within walking distance."}
{"text":"Before anything else, it pains me to write a bad review when an establishment is a mom and pop type of business. The last thing I wanna do is \"kick a horse when it's almost dead\"

However ... This place DESERVES IT.

I ordered food from this establishment using TASTEAWAY as they had a 40% off promo. The food I got, just about 40% off what I should have gotten.

I ordered:

Katsudon (pork cutlet with egg on a bed of rice) - it was mostly rice with a few pieces of pork. Katsudon never had broccoli, but here they have it hoping you wouldn't notice how few the pork pieces were. The pork pieces were from a cheap cut of pork and had bones, tendons and fat.

Bento box with beef teriyaki. Beef was a measly potion and had 1/2 of fat in it. Salad was almost spoiled so we threw that out. Miso soup tasted funky so we threw it out. California rolls were so-so.

Seafood tempura - check out the picture I uploaded. See how big the scallop pieces are compared to a dime. It was like half of a scallop cut into three pieces. Absolutely PATHETIC. 

Tuna roll - I agree with the previous picture uploaded here. Turn the roll over and you barely see any fish. It's all on the top side. It's an old trick used by cheapo Japanese restaurants.

I hope this place closes down soon as people do not deserve to eat crap like this.

NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I give it a 3 1/2. It's clean waitress was really nice food was fresh and quick tasty not my best but good. Sushi and portions were a little small but I didn't. Mind I hate feeling over stuffed. Lunch special was cheap. Not the kind of place I would bring friends to but by myself for lunch since it's close to home sure I'll be back"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi for the ladies in my office, I contacted the restaurant for a 12 noon delivery and they were on time. The sushi was absolutely fresh and fantastic:) The only complaint was the cuts were thin other than that everyone in the office was very pleased"}
{"text":"My boss asked me to pick up lunch for our staff (7 people).  Google says you're opened so I call to place an order for pick up - got no answer 30 minutes after opening (12:00pm).  I decided to walk over thinking maybe there is only one staff member working and that they are busy.  I arrived at 12:30pm to an open sign on the door, all lights off, door locked.  I tried calling again, waited 5 minutes and knocked.  No answer.  Your sign says you open at 11:30am.  Your website says you open at 11:30am.  Google ads say you ate open at 11:30am. 

I won't be coming again."}
{"text":"Ordered from here with a friend.  The vegetarian sushi was saturated in oil and tasted old.  Stomach was left feeling upset for hours afterwards.  The rice was translucent, and the whole thing tasted rubbery.  Honestly, it was disgusting and quite disappointing.  Even if it were close to the end of the night and we were eating scraps, it wouldn't be an excuse, except it was mid-evening."}
{"text":"so delicious! we had some special requests as we're vegetarians and the staff was incredibly accommodating, making some dishes especially vegetarian for us. the avocadoes in the sushi were fresh & perfect (the avocado spicy crisp roll was amazing!)"}
