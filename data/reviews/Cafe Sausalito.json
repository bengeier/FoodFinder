{"text":"I went here recently for lunch and it was just OK....  Anyways, they have some neat little window - art things that I liked (better than the food)... pictures of those, as well as a link to their full menu, are on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/06/cafe-sausalito.html)   I asked for honey for my french fries and the waitress said that they had it, but \"They use it for cooking\" so she wouldn't bring me any.  Meh."}
{"text":"Babu came highly recommended from a friend so my fiancé and I were excited. It seem to start out great. He sent us a contract we were working with the galleria. Even paid a deposit. Then it went downhill from there. 8 months before our wedding the galleria sent us an email stating they were purchased by a new vendor and will no longer be able to accommodate our wedding. They instantly stopped answering our phone calls and emails. Babu, felt bad for us and started to try and help us, at least it seemed like he did. He stated he called hundreds of venues and no one had anything available. I took days off from work and starting calling myself. Guess what, found one. I'm not exactly sure who or if Babu even bothered calling anyone.  That was my first mistake. My fiancé and I had been doing everything ourselves we should have kept it that way. Babu was extremely upset he had basically lost his job as well. So I introduced him to our venue. He signed a contract with him and continued his business.He kept telling us how grateful he was for us finding him a new job, and that he would do anything to help us out with our wedding. When we asked to meet with him in February he told us that his father passed away and he wouldn't be able to meet with us because he was out of the country. We apologized and gave our condolences for his loss. We waited two whole months before he reached out and contacted him again. Between my fiancé and I we sent him probably a total of 10 messages/voicemails/emails over the course of 3-4 months. At this point we are about a month away from our wedding when we spoke with our vendor for a venue. He informed us that Babu decided he was not going to help us with our wedding any longer. We had to search for a new wedding Cordinator for the day of since he left us high and dry a month before the wedding. Not only is he completely unprofessional but once we did find a wedding coordinator we found out he does this quite often. We found out two months ago he did this to another family who had been paying him for months to take care of their daughter's wedding and he just stop returning all phone calls. I'm gonna make sure I put a review on every website so no one has to deal with what we had to go through. Please stay away from Babu!!! He is a horrible human being who does not care about your wedding day or you, he is simply looking for the next paycheck. Based off my friend and few other reviews I can only assume he picks and chooses who he helps, and who he randomly drops. Please, stay away. I can't imagine anyone having to go through the pain and struggle we did, this is supposed to be the happiest day of your life, and you don't want it to be miserable because of one man. Please Please Please do your research and stay away from Babu and anything he does!"}
{"text":"I came here for a mid-day work function and ordered a grilled cheese with veggies. The sandwich was soggy and the zucchini and mushrooms weren't even cooked. I've had better take away food at airports and train stations. The service was quick given how many there were in our party. However it was incredibly disorganized at the end when we were all trying to pay."}
{"text":"Been here several times for work related reasons. The food is usually average nothing really remarkable the service is usually pretty good. Although my last time here the server was TERRIBLE! It took her 1 hour & a half to serve our party of 10"}
{"text":"We had my daughter's wedding reception at the Galleria on 8-10-13 and I have to say that Cafe Sausalito was one of the best caterers I have ever seen!!! They did a fantastic job from the beginning to the very end. The food was the BEST I have ever had at a wedding. EVERYONE told us how great the food was and that is something you want to hear. The service was also excellent Babu runs a very tight ship. He made sure everything was exactly like my daughter and her husband wanted. We were all very happy that the night went fantastic and there was nothing at ALL to complain about. We would definitely recommend the Galleria and Cafe Sausalito for a wedding venue!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here once or twice in the past and it wasn't horrible. Even attended a wedding here. But recently I went in there for a drink and dinner with a friend. The service was slow and terrible. I ordered a steak medium- it was dry, nasty and overcooked. My friend ordered a burger well done and it was raw. They recooked it and it came back charred. The owner is perverted and a pig! Won't take no for an answer and definitely made us feel uncomfortable. We didn't even finish our food we walked out. Won't ever come back again."}
{"text":"This lovely restaurant is located inside the Galleria mall in downtown Cleveland. This mall was once a beautiful shiny destination downtown. But, like many other things in downtown Cleveland it has faded away. I have to say downtown has a lot to offer. Some really magnificent old buildings that not only have history, but also well designed and well built. It is really a shame ,just like many other once great cities it has been left to die off. But, enough about that back to the restaurant. It is decorated very late 80's ,early 90's. Which in a way is nice, showing days gone by. It is a great location on the 2nd floor with a great view.  We came in for lunch. We were waited on promptly by the Bartender. Even though we sat at a table. He was pretty good ,he waited on tables and worked the bar. He did a great job at it as well. We did not have to wait long for anything. The food was very good.The soup was nice and hot. My friend got a huge portion of pasta. So much she had to take it with her. Our Drinks were refilled promptly, service was great.  The food was decent. I would come back for sure. The place was very relaxing, our booth overlooked the first level. It was nice."}
{"text":"Meh. Was stuck downtown in snowy conditions, looking for somewhere to eat beside the Westin Hotel I was staying at, and this was close enough through the slush. I walked into this mostly shut-down mall which is largely a food court now. i was looking for something decent to sit down to eat. I don't know why but i opted for this place. First, the service was meh. Slow, not very good, attentive or helpful. I wanted a sparkling water. It looked like the kind of place you might get a Perrier or Pelligrino, and the server went off to see if they had that. I ended up with plain old Club Soda. OK, I can live with that.   I ordered the \"lobster\" or something similar seafood bisque. It was thick, pasty and full of fake crab. It was not very warm. I ate it, though, I was starving, and it was edible, just not really good.   I also ordered the tomatoes with basil, \"fresh mozzarella\" and balsamic. The tomatoes were horribly firm and not ripe enough to serve. These hard slabs of tomato were cut over an inch thick. It was like their took a hard tomato and sliced the ends off, then cut the rest into three slabs, stacked it with some cheese, tossed a leaf on it, drenched it in balsamic and said, \"Order up!\" The cheese was anything but fresh. At least the basil leaves were OK. I didn't finish it. Yuck.  I ordered their Cobb Salad with beef filet on it. It was, perhaps, the most weird take on a Cobb I'd ever had. It had this disgusting dressing on it that completely removed it from the world of a traditional Cobb Salad. If you want to serve a Cobb, just serve a real Cobb and don't try to be cute or fancy with it. Ya'll mucked this one up. The dressing you serve with it is nasty.   I tried, really, I tried to eat this but I couldn't. I picked around at the steak bits and ate what I could from it, then I just got out my credit card and when I finally got the server's attention, I just handed it to her so I could quickly leave."}
{"text":"Good for lunch, but kind of dead after work. Slow service from bartenders. Not a great beer selection."}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business?  I stopped in here with coworkers for happy hour and the place was dead.  We had heard that the happy hour was great but they only had bud light and miller light for $2.  And the majority of other beers they were out of. There were 2 bartenders and three of us, that was it.  And it took forever to get them to give us a drink. And they got it wrong 50% of the time.  Checks took awhile too. Not sure what is going on here.."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing Sausalito Catering and the Galleria here, and I can't believe there aren't more of these, or a separate page for them--there is so much to say!  Sausalito Catering was the best wedding day choice my now husband and I made. They took care of absolutely everything--from the delicious food my guests are still raving about to recommendations for linen companies, florists, DJ's, limo rentals, photographers (and more!), to ensuring that our offsite beach wedding was going to be hassle free!! Babu and his team are always available, no matter when you call, and are always going to do their very best to get you what you need, even if you don't know what that is! Need help determining a head table set up or how to design your Pinterest-inspired driftwood escort cards? No problem. Babu can help. Need to hire a group of guys to rake Huntington Beach (ceremony location), set up your driftwood arbor, greet the florist upon arrival, and stake your claim on the public beach spot you chose for your nuptials a year ago? Simple, just call Babu! Seriously, though, all of this and more was handled by Sausalito Catering and Babu and the results and level of care provided way exceeded our expectations. If you want to actually enjoy your wedding day and the planning that leading up to it entails, hire Sausalito Catering and Babu. It was the best wedding day decision this happily married couple made!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that a place that's been open for 22 years (22 years!) can have so few reviews, but I'll try to put a stop to that now.  Cafe Sausalito? Pretty freaking good! Nothing fancy...which, given the extremely low prices, shouldn't be a surprise. But they have some great lunch specials that are as inexpensive as Panera...with much much better ambiance.   To set it up, I went here with a few friends back in 1992, after we missed a Tribe game due to it having been a day game instead of a night game. So, the teenagers we were, we took excitedly to the big city (A la Ferris Bueller), read the artwork, danced in the Public Square fountain and toured around the Galleria, with the extensive shops they had back in the day (Banana Republic, etc). We had a grand time, and weren't looked down upon by the server. We noticed, and tipped well because of it.  So guess what? It's still friggin open. Not an easy trick for something in the Galleria.  So...onto the food. I had the Chef's Misto Salad/Chicken Tortellini Soup special ($6.95!!), my beautiful Brazilian companion, in town for a few days, had a salmon salad (around $8). She got a glass of wine, a reasonable $7 (she's used to NY prices). All together it came to like $23.  My food was simple and tasty. Liked it a lot. She loved her salad.  The waitress joked with me on how I hadn't been around in 15 years...stuff like \"What should I care if you're not going to be back for another decade...?\". Witty banter is fun.  Obviously, the Galleria is beautiful, and Cafe Sausalito is open-air to it, looking down over the food court and up into the glass roof and so-on. The restaurant has some nice styling, with wine bottles on racks and a nice looking bar.   GREAT for game days or Science Center or Hall of Fame visits!  Galleria parking is a bit pricey (it maxes out at $13 after 4 hours...but, a deal the longer you stay, I suppose).  So yeah! I'm a fan. Will be back before a decade and a half transpires. Great food for not *that* much more than you'd pay at the food court downstairs."}
{"text":"The reports of Cafe Sausalito's death have been greatly exaggerated.  Given how far the Galleria has fallen since it opened in the late 80's, my expectations for Cafe Sausalito--a restaurant I hadn't visited in at least 10 years--were very low.  I wouldn't have been that surprised to walk into a wasteland, complete with cobwebs and tumbleweed.  Instead, what I found was the pretty standard business crowd having lunch, filling about 70% of the seating inside (I didn't get a look at the \"outside\" dining area that is open to the Galleria food court).  Sausalito features a pretty large dining area with a large bar and two levels of tables (i.e., one level a couple steps higher than the other) on the main floor.  I had the beef brisket sandwich, which turned out to be a pretty sizable pile of beef brisket on a bun absolutely slathered in barbecue and honey dijon mustard sauces.  For the sake of my work clothes, I opted to go open-face on the sandwich and knife-and-fork it (something I very rarely do).  The mustard sauce overpowered the taste of the meat, but I could live with it.  The quality and the cooking of the meat isn't going to come close to rivaling even a chain barbecue place, but it was adequately cooked and fit the purposes of the sandwich.  It was the size of the portion that really surprised me.  I also liked the fact that I could substitute the fries with vegetables, which ended up being julienne green and yellow zucchini.  Service was pretty basic, though I thought it could have been a bit quicker for the simpler tasks like getting the check ready to go.  My leisurely (but cold) walk to the office and back (a little over three blocks) with lunch at Cafe Sausalito took about one hour and five minutes.  On top of that, my meal plus an iced tea cost me $9.10 before tip.  Not too shabby at all."}
{"text":"I wrote a one star review about our terrible experience on 3/31/17.  The manager wrote me a nice email stating he was new to the establishment and thanked me for contacting him. He offered me and my guest a free meal.  While I won't take advantage of the freebie it was a step in the right direction for him to contact me and indicate he would work on the problems."}
{"text":"Suzie and the chef did it again!  Great service and food on my second visit which proves my first good experience was not just luck."}
{"text":"Food is not so great. Clam chowder is more like flour chowder. Seafood is not fresh. They are not used to large dinner groups. Hamburgers are ok."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today. I was with my wife and son. They asked if we wanted a menu for my little boy. I said yes. Then they said they don't have kids menus. . I never would have guessed that this is an Italian restaurant by the menu. We ordered calamari, black bean chili \"soup\", and a taco salad. They gave us bread before the meal that was quite good. My wife liked the calamari. The black bean soup had about ten beans in it and it was so salty it was inedible. The taco salad was mediocre at best. The prices are reasonable. The food is just ok."}
{"text":"The Galleria has seen better days, but Cafe Sausalito keeps soldiering on. When I'm in the mood to sit down for lunch, this is a good change of pace. The menu features primarily burgers, salads, and sandwiches, all very competent. There's a crab cake that changes styles regularly, and the pasta selections I've had are really good. Service has always been very efficient and accommodating, even when we need six separate checks at the table (be sure to tip well for that, ladies and gents).  I recommend eating \"outside\" on the food court side, where you're assured some actual daylight."}
{"text":"Stopped in yet again today with a co-worker.  Today, we both ordered chicken wraps with fries.  The fries were served nearly cold, but they were still tasty.  My buffalo chicken wrap was fresh and very tasty.  My co-worker's chicken salad wrap was very tasty and he really liked it.  The service was good and you know we'll be back.  I haven't had a bad meal here yet."}
{"text":"Found myself in the Galleria, of all places, for lunch and gave this place a spin.  It wasn't bad.  Reasonable portions for reasonable prices, but not necessarily a cheap or quick lunch.  Lunch and a beverage came in at the $10-15 range, and it took our party of three a little more than an hour for the meal. Aided by the pineapple salsa topping pulled pork sandwich was good, but it did have a nagging sloppy joe flavor that seemed a little out of place.  The fries were nothing to write home about.  The seafood bisque was good, but I would have liked a thicker consistency.  Our server was friendly, but seemed maybe a little overwhelmed with the lunch rush.  Here's the thing, I'd be happy to go back, but I am rarely downtown and wouldn't make it a point to go there to eat here.  If you do spend your time downtown during the day, stop in for a decent meal."}
{"text":"This place is bizarre.  It is located in \"The Galleria\" which looks like a mall that was abandoned as part of Zombie apocalypse.   Literally.    Only a few businesses occupy this vast building that you are left to wonder what happened.   Anyway, onto the meal - or lack thereof...  First, this restaurant is severely understaffed.   Those employees on hand were running around doing as best they could, but were clearly stretched to the limits.   Kitchen forgot our appetizer order so, let's go onto the meals.   I ordered the General T'Sao chicken special... or at least I thought I did.  What I received was some sort of fried chicken breast covered with some sort of purportedly Asian-flavored sauce.  Again, fits with the whole \"bizarre\" theme.   My wife ordered a fish sandwich that was more sandwich (meaning bread) than fish.     Prices are generally reasonable, and maybe we just made the wrong selections, but would look elsewhere before making a return visit."}
{"text":"Cafe Sausalito is a great spot; #1 for lunch in the middle of the day, #2 for catering your event, and #3 paired with the Galleria as a venue for an event. My wife and I did our wedding there in July 2014 and had a great experience. We can't say enough good things about Babu, Vicki and their crew of folks making everything just right. All of our guests enjoyed their food and everyone had a great time. The price was competitive and the service was incredible. Highly recommended for lunch or for catering events. Hope to visit Cleveland again soon and stop in their for some of their delicious salmon."}
{"text":"This update is not for the restaurant, this is for the catering business, Sausalito Catering. I went to a wedding at the Galleria. The food was awesome. The servers were awesome. Huge portions. Great food. Salmon with wasabi/teriaki sauce. The servers were the most attentive I've had at a wedding lately. Super professional. I would recommend this catering company to anyone."}
