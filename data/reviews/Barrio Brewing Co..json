{"text":"We waited 30 minutes with no one taking our drink or food order. We left. Very disappointing. There weren't very many people there either. If they're going to make it they need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Being fans of the Tucson location (we often drop in if we're down there and the timing lines up with lunch or dinner needs), my wife and I finally decided to check this place out tonight when we needed a bite to eat and didn't want to go too far from our house over in Eastmark.  We arrived around 8 PM to about 15 odd folks around the bar and not much otherwise in the way of patrons. No worries, grabbed a seat near the window at the back of the building (being literally feet from various aviation stuff is kind of neat, especially if you are into that). Service was pretty prompt and we quickly had drinks followed by a reasonable wait for food.  $3 beer pint specials and Taco Tuesday discounts were a nice surprise also and definitely helped with the value side of the visit. I order a Citrazona and my wife grabbed a stout and both were very good. In the visits to the Tucson location I've always found their beer to be very solid, maybe not the most exciting, but just consistent and extremely drinkable and this held true.  Food overall was pretty decent and portions were reasonable. From other reviews it sounds like service can be a bit spotty (or at least they were having some growing pains when they first opened), but we had no complaints.  Overall, a very solid visit and I'm pretty confident we'll head back periodically. I'll also mention that it's nice and kid friendly (we had our infant with us and will not hesitate to bring him back in the future)."}
{"text":"I had the Spinach Artichoke dip, Big Bang Burger, coleslaw and a brew.  The appetizer was hot and tasty with plenty of chips to dip with.   My burger had just enough heat from the pepper & chipotle cream cheese spread.  The food was cooked just as I ordered and there was plenty left to take home.  The service was very good, I was greeted at the door when I arrived my drink glass was continually filled and when departing I was bid a good rest of my evening.  The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. The prices are comparable with restaurants in the valley.  I am a repeat customer and will visit again very soon!"}
{"text":"Tried coming here in the afternoon. At least 15 tables vacant (multiple were empty on patio), and was quoted a minimum of 30 minute wait time for a party of 3. Others waiting had been there for 30 minutes without being seated. Left after waiting 20 minutes while multiple tables remained vacant. Such a shame, was really hoping to test this place out. Unfortunately, the poor service has been a consistent complaint I've heard of."}
{"text":"Having worked in a restaurant industry before I am more critical. The summary: the food is good, not great. The beer is good! The location is amazing because you can see airplanes in and out. The service is good not great. The servers seem to not have the biggest focus on making a great customer focus, but it's definitely not bad by any means. My suggestion would be to increase the quality of food (even if it means increased price, focus on an amazing customer experience since the airport is an experience itself, and get the servers to have some more passion) this is a solid and well deserved 4 star rating, definitely need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place, but sadly it was a huge disappointment.  I order a Lizzy salad the menu description said it came with grilled chicken. My husband order the chicken tacos. Imagine our disappoint when BOTH of our meals had regular sliced deli lunchmeat chicken! Seriously, chicken tacos made from deli lunchmeat??? We even looked at the menu to see if we had misread the description of our meals. Very misleading!!! We asked of server if we got the wrong food and she said, oh no, that's just very thin sliced grilled chicken. Oh come on, we all know what lunchmeat looks like, including the little brown strip around the edges.   In addition, it was 83 degrees in the restaurant. I was setting by the thermostat had no problems reading just how hot it was.   We did like the beer however, but won't be back"}
{"text":"I see now why our friends rave about Barrio Brewing. Great food, unique beers, and even better service. Thank you Justin for making us feel so welcome. Fun time watching the planes take off and land. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Place was legit. Great service/great location. Beers are bueno! Samantha was the greatest. I like planes."}
{"text":"Not at all pleased with this place and I wasn't even able to get seated and try the food! We showed up today around 2pm for a late lunch. We walked in the back door (because we didn't know there was a front door) and walked to find a table, when the hostess rudely walked over and said \"there's a 25 minute wait and these tables are reserved\" so we walked over to her stand, put our name in and stood there. For 32 minutes to be exact. All the while we counted EIGHTEEN empty tables...inside & outside. Unfortunately, this place is severely underemployed....and the hostess needs some training in explaining to people just why we have a wait time when there are so many tables open. I'd like to try this place again because I think the airport atmosphere is cool, just not sure I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"The beer here is always good. Unfortunately, you can't count on the food or service. It's very inconsistent.  It's close to home for us so we continue to comeback but our expectations are never too high.  It's sad because the Tucson location is usually good.  Get it together Barrio."}
{"text":"I realize it just opened and they have to work out the kinks but a bit overpriced. Must be the lease fee thats killing them.Had a couple beers and finger food. $40? No airport employee discount. I'll just stick with my normal hole-in-the-wall from now on."}
{"text":"Having been to the original Barrio Brewery in Tucson, this is quite different. Where that one is located in an industrial area in south Tucson, this one is located at Phoenix/Mesa Gateway Airport, which is cool by itself (especially if you like planes).  It's a bit of a drive if you aren't in the Southeast Valley, but it's worth a try anyway.  The beer is excellent (I prefer the Barrio Citrazona IPA), with lots of choices.  The menu is pretty much bar-standard, with burgers and sandwiches being the main choices.  But, the food is good and plentiful.  The outdoor seating is not huge, but if you like planes, there's plenty to watch.  The indoor seating has plenty of windows looking over the ramp (i.e. where the planes park), and you can watch them taking off and landing easily.    I've been there a couple of different times, and it can get busy on Friday and Saturday nights.  I'm very glad for Open Table as we got in right away, even though it was busy.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great experience, great service, good food and good beer.  Out servers were awesome.  I would highly recommend. And hanging watching the jets take off and land is added bonus!!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast once after they first opened and it was ok at best. Just came for dinner and it is now one of our favorite places. Food was awesome and our server (Summer) was awesome! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and nice and close to everything on the airport.. Great staff as well.Came over between flights and they were fast and friendly enough that there were no issues. Great scenery as well with airlines, flightschools and a FBO next door."}
{"text":"Good food with medium sized portions, cool window view of planes, and decent selection of beer. Worth trying for sure!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was decent.  But the real feature here is the activity outside on the flightline. Last time we were there there were 6 Marine Harrier jets sitting just outside.  Probably lucky for us that the service was slow else we'd have left and missed the experience of watching 4 of those beasts come to life"}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. Food was cooked just to our liking. Will definitely be back. Wtg Barrios."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, food, and best of all.....beer! First time here and it's going to be a new favorite."}
{"text":"This place is great! The beer was really good, food was delicious and our waiter was super helpful. We came for taco Tuesday, $2.50 tacos!  Happy hour until 7:00!  We'd been avoiding coming here because we assumed it would be a hassle in an airport. Turns out It is separate from it but still on the runway, so the view is cool! You can watch planes take off and land (great for little ones and airplane lovers). Plenty of parking available!"}
{"text":"Great place... fighter jets right outside 5he windows... pilots walk right in off the tarmack.. good food...good service...great beer!  Hard to find!  It is right on the airfield!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place!!  Great Beer... Great food. Amanda, Tyler and Chuck are fantastic behind the bar. Haven't had a lunch or breakfast that I didn't like yet. And the bonus... All the military aircraft hanging out right outside the door.  If you are a craft beer/aviation geek... There is no better place!"}
{"text":"My first one star review which is a bummer. It sucks when you have such a poor experience that it drives you to write a review.   Save yourself a visit. Having high hopes, we arrived to a decent crowd but not even close to slammed. Sat outside. For over 15 minutes without even a single acknowledgement by the plethora of staff that walked past us.   This at least offered us an opportunity to look at the menu. Which struck us a bit pricy. $13 for a turkey sandwich. But more so, we kept looking for the craft beer. With a title noting 'BREWERY' we'd expected to have an exciting experience ahead of us. Instead there was maybe 9 beer names listed in a bottom corner, of which, has no explanation of what it was, ABV % or beer type. 'Citrazona' 'RubyRed' that was literally it.   At the 20 minute mark we politely asked a passerby staff member to please help us and they said they would grab our server. A few minutes later someone else grabbed a server walking by and 'said this is also your table' and his response was an exclamation of 'JESUS CHRIST' and walked inside without even a look to our table. That was the tipping point for us to leave. Unfortunately I can't even comment on the food or drinks because we didn't make it that far. Maybe we caught them on a bad night but I don't know we will try again after this false start."}
{"text":"Tried this brewery out last night, and came away very impressed!  I love trying out breweries, and am admittedly critical when reviewing beer selections, the food, etc.  Barrio Brewing Co. checked all the boxes for me.    My wife and I tried out 5 of their beers, which included Blanco IPA (it wasn't on the menu, so make sure you ask for it!), Copperhead Pale Ale (a sweet tasting Pale), Mocha Java Stout, Nolan's Porter Ale, & a Grapefruit IPA (don't remember the official name).  Everything we tried was outstanding, I'll have a tough time picking out what I'll drink first on my next trip there.  My wife and I both had the Fire Starter Burger w/ beer battered fries from the menu, and we both agreed that it was one of the best burgers we've ever had.  This place is also kid friendly, with a decent kids menu, and plenty for the kids to look at outside the patio area of the brewery, where their are some USMC fighter jets parked just outside.  This place will become a normal hangout for the family and I."}
{"text":"I like it. Been here 2 times in the last month. First time we sat by the window with a view of two Marine Corps Harriers parked on the flight line and ate good stuff.  Today (Sunday) after the football rush time we sat and enjoyed a good dinner. I had the Baja Fish Tacos which were very good. Only criticism is why the beans side dish with fish tacos. And I mean beans, like Boston Baked Beans???  Should be an option for refried beans or black beans with that dish.   Oh...and their Rojo beer is quite excellent.   Overall service on both visits was very attentive. Amanda on the second visit laughed at my lame attempt at humor so that was plus 2 stars."}
{"text":"Went there last week for the first time, great atmosphere, friendly staff. Food was good, beer selection was niece, service was excellent(Thanks, Brit). Fun to see planes land and take off. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the service and my food. I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad and I got lunch meat for the chicken. I really love this place and I hope they better some of their menu items and hire more staff."}
{"text":"This place is EXACTLY what East Mesa/Gilbert was missing. The ambiance is so cool as the restaurant is right next to an airport and you can watch planes take off and land while you eat.  Their beer is some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend Citrazona and Grapefruit IPA. Now for the food. I've yet to get something I didn't love here. My favorite is their Popper Burger. Once I tried it, I have to get it every single time. Their buns make it too. They have a slightly sweet flavor and it's mouth watering. I've also had great service each time.   There's reason my family and I come here almost weekly, it's a wonderful local joint!"}
{"text":"Cool out of the way place. I didn't even know they had a valley location until a few months ago. Been back many times since. Air Force jets take off a short distance away, so we had an interesting show. Beers are good and the burgers are delicious."}
{"text":"The food is good. I don't think that has ever been the problem the last 3 times we came. The problem is the service. We always sit at the bar and it consistently takes 10 minutes to be greeted and another 5-10 to get a drink. This is a mile away from us and we would come much more often if we weren't so concerned about the level of service we get. Make sure to order two drinks at a time so you don't run on empty!"}
{"text":"As I sit here waiting for a flight to land bringing in one of my family members I am having one of the most memorable experiences. We were greeted by an extremely friendly individual who we found out later is the manager \"Michael\". Michael immediately asked us if we had ever been in before and since we hadn't and were interested in the beers he offered us samples. We went with the raspberry ale and a Paloma drink. We were very relaxed and laughing for the few hours we were here. My husband who isn't a drinker asked for a second raspberry ale that gave off such a sweet aroma I could smell it sitting next to him. We shared the Sonoran dog and the bang bang burger with beer battered french fries. The dishes did not disappoint and makes me want to search for a similar spot near where we live to enjoy more often. The two hours we waited went by so quickly that it didn't feel like a wait at all! All the staff were extremely attentive and friendly we enjoyed chatting with them. Michael even offered to make me his specialty drink! Cranberry, orange juice, sprite and deep eddy vodka was a hit if you enjoy a lightly sweetened drink. It was refreshing. A nice spot that would be fun to stop in even if you aren't waiting for a flight."}
{"text":"I've decided that I'm only going to take the time to write reviews on places that I had a positive experience at. Unless, it's REALLY bad. With that being said my first experience at Barrio Brewing was great! Our server, Michael, was really friendly and helpful explaining the food, beer and history of Barrio. If you go in ask for him, you won't be disappointed.   Now for the beer... Really great craft beers. I started off with the Citrizona IPA and it was a great starter. Not very hoppy and nice citrus tones. My girlfriend had the Taylor Jayne's Raspberry Ale and it was nice too with the raspberry nicely pronounced. We then ordered a flight of four where we had the seasonal Beach Brew (great citrus flavor right off the top), another IPA that I can't remember the name of and also the Mocha Java Stout which was really great! Kind of like a coffee milk shake. But, my favorite of the flight was the Grapefruit IPA. Which really surprised me because I don't like grapefruit. This, however, was really delicious!   And the food... I ordered The Sonoran Dog with fries. Michael, the server, brought it out with the beer battered fries because the normal fries weren't ready. Man am I glad he did!!! Those fries were BOMB!!! Really crispy and honestly one of the better fries I've ever had. The dog was awesome with nice beans, tomato and onion. The only critique I would make is that I couldn't taste the bacon. I wish they would have used thick cut bacon to bring out the bacon more. My girlfriend order The Phoenix and she said the chicken was really moist and the jalapeno bacon was an awesome surprise.   All in all a great experience! Defiantly have a Grapefruit IPA and defiantly spend the extra .75 cents on the beer battered fries. Can't wait to go back and try one of the burgers."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS BREWERY SO MUCH AND THE BARTENDER, ASTRID!!! Great beer, drinks, AND food  Astrid is probably one of my all time fave bartenders she's very knowledgeable and personable when it comes to knowing the brewery and being a bartender. All us regs love it!"}
{"text":"Great potential here.  I would give it four stars but I wasn't thrilled with my dish...their Reuben, which is apparently a specialty.  Tastes were fine, but it seems they didn't cut the corned beef against the grain, but rather WITH the grain, which resulted in pretty tough and stringy bites of meat.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dish.  Kids gobbled up theirs as well.  Service was excellent.  Michael(?) was quite attentive and made sure we were well taken care of.  Good addition to the area.  I'm sure they'll continue to improve and I sincerely hope to up my rating after next visit."}
{"text":"Have been here a handful of times and it is hit or miss. As others mentioned the issue is not the food, beer or venue.  Rather it is the service.  Went again tonight and the place was busy but not packed. Had a group of 5 plus a child. Bar seating had maybe 3 people and table tops were half full. Was told there would be a 25-30 minute wait.  I get they may be understaffed so we informed the hostess we weren't eating and was wondering if we could just sit at one of the empty tables and we will go to the bar ourselves for service, no big deal.   Hostess went to ask the manager and was told that we had to wait. It is too bad that they turned away business when all we requested was a family friendly seat to show off their establishment to some visiting guests.  I truly hope they make it as the location is great and atmosphere is fun but it seems at times they may not get the big picture."}
{"text":"We didn't know where to head for late beer and food! We didn't want anything cookie cut, so we found this brewery at the airport; worth the trip! We had been introduced by a welcoming young lady, which started us off with drinks and history of the company, two thumbs up for that. We ordered our food and here comes our burger perfectly made and no short cuts even tho we had gotten there 40 mins before closing! I am very happy camper and will be back for more! Cheers"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Relaxed and kid friendly to boot. Great beer and great food. Kitchen was very slow. It was busy and on a weekend so I can understand."}
{"text":"Good food and great view of planes taking off. Bartender gave us some small samples to help us decide on our beer, and we settled on a half rasp half blonde. Good beer. We ordered a pretzel which was a bit dense, and therefore not really hot through, which was a bit disappointing. I won't order that again, which makes me sad bc I live a good bar pretzel. Even 2 or 3 small superpretzels would have been better. The bartender helped me settle on the fried fish tacos which were wonderful. Husband had black and blue burger, well done, and it actually well-done. It seems to be difficult to cook a burger well-done, so he was very pleased. Service was fast and friendly, and we got to see three marine fighter jets take off at noon on Saturday after lunch, so it was a fun afternoon at Barrio!"}
{"text":"We are always looking for new places for our Sunday meal after church. I found Barrio Brewing on Yelp early this morning. My parents always enjoy watching planes, so I knew we had to give it a try.   My Dad had the Diane Burger. He said it was the best burger he's ever had. I had the French dip. We both really liked how soft and delicious the rolls for our sandwiches were. My mom had the turkey panini.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in making recommendations and answering questions. The manager served us our food and came back around again to see if we enjoyed everything.   Another great place to add into our rotation."}
{"text":"Wow!! Finally tried Barrio Brewing and it did not disappoint!! Me and my wife have been to over 100 brewery's and there Beer was among some of the top in Arizona. There's no bad choice in food as well very very good. If you happen to sit at the bar Samantha is a fantastic bartender!!"}
{"text":"Will not be back. Which sucks because the beer is good, close to home and at times can see really cool airplanes. The food was never really that great, but the pros made up for it. Before today my husband and I had visited the restaurant about 3-4 times. Today the food just sucked. The wings were well just wings, but the carnitas Tacos were AWFUL and could only take one bite. When the waitress finally came back to ask how are food was. I informed her the tacos we're not good and was sending them back. I also informed her my son's Chicken ceaser salad only had 4 pieces of chicken. Truth be told the chicken was sandwich meat. Seriously! Well of course her attitude changed and was not friendly. After today's experience I will not be back."}
{"text":"Cool place overlooking the tarmac of Mess Gateway.  Jets were landing and taking off, making it a neat experience for the kids. Food was really good.  Burgers, wings and beer battered fries were on point.  Beverage selection was very good, with something for everyone."}
{"text":"Samantha the bartender was awesome. The food, service and atmosphere is great. I would recommend Barrio to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great location on the tarmac at Willa's field.  Really great happy hour until 7.  Pale ale and regular IPA excellent."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere! All the dishes I have tried have been wonderful! Love watching the planes come and go; especially the fighter jets!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. It has a unique location at the airport with views is the tarmac. Service was pleasant. Beer is good. Don't bother with a cocktail.   Now for the food. At best the food was mediocre. Serving sizes are good not to large not too small but the quality just isn't there. It lacks character.   I had the Philly cheesesteak which I was told is made with the same meat they use for the French dip which just seems silly.  Those should be two very different sandwiches. The fries were average. My wife had the buffalo chicken sandwich without the bun and again it was mediocre. It's a pre-made frozen breaded chicken breast deep fried and sauced.    We will be back. I'll always give a place a second chance. I am holding out hope for this place."}
{"text":"What a perfect location for a brewery!  We stopped by for lunch and a beer before our flight out of the Mesa Airport.  It was cool seeing planes take off from time to time and had a few tables on the patio to enjoy the beautiful AZ weather.  My husband an I both went with street tacos that really hit the spot!  We like both of the beers that we tried and again couldn't have asked for a better location.  If in the area we would be back for sure."}
{"text":"What a cool local place! Beer good. Fighter  jets good. Good food good. Dog friendly patio good. The combination of all these things, Awesome! Highly recommend breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I hope they take care of their issues because this could be a really cool little place. I know having a larger party (8) at 530 on Saturday night will never be a quick experience...but we were there for over an hour and a half, and all the food wasnt even good. Some of it was great - the pretzels, the Ruben. All of our burgers were dry and hard, one came out way after the rest of the food. One order came out totally wrong, sent it back, came out wrong again. Our server was nice, but we had no silverware and couldn't seem to find him anywhere when we needed that and a few other things. It took at least 20 minutes after asking for it to get our check. We were in such a hurry at that point (5 kids bored out of their minds) that while my husband had the kids outside playing, I quickly signed the check and left...to find out later we were charged $9.50 for wings we didnt order. Totally my fault for not looking at it, but we were so done being there! We will probably stay away from Barrio for awhile, and hope they figure out their kitchen and staffing problems. It just felt like there were far too many patrons in the place than they are prepared to handle at this point."}
{"text":"One of our favorite lunch spots! Service can be a little slow but when you go with a good group of people, you hardly notice!"}
{"text":"My husband and our friends have frequented Barrios a few times.  Garrett has been our server twice and what a nice young man.  The food is excellent and service is good.  The best part of course is the beer and the fact that you can watch planes take off and land.   Weekends are rather busy but give it a chance if you haven't already done so.  All of us use to go to a brewery back home and now we've found something similar and close to our homes here to enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio several times now for dinner and drinks. Each time the food has been excellent and the beer is very good. Barrio has a variety of foods like burgers, sandwiches, salads, and mexican food. They have a full bar and a great view to watch the planes come and go at the airport."}
{"text":"Awesome bartender Astrid is very knowledgeable in her craft beer varieties. Good food and good place to kick back and grab a pint. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here and brought our new puppy. They couldn't have been nicer. Service was great. Our waiter was really sweet and the manager also came to check on us. Burgers were great and the environment seemed really relaxed. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food...Firestarter burger is my favorite. Great service as well want to thank Samatha for her attentiveness to the order speedy service and kind demeanor.   Recommend Barrio Brewing Co.!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and it has been fantastic! The first time I had the French dip with fries and a flight of beer. Not only was the beer awesome the food was great too. My second trip I sat at the bar for lunch. The bartender, Tyler, was on top of his game making sure my iced tea didn't go below half way. I asked him what he recommended to eat and he threw out a ton of suggestions. When he mentioned the Sonoran dog I knew I had to have the Tucson staple. He also recommended the beer battered fries which were in incredible. As I was waiting for my food, Tyler asked if I had tried any of their beers. I replied I did and he gave me a mix of two of the beers on draft.  The peach ale and their raspberry beer. Absolutely delicious mix. The Sonoran dog was messy but delicious. Awesome atmosphere being next to the tarmac, delicious food, great beer, and incredible customer service. All in all a home run!"}
{"text":"Yummy place to eat, watch the planes on the run way, and socialize with friends. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Kid and pet friendly. They have the best beer. The pretzels are a great appetizer. Food was good too. When they are super busy the service is a little slow so that could improve. Look forward to going here again."}
{"text":"Talk about a totally random spot for a brewery! Barrio Brewing is just what I was looking for something close to home, good beer, great views of the airport, good service, and good food. I really enjoyed their grapefruit IPA which won me over. Another good perk is the outside area is kid friendly for kids to run around and play in the grass."}
{"text":"For the most part, I really like Barrio Brewing and I'll be a frequent visitor. However, beware of the exorbitant price they charge for beer flights.  If anything, you should get a better deal on flights so people are encouraged to sample the different beers before they make their decision. Unfortunately, they charge $12 for their 20oz flights when customers would normally get 38oz for that price. That's almost twice as much.  With that said...  Really good lineup of beers. I'm not a big IPA fan, but they actually have some IPA's on tap that I like. The food is good and if you're a fan of flying like I am, you'll like the view."}
{"text":"Breakfast!!! Eggs-perfect, bacon-crispy(not burnt), hash browns-golden. Beer-Rea's Ruby Red(I'm on vacation, don't judge). Awesome! Definetly checking them out for dinner!!"}
{"text":"My husband got the fire starter jalapeño burger. I got the California burger. I really wanted to like this place but this was the blandest food I've ever tasted. I literally had to put salt on my burger, that's how little flavor there was. The food looks like it would taste great but unfortunately there is just zero flavor."}
{"text":"What was supposed to be a special occasion turned into an utter nightmare. It's never fun when you have to leave caring a crying child because he so hungry after waiting 40 minutes after ordering with still no food.This is the fourth time I visited. The first was when it first opened and we waited quite some time for food. When it arrived, they informed my vegetarian friend that they could not make her food because they didn't have the ingredients. They had waited until everybody else's food was out before informing her. The restaurant was new, so I gave it another chance and went two more times. The food is ok, and service has always been slow, but you can't beat the location. However, tonight was awful. Once we were seated, the waiter took our drink orders but failed to bring mine. I had to remind him TWO more times to bring me a drink.Then, after waiting 40 minutes after we ordered, we decided it wasn't worth waiting anymore. We tried to flag down the waiter several times to either speak to the manager, find the status of her food, or just pay for the drinks and go. He looked at us, acknowledged us twice, but would never come over and speak to us knowing that something was wrong. Never in my life I have done this, but we just got up and left with my kid crying saying that he was soo hungry. To my credit, I again tried to flag somebody down to pay for my drink, but I couldn't even find somebody that was willing to even speak to me. I work near this location, and have many coworkers, so I need to let the restaurant know that they have lost a chunk of business from my colleagues. Shame on you. The only redeeming thing is that we ended up spending a lot less money at McDonald's :-) it was just not the night that we were hoping for."}
{"text":"Beers were good. Service was good when we finally got it at the bar. The waitresses were not doing much someone needs to be there to supervise. The food menu looked really good. The food was alright. They were kinda of cheap on the ingredients. I'll be back as I liked the beer."}
{"text":"Having lived in Tucson for several years, I was so glad to see Barrio Brewing pop up in East Mesa! My husband loves to try their beers on tap and to be totally honest I only go for the Sonoran Hot Dog. This is the closest to an authentic Sonoran Hot Dog I have found in Phoenix, though the bun could be toasted better to withstand all the delicious toppings. The best part about this place is the location. Situated right on the tarmac of the Williams Gateway Airport, it's always exciting to see which military and private jets are taking off and wonder where they're heading. The food has been good, but there is definitely room for improvement. Recently, we ordered the pretzel appetizer and it came out stale and tasting like it was from the freezer section of Costco. Their customer service could also use some help. The staff seems young and relatively inexperienced. I realize it's still pretty new but service is slow and not very personal or enthusiastic, and they seem more interested in hanging at the bar talking to each other than giving attentive service. It's definitely worth a try but I hope to see it improve as time goes on."}
{"text":"Really good food with a great view. My husband and I shared the wings and the steak Panini. Both were very good. Plenty of food for lunch. We will defiantly come again ."}
{"text":"Very good food and selection, had a few of their craft beers and they are very good, great view right on the airport can see planes take off and land entertaining for the kiddos"}
{"text":"Great beer service was great only comment I have is order the sauces on the side one time they were good the next too hot for most but still tasted great to me"}
{"text":"I like their beers and it's a great location. The M girl was OK but the fries were cold. The brand on the turkey sandwich was also stale. I think this might be a good place to go for some beers and appetizers but not really for a meal"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 11 people on a Saturday afternoon.  They were not busy.  My group was half way done eating and I had not received my burger.  I was told they gave it to someone else.  By the time our group was almost done eating and I  had still not received what I ordered.  She did  offered me something to snack on while I wait. Then she said they would take it off our bill... I told her to make mine to go.  Two of the people that ordered Ruebens hardly got any sauerkraut so when they asked for more they gave them one small bowl to split and it was served cold.  I got ice tea and asked for the sugars...never got them nor did she bring me a refill.  Thank goodness I bring my own.  Another couple had bottled beer and more than once asked for a cold glass...they never got them.  Other than that everyone else got their food and they seemed happy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the barrio rojo scottish style ale! The food is great too but i prefered to snacking on the appetizers they have to offer like the artichoke dip. The only thing i would say was a problem was the fact that u almost have to always make a reservation if you want a table during the weekends but other than that this place rocks!"}
{"text":"One of the Best Mother's Day ever, 5 planes today! We got to watch them take off!! Soo AMAZING! Thank you for your sevice and making my Mothers Day wonderful! The service was great and the food was wonderful! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great beer, and good service.  We were able to see the jets taking off and the pilots coming in for a beer after their flights.  Very cool place.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a good hamburger and a beer. Plus the windows look out on the tarmac. Great time watching planes land and take off."}
{"text":"Beers were good, food was average, service was average... was hoping we'd love this place. I got Lilly's salad, it was really good and filling. Kids meals were so-so and a little overpriced, husband had French dip, it wasn't great and he paid extra for sweet potato fries and got very few . Waited for refills. We may come again."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent beer! Bought a keg for my in house kegerator a few weeks ago and just found that they have a restaurant near me. Brought the whole family out to give it a shot. A little hard to find at first because they just have a small sign. Place looked busy but we didn't wait long. I had the carnita tacos, wife had the tortilla soup and Sonoran hotdog, both kids had cheeseburgers. The service was awesome. My son is a little picky about burgers but he loves this place. Would go back ina heartbeat. Definitely recommend thIs place."}
{"text":"It's cool having the restaurant right on the airport. I especially like the Bang Bang burger. Samantha is nice."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner.  I can't say enough about how good everything was.  From greeting at door, wait staff, food and great beers!  This will be a new addition to our food places.  I had the Southwester burger, onion rings and Raspberry beer.  Burger was cooked just how I wanted.  Onion rings!!!!!  I've never had better.  The coating was so light.  The beer!  Holy Molly.....It was almost like drinking a raspberry iced tea. Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"I like this place!! BUT it doesn't have corn tortillas yes food is good but if your gluten intolerant your out of luck seriously tacos without corn tortillas????"}
{"text":"So for airport food this is five star for sure. Really good burgers and fries. Also, the two ladies working in the afternoon on 3/6 were really really awesome. Great customer service, you'd have thought you were at a five star steakhouse."}
{"text":"A great place and neat idea at the Mesa Gateway airport. . overlooking the run way with Superstitions in the back ground. Fresh beer great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a pilot and we absolutely love this place. The best part about it is Astrid. She is always attentive, friendly, funny and quick. She also gives great recommendations on beers to try. Nowadays, we only come here to see my favorite bartender Astrid. She makes the experience 5 stars. Unfortunately, I haven't seen her lately at Barrio's and that makes me sad. If she's not there, I don't eat there or grab drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great place - definitely a bit out of the way - which makes it great for those of us who would want this to be \"our\" place to go in Gilbert.  Great beer and even better pub grub.  Gone there with a crowd and gone there alone - always a great time."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  Matt the manager and AMANDA are so cool. Great at explaining the menu and beer choices. They have a very unique atmosphere.   If your a pilot or aviation enthusiast this is def a place for you.  Incredible food and always a great view watching planes inside or outside on their outdoor patio"}
{"text":"The facility is great! Games outside, nice patio, inside is okay. Not too kid friendly, but I guess enough to say they are kid friendly. We sat down, waiter took our drink order, 8-10 minutes later we got our waters, placed our orders, and over 40 minutes later our food had not arrived, flagged our waiter down a couple of times, and after acknowledgement, he went to the kitchen and came out to attend other customers. Finally, we got up and left, we tried to speak to someone but no one was in sight for me to speak to about the service. Very disappointmentand will probably not return."}
{"text":"Had a nice beer and pretzels while waiting to pick up someone at the airport. The pretzels were on the bland side with a tasty horseradish mustard. We also got cheese on the side but probably didn't need it. We thought maybe it could have been Costco frozen pretzels. It also took a long time to make. However that said, the wait staff were all really warm and friendly. Didn't have other food so can't give a full review. But go grab a beer !"}
{"text":"I love their beer! I like the ambiance! Flights are a little pricy! I could have had three full size beers for the price of the flights..and small glasses! Caution: good customer service is paramount to a successful business. Customers should be acknowledged relatively quickly!! Even if busy, at least show me you know I've arrived!!"}
{"text":"good food ice cold beer service little slow but it's a new location. will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Last night was hands down the Best experience we've had at Barrio's. We live nearby and have been here several times. The first time was horrendous and the food and service were lacking but our waiter apologized and gave us wooden nickels and a BOGO lunch card to give them another try. We went back again a few more times with some being better than others. Last night when we entered the bar, we noticed a sign that stated 'Seat yourself where you'd like'. Fantastic!! (Last time we among other customers waited, what felt like forever to be seated by the unfriendly hostess) We were greeted by our waitress, Samantha who was friendly, energetic and eager to recommend some beers. Whaaat?!? This is the kind of server we have been waiting for- give her a Raise!! She was super attentive and I only wish I'd asked what her shifts were so we knew when to dine here. The cook was also on point as I always get a burger here and in the past I've had to ask them not to grill my bun because it always came out burnt but this time it was perfect and I loved the side salad. The ranch I could drink by itself it's that good. Great experience and we'll definitely be back. Kudos to Barrio's for making the necessary changes needed."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Right on the airstrip, decor inside is simple yet industrial. The beers are delicious and so is their food. They also have cornhole outside to play in the grass. This has quickly become one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Another nice new addition to the Gilbert/Mesa area with Barrio's new opening at the airport. The location is a bit odd, sitting very close to the terminals at Mesa Gateway. But, you can't complain about sitting back and watching planes over a beer and some grub!  The building itself is nice, very clean, and a simple but spacious layout. The bartender, Tyler, was very attentive and gave us some good info on the opening, knowing that it was our first time there. I was there on a  Tuesday afternoon, and was fortunate to hit happy hour. 1/2 price apps and $1 off beers from 2-6 I believe. We ordered pretzels and some chips with (rather bland) guac. The next trip will have to involve the serious part of the menu. Some of the burgers sounded awesome. I had the Beach Ale, which will work quite nice in the summer months. I also had the ruby red- grapefruit IPA which was a good brew also. They had about 10 on tap, with an NCAA Ale (10.4) packing the biggest punch. If it wasn't Tuesday afternoon, I would have downed a few of those. I now sit a short Uber ride, and about halfway between, Barrio and 12 West. I will be happy to support these places as great neighborhood bars!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I fell in love with this place!  The food is great, the beer exceptional, and what a great way to spend time but to watch activity on the tarmac at Gateway airport. Try this place!  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Visited Barrio a few weeks ago with my parents and had an amazing experience. Can't tell what I love more the food, beer or the service. Our server was Astrid and she took excellent care of us. She made sure our drinks were always filled and was calm through the busy dinner rush. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"We have come to Barrio often. We went in today for Fathers Day lunch.   Not surprised there was a wait and they were busy. I was absolutely astonished by the rude people and the comments that people were making about having to wait.   We ordered a drink and sat on the patio to enjoy the planes and weather until our table was ready with our three kiddos.   The staff did apologize for the wait and breathed a sigh of relief as we did not tear them down or treat them with disrespect.   Thank you Barrio for the great beer, great food and great service!!   We are not pilots, but my son does love planes so we will be back again"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. It's a really great restaurant located in a slightly remote area, which adds to the appeal for me. It's located within the Mesa Gateway Airport and there are window seats with view of the runway and planes. Off in the distance are the beautiful Superstition Mountains. It's an amazing view. Customer service here is always great. Everyone is extremely friendly, helpful, and fast. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor seating includes bar seating and high top versus normal table seating. The restaurant is always clean and well maintained. Their menu is full of amazing burgers. I love their burgers!!! I haven't had a change to try anything else yet because I am making my way around the burgers. There is something about the burger buns that has me addicted. Of course, they have a huge beer selection, but I am not a beer fan so I haven't tried any of them. They do have some TVs and the noise varies greatly depending on how many people are there. I have always been seated immediately every time I come so the wait is minimal to none."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time the food was horrible and gave it another chance tonight. My son's med rare burger was well well done...burnt to a crisp. My panini was missing the mayo spread so it was dry and the fries were WAY over salted. Our waiter was non existent. Our appetizer came out and then 30 seconds later came our food. All the waiter could say was, oh well, you never know with the kitchen. The beer is good but the food is bad. Sorry, I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Excellent place to stop with a fine selection of beers and a good selection of pub food that is very tasty. The atmosphere is great overlooking the Airport runway. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow! That food was fabulous! John ordered the Rueben with beer battered fries and I ordered some mushroom mozarella pesto dish with a Ceasar salad it was All delicious! The service was great and the view of the runway along with thr superstions was the best!"}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite brewery!!! We sat down at the bar and we're immediately greeted with a sample of beer! The staff is incredible and beer is even better! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Shuffle board, food, house brews and aircrafts of sorts?   Yes!  I have started to hold off a bit on reviewing upon first visit on the local spots. Our first trip in was awesome! Though we did wait a little while before being seated I'm practicing patience and that's all I'm going to mention about that.   I went with the Peggy O with coleslaw and the man ordered the Pastrami with onion rings. We each had a blonde on our first round, I went with the Blood Mary (Deep Eddy) for the second.   The food...I really enjoyed my veggie burger! I was trying to figure out if they're made in house because it certainly didn't taste like a Boca burger to me. My slaw was different and evidently made in-house. No complaints on my end. The man? Not completely impressed with the pastrami sandwich. We read the menu and it definitely sounded superb. However, he felt that the pastrami was difficult to eat and not nearly as tender as described. Each bite resulted in a majority of his meat coming off the sandwich. The onion rings were good. The waitress was attentive and kind. The Bloody Mary had some spice to it! That salt around the rim is no joke!  While we were dining there were a few Air-force guys eating lunch. We got lucky enough to watch them prepare their jets and then take off. It's really a cool spot and was something different from the norm.   We headed back there a few weeks later. Were seated much more quickly and still had the same friendly service we had previously had. This time I skipped eating and just went straight for the beers. My guy got the spinach artichoke dip, I had a taste and man was it good! Admittedly, I prefer to each my dip with bread but that's just a personal preference since I've noticed they usually always come with tortilla chips. The tortilla chips were light and crisp. The dip was topped with tomatoes, black olives, cheese, green onions. I felt it was a good consistency whereas he thought there weren't nearly enough larger chunks of artichoke throughout.   We will certainly be back again and again. Such a great place!"}
{"text":"We open tabled it and showed up about 30 minutes early at 5:11 on a Wednesday.   No biggie.  Except we never were checked in on the open table app.  Meh...not a big deal, but that's kinda the idea, right?  Our server was also the barkeep, who was waaaaay behind the power curve with an entire bar full of people and getting beers and beverages for the dining room, which was packed.    We ordered a mixed drink and a beer.  It took next to the next week to get those.  We were apologized to by our server/barkeep and yet there appeared to be zero rush.  We ordered chips and salsa to keep ourselves entertained as we figured it would be a long dinner and HH.  We were right.    2 hours and 30 minutes later we got the bill.  We had 3 beers, 1 mixed drink, chips and salsa and a meal. The burgers were good but nothing to write home about.     Service was good...when he was around.  He apologized about it being March and spring break and baseball and whatnot.  Uh that doesn't add up   I've lived here for 32 years and never seen such poor service and the excuse given about March.  That was a new one.    Our server tried hard but I think we were his only table versus the bar and he just forgot about us because he was so busy at the bar.  I can't blame him, however he should've asked for help.   Wednesday?  March?   5:00-7:00?   Cmon man!     The beers were ok, not epic but I'm a beer snob and love IPAs.  Strong big huge IPAs.    Worth a try here and maybe I'll go back to Give it another whirl."}
{"text":"After a miserable experience at Applebees and Village Inn in which we walked out of both because of poor service, we found Barrio. As soon as we walked in the bartender greeted us and brought us menus. The server was a little slow to take our order but brought our beers out right away.  The cheeseburger was good, juicy, with the right amount of condiments. The fries were okay. The bun was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area and had no idea this place was here until my wife heard about it and wanted to try it out. It's located just north of the airport in a warehouse looking building. The signage could definitely be better, but once you find it, the amazing food and drinks will make you forget it was hard to find. They have a pretty extensive beer menu. I had the Java Stout and the porter. Both were great, but the java stout was definitely the better of the 2. Imagine a Guinness with coffee flavor. It was delicious! The porter flavor was outstanding, but after drinking the java first, the sharp carbonation bubbles in the porter were a bit much. For food we started off with the artichoke spinach dip. Holy cow was that tasty!! For my main meal I had the house ruben, which was also amazing! Service was absolutely outstanding! Our waitress, Summer, checked on us every few minutes to make sure we were doing ok. I'm so glad we found this place and will definitely be spreading the word!"}
{"text":"The official entrance is from the outside... Didn't realize this until I visited the restroom. Also, no real changing station for babies. We used to come here when it was the breakfast/lunch spot (miss that place!). The service was a bit slow (it's pretty new so maybe they are working out the bugs). Servers were friendly though. Food was good, served quickly. I had the bang bang burger I think it was called? The only complaint on the burger was that the bread was huge! It's like a giant sweet roll (tasy) but too much. My daughter got the grilled cheese - the cheese wasn't all melted and didn't cover the bread completely but was ok. Hubby had a burger and enjoyed it along with the beer battered fries. I wish they'd left a bit of the old decor up (lots of planes) but not shocked they didn't. Next time I'll try a beer!"}
{"text":"Great local brewery and menu items are delicious. We have been here several times and also take visiting family to this location."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is usually great and the beer is decent. I'd say my only real gripe is that it seems like every time I visit, there's some private party that has half the bar cordoned off and everyone else is pinned in the remainder. Not a big deal, but their space isn't gigantic, so you really feel the crunch on space. Maybe look into getting some additional space for a PDR so it doesn't affect your regulars. I don't begrudge them their success, but it can be frustrating at times.  Keep an eye on your tab too. One particular bartender always seems to be making \"mistakes\". I'm still on the fence whether it's intentional or not but when it happens several times consecutively, you start to wonder."}
{"text":"The California Burger was AMAZING!!! Came here with my pilot friends and we are definetly returning. The staff is great, the food is great, Barrio Brewing is just a great great place. My friends and I enjoyed our time here. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep trying to come here. Every time, it is infuriating. Last time, our food took nearly an hour to come to our table when I went for lunch with my two kids on a weekday. Today, we tried to go for father's day lunch. When we arrived, the two hostesses walked away from their stand after we walked in without greeting us or saying anything. After waiting 10 minutes for them to return, we gave up and left because we had no idea when they would be back. The food and beer is good, but the only way to come here is if you eat at the bar because the bartenders are the only ones who make things happen at a reasonable pace.   Actually, I remember why we keep trying to eat here. Because my husband is a pilot and my son is obsessed with airplanes. I guess next time they want to look at planes while they eat, I will drive through Burger King and come sit at the picnic tables."}
{"text":"The carne Asada burrito was very good and large we also had eggs and bacon with hash browns nice and crispy also had a Bloody Mary also a very good drink service was excellent and very attentive will be back to try lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"So normally I would never give such poor reviews but man after the week I've had,  I have to write this. Came in for lunch as it was close to school. Should of asked the people at school to see where to go instead. As it was lunch ordered wings and pesto chicken sandwich.  Hard to mess up right?  Was catching up on the day and when the wings came out I thought hmm.... good sized wings. I asked for them dry. So I could try all the sauces. And they were ok. Two were very similar.  So now I'm eating and chatting and then look down half of the wings were raw on the inside. Ugh.... now I'm disgusted and tell the waitress.   No apologies..... nothing..... like it happens all the time!!!!!   We paid and left and as you can imagine... not long after the circus comes to my stomach. And man it's been a hell of a ride.  I've finally come out of it and am posting this as a warning to all. Don't do it!!!"}
{"text":"View was amazing watching all the planes. Atmosphere was good and the beer was great.  Food was okay at best"}
{"text":"The burger buns are the best. Big burger and the bun stays with it but not too much dough. Perfect.   Bun from start to finish and no mess."}
{"text":"The food was good on time and the beer was great would have received 5 star s until I got my bill, 12 dollars for 4 4 oz samples!!! Wish there menu or waitress let me know that before I proceeded to try all there beers in flight form . Currently 12 by the way. That's 36 dollars for roughly 4 beers! Wtf . DO NOT ORDER FLIGHTS!!! Just pay the extra 20 bucks and get full size it's triple the amount of beer."}
{"text":"I recently went to Barrio Brewery on a whim chance when we were looking for mid afternoon lunch/dinner after a long day at a dog park. I obviously went to Yelp looking for suggestions, and this beauty popped up. Now, I will break this down so you can choose what to focus on.   Service: Now this was an awesome point for me. I see many reviews who've had negatives, but for me I can't complain. I called in asking first and foremost if we could sit outside as I had my dog with us. We took another car, so I couldn't leave her in the back of the truck. They reserved one table for us outside, and asked everyone if it was ok first. So this was a nice, touching part. As for the service throughout the meal, it was as good as it gets. Attentive, nice, informative, and relaxed, couldn't of asked for anything more.  Food: Now I was shocked as far as the food goes. This place is smaller in size, and right next to the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. So, it's not  as big as some of the other breweries here in Phoenix. I was extremely happy with the food I got. I ordered the Green Chile Chicken Panini, and it was good. I wasn't a fan of the one piece of green chile that was inside, but it was easy to pick out. I ordered the beer battered fries, WHICH IS A MUST. But it is an upcharge, so keep this in mind. I also ordered the Barrio Blonde, and it was amazingly smooth and tasty. They have flights to try their different beers, so I would recommend that for sure.  Overall: I was happily surprised by everything during this visit. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for something reasonably priced, great beer, and welcoming service. Now the inside didn't look huge, so make sure to call ahead for seating if you're going to bring a larger party. We will be returning to this location, as it is almost a hidden gem for us. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"When we first started coming here 5 months ago it was great. Service, beer and food. The last 3 times the service has been horrible. From 10min waits just to get acknowledged to be seated to 15-20min before someone ackowledges you once seated. It had been a couple months since last time so thought one last try as we really want to like this place. Walk in 10min to be acknowledged for seating. That was after we just walked in and started to seat ourselves. The gentleman said he would be right back with menus. 15min later we walked out as no menus or even ackowledged again. Not busy, the gentleman was just behind the bar talking. Sorry last try. Good luck."}
{"text":"First time there today.....great place to watch planes , great atmosphere and get a great brew....our server, Justin was amazing and mad our stay more enjoyable. He did not rush us, suggested what to try and was knowledgeable about the product.  We will be back for food next time."}
{"text":"Fun place. Pretty good beer selection, service is okay. Burgers are pretty good but tend to be undercooked (at least last couple times we went). They are quick to fix it though so still would recommend!"}
{"text":"Beer is great, food service is a bit slow, but don't order the wings.  This was my third run on the wings and they are always cold.  I figured it out, their sauce is cold so as soon as they put it on the wings they lose their temperature."}
{"text":"Loved the idea of a brewing company inside of an airport. Especially, when you are able to go there without even flying anywhere or going through security check-lines. The location is perfect. If you are lucky enough to get a seat by a window you will be able to see planes take-off and land while you eat. The beer is top notch. I tasted almost everything they had on tap and I enjoyed everything. I usually go more towards IPA's so I settled on Citrazona, which is a great go to for me. I ordered the wings, spinach and artichoke dip, and The Phoenix sandwich. The wings were quite good, especially with the halbanero sauce. The spinach and artichoke dip was so-so, not the worst, but definitely not the best. The Phoenix is where they really shined. The chicken sandwich was perfectly cooked and very moist. From the bread to the chicken it was delicious. The service was pretty good as well. Perfect happy hour spot as it is Monday - Friday 2-7pm. Cant wait to check this place out again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The perfect place to debrief after a flight. The staff is incredibly friendly and the beer is great. Copperhead is mouth-watering. OBTW, Samantha is the Shit!!"}
{"text":"Love having this nearby. I enjoyed the Reuben and they have a great selection of beers. It is cool to watch some of the planes arrive and the atmosphere is great. Wasn't thrilled with their Philly Cheese Steak sandwich but overall the place is great and I'll definitely be venturing that way often."}
{"text":"The most standout part about this location of Barrio Brewing Company is definitely the location, being off the tarmac at the airport is really really cool. When I went we got to see a wide variety of aircraft take off and land which is truly pretty unique for a restaurant, and it's RIGHT there too. After living in Tucson for so long, Barrio Brewing was my go to brewery for their food and most importantly their beer. This location has a very similar menu, but also serves breakfast which is what I had. Our group had a mix of different breakfasts, all of which were good. The first item I ordered was sold out, but I was happy with my second choice. This food is not mind blowing but is just good sound food. They do however, have my favorite stout on this planet, the Mocha Java Stout. I was far more concerned with pounding a few of those suckers down than getting breakfast. With my craving for that wonderful beer taken care of, some solid breakfast and a cool view I was happy."}
{"text":"Barrio opened about 6 months ago and it is located right next to the runway at Mesa Gateway Airport. Nice view of incoming airplanes, They sell their own beer on tap and what I had was good and cold. We found the service to be good and liked the ambiance. We just had onion rings but they were tasty. Plan to go back and give the menu a try in the near future. If you do not know where it is a little hard to find."}
{"text":"Terrible service and when asked why we were leaving.... we get attitude.  Amazing.  Love your beers at beer festivals but won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"First off, if I could give this place less than one star I would.   We decided to give Barrio a try after hearing great reviews from our family. When we walked in we were greeted with a hostess resting her chin on her hand with an unemotional facial expression. The other hostess told us there was a 35 minute wait unless we sat at the bar, which we did. I would have rather waited 75 minutes then have experienced what we did.   When we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't introduce herself- instead she said \"What do you want to drink?\" We ordered water while we decided what kind of beer we should try, she never came back to ask what we would like to drink or eat. A 6 top that probably waited the 35 minutes was able to order drinks, receive them, and put their order in before we were even acknowledged. Also another couple at the bar came 10minutes after us and put their order in before the bartender realized we were still waiting on her.   Every time we needed something we had to get her attention. We only ordered 2 beers and had to get away from the atrocious service. Being in the industry myself I have never experienced such poor operation.   I tried to complain to corporate but they do not have an option where I can contact them. I will never return and will be telling my family about this."}
{"text":"Neat location and atmosphere with a great view. Good beer with extended happy hour so you can save some money on both beer and appetizers. Food was definitely bar food but was of good quality and fresh.  Vanessa took very good care of us and the manager Jeanine greeted us and made a point to talk with us.  Overall we were happy with visit and will definitely come back.  We want to try a couple different beers and some different food items. On this visit we tried the Ruby Red IPA, the southwestern burger and the Lizzy salad."}
{"text":"Great spot for bringing your little ones to watch planes, sometimes fighter jets - take off and land while eating a pretty good breakfast"}
{"text":"Great food again! Everything is good here! Service food, view! Had California burger and hu by had cheese steak. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good food beer and service. Had a sandwich filled with veggies. Fry's perfectly seasoned. Raspberry Ale refreshing for this hot weather.  Sonoran dog good too."}
{"text":"Second time here, and just as happy as our first visit. I'm not a beer conisseur, but i like it, and the food is quite tasty! Pollo Pesto panini and carne tacos... delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome food & beverage (citrazona)!! Extraordinary service!! Celina killed it!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places.  Great views, great brews, great service.  Amanda and Evee are fantastic bartenders that take care of you at all times.  The beer selection is tasty, as well as the food menu items.  Look outside the windows and you'll see everything from private planes, to military jets, to commercial airline aircraft.  And, you have an amazing view of the mountains that are splashed with sunset rays come sundown.  This place is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that took the place of the Flight Deck Cafe. It's right down the street (walking distance) from the main terminal at the Phoenix-Gateway Mesa Airport. I know this place just opened but they need to definitely get it together. The place is clean, open, there is an outside patio area and is kinda of decorated or themed like the old place with airplanes, etc. They still have a few windows you can look out of while you eat and see planes come and go. Our waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be working at this particular time at all. She was more interested in talking with other staff members and checking her phone. It was frustrating that we had to get her attention so we could get our order in. If this place was hopping and busy I could completely understand, but for a Thursday afternoon, it was pretty dead. After our food came out we were all pretty disappointed. The potato skins, easy dish that a lot of bars offer, was filled with not a lot of flavor, bit burnt and skimpy on the filling. There was more of the skin on the outside of the potato then there was actually potato on the inside loaded with nothing. My boyfriend ordered a burger and that too was disappointing. No flavor, the fries tasted like they had been sitting out all afternoon and re-heated, just plain \"meh.\" My sister and my mom split the french dip and that had similar reactions. There was no flavor!! No taste, nothing to it at all. Someone call the flavor fairy, you guys need some help. I unfortunately did not try any beverages to see how their selection was, after all this is a  brewery...... But I like food with my brew and you lost me on the food. After having a \"meh\" experience with the staff and a \"meh\" experience with the food, I had to give this place a \"meh\" rating. I was really hoping it was going to blow me away because it's right across the street from my work. I hope this place can make some adjustments in the future to make customers experiences better, so it can thrive. Good luck!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The owner is very nice and took the time to greet us and talk for a while. The beers are great, the grapefruit is one of our favorites and there is a stout coffee beer that is insane. Bartender makes a good dirty martini too.  Delicious food as well and a good view of the runway."}
{"text":"We always love eating here, they have great food, drinks and service. We love watching the planes take off and land (and so do many others as they come with their personal cameras and ladders!) and it's just an overall great spot to eat, talk and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great new place with awesome views!  We saw a F16 parked with several other private jets with the Superstition Mountains as background- awesome!    We had trouble finding it, which several have also reported, but it's directly across from a big white jet  statue before Ray road.  Outside seating is available with several corn hole games.   The inside is neat /clean with lots of room and a good menu.  We went for happy hour M-F  ($3 drafts and 25% off appetizers)  took first visit to sample several beers and look forward to making this a local favorite!"}
{"text":"It's cool to see how the planes were arriving and departing Drinking a beer (they had a big variety) and good food. Kids friendly"}
{"text":"Barrio Brewing, where can I start!? I really enjoyed this place and will start by saying its five star worthy.  I have been eying this place for awhile and just happened to decide to give it a try recently. I was not disappointed. You have to drive through ASU and the Chandler-Gilbert Community College campus but nestled in the way back is the Mesa-Gateway Airport where you will find Barrio Brewing right off the runway. The location is nice with far reaching views, airplanes nearby, and there is a pavilion with a greenbelt area for the kids to run around, games to play, and just a nice area to walk after dinner or while waiting.   After we were seated on the outside patio, we waited for awhile for our server to get our drink order. It took awhile to get them ordered and to the table where we found we needed just a moment longer to look at the menu. It was quite a few moments before our server showed up to finally take our order. Even after this, there wasn't any follow up with our meal, if we wanted drinks, and felt like she wasn't going to show up with our checks. This wasn't the end of the world but it could have been better (she may have been new?)  We both ordered a drink and I found it was good. I got the Santa Rita Jefeweizen and my buddy got the Copperhead Pale Ale. Both were pretty tasty and just as written. We both ended up ordering the Dianne Burger because it sounded fantastic, as did most things on the menu. I was REALLY torn! (Hoping to come back and give some more things a try.) Overall, the best part of the burger was the freaking BUN! It was seriously so good, I don't know why but we both thought it was excellent. The fries were also on point, get the beer battered ones - you won't be disappointed.   One of the coolest parts was seeing three military jet planes flying over the large airstrip and open area nearby. In the distance you have a great mountain range view. The planes even landed and parked near the brewery, which was loud but pretty cool to see.   Overall, Barrio Brewing Co is worth the visit. Nestled back in the campus and near the airport it is away from the hustle and bustle of a busy business complex. You are backed right up to a large open area with mountain views and the unusual view of the airport runway where you can, hopefully, see some planes jets up in the sky. There is plenty of outdoor space to play corn hole or take a walk before / after dinner to take in the views. The food all looked extremely delicious on the menu. The burgers and beer battered fries are fantastic and the BUNS are the BEST! As mentioned, I think the service was disappointing but I'd give them another shot. Hoping to come back here and leave an updated five star review.   (Unrelated but looking for another great airport food/breakfast place for the kids? Try Hangar Cafe for breakfast in Chandler, AZ. They're affiliated but the theme goes great for kids interested in airports or who enjoyed this place!)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this neighborhood jewel. The word has spread and they do get busy. Food is really done well and they introduce a little something special at least once a month. Their beers are all very tasty and they have added quite a lot of cocktails and wine to the line up. Astrid was behind the bar tonight (she is a delight) Matt bends over backwards to make sure everyone is having a great experience. Games, tv's and family friendly and don't forget the fighter jets. All of their servers try so hard, Samantha and Amanda are wonderful as well. This has become our weekly living room. Loyal customer for life."}
{"text":"Well... I don't know where to start!!! It is a really cute place at the Williams Gateway airport with a good view of some small planes.   Ordered food and server was ok, but it took forever!!!! Finally arrives and onion rings are still not even done. Ranch was like water...  My extra side salad looked like it was sick!!! Moms sandwich looks like they forgot to actually put meat on it! My chicken pesto was flavorful at least. I mean for a $12 sandwich they were small!!   Time to pay... their machines are down... well how many people travel with $50 cash to pay the tab. i only carry my debit card. They came back and told us two times it didn't work... ummm should I stay all day in hopes of your machine working. Not my fault so we are leaving. Obviously meal was for free which was good because if I had to pay that it was painful!   I look over at what I believe was the owner and some friends side salad, the same one I WAS supposed to get... well clearly different standards! Check the food quality coming out of the kitchen and make sure it is the same for Everyone... not just looking good for the Higher ups!!!!"}
{"text":"Please try this place, you won't regret it! Great find I came across a few weeks back and we've been in 3 times since then!  Each time we've come in it's been outstanding customers service by servers which included Micheal from our first time dining in.  This place opened in May of this year. Their main location is in Tucson. Home brews on tap- excellent. Many to choose from. Growler deals and happy hour special from 2-7 PM every weekday.  Food is really good. Burgers are a must. My husbands favorite is the Western with an over easy egg on top ( you have to request it). The Dianne burger was great which I had. Kids meal are a perfect fit for the littler appetites. Plus, not to mention the amazing distraction & view out the window with all the aircrafts on the field.   Salads are exceptional. The presentation is great & the plates are chilled prior to serving \"genius\" this insures a very crisp, fresh arrival. That was a big plus! The Lizzie Salad is very popular and I can see why. The dressing is made in-house with fresh basil. It's outstanding!  There is a great patio to dine outside as well & a covered centered gazebo area. They also have several corn hole games stationed throughout the lawn area in front.  I have to say; this is our \"new favorite\" and we will become regulars.  Come by- try this joint it won't disappoint. Support our local establishments. I really hope to see this place succeed.   During the day it's a wonderful lunch location and they offer some good specials. Prices are reasonable and servers are so welcoming.   At night fall it's just as pleasant seeing the planes & the restaurants atmosphere light up. You can even go out, sit on the benches they have that surround the property & just view all the beautiful scenery too!   NOTE- Taco Tuesday Deals that can't be passed. Call ahead for details!"}
{"text":"Brought our dogs as the weather got cooler.. and have visited a few times. I wanna keep my great place secret but I can't NOT say how great and flexible the staff is. My absolute favorite place with or without pups! I'll add to this later- I'm here now and want to enjoy more"}
{"text":"Nice place to relax, watch planes come and go, have a beer and eat.  Had the corned beef sandwich which was very good with onion rings.Some corned beef can be really chewy...this was very tender.  Had the porter which was also very good."}
{"text":"First time to this joint. Met a few friends at the bar area tonight for a drink and bite to eat. I had a good time. Brews were good, food was good, service was too. Kind of odd being at the airport. Was a little difficult to find on our way here, however, a cool spot nonetheless. Check it out. Ask for Astrid. She is the $#!t."}
{"text":"I feel like the only way I can describe this place is \"eh\". It wasn't awesome. It wasn't terrible. I had the carne tacos and they were okay. I did come in fairly late at night, about an hour or so before they closed so I know that's kind of when everyone is starting to pack up to leave and I should expect a little less. Either way, the steak for the tacos was tough and not nearly enough. I was just pretty underwhelmed.   It also took close to half an hour for our food to get out which is bit confusing when there are only 6 other people in the place. Just an underwhelming experience in general. It being so close to the airport and having a view of the planes is cool though. Might have been the highlight of the experience."}
{"text":"Food is great for Brewery food.  Atmosphere is excellent with the planes outside and corn hole to pay."}
{"text":"One star is generous. We ordered our drinks and it took too long for them to arrive. Our food order took twice as long to arrive and the food arrived at separate times and my husbands order took an additional 15 minutes to arrive. I ordered the Asian chicken salad and it was lettuce with a few slivers of carrots and lunch meat chicken. Over priced and the attention from the servers was poor and an equally poor attitude. I will not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a cool little place. Burger was huge. A little over cooked. Service was attentive. The best part was watching the planes take off and land. Got to see two jets take off. They have outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"Before Barrio Brewery came in, this site use to be a restaurant that served breakfast and early lunch that drew the older crowd with a smattering of motorcyclists. They had a really cool setup of model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. I was really bummed when they closed their doors but my interest piqued again when I saw that a brewery was coming in its place. I'm really disappointed to say I'm not a fan of the Barrio brews (and I love microbrews!). I had some samples but ultimately settled on ice tea. The food was okay, not the best either.   The only part I appreciate about the site is being able to see the planes come and go and admire the ones sitting on the tarmac. But you can do that outside on the grassy knoll if you don't want to come inside the brewery."}
{"text":"I work at Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airport, where this Barrio is located. The staff is always friendly. The food is delicious. Great craft beer and a good view of the flightline if you are an aviation buff. We had a bunch of my old pilot training classmates and spouses there for lunch this past Saturday. Matt and David and the staff were very helpful and accomodating! I had the Pulled Pork sandwich - tasty."}
{"text":"Food is brewery food. The fun is in watching planes land and take off. Service is spotty. May be good - may not. Your appetizer will likely arrive at the same time as your dinner. The battered fries aren't all that great and good luck getting ketchup. The noise level is ridiculous. You can't hear the person next to you. Take a page from the Hangar Cafe at KCHD and serve good food and let us enjoy the atmosphere. Go to the Farm Grill for good food and watch the planes from the free benches."}
{"text":"Went with my boys on father's day and got seated right away.  We ordered the fire starter burger, cheese burger, and the hangar (breakfast). It was delicious. I had the firestarter (burger with jalapeno bacon and grilled jalapenos). It was juicy, spicy, and thick. The fries were standard fare. My 11 year old had the cheeseburger and said it was one of the best he'd ever had. My older boy had the hangar (biscuits and gravy covered chicken tenders with scrambled eggs).  He scarfed it all. His one complaint was it didn't appear to have 2 eggs as advertised. He said it was more like half of 1 egg. I would have given 5 stars if the service was better. It was a bit slow and took a long time to get more water or the side of ranch.  I'll be back to try one of their other burgers. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great fun place to check out with its location and the airport.  A lot easier to get to than I thought.  No issue with airport traffic as it's located farther down from the main terminal.  So plenty of parking.  I had the Amber beer, cause I like Ambers and was happy with it.  Food was good too.    Had fun watching the big rain storm there as well.    Plan to come back again to watch the planes and have another beer or two."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop if you have to make the journey from Phoenix to Mesa to pick someone up at the airport. However, DO NOT order a flight. I got a pint for $4 and then wanted to sample some other stuff so opted for a flight, that was inexplicably $12.   A pint is 16 oz and $4. Yet a 4 x 4oz flight is $12? Just makes no sense. Beer was decent though."}
{"text":"I like this place for happy hour, but I truly do not understand why this place isn't slammed for brunch on the weekends. They have mimosas, Bloody Marys, great beer and an awesome view of the runway. The food is pretty standard, but the view of the runway, great service and good beer make this place worth the drive."}
{"text":"Cool place, laid back. Nice scenery watching the planes take off. I tried 4 different beers and liked them all. I liked the beach beer the best and its not on the menu. I had a Sonoran dog and it was really good. Staff was also very friendly. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Although it's not the most convenient location, this place is worth the drive! There's a great selection of beer and the food is much better than your average brewery grub. The spinach and artichoke dip really is beyond delicious! If you happen to come in on a day she's working, Astrid is by far our favorite bartender!! She is extremely friendly and is always able to find the perfect beer to pair with my food. Sadly we haven't seen her in awhile but we're hoping she'll be behind the bar next time we're in."}
{"text":"This place is the place to be when on the east side of Phoenix! Friend, family, dog(patio only), all are welcome! Great food and beer!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's our go to restaurant. Good atmosphere, great food and friendly staff makes this one of our favorite dine out spots. Enjoy watching the planes come and go."}
{"text":"Great place and good food although service is a bit slow. We've been there numerous times and it hasn't gotten any faster unfortunately"}
{"text":"Wish this place could strike balance between good service & good food! Beer is great. Disappearing waiter, not knowledgeable of specials posted in FB, food missing sauces and overdone burgers need to be addressed by Mgt"}
{"text":"Picked up some friends at the terminal and stopped in here to get a quick meal. We requested the patio and were seated with no wait. The waitress took our drinks order and we had waters within a few minutes. I had a burger and fries that were very tasty, and another had onion rings that were wonderful. For being at an airport, the prices are very reasonable, and my wife enjoyed the house chardonnay. I will definitely be back! Also, love the cornhole boards in the grassy area!"}
{"text":"Water tasted horrible.  Out of options if you don't drink soda or beer.  One of our meals came out 15 minutes after the others.  Service was slow.  Manager adjusted off the late meal.   Stay away from the althea sandwich.   Burger was good. Second time to this place and second miss.   There won't be a third."}
{"text":"Really yummy food and cool atmosphere - it's at the airport (Phoenix Mesa Gateway) and you literally look out of the window at the planes. Because of this, they've decorated with a plane theme - but contemporary. If just feels good to be there. Love the atmosphere.   NOTE: You don't go into the airport or deal with airport parking. I almost did because my GPS was vague. If you feel like to are going to the airport, go north a bit and you'll be fine.  I would suggest taking anyone here but especially those who are into planes and jets. I have no idea about these things but it's fun to sit with someone who does and hear them talk about the dudes in military jump suits and what their planes are called. What I'm getting at is that it's a laid back and fun place to take the husband, ladies. (And the plane loving ladies too) Plus who can argue with a burger?   VEGAN OPTIONS: 1. Veggie burger with no cheese and no sauce WAS REALLY YUMMY. Called the Peggy-oh or something. I love a good veg burger and this was great. Not like an afterthought like a lot of places with their vegan choices.  2. Touch of Grey - mushroom and veg sandwich  3. Beer sponges - pretzels and mustard"}
{"text":"Beer was fabulous well done the food program need work!!!! I like the airport idea as well"}
{"text":"I was excited to give this place a try! I am always in the mood for a new fresh local beer, which they had. We arrived at about 630, no wait, seated immediately. Cool vibe they have a bunch of TV's around the seating and bar area. The location is cool, it's right next to the Mesa airport. The reason i gave it only 3 stars was the food, we only had chips and salsa which tasted awful. I would've ordered more but i was too scared. Ill go for the beer but not the food."}
{"text":"Great and unique location and it seems to be pretty popular. Their quesadillas are BOMB - must try."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and a bite. This was the second time I came and brought some friends to try it out too. Everyone's food was good although I think the jalapeño bacon was missing from my Firestarter burger. The burger was very tasty without it though and I didn't want to complain. A friend had the veggie burger and said it was very tasty. My only gripe is that we like to sit outside on the patio and the music is loud...... a little lower would be nice when talking to friends. So far I like this place and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great night at Barrio Brewing sat at the bar and we were helped by Soriah who was awesome - I had a veggie burger with roasted jalapeño really good stuff - loved the onion rings that were not the greasy kind - had two beer flight - most of my 8 5oz tastes were excellent - liked the RoJo the best - My wife had the touch of grey - a little greasy, but great flavor - loved our first visit on a busy Saturday night - will be back for more."}
{"text":"Terrific burgers, awesome service, and wonderful atmosphere to watch all kinds of aircraft. This place is a gem for Mesa. So much fun to just hang out here."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed sitting on the patio with our dog and drinking a few excellent brews! Hubby had a burger  the black & blue as it was Cajun & blue cheese . It came out thick but cooked to -order. The French fries that came with were as nice as fries get ! My salad was huge and I throughly enjoyed the House made basil-vinegarette dressing *^ Second visit ! Just as good ! This time we sat at the bar and got great service! The beer here is so good!!! Just worth every penny ! Great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Came in an hour before closing on a Tuesday night so it was just us and the employees. We sat at the bar and were greeted by our server/bartender.   What we loved the most about her was that she was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their history and products. I love hearing fun facts about the places I'm eating/drinking at.  The food was fresh despite the hour we came in at and it was very delicious. Will be back for some more food and beer! Maybe a growler or two ;)"}
