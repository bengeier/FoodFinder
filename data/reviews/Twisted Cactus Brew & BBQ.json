{"text":"Best beef brisket I have ever had.  Tender, great flavor. My husband had the grilled cchicken sandwich, which was also excellent. Friendly, attentive service. We are visiting from out of town, but if I'm ever back in Chandler, would put this place on the top of my list."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for burgers, brisket & beer. We come here almost weekly!"}
{"text":"While they are presently still waiting for their license to serve their namesake beer, their food menu is great! I can't wait to try their beers when they are able to serve them. The local beers they keep on tap are still great choices. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer.... tasted the Papago Orange Blossom and our whole group was hooked!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger with Poblano Chiles and the sides (fries and coleslaw) were delicious as well! Great selection of beers on tap and the service was excellent! We will be back for sure! Nice little hidden gem"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and some of the best burgers in town. Well worth a try and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I just had the cowboy up burger & it was perhaps the best hamburger I've even had.  They said they use grass fed local beef which is a big plus for me also.  The combination of some think lightly fired onions, bbq sauce with lettuce/tomato on a fresh bun gave this great taste.  I'll definitely come back with my friends.  I also chose a side salad instead of fries.  It was large with fresh cucumbers, tomatoes & mixed fresh greens & as good as one would get in a fine restaurant."}
{"text":"We were excited about a brewery opening down the street from our home, but our visit tonight was close to terrible. With only 4 tables of guests, the service was shockingly slow. We were told multiple times the food would be out soon and after over a hour of waiting on a Thursday evening our food arrived. The owner shared he would discount the food while we were waiting. Of the three burgers we ordered (medium well, medium and medium rare) all were over cooked and burned. We hope this place can survive, but doubtful after leaving with full meals on the table. At least the beer selections were good."}
{"text":"This place is great! Excellent food, wonderful service and their twisted cactus IPA was so good (and I don't generally like IPA's) I highly recommend stopping by. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great local brews! Although the menu is limited, what they serve up is really tasty!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes to find a neighborhood watering hole. The bartender was very attentive. I found their house IPA pretty unremarkable. Same for the beer bites. It seems they have sort of an identity crisis in their decor. Like random pics and Hobby Lobby type bar/beer signs.
There was a dude who seemed like the owner. He made a joke about people asking if they had Coors Light and upon learning they didn't carry it just went for water. We all sort of laughed but the irony was not lost on me that the biggest beer sign in the places was... you guessed it, Coors Light.
I hope we got a bad batch of IPA and that otherwise people flock to this seemingly mom & pop place."}
{"text":"Great little local beer place, great food options and friendly staff.  Support your local small business and check em' out! We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful lunch and dinner place!  The hamburgers are amazing and there's a good selection of craft beer.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So glad to see a good bar/restaurant back in this space. The local beer selection is fab! Can't wait to try their own brews when those are ready. Service is excellent and good is good (what we've tried so far). Yay."}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing house IPA. Really, really nice people. Great burgers and homemade sauces."}
{"text":"Decided to try Twisted Cactus on a recommendation from a friend. Its a small quaint place with a bar, 7 tables, and a few Tv's to watch sports. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. 
We started with the poutine fries as an appetizer. The plate came with a lot of fries and meat. It was very flavorful but I would have prefdered to have a little more gravy.
My son had the cowboy burger which he said was very tasty and came with about a half pound of fries.
I had the brisket and pork bbq. Good flavor and the potatoes salad was creamy and delicious. I would recommend this to anyone. $$

This will be my hidden gem when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, great ambience, great food and good prices. Wish their menu was a little bigger but I understand their a new business! It's walking distance from our house so that's a huge bonus ;) We love supporting local businesses so we will definitely be back multiple times!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for only five months and will probably be open forever as long as they keep making great food.  The server behind the bar was really cool and kept checking on me.  I had the ribs/brisket combo with slaw & beans.  All of it was amazing.  Trip back? Absolutely!  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Truffle fries, burger and brisket sandwich were all really good. We will be back to try more of the menu"}
{"text":"We've been here several times recently and have enjoyed the food, drinks, people, and neighborhood atmosphere. However, this last time was a poor experience. The Moscow mules tasted like pure soda water and service was all around poor. Giving 2 stars weighted for previous visits and good food but would give this last visit 1 star. With so many quality options in town, I will look elsewhere before returning."}
{"text":"I've been here 4-5 times. Burgers bbq and sides are all high quality. Cowboy burger is my favorite. One reason I keep coming back is they can consistently cook. Med rare burger. Friendly staff, great music and comfy atmosphere. If you want something a little different I'd suggest to check it out."}
{"text":"Awesome place, they have amazing brisket and some tasty ice cold beers made in Arizona"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous, which was a surprise because the restaurant decor and furniture was tired and wobbly. Poor signage so never would have known it was there if hadn't seen a posting on a local group. But the food.... so good!!! Husband had the brisket sandwich and I had the twisted cactus burger. It didn't look like there was enough sauce on my burger but every bite was packed with flavor. Really great!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place.  Killer family business and have the food and brews to back it up.  I normally order the burgers and they're a half-pound in addition cooked to order perfectly every time.  The fries are hand cut and are are to die for.  I've had the BBQ before, it's solid, but not the best I've ever had, so I'll stick to the burgers and beer.  The beer menu is always rotating, so there's no excuse to find something you will like.  Killer service too!"}
{"text":"The place seemed cool and looked slow so we dropped it. It was a very long wait for the food and it was okay. Not at all what I was expecting. And forget about the tap water. One sip and it went to the side. We both had burgers. At least the fries were good."}
{"text":"Loved this place! They're new, but oh so ready to brew and feed you. The clientele was a bit upscale in the early evening, but I wouldn't feel out of place here in a tee shirt and jeans. They are still working up their menu offerings, and I was lucky to get an advanced item the chef called, \"Pambazo\" (pictured). It was amazing! So good, and it went well with the proper Moscow mule. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the best place to come and have a beer and a bite to eat! They have amazing vegetarian options as well! I highly recommend the veggie tacos and the top shelf margaritas. My friend loved the ribs as well! The service is great, the beers are local, and the food is amazing. It is sure to not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Super cute little place!!  We had an assortment of burgers, which were all delicious and well priced.  We also tried the brisket which was very flavorful.  The potato salad, though a small portion, had great flavor.  The only thing that could use a little work was the flavorless cole slaw.  We had 2 sides that we barely touched.  We look forward to trying other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for an early lunch yesterday after the harvest festival. We were the only customers there, so we sat at the bar. The owner greeted us immediately and was very friendly. They have an unfiltered IPA right now that was amazing, even though I'm not usually and IPA person. I had the brisket sandwich and fries and my husband had the smoked pork. We both thought our food was delicious and the conversation was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with the family. Food was great and quick. Excellent burgers and huge chicken tenders for kids. Prices are low considering the quality. Service was excellent very friendly. I would defiantly go back to have a beer to just talk with the staff. Next time."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked BBQ.  Great local beer selection.  Tony was behind the bar and had it popping."}
{"text":"3.5 stars from me - great burger, cooked to a nice medium rare, really enjoyed it. Would have been a nice value but the potato salad that came with it was kind of a tiny portion, served in a little cup. If it were a bit bigger I'd come back for more burgers, or maybe just order fries next time. Service was a bit mixed - great from one person and kind of cold from another, not sure if one or both were the owners. Seems like a good local place with good food and drinks, but not feeling a need to hurry back."}
{"text":"Great little local spot.  An array of local brews & really good food!  And we are foodies with a critical palette!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a couple drinks. Service was great! The guys were really nice and even offered samples. The beers were $5.50 and I had wine for $7 but the pour was generous. The place wasn't empty but wasn't busy either. It was cute, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday and had the bacon bleu burger. It was super delicious - better than I expected - beef was amazing. Staff was friendly and helpful and very accommodating. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! They haven't started brewing yet, but their brewer Steven says they should anytime now! They do have fabulous beers on tap (always changing) along with delicious food! I highly recommend trying the Beer Bites & I always get their Cowboy Up burger, but have also had other meals in the past, & they're always yummy! Highly recommend this place for great beer (nice wine if you like it too), yummy food, and a kick ass atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Hands down the Best Burger in the area. Owners are super friendly and will remember your face. Biggest downfall, which they are new so we hope this gets better, is the service- especially when it's busy-- once we waited over an hour and the waitress when asked still hadn't put in our appetizer order so we left. Although that was a little extreme, our other visits never took that long but also there wasn't as many customers. Still would def recommend during the slower times and the cactus burger is a must try!"}
{"text":"We stopped in and tried this place out last weekend. It was our first time. Under new ownership and they really seem to be hands on. Food was fantastic and they have a good amount of drafts to choose from. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are always looking for a new place for our family to try. The service was great! The burgers are very tasty and the fries are awesome! We brought our young boys and they both ordered a kids meal. Both boys thought the sliders, chicken tenders and fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice local place with good beers on tap, excellent food and friendly service. Definitely recommend the Cuban."}
{"text":"What a great little hidden gem. Comfortable atmosphere and local beers on tap. You can tell that the chef takes great pride in the food he's making for you. I highly recommend the poutine fries. The serving size is great to share with others and the flavors are amazing."}
{"text":"Tried their tacos this evening and Wow! Brisket Tacos were just amazing then someone told me other tacos are even better. Gotta go back. Salsa was authentic."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & Great Service! Alec was awesome!
We're in town from Texas and we know BBQ, eaten it all over. And this place is great. Got the two meat combo (Brisket & Pork) with BBQ Beans (fantastic). Mom got the Ribs, which were freaking fantastic as well. Finished it off with a fried ice cream!!

Good local beer selection, I got the Belgian Wheat, wife got the Cucumber Mule which had great flavor. 

Will definitely be coming back next time we visit family!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough greatness about this place! Amazing service, and a wonderful music selection. 
Delicious drinks. Moscow mule was not too overpowering every flavor perfectly balanced. The on tap ipa was crisp and refreshing with sweet flavors. The lager was bright and smooth.
We were lucky enough to be there Taco Tuesday the smoked pork tacos were full flavored and unaccompanied by a hot homemade salsa.  The brisket taco was also good, but definately the pork is best. The chicken taquitos were Uh-Maze-ing!! Smoked chicken and hand rolled. Crunchy, and moist;the ratio foe tortilla to filling was on point. The truffle fries were bold and salty with perfect notes of flavor nothing too overwhelming.
Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We got there towards the end of the night.  Good beer choices and for what we had (Bomb Burrito and Blue Cheese Burger) was tasty.  The server was nice and we didn't have to ask for refills.  Would go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Went there for lunch today and the brisket sandwich is delicious. Good brews and undeniably some of the best customer service I've seen."}
{"text":"Great brisket. Fun, personable staff. A family-owned business.  Good crat brews. You have to give it a try."}
{"text":"Under new ownership! Everyone is so nice! Great food, great service! Cowboy burger, ribs, poutine fries and fried icecream are all delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I appreciated the presentation, quality and value of their offering. We get so use to eating food that's been stripped of everything and masked in sauce that it's just simply great that a burger like this exists. This is what a burger is supposed to be from top to bottom. Simple, tasty, quality that resonates to the toasted bun from their panini maker. They have it to create a Cuban which I'll try on my next visit. Overall I'm just appreciative that a good burger does exist out there if your not taking a good burger for granted.  Beer needs to be colder. Arizona summer dictates it. That burger with a colder beer, perfection."}
{"text":"First time here tonight for dinner. They were out of the sausage, first sign that it's quality BBQ. No worries, the ribs had a great smoke ring and the sauce is a great pair for the smoke flavor. If you don't like strong smoke flavor, you many want to try the brisket or pulled pork.

I also tried the pulled pork and chopped brisket sliders to get a taste of as much of their bbq as possible. Neither one disappointed, they had enough meat that each one with overflowing and we added the leftover meat to our fries.

Fries were great. Fresh hand cut fries. Hot from the fryer and salted well. 

BBQ beans were below average. Little flavor. I won't order them again.

Our server was amazing! Very attentive, but not a stalker."}
{"text":"Great food and local micro brews. Tried this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Tucked away in the NW corner this place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Adorable! These guys are awesome and they make GREAT food! It's a bit of a limited menu but EVERYTHING was great. We were a party of 18, played softball all day and we're hungry and a bit rambunctious. Our waiter was terrific and dealt with lots of women talking at the same time. Melt the n your mouth ribs, two thumbs up on the twisted cactus burger, margaritas flowed. Moscow mules very very good. Come here you won't regret it! Fresh veggies were very fresh. Ribs outrageous."}
{"text":"Since the bar has changed ownership, there has been a complete 180. Bartenders are friendly and they are usually serving unfiltered IPA. The bbq is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location (in a strip mall) fool you, this is a hidden gem! Get the Orange Bloosm beer - so refreshing! Burgers and fries are outstanding as well. The guys running it were so friendly too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I live near the area and came here a few months ago and thought it was horrible. I heard they had new owners/management and went in for a beer today and it has really improved! They added smoked BBQ which is probably the best I have had in the Phoenix area. They also have beers from new local breweries that were excellent! They don't brew beers yet so the name is confusing, but everything else was great."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! Burgers are very good! All food was good actually and prices were modest. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place does not brew its own beer. It's does serve local craft brews but nothing special. Ordered  the Tower Station IPA and the Blap Blap Belgium Wheat. Also ordered fries that were very soggy and nothing special. Overall unimpressed."}
{"text":"Well, we wanted to check out a local brewery...this isn't a brewery, they dont even brew iced tea. The small beer selection wasn't bad, and the food smelled great, but we just wanted to find a place to have beers and visit with friends. Maybe some outside tables would be good as well."}
{"text":"Delicious brisket,  craft beer and primo wine. Friendly and attentive wait staff, speedy service, and comfortable surroundings. A must stop!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were in town and looking for a fun place to have a beer. This place was perfect! It is fairly new and don't have their own beers on tap, but that just makes us want to come back sooner. They have some great food options and Portland had some pictures of the food to show us, which was a great idea. It was a quiet time of day, but that made our first visit even better. Portland gave some great recommendations and even better conversation. This place is only going to get better and better in the future, a must visit!"}
{"text":"Decent burgers and beer.  Small little place and portions were good sized.Very reasonable price for the burger.  The place was quite empty for 5:30 p.m."}
{"text":"So, I really love the BBQ here. But at the rate they are going, they will be closed in a matter of months. They offer a pretty limited menu and they run out of food constantly! We have gone to the restaurant twice in 4 days and each time, they are out of food. How does that happen? It is only 6:00 in the evening. It's not like we came in at 10 PM. Very frustrating. I give them a 5 for food, a 1 for service (lack of good) so a 2 overall. I want this place to succeed but honesty I wont go out of my way again. If I'm in the area, I might stop in but I wont make it a destination. I would add the bartender working tonight (not one of the owners) was rude and could not have cared less about the situation."}
{"text":"BBQ...and especially the ribs were just so so.  Beers were definitely good to balance it out.  Atmosphere was above average, but if going for food.  They need some help here."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The quality of the food was great. They say it's a half pound burger, not sure about that. The service was a slow. They were also out of a couple of menu items. My husband had their IPA he said it was great he had two.

The prices were reasonable for what you got. This is a father /son establishment, it's small. They did hire a waitress. If you want a good burger and beer, this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"Great bbq, casual atmosphere, local beers and friendly servers. Can't go wrong. They are looking to expand menu. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"Haven't had a burger like this since I lived in NY. I had the cowboy burger. Every single bite was better than the last. Couldn't have left more satisfied. I actually left his joint with a smile on my face cause the burger was so damn delicious. God damn. This review looks fake actually but I swear to you it's not."}
{"text":"I do believe this place is going to be one of our new regular haunts. Excellent food, service, friendliness, atmosphere, and drinks.  We'll be back for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer to check out this new brewery. Very nice small space in a strip mall in Chandler with a couple of tvs, a bar, and 8 or 9 tables. Unfortunately, not able to serve their own beers yet, but soon. As is, they have a nice mix of local and out of state taps. Friendly staff. Bartender offered to let us taste a couple of selections before we chose what to order. Limited food selection. Mainly appetizers and sandwiches. We tried the Cuban sandwich, and it was great. Plentiful ingredients, and the Dijon mustard, rather than typical yellow, really topped it off well.  The side salad we got, rather than fries, was really generous. We don't live close, but will definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Epic fail.  Replaced three kegs while we were there.  Flavor profiles of beer were very strange and overloaded with grapefruity IPAs.  Burgers were most underwhelming we have ever had.  Coleslaw was okay, potato salad about what you would expect out of a plastic container from the grocery store.  I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Just had the Twisted Cactus Burger here. It was perfectly prepared and served by friendly and competent staff. The fries were awesome, slightly larger than shoestring, just as God intended. Three TV's inside so we could catch a little of the Sun Devils game while we ate. Not a huge selection of beer, but a good range of IPA's, ambers, porters and Belgians, and all from AZ. Better get in here before this place is discovered."}
{"text":"Nice small place. I had The Cuban and it was pretty taste. My friend had the Sliders and said they were dry. They do not make their own beer here so I think the name is misleading. Overall nice quite spot to have a cold beer and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"You'll never want another burger after you try this place. 
My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Dropped in to check it out while on this side of town and we were not disappointed.  Nice AZ brews and in house BBQ. Pulled pork, brisket and great ribs. The St. Louis style ribs best I've had in a long time. 

Sides I included hand cut fries and potato salad. Both fantastic ask for the fries crispy. 

Overall we really enjoyed this place. Definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"The absolute best ribs we have ever had. We were a group of ten and everyone loved their meal. The beer selection and service were also all top notch. Give this place a try you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Great burger & homemade fries and a a decent selection of good beers. Good service. I'll definitely stop in again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food was so yummy!  My husband got the Cowboy Up burger and loved it. I got the Black and Blue and was so impressed. Even our picky eater thought the chicken was \"so good\". They have board games to entertain and spend some family time while waiting. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at this quaint neighborhood bar tucked in the corner. Service was superior and bartenders talked to everyone like old friends. Ordered the poutine fries which were great. Also ordered a glass of the Syrah and my boyfriend had a Helio Basin Porter as well as the Papago Orange Blossom. I'm not much of a beer far but the orange blossom was pretty good. Definitely coming back to  taste the additional menu items. Can't wait to try the brisket. Has 4 TVs and enough seating for about 40.  Showing UFC, football and gymnastics.y"}
{"text":"Just left Twisted Cactus Brewing Company and not only did I love the Cowboy burger and their cheeseboard yummy!!! But far more from the food we had so much fun with Alex and our fellow bar mates...we laughed so much!!! OMG so much!!!  Arms down so fun!! You who were there will understand!!!"}
{"text":"To bad I can't give a half  I would give the TCB company a 3.5. Great burgers 8, price 6.5, and I should not have had the Cuban. Good atmosphere fun little place worth a trip. Great local beers."}
{"text":"This place has great food, some of the best service I've ever had, and a great atmosphere!  Board games for the kids, the game on tv and awesome burgers and fries. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The bartender was super nice & knowledgeable of the local breweries & what they offered. I only got fries for food but they were delicious! 
The vibe was chill & casual. Good beer selections. Hopefully they will offer more taps in the future though."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: our server was great! She was super attentive and accommodating.

And now the not so good: Food was \"ok.\" I had the cowboy burger and fries, my wife had the twisted cactus with slaw. My burger was very good, but the fries were limp. My wife's burger was \"bland\" (her words) and the slaw was fresh but \"not that flavorful.\"

At the time of this review, the brewery was not brewing any beer and was instead serving local craft beer, which was disappointing. That being said, the locals they had were good.

Overall: I'll be back if it's someone else's idea. Too many excellent brewery's out there with top notch food and beer for me to spend my limited out to eat budget on \"ok\" food and another gamble on beer their house brews."}
{"text":"We were the first customers through the door and have been back every week since opening unless we have been out of town. TC is a great small family owned business.  The food is great. Everything is reasonably priced and the owners are receptive to customer feedback. One simple example was folks asked them to add a chicken sandwich to the menu and they did. The weekly menu specials are a nice way to change things up. My favorite burger is the Twisted Cactus burger and it has always been cooked properly. I'm a medium well guy and get sick and tired of other places bringing me out a rare burger. Thank you TC for getting it right. 

We look forward to more beers being produced by Twisted Cactus. In the meantime the alternative selections, especially from other AZ Brewers is great. 

Everyone should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Father takes care of the patrons, son is the chef. Thoughtfully prepared burgers- we had the Bacon Bleu and the Cowboy Burgers.  Their French Fries are the ultimate comfort food and dipped in their aioli or spicy ketchup (think curry spice with deeply sweet tomato) is heaven for the card lover in me. They've only developed one beer, their Twisted Cactus IPA, which is exactly what I want from an IPA- hoppy, but clean, refreshing. What a beautiful Sunday lunch spot! Additionally, as I type this Creedence Clearwater Revival is playing over their overhead system. Highly recommend, will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Criminally devoid of customers, which is perhaps due to a typical Monday evening, but your loss is my gain! Disco tunes, baseball on the screens. Very comfortable atmosphere.

Limited selection of beers, but what they have is top notch, and inexpensive pours to boot.

The Big Chandler burger was juicy, smoky, and very well balanced. Bun had just the right amount of chewiness, and the dressed arugula was a perfect accompaniment.

Beer Bites were good, if typical, but the presentation was wonderful and the beer cheese was on point.

After years of using Yelp to find good food and drink, this is my first review. Take that for what it's worth, but I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed after all the other reviews I had read. They now have barbecue and it is average. The burgers also were average. The fries are great. I wish that I found it equal to what others have said about the place."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and excellent service!!! We will definitely be back. The locally brewed beer is a bonus!!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with this little place in a shopping mall.  Varied local beer selection, and they offer wine and cocktails also.  Their burgers were outstanding.  Great flavor, I recommend the twisted cactus burger with the roasted poblanos.  Fries are very good also.  Service was outstanding, they took very good care of us from the beginning and made sure we had an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This place needs management help. Walked in and told to sit anywhere. Took a while for a server to even come over to take drink order and give us menus. Even though one \"server\" was chatting it up with another table. The menu looked decent but the long wait for a beer, the mild odor and poor atmosphere turned us off. The table next to us asked the server about the tuna sliders. His response? \"I don't know. No one ever buys them. I haven't even seen them.\"  After that, we bailed out. I hope the owners take control of this place in a hurry or they will go broke fast."}
{"text":"my new favorite  place  to go. great  beer!!!!   awesome  burgers.  the staff rocks. A gem in Chandler."}
{"text":"Great service, the pretzel bites were good and I enjoyed the IPA. The atmosphere was pleasant. We would definitely go back and try the other beers that were available."}
{"text":"Came across this gem with my husband. We were in the mood for bbq and some beer. This place did not disappoint. Alex was a AMAZING. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Was excited to check this place out. Hours posted stated open until 10pm. Showed up about 8.15pm and they had already closed.  Why even post hours if you don't adhere to them."}
{"text":"First time visit but we'll definitely be back. Hubby had brisket sandwich and I highly recommend the Twisted Cactus burger. Owner was there waiting tables and making a point to talk to everyone. Great local hangout."}
{"text":"This was a quick stop for us... I had the brisket salad since I was trying to eat healthy but the French fries is what I really wanted. Hubby had the pulled pork both our meals came out fast and fresh.  Belgium Tripel beer... the charm of this place is the service. Where some places service is good and sweet our server was authentically a nice guy.  It's a small place but if it was in our neighborhood we would be regulars."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in on a Friday afternoon.  It was empty, so we had a chance to talk to the bartender about the future plans for their beers.   They had a pretty standard selection of local/craft beers on tap.  We tried the salsa/guacamole appetizer, which left a lot to be desired.  In the description on the menu, the salsa was supposed to be \"roasted.\"  It was Pace, plain and simple.  The guacamole was freshly made, but it had virtually no flavor.  It needed some spice or pizazz of some sort.  I am willing to give them a second chance when they have their own beers on tap, but I'm hoping that their food quality improves before the next visit."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick business lunch. Casual place and small. Had a Twisted Cactus burger and it was very good, as were the fries. Decent sized burger for the price, and I'd say it was larger than average. Also had a Barrio Blonde beer, which was also good.

Overall, a decent place with good food and good prices. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and ambience!  Went in with grandparents, kids and grand kids.  Very enjoyable.  Would highly recommend, and we will be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for real barbeque, this is it.  We are from Texas, and are amazed we found REAL barbecue, not the bland or too sweet Arizona style. The moment we walked in, the wonderful smells from the kitchen caught our attention. Ice cold beer or cocktails, super friendly, down to earth employees, and locally owned which is a huge plus. One of us ordered ribs, one ordered a shredded pork sandwich with potato salad which gets five stars, and one a huge salad. Each of us ate every bite. It's a small cozy place in a strip center, but don't let the store front fool you. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place!  Service and even some of the other patrons were very friendly. Nice atmosphere, plenty of local brews and wines to choose from. Food was reasonably priced and delicious. Great burgers and tacos. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is the PEAK of customer service. We were looking for a new brewery to dive into and we found a hidden gem. Delicious food, amazing beer and fare prices. The chef though is something to rave about. I came here with my 78 year old grandfather. He's senile and we love him. We ordered the poutine so it would be soft for him too chew and he complained about the lack of pulled pork. This chef hand delivered us more pulled pork on him. I was so happy and papa was a little embarrassed but they also gave us 2 glasses to take home. 10/10 I would recommend again."}
{"text":"Came into town and wanted to check out this place due to the many positive reviews. We had a party of 12 and got seated in no time. Small place but we were in luck because it was fairly empty. The menu is simple and the descriptions help. We ordered our drinks and food and only waited 8-10 mins for the food to arrive. There is only one person in the kitchen making the orders so I was a little surprised at how quick our food arrived. Food is great! Everything was cooked fresh and the fries were delicious. My only complaint is when you order a soda, you get a can and no refills."}
{"text":"Amazing service. I don't think my glass of tea ever was empty. Had the pork sandwhich and side salad. The salad was big enough to be the entree. Terrific homemade dressing.
Husbands Cuban was tasty and filling as well. 
Will stop again when not planning on traveling just to sample all the beer."}
{"text":"Place had great burgers great beer great service fight was on football is on good time"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and a burger at lunchtime.  Good beer, good food and wonderful personnel.  Our go-to place in the future."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, and great service! I tried their pulled pork sandwich and house IPA which were both awesome! The server was super cool and very attentive, the rest of the staff was wonderful, too! I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The V Beauregard Blueberry Sour Ale from College Street Brewery is the BEST beer I have ever tasted. The truffle fries were amazing, and so was my pork sandwich. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Went in thinking this was a brewery, since they have brewing company in their name. They had nothing brewed by them. Very confusing. Even at that, they only have a couple of beers to choose from. Ordered poutine fries to eat. Not impressed. Fries had zero seasoning. Gravy tasted like it was a powdered mix. The only thing they have going for them was the pulled pork on the fries was good. Wilderness brewing company blows them out of the water. There are too many new breweries and places to eat for this place to last. Nothing about this place makes us want to return."}
{"text":"Good choices of beer particularly IPA's... rotating taps ...friendly... great smoked brisket sandwich"}
{"text":"We came here for a late dinner on a Wednesday. There weren't many people here but it wasn't empty. We were told to sit anywhere and we got our menus right away. 

Drinks- we don't drink beer, so maybe that was our mistake. They didn't have iced tea. The soda is in cans. I got Diet Coke. The ice that I poured my Diet Coke into tasted horrible. Made the whole drink taste bad. 

Food- we got the poutine as an appetizer and it was good. I'd recommend  it. It did take awhile to come to our table though. We also ordered burgers and fries. They were delicious- hence more stars. Cooked well and tasted great. One complaint- we wanted to try the trio of sauces but the server (who is also apparently the owner) said they were out of all of the sauces. Bummer. 

Service- ok. Not great. He was a little frazzled and seemed to not quite know what he was doing. It also took a very very long time for him to bring us our bill. In fact I wrote this review while we waited. We eventually had to get up and ask for it. 

Overall- I think there are a lot of areas for improvement and it could be a lot better."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick bite and all four of us gals were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the twisted cactus burger and it was delicious, cooked exactly the way we asked. The twisted blt was the best my friend said she's had, perfect bacon. And the homemade fries were homemade and delicious. Our waiter was excellent and polite (and cute!). Not much on atmosphere, but hey it's a bar!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! The staff was friendly and the service was wonderful! Not to mention food that good is hard to find in Arizona! It will be a weekly stop."}
{"text":"Just in town for the weekend. Stopped in for a quick one and a snack. Had two beers and the poutine. House IPA"}
{"text":"I was pretty unimpressed with this place and vowed to not go back, but after they switched ownership, I decided to give it a try and I am glad we did. The ambience is so much better. With the original owners, it almost felt a little awkward and the servers were totally untrained. Under the new ownership, we felt welcome and there was music and sports on. The servers were very friendly and took good care of us and the food was great. Overall, I am glad I went back and will definitely try a few more times since it is so close to my house."}
{"text":"Their burgers are excellent! Like one of the best burgers I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place. Their tacos weren't good but everything else was delicious."}
{"text":"Had 4 adults for lunch. Found on Yelp. BBQ w/sides, small but GREAT BBQ with excellent personal service W/beer & wine!!!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now at different times and days since they opened in November. The service is always fantastic, and the food is superb. Their current mussel special is DIVINE.  I will continue to frequent this place for the hospitality, service, and food. Once they start brewing their own, it will only give me a FOURTH reason to keep returning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend stumbled upon this brewery for some dinner and it was excellent! Service was great! Server was very attentive and kind. The food was really awesome. I got the Cuban sandwich (which I recommend with one of their specialty sauces, yummy) and he got the pulled pork sandwich also really tasty. May need some more local breweries on tap but their ice is the bee's knees. Def recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent place for pulled pork sandwiches, rack of ribs, or for just a drink. All vegetables for fries and side dishes were fresh. The rib meat fell off the bone and the barbecue sauce was perfectly balanced. This is an excellent place for couples to get a drink, appetizers or a meal. Well done!"}
{"text":"Drove an hour to meet a friend (Chandler is half-way between her house and mine) and was pleasantly surprised at how amazing all of the food was. Hands down one of the best lunches I have had in a long time and one of the few places that serves an ACTUAL Portobello sandwich that was cooked properly!  The Truffle Fries appetizer was also delicious. Absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Sign says under new management so didn't ask the history. I'm not a big BBQ guy but their food was amazing. Both the brisket and pork were delicious, they were out of potato salad so we went with Cole slaw which was just ok. Service was great, beers cold and good selection. They offered tastings before you ordered one."}
{"text":"I love to try new places - especially breweries. I was excited to try this place, as it was just down the road from my house. I went during lunch on a weekday, so not too much traffic. They have not yet started brewing their own beer, but that should be happening in the next couple of weeks. I will definitely return to sample those.

As it is now, they have six taps of regional beer. Mostly Arizona, but they did have 2 varieties of Scuplin on tap. Although just a few handles, all of the beers are good options. I had a coffee brown from the Shop (another one of my favorite places) and a Dragoon IPA. The food not only was good, but for a brewery the presentation was excellent. I ordered the Cuban sandwich, and the marinated pork was excellent. I paired it with a salad instead of fries. The portions were large and the presentation was impressive. I would go back just on the food alone.

The space has a nice feel as well. I love the exposed brick look. This will be a great spot to hang out and have a few new local beers and good food. Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Great little local bar!  We were visiting from NC and went here based upon other reviews on Yelp. Smoked BBQ very good and appetizer tacos tasty!  Small section of draft beers, but a good mix. If we lived here, it would certainly be a place we would frequent.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night and were fully expecting a wait and were surprised to find very few patrons here. The Yelp reviews were fantastic so we gave them a try. It didn't start off well when they were out of ribs. What??? Out??? The photos of the ribs are what solidified this as our choice for the evening. HoHum...okay...on to option B, which was the burger. It also looked fantastic in the yelp photos. Well it was less than spectacular when it arrived at our table. Didn't look anything like the gigantic burgers covered with bacon and cheese in the photos. The burger didn't even cover the bun. Disappointment #2. HoHum! Now there were some good things about the place. The seating is very comfortable! Love the table chairs! The service was very good! We were greeted nearly immediately upon entering and seated right then and there. The space is nicely laid out with plenty of elbow room and the burrito was fantastic as was the pulled pork. I'm torn between three stars and four."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this place and it fell short. The beer bites were good. The salad had a lot of soggy pieces of luttuce. The chicken sandwich has almost no chicken on it. The flavors were there, but I was eating mainly bread and arugula. The burger was a premade patty and that was disappointing. The bartender gave me a nasty look when all I ordered was water."}
{"text":"Thanks, to my fellow Yelpers; I was able to have one of the best Burger for my lunch. I mixed the Cow Boy and Big Chandler Burger together. Man, I almost ate my fingers and, I bit my tongue. I'm shocked this spot isn't crowded. My new go to for a real big juicy, flavorful, taste like, home cooked backyard grill'n Burger spot. Will I share like the Care Bear's? Absalutily ;)"}
{"text":"The guys here are very nice.  The environment is nice for a laid back date night. My husband and I try to visit new places and this one we will defintely be back to visit.  Burgers were fulfilling and beer waa awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow, my new favorite place   Wife and I had burgers that were great but we saw bbq come by us that looked Fantastic. Guy next us at the bar confirmed it. We will come back for  more. Loved it."}
{"text":"Not a brewery as of this writing as they are waiting to get approvals to start brewing.  The food is really pretty good but a small menu. Salads and Burgers essentially. Pretty tasty sauces that you can order extra give the food an extra lift.  Pretty fair prices.  Place is on the small side with maybe 30 seats so not really good for large groups."}
{"text":"First of all ..... this place is not a Brewery, they sell other Breweries products and there is not much of a selection.

Food is ok but they always seem to see how fast they can serve you like it's an accomplishment.

When you order food and they serve it 3-4 minutes later, it's like it was already made, all the did was take it out of a warmer and put it on a plate.

Also .......  I guarantee if the sold Coors Light and Jack Daniels more people would be there and stay longer.  Everyone knows BBQ and Whiskey go hand and hand."}
{"text":"Wow. Great beers on tap. Had the American burger and fries and wonderful char on the burger and very juicy. Fries fresh and homemade. Hubby had the 3 meat bbq platter. Could not decide what was best. Think we liked the ribs but pulled pork and brisket equally tasty. We'll def be back!    PS Tony was an awesome server and helped us with beer and food selections."}
{"text":"Tried this place after looking on Yelp!  Very nice Papago Orange Blossom Brew.  Loved it. The burgers we ordered were so delicious. Our boys loved their Cowboy Burgers. We are definitely gonna return!"}
{"text":"I think the primary photo of a burger served on a wooden plank is deceiving. That picture is what drew me in to try this place. I ordered that burger with potato salad. It was served in a green plastic basket, totally unlike the photo. The side of potato salad was a tiny scoop that you could eat in 2 bites. Which was sad to me because the potato salad tasted very good! it tasted far better than my burger.

Also, I'm confused by the name because I thought twisted cactus would have their own brews, which they did not. I enjoyed the beer I did have, which was an IPA. The TV picture quality is also kind of poor. 

The owner was pretty nice though. He was inviting, and recommended we try the BBQ next time."}
{"text":"I like places like this that are kind of out of the way and really unassuming. Just a small little bar but I had a great time. 

I got a burger and it was cooked perfectly, the fries were on point and the guy who served us was super cool and helpful. It was my first time in and I had some questions that he answered without hesitation. 

One of the nice things about this place as well is that it's menu is not massive which makes things easy in choosing. 

Go here, eat food, be happy."}
{"text":"Solid. The burger was masterfully prepared spot on medium rare. The fries were fresh cut and perfect. Beer selection was the local brewery standards with a good house IPA. We were very pleasantly surprised at how phenomenal the burgers and fries were.  Definitely found a great alternative to the quickly declining Four Peaks."}
{"text":"The intersection of Ray and McClintock lacks a good bar.  Bongos tried.  Nosh tried.  Zipps was at the the NE corner for years.  Now they have moved.

This leaves a void.  A  monopoly for a  neighborhood bar and grill is available.

Twisted Cactus Brewing Company might have landed the punch.  They have been opened for months.  Tonight the bartender said some kegs didn't come in.    They only have 7 drafts on the menu.  Their own brew is far off.  Just focus on what you can provide and customers will come.  No need to apologize before each beer order.

This location is hidden.  I am hoping for the best.  

My bartender was great.  Got me a beer and kept her attention on me.

No waiting, she knew I was reading the menu and got my pretzel order in.  Small size.  Fine for me, but not for more than 1.  Pic shown.  Good cheese sauce.

It was rather dead.  Sad for a Friday night.  I made my order and it was quick to arrive.  A,great presentation on the board.   This was the Cactus Brewery Burger with Swiss and green chillies.  

Too many fries for me"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is delicious and they are family owned and operated. We had the meatless burrito, veggie tacos, and burgers. All we perfectly cooked and the drinks were great too. The service is awesome as well, attentive, caring and just fun! Thanks for a great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Very comfortable/cool AZ setting. Their house IPA is very good, and the Stockyards hamburgers are great. We love the trio of dipping sauces and their homemade fries. Tasty, casual, cool with good music and nice neighborhood bar scene."}
{"text":"My Lovey and I went during our lunch break and we were pleasantly surprised.  The food was really good and the beer was quite tasty.  Tony was our server and I'm confident he was the owner. Very nice guy, pleasant and extremely patient.  We both had the Bomb Burrito.  I had the pork and Lovey had the brisket. We added a side of fries.  The burros were as good as any i've ever had. The fries are some of the best i've ever had.  We also enjoyed a nice cold glass of Kohi imperial coffee stout. Prices are very reasonable. We got out of there for $31 and I'm happy paying that to fill my belly and sample some great local beer.  Tony told us that he's preparing a happy hour menu and should have it all squared sometime next week.  We will def be back.   Prost!"}
{"text":"We had a taste for BBQ last Saturday and after seeing all the great reviews decided to try Twisted Cactus since it's so close to our house.  We were greeted quickly upon arrival and told we could sit anywhere we liked.  In just a few minutes the waiter brought menus and we ordered our drinks.  Food came up fairly quickly. My husband ordered the brisket, pork and potato salad with an extra side of Cole slaw.  I ordered brisket, ribs, fries and an extra side of Cole slaw.  The brisket was very tasty and served on Texas toast, but it was cold.  The pork was excellent and warm.  The ribs were outstanding and warm.  If the brisket would have been hot we would have given the meal five stars!  As for the sides, the fries were awesome, but the Cole slaw and potato salad weren't worth it - both were totally  tasteless.  Prices are reasonable.  Will we return?  Probably, when we want bbq and don't want to drive far."}
{"text":"Very chill place to eat for the younger crowd. The music was very chill and more of a hip hop vibe. The servers who were brothers were very friendly and always asked if we needed anything. The drinks were not too bad and everything was quick and fresh to order. Whenever we are on this side of town we will definitely be visiting this spot again for good laughs and good food."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Local beers and delicious bbq are excellent. Really enjoyed our lunch. I had chopped bbq pork sandwich while my wife had the bacon bleu burger. Fries are hand cut and delicious. 

Want processed food and a Bud, if so, don't go here."}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever! My husband and best friend and I were in town for a wedding. We stopped for lunch at Twisted Cactus. We all agreed - hands down the best BBQ any of us had aver had! Well done - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the pork quesadillas. Perfect size/portion. Lot of great flavor and fresh. Definitely recommend this dive   staff was genuinely friendly too."}
{"text":"Three of us ordered the brisket burrito. I was excited to try it. All three of us were disappointed. Wasn't bad, just plain. No flavor. It came with salsa that was just as plain as well. Could not spice it up at all."}
{"text":"We don't live near by (we live in central Phoenix), but were in this area and love to try out new breweries.They did not have their own beers yet, but had a good selection of guest beers. ( I am guessing they have their own beers by now). We chatted the whole time with the very friendly bartender and even the cook stuck his head out to see if we liked his Cubano (very good!). We thought this place was fun, friendly and had a really good vibe. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The food we have ordered was absolutely delicious. The portions were decent sized. We've ordered poutine fries, burger and a burrito. The food arrived in a timely manner. 

The service was outstanding. The gentleman (owner?) serving us was the only person on staff besides the cook and he handled all tables like a champ.
This is a nice local joint and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover. Looking at the store front you can't guess the delights that await you when you walk through the door. The food is very good, reasonably priced.  Especially the lunch menu. They have a decent selection of draft beer, although a lot of IPAs. More diversity would be appreciated but I have zero complaints. I had a wonderful lunch and the service was great. 
If you've been waiting to give this place a try, do yourself a favor and end the wait. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place on a date night out.  I was initially against going here due to the small amount of available seating, but was able to get a bar seat, which was excellent.  

The food here is actually really great, my burger was perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  The fresh cut fries were delicious and crispy.  The wife also ordered a burger, but without a bun as part of her diet, and they delivered a delicious patty on a bed of lettuce with all the toppings.

The service was very friendly and everyone was hustling and working very hard to make sure that everything was running smooth and quick.

I think they take reservations, so I would definitely call ahead before arriving if you are coming during peak dinner hours with a group.

Next time I go, I am absolutely going to try the BBQ, I wanted to try everything I saw going out of the kitchen.

They also have a pretty decent selection of micro brews that they seem to change weekly based on what the owner chooses, and the price for the beer was not bad at $5.50."}
{"text":"Awesome place - great food, great service, very cool vibe inside. It's kind of small but it's very cool. They have smoked meats and burgers and a good selection of local beers which is the perfect idea for a restaurant if you ask me. The portions are good size. The poutine fries for $6 was huge. Definitely will be back here when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in the experience. The beer was okay. The food was okay, but the portions leave something to be desired. Don't get the brisket tacos. They only give you two small tacos and they lack flavor. For the portion sizes and food quality, this place is overpriced. Plus, I had to ask each time I was ready for a new beer, and I was sitting at the bar. They were not that busy either."}
{"text":"I'm glad we found this place. They have excellent food and friendly service. If you want a delicious burger come to Twisted Cactus because their burgers are awesome! They also have a delicious brisket sandwich too. We'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu.  :)"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place. Good food and service, delish beers and super good vibe. Go check it out small local and fun."}
{"text":"We had a really great lunch! We had a burger and poutine and a salad. Everything was very tasty food wise. The bloody Mary needed some doctoring (hot sauce, pepper, salt did the trick)...but the staff was really lovely Abe the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"This restaurant/sports bar had no shortcomings. The service was above and beyond, the atmosphere was nice, music was good, and the food was absolutely delicious. I saw an old picture of a burger that they no longer had on the menu, and the cook shouted out \"I can make that!\" when I was asking the waiter about it. It was very tasty. It's tucked away in the corner so it's hard to spot, but definitely worth giving it a try! I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This review is based on two visits this past weekend during the daytime for lunch. They have one menu so no changes at night. I had read some prior reviews so I was wondering what I was walking in to but was pleasantly surprised.

Atmosphere - Good natural light during the day, the tables aren't crowded so it was comfortable. They had good music in the background but it was at the right level. They have a semi-open kitchen so you see the chef working hard to put out some really good food.

Service - It wasn't real busy and we had very attentive service. No issues.

Beer - They haven't started brewing there yet but have a good variety of 7 taps with some great local breweries like Huss Brewing.

Food - Everything, from both meals, was outstanding. Of the four dishes we had three different burgers and they were the best I've had in the area. The  1/2 lb patties have a good sear/char but cooked perfectly to my requested temperature (medium rare). All high quality ingredients from the meat, bun, bacon, etc. We had the Twisted Cactus burger with fresh poblanos roasted, the Cowboy Up which has a ton of flavor and the Bacon Blue which had awesome bacon. The French fries are handmade and awesome. I'll repeat, best burgers in the area, period.

I've read other reviews and heard the same things from friends so I hope management has worked out the service because the burgers are go to dishes."}
{"text":"Cenosillicaphobia is the fear of an empty glass. Make sure you keep a well-stocked fridge full of beer, y'all!

My real rating is closer to 3.5 stars. They recently got bought out like three weeks ago so they have to reapply for a new license in order to serve their own house brews so instead, they have other Arizona beers on tap. I feel like I can't rate them fairly yet since they don't have their house brews so let's just talk about everything else. 

The food is pretty decent. They smoke their meats in house so that beautiful smoke meat ring can be found in your meat. I usually like my ribs saucy but I can appreciate that they don't want to mask the smokey flavor. The brisket sandwich was a bit dry though. I offered my coleslaw up to add moisture into the brisket sandwich. The house salad was basic as heck though so I'd probably skip that. 

They have a small selection of Arizona beers on tap. All are served in a perfect cold mug. I can't wait to be able to try their own brews.

Service was a bit lacking since there were only like two people serving the whole restaurant but they're trying their best.  All in all, I would love to come back and try some Twisted Cactus beer but for now, I'm a bit sadden by the misleading business name."}
{"text":"Short and sweet review. Great service. Nice people. Great beer! Great food. We had the ribs (#OMGdelish) and the portobello burger.  Highly recommend it! We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite after reading some reviews. I was under the impression that this was its own building and a nice bar. Walking into a small storefront and the bar was pretty small, well lit, and no music.... I questioned even staying there, just for the fact that it seemed kinda boring. I ordered a beer from a local brewery (huss scottsdale blonde) and I ordered the a-1 burger. After having a couple beers I started to enjoy myself, the staff was very courteous and friendly. The burger was bomb, and the fries were just as good. I would have hung out for awhile longer if they had a jukebox or at least a radio going on. Good place for a quick bite, but after that onto the next place for drinks!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here today for a quick bite. We found out that they just changed ownership and were happy with the results. Sidebar - we had never visited the previous establishment! They had a small selection of local beer on tap - all good, all cold, all refreshing. The lunch menu was pretty standard and we decided on a Cuban sammy and fries. Delish! They split the plate for us at no charge (Thank you very much!) We watched a juicy 1/2 pound burger waltz by and a three-tier BLT get gobbled down nearby. Envy... next time a burger for sure. Friendly service, owner/manager all on site and a nice vibe. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a great presentation. If I were to nitpick I would like some bigger tvs and a drink list on the menu, but food and service are excellent and definitely exceeded expectations. Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"They don't brew their own beer quite yet as they just got new owners, but the food is phenomenal. I travel 4 days a week and this is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time (the bbq is no slouch, either). All beer on tap is local."}
