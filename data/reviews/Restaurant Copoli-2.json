{"text":"Small, corner greasy spoon that serves huge delicious burgers!  Really friendly owner that serves the food himself!  Not a place to bring a date but definitely great for a bite with the boys after the game."}
{"text":"Copoli's is a lovely little neighbourhood joint run by one of the nicest and friendliest owners I've ever seen in the resto business.  You can get breakfast in the mornings and later on Saturday, Sunday they are closed since that's when the owner gets to see his family, otherwise he is there open-close 6 days a week. They can do delivery, take out, eat in and it is done with a lot of care and love. They really enjoy the restaurant and food that they serve with one of the best thin crust pizzas (I love the Quebecoise and all of their pizzas have a sesame seed crust!)  Just overall a really nice place whether you want breakfast, lunch or dinner they are sure to serve you up something hearty with lots of love."}
{"text":"The service was nice. The diner ambiance was nice too. The food was remarkably bad.  1. The hamburger did not have the delicious fatty grilltop flavours you look for. Instead, it was very thin, dry and spiced in a way I did not like. 2. The sauce on the burger was too high in quantity and the flavour was off. 3. The BLT was perfectly fine once I removed the pickles. (It is not called a PBLT :) ). 4. The French fries are classic frozen, dry, mealy fair you get at the worst casse-croutes. Montreal is home to some of the greatest handcut dark tasty fries, so it is really disappointing when you get something like these. 5. The salad ingredients were fresh, but it's dressing was below average in quality.  6. The coffee is diner level, but worse than the dozens of diners I frequent. 7. The lemon square was reheated, but they left the middle cold."}
{"text":"D. The Mrs and I are in town for a visit.  We stopped in for breakfast and found ourselves a bit late.  The place had an old neighborhood atmosphere with aged wood, smell of grease, etc. Waitress was friendly and told us we could sit anywhere.  I ordered the chicken souvlaki w/rice. The chicken was tender and very flavorful, really good, on top of what appeared to be steamed jasmine rice, tatziki, and salad. If I lived in the area, it would be a place for me to go."}
