{"text":"I want to love this place based on location.  I have been to other Philly's in the valley and this is on par with those. Happy hour every day of the week is a plus. Service is good. Prices are typical. Great for sports with tvs everywhere and your own individual TV in your booth or most tables...I saw a dad here with his his kids who put on Disney channel at the booth for his kids while he watched sports on all the other Tvs around the bar...brilliant.   The only, but big, negative on this place is the smoke. The place always smells like smoke..they have a connected patio bar which is open to the main building and smoke from the patio. Constantly comes in. This place use to be The Garage and has these big garage doors that open to the patio...the LOVE having these open anytime the temperature drops below 105 and the smoke just flows in.   Service is good. Happy hour all week. Lots of Tvs. And a smoke factor.  That sums it up.   Also wings are mild and not saucy, so order one level higher than you normally would to get some flavor.  Update: the last 2 times I've been here the smoke has not been bad or even noticeable. I think they added, or turned on, a blower by the garage door that has made a huge difference. So they have gone up a star in my book!"}
{"text":"Philly's? More like Yankees!? You suck, real bad. Worse than than the phillies. Even one of the bartenders were routing for the douche bags. If you're a Philly fan go to upper deck and stay far away from this NY hang out! Boo to you sir and I only wish I could give you -100!!! Thank god I didn't eat a cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I had the philly cheese steak, my buddy had a burger and we split an order of mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were delicious and a good serving size; I think it was 8 pieces. My buddy said his burger was awesome.  My Philly cheese steak was pretty good too. It was a good size and definitely filled me up. The side of fries it came with was pretty small which was kind of disappointing but they were cooked well and seasoned well so that's good!  Our server was quick and professional. The only downside was that she was a little impersonal but she did her job well so can't really complain!"}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant after waiting over an hour and still hadn't received our food.   After we offered to pay for our two sodas and one salad,  the waitress said don't worry about it \"I got it.\"  The manager when I asked to speak to him looked like a deer in headlights,  when clearly they screwed up.   This after being at this restaurant a week or two ago and bragging to my son that we thought the restaurant had gotten better when it obviously did not get any better and said \"sure mom\",  I guess he was right.   Very disappointing experience,  we probably will not return.   :("}
{"text":"Grabbed some lunch here one day and thought it was awesome!  I'm not from Philly, so I'm not the expert in the area.  However for a good bite to eat on the cheap (and some fantastic curly fries), this is a great spot to hit up.  My gripe would be how long it took to get the food and then to get the bill.  If it's the lunch crowd, maybe some pep would be appreciated as I was late back to work."}
{"text":"This bar & grill was down the street from my hotel and I stopped in at a very slow time of day. I ordered a guacamole burger and it was AWESOME!! The guacamole was fresh & flavorful and a generous serving size. The burger was cooked perfectly, pepper jack cheese melted, pico de gallo was great and service was fast.   I stopped in the next day and ordered the Rueben. It was okay, but not as good as the guacamole burger! It was during happy hour, but my expectations were high, based on the prior day's experience.   On my next trip to Scottsdale, AZ, I'll stop back in and try a different burger!! One of the better burgers I've eaten in quite a while!"}
{"text":"Phillys is like an adult version of Friendlys with a bunch of TVs. Food was average, beer prices were average. Our waitress didn't have a clue about any kind of beer they had and also got our order wrong. But she was attentive and the place was low key and causal. Don't think we'll be coming back though."}
{"text":"Used to be a go to spot, now just a spot to pass up. The owners only want to get every dollar they can at the  cost of your experience. Been going here for three years, first time the management ever spoke to me was to move over a table. The management here is not friendly unless they know you. If not they don't care. They cater to their older kinda creepy crowd that they know. Which makes the younger people, sub 35, feel uncomfortable and not appreciated. Suggest to find a different spot to watch games. Cheap ownership, ie turning off the ac and opening doors when it's 85, wreck the experience. Unless your 45 or older you should avoid this place. Only went as long as I did because it was walking distance. However a $10 cab ride to tempe market place is a better option and money well spent."}
{"text":"Love it here!!!!!  Always great food!!!  Im trying to order something different every time i come here. So far, ice bern here 4 times. Fish tacos are not fishy but definitely filling, chefs enchilada soup was sooooo good, guacamole burger was very juicy n tasty and the cheese n carne asada dip is amazing!!!  Enough of what I've eaten. Come out n try it for yourself. Best bar food by far!!!!  Any football, baseball, hockey game, fight you want to see. Its here. Great for team get togethers. Most of all the atmosphere caters to all walks of life."}
{"text":"Servers were afraid to come to our table, Rian finally came to our table once I had to stock him down. My beers were empty for over 20 minutes, he walked around to everyone else to fill sodas, but my beer wasn't important. Other then  bad service food was also a disappointment, had their \"Carne quest dip\" was terrible, taste like something I would of had from Taco Bell... Meat taste like breakfast sausage. Once my beer was empty, for over 20 minutes, I had to stock down Rian again for our tab... Had money to spend, unfortunately, my whole experience was disappointment... I won't be back, and definitely won't recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Few sports bars can boast the best staff in town...Philly's on Warner can!! From the second I walked in to closing out there was always a friendly face greeting me. I had fast service & my drink was never empty. The chef accommodated my weird random requests and gave me EXACTLY what I wanted.  I'm a sports fan and I have found my new spot! You name the sport, Philly's on Warner has it! I watched Jason Day crush it from the tips, the Mayweather fight (I'm not a fan of his, just boxing), pro & college football all from my booth...simultaneously!!!  Tons of seating...get there early on game day, this place gets packed. It's the fans sports bar.  Dusty, Sue, Chip & Barry are ROCK STARS! Amazing management team off to a great start! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Took my oldest daughter there so we could end the debate.  Cheese wiz vs. white american.  Got one of each and split.  Much to her surprise she likes the cheese wiz!  Another \"Win for the Wiz\"!  Huge fan and in the wintertime the patio is perfect."}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor patio, even a peekaboo view of South Mountain.  But they need to banish cigar smokers from the patio. Meals are served out here. Ruins the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fucking awesome Sports Bar with amazing staff glasses are always cold for beer stop going to Zipps and get your ass across the street to Phillys..   Have to check out Macy and the rest of her badass staff"}
{"text":"Place sucks, we went there about 6 months ago and a male bartender started to ague with us about changing a channel on the TV. Then we order a salad and other food to take home, the salad was wet and it should have been thrown away, very Disgusting. Then last night on July the 11th a male bartender lied to us about seating at the bar, he said that there's plenty of seating but when we got there it was all filled up with Frat Boy. They were holding seats for their buddy's to come join them. Then on July 12th  I called to complain to the Manager John and he was very unprofessional!!!! He kept making excuses for all the poor Service and started to argue with Me. Place sucks and we'll be taking our business elsewhere, be smart go have fun where there's better customer service skills James"}
{"text":"Had a pick up dinner thru eat24 and pick it up within the approximate time. Ordered buffalo wings, garlic bread and lemonade . Quite satisfied and the portion was more than enough for one person. The place seemed nice from the inside , they got patio seating as well."}
{"text":"Went here last night about 6pm. Sat on the patio for 15 minutes finally the hostess came and asked if we wanted water while we waited for the server. Got the water waited 5 minutes more and got up and left. WTF it's not like it was busy. Went to a different patio bar and had a beer in hand and food offer placed with in 5 minutes"}
{"text":"Normally never have a problem here. Service is normally on point. This time the food was awful. We waited 45 minutes for an appetizer. The waitress blamed the cooks when she was clearly drunk while working and forgot to put our order in. When she finally came back and we ordered our entrees, my friend asked for a reccomendation and her response was it's f***ing Phillys. Get a f***ing Philly. Then recommended something not on the menu. She decided to spend most of her time at the table next to us filled with a bunch of guys. Needless to say she got no tip and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Happy hour till 7, plenty of TV's, good food, fights on the outdoor big screen and tasty Phillys! What else you need?? Good service, check! Chill patio, check! NHL Hockey, NFL, NASCAR, MLB, NBA! Good sports bar in south Scottsdale. Cold beer and drinks, check!"}
{"text":"Cool place for drinks but if your gonna order food, order it now while reading this review. Gonna wait a looooong time for your food to come out, I did on a slow Thursday night."}
{"text":"Used to love this location when it was The Garage Public House.  Didn't have food this time,  but it was clean, fast, the brew was solid & at a reasonable price with an excellent server/bartender! Probably still a great place to come for happy hours...next time!"}
{"text":"The restauraNt is awesome...except for the customer killer...K.D...bad rude manager...everybody else is awesome..avoid dreadlocked k.d....he is super unfriendly..and should have no customer contact...maybe washing dishes where he can be rude to himself.."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken salad & sea salted fries ... My first time coming to a Phillys and it was very satisfactory for my salad & fry craving ...lol yes I get fry & salad cravings I'd recommend this for ALL salad lovers they have a great variety of different delicious salads. Their fries where so AMAZING like OMG!!!Must stop to try there natural thick cut fries. So worth it!"}
{"text":"Love the TVs at every booth and the indoor outdoor atmosphere.  The food however has absolutely no flavor  I had the prime rib Philly and I kept adding salt and it still had no flavor.  My husband had the pastrami burger and in spite of it having  a burger, pastrami and sour krout (we were guessing) it also had absolutely no flavor either. He had to add ketchup in order to taste something.  The tater tots were delicious however."}
{"text":"We had our co-ed baby shower on a Saturday afternoon (2-5pm) at Philly's. We couldn't have been happier with the outcome and service. From start to finish everyone we worked with was amazing. Megan, one of the managers who deals with events, was so nice and super easy to work with throughout all our questions and requests. Everything was ready and set up when we got there- we were able to bring in balloons, decorations, a cake and games for our guests. Rian was our server and he was a rock star! We had a lot of people coming in and needing refills constantly and Rian took care of everyone quickly and with a great positive attitude! We were so impressed with how smoothly it all went and got so many compliments we got from our guests. We got the appetizer sampler off the catering menu that was a good variety of food and went a long way considering how many people visited the buffet over and over. We would highly recommend having an event at Philly's and you should definitely request to have Rian be your server!"}
{"text":"Decent brunch. Would be good place to watch football. Breakfast burrito was ok. Not great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food and perfect sports bar atmosphere! Our server provided us with A+ service. Beer is cold and food is hot. Amazing fish and chips, and of course the Philly is bomb. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Update: everything was corrected,  not only was approached and spoken with personally, but given a generous GC. The service, whether ots carry out or dine-in, has been nothing but awesome and spot on. Keep up the good work, and thanks for taking the time.to follow up!"}
{"text":"The philly cheesesteak wasn't the best....rather plain, the bread is good but the meat has zero seasoning. I am an east coast girl (Virginia) and in comparison it's a C-."}
{"text":"We have been customers of Philly's since the beginning, for years and years now. We go mostly for the friendly atmoshere, and of course the food too is excellent! The owners, I have come to know as friends and as local small business people. As a business owner myself, I have to say Philly's is ran top-notch. The owners really care about their employees and their customers!  BTW, we especially love the outdoor dog friendly dining."}
{"text":"Don't sit at the bar to watch a game. At half time they'll come over and change it on you. Not say a word, and your game disappears. So much for being there 3 hours early. Thanks guys.  Food is okay. Drinks aren't that strong. Thank god for the local beer reps handing out free beer. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"First time at Philly's last night.  People are raving, but I come from a real foodie city. I had the guacamole burger. Beef had little seasoning and guacamole fairly flat. The best advice I could give to the kitchen, try your own food. Atmosphere is fine. Lots of media available (TV) on walls. Nice touch with table side option. A great place to watch \"the game\". Beer was nice and cold. The bar, which is the centerpoint of the restaurant,  is the same as the old Garage. Needs something to define it as a different bar. I would change the greeting system. The elevated platform feels \"club\" like. Strange for a sports bar and doesn't match the feel. Servers were very attentive and friendly. All in all, neither great nor terrible...just meh"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a bar where you're forced to pour your own drinks along with your dignity? Well you're about to be as surprised as I was. The waitress threw numerous amounts of napkins and utensils at me....  I picked up my lady friend having worked a dreadful but pleasant 12 hour shift. We tried out Phillys for the first time and let us say, \"It's NOT always sunny in Philly's\" the waitress brought us our cold wings after waiting a long 45mins. We had to wait another 15mins without utensils. Upon her arrival she tosses the utensils at us like we were slices of meat."}
{"text":"I just moved to Arizona and am right across the street from this bar.  The bartenders and patron have all been super nice the couple times I've been there.  The food is great and the Bloody Mary bar on Saturday morning was the perfect fix for my hangover!  I'm glad this place is a block away as I'll be frequenting here often after my first couple experiences dining and partying here!"}
{"text":"Charging a cover on a random Saturday night. So, not worth anyone's time for five dollar beers. This is the kind of bar that is dissipating quickly in phx, which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time for happy hour.  Very big and clean place lots of tvs for sports.  Had some drinks wings and tried the Philly cheesesteak pretty good. Good service and food."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend to check this place out.   I went on a Monday night, and since no football or any major sporting events were on, place was pretty empty (may be about 6 customers)    The place was pretty clean and maintained.  I could picture this spot with plenty of people when the college games are on over the weekend.  Music volume was decent, I didn't have to shout to place my order and I can hear the bartenders every word that she told me.  Phillys has a good amount of food to pick from.  I can imagine Phillys is a place to go get cheesesteaks but I wasn't in the mood for it, so I played it safe and ended up getting a Cheeseburger with fries.  I didn't wait long for the food and to my amazement , it was delicious.  I ended up paying $12 for my food.  The burger was pretty huge to begin with.  I was completely satisfied with my meal from the first bite down to the last.  The burger tasted as if it was made out of fresh beef, fries were crisp just right, and the amount of condiments (lettuce, tomatos, pickles) were not over filling.  Definitely a step up above Dennys with better taste as well.  Overall the experience is good.  I'll definitely come back again to try the other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I really want to give this a 5 star , okay actually I will ... They can't help it that it's a Philly Sports bar :(  The food is amazing , fast and the bartender is very fast !! I shall come again , maybe when the cowboys play them ...!  Woot woot"}
{"text":"Ok for starters I live very close and have been here probably 10 times. The food is really not very good and typically the service is a little slow.   I'm writing this review while drinking a bee and watching UFC  and for UFC this place is great. This review is specifically about the manager Jay.   I picked up my buddy from the airport and he was already a little tipsy. Made it through the door guy at Phillys and paid our cover with no trouble and went inside to meet some friends. My buddy began ordering doubles and was \"beyond repair\" before the main event started. Jay the manager realized this quickly and came up to him very politely and explained that he was too drunk. Did NOT kick him out. Just slowed his drinking way down.   Both parties were extremely polite and no testosterone issues at all. Jay...you are an all star manager that shows and commands equal respect. As the sober observer watching how you handled the situation with amazing skill. As much as I hate the food here, because of you i will be a regular.   If you come here while Jay is working, say hi and tell him you read this. Dude is a rockstar bar manager and others can learn a ton from this dude."}
{"text":"We love this bar! Cool people, cool staff and great food! Service is quick and friendly. We have had their Philly cheesesteak sandwich many times and it never fails here. Their happy hour drink and food specials are amazing. Great open environment with lots of TV's for watching sports. There are even small TV's on each table to watch whatever you want. The outside patio and bar is very large with misters to keep it cooler. You wont find anything dark or creepy here like some of the dive bars in the area. Thanks Philly's!"}
{"text":"When a place is called Philly's and on the menu is has \"The Original Philly\" I assumed they would know how to make a good Philly Cheesesteak... boy was I wrong...I've never had a cheesesteak were the meat was pretty much ground meat... was not very good at all... they do get points for using CheezWiz..  Maybe next time I'll just stick with wings... cause I'll definitely go back for the outside seating and good drink prices.."}
{"text":"Lots of TVs, excellent coverage each with a different game, sport and one at each high top table in the bar area including the news. Visited for the first time at 6:00pm Thursday during happy hour figuring the house wine at 4 bucks couldn't result in a totally bad experience.  If the wine didn't seem like it was so skimpy then I never would have written this review - but it seemed like a very small pour and I have never felt so strongly about a glass.  I don't often write reviews and I don't want to write reviews.   Each glass of wine was one half inch below the philly's emblem on the stemless glass.  We immediately rejected my wife's second drink, (Happy Hour $5.50 glass pinot Grigio.) This was first time in my life I have ever observed, much less participated in the rejection of any drink... never a glass of wine so low, half way below the Philly's emblem.  The bartender heard us telling the waitress that the amount of wine was inadequate and unacceptable and to take it back, she walked out to our high top table, took the glass and told the waitress she was not done pouring (I believe her actually, possibly in the middle of opening another bottle).   This was not the best bar food, or at least the entrees we ordered were not recommendable.  Skimpy, I had two small buffalo chicken sliders on small stale slider buns for $10 with cole slaw (though I ate everything).  My wife had a quesadilla which she made the mistake of ordering \"steak\" on it.  She liked the side salad on the plate and did not like the funky quesadilla.  Two stars because our waitress was good and all the other ones seemed like they were nice, attentive, on their game; there were a lot of waitresses around because not too many dinners.  The bar was full of patrons (none eating food), there were a lot of  open tables the ones that were occupied less ,than half had food on them."}
{"text":"Been to this sports bar several times since it changed from Public House Garage and the results were good. Food is good, except during football season. Football starts at 10 am, and they serve only breakfast till 11:30. Show up at 11 and want a hamburger?  Nope!  Have to wait another 30 minutes.   They do not even offer appetizers before 11:30; which is what the do best. Their queso dip is awesome, wings large and tasty. Too bad u can get them with your beer before 11:30.  Great place to watch the afternoon games since they have lots of televisions. But I walked out and took my party to Tilted Kilt after learning I could not get lunch food before 11:30."}
{"text":"Beer-battered mozzarella sticks (light crispy batter/AMAZING) and Pizza cheese steak (with stacks of pepperoni/AWESOME) and Kronenbourg on tap with a great juke box, a fun relaxing atmosphere, and outdoor seating if you need to smoke.  I love this place for a date, for a group of friends or to watch the game."}
{"text":"HE HAS CRAZY EYES WRITTEN ALL OVER HIM!!! WHERE ARE THE OWNERS?  What a piece of garbage of a manager they have!!!+ This guy talks down to his employees as if an authority figure, AND he talks down to his customers while playing rap music at night and acting like he's smoking a marijuana joint smoking a cigarette. This guy thinks he owns the place and anyone that goes there is contributing to his narcissist mind frame.   He has no business in the industry ruling as a dictator to his employees and talking as an authoritive figure to his customers."}
{"text":"This place has rapidly degraded over the years! It use to be way better, now it's filled with servers that give responses like \"oh I don't drink beer\" when you ask what's good on tap, it stead of maybe white-lie and just pick a random beer, tell the customer what's most popular, or give me something better than that response. Also on their menu at the bottom of the appetizer page it states \"appetizers Half off during happy hour\" which lead me to believe that was all the appetizers since there wasn't a separate happy hour menu on my table, after receiving my bill with a full charge I ask the server about it and she said, \"no it's only off the happy hour menu\" and pulled the menu off another table to show me. How often do you go to a restaurant during happy hour and the server doesn't mention it is happy hour and provide you with a menu before hand!? It's just terrible service"}
{"text":"Stayed at a hotel across the street. This was the first place I went to to go eat, around 7pm. It was great. Went the next day to start off the day; Chris and Alysia were awesome!! Great place!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick lunch on a Sunday, figured to grab a bite and watch a few mins of the NBA playoffs.   And would totally go back again anytime I'm in the area. Had the french dip and fries, really really good and the horseradish sauce they serve with it is off the charts. The fries were excellent, fresh and crispy but not overdone.   Service was super fast and friendly.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the standard bearer for a great place to watch UFC or boxing. They DO charge a small cover, but it's well worth it as the food is more than passable and in many cases it's quite good. Quality flat panels all around the place, so the details of the fights are always highly viewable.  Best of all: In the fall and wintertime, the patio is the perfect place to kick back and fire up a couple of good cigars. They have a pair of firepits that will keep you warm and you still have a great view of the action. Mmmm: UFC devastation, Philly cheese steaks, good wings, a great Arturo Fuente (King B or an Anejo) followed by a cup of coffee... It's as good as Scottsdale gets."}
{"text":"Service is great! Prices are great! Best place to watch a game!"}
{"text":"We ended up in Philly's to watch a UFC fight.  Not wanting to deal with the Scottsdale venues full of crowds and high-prices, a nice neighborhood sports bar sounded perfect.  There was a small cover at the door due to the fight, but we got a table near a TV with no problem.  We only had appetizers, but there were some other things on the menu I can't wait to return to sample.  Southwest cheesesteak with salsa and guacamole?  Yes please.  The chicken wings we did try were a solid B+.  The honey flavor was actual honey, and the wings were very crispy.  I also appreciated the quantity of carrots/celery.  Although we weren't drinking and were seated away from the crowds, our server was still attentive, sticking her head out every so often to make sure we were still ok.  At any other bar, the lack of alcohol would have depleted the level of service pretty quickly.    UFC isn't exactly my thing, so if I'm going to get dragged to see it, I prefer a comfortable place with good food and Philly's fit the bill.  But I think I will enjoy coming back without the MMA...actually, I'll likely prefer it."}
{"text":"I love the idea in a very much needed location. .Get a better menu the food is not even good or ok...shocked that the food is so bad..OWNERS pay attention to details taste the food get feedback..."}
{"text":"After like 2 hours debating where to go, my buddy decided to go here.  I had a beer, a cup of chilli, and Arnold Palmer and a BLDA.  One of my friends had a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and curly fries (which I tried as well).  The verdict:   The place is a neighborhood dive (at least the patio, since we didn't go inside), nothing impressive but comfortable.    The chilli was just an OK. My friend's sandwich was OK minus. So why four stars?  The BLDA (A stands for avocado) was delicious. Super crispy bacon, full avocado flavor, I mean, everything was good about this sandwich. The curly fries were also pretty decent.  The service and pricing just OK.  The Arnold Palmer wasn't good at all plus the straw was TOO short for the glass, that's pretty annoying.   *Note. I asked them not to put butter in my bread, idk if they do that, but my experience was without butter in the bread."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere. So, it's a sports bar. Probably not the first (or last) you'll go to. The service was fine, not overly attentive, but that's ok. I don't like it when the servers keep stopping by every 2 minutes. Logan checked on us and made us feel welcome. That's perfect for me.   My husband had the Ahi Tuna Salad. The fish was seared perfectly--cold center. It had a good texture and taste. The salad was fresh and the dressing tasty. I had the Chicken Parm Italian Philly--protein style (lettuce wrapped--no bun.) It wasn't actually wrapped, you couldn't pick it up and eat it. But hey, if it had arrived on a bud, I would have had to use a fork and knife on it anyway. Since I went \"sans bun\" I decided to get the fries (carb budget, you know). They were delicious. They looked and tasted fresh, like someone in the back had just cut up a potato, seasoned it and fried it. So good.   Nice beer/drink selection. Our drinks were frosty cold, and delivered promptly. We sat outside and enjoyed the fresh air and multiple screens. All in all it was a lovely evening.  The manager Serena, stopped by our table and chatted with us for a while before we left. That was a lot of fun. We will definitely be back. If not this trip, then the next!"}
{"text":"Long time Ahwatukee local. Just started coming to Philly's. IMPRESSIVE. The BLT with avocado is amazing.. Massive serving of crispy bacon, with tomato, lettuce, avacado on sour dough tells the story. (See Photo) with rings. $9.25!!  Super friendly staff and appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Just moved near this Sports bar.  Walked in on a Sat night for a beer n bite.  Sat at the bar.  The bartender wouldn't acknowledge n I thought it was strange.  Couldn't get her attention n she wasn't busy.  She had such a shitty additude it was almost funny.  I got up n went down the street.  First impression was not good."}
{"text":"If Alley and JT are here it amazing. Best service in the area. They make you feel welcome and have a have a great time. They are the reason I come here!"}
{"text":"Always a great time. Excellent service. Excellent food. And of course great cocktails. Jojo, JT, Dusty, and rest of staff are awesome. Stop by, you will be impressed."}
{"text":"I have never experienced such horrible customer service in my life. My first and last time visiting a philly establishment.   My friend and I were being simple paying customers. We purchased about 2-3 drinks each. After 2-3 hours, we decided to smoke a cigarette. As we were outside we sat on tables, as soon as we sat down the manager (African American with a beard and glasses...I think his name is KP )  came out and said \"what the f*** are you doing? Then screamed at us to get off the table. And I mean screamed at us! I thought he was a random drunk guy trying to fight us at first. He came off very aggressive! Under no surcumstance should you make your customers worry about their safety from the co workers. In conclusion I will never return but if the company had better customer service, then I might."}
{"text":"Great service - very attentive and friendly.  Good food - typical bar menu but very tasty and pretty large portions."}
{"text":"Went to Philly's for the first time and all I can say is wow! The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was fun.  I will be back soon and will recommend Philly's to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Brittany is  a great bartender.  She recognized me entering the restaurant right awhile and made me feel welcome with big smile.  Made a great impression of customer service. Thanks Brittany and Philly for a great bar experience!  Good food and drinks!  Coming back!"}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood bar. Bartenders can make a drink and are nice. I really enjoyed it and hope it lasts. The tv at the tables, bonus! Keep it up."}
{"text":"Good little neighborhood spot. Friendly faces and average food. Nice happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Nice place. One of my goto spots to meet friends after work etc. Very clean. Beers always cold and the have a really outdoor patio area with lots of shade and misters. Also heaters for the cool nights. Servers are cute and friendly. Lots of tvs."}
{"text":"I'm a little bit shocked. Given the place is called Phillys, you would think they knew how to make a Philly cheese steak sandwich.  Unfortunately, ... they don't.  Service was ok, I've had better. Burgers are awesome and always can find something to watch. Game, movie, shows.. etc.. You have your own TV at your table, that's cool. I'm just not sure about making it a \" regular \" spot. Maybe you'll have better luck...."}
{"text":"Phillys has the best servers in town. And the mimosas at Sunday brunch are fantastic."}
{"text":"I was super excited when this place opened and it has been a favorite of mine, seemed it was doing well.  Not sure what has happened - new cook? Less experienced staff?  But .... there were four of us dining on Monday night, service was slow and disorganized (meaning three different wait staff tried taking our order).  Ordered adult beverage including Dirty Martini with two olives.  When drinks delivered, was told they had no olives (hmmm) maybe say that when I order top shelf and give me another option?  Good thing no one wanted a Bloody Mary!  Our waitress did not write anything down for our food order, which I can respect if you can remember the order....My dinner partners had their order corrected, I just ate what I was served because I did not realize it was wrong until I started eating...but was disappointed since it wasn't what I was truly in the mood for.. Point being it has always been popular and a good place to eat and watch sports...I really hope they don't start cutting too many corners.  One of my dinner partners wanted to tell them to go to Basha's and get some olives LOL"}
{"text":"It's not a family place. Inhaled quite a bit of second hand smoke from inside the restaurant due to the bar being just on the other side of the open bay door. Smelled like a casino in there. Or like a mobile home that's been smoked in for years so the tobacco is just caked on the walls. Caught our waitress rolling her eyes a couple times, funny how they're always the nicest when they drop the check off, coincidence? Anywho, food was decent. Ordered the baby a side of Strawberries which maybe equaled 3 strawberries and was charged $2.50. Yikes! I ordered the garlic buffalo wings and enjoyed them. Cost was quite expensive. For queso dip, wings, cheese fries, 2 soft drinks and a SIDE of strawberries it totaled out to $40. Kind of want my money back due to the asthma attack I endured from inhaling the cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Birthdays are always a great occasion to celebrate, and Philly's is a great place to do it! (haha, I said do it)  Last night, was a friend's birthday, so we came down to Philly's (which I am pretty sure is one of her favorite bar's, and I can see why). This place is pretty cool! It's your typical, local sports bar.  Drinks are cheap, strong, and the vibe is very fun. Long Islands are $4 all day every day. Can't beat that. I smell $20 blackouts on the weekends. Or $20 bad decisions. Whatever you want to call it, I call it one hell of a good time....just be responsible.  The beer selection is decent. About 20 taps, with some craft beers. Fat Tire, Blue Moon, and a couple of selections from Four Peaks. Solid.  The food is your typical bar fare, with a Philly twist of course. Lots of Philly-type sandwiches, with lots of fries. Very tasty. I had the manager's special sandwich, which was topped with jalapenos. Had a nice little kick.  The outside patio is pretty fun, as long as it's not too hot. Luckily there are misters. Score.  I'd definitely come back. This is the place where you can just chill with your friends. No need to dress up. Wear shorts, flip flops.   Guys, leave your douchy jeans in Scottsdale. Girls, leave your slutty dresses and high wedges at your house. Everyone, leave your attitudes elsewhere. This place is for normal people."}
{"text":"Great food and location, loving hanging here ! They have taco tuesday nights and trivia which is fun. I really like their happy hour and patio area :)"}
{"text":"Different kind of spot. This isn't a Phoenix hipster spot. It has sort of a trashy feel. But, they show MMA which is why I was there, the food is good and the beer selection is good. Wouldn't just hang there but for an occasional event, it's ok"}
{"text":"I met a friend here by their choice to get some grub and to watch some games. In short - I was neither impressed or disappointed. The food was good and the prices were fair. If I had to complain about anything it was that the TVs were too high/too far away/too small. I guess I'm used to some of the monster screens that are at other sports bars.  I didn't get into the bar area so I can't comment on that - or on their drink specials. I did get the vibe that this could be a pretty cool local/neighborhood bar if you happened to live close by (I live 30 min away)."}
{"text":"The food was better than I had expected for a quick lunch. Our server was friendly and fast, and made helpful suggestions.   They are under construction so it's a little rough at the moment,  but lots of large TVs to watch."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but back tonight. I use to live in the neighborhood and came often. It's a fun atmosphere, good food and great outside bar area too."}
{"text":"After going there several times to see if this place has gotten any better since they first opened, I have eaten there several times and the food is really  good. Customer service has improved and the place seems very busy. The new opening week we really a bad experience but now I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was slow but the food was awesome! Fun atmosphere! Pool table, lots of tvs, games... Great time! And a bar!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great Service! Fun times for all.  I was there last on Wednesday 9/14. Beers are priced just right. I think I'll go again for Thursday night football. The people are so friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back. You could be at a quite table or with a loud party and still have you own unique experience."}
{"text":"After 10pm, there's not a lot of places to sit and have a drink in this area.  We found this place on Yelp and decided to grab a drink  They also had a pretty good selection of beers.  Looking at the menu, we also decided to order the Deluxe Philly.  Loaded with mushrooms, peppers, onions, and jalepenos - it was really good!   We'll definitely be stopping here again!"}
{"text":"Hmmm for a place that should be known for the cheesesteaks, something has gone very wrong in that category. The meat had no fat which was good, but did not resemble rib eye ( says on the menu) or top sirloin. It was more chewy than chopped and then the assembly was horrendous. A lone piece of white American was plastered on one side of the bun and obviously the cheese should be folded into the meat, so this was incorrect if you are being technical. Will not order the signature dish again as it was a very unsatisfying $11 spent. Bartender Mia though was very nice."}
{"text":"The was the first night the place was open and WOW! Our food came out quick, server Ayesha was very friendly and gave great recommendations! All of us were very impressed with our experience! The ranch dressing is house made not your typical ranch very very good! We are so excited to have new bar and grill inTukee and even more excited that they serve great food! We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Super friendly staff. Really good food. Everything but the Nachos. Don't get them. Nowhere near enough cheese."}
{"text":"Great place to watch your favorite sports team of just hang out. The booths have individual tv's so you can put it on whatever channel you want. There are plenty of big tv's throughout the restaurant as well. They are known for their Philly cheesesteaks and offer quite a few selections on those. I had the deluxe and it was really good. Sweet potato tots are awesome too. I was grabbing lunch for myself and watching part of a college football game so I sat at the bar area. My bartender was JoJo and she was awesome and very friendly. All of the staff were very nice. I will definitely be back. Thanks Philly's!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places in all of Arizona. Good deals, tasty drinks, good food, great atmosphere, interesting patronage.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Horrible place for cocktails. The food is what you'd expect. It's decent bar food. The wings (which are 6$ during happy hour were meaty and a good deal). But my real problem was with the bartenders. Now, i got served by two different bartenders. The guy served a decent drink. Nothing you could complain about. Unfortunately, he was only able to serve the first one. Then the female bartender started to work. Those drinks were completely different. I'm sure they were proper drinks at Disneyland or some other super corporate location. But it's the last thing you want from the local neighborhood hangout. Also neither bartender used a jigger (bartender measuring tool) and ended up serving two completely different drinks. I wouldn't be as upset if I got the same cocktail from the beginning. I would've just known that's how you train your bartenders. Now I'm left wondering, was I unfortunate to have her as a bartender or is this what I should expect? Well, after spending $70 for one person I'm left with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth. Definitely not in Tempe, AZ in August. I won't ever be going back. It would be a better deal to pay for an Uber and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We recently visited Tempe for a music festival. The hotel we were staying at is right across the street from Philly's, so we thought we would give it a try.  Out first night in town we came for happy hour drinks and a bite to eat after our long drive from San Diego. We ordered a Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza, and it was delicious!!! Their patio was large and it was a nice warm night; so we played some Corn Hole and Ping pong afterwards.  We came again on Sunday for lunch. Same great service. Got the Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza again, side salad, and a side of garlic fries. Once again everything tasted great.  Chill spot, we left pleased both times. Easy 5."}
{"text":"Wooohooo!! Love this place. Great place for just about anyone whether you're going for food, drinks or watching any type of sporting event (check out the 5' screen on the porch), but they do charge a cover for live UFC and Boxing events. They actually make \"real Phillys\" and have quite the selection. Real laid back, comfortable atmosphere and you see all walks of life when you're chillin out here. Bartenders are cool and you will get what you pay for, but you better like stiff drinks! This would be on the top of my list for just getting tossed and having a great time!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The food was usually great (except the burgers) and the service used to be at least average-to-good. The last several times I have been here there have been surly and unpleasant waitresses; that's when they actually acknowledged when you were actually here. Today, I was sitting in the Golden Tee area where they don't usually provide service, so even though the entire staff knew we were there since there were less than 13 customers in the entire restaurant- I went up to the bar to order. The bartender was too busy talking to the other waitresses to come ask what I would like- which was beer and food. The other waitresses saw me, ignored me, and didn't bother to see why I had been sitting there for 5+ minutes with nothing in front of me because they too were too interested in what each other had to say. Unimpressive and too pricey for providing terrible customer service. I was a waitress for many years; these people have no room to complain about not making $$$ with tips when they provide terrible customer service. Don't come here. Go to Zipps instead- amazing burgers & cheap pitchers of beer!"}
{"text":"I usually go on my lunch break but today I decided it was the last time. The staff is to slow. I had to walk out because I wanted to order to go but the host took all day coming back to see what I wanted that I used half of my time. Last time I went I found a clear rod in my fries. I got a cheese steak next door at the Nosh. It did the job. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.   We stayed across the street and they have a great beer selection and the food was really good.  We came down for bike week 2016 and found ourself here every night. The service was always amazing and the food was always good they even had beer from our state (WA).  The hot wings are great.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Well this is not a place to order a cheesesteak. I have been to Phillies numerous times over the years for  drinks and found the staff and atmosphere very nice but never ordered cheesesteak. First time i tried the cheesesteak it was garbage. Where's the cheese? So after a few months i decided to try it again thinking the cook had a bad day. I kept it simple an original philly cheesesteak. Stale bread with just a smear of cheese wiz. Even worse was the warm beer and the waitress ignoring me when i needed another beer to wash down the stale bread. It just amazes me that on some of my other visits the service was great and the rest of the bar grub was ok. I cannot go back to place that served such garbage cheesesteaks that is suppose.to be the highlight of the menu."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Phillys for years!   The best Cheers bar around.  Great place to hang out with friends and the staff is friendly and fun.  Great drinks, appetizers and food.  Love Taco Tuesday!!   Happy hour is 3-7.  Whether it is UFC, Football or any other sport, they have it all......Breakfast starting up with football!!  Can't wait."}
{"text":"This sports bar is absolutely awesome. The chicken wings and Philly Cheese steak were very good. The service is second to none. There were TV's everywhere and the place was packed. We sat on the patio and still had a great view of the games on TV. I already mentioned the service, but need to mention it again. They were prompt with getting us our order and always check on us with a smile. I will go back whenever I'm in Phoenix which is about a dozen times a year."}
{"text":"Reluctantly backing down two stars, have been here a few times recently and the food as been ok at best, however, the service level continues to be good so I'll give two stars.  Based on a few recent visits the wings have been overcooked as was the prime rib sandwich which was also overly seasoned, good prime rib doesn't need the seasoning but this wasn't good prime rib, friends steak had an odd texture, the drink special tonight which was the long island was way too sweet."}
{"text":"We've been here many times and like the neighborhood bar atmosphere.  The TVs are great and it's the perfect place to watch a game. We always get the Philly cheesesteaks and crab fries, so I can't speak to the other menu items. The first few times the food was amazing. As a Philly transplant in AZ, I know my cheesesteaks and always order it hoagie style- with lettuce, tomato and mayo.  The last few times we ordered the steak sandwiches the food was awful.  The rolls were cut in a way that the whole sandwich fell apart and the amount of meat in the sandwich is hit or miss. This last experience was the final straw though. Even though the order was taken for lettuce and tomato ON THE SIDE,  the cook cooked the lettuce in with the meat! Who does that?!?  So, if I order a burger with lettuce and tomato, should I expect the lettuce to be a hot cooked slimy mess on the meat?  We were told by a previous server to make sure Carl is working,  because he's the head chef and is great.  These last couple times we were told that a chef named Renee and a new cook were on.  It seems that Carl needs to make sure his other cooks get the proper training so the food stays consistently good.  We do love this place and it's a shame the quality of the food is going downhill."}
{"text":"So I ordered the chips and salsa. They were good. Except I had to order not one but two additional sided of salsa to finish the chips. They charge me extra. In addition the bartender was less than friendly and borderline rude. This place is a joke. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place! Great atmosphere and great food! Our server was very friendly and the host was extremely helpful with finding us a seat. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Once agan, I wish you could give half stars.  This is a nice little dive-y sports bar around my neck woods.  The food ranges from okay (e.g. the spinach and artichoke dip, fried zucchini, etc.) to good (e.g. the burgers, sandwiches, etc.).  The prices are reasonable around $8 for a cheeseburger (Angus beef) with one side (a variety to choose from including french fries, onion rings, and cole slaw), and the servie is very friendly.  I think it is worthy of a solid and respectable 3.5 stars.  It's good, just not very remarkable."}
{"text":"Had a few bar staff friends start work at this new bar and wanted to check it out. Nice clean place with large 60 inch LCD TV's. Some of the tables have their own tv at the table. Something different. This is a sports bar. The seating is varied with lounge type seats, booths and table seating. The owners have 2 other places in the East Valley area.  I ordered the \"original\" Philly cheese.  This came with a salad.  It was good and bliss to what I buy in Philadelphia.   Price was good at $ 7.95. Wife had BLT and she said it was good. Another fried had the soft tacos and he was pleased with his selection.   All in all. This was an enjoyable meal. Will be coming back to try some Of the other menu items. They also have some very good all day pricing for drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing food and bar service. Lindsey was fabulous. Highly recommend.  Best cheesesteak sandwich"}
{"text":"I go here sometimes with my boy because it's close to his house.There is this Jack Ass bartender that works here and he complains when you go from the outside bar to the game area and leave you glass or dishes. WTF? What type of employee would mention such a thing to a customer, that's a staff issue dude. Sorry Philly's but this rude roid monkey bartender is bringing down your establishment."}
{"text":"This bar is definitely not for trendy folks or people looking to 'be seen'.  It is a nice neighborhood sports bar with good bar food at a great price.  1/29/07 Philly's recently got a facelift and has new tables and they even have booths now.  They have also expanded their menu to include more dinner type meals, instead of just bar favorites.  Wednesday night they have a steak night with drink specials and a reduced price steak dinner.  Of course you can always order one of the many varieties of cheese steak sandwiches, because they are delicious.  This is just a relaxing bar with good food and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great spot! Philly's is right next door to my house, the first time I walked in the bartender introduced them self.  I have always had a great time here. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They have a laid back atmosphere but are still professional. Manager's Favorite Philly! Best thing to eat!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to home, we would be visiting all the time!  Service is great.  Place is huge and clean, there is a nice outdoor patio that allows smoking.  Tons of TVs everywhere and each table has a TV on it, very cool and a unique experience.  Food was very good, I had a classic french dip, perfection.  And my husband had a club sandwich which was HUGE, I could not get my mouth to open enough to get  a bite.  Fries were perfect.  There is a hostess that sit high up, poor girl was so board, why do you need a hostess in a bar?   Next time we are on that side of town we will visit again"}
{"text":"Waiting for 20 mins and no one acknowledged us. Had to ask a girl where our waitress was.  food came in about 15 mins. It was 'ok.' I had the rocky point tacos. First time here and was disappointed in the service. The place looks nice. Now waiting another 20 mins for the check. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"So we came here for the Trivia, we'll be coming back for the Trivia!  I ordered the Rocky Balboa and my girlfriend ordered the the prime rib sliders.  Now the reason why we get three stars is because the service was lacking and menu needs to be adjusted since they don't carry Modelo anymore!  Our server was this chick, obviously trying to edgy with a side cut...but when you got a side cut it needs to be shaved and have some nordic tattoo like Natalie Dormer in the Hunger Games!  Basically I had ordered my Rocky Balboa with my girlfriend's beer as I hadn't looked at the beer list yet.  Like, this is why they have receipts in diners so you can write it down!  Trivia continues and I go...this is some bullshit, we took second and not because of me...or maybe it was, who knows.  The Rocky Balboa though, bunless burger with lettuce, avocado and, and tomato.  I was all about it, you see the prime rib sliders...pretty good for thinking it was chopped pork ha.  Food good, Trivia good, Servers need work."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch twice this week and I enjoyed it very much. The food is good and the service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I gave this four-star rating not because it was absolutely the best but I know that they just opened and their food was pretty decent so I'm thinking it's only going to get better. The fries and Philly cheesesteak were really good the wings were a little soggy but their sauces were great."}
{"text":"Good sports bar atmosphere. Cozy and attentive service. Reasonably priced and good bar food. Outdoor patios and plenty of Tv's. Good neighborhood place to catch a game and some grub."}
{"text":"Don't order the mozzarella sticks. Room temp & soggy..yuck. Service was ok, as was atmosphere. Clean bathrooms.   I won't be sad if I never come here again."}
{"text":"Sigh...wish I could give more stars but here's the story. Went there Saturday for a friend's bday and had a good time. Drinks were good (had the seasonal blueberry wheat beer) and the wings were fantastic (garlic buffalo). It was low key and just what our group of 8 needed. Service was great!  We went to pick up our car Sunday morning and decided lets grab brunch since we noticed a sign that they had Sunday brunch at 10:30. We walked in and the place was dead. One guy at the bar and one table in the bar area. The server yelled across the restaurant to sit wherever you want so we chose an outdoor table on the patio (it's 75 degrees; who wouldn't want to sit outside?). We waited a few minutes and the waitress came over and gave us menus. She didn't include the brunch menu which confused me since they have posters plastered everywhere about offering brunch and she didn't offer a kids menu even though we had our 2 year old son. I asked for both and she brought them over. She then asked for drink orders and got mine and my husbands but again never asked for my son's. Ok, it's a sports bar, I get it, kids aren't their specialty, but you aren't busy and don't have anyone else to tend to so why not take the time with the one table you have? She dropped off our drinks and that was literally the last time we saw her. We waited 15 minutes, looking inside for her, making eye contact multiple times with the bartender and other servers who were clearly not busy either. Finally, we said forget and walked inside to pay for the one soda my husband got. We told the bartender what happened and all the servers immediately starting asking was that my table? Who's table was that? The bartender said she would get our soda and apologized so we left.   Not sure but I'm guessing maybe this is partly why they are dead for brunch. Too bad because the food was pretty good on Friday, but we ended up going across the street to Hillside Spot. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated but the difference in service was apparent as soon as we walked through the door."}
{"text":"Philly's is an excellent place to catch your typical sports game, notable soccer match or UFC fight. The restaurant area is a decent size with TVs everywhere especially the inside bar area. Outside, there's tons of seating all around the patio including a rounded bar. What makes Philly's special is the huge pop-up screen on the patio featuring the main event of the evening. I've been there once for an international soccer match and again for UFC fights. Both were showcased on nearly every TV in the place including the screen. It's so big you can see it from across the street. I highly recommend this above average sport's bar!  UFC Fights -5 dollar cover (ATM inside) -Get there early because seating goes fast. Though, we showed up late and found a secluded table with a TV just for us!  Food -We ordered the bbq and honey wings. They were crispy and above average. The honey wings used real honey, which was neat.  Service -The first time I went, it was sub-par. In their defense, the bartender said two waiters called in sick and it was an unusually large crowd for a weeknight.  -The second time, our waitress was diligent about checking on us even though we didn't order very much. Much improved!  Great Happy Hour from 4-7pm. Nice assortment of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Phillys is a fantastic sports bar. We went there on a Thursday night for Thursday night football between the Cardinals and the Vikings. The place was packed, but Tori, the best hostess in the world, found us a table within minutes. Phillys has the best selection of HDTVs I have ever seen in a sports bar with the television at every booth, and large HDTVs everywhere in the bar. They also have a nice patio with its own bar. The bar inside is large and accommodates many people. The food was fantastic. I had the Philly deluxe which included Angus beef, mushrooms, grilled onions, and Bell peppers. It had white and yellow cheese mixed in and melted on the thinly slice beef. It was without a doubt the best Philly cheesesteak sandwich I've ever had in my life. We will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"This lunch-time recommendation came courtesy of one of my culinary co-horts. Six of us set out for Philly's Sports Grill last Friday. I had never been to Philly's before, but word was this is a pretty cool place and they had really good cheesesteaks. Unfortunately, this visit only lived up to half of my expectations.  Philly's is on the outer boundary of travel distance for lunch options near work. We were kind of expecting that it would push the definition of \"lunch hour\". And it did.  But before that, let's discuss first impressions. The front room where we sat is nice and modern and has A LOT of televisions. If you like being bombarded with sports, I recommend you check this place out. Our server mentioned some ongoing renovations (which explained why a sound system speaker was sitting in our booth).  More first impressions. My menu was disgustingly dirty. It was splattered with dipping sauces and was sticky. I'm sorry, but how exactly does ketchup get on a menu unless it is left on the table as a placemat? Or never wiped. Regardless, I found my entree and was excited to finally try an \"Original Cheesesteak\" with actual cheez whiz.  We waited for our drinks. And we waited for our orders to be taken. We also waited a very long time for the food to arrive. I wasn't surprised when my sweet potato waffle fries were \"warm\" at best. The cheesesteak though, was very good. It was simple and tasty, having only diced onions and the aforementioned cheez whiz. It was decently warm, but the meat was a little on the chewy side. Sadly, this sandwich was the difference between two and three stars.  In the end, we took a 90 minute lunch break. Because our server was nice (but slow) and because I saw the potential in my cheesesteak, I would give Philly's another shot. Just not at lunch time."}
{"text":"First time here we had the breakfast burrito and an omelette with a visit to the Bloody Mary bar. Food was above average, service is very good and you can't beat this spot for watching the game!   Second visit we are trying the sweeter side of breakfast...waffle for me and pancakes for him. Both come with 2 eggs and a side of bacon or sausage for under $10, can't beat that!   The servings are very generous and prices are right. It was clean both times and we're able to get a table right away both mornings. Make sure to check out this well run sports bar."}
{"text":"As a native to Philly, I need to have my cheesesteak fix. Service was fast, food was good (although its not an original cheesesteak) and the prices weren't bad either. Their curly fries w/ a side of ranch are the best!   Can't wait to go back to try their wings."}
{"text":"I shared the sampler platter with my boyfriend. We chowed down on jalapeno poppers, onion rings, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and wings. I never knew bar food could taste this good! I loved the down to earth atmosphere, great food, and reasonable prices. I can't wait to come back and try the Philly sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Came with my family and all of our four dishes were great. Philly Cheesesteak, grilled chicken , meatball sliders  & cheeseburger.  Great $4 drink specials. Would've given 5 but service could've been better."}
{"text":"We had a Great Visit to Philly's Wed Afternoon Wed is All Day Happy Hour We had the Wings They were Yum 5 Bucks Onion Rings Excellent 5 Bucks. Then Shared  a PHILLY Cheese Steak-- Delish !! Came w Seasoned Fries Also Great Really Liked the Décor TVs Everywhere including our Super Comfy Super Sized Booth Your Own Personal TV !! Because We had decided this was lunch Dinner We Shared a Dessert  Brownie Sundae HOLY COW It was Yuge YUGE.   Service was Excellent  We just moved to.Tempe at the First of year so we are still in Explorer Mode.  We say Two thumbs up here Way Up !!"}
{"text":"After not going here for about a year, I found myself a bit disappointed. In my time away, they changed their menu. While the food is still delicious, I found that the portion was a lot smaller. I have always ordered some version of their original Philly, and have always appreciated the ability to order different sizes. Now they only offer one size, and I found it had less steak and more bread. I will be back, but I may stay away from the Philly."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall bar! Has a really neat atmosphere on the patio. Our server was awesome! Very attentive and friendly. And our waters were never empty. I gave this four stars instead of 5 because the food was alright. Pretty good for bar food though!"}
{"text":"Great environment, sat on the patio and watched the playoff games. Good food and great beer selection! Good specials for breakfast on weekends and great happy hour if you're like us and drink your way from happy hour all the way to reverse happy hour!  Definitely would recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Cigarettes and cigars is the name of the game!  This is the place to be if you smoke or enjoy 2nd hand smoking with your children, who run around with wild abandon and total impunity!!!"}
{"text":"Fun spot. If you're looking for a place to watch a game. Whether it's local, or national, this spot is the place to be. The set up is great, indoor and a large outdoor patio with a long bar top. They also have a few fire pits if you've got a group and want to sit around the fire. When you get there, you'll seat yourself. So don't be that awkward person that stands by the door waiting for a hostess. Shortly after seating yourself you will be approached by your server for drinks. The selection of beer is decent. Great pricing. Local ASU games are fun to watch here as well"}
{"text":"What can you say about Philly's- how about the food is so good that you almost forget you're in a sports bar! Chef Carl really has The menu dialed in!  You can go for the sports the beer the drinks the bar but you'll really enjoy the food!  What a great place to have lunch or dinner and catch a sporting event.  The staff is excellent , friendly and the ownership is super accommodating just great people!   No other sports bar compares in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in... And now come back often.  Tasty.  Fair prices.  Give it a chance."}
{"text":"I love this bar. There is a great selection of beers, the food here is good, the staff is friendly, a great atmosphere, and there are tvs at every table that you can control yourself! There is a nice patio and they are dog friendly. This is by far my favorite bar in the area!"}
{"text":"Cheesteaks are HUGE and come in tons of different varieties.  I had the deluxe-jalapenos, mush, green pepper, banana peppers.  For 9 bucks it was delish and service was great.  Sides good as well. Side note-a lot of TVs, but not the very modern TVs for sports."}
{"text":"Great service and the best BLT & A I've ever had! I will most definitely be coming back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar I frequent often.  Best wings - teriyaki wings well done...they're so addicting.  Atmosphere is good, love hitting up ping pong or bag toss."}
{"text":"If you want consistent service, don't go there. Maybe, they just want to sell beer? Four of us w/menus, sat for 45+ before waitress showed to take order. Took 1 order and abruptly left. 20 min's later, asked a bartender to find her? When confronted her, she laughed, no apology for lack of attention. Started to take order by memory, and realized she couldn't -- then started completely over w/paper. Order delivered by runners, came out wrong, and they asked us to make the change of sides on the plates. Great service is 50% of the experience. They have so much competition in the area, we won't be back soon--too many other great choices!"}
{"text":"Had the Philly cheesesteak and it was great. Oniong rings didn't taste fresh but my co-worker had garlic fries and said they were great. He thought the buffalo wrap was made with frozen chicken. Good value priced meal. Was spent about 15 with tip and drink."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with 2 others during a business trip as this is close to our training facility. Walked in, seated ourselves. No one acknowledged us for about 25 minutes, took even longer to get our food. Food was typical bar food. We ended up having to take it with us because it took so long. Also wasn't checked on and had to walk our check to be cashed out. Haven't returned since."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are from out of town.... They take advantage of you. I had friends who was there and told us to go. When we went as party of 3 and ran in to our friends a party of 2.. the waitress was really rude but we we're with their friends and having a good time then the bill came and she added 30 percent to everyone's order, we asked what was up and they said house rules we can do whatever we want. So there are several places that like visitors and don't want to screw them and we are no college kids were all in her fifties so Philly's screw off we will take our business elsewhere and being punished for spending more than $100 shame on you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, well priced, and good food. The best thing is the staff, Chelse was the kindest most attentive bar tender I've ever met, 5 star service."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak was filled with some kind of ground-up meat, mixed with onions and (I think) green bell peppers, soaked in Cheese Whiz on a cold bun, with a cold order of fries. The 12 or 16 large-screen TVs around the dark room weren't enough, so the owners decided to pipe in loud music, along with a separate TV at each booth."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would Lynette bartender manager whoever she is. She is the worst very rude. Takes care of her drunk falling of the bar customers then says you can't have a drink (while very sober) because her drunk customer says you are drunk. Why don't you try removing that drunk wobbly guy at the bar and do your job instead of getting rid of actual customers. You are horrible at your job and don't know how to handle people. To the owner if this is any indication you should fire her she is horrible and you will not get anymore customers because of her."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon and got seated immediately, which worried me a little that it wasn't packed.  However, that fear quickly departed as our food came out quickly, the waitress was very personable and the food tasted amazing!  I had the Manager's Special Philly Cheesesteak and it was delicious!  It was a great Arizona spin on an already great piece of Americana!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Good food and reasonable prices. Great lunch spot and a place to watch a game."}
{"text":"We come here for lunch often, and it's always a toss up. The regular lady is either the sweetest thing on earth, or she's the rudest waitress ever. You never know what you're going to get service wise. Have always liked my food here, but sad they took away the curly fries.   The place use to smell moldy, but they pulled up all the carpet and that went away. Great update."}
{"text":"Went for the philly game. Loved the tv on our table. Staff was friendly. Margarita pizza was just ok. Probably wouldn't order again. Caesar salad with chicken (1/2 order--plenty of food). Chicken was dry. 2 chicken tacos, tasty but not enough salsa. 1 chicken taco 1 Carne Asada taco. Chicken was dry, Carne was so tough and chewy barely could eat. Not enough salsa. Enchilada soup was good, not great Lots of chicken, good flavor, good portion. Guacamole burger was large but over salted. Onion rings were delish. Chef needs to work on his food. Prices are reasonable. We will give them another try because it is close by. Lots of food options."}
{"text":"Philly's is a great spot for beers on the patio if you live in the South Scottsdale/North Tempe area. You can run up a big bill faster than you realize because the pitchers are more expensive, but also larger, than those at most other places.  The service is great. I always feel taken care of by the wait staff and bartenders.  The menu is standard pub food done at a reasonable quality, but none of it is anything to write home about. I recommend the cobb salad with crispy chicken or the sliders with horseradish. If you want to go vegetarian, you'll have to look a bit harder and modify an existing menu item, or just get some garlic fries to tie you over until you get home.  A-OK is actually the best way to describe this place."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere.  Tvs everywhere and the food is good and very reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here a dozen times or so a year for probably 10 yrs. Bartender Mary always remembers me, knows what I drink, and is pleasant and more than capable. I always have the Philly sandwich (well, duh), and it's every bit as good as Pats or Genos in Philadelphia. They melt the cheese on the meat and then chop it up and it just melts in your mouth. It may be the bread that makes it exceptional, bit, whatever, it's awesome.   I guess they are remodeling, and I sure hope they don't lose the dive bar vibe. Lots of tvs, good wifi, what else do you need?"}
{"text":"Many a Wed night after lacrosse we've doubled their business. Tonight they arbitrarily decide under 21 can't sit on the patio. Manager's response when we said it's never been an issue before: \"It is tonight.\" Way to run off half of a slow weeknight's business forever, bonehead."}
{"text":"We had such a sweet waitress and some great drinks, and their curly fries and garlic fries are great, but the phillys were a flop compared to Corleone's and forefather's...  Total bummer, I would come back for a fun time, but I will be ordering something else..."}
{"text":"Great outdoor bar with alot of Tv's really friendly staff with quick service, all in all when I go to spring training baseball it's the one place I always visit"}
{"text":"I actually like the ambiance because of the TV's and the outside patio area but the service sucks! Every time I go, I have to find a waitress even when it's not busy. When I find a waitress,  they don't make it a point to check in. I've had to walk to the bar to get what I need even though I have a waitress assigned to my table.  My family and I were there tonight for Sunday night football.  I had to go to the bar to refill my son's water, I had to get up and find my waitress to ask for ketchup and I had to get her again to ask for another beer even though she was at the bar (she didn't turn around to check on us). There are a couple of bartenders that are aware and have made it a point to tell the team, \"make sure you go check on them.\" In other words, there is no proactive approach and the attitudes are \"like whatever.\" The food is nothing out of the ordinary,  just regular \"ok\" bar food. Cheesy bread is good and selection of beer is good."}
{"text":"This is one of three Philly's. Great tvs and cool vibe. Great pork philly and get the crab fries. The California chicken sandwich with side salad is a nice healthier option. Great patio and patio bar."}
{"text":"Come here often with friends. Mostly to watch a UFC fight or broncos game.  But good place to go grab a ice cold beer and they have amazing food."}
{"text":"I really like this place. This place is a good place to come watch a game or UFC or just for getting some food. They have tv's everywhere and the bar is inside and goes outside for those of you who would like to enjoy a smoke at the bar like the good  ol days you can do that here. They have the game Bags set up for anyone to play. Thay also have a ping pong table, pool table, and they even have a breathalizer in the hallway to the restrooms so you can make sure your ok to drive. Its cool and funny cause Arizona is a 0 tollerance state so you can blow a .02 and be busted even thou the limit is .08. I know someone who was busted for blowing .02. Anyway they have a huge patio with the firepits for the cooler weather and great drink specials. I had the philly cheese steak and loved it. They also have a good chicken philly. Cream cheese jalopeno poppers and wings are good to. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We ate here three times whole in town.  Loved the atmosphere.  Had on all the games we wanted to watch.  The chicken teriyaki sandwich is AMAZING!!  We also has the club, quesadilla and wing all of which were very tasty.  Drinks were poured well and affordable.  Service was great.  Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing Philly Cheese Steak Sandwiches & good selection of beers.  I use to come here more often when I lived close, and I would continue to stop by if I lived nearby still.  The food is so good, I still will show up during times I am in the neighborhood.  The management of this place do a great job, Autumn & Jessica always give amazing service when me & my buddy show up.  This place probably really deserves 5 stars, the only reason why I gave it 4 instead is because there have been a few times (not a lot) that some bar tenders & waitresses that work there were not the greatest at quality service.  However, don't let a few spoil it for this place, keep in mind Jessica & Autumn with their management leaders are the best (I would say Savannah too, but she no longer works there; she was awesome).  If you like a good sports bar with awesome food & good times, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Phillys is a good sportsbar in Ahwatukee. The food is bar food and fine and the service is consistently slow....buuut...it is the best outdoor patio around! It is always fun and the space is great.  They stay up on their sports events and you will always find the UFC fights here.   At the end of the day if your looking to be outside with friends in a fun atmosphere and not in any hurry Philly' s is the place!"}
{"text":"First, we called for a takeout order...Waited on the phone for 3 minutes each time for someone to hang up on us again. When we finally got a worker to take our order, we were told the wait would be 30 minutes. We arrived on time and had to wait for our food at the bar for another 30 minutes until the food was brought out. All of the sauces that we had ordered on the phone call were not included inside of the bag at all. Both of the salads we ordered had chicken included...That was not even cut up. They were in huge chunks of meat, and OF COURSE, there was no silverware in our bag even to attempt to cut the chicken up.  -Salad was missing cheese and the lettuce was pretty much still in a giant block of wedge. -Purchased a large cheesy bread, and they forgot to add any marinara at all."}
{"text":"Came here to watch some UFC fights (party of 3) and the atmosphere was fun. Each booth comes with a TV of its own and you are able to watch the sporting event of your choice.  The waitresses were accommodating and the overall service was excellent. So far, so good. Why the 3 stars? The food here is awful. For being named \"Philly's,\" one would assume that they make a decent Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. NOPE. Undercooked veggies, stale bread, and under-seasoned meat are not the best ingredients for a Philly Cheesesteak.   I would definitely recommended this place to watch sports and drink. However, I will not be ordering off the menu next time."}
{"text":"Good spot for checkin out any game on tv, good beer, good food, good people's. All the high tops have their own tv with remote that you can watch whatever you want if the wall lined with bigscreen TVs doesn't suit you."}
{"text":"High rating because of the staff. Have yet to have a bar tender who hasn't introduced them selves and been super polite and attentive. The food is good, beer selection is goo, staff are excellent. Great neighborhood spot or place to stop by when in the area. Very happy Phillys is here and not the old place."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We were first timers yesterday and will definitely be back!  The menu was large and great choices. The server we had was very friendly, fun and attentive. We asked for a game on a TV and they happily obliged.   We loved the Philly sandwiches!!!!"}
{"text":"We love that each booth has its own television.  Good food.  Great service.  Perfect neighborhood joint!"}
{"text":"This place is walking distance to my home. I mostly just stop by for the cold beers. Service is always friendly and attentive. It's a relaxed environment, the outside patio has fire pits. Great beer variety and I love the basket of fries."}
{"text":"Amazing staff! They are always on their A game. Bartenders are super sweet and attentive even when they are slammed. Trivia night is a blast and the upstairs game area is super nice!"}
{"text":"The ribs (only offered on Thurs) are wonderful! I had a BLTA but the \"B\" (a HUGE ingredient)  seemed to be really scarce. I had opened second half of sandwich to show my husband when manager walked up to check on us, so I showed her. She said, \"do you want more bacon?\" We had already finished eating. I wanted more than 1/2  slice of bacon in the sandwich. She said she'd give feedback to kitchen. No offer of any type of compensation (a drink, dessert, I'm sorry).  We really like this place. Most food is fine (bar food). Bartenders JT and JoJo are great. Don't order the BLTA."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood sports bar. Friendly staff and good management. Enjoy the pingpong n bags games for outside patio"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch, it was kinda busy and only one server that was also tending bar. We grabbed a beer but didn't have time to order food. We picked up  some Carls Jr and hit the road.  Usually a great spot in the hood for a quick bite and I understand short staffing. Our server was fine, but busy, very busy."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale Philly's is by my house and I kind of refuse to go, bad reviews, looks like dump, million other places to go, but I saw on Yelp that this Philly's is a little bit newer and has decent reviews. Either way, I was pretty disappointed. The waitresses were nice, and attentive but the food was not very food. Also it took us 3 tries to finally order a beer that they have on draft and listed on their menu. Just update your menu, its not that hard! The mozzarella sticks were decent, but the wings lacked flavor and the bleu cheese had zero flavor, not even worth the calories. But the happy hour prices are decent. And the set up of the bar was pretty cool. Every table has a TV and remote at it. I would maybe come back for drinks only, not food."}
{"text":"So you know what, I really liked it and the feel.  Definitely a \"local\" place vibe but with lots of travelers coming in and out, but certainly not the \"swanky\" traveler.  Stephanie was tending bar, who genuinely seemed to be enjoying her time there and she really knew the customers, greeting them and getting their usual if she knew it.  This place is nothing to look at, but still was fun.  Plenty of TVs as well playing sports.  Ended up ordering a huge salad that was actually very tasty and fresh, served in a really nice dish.  Got what I thought would be a small 10\" meat pizza that ended up being a really good sized 8 slice pizza.  It was descent and worth ordering again.   For me, as a wayward traveler staying nearby it was really worth the stop and would do it again!"}
{"text":"Customer service, attentiveness, aesthetic and food are always absolutely perfect. The crew here are what bring me back time and time again. A very special kuddos to Nicole & Brittany. Always remember my orders, names and preferences. If you're looking for a chill atmosphere and first class experiment, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday to watch the SC game with a friend.  I hate SC and he loves them so he was excited to see all the SC alumni packed inside.  It was too filled with Trojans inside for us to grab a table so we had to sit at the outside bar.  Our bartender was amazing!  Her name is Savannah and she is my drunken soul mate.  I loved hearing about her night, and we compared pictures of our drunken times on our cameras.  She's really cool and attentive, and a little bit of a drink pusher.  But I don't mind, I love getting drunk so I'm happy!  I am definitely coming back again, just for her!"}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar. Food is good, fine bar food. If you are expecting to e blown away, don't. Expect good bar food.   The beer menu has expanded, including more and better beers as time has gone on. I have been coming here for almost 5 years now.  The staff is a little dodgy as they seem to be way more wrapped up in whatever they have going on than attending tables. However, once they recognize that you've been waiting they're real nice and usually make some generous drinks.   Nice pool table and great TV set up. It is difficult to have a bad time here, it is however equally difficult to have an amazing time."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, not so great wings... BUT their cheese steak sammies are passable and hey, $4 appetizers at happy hour and $2.75 beers. For that I will just not order the ucky wings and get something I am less attached to. Service good, atmosphere good. Seemed to be a lot of 50 something dudes around. Don't know why, will see if that's a trend...not that it matters or anything. You single ladies over forty might wanna come spend some time at the bar...  If you like deep fried bar foods cheap, come at happy hour. The outside patio is real nice. Lotsa smoke. Games on lots of TVs. Everything tastes better at happy hour..."}
{"text":"What a difference a little lighting can make.    I liked the old Public House Garage and Philly's has done well to not alter the space too much.  They've added some lighting to brighten it up and they're making alterations to the outside bar.  The beer selection is pretty good, happy hour runs 4-7p (drinks and select apps), and the food is good (for sports bar food).    Most of the booths have their own TV and remote to watch whatever games you want.  This will be a huge hit during football season.  They'll need to work out the sound as they kept playing music during football games which was upseting some tables.  Eventually they figured it out but the sound was low and not clear.    That said, the service was solid and friendly.  All told, it's a good start.  Let's hope they keep it up!  It's no surprise if you've been to this shopping center before but the parking situation is -37 stars."}
{"text":"A customer of mine recommended this place to me a couple months back so when a friend and I made plans to meet for lunch I suggested this place.  We got there around 11:30 and while it wasn't packed there were definitely more people than I was expecting for a place that had only been open for 30 minutes so far on a Thursday morning.  The sign at the door said seat yourself so we did and as we were putting our stuff down a friendly waitress came over and handed us our menus and asked about drinks.  We decided to start with waters in order to give us time to peruse the menu for a couple minutes.  Now, personally I feel it would be wrong to go to a place called Philly's and NOT order a cheese steak so I decided to go with the Original Philly which was meat, cheese wiz and grilled onions.  My friend decided on a tuna melt and I tried to avoid eye contact for a little bit so she wouldn't see the look of disappointment in my face.  I liked that there is a big selection of items you get to choose from for the side dish as well.  I went with curly fries and she got onion rings but you could also choose from fruit, steak fries, coleslaw, a salad and a few other things too!  Our food came out pretty quickly and I knew it was gonna be good as soon as I saw the meaty, melty goodness oozing out of it onto the plate.  The roll it was on was perfectly toasted, lightly crispy but still soft, the thing was loaded with meat and the meat itself was super flavorful and then of course you can't go wrong with cheese wiz.  I'm not even embarrassed to admit I ate the whole thing.  I was originally just going to finish half and save the rest for later but it was so good I couldn't resist.  The curly fries were great too, nice and crispy with a good flavor.  Our waitress was great the whole time too, always smiling when she came up to us, good with keeping our drinks filled and checking to make sure we had everything we needed.  My only regret is that I didn't come here sooner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here, food was really good and the drinks were good as well.  The service was nice and took good care of us.  We liked this place so much we went two nights in a row.  Burgers, pasta, chicken tenders all were really good"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour and it's right in between Tempe and Scottsdale so good location. Happy hour is 4-7, $3 pints and $3.50 premium drafts, appetizers are $4.50. Atmosphere is very casual and fun, huge outdoor patio as well."}
{"text":"Updating my review because I met someone there not long ago and the beer was cold this time. The food seemed more acceptable and a pizza the guy next to me ordered looked quite good, but I didn't eat any pizza.  Bartender was friendly.  There are too many sports bars around to run one that's only OK.  The way it is now, I think it will probably be popular when they are showing a fight or hosting alumni for some college football. Other than that, I'm guessing they'll get a smattering of locals (including me now and then) but it will never be a destination place for a lot of people."}
{"text":"My three topping Philly with cole slaw lunch ($9.95) was delicious, with plenty of very tasty beef on a fresh bun. The service was friendly, fast, and cheerful. There were TVs everywhere, including every booth, with great background music (not too loud). Very nice!"}
{"text":"Good eats, drinks , service and atmosphere.  Love the happy hour  Had the tacos. All the meat choices were good Def recommend it and will keep going back Glad to have it close to my house"}
{"text":"Best restaurant/bar that's been in this plaza since Shannon Alexander's 15 years ago! The Deluxe Philly Cheesesteak w/Onion rings and my wife had the French Dip with Crab Fries. This's our NEW favorite place in Ahwatukee.  If you don't come here for the food, come here for the staff. They're very warm and friendly as well as helpful. They're definitely working hard and doing their jobs. Thanks Josh and Scott and now Chelsea!   Every time I come here I like it more!"}
{"text":"This place is trash. Service sucks. Food sucks even more and the place needs remodeling. It's decor is outdated. Don't come here for lunch and sit on the bar unless you want to sit next to loud, arrogant, rude and drunk of their ass annoying guys rooting for a basketball team nobody's ever hear of."}
{"text":"My opinion if you wouldn't work somewhere why would you eat here! After filling out an application that took me longer to fill out than the bar manager took to speak with me, I was told I wouldn't make money here. After thinking that didn't go well I was given a call back for a second interview. (Well maybe the girl was intimidated.) It was scheduled and I was completely blown off. After arriving early I was told I wouldn't be interviewed because the manager 3was called into a meeting, would I reschedule. NO! This place is a joke. Everyone's time is valuable, as I drove 30 minutes to be there, and rearranged my entire day to make this work and wasn't even given a courtesy phone call to reschedule. I will not be returning or spending money here. If this is how they treat people it really makes me feel sorry for the other employees."}
{"text":"Come here often and get good service generally as we are recognized.  Always immediately greeted at door when you walk in and the bar staff are very good as well as attentive and friendly.  Great patio when it is cooler as long as it's not overwhelming with smokers."}
{"text":"It's such a change to go back to your \"go to\" place of years prior and then experience a change in foods. My group of close friends used to always frequent here...   Now? The food isn't the same... It's all about the BREAD to start. The bread now? Great. Not NYC/PA great but it's good.   I will say that I loved the wings. YummmMEEEEE!   Another positive note, the staff was friendly and attentive. That to me is so important. Super. Really really super!   But still... Change I know is good. I just miss my place from days of old."}
{"text":"Impressed with this place.   Great menu and customer service.   Pricing is dead on.  Inviting for those outside sports crowd.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a new local place to enjoy. Our son suggested Philly's, it did not disappoint.  We enjoyed the wings, beer, and you can't beat a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"God awful food. Had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was by far the worst wrap I've ever had in my life. It was like eating a rubber chicken with awful sauce on it. Service was good but will never be back after tasting that food. Wouldn't feed it to my dog."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food menu really good price.  Plenty of TVs with sports on.  Staff willing to change the game you want to the TV near you.  Great service and food."}
{"text":"For $18 they have a 10 Oz sirloin with asparagus, a baked potato, and a challah roll.  My steak was ordered medium and cooked perfectly.  Great meal for a great price"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good happy hour. The happy hour lasts until 7pm. There are plenty of TVs to watch everying sporting event. This place can get crowded quickly. I did not order any food so I cannot tell you about that."}
{"text":"American food. The service was really slow when we ordered. I ordered the buffalo salad and it was nothing special. I liked the spice of the sauce. Was disappointed with how slow and uncrowded it was for a week day and it's near businesses. I want to go back here for happy hour and enjoy some sports here."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house so I will walk here occasionally for some food and a beer. Everything about this place is disappointing! Everything I have ever had here has lacked in flavor or  has been stale and overcooked. Worse than the food is the service if you are not a regular you really don't exist to these servers, I asked for ketchup and she rolled her eyes and took her sweet time bringing it out."}
{"text":"2nd time there. Food and service still awesome. I love pomodoro sauce and there's is the best I've ever had. Great service. Good prices. Awesome music. Fantastic food. Great Ahwatukee place."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports! There's a TV and remote at each table! At least in the bar there is. I wanted to watch the Cubs day game and my first stop was the Brewery up the street that has TVs. But only local channels. So no Cubs game. So I left and remembered Philly's which I have not been to for years. Imagine my delight to find the Cubs game on the large TV as well as at my table where I have full control of the channels. Besides the Cubs losing, my whole experience at Philly's was pretty great. Mary at the bar and my server was awesome. I'll review the food after a few more visits because I'll be back. All I had was something really odd that jumped out at me off the menu. Deep fried green beans. Don't see that every day. Comes with two sauces. Huge order. Too much for one person so I'll be eating them for a late night snack. Not too greasy and tastes pretty good. Probably goes great with a beer..but I don't drink during the day. Look forward to coming back for a burger and a Dbacks game."}
{"text":"Great local hangout with a doggo friendly patio."}
{"text":"Best in AZ. Not authentic Philly cheese steak BUT is a really good steak and cheese...t just like you get anywhere in New England. If you want a real Philly CS..GO THERE! Great onion rings n fries too."}
{"text":"Went for a mayweather fight, $10 was definitely acceptable for the amount of tv's in the place. Food was good and a lot of draft beer specials. Recommended for fights for sure"}
{"text":"A little upset. We paid 200 dollars for 4 of us to watch the fight. We picked our table inside not outside to avoid the heat. All door left open we sweated our butts off. We asked why it was so hot and the waitress stated her boss said bc it is. Highly disappointed. It was a lot of money to spend in this establishment."}
{"text":"Came to Phillys to meet up with friends Not my decision And I have to admit it was kinda sketchy But It's a pretty good sized, sports bar... Our server Lauren was so nice and friendly. Their happy hour specials are really great for food and drinks... I ended up getting the cheese bread which I thought was like breadstick style cheese bread... But it ended up being like a whole cheese pizza... And it was really good :) I think it could feed 2-4 people...  And I ate it all alone I also had whiskey and cokes with my dinner which was pretty good... Lauren was very nice and checked on us every now and then to see if we were doing good...  My friends got the surf and turf which looked really good... The wings looked ok, I didn't try, but I will next time...   All in all, I would suggest Philly's happy hour to anyone..."}
{"text":"It was ok. Nothing special. We ordered the Rocky Balboa to go...it's been 35 mins. It should not take that long to cook a burger!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and think this place is great. The bartenders and servers are great and stay on top of the orders.   People at the bar are friendly the overall atmosphere is good and upbeat, the food is good too."}
{"text":"Went to phillys because they were playing the mayweather vs maidana fight. The food and drinks were good and were a fair price. They could use more seating as they were packed. I was impressed with our waitress who had a huge section to help and she was really on top of everyone. They charged 10 cover per person because of the fight and they stopped their normal Saturday happy hour because of the fight. That was my only complaint-I get the fight costs money but they made at least 10 times their money back just by cover and then they take away happy hour too?! Other than that, we were pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"USED to come here often. No more. With Fate up the street, we have some place nice to go for a good beer without being extorted for $$ at the door for a fight we don't care to watch. Do yourself a favor and go a half mile up the street to Fate."}
{"text":"My partner was in the mood for beer and wings... ok, it's hot outside let's just go someplace close and locally owned.  Philly's was it!  I ordered a sausage calzone, and asked it to be baked a bit less than a hard crust... thought I'd ask... don't know how they normally do it.   It was big and delicious, and my leftovers were perfect for baking the next day!  My partner ordered bacon cheese fries (tasty tasty tasty) and wings.  Since we had hit happy hour, those were $4 dishes.  Wooo HOOOOO! The service was fantastic.  We had two servers checking on us all the time.  You know, we are just going to have to go there more often!"}
{"text":"Great place for sports lovers. Great selection of beer wrapped together with a variety of great food. Always feel welcome every time I go in there. Would suggest it to anyone looking to unwind with a couple drinks or looking for a delicious meal. Good work Phillys!"}
{"text":"Horrible stay away. Waitress had no idea what beer was on tap and it was happy hour. Poor wine selection. Bartenders don't know how to make a coffee and Kailua!! Brought plain coffee to the table and tried to charge me $7.00. Food was marginal. Service was terrible. Party of 7 and we all felt the same when we left."}
{"text":"I'm not one to visit a sports bar or any type of dive bar but my new customers invited me to come here, so I did!  We sat outside on the patio and because it was so hot, the misters felt great!  Drinks are inexpensive, along with the food.  We had a few appetizers between us and yes it was all fried food, but it wasn't too bad.  The thai chilli green beans were my favorite.  They were lightly fried and the sauce that came with them was great.  We also had the pretzels with 2 different cheese sauces and they had the fried pickles.  Lastly we ordered the cheese bread which was close to the size of a medium pizza.  The bread was lightly baked and came with a marinara sauce.  This is not a 4-5 star restaurant but for its category, it deserves a solid rating.  The staff are friendly and helpful, they have lots of different food and drink options and they have a good atmosphere.  The prices are great and I think my bill was around $60/70 for 3 appetizers and 6 drinks."}
{"text":"Philly's is your basic, no-frills sports bar. It is nothing to swoon over, but it is laid back and a fun hangout spot.  The staff was nice too, and it was actually really refreshing to not be surrounded by a bunch of Scottsdale a-holes."}
{"text":"Good service, variety of food and good selection on draft .. there's a tv on every booth that you can control the Channels ur self along with lots of big tvs"}
{"text":"Great service as someone that just came and was born and raised in northeast philly it's such a good bar and grill to honestly meet people and open yourself up congrats to the owners for being one of the best people I have personally I've ever met"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible, customer service. Never coming back again. Food was ok nothing special. Got cut off after 3 drinks, which was terrible. I truly believe waitress was racist for us being brown. Stay away from this place if you value self respect. Waitress name is Jordan. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Who would have thunk that at a place called \"Philly's\", I would have found the tastiest Taco Tuesday in the area?  Well, I did. Along with a decent selection on tap, and nice folks, this place deserves a 5, for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, layout, large T.V.s lining the walls. They have seating inside and out, with heaters for the infrequent colder nights. Have a Rocky Balboa burger and Pub fries or Pastrami buger, or..."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The staff is amazing and they keep the drinks flowing! Great place to watch the game on Sunday. Can't forget the Bloody Mary bar! Love it!"}
{"text":"Food was okay and server was beyond retarded. Had to ask multiple times for stuff. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Hott waitresses, hott wings, nice drinks and $$! I would go here all the time but im just visiting! :) I reccomend the hott wings!"}
{"text":"Pastrami sliders are phenomenal! I highly recommend that if you are a lover of pastrami check this place out!!"}
{"text":"An old school neighborhood sports bar with a huge smoker-friendly patio. This is a very low key place to get some pub grub and a buzz while watching your favorite team. Not being much of a sports fan, I still like it for it's laid back attitude and cheap drinks. $2 Miller High Life's all day every day!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sports bar in Tempe/Scottsdale. The food is great, the happy hour prices are unbeatable and they have rotating $2.50 pints of Mexican beer. The patio is great with heaters, fire pits, misters, and two sets of bags. There are great TVs throughout the bar, and it is relatively clean for this type of dive. Give it a shot and you wont regret it."}
{"text":"I've dined here once with a friend because he lives in the immediate area and loves coming here on a weekly-ish basis. Didn't know that until he told me recently.   I hadn't heard of this place until we decided to meet up have a dinner chat about an organization that we are leaders in. I really love how most of the restaurant is outdoors for our [mostly awesome] Arizona weather.   I sat down and was immediately greeted by the gal who ended up being our waitress. Since my friend hadn't arrived yet, she got me squared away with water, menus, and a brief overview of the food. It's your typical sports bar food, nothing too fancy that stood out. I didn't want anything too heavy so I opted for their buffalo chicken salad but bbq instead of buffalo. She didn't charge me extra for doing that. Super delicious, fairly plain though, but it hit the spot.   She was very courteous of our meeting discussions and didn't try to interrupt us. We ended up staying longer than I thought due to one of the games on TV going into crazy ridiculous overtime. Fun environment and worth checking out again."}
{"text":"I had to choose a 1 star rating since our waitress didn't put my order in (there were 5 of us) very disappointed. Not a place I would return."}
{"text":"Philly's #3 on Warner Rd. & 48th Street  Good local place.  Lot's of flat screen's...even on some of the tables.  Food is good, decent beer selection...I've only been in for lunch a couple times, but I imagine it would be a good spot to catch a game or a fight.  There's a large patio and outdoor bar just outside the roll up doors that have been open in the mild temperatures."}
{"text":"A very clean sports bar ambiance.  Nice seating options and patio. The traditional Philly is good. Love the pub fries. Will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with fries for pickup. There was a glitch in the online ordering process so I had to wait for a bit for my food, but the bartender was very nice and did everything she could to make my wait comfortable.   Food was good too; I would definitely order from here again and in spite of them starting my order when I got there, they were very fast getting me out the door."}
{"text":"Great local sports bar with an extensive selection of domestic and imported beers. The menu is very eclectic and they are always changing it up so stop in to see what's new and say hi to Ashley M., the best bartender they have."}
{"text":"We love to meet up with friends for Happy Hour and we get Happy!!! LOL . This is a local spot and it is also a great place to grab some grub and a cocktail and hang out . Pool table and other games to play out side and in the fall mths they have a fire pit out side to hang around... Just a GREAT place and good food."}
{"text":"Came here to have a good night with friends and family, after what was supposed to be a relaxing evening, turned into an ordeal. I previously won a $50 gift card from a charity event supporting a young child needing a transplant. When I went to use this gift card, the manager came out and said this card is not valid since I could not produce a receipt for the said purchased card that was won from a raffle. Even after I showed him the legitimate raffle event's website and contacted the event staffs coordinator, the card was only honored for half the valued price. The manager even admitted that there was record of the card being activated in their system and yet would not honor it. Over all I do not plan on making a return."}
{"text":"Not good.  My wing order was mixed up with the guy next to me at the bar.  I was fine, he was pissed.  Ordered a burger a bit later, but did not get it.   After I asked, about 30 minutes later - they \"found\" it.  Clearly sitting under a heat lamp for awhile. Sent it back, didn't look good. Let's face it, I can have leftovers at home.  I wish them well.  But they have some work to do."}
{"text":"So disappointing. I was so happy to have a fun new place to go, and they started off strong. Great cheesesteaks and other food, but the service (aside from JT and some of the other ladies behind the bar) is horrible. I may have to give up on this place. :("}
{"text":"I spent a pleasant Sunday afternoon at Philly Sports Grill. Because it was such a beautiful day, I sat outside. (The only downside was that all the smokers sat out there too). My server was Tori and she was so sweet! Very personable and accommodating. She recommended several items from the menu and I went with the Pastrami Sliders. I thought they were seriously good! In the interest of my waistline, i had a side salad. But when the adjacent tables order of French fries arrived, I realized that I had made a mistake! They looked amazing and smelled heavenly! Oh well! Next time! I don't get the 31/2 star review.. the service is good, it's a great place to watch sports, there is a huge menu with something for everyone and the food is good! It's a solid 5 in my book!"}
{"text":"Better then Zipps... But almost just as bad. Sometimes good food sometimes good service never anything great... And most the time the girls look at you like your some crazy creature that walked in the door and ignore you! Better food and atmosphere then Zipps tho... So they have that"}
{"text":"Great spot, love the music and atmosphere.  Enjoyed chicken nachos that were a nice serving size.  It was cold so I also tried Chef Carl's Chicken Enchilada Soup.  It was great and also a great portion.  Love Phillys!"}
{"text":"As a last minute decision we decided to go for happy hour on a Friday. As a neighborhood bar we were greatly impressed with the service and the patio seating was phenomenal.  But then again how can patio seating in AZ go wrong during the winter months?  At our table we had orders of the fish tacos, cheese and bacon covered French fries, the Philly steak and fish and chips. Everyone was pleaded and we will be back.   Kudos, Phillys. Thanks for a fun Friday."}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews so this will be short.  We came here on Saturday afternoon because Philly's does extended happy hour, 7 days per week.  Upon arrival, we find out they cancelled happy hour due to the UFC fight being shown even though the main event was still 2 hrs away.  We were there to cheap booze and grub and had no interest in the fight so we went to another sports bar for Happy Hour.  That sports bar was also showing the fight, but still had Happy Hour in place."}
{"text":"Found this gem of a B&G while vacationing in Arizona, it was within walking distance of our hotel (which met our criteria for the night b/c we'd been drinking already at the free happy hour).  Wasn't quite sure about them when we approached the door, from the outside it seems kinda shady, but walked in and found it was clean and didn't reek like most bars (especially the B&G on the grounds of our hotel - it should have been called the Ashtray B&G).  We decided to eat a meal there... and I must say I was very impressed with the menu selection and the quality of the food.  They had plenty of beer on tap, and like any good sports bar... plenty of TVs.  We ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer, and if I'd have known how good they were going to be...I would have skipped dinner and eaten only these (try the teriyaki wings, their SOOO good!!).  If you're staying in the Scottsdale area, give this place a try...they're right off of the strip and the service and the food were great.  I will definitely be eating there again when we go next year."}
{"text":"Sports bar near my house. Loved it. Fast friendly service.  Wasn't to busy on a mon night but that's why we came. Had the buffalo chick wrap with some perfectly crisp waffle fries. Yum yum. Nice healthy portion at a decent price. We will deffinently be back. Go Broncos!"}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak special....good price and nom nom nom. Shicara was super nice and always had a smile on her face."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, food was way better than anticipated, and our waitress was funny and helpful."}
{"text":"The wings here are so great!!! I've only had one bad experience here, the table next to me was dirty the entire time. Other than that I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like my lunch at Philly's. A friend of mine had been there the evening before, and while he wasn't wowed by his Philadelphia Cheese Steak, he indicated that he would go back and order it again. I suppose that was enough to get me to try it...  I showed up fairly early for lunch, and decided to sit at the bar since it wasn't very crowded. A very friendly bar tender/sever greeted me (Mary B), provided me with a menu and water with lemon. She made me feel totally welcome.  After giving me the few minutes I had requested to review the menu, she returned and offered to answer any questions I might have. I settled on an 8\" Cheesesteak with grilled onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, cherry peppers and provolone. Since she indicated that the cherry peppers weren't hot, I requested some jalapenos on the side. As a side dish I opted to have the side Caesar salad from among the options that she provided.  My food didn't take long. The salad looked good, and the sandwich arrived piping hot. Unfortunately, the Caesar salad dressing tasted more like green goddess dressing, and was bland and rather heavy. The lettuce was nice and crisp and fresh, but the dressing made the salad such an unpleasant experience that I didn't eat it beyond the first taste. I had really thought I'd enjoy the salad, so I was a bit let down.  My cheesesteak was ok. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good either. Adding the jalapenos to it gave it some additional flavor, but I think that a heavier helping of grilled onions may have helped. The sandwich bun was great, but the steak and veggies in the sandwich hadn't browned or caramelized at all, and while moist, my sandwich lacked any depth of flavor.   All in all, my cheesesteak was filling, but not very satisfying. My lunch overall, was just so-so.  Service was great, so I think I'll go back at some point in the future to see if perhaps they just had a bad day in the kitchen."}
{"text":"My family met here tonight to grab some food and catch up. There were 10 of us and they accommodated us on the patio. Vanessa was our server and she was fantastic. She helped us with the menu and was super funny. She handled us all ordering at different times like a champ. I've waited tables for 20+ years and needy tables are the worst but she was not bothered by us at all. When I come back, I'll definitely ask for her again. Ok, now the food. I had the bbq burger, cooked to perfection with sweet potato waffle fries. It was absolutely delicious. Mom had a chef salad, uncles had a club like sandwich and a french dip. Sisters had prime rib sliders and a chicken sandwich. Nephew got the philly cheesesteak. Everyone was happy with their choices. We also got all 3 cheese, meat and fruit boards which were 7 bucks each! Loaded with cheeses, all kinds, salami, prosciutto and  fresh fruit. A-MAZ-ING. I can't wait to go back! Only complaint was that stupid jenga game. They should put a rug underneath it so it's not so loud when it falls."}
{"text":"Love the waitresses and it's pretty good food as far as bar food is concerned. Love the Monday special and the football crowd. My fiancé go more than I would like to admit!"}
{"text":"Philly's is a great spot if you want to kick back with some good bar food and drinks.  I used to live in the apartments behind Philly's and would wall myself on over to post up at the bar.  Perfect.  Now I have moved further up into Scottsdale and still find myself posting up here.  They have a nice patio with the outside bar, TV's and of course misters!  The bartenders are always friendly and quick with service.  As far as food goes they actually have some pretty delicious bar food! Mozzarella sticks, potato skins, loaded fries, and the yummy wings!  They have that yummy creamy ranch that you could swish in your mouth.  Okay, that's a little overkill but it's really good. :)  They have good drink specials and if your order something that's not on special they will make a suggestion for what is (ie. Captain n' Coke, Sailor Jerry's n' Coke).  Everyone should appreciate that !  Don't pass this place up.  Especially if you like watching sports at the bar, it's worth going here.  Don't expect anything fancy though, it is a laid back bar so plan to just enjoy yourself with friends or alone at the bar is fine too."}
{"text":"I came here tonight deliberately to watch the UFC. Thanks to my Yelp mobile app, I quickly found this place near my hotel. Philly's is really great. The service was incredible, tons of flat screen TVs to watch the fights. They also had baseball and football on, which I did not care for. 90 percent of the patrons were in there for the UFC. The other 10 percent were just plain boring and pissy because the sound in the whole bar was STRICTLY for UFC! Hahaha I watched the whole game, drank a few beers, ate an INCREDIBLE Philly Cheesesteak. I was a little skeptical to try it because my boyfriend made me try the real thing in Philly. These were FANTASTICAL... wow, so flavorful with jalapeños and peppers and onions with cheezwiz. I think it had a lot more meat that the ones I had in Philly too! It was so big I couldn't finish more than half. I took the other half home.   If you are ever in Scottsdale/Tempe area, this is THE place to watch the game.  +1 for 2.50 draft beers!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place offers a variety of phillies and the two we had were really good. We actually ate here two nights in a row just to make sure we liked it. The first night we sat on the patio, but the second night we sat inside and the vibe was great. They were playing some really good music inside. We had the same server both nights and she was friendly. We'll come back to this place."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Plenty of TVs and decent decor, they also have a patio area. Food was alright, the French dip seemed like it had really cheap roast beef on it. The fries were good though. Worst part was the service, waitress seemed to have a bad attitude the whole time. Then when we asked her if she would honor a coupon that we had received from our apartment complex when we just moved it, she made a big deal about it and said she would have to talk to a manager. Ok... So she comes back and says they will honor the expired coupon but that I need to tell them to stop handing these coupons out. Seriously? Not going back..."}
{"text":"Ive come to Phillys quite a few times and tonight was the worst. Jay---- the manager, was here tonight and a total douche. I bet he doesn't even know i know his name.   At any rate, how can you as a business owner, tell a person on the phone...\" We close in 45 minutes or so...\" Not to mention, it being 9:48p at the time of this call. Okay soooooo, do you not want patronage and revenue at your business for the next 45 min? We went anyway just to make a point.  Sir, Jay... You should not storm like a bull towards my table. You have to be a work, make the best of it. I don't have to be at work, so i really feel you! Next time, ask me for my ID. Don't say, \"you guys don't have your IDs do ya?\" Of course we do you fool, we came to a bar. Bottom line, if you didn't want to be here until close of \"10:45\" tonight, you should have staffed appropriately."}
{"text":"THis place has great wings and its a cool hole in the wall type feel.  You can tell this place has its regulars as the servers knew people by name.  I will definitely be back for more wings and cocktails!!"}
