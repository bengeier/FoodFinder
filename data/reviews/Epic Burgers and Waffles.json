{"text":"I got the chicken and waffles...blah. Waffles are a tad to firm for me, it's not even fresh and chicken was too dry. Disappointed in my food selection at the CNE."}
{"text":"I ordered the Churro cheese burger. In the photo it came with a normal piece of cheddar cheese. I got a 1x1\" piece of white cheese. Not sure what kind of cheese but that was false advertising. This place was really set up for maximum profitability vs customer satisfaction. They don't have a store location anywhere else so this strategy makes a lot of sense."}

ok i came here from.the cne.  i was craving a burger.  now was it epic?  nope.  simple plain not bad but not great and most def not epic.  is it becsuse i didnt get the krispy creme as burger bread? or bacon?  or.... the other epic toppings or ingredients?  ill never know.  But i at least for 9-11$ expected serious burger meat.  like some sort of ground beef malenge of unique goodness.  it felt like some random supermarket patty.  my meal didnt even come with fries or a drink for that price.  definately made me feel like it was a \"maximizing the cne crowd\" rather than \"heres an epic meal\".  i should have went to harveys."}
{"text":"This food vendor has only been available in the Food Pavilion at the CNE, but it is well worth a visit. Last summer I shared their The Donut Burger and it was fantastic. Not only was it great because instead of a bun, it had TWO Krispy Kreme doughnuts, but the hamburger paddy itself was quite moist and tasty. I would consider going back to the CNE this year just to eat it again. Their other offerings include: The Original American Smash-Burger, Chicken and Waffles, and The Behemoth Burger (which is a hamburger slamed between grilled cheese sandwiches, much like the Vatican City on the secret menu at Burger's Priest)"}
{"text":"So glad the 5 of us decided to split a single Churro burger - the beef burger patty was well seasoned and juicy, the cheese was beautifully melted, but the churro bun was stale and borderline inedible. Imagine struggling to cut through cardboard with plastic knife then chewing until your TMJ are sore. One bite was just enough."}
