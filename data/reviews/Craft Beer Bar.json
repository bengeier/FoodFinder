{"text":"Was anxious to try this new place in Cuyahoga Falls. Great location and simple smart decor. Our waitress was extremely knowledgable providing beer and food Recommendations based on our tastes. Unfortunately, we were disappointed in the limited, pricey, and eclectic menu. While I love this type of new adventures and food, the bone marrow was oily and not prepared correctly. Their greens were delicious along with their scallops but the burger, which we heard so much about, was average. We each tried a flight of beer providing four different tastes of their crafts. Three out of four were flat. Concerned some mainstream food should be provided on their very limited menu. Considering 2 flights, one appetizer, one salad, a burger and scallops was $93. Ouch. Won't be running back."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! Excellent food, excellent selection a unique craft beer, great service. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I came here for a second time in Thurs, April 16 after having been there a few weeks prior with a friend. This time I brought my boyfriend who is a craft beer connoisseur. I was so excited once I saw they had poutine fries and ordered them immediately. They were very good until the about fourth to last bite. There was a bread tag in the dish. I don't know how I didn't see it before I put it in my mouth but it was a very odd feeling I was really confused. I do not blame it on the waitress or the cooks but it was unsettling and I decided to close out my check although the fries were taken off my bill. I did get two beers there though that night and they were very delicious. Not so sure I'll be back, I will be afraid to take a bite of anything."}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to rural Ohio from Brooklyn, I definitely have an interesting perspective on dining options in Cuyahoga Falls. Craft Beer Bar reminds me of home in some respects, which unfortunately work against this establishment for me. Let me explain...

Cuyahoga Falls has always been an awesome place to find simple satisfaction from local establishments within it and in the surrounding areas. I've grown accustom to coming into Ohio and sitting down to unbelievably affordable meals in terms of portions and overall goodness. Much like my general experience in the greater Akron area, the service at Craft was on point as to be expected- it seems that friendly service is just a part of the culture in these parts, and its greatly appreciated.

Craft Beer Bar also delivers in its namesake, they have a great selection of draft beers at craft beer prices. I opted for the Founders \"All day IPA\" on my two visits this past weekend, and was surprised to see one of my New England favorites tapped here. Once again, bartender and waitress' alike- customer service here is 10/10.

As for the food, it's delicious and well prepared- while the pricing seems to be much more NYC than Ohio. My first night in town I met with friends and had the Veal burger. While delicious, I was kind of surprised that the burger was not accompanied with any side fare. I get that its a gourmet style burger, but $13 for just a burger alone reminded me of what I don't like about a lot of trendy places throughout gentrified Brooklyn. Craft is beautifully decorated and built, but I have zero interest in paying extra for trendiness or atmosphere- which is really my only gripe. It's also obvious they are just getting things off the ground as a new establishment, since the waitress (while extremely courteous & friendly) lacked pertinent knowledge on specifics from the limited food menu. She unknowingly mislead one patron in my party to believe the \"Steak Tar Tar\" was a cooked meal as opposed to raw- albeit the patron was ignorant to outside clarification... but it is the servers duty to have distinct knowledge of what they're serving.

I will say, when you know what you're getting- Craft is a great place for some good beer and fancier appetizers than what you might find anywhere between Cuyahoga and Cleveland. While I wouldn't come to craft for an actual sit down dinner, it served as an awesome post dinner outing for some libations and a late night snack. The Poutine with its pork belly and egg over frittes is on point and priced right at $11 for the gourmet fries. Refreshing spin on what's available in the area, but this out of towner hopes to see Craft get just a little more \"home-town\" to it by the time I get a chance to visit again, and visit I will."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beers and the food is really good.  Service was good and bartenders were knowledgable on the beers they served. The only downside is seating is limited but had large family style tables for larger groups if you can get them."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The beer selection is good, and the service is usually good. Ordinarily my waitress is Lauren and she's bubbly, offers good suggestions, and is personable and prompt. Tonight I had a guy (Mike maybe?) and he was lackluster. He told me the kitchen was closed and it wasn't yet. It also it took him probably 10 minutes to come to our table after we were seated.  Management : get more Laurens and fewer Mikes."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say we did not share the good experience that other reviewers spoke of when visiting Craft Beer Bar. We had a party of six on Saturday night and managed to score a table inside. However, it is very loud and the acoustics make it difficult to have a civilized conversation. This extends to the order taking as well because our waitress literally did not get one thing right with our food order. My husband asked if the chicken wings were \"spicy\" and she replied that they were not, which is the way he likes them (mild, not spicy). How, then, did that turn into the hottest, most mouth burning wings ever and our waitress saying \"I thought you said to make them hot\"!?!?  So not what he said...  Also we asked for summer vegetable medley with the salmon burger instead of fries....and when the order came, we got fries. We also had to wait longer than we wanted for the waitress to ask if we wanted a second beer. Finally, another server came over and took our order for more drinks. Overall, it did not feel like we were that important to our assigned waitress. She did come back at the end of the meal to apologize for the chicken wing fiasco, but seemed to intentionally choose a time when my husband (who ordered the wings) was in the restroom.  Sadly my husband is not willing to give this place a second chance. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Hit this place over the weekend.  Made the trip down from Cleveland on word of mouth and it did not disappoint.  The tap selection is a good broad stroke of offerings.  I am a hop head so I would always like to see a wall of IPAs but alas the selection at Craft Beer Bar was substantial.

Food was good.  Had heard that is was a bit fancy with offerings but was happy to find great tasting and well prepared appetizers.  The meatloaf was the main course on a cold winter's day and it hit the spot.

The waitstaff was super nice without being overbearing.  

Would definitely make the drip south again or stop in while traveling through on business.  Nice addition to a town I would otherwise not go to."}
{"text":"Six different dinners and all six were outstanding.  The veggie melt was delicious  according to Charla.  Linda described the Hawaiian chicken flatbread as the best she has ever had.  The spinach salad with chicken was very tasty according to Dave.  Jonathan says the craft burger was delightfully tangy.  Kylie said the chicken wrap was \"very good\", but went on to say, the fries were better.  I had the Philly steak and it was incredibly yummy!  Our waitress, Lauren, was the best waitress ever! She brought us beer!  We will all be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday after the golf tournament. The beer selection was great. The bar setup is fantastic. It is a great place to watch the game. The food was good, plentiful, and priced right. We had some snafus with the order but the bartender was top notch. I can't remember her name but any small issues she proactively took care of. 5 stars for the service she provided. Thank you. Recommend"}
{"text":"Craft Beer Bar is a nice little place. The beer selection is decent, and the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. The food is a bit over-priced ($8 for a soup seems especially egregious), but the dishes I've had have been tasty. Some of the beer is also a little optimistically priced, but they do a $5 happy hour on weekdays. Good location, plenty of parking, and the outdoor seating gives you a nice view of the park."}
{"text":"Hit this place up for dinner and beers when staying at the Sheraton Suites right across the street. Live in Houston and was in town for business. Highly recommend if you want a nice bar with good drinks and bar food at very reasonable prices. Salads were huge and a bargain for what you get. The cute bartender gal pushes the review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"We were surprised to find that only perhaps 20 beers were on tap, and of those about 6 were Bell's.  Maybe one was local.  On a Friday evening at 7 pm, several beers were already not available.  The food was adequate, but nothing exciting.  Service at the bar was inattentive at best.  Bottom line, there are many places in the area with better craft beer selections, friendlier service and similar food."}
{"text":"Great craft beer! Local crowd pleaser. Fun place with great people! I would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Hands down-best new hidden gem!
Located across the street from the Sheraton hotel in Cuyahoga Fall. This restaurant has a savory and delectable menu. They have an amazing selection of beer from local brewers. The atmosphere was perfect for date night with my hubby-a nice restaurant and a wide variety of beer...what more could we ask for?! The service was the best we have had in a long time! The entire staff was incredible! I had the elk chops-perfectly cooked and seasoned. Hubby had the buffalo burger-also perfectly cooked (medium-rare). We would highly recommend both!!! Our server really knew her stuff and was so helpful recommending things and giving great descriptions of the food and all of the different beer! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a FABULOUS place!!!! Great taps and deliciously \"crafty\" food selections.  Service was excellent (thank you Shawn for the rim job on my Christmas Ale). Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Craft Beer Bar is a great addition to Cuyahoga Falls. It's right across from the Sheraton and The Office. 
My husband and I went there a week after they opened. The beer selection was excellent. All the staff was very knowledgeable about the different types of beers, tastes, etc. We met with one of the owners and she was a delight. 
We didn't order anything to eat but the menu seemed great.
This place has an awesome atmosphere and I think once summer hits, this place will be very popular!"}
{"text":"Went for some good craft beer and I was very pleased with the selection of the beer.  The bar tenders had a lot of knowledge about what was on tap!
I did not try the food, but from what I saw it all looked great!
Love the ambiance and all the choices on tap, will be back!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool bar ! I have been there twice and it's beautiful and inviting. Make a reservation on the weekend."}
{"text":"We're in the area about 3 times a year, and have struggled to find a good craft beer place. Craft has a great beer selection, a passionate owner, friendly staff that knows their beer, and is only about 1000 ft from the front door of the Sheraton. 

Beer isn't the only reason to hit up the bar though. Craft is a solid gastropub with a good menu. We split the muscles, the spinach salad w/ goat cheese and baby beats, and the meatball sub. Everything was delicious. We were particularly surprised by the meatball - the bread was soft and didn't get soggy - the meatballs and marinara were great.

Our experience at craft was great from start to finish and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! I was staying at the sheraton and front desk said \"craft beer opened 2 days ago\".  That's all I had to hear, and I'm glad I made the stop. Food is modern flare yet simply wonderful flavors.   Beer selection of 20+ taps will not disappoint.  Staff was amazing to say the least!  

If you are anywhere near here, this is a musts!"}
{"text":"Stepped up their game big-time!
They really care about customers experience.
Good beers & food."}
{"text":"Welcome addition to Cuyahoga Falls. Craft is a place that focuses on only a few menu items, but does them extremely well. My wife and I have eaten here twice since opening. The carbonara and risotto were both excellent, and the dessert was completely innovative (popcorn custard, way better than it sounds!). Regarding the drinks, I am a beer fan and am overjoyed by the concept! Their 30 taps are really more like 40, Craft only orders small quantities of beer from breweries so the handles are rarely the same from one day to the next. I can always find a beer I have never tried before (great for you Untappd users out there). My wife is not a beer fan but was amazed by the quality of wine Craft offered; there were only two or three selections but all were hidden gems.

All in all, this place fills a void that existed in the area, while doing so with a great atmosphere, ingenious concept and above all, great food!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends to explore the beer selection and utilizing a decent Groupon deal for dinner.

Food [B-] The menu items sound very promising at first, with the right collection of ingredients paired harmoniously. The execution, however, was greatly wanting. Our group tried the meatloaf, pulled pork mac & cheese, fish & chips, and a few of the appetizers to start. Craft does run an acceptable Happy Hour set of food and drinks, of which the poutine was the star. Drenched in gravy, topped with an egg, pulled pork and cheese curds, I definitely enjoyed the flavor mix. Fries were hot, crisp, and well seasoned. The soft pretzels also tasted fresh, warm and comforting like a soft pillow with a side of cheesy sauce ( which wasn't entirely pleasant due to an odd texture). On top of that, the beers here come from a variety of places and cover the gamut at a reasonable price. The entrees, however, is where Craft loses the most points. The fish & chips was incredibly salty. I'm a huge fan of Old Bay, having grown up with it, but these fries had a quadruple dose of Old Bay plus regular salt. In short, the fries were only partially edible. The fish was uninspiring, lacking the tender flakiness you'd expect to find from fried cod. The pulled pork mac & cheese was bland, runny, and the pasta missed out on a firm bite. The meatloaf was acceptable, complemented well with the mashed potatoes. For the food alone, I would drop this grade to a C+ at best, but the decent starters and great beer bring up the overall food/drink experience to a B- 

Service [B+] Waitstaff were attentive, and brought out food and rinks as requested. A little bit pushy with the beer refills/purchases, but that's to be expected at this kind of institution. It's a bar, first and foremost after all.

Ambiance [B+] Seating is very limited, so I recommend making reservations beforehand. It's not your conventional restaurant setup, i.e. tables with cloths and seats low to the floor. Even when you're not sitting at the actual bar, you still feel like you're part of a larger bar biome as a whole, which is actually cool. Everyone seemed to be having a great, but not overtly drunk time. Street parking is also limited, but there's a lot across the establishment that you can access via the Sheraton entrance.

All in all, I would give this place 3.5 stars, uplifted by the excellent amount of beers available and some good poutine in the Falls. Check it out for the Happy Hour deals at the very least."}
{"text":"A nice place to stop for a beer or diner. They know their selection of beer. The food is fantastic. The more this area grows the more magic comes in the form of local businesses . This one has only been here a year and has proven that it will be around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Great craft beers, but the prices were a little high even for craft beers, $17 for two pints. I like the location and look of the bar, but I agree with some other reviews in that the menu needs to have a few additional items that can appeal to the masses. Also, the bar itself is a little small. I may be back in a few months to give it a second shot as I do enjoy a nice craft beer and the type of atmosphere they're trying to display."}
{"text":"I understand that the Craft Beer Bar is new, and I'm guessing I'm not smart enough to get all the hip jokes, but this place was very disappointing. The food wasn't nearly worth the price, and the beer menu was mediocre. Perhaps most disappointing was the lack of attention from the owners. We love down the street, we love The Office and eat there regularly, and we were looking forward to this place opening based on articles in the paper, supporting local biz and all that. I guess that we are not the demographic, because the owner scowled at us when we walked in. She also scowled on the way out, so consistency is good.

We will continue to make The Office our go-to place, and we'll drink beer with the other uncool at Hunt's..."}
{"text":"I loved it here, but I was super disappointed when I got there because the menu looked so good. But I had just eaten dinner at another restaurant, so I was too full to order. I went with some friends for drinks after dinner, and the place was great. I really liked the atmosphere. I was surprised the beer list wasn't bigger since the name is \"Craft Beer Bar,\" but I am not much of a beer person anyway, so I just stuck to the cocktail menu. I ended up getting 2 of their seasonal mixed drinks, which were both delicious, and high in alcohol content (thumbs up). I can't wait to go back and try the food menu since it looked so good!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the staff!!! I haven't ate food from there yet but hopefully soon. They have a great selection of craft beer and the staff has great knowledge of the choices. Great addition to the falls."}
{"text":"I have to admit I initially only came here because I had bought a Groupon. I was not disappointed! 

The restaurant is much smaller than it looks from the outside but it is absolutely beautiful on the inside! Everything from the look of the walls to the light fixtures- the designers got it right! The restaurant is more of bar feel than an actual restaurant but I think this is exactly the type of place Cuyahoga Falls needs! They need more places that people can hangout at.

I took my dad as my date and we ordered the Barbacoa Tacos and the Beef Brisket sandwich. Both were absolutely fabulous! My dad ate every last bite of his tacos and rice- the plate was clean! The chips that are served with the sandwiches are crisp and delicious as well. 

The ironic part of the meal was that I ordered the Cleveland Palesner for the first time here and I live in Cleveland! Ha!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Food was delicious. Service at the bar was slow, but  sometimes that's to be expected at the bar on Saturday at dinner. Burgers and brisket mac and cheese were delightful! Solid beer selection. with a name like craft beer bar you might hope for a more eclectic selection, but, no doubt, you'll still find something to please your palette. Looking forward to whiskey!"}
{"text":"Usually I love Craft. Great location, good beer. But the service needs to be amped up or trained a bit more. The last time we were there, my wife and I got menus, asked a few questions about the food, and made it pretty clear we were there to eat. We were sitting at the bar. When we were ready to order, the bartenders were behind the bar near the POS system munching on food. I've never seen a nice restaurant allow their service staff to eat in front of customers while there were people waiting to be served. We had to flag down the bartender to finally place our order and he was seemingly put out by us ordering food. Odd. I figured he'd like a nice tip from people ordering two entrees and multiple drinks. Regarding the food, the Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese was great. Good flavors, rich, and quite delicious. The Beef and Bacon Meatloaf? Horrible. Dry, overcooked, seriously lacking in the bacon department and bland. I will not order that again. Overall, I enjoy Craft, but that poor service needs to be fixed if I'm going to keep going."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the visit to Craft Beer Bar.  Was excited to check the place out due to the positive reviews.  It was crowded at first and we waited about 10 mins for a seat.  Not a big deal.  We then waited...and waited...and waited for our server to return...which he did not.  By this time most of the tables were empty.  Fifteen minutes later, no one returns to the table.  The young man that had seated us and said he would be \"right back\" was washing dishes and looking at me as my guest and I put on our coats to leave.  Never said a word.......very bad look Craft Bar.  I will be sure to NOT recommended you to the numerous clients that my company entertains."}
{"text":"We had a larger party of 10 and we could barely be sat all together...this is a small scale establishment. I don't drink beer but they had a few ciders, the peach cider was delicious. A friend had the cherry cider and it was good as well.  We had the crab cakes as an appetizer and they were the best part of our meals....highly recommend them. I had a burger which was cooked perfectly but lacked seasoning. My husband had the tacos and they were good, but nothing impressive. 

The decor is aesthetically pleasing and inspiring.  Note the pics of the bathroom sink."}
{"text":"Craft Beer Bar is a good place to go for conversation. There's a nice outdoor patio with a lot of seating. Finally an outdoor patio with good seating!!!! A lot of the IPAs were crossed off the menu which was a bummer. Everything else was beer you could find at Market District. If you're a religious Bud Light drinker you won't like the beer selection. I wouldn't suggest bringing a large party. If the place is packed you won't have much room to wiggle around. Nice little bar, but the beer menu was way to out there for me. I'd like to come back and try the food!"}
{"text":"Really nice place that oddly enough, is a craft beer bar. So don't come here looking for something other than a great place to grab some hard-to-find brews and pretty good food. 

The atmosphere is uber comfortable and the waitstaff was outstanding i.e., genuinely pleasant. The place was fairly full on a Tuesday night at 730 so that speaks volumes about its overall quality and popularity. 

We had the soft pretzels (gigantic serving, more like the size of a couple cucumbers cut in half) and served with beer cheese, delicious. And the presentation was nice and artisanal.

The menu looked wonderful but we were having dinner at the Sheraton across the street, so we limited our food to the soft pretzels (what's better with a couple craft beers anyway...). 
I'm looking forward to visiting Cuyahoga Falls and CBB again, as this place contributed mightily to a good day."}
{"text":"its ok.  Maybe I am used to more.  Decent Beer options but not a lot if your looking for something special.  If you want a mixed drink keep it simple and your ok.  My wife wanted a dirty martini with blue cheese olives...not an option.  She wanted a summer shandy...not an option.  Food menu is limited also. 
I would say its a place to go have great conversation and a few drinks.  Waiter was very good, place was clean."}
{"text":"This place is such a catch if you are looking for a good beer and have good taste in beer. They truly are a craft beer bar so get ready you've crafty with your choice! I sat down and Katrina greeted me immediately. She asked about my beer of choice. I told her I liked IPAs and she gave me a selection of samples to try while giving me a run down of the flavors of each beer. Can you ask for much more?! Knowledgeable bartenders, a great selection of beers and an ice cold brewski! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We stopped in this evening with a party of 20 people. We heard the beer was good and wanted to support a local business. We were informed by the hostess that unless you could find a seat at the bar you could not be served. She proceeded to tell us they were to busy. The bartenders were standing behind the bar talking to each other. Good luck. It's hard to stay in business when you turn business away."}
{"text":"Great experience. Many many choices of draft beers with great descriptions so you know what you are getting. Crowded at check in, someone does take a drink order though, which is fantastic!  The food was scrumptious!  We had the spinach salad and veggie melt. Our server, Liz, was very good. Thank you Craft for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Good, not great, beer selection, nice place. All the beers on tap this evening you could easily run down in the the NEO are. So, slightly disappointed. With a name like CRAFT BEER BAR, give me reason to come here....

The kicker is the water. Tastes like well water. We all know we need to rinse our palates as we transition from beer to beer and the water here is not up to par. Brutality..."}
{"text":"Came across this place while traveling for work. I was looking for a brewery to visit in the area but apparently they are all closed on Monday/Tuesday nights? Definitely a great selection of craft beers which ranges from local craft breweries in Ohio to all over the US. The service was fine and friendly but did not exceed expectations. Very nice atmosphere to grab a beer and bite to eat when on the road. I got the salmon burger and a side salad; it's was okay. The burger was a tad dry but I was too hungry to complain. All in all I thought this place was average, but that's sort of what I expected."}
{"text":"I'm going to give Craft a 4 star but I hope someday I can put that up to a 5. 

Let me start my saying they have been open not even 1 week at our visit. With that in mind, I know there will probably be improvement & kinks worked out. 

I was very surprised by the size when we walked in. I suppose I just had pictured something larger. The bar looks to seat about 25 roughly. There was 6 four tops on one side, a handful of 2 tops and 1 larger party table. This def. does not seem like a place for groups- it was very crowded on one side, In fact, it was crowded everywhere. 

Service is where I'm sure kinks will be worked out. Waitress was so friendly & chatty- loved her! Overall I'd say 3/5 on service though. She took our drink order & app which took a good 15+minutes to receive. Dropped it off & left. Never asked about food. We flagged her down & put in our dinner order as we'd already been there nearing 30 minutes. App came, dropped that off as well off & left. (Was the cheese & meat). No clue at all what we were eating. Dinner order was very slow to arrive. 40+ for risotto & carbonara. Water asked off numerous times to waitress & presumably the owner, received at the end of our entree. We also had both waitress/owner stop by numerous times &  never took finished plates which was I found a bit odd. Again, they are new, there will be kinks. 

Food & drinks: 
My husband is a beer snob. Often annoying because he knows SO much & can be judge mental on selection. He wasn't impressed(but of course found plenty to drink). I think this just comes from a lot of travel on our part to some really amazing beer cities. I had a sprite (would love beer but I'm due in 1 month). I told the  waitress the syrup was out and she brought me another,still out. We have numerous conversations about it and she even told me that were having issues with it all week. When the check came I was surprised to see I was still charged for a soda that wasn't a soda.

Ok, so the food. I hate to do this but it's just not my thing. Hated the cheese board. It's all pates, the bread was dry & I think carrots? Just wasn't what I expected. Maybe 1 or 2 pates but not everything. I really think the selection could have been better variety. Risotto was really good and something I'd come back for. Carbonara was decent but nothing to blow you away. I included a picture of their menu which is pretty short. I guess there is just nothing that makes me want to come back to try more. (And that's hard because I love food!!). 

I think long term, this place will be great. It's got a cool vibe & offers something a bit different for the area. I think we'll wait a couple months to try again though and maybe then it'll WOW us a bit more. In the meantime, go check it out because I do think it's a great addition to the falls."}
{"text":"Love this place. I tend to stop by on Saturday afternoons, have a couple drafts, maybe some grub, and pass the time with Sean the bartender (great guy). The beer selection is always changing, and is always excellent. You can tell that the management and staff here understand that craft beers are pivotal to their brand, and that it behooves them to take that seriously. Sean has forgotten more about beer than I'll ever know, and I'm no noob on the subject. I've had just a couple items off the food menu, but no disappointments there either; the kitchen staff, near as I can tell, are just as much on their game as the brew-staff. Lasy but not least, atmosphere and decor-wise, Craft is amazing. It's comfortable, relaxed, yet very hip. Warm and inviting. Even the bathrooms are cool. I'm a fan, as you can tell. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cute little place inside and out. It sits across the street from a park that is on the river.  The inside is covered with wood and brick and those trendy Edison bulbs for light at each table. The beer list was average but the food menu had it right.  Having an intense fondness of Mac n' cheese, I got the Pulled Pork Mac (three cheese gemelli pasta topped with slow roasted bbq pork, jalapenos and diced tomatoes). Not only did it come out beautiful it tasted that way as well.  Luckily it was so big I got to take some home and eat it for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Craft Beer Bar! First off, it's definitely not a dancing bar or anything like that and brings in an older crowd (and I guess, older to me is like thirty year olds+). It's dimly light with a great atmosphere! There are local brewery signs on the wall and really cute industrial light bulbs. There are some tables but it's not awesome for larger groups. There's also a large bar running along the length of it. It's not huge but they have a little patio outside too for when it's warmer out. 

I wish I could speak more about beers, but I don't like beer. However, the three people I was with said that they had an awesome selection of tons of beers on tap and that they were moderately priced.
They also had a few mixed drinks and a wine list for non-beer drinker like myself and I had a green-tea whiskey drink that I enjoyed and was well made and averagely priced as well ($8). 

I got a burger and French fries and was super happy with what I got for like $12! I honestly LOVED their garlic Parmesan French fries. They seemed like they were Freshly cut and just are really addicting. 

In addition, the bartenders were attentive and nice. The place has a really chill vibe and is a great place to grab a drink! Not sure how happy hour is or anything, we went around 9pm on a Saturday and it was pretty packed."}
{"text":"Cory D is the best servicer in town. It just adds to the deliciousness of the food and drink, especially on the refreshing and relaxing patio."}
{"text":"Huge beer section!!! I recommend the poutine, it was a huge order of fries and gravy with little cheese curds through and a giant poached egg on top. It will take 3 people to eat it. The staff was helpful in picking which beers to get. Amazing little place I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good selection and prompt seating. Nice patio for the summer months but looks pretty small. Food was good as was the service."}
{"text":"Nice and casual seated quickly despite large crowd.  Wide selection of beer.  Food was well prepared and a good variety for a tavern.  Service was good and definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"This place is very cute. I've been here several times and I love the owners. They are very engaging and friendly. The food menu has significantly improved since their opening and their beer list is ever changing with an excellent variety. The bathroom sink is awesome (see pic)!  They have an outdoor patio and is located next to the scenic Cuyahoga River. Give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"The food is so great here! Definitely get the Poutine, it's to die for! We've only been there on Fridays around 5 pm and they're usually pretty slow so it's not crowded and plenty of seats open. Great beer selection (although my husband didn't see any craft Stouts on the menu on 7/22, so he was a little disappointed).

We've only visited while using a Groupon but we'll definitely be back, the menu is pretty unique, and it seems they change it every once in awhile, love it!"}
{"text":"Feels like the are trying to be a burntwood tavern of the office. Food is overpriced for the portion given. I think they had maybe 12-16 drafts. Hardly any local breweries on them. They were out of quiet a few taps. Two tvs in the whole place. No liquor on Sunday's. But the bar stools are very comfortable."}
{"text":"We came here and - after reading some of the reviews - expected a step above \"sports bar food\".  Okay, so we came here on a Sunday... the barmaid was watching international Soccer instead of the Cavs, the waiter informed us that there is \"no Sunday liquor license; only beer\", and the atmosphere was uncomfortable at best.  We were not greeted at the door - there is no foyer.  We simply toppled into the plaza-like entry to the vacant stares of the patrons and staff.  The waitstaff seemed to be \"going through the motions\" - sadly disappointing.  

We were excited to try to beers on tap, however the menu wasn't up to date... three of our choices were \"sold out\" before I could settle on my fourth choice - Great Lakes Chillwave - now being served EVERYWHERE... I was disappointed to say the least.  Wine??? There are 2 reds and maybe as many whites... don't bother to try and impress a date.

We tried the Pouttine because I had never had it.  It was a rich, satisfying warm mound of fresh cut fries, light beige gravy, cheese curds, and a beautiful poached egg.  Really decadent!  The meatball sandwich and bacon meatloaf with cheddar mashed was your typical barfare.

We won't be back.  When your food is merely acceptable and your wine list is non-existent you need to rely on your waitstaff's personality.  Good luck here..."}
{"text":"Yummo. A really good sandwich and the homemade fries were...yes...homemade. Sweet waitress. And healthy adult beverages. If I lived here and become a regular!!!"}
{"text":"What a great time! The food was awesome and the beer selection for drafts was outstanding ! All types for all! There was an issue with one of the food items and corrected it asap, very nice staff!  

Love the burger. So tasty! And the fries are awesome! I also had the half portion meat and cheese plate! I loved it! 

We had beer flights so we got to try a lot of different beers. A lot come from Ohio too! 

What a great time, we did arrive at 430PM and had no problem getting a table for 6. The place got packed in a few hours so get there early if you can

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that has just about everything a craft beer geek with a gastrophilic bent could ask for - solid, well-planned craft beer list and a menu filled with upscale renditions of American comfort food. Throw in a comfy little space that makes you want to linger and it's easy to see the attraction. And while they've made a few changes since opening back in September, our experience has shown them to be for the better.

The Four Walls:
I really dig the vibe here. The lighting isn't too bright, the music isn't too loud and the chairs at the high tops are like a little vacation for your ass. Even the cliche design elements - exposed brick, retro-style incandescent lights, chalkboard beer menu - work here in just the right amounts. The square footage isn't that large so I can imagine it gets mighty crowded during the weekends.

The Schtick:
The name pretty much says it all - Craft Beer Bar - with one exception. It's not just a bar. Sure, the beer list at Craft Beer Bar reads like a greatest hits collection with some amazing selections from both local and national craft breweries (Bell's, Destihl, Lagunitas, Jackie O's, Lagerheads, Madcap), but it's not all about the suds here. The menu is just the right length and it's loaded with hearty, upscale bar fare and stick-to-your-ribs entrees.

The Grub:
As I mentioned before, the menu isn't that large, but what they do have appears to have been carefully curated and, as we were to find out, well-executed. Beer cheese soup, mussels, poutine and salads share the bill with barbacoa tacos, pasta bolognese and beef and bacon meatloaf.

We started with the Greens salad ($8), a delicious combination of mixed greens, cranberries, toasted almonds, and bacon smoked cheddar. The black French dressing was a unique take and the smokiness of the cheese really took this simple salad over the top.

Because we're suckers for bowls of melted cheese, we couldn't resist the warm bacon queso dip ($5). A perfect portion of melty, gooey bacon-y cheese surrounded by house-made tortilla chips. 

My wife opted for the barbacoa tacos ($16) and I the meatloaf ($14). The trio of tacos, served on a growler-shaped cutting board, were filled with perfectly cooked, well-seasoned pork topped with a cooling lime crema, pico de gallo and shredded cheese. We finished these bad boys in no time. 

Sure, the tacos were good, but the meatloaf, damn. When it comes to loaves of carnal goodness these guys do it right. This meatloaf was awesome. A thick slab of perfectly seasoned meat sat atop a slice of crunchy, chewy sourdough bread, atop a layer of cheddar mashed potatoes and covered in a delicious gravy and crunchy fried onions. I was pretty hungry and this one filled the hole easily. If you've been away from meatloaf for awhile, welcome it back into your life with this one.

The Service:
Overall, we felt that the service we received was pretty good. We were seated immediately, our orders were taken quickly and filled just as fast, but there was a bit of a lull in the middle that had us twiddling our thumbs over empty beer glasses longer than we wanted. Had they been busier I'd probably have overlooked this minor misstep, but they weren't and I didn't. Our server did keep our waters full which I'm a bit of a stickler about, so that was good.

The Whole Package:
The Craft Beer Bar is one of those places, if they happened to be closer than a 45 min drive from home, we'd probably add into our regular rotation. The atmosphere is delightful, the service friendly and attentive (mostly), the beer list makes the Certified Cicerone in me all giddy, and the food is filling, classy and delicious. If you haven't been, even if you do live out of the Cuyahoga Falls/Akron area, you should give them a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! The Craft beer list is consistently rotating and always has something for everybody. From a pilsner to a stout and everything in between and plenty of local beers to boot, you will not be disappointed! Not sure what to try? The wait staff is always willing to listen and offer a suggestion. Mike is especially knowledgeable and will not steer you wrong. 
The food is fantastic! We started with the pretzel appetizer with a delightful cream cheese spread. I'm not a fan of mustard so did not try it. I had the chicken sandwich for dinner and it was super tasty. My husband had the meatloaf and he was in heaven. 
If you have not tried Craft Beer Bar and you are a craft beer fan you must check this place out. You will not be disappointed. From the food to the beer to the interior deco to the comfy patio, this place is second to none! And to think all this can be found on Front Street in Cuyahoga Falls! We are so fortunate!"}
{"text":"What an awesome find. My friend I were looking for somewhere new to eat and Yelped this place. The food was delicious. They had a happy hour which was great. Outdoor seating was nice and not too loud. Our server was so cute and attentive. He checked in on us the right amount of times and seemed as happy as us to be there. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ribeye sandwich was very good. Craft burger was okay, but fries were under seasoned. Was not pleased to hear they couldn't cook burgers medium rare, though they did make the effort and it was cooked properly. Server gave the kitchen a note, but said no at first. Not used to hearing no when I ask for my food to be cooked the way I most enjoy it. Server seemed a bit abrupt, but was attentive."}
{"text":"Work has me in town for a couple days. After reading the mixed review I decided to give it  try. The staff behind the bar know their beer and spent a good bit of time assisting patrons in the bar with their selections. I enjoyed a couple of craft beers and the poutine. The food, conversation, and most importantly the beer were all top notch. Thanks for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"My favorite beer bar in Ohio. Probably anywhere.  

Great selection of craft beers. Kudos to ownership for bringing in good breweries for tap takers. Top notch breweries like Great Lakes Brewing Company, Founders, Platform and Weyerbacher have been featured. 

Staff has been uniformly friendly and helpful. The food is well prepared and there's s good selection to please your crowd. The flatbreads are excellent. 

I fell lucky to have this bar in our area. The opportunity to sample the best in drafts is a luxury."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this place. I went with a few friends this past week and really enjoyed their beer selection along with their food. The poutine was excellent. Even better than poutine I've had in Canada! Their salad and BLT sandwich was very tasty as well. Everyone in their group enjoyed their meals. I will definitely return to this place. This is a place to hang out and eat some good food and have great beer. Their wine selection was alright and they do have a full bar but not a mixed drink menu. I wouldn't suggest this as a place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Yes the craft beers and the atmosphere are terrific.  But come for the food, which is first rate.  My wife adores the pulled pork Mac n cheese.  I love the barbacoa tacos and the savory grilled chicken sandwich.  Don't miss this experience."}
{"text":"Great place. Really cool looking on the inside, great attention to detail, especially in the bathrooms weirdly enough. Interesting beer selection and good food. It's a little pricey, but worth it. The bow tie pasta and pretzels were excellent."}
{"text":"A Cleveland-quality bar in little ol' Cuyahoga Falls. If you have one evening in the Akron area, this is the place to go. 

This place means business. Always a great, unique rotation of both local and hard-to-find brews here, and the bartenders are always spot-on for recommendations. The ever-changing beer menu they've got does an amazing job of offering a selection of many different kinds of beer, ciders, etc.., so there is really something for everyone here. And if they don't have it, they're so good about taking recommendations! 

Now, it wouldn't be a visit to Craft without an order of their poutine. Seriously. Get the poutine. Traditionally, they've been serving it with some variation of either bacon or pork belly with their homemade, slow-cooked gravy and mozzarella curds, but lately they've been testing a beef brisket/cheddar version, and holy wow. The brisket version's not on the menu, but ask if they've still got it on special. You wont be disappointed. Both the on-menu and special poutine are killer. 

I recently met some of the owners of the establishment, and they're just the most wonderful people as well. A great bar, with great food, service, and management! I can't think of a better place to call my go-to bar!"}
{"text":"Visiting on business.  I went in for the name and was pleased and disappointed at the same time.  

It's just another new bar.  Yes, they have craft beer on tap.  So does everybody these days. If they would sell bottles as well it would set them apart and be an amazing new CRAFT beer joint.  But it's just another bar

The establishment is very nice, clean modern.

The food was just ok.  I had the brisket.  Which came with a Cajun French fry on the sandwich.  They were lost and actually made the sandwich mushy.  You couldn't taste the citrus sauce with over mayo'd slaw also on the sandwich.  The fries and chips are to many starches as well food wise.  (Maybe someone need to talk to the chef)

This is a scenario of less is more.  No fries, no slaw and my plate would have been great.  

The home made chips they serve are amazing! If there were more tvs (which is not what they are going for) I would go back for the chips."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great food. Must get the pretzel!  Staff is super nice. Seating is limited but service is fast."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food. Poutine and Hawaiian flatbread were out of this world. Putting out some pretty bomb food for a small local bar. Large craft beer selection as well as some wines and full bar. First time and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ok. There was a nice atmosphere and the beer selection was pretty good, but nothing that I don't think you couldn't just run to Market District and buy yourself. They were out of a couple of beers that some people in our party ordered, which was a bummer. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly, which is why I'm rating three stars instead of just two. 

We ordered food, which seemed exceptionally overpriced when it appeared at our table. The charcuterie board ($15 for a \"full board\") basically consisted of salami slices you'd use to make your kid's sandwich with and some chunks of cheese (of which I will say the Gouda was delicious). The fajitas we ordered were just ok, but the guacamole that came with them was awful and tasted nothing like it was homemade. Bottom line: we probably won't go back for food, but may stop in for a beer sometime."}
{"text":"The place was understaffed. Food was ok . They have a good variety of craft beer . Our waitress did not come back around until about :0
Min. A large group of people came in, over took the bar and our waitress served them prior to bringing us our drinks. My husband had to go up and pick up
His drinks since the other waiter wasn't attending our area ."}
{"text":"Beers were cool. Pretzels were good, dip so HOWEVER, after I left (and handed a cash tip to a bartender). The other guy, took my credit card and LOOKED ME UP ON FACEBOOK AND TRIED TO 'SCOLD' me for not leaving him a tip!!   I HAVE NEVER BEEN SP CREEPED OUT IN MY LIFE.  I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE!  

It's 3 days later and the owner has contacted me that she has handled the situation.  That individual is no longer with them.  Other than that incident, I would confidently say this is a nice bar.  The owner seemed to really care about my well being."}
{"text":"This was absolutely a solid 4 stars for me. I think it's a great addition to area and it's really what people are looking for these days. 

So we started with the poutine, which I actually have never had. It was great. I would absolutely get it again. Then I tried the chopped salad? With some sort of dressing that tasted like green goddess but on crack. It was delicious. For dinner I had the bolognese, and this was a little disappointing. The noodles were homemade which you have to give them credit for bc you don't see it very often but the sauce was too tomatoey and had big chunks of pork. 

The beer selection here is great, my husband and brother seemed to love it. Even if I was a beer drinking I wouldn't be now since I am pregnant. If you are a wine drinker, I wouldn't bother they had a red and a white wine and that was it. 

This place was...cozy. It's small and has more spots at the bar than anything. I will absolutely be back to try some other dishes but getting the poutine as an app will be a staple when I come here."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to see a place like this in Cuyahoga Falls! Craft is an upscale, well, beer bar (obviously) - no Miller Lite or Yuengling here. Their drafts change regularly, & the bartender will make recommendations based on what you already know you like. It's a nice space - a little bit small? - & has a sort of cozy, posh-dive feel to it - well lit but not TOO well lit, spacious bar, a few high-top tables & some booths tucked away for quieter conversation.

Also a plus: Everyone who works here seems to be really friendly & helpful. They were accommodating of our very large party one night, & the bartender didn't get mad at us when our friend got sick in the bathroom past closing time. 

It's the food that I'm not so sure about yet. Their menu attempts to be as upscale as their beer offerings, though frankly I feel it's falling a little bit short so far. I'm willing to pay extra for something really good, but right now, Craft doesn't feel like it's quite there... & so it doesn't quite feel worth the price, at least food-wise. 

Their poutine, for example, has rave reviews but is wildly inconsistent when you order it - sometimes made with bacon, sometimes not; sometimes made with Brussels sprouts, sometimes not; usually not enough cheese, etc. It's pretty tasty regardless, but you never know what you're going to get; I'd like to see some streamlining so that you know what to expect when you order it. Their meatball sandwich is good, but it's light on meatballs & heavy on white bread, not quite worth the pricetag; friends have made similar comments about other menu items.

I'm also not thrilled that when I told the bartender I like one-note lagers, he gave me a sample of a dark beer. Dude, know your audience. I know this is an upscale craft beer bar, but if someone tells you she usually drinks Yuengling, don't give her a sample of something closer to Guinness. 

Bottom line is that I like Craft, am excited about its existence, & will continue to come back. But I'd like to see them step it up a bit & even out so that I can like it even more than I already do."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a beer and were very impressed with the bartender.  Ben was knowledgeable and helpful in choosing two delicious beers for us.  We didn't order any food,  but what we saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing!"}
{"text":"I was here with some friends and luckily we were able to get three seats at the bar upon walking in. It was a very small place so you can imagine a Saturday night.  Had we not lucked out we would have waited for a long time. There were people still waiting when we left that were there before us. The decor was modern and lent well to the atmosphere.  That's where things stop being memorable for the most part.

The bartender wasn't very knowledgable about the beers they had which really surprised me since the name of the place is Craft Beer Bar. He did let us try a few samples before making a selection which was nice.  The selection wasn't anything special. You could get most of these craft beers around the corner at Giant Eagle in their craft section. I was hoping there would be something more rare.

I ordered the Poutine and I will say this was very good and the portion was big enough for all three of us to share. It is also why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2. My Beef Brisket was very bland and dry. Not even the jalapeño slaw could save it. The homemade chips were standard but over cooked. I had to ask for a dipping sauce to eat them because they had no flavor.  

The pricing seemed pretty high in my opinion. $13 for the sandwich, $11 for Poutine and $7 for beer.  It just wasn't worth what I got. I've had better for less.  It is a trendy place but I don't think the hype will last long and people will branch out elsewhere. If you do end up here, pick an off hour so you aren't waiting.  I don't suggest a group larger than 4 here.  Try to sit at the bar to cut down on the wait. And definitely try the Poutine!"}
{"text":"Great place to just sit and relax with fantastic choices of unusual beers and delicious appetizers. The staff was pleasant and knowledgeable of whatever we inquired about and helped us make choices we were satisfied with. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent beer selection. Patio is nice in the summer. Food is a little pricy and the service isn't the best but the food is great"}
{"text":"We just visited this place for the first time last night. From start to finish, it was a great experience. We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in the door. Service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. The beer list was extensive and we loved the options! The food was great too. We had an appetizer of bacon chorizo queso dip which was a nice shareable plate for the two of us to get 
 started. The dip had great flavor and was what I expected from the menu's description. 
I had braised pork tacos and rice. The meat was wonderful and tender. I personally would have liked a little more spice or flavor. It went well with the chunky pineapple salsa. My boyfriend got the craft burger and fries. The fries were nice and crispy, which makes me think we need the poutine next time because I'd imagine poutine is done well with these fries! I had a bit of the burger which was thick and juicy, and had a wonderful flavor that I was not expecting! The red onion jam and bleu cheese on the burger really made it! It was an explosive punch as I hit into it that went perfectly with this perfectly cooked burger. It made me with I ordered it! Our only critique was that the bun of the burger was a thin and unfortunately noticeable cheap bun. It tasted like a 99 cent value pack bun. For such an amazing burger with such amazing flavor we expected a bun of that quality too. I could see a nice brioche bun working well with this. I'd say the burger was A quality, but with a quality bun it would really amp it up to a A +.  This is nothing for us to be upset about. It could be a bit better but overall we were impressed and will be back!"}
{"text":"With the craft beer experience becoming more and more prevalent, this appropriately named beer lounge gives the market what they are looking for.  A solid craft beer selection and some quality, upscale bar food to complement it.  In theory, this place should be my dream joint - and it's really good, but not mind-blowing like I had hoped. 

The beer list is vast and has great diversity - and largely all on draft.  I was able to try two beers I've never had which is not a easy thing to accomplish.  It's a small place, maybe seating 60 or so. And nearly half are at the massive bar.  Cool, clean and comfortable that also has a nice staff that is knowledgeable about the beer they offer. 

The food was generally good as well.  As many yelpers said, the poutine was great.  Not the best I've had, but it was probably the best item I tried here.  Salty, fresh cut fries, nicely prepared gravy and the poached egg was the kicker.  The chopped salad was also tasty, not much too it but the dressing was delicious.  Wings had nice flavor, but I thought they were pretty overpriced. 

It's a bit of a hike for me, but if I'm around I'll stop by for a beer and some poutine."}
{"text":"The anticipation for Craft Beer Bar to open was worth the while.

I'm big on the way the interior is designed in a place (I'm a sucker for it), so when I walked in I was pleased to see that it was a modern but comfortable setting. I almost wish the place was bigger though because a couple of the tables are awkwardly place and it can be hard to move around.

The beers are great, but run out somewhat fast! So I was sad that I did not get to try some. What I did get to try though was the poutine, risotto and deconstructed cheesecake. It seems like the poutine as of today's date is the only item that is still on the menu that I have tried, which is a shame! The risotto and cheesecake were fantastic and I hope they will make a return.

I can say though that the Poutine is a decently sized portion, and can be shared. So for $11 you are getting your money's worth. The poached egg was perfect with the gravy and if you please to do so you can eat this as a meal on your own. Don't be embarrassed too because it's delicious! 

Definitely going to be going back to Craft!"}
{"text":"On my quest to find the best burgers from non-burger places I decided Craft Beer Bar would be a good place to try. I have friends that come here occasionally and speak highly of both the food and the drink selection. 

Craft Beer Bar is not a huge place. The bar is definitely the main focus but there are about a dozen tables as well with waiter service. I made my order to-go for when they opened at 2:00PM. My order was ready right as I was walking in and the people working seemed to have a very pleasant demeanor.

I ordered one of their Mushroom Swiss Burgers and asked what else on the menu I should get or was extra-unique to them. The person taking my order suggested their Brisket Poutine so I requested an order of that as well.

For the price I thought the portion sizes were very generous and seemed to be made of quality ingredients. However I was not a huge fan of either item. Both seemed overly bland for the amount of ingredients they were made up of. The burger was faily large, had swiss cheese, a few grilled mushrooms, chewy bacon and a beer mustard aïoli. Other than the bacon, the texture of everything was cooked well and the flavors went well together but for me the flavors just didn't really pop.

The poutine was the same way. The brisket and fries were cooked really well. The cheese, egg and gravy were well-proportioned and complimented it well but everything was kind of bland. However, it is poutine and I think that is kind of the idea; it's just not my favorite. I have a friend who does not like a lot of unique or intense flavors in his food and I think he would think both were amazing.

So even though I was not a huge fan of either item, I think they were both made really well for what they were. That and the atmosphere of the restaurant persuade me to rate Craft Beer Bar at 4-stars."}
{"text":"One of the most delightful meals I've had in a long time! We had the Hawaiian barbecue chicken flatbread, the cheese and charcuterie board, garlic fries, beer pretzels, and veggie flatbread. Each dish was prepared fresh and was absolutely delicious. Our server, I think her name was Lauren, was so friendly and her suggestions for food and beer were spot on. There is a nice patio outside and the bathroom was very clean and modern (beer tap for a water faucet!). Our experience at The Craft Bar was nothing short of outstanding, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It isn't often that I feel just as good walking out of a new restaurant as I did walking in! The poutine was the bomb!  Southern Tier 2x's Rye...perfect compliment. 

I pretty much savored every bite and can't wait to try the next dish...fabulous and well done!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time. Our server Lyndsay recommended some great beer flights. Appetizers were spot on."}
{"text":"Place inside and patio is super cute, beer selection good, wish they had a sampler option to be able to taste more beers.  My food was really just good, good but not great. I got the tacos they were tasty but needed a lil' more spice, maybe some kind of hot salsa on the side. The Spanish rice that came with it just was ok, would of preferred some chips and guacamole over rice.  The dip for the pretzels was basically mayonnaise needs something more special for the dip with some bold flavor. Our service was excellent and an enjoyable night sitting out on the patio."}
{"text":"Craft beer bar is a good place to grab a beer (a long list, from local to imports) and eat something. No fuss. Good and friendly service.
Had the burger and was not disappointed. House chips are also very good. 
Portions are well served and price is excellent.
Patio seating as a bonus during pleasant days."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, one of the best new places in the Akron area. We stopped by on Halloween night and the place was packed, standing room only.  But the staff was great about finding us a seat when one came available and took our order right away. 

The beer selection is really good, but not the most expansive I've ever seen. That said, I still had a hard time choosing what to get because there were so many good options. Also, they had a beer from my favorite out-of-state breweries that is really hard to find. 

Ordered the poutine and the scotch egg, both were stellar and the reason I will be going back. 

Quick service from a courteous staff, delicious selection of beer, and really well crafted food.  Thanks for bringing this to Cuyahoga Falls!"}
{"text":"Pretty good first experience. Atmosphere is great and they have a great selection of craft beer...several local including Fat Head's , Millersburg, Platform, and Brew Kettle. Had the pub chips and dip...Top notch homemade chips with good dip. Only $5 at happy hour....maybe still a bit steep for chips and dip. 

Had a limited release flight of sours from Smuttynose - really good. 

My one complaint was there were a few staffing issues. The guy was super nice and knowledgable, but he was eating behind the bar. Gross in my opinion. Another bartender had his laptop up on the bar browsing the web. Just minor issues in professionality that rubbed me the wrong way. IMHO eating behind the bar is super inappropriate. 

Other than that, good all around."}
{"text":"WOW!!  I'm ashamed to say that I only live about a mile from this establishment and I had never been there before last night. I'm not a beer drinker, and yet I absolutely love this place! I had a raspberry beer, which was amazing. I also had a spinach salad with grilled chicken --delicious. My boyfriend and I shared a dessert-cinnamon bread pudding, which was also fantastic. The Decor is really much nicer than I thought  it was going to be from the outside of the building. And the staff is amazing! We definitely will make this one of our regular stops"}
{"text":"Maybe I came here with too high expectations. A date night for mom and dad. I mostly chose the spot cuz hubby likes trying diff beers....me I'm a pretty simple girl beer wise. I liked the atmosphere and decor. Servers were great. I wasnt impressed with the food. Pretty bland in flavor. Would I go back for $68? Probably not. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance of the place. it was fresh and modern but with a rustic touch that made it possible for patrons to relax and enjoy their drinks. They do have food that is presented in cool white ceramic dishes. There were plenty of people eating meals that look delicious and generously portioned. The restaurant actually has a floor to ceiling window into their kitchen so you can see the kitchen staff working as you walk into the restaurant. Transparency in this new day and age is an interesting thing.
This is definitely a place for hipster beer connoisseur. Since I am neither, I cannot comment on the quality of their drafts. The ladies I was with said that they enjoyed their drinks so I will have to take their word on that.
Over all, I enjoyed the experience and would probably come back to try their food. Maybe even one of the fruitier beers that they have on tap."}
{"text":"Fun apps and obviously great selection of beer! Fun atmosphere. Not a ton of seating. We will be making a visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Really amazing food.  This is not your typical pub fare.  If you're here visiting and missing your favorite NYC or SF restaurant then come here.  Oh, yeah, they have beer."}
{"text":"Just had a great time at dinner here. Our server, Lauren, was the perfect combination of laidback and on top of her shit. Thanks, Lauren. Your personality rocks. Also, the beer selection is phenomenal. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Cuyahoga Falls is so fortunate to have this gem. Always packed. Great craft beers and have never had a bad server  so knowledgeable on the beers and food .  Fiance had homemade meatloaf over homemade mashed. And I had BLT on flatbread with pesto spread and fresh mozzarella and spinach with large portion of garlic parmesan cheese.  Would have been enough to share.  So delish. Kudos to staff and chef"}
{"text":"Last minute decision to stop in here, but it was pretty awesome. The barbacoa tacos were excellent and the chicken sandwich was awesome!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT addition to the Akron/Cuyahoga Falls scene. Thoughtful selection of craft beers on tap (as well as bottle) and well thought-out menu. Not too much to choose from, not too little - just right!

Although I could see some thinking portions are on the small side, I thought it was a very fair price for the food. Entrees were anywhere from $13 - $19, including the elk ribs I had! Also,the root vegetable hash was amazing!

Our waitress was very friendly and answered all our questions - if she didn't know, she even asked the chef!

I'd say the only thing that wasn't perfect was the poutine. Don't get me wrong - it was a good poutine (the brussel sprouts were an interesting addition), but my husband and I felt it was a tad under-salted, and the gravy that was poured over top was not as hot as it could have been. Also, call me a purist, but mozzarella is not the kind of cheese curd I expect on poutine. It was good, but it just wasn't what I'd expect. I think overall, I was just expecting a saltier bite, and mozzarella didn't help that cause.

The desert I had was kinda weird, but good, ultimately! I knew it would be somewhat molecular gastronomy inspired, but I was feeling adventurous. Poached pear with chocolate sponge cake and pistachio marscapone cream. I believe there were also these jelly dots around that were maybe grape flavored? It was fun to eat, but not really something I'd order again."}
