{"text":"Wow, what the heck happened to this place?!? I've been to this deli probably 5 times and it's always been excellent, huge sandwhiches, fresh bread, awesome desserts and always packed, Not this time! We stopped in a few days ago after not going for about a year and it was like a new place, not good! No fresh bread, lousy corned beef, two choices for dessert (they always had tons of delish desserts) and we were one of only 3 tables dining at dinner time.  I'm not sure if there is a new owner or what's going on, but wow was I disappointed. Prices seems to be the same but the portions are 1/2 of what they were and the food is just lousy. My corned beef sandwhich was probably one of the worst I've had and the bread was hard as a rock. Such a shame because I really liked this place! I wouldn't recommend it at all!"}
{"text":"Wow...I'm not surprised it closed. Terrible food."}
