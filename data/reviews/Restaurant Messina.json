{"text":"Wonderful dinner here tonight with the family.  Plates are gorgeous and serving size is fair.  Service was wonderful!  Ordered four apps ( regular bruschetta, goat cheese bruschetta, smoked salmon and escargots, then shared arugula salad and poutine among the 4 of us.  Great place!!!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place at night because of the purple lighting.   I ordered the salmon w risotto.  The risotto had alot of cheese.  Together the salmon with all that cheese on risotto did not go well together but separately taste great.  My husband has the chicken avocado salad.  He enjoyed it.  The alcoholic drinks did not taste good.  Service was friendly"}
{"text":"A oublier! Salle de resto en haut qui semble encore en construction. Commande d'un apéritif qu'ils n'ont pas. On reçoit les entrées sans avoir reçu l'apéritif. Soupe trop salée.Plat de résistance copieux mais commande à 32$ faite avec des crevettes de Matane.....sans Matane et sans crevettes. Dessert lilipucien pour une table d'hôte.....on a l'impression de rationnement. Café bof. Toilettes semblent aussi en construction.....Note salée pour une table d'hôte qui n'en est pas une! A oublier sans conteste. Une chance que j'étais bien accompagnée!!!"}
{"text":"I went there with one of my friend who lives about five minutes away and recommended that restaurant to me.  It was a Sunday evening and there were only 3 to 4 tables with clients in the restaurant. I like the ambiance and the Decor.  We did not order any wine because I had to study afterwards but there were a lot of crossed out items on the wine list.  I ordered a pizza with the table hôte and my friend ordered their penne arrabiata.  The salad was good/generous. The portion of the soup was adequate and it was not too salty. Both our dishes were pretty good for the price. I was a bit deceived by the tiramisu which ended up to be tasting like a very sweet dessert not a coffee base dessert.  We had to wait for 30 to 45 minutes to get our bill because the waiter was nowhere to be found at the end of the evening. He did excused himself and said he was doing administrative stuff for closing the restaurant later ...  You had a reason why I did not give a five is because we were freezing.  It cost me $20 plus tax and it cost my friend $16 plus tax so it is very affordable. I would go back!!   They had a lunch menu that cost eight dollars the main plate"}
{"text":"A la base nous devions allés au peche matinal qui est juste à côté, mais la file d'attente nous a découragés surtout avec les enfants. Alors nous avons décidé de tester le brunch du Messina et nous n'avons pas été déçu. Aucune file d'attente là bas, une salle très spacieuse et un service super courtois. Le menu est simple, il n'y a pas un grand choix, mais ça répond à tous les goûts: des gaufres, l'assiette classique, des oeufs bénédictines... Vraiment un excellent choix de restaurant pour le petit déjeuner à essayer pour le souper !"}
