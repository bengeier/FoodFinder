{"text":"Cool place... Very affordable hookahs that actually smoke nicely... I wish they had more Arabic music than funk and hard rock ;)"}
{"text":"Terrible place. No refills for coil. Only one coil if you need a second one they want to charge for a new hookah. Rip off"}
{"text":"Soo I like the ambiance, kind of, it sort of depends on the mood you're in and what your expecting. The place is really small, but they are one of the few hookah places that serve alcohol so thats good.   Their shisha is not good at all to be honest, at least not to my standards, all their shishas are small and weak, didnt have much tobaco, dont generate much smoke, lack the strong flavour you expect from smoking a shisha, all their mixes taste bland, and really just doesnt do it for me.   The atmosphere is really different however than other shisha places. They have a more cozy, warm ambiance feel to the place, which makes them more romantic I guess, so i suppose you can take a date there thats not really into smoking but doesnt mind it, its pretty chill just to hang out there, but dont expect a good shisha from them. They also tend to be packed alot especially on weekends, and sometimes you have to wait 20min just to get a seat, so dont go with  a large group of ppl. If you want a place just to hang out with a couple of friends then this might be a good place for you.   For a more authentic Shisha experience, I would recommend Gitana instead, they're just up the street, their hookahs are way better, and they have more room, plus I like the ambiance there more, but thats just me."}
{"text":"First off, don't be fooled by the price; it might say that the shisha is 9$ but it's 9$ per charcol.Technicly if you smoke a lot of shisha it would have cost you about 25$.  Nonetheless they have a lot of variety and options for the shisha.  If you're from laval, you might want to go there with lower expectations."}
{"text":"My friends, my girlfriend, and I came here after a night that didn't go as we had planned. We walked past this place and decided to end our night in smoky bliss. The one great thing about this place is that it is open late, so you can get your fix after the bar on a night that isn't ending the way you had planned. Forever alone.  We chose a watermelon shisha and waited for our hookah to arrive. The hookah that arrived is very small compared to those you can get at hookah cafe around town. It also came with only one quick light coal and no tongs to move your coal around. Now if I had my mothers heat resistant hands this wouldn't have been a problem. Seriously, those dishes are in boiling hot lava water and she's just scrubbing away. Anyways, we asked for tongs and they were brought shortly.  The service was fine. Our hookah arrived in decent time and our drinks were served promptly.  The place sorta has a dungeon look to it except that the big baddies in the dark are replaced with what looks like couples/bar hookups sitting with their faces real close to each other. These two could mean the same thing depending on your point of view. Blech.  Surprisingly, I would go back to this place. Being the only hookah bar that seems open at this hour (correct me if I'm wrong), it's nice to be able to relax and smoke up after the bar. Most hookah cafe around town will serve a lot better though!"}
{"text":"Had some mixed experiences at the Cafe Hookah Lounge, so 3 stars seems the way to go.  My girlfriend and I wanted a place to get some hookah and get our drink on at the same time, and stumbled upon Cafe Hookah Lounge after wandering around the Quartier Latin. The place is just a couple blocks from the Berri-UQAM metro station and is next to a lot of bars and food joints.  The place is really nicely decorated. Low lighting, wooden tables with padded benches, trendy modern flowing-water-stands that change color, and a cozy semicircular bar. There is also outdoor seating too. Music is relaxing, chill, and doesn't sound like a club for drunk teenagers unlike so many hookah bars. But the best part are the three booths -- where you actually take your shoes off and get to stretch out on a large cushion. EPIC IDEA. Well the booths were taken our first time here so we slid into a table.   Our waiter was pleasant and attentive. Hookah is very well priced ($8.75 a bowl) but the bowls are small, they do not last that long, and they use very cheap and smelly quicklights. Bleh. But hey, it's happy hour Mon-Fri from 4pm to 7pm and there are $3 shots and $5 cocktails so let's not get too down on the experience. Our drinks were on the weaker side, unfortunately.  And then we inhaled that shisha. Ouch. Someone did not prepare this correctly, and the harshness made it unsmokeable. Having some experience with preparing hookah, I figured it was probably due to the tobacco having too much contact with the foil, but they did not give us any tongs to adjust the bowl, and the bowl was much too small for me to do anything by hand without seriously risking burning myself. A shame :( We puffed very lightly on this bowl and then left.  Well the next day we ended up bar-hopping through the same neighborhood, and we decided to give this place a second shot. Hooray, a booth was available! We crawled in and ordered some drinks (splurging on the more expensive cocktails) and these were STROOONG. Better experience already. The hookah this time was very well-prepared and we smoked two bowls. I don't agree with the other reviews about the flavors not being too strong -- they are just about perfect for me.   Unfortunately, our second time there, our waitress could not be more rude. Immediately after bringing us our first hookah and our drinks, she slaps a receipt in front of me and DEMANDED I pay her immediately. What? I can't, like, relax for two seconds? Um...okay....I hand her $25 and she makes change and gives me coins and then stands there staring at me, waiting for her tip. I stare back at her blankly. How could someone be this obnoxious? Awkwardly I give her $2 and she goes away.  She did the exact same thing after our second round of drinks and our second bowl. Ridiculous.  So, mixed experiences. Regardless, it's a nice place to hang out. I would return next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's taken me a few years to write this review and I generally don't even write reviews but I'm still annoyed at what happened.   I was on a trip to montreal heading back to toronto with a few hours to kill. I had lost my bank card and  couldn't deal with in montreal so all I had was the cash on me which wasn't much.   I remember spending over $25 including some tea and when I asked for more hot water, they wouldn't give it to me. Normally I wouldn't care so much but seeing as I had a lot of time to kill and almost no money, this time it mattered. Had the place been busy I would have really understood but it was dead and I'm actually doing them a huge favour by being there.  Also being in hospitality for as long as I have, who the hell doesn't give more  water...NO ONE DOES THAT!   FAIL!"}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure to go into the best hookah bar in Montreal. Amazing staff, wonderful selection of top quality tobacco and a fun environment where you can have some drinks, or even some delicious teas.   Overall an exceptional experience for anyone looking for a relaxed environment!"}
{"text":"Really nice cafe, looks Turkish, plays great american hits at the right volume, serves spirits and great variety of teas. It attracts a descent non-Eastern, slightly hippie crowd. It's also on the hottest block in town, next to several of the best pubs in here and right next to Rue St Cathereine. It's not smoky. It's very chill.  Better than some of the places I've seen in Chi-town."}
{"text":"The best hooka in Montreal. The staff is friendly and the atomoshorte is dark and cozy."}
{"text":"Depuis quelques années à Montréal, le tabamel connaît une popularité grandissante. Fumé dans le narguilé, communément nommé «hookah», il ne cesse de convertir les jeunes adeptes de bouffée parfumée. Le Café Hookah Lounge est probablement l'un des endroits concernés les plus recherchés; et ses prix ne cessent de grimper...et ce, même s'il offre peu d'espace (surtout en hiver car la terrasse est fermée) et se bonde rapidement...  Éclairage rougeâtre tamisé, musique envoûtante aux teintes expérimentales, décoration pseudo orientale (très tendance), l'ambiance est forgée de sorte à accentuer un sentiment d'égarement, en partie causé par la maladresse des fumeurs qui aspirent la fumée à s'en couper le souffle; fumée opaque qui, un fois langoureusement expirée, semble s'emprisonner dans les faibles rayons lumineux dégagés des lanternes métalliques. Rajoutons à cela multitude de coussins, rideaux, banquettes, et l'on se croirait, à un cheveu près, impliqué dans une fumerie d'opium... sans opium... Le choix de saveur est très varié (environ 35) et se targue de leur exclusivité!..   Bières importées disponibles (assez dispendieuses), café et thé. Quelques repas, sans plus, mais le baklava se mange tout seul...  Pour une expérience sensorielle relativement intéressante, laissez en bouche une gorgée de thé fumé et puis inspirez les saveurs fruitées du mélange mystique..."}
{"text":"Variety of shisha and drink options.  Inside is dark design.  Helpful waitresses.  Not giving more than 1 charcoal for shisha cuz head is small, need to get a new head if u finish and still want to smoke"}
{"text":"Great hookah lounge. Visiting from nyc and came here 2 times (writing this at the place). Friday is definitely much busier than Thursday. Regardless, the servers are knowledgeable and friendly. The hookah itself is cheap compared to New York prices at $12 per any flavor, any combination. Having said this, all the sheesha is done after 1 coal, but this is actually a great idea because it never gets harsh. All in all the vibes are great, people are friendly, the music adds to the vibes (rock from all years). Will definitely come here again next time in MTL!"}
{"text":"J'ai souvent été la-bas durant une période. Je ne pouvais me passer du lounge hookah.  L'ambiance feutrée vous emmène dans un autre monde. L'endroit est divisé en ' boxes ' genres de petits salons privés lorsque vous êtes 4 et plus. Vous enlevez vos chaussures et grimpez dans une boîte pleine de coussins, ce qui ajoute a l'allure intimiste et orientale. Il y a également quelques tables et une terrasse en saison.  La musique est toujours exquise et très underground.   Le service est d'ordinaire chaleureux, sauf a quelques reprises ou j'ai été surprise de l'air bête des filles ( surtout en après-midi ).   AVIS : Ils ne prennent pas intérac mais il y a un guichet a l'Intérieur. aussi, vous ne pouvez pas fumer la hookah sans commander un breuvage.   La sélection de breuvages varie des cafés alcoolisés aux drinks réguliers, en passant par les classiques thés & tisanes. Pour ma part je prend toujours une théière de tisane a la menthe, avec miel ou sucre. Avec la shisha il n'y a rien de mieux.  Pour le choix de hookah, les mélanges maison sont une découverte fabuleuse. Faites confiance a votre serveur. Ils offrent aussi les saveurs classiques aux fruits pour les amateurs. Mon mélange de prédilection est le taj-mahal. Je vous le recommande vivement."}
{"text":"Our group of 8 wanted to take a break from the usual bars so we took a table outside.  Our waiter was funny and accommodating. I'm not a hookah expert but it was good and the service was fast. In terms of specialty drinks, this was the first place where I saw \"Extreme Irish Car bombs\" (car bomb but with a full 14oz Guinness).  Smoking outside at a cozy lounge on a beautiful Saturday afternoon never gets old. Love this place.  IFHTP 1"}
{"text":"I loved the cozy, dark atmosphere and enjoyed the rose hookah I had as well. I didnt find the flavour weak. I thought the service was fine, my server didn't speak english too well, but wasn't rude at all."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience here. After we were seated, it took at least 20 minutes for someone to take our order. After another long period of waiting our drinks and hookah finally came. The shisha (we ordered the first of their 'house blends') was some of the weakest I've ever had. We took probably 10 hits before the flavor ran out. The hookahs are small and they do not turn the coal (much less replace them). You must pay as you go which really makes the experience feels rushed. My friend and I both left unhappy."}
{"text":"I loved this place! It's not loud and crowded like the other hookah places downtown and the prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Definitely wouldn't recommend for multiple reasons. Maybe this is just because I'm used to smoking actually in the Middle East, but I was disappointed with the size of the hookah and with the taste. It didn't taste like anything, and didn't even last a single hour as it came with one coal.   Additionally, you are forced to order one drink per person. I had a couple friends who just wanted to hang out and smoke but in order to do that we had to order a whole pitcher of beer or tea which we never wanted. Service is rough on top of it all. Save your money."}
{"text":"This lounge has a weird policy that if you order a hookah, you need to order a drink as well. They also dont provide refill of coals. The hookah is really expensive (12$), since they don't provide any refills. The service was kind of weird, they handed the bill directly to my boyfriend without asking if we wanted to split the bill or if i wanted to pay."}
{"text":"Une place corecte! C'est toujours plaisant d'aller fumer un peu de hookah, par contre l'endroit aurait besoin d'un peu de menage et de renovation. Des trou dans les murs et de la poussière à n'en plus finir, c'est aussi se qui vous accompagne la bas.   Le service etait aussi plustot mauvais, moi et ma copine nous trouvions que la hookah etait trop forte. Nous avons donc averti la serveuse et elle ne nous a meme pas répondu. Elle a seulement lancé une paire de pince sur notre table pour bouger le charbon. (Ce qui evidemment n'a rien changé)  Bref je ne recommande pas cette endroit, bien d'autre fumoire sont plus agréable !"}
{"text":"A small sheesha/hookah lounge that has more of a bar feel than a cafe.   It was dark and a bit loud but not loud enough that you couldn't hear yourself. They offered cheap but not necessarily great quality sheesha, coffee type drinks and alcohol.  There were no appetizers, desserts, or snacks that I saw on their menu.  The seating is limited so when it's busy expect a bit of a wait.  The place was packed with a younger (20 something) crowd.  We waited about 5 minutes then got a seat closer to the back and near the bar, it was small but we were two people so that was okay.  The booth like seat was old and ripped up and the table was a small circle side table type of piece.  It wasn't the most comfortable but it wasn't a deal breaker.    We waited for a few minutes to have our order taken, they were pretty busy that night, and we ordered a strawberry sheesha and two drinks.  The hookah itself was small and wasn't in the best condition.  The sheesha didn't taste that great.  Since I was mostly there for the company, we stayed until the single coal we were given burnt out.  I have been to several hookah spots around Canada and elsewhere and this place made it to the bottom of that list.  I was looking forward to lounging in a hookah cafe with some good beats and a relaxing atmosphere and \"cafe hookah lounge\" did not hit that spot.  It seems there is a lack of knowledge/experience when it comes to being a sheesha/hookah lounge.  TIP: they only accept cash and there is an ATM near the door."}
{"text":"good place with good prices and good variety of hookah flavors.  the only down side was they don't change the coal.  If your coal is done, you will have to get another hookah."}
{"text":"Cozy and eclectic hookah spot on the seasonally busy St. Denis, in December it is dead compared to the protest sized crowds in the summer.   Came in here after my usual 6 hour drive up from NJ to relax a bit with the lady.   Hookah was good and the service was ok, they should probably pay more attention to the hot coals as mine and the guests around me all had burned out coals with a server that had no apparent rush to replace them.   My ladies mint tea was very good and piping hot, which actually annoyed me when I tasted my lukewarm cappuccino and due to my exhaustion could care less at that point to complain.   Some nights it closes at 1am but we were in way past that to about half after and some people being seated around ten minutes to 1am if you think it's worth a shot stopping in late night.   With some minor adjustments this place could easily be a favorite an d somewhere I'd recommend to friends or on my blog www.travelingcoco.com"}
{"text":"Enter the void. Enter the smoke. This is the sheesha or hookah establishment in Montréal. I order a mint hookah with some mint tea and perhaps some Turkish delight or baklava and lounge around for a good length of this your life on earth. Sit in the back on the reclining seats or upstairs! Sitting on pillows is a delight. A night at Café Gitana is a night spent immersed in an atmosphere; ephemeral, otherworldly, perhaps it was a fever dream or writing on the foggy windows on a winter night. Smoke fills the air, smoke fills your head and a song plays in the distance. Is this still Montréal or Istanbul a voice asks; neither in fact but several caravans of Rom en route to everywhere. As-tu le vide ? Have you entered the void? Go into the smoke and you will see what it is. Go into the smoke a and dissipate."}
{"text":"Disclosure : I have been coming to this place for 3 years+ and I decided to make this review after experiencing the following several times..  Their rules towards settling the bill ruins the entire experience. Every time.you order, you're asked to settle.the bill immediately, despite the fact that you might order more and the service is terrible. The staff is always rude, in a hurry and they try to rush you to pay immediately and then they forget about you. This place is in a great location, offers decent shisha and serves alcohol so it's an easy hit however don't expect good service or staff. Perhaps it's the area but if it wasn't for the fact that this place is so conveniently located for me and the cozy seating I would never come here just because of how little care they have when it comes to providing a good service and customer experience."}
{"text":"Most shisha places in Montreal that I've been to, the decor and environment are not really upscale, stylish, or have particular aesthetic to it. But hookah lounge has a nice ambiance and atmosphere I''ve been a regular there since 2008. The shisha is pretty decent and come in lots of flavors. My only complaint is that they only give one coal. But that's ok, you pay for atmosphere right? Full bar and decent service. I'd say the place is decent and if you want to go a nice shisha lounge, this is the place to go to"}
{"text":"I don't know much about hookah, so I won't go too much into that.  Just letting you know.  Well, my fiance and I decided to check this place out after some dinner, we were visiting Montreal for a few days.  This place looked like a fun place to sit down and smoke for a bit.  We got a house blended mix of blueberry, raspberry, and something else, can't remember in our hookah.  The beer selection was good although I opted for a few vodka martini.  The drinks here were the closest thing I could find to an actual cocktail in Montreal.  Everywhere else in Montreal would give you a 1oz measured pour if you asked for something on the rocks and then charge you 8$ plus duties.  You seemed to actually be able to get an almost real drink here.  Come to the states if you want to drink,  I guess.    The lounge was really laid back, and had a good vibe.  There were a lot of locals here, and seemed to be a regular hang out.  The staff was pretty friendly, but if you're from the states, be aware that they bring your bill right away and you're expected to pay and tip the server then  (because they're carrying their own till and you may get a different server for your second round.)  One cultural difference to note, and I'm not sure if it's more common in Quebec/Canada or what.    We had a great time, they played good Indie music, and it was probably the most fun I had at a bar in Montreal."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars because this is my first hookah bar in N America and between a beer and the euphoria flavored tobacco and the double O7/Buddha bar music, the experience was very pleasant.   One complaint: A two straw option would be nice for those who are looking to share a hookah. While sharing is still doable with a free extra mouthpiece, it would be a smoother vibe if there were extra snakes. They also required payment for drinks as soon as they arrived at the table which I found a little annoying. I don't see why you can't simply rack up a tab.  Nonetheless, I suggest a visit for a mellow Montreal interlude."}
{"text":"This is my second hookah cafe in Canada and I had to send the hookah back 2 times it was burnt before I could even smoke it the customer service is horrendous and they still charged me even tho I didn't smoke and it took them 3 times to bring a hookah out that was not messed up. :/"}
{"text":"Super lounge, très relax et une super ambiance. Les mélenges maison son extremement bonnes. Staff de bonne humeur c'est une place a recommender!"}
{"text":"Please save your time and money for another place. They only give you 1 coal for each sheesha (which is undersized), and minimim 1 overpriced drink per person. There are many nearby options for sheesha, no reason to waste your time at this place. If you see this place, best course of action is to continue right past it, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Un seul mot à dire : déception !  J'ai l'habitude de faire des bars à shisha mais celui ci m'à déçu du début à la fin.  Les sièges et la déco sont abîmés et pas très confortable.  Ils donnent 1 charbon pour 1 personne par shisha ce qu'il fait qu'elle se fini très vite et nous donne l'impression qu'ils veulent nous voir partir plus vite.  J'ai commandé un thé à la menthe et ça n'avait pas le vrai goût du thé à la menthe mais plutôt d'un thé vert.  Au moment de payer, ils ne prennent pas la carte interrac..   En bref : vraiment décevant !"}
{"text":"Nice place just for hookah and drinks.  House blends were perfect and drinks recommended by the bar tender are a must.  Located on St Denise close to all the restaurants and Pubs.  Prices were great but be careful gratuity is added on the bill and there is an expectation to pay them more on top of it!   Loved the walking distance between the restaurants and everything was open til late."}
{"text":"Aside for a couple rude waitresses this place is pretty awesome. The ambiance feels really cozy. The flavored tobacco selection is good and so is the tea selection"}
{"text":"The hookah and drinks were cheap but also terrible quality. The hookah was $8 compared to $17 in NY however I rather pay the $17 for legit hookah. The hookah at this bar only lasted 10 mins and they do no replace the coals. Also my Long Island iced tea was majority ice."}
{"text":"I should've looked at the pictures that was my bad. This was the closest hookah bar within walking distance so we decided to give it a try, the hookahs were all small, there were no smoking vents in sight and the shisha that they use is pretty terrible. Our waitress was really nice and helpful, I just expected much more from the area I guess."}
{"text":"Great place, very chill atmosphere. Hookahs are relevantly small compared to other lounges but lasted a good amount of time, perfect for 1-2 people. Girlfriend and I visiting from the states, overall very good experience! Recommend."}
{"text":"Good place with well-priced hookah and less well-priced tea. Sat outside and enjoyed the bustle on the street. The only problem is that you can't get a fresh coal when the first burns out, like you can at any other hookah bar, but you have to buy a new hookah."}
{"text":"After lunch at Confusion, Josh took me to Café Hookah, where I immediately fell in love and became a regular. They have a great selection of shisha and quality hookahs. The only downside is that there is a one coal rule so it'll last about half an hour before you can buy another one. I tried all of their house specialty drinks which were really good, except the Jack Pomme Vert (Jack Daniels and green apple liqueur). I'd rather have Jack and Diet. The Kyoto is unique with its kiwi syrup and the Café Quebecois is awesome with its whiskey and coffee. The owner was nice enough to make me another specialty himself, the Gouache, that is really sweet and tastes like candy and Hawaiian Punch. Not my favorite, but it's good for someone who doesn't like strong drinks, and it looks pretty cool too.  The atmosphere at Hookah is perfect. Dimly lit with brightly colored accents and niches for lounging or booths. There's always great music playing. During the day they play chill songs and at night they play electronic/dub step (and you know I love dub step!). The people who work here really make this place though. Each one of them is fantastic and so friendly, even the owner! Since they have free wifi this place has become my new writing spot. Love love love!"}
{"text":"The previous review is partly right -- the flavor of the hookah is not strong.  But the atmosphere is dark and cool, the bar has nice drinks, the people are mostly late 20 somethings.    I loved the atmosphere -- the waiters are busy, not rude (at least in my experience).  There is a cool back room for a \"private\" sort of affair -- not too many people, and it's semi private, semi open area.  I liked the bar.  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"Great place to chill , smoke and drink a cider.  It was like an Irish bar that has Hookas!"}
{"text":"Petit spot à shisha dans le quartier latin. Ils proposent un grand choix de shisha à saveurs multiples ainsi qu'un grand choix d'alcools de toutes sortes (j'ai pris le cosmopolitan qui était pas mal ainsi que la sangria blanche deluxe, il semblerait qu'elle devait être plus alcoolisée, je n'ai vu aucune différence). Le service est très sympa, jeune et friendly. Toutefois l'endroit est vraiment moche, sombre, les sofas en cuir sont complètement désués, certains sont tellement abimés qu'ils les ont fixé en mettant du scotch tape rouge flash (pas beau à voir). L'endroit à vraiment besoin d'un rafraîchissement."}
{"text":"Great music was nothing but classic old school hip hop when I was here on a Thursday night, great service and decent prices."}
{"text":"Some people might not expect a very cosmopolitan ethnic hookah lounge tourism attraction in Montreal Quebec Canada. Cafe Hookah Lounge is a very relaxing nightclub hookah lounge to smoke flavored tobacco in such as Pineapple, Blueberry, or Lime, cozy ambiance wealthy feeling inside ambiance and outdoor patio seating. Spectacular area of Montreal to meet up with friends, acquaintances, very peaceful invigorating music, and unique hookah lounge environment.   I might find some of Montreal's nightlife overrated compared to reputation, yet there is very easygoing nightlife there, and I didn't expect such a nice hookah lounge in Montreal in an extra vibrant unique neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'd compromise and give Cafe Hookah Lounge 2.5 stars if I could. But I'm giving 3 stars because of the price  Walking in, the place looked pretty blah. The only thing that made the venue look nice were the water bubble color thing, kinda like a lava lamp except without the lava but with bubbles. The crowd was very young, I think it was because it was in the college area. I'm pretty sure that my boyfriend and I were the oldest people in the lounge.  We were seated by the server, and the seating wasn't very comfortable. The server came back to take our order. I wasn't going to get a drink but the server explained that everyone needs to buy a drink there. Okay, so I ordered a $3.50 bottle of water. The shisha was very cheap... about $8. There are solid flavors that you could get or either blends of different flavors which was pretty cool.  When we got out shisha, we tried it but it wasn't working for some reason. The coal was lit up but it wasn't sucking any air. We notified our server and he promptly took away the shisha and brought us another one. He explained that we must suck the air instead of blow in it. No crap Sherlock, we know how to smoke a hookah. I felt insulted by him saying that but I just nodded my head. Then he stood around signifying that he wanted money for everything up front, so we paid him and he left.  Overall, the experience could have been better. Oh well."}
{"text":"If you want a complicated hookah experience filled with many demands and no coal refill this is your place. I am disappointed because the ambience was very nice. However with every hookah you are required to purchase a drink. That's fine but don't expect to stay longer than 30 minutes because your coal will run out and they will require an additional hookah purchase. Flavor was great but will not be coming back."}
{"text":"If I had written this review a year ago I would have given a 4 star rating.  I use to be an owner of a hookah lounge in the US and I found Cafe Hookah to be one of the better hookah lounges I had been to in Montreal.  The quality of tabacco was good but there coals were low quality and there was no option to get more.  Aside from that though, they have an amazing decor and a wide variety of drinks.    The main reason I am giving them a 1 star rating though is because of how unprofessional the staff treated me the last time I was there.  I wanted to introduce a group of friends to the lounge that I frequented on occasion.  When we got there the waitress (who I had never met before) said that we all had to bye a drink.  I had been there many times and never had to by a drink but I conceded and said that was fine and I even paid for 2 drinks since one of my friends wasn't drinking since she had to drive.  After they brought us the hookah though 15 minutes passed and one of the employees came over and told us we had to leave.  The closing time is 3 am and it was right around 2:30 and since they had just served us our hookah and had insisted we buy drinks I insisted that we should at least be given time to finish our drinks.  He said that that night (a saturday night on halloween weekend) they were going to close early.  For what purpose is not entirely important to me but what was important was the fact that they would not budge.  I hadn't even finished my second drink that I only bought because they forced me to and the \"manager\" tried to grab it out of my hand when I said I wasn't going to leave until I finished.  Unprofessional is the word for it.  If you want a bunch of bratty kids serving you who may treat you well if they aren't in a bad mood or they actually feel like working that night then by all means go and have a mediocre smoke at a place with amazing decor and a good selection of drinks - which incidentally they may not let you finish."}
{"text":"Amazing place, and wonderful staff and atmosphere. All the drinks are way too sweet. The shisha is ok.  The customers are mostly locals and more on the hipster side"}
{"text":"My favorite sheesha place in Montreal, by far.   Conveniently located a few steps away from Berri metro station right on St-denis street among all the trendy coffee shops and restaurants, it's a cozy bar / tea shop / lounge all in one. It's got a decent-size terrace during the summer time.   Summer time is buzzing with tourists, winter time is mostly couples, groups and regulars.  Although the sheesha comes with only one coal, the price is affordable and it allows you to smoke more than one flavor without emptying your pockets. Not much to eat though, nachos and olives. So fill up before you come.   Staff is quite friendly, fast and efficient. They take cash and credit, but there's and ATM on site."}
