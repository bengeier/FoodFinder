{"text":"Yes...the service sucks. Yes...the ambiance leaves you wanting \"more\"....but who cares! The food is amazeballs! Best chips and salsa in town and I have never had a bad thing off the menu. This is legit Mexican food and if you are a foodie, you will not be able to shut up about how good your food is while you are eating it. I hope the bad service and horrible decor don't kill this restaurant because the thought of never having those flour chips again makes me wanna cry."}
{"text":"The woman working the drive through window this morning has the absolute worst customer service I've encountered in a long time. She makes it very obvious she hates her job. I'm sure I'm not the only one"}
{"text":"What happened to you Sylvia's?!?! Have been going to Sylvia's for over ten years and have always been a fan. My recent experience was horrible. Service was terrible, was difficult to even get water! Several other tables were in arguments with the manager which made for a less than pleasant experience. Thought the food would still be good but nope! Food was dry and possibly microwaved. I won't ever go back, it's a shame."}
{"text":"The service was bad, the food was bad, and we complained about the food the owner came out and didn't feel anymore comfortable  she argued with us. The only reason why we gave them one star was because the bus girl was nice and she was the only one . They tried to offer my daughters  plate back after taking it away from her for 5 minutes  lol really  like we know what the fuck they did with in for that long"}
{"text":"We recently placed a to go order and while the food was decent, it was overpriced.  We order 2 chicken taco combo plate, a bean burrito and chips.  The total was $24, the chips alone were $6.89 and we didn't even receive salsa. Will likely never return as we can some where else and get a better deal."}
{"text":"The house Margarita was super sweet and not very good. The service was as though we were kind of a bother which is funny because we were the only ones there. We live nearby and have been here prior to the remodel. We finally decided to give the new Sylvia's a try but we were very let down. The manager (or shift lead) was barking orders at the bartender which was uncomfortable. The chips n salsa weren't bad. Maybe it's just timing. But unfortunate."}
{"text":"Nice newly remodeled, I like it , the salsa bar is on point , great restaurant for the neighborhood, the food is good and that's a plus ... glad to be supporting local businesses I will be back good job guys"}
{"text":"Best Machacha anywhere!  Their chips are also great.  They package them and sell them around the state as My Nana's which are also the best you can find at any grocery store.  It is a shame that they have switched to full service from the great order at the counter and find a seat service they used to do.  I would stick with the Machacha burrito, but the Chile Rellenos are pretty tasty as well!"}
{"text":"ok so this place is nothing new to me i have been going here for, i would say 7 years give or take and i am sad to say the changes they have been making are not makin me a happy little pumpkin (?) anyway, i LOVE LOVE LOVE my chips and salsa i mean LOVE. I am sad to say the main reason i went there is to get my \"fix\", because of their amazing salsa and chip bar, 2 kinds of chips and it USE to be 3 kinds of salsas that they had! i made my very own concoction with 2 salsas they had that i mixed together with lemon juice... the taste was beyond words..MMmmMM..

it hasnt been the same since this happened i am heart broken and am now in search of this new salsa out there waiting for me to love.

other than that this place loves to nickel and dimes the change outta ya. ugh! i dunno why.. every time i go its always packed and am sure that the 50 cents they get for refills or the 5 cents for a to-go cup!! can be easily resolved by giving me my salsa back... well i dont think it would help that situation, but omg! seriously? sad. 

dear sylvia's,
please make me happy again so i can go and admire your lovely and amazing pictures of clinton and the pope that grace your walls.

thanks,

love always.. me."}
{"text":"Got take-out from here last night and it was HORRIBLE! Something must have happened because they only had 3 people working and were VERY disorganized. Should have checked the food before we left! Ordered fajitas and there was very little meat... it was beyond ridiculous. Hardly any peppers but a plethora of what looked like stewed tomatoes. Look... I'm a gringa and I know that don't look right and I could do a way better job. The rice was missing completely and there was only one giant pizza pie looking tortilla. We called and the person who answered could barely speak English (which is really not a big deal in my book) but there was no manager around to resolve the situation. We asked for an email so we could send a note about the experience but she was unhelpful. All she offered was for us to come back right then...which if you were as hungry as my fiance was not an option. He gets grumpy and I know better than mess with a grumpy-hungry-pants."}
{"text":"Went into Sylvia's with my father for the first time for lunch the other day.  They served us quickly and were very friendly.  They had delicious fresh chips and salsa right away.  I had the enchilada plate with the beans and rice on the side and it was very good!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Sylvia's for some time now.  We went there on Friday, 4/19/13 and had the worst service we have ever experienced.  We sat at a table on the patio for 20 minutes without anyone ever acknowledging us or taking an order.  We finally went in and ordered two beers since no one seemed interested in us.  The menu stated they had Budweiser and BudLight on draft for $3.00.  However when the beers were ordered, we were told the menu was wrong and they only had BudLight in bottles for $4.00 each.  Not cool.  The patio, while outside, is pretty enclosed.  A nearby patron was smoking an incredibly strong brand of cigarettes and the smoke and stench was just about killing us.  There should be ceiling fans going at all times to keep the air moving.  The whole experience was ridiculous.  We won't be back.  Sorry Sylvia's, but you failed miserably."}
{"text":"This is the original La Canasta visited by President Bill Clinton.  The restaurant is quite small and cramped, but the food is excellent.  For a very resonably priced lunch, try the Workman's special (it's on the menu). I always get the red chili Workman's, but it also comes in green chili as well.  The Workman's comes with red chili meat, beans and rice for a mere $6.49.  It cannot be beat. The staff is very nice, which is a plus in these days of restaurant chains. This place is family owned and operated. To avoid the lunch crowds, you may want to leave for lunch a little early.  The restarant is close to downtown Phoenix for those working downtown or near the Capitol. For those going in a group, be aware they won't do separate checks, and they won't split the check out at the counter.  I guess due to thefts, you cannot pay at the table, you have to pay at the counter on the way out."}
{"text":"I just returned from Sylvia's La Canasta and will NOT be returning.  I have been going to Sylvia's for at least a decade now and have seen the decline of the resturant mostly due to the lack of good servers.  The food is good but I can always get the same thing down the street at Las Compadres with better service.  When I have ordered on the phone been told that it would be 10 minutes and get there about 20 mintues later the food is not ready and they have to put in another order.  I always ask what's the point of calling in if I have to order when I get here again, always no answer.  

Today I walked in didn't bother calling, because well what's the point.  Ordered a #10 got home to start working again and started opening my food, they forgot the rice and beans.  That might not seem like a deal breaker but with all the other crap I have chosen not to go back."}
{"text":"Great service!  We had a sampler plate but did not try the green chile.  After reading Alex's review, I'll have to give the green chile a try before I can give Sylvia's another star.

We waved a server down to tell her that guacamole was missing from our plate and she quickly came back with a big bowl of it.  I left my designer sunglasses there one Sunday and they held on to it until I returned the next Wed."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here last week after driving by. We thought we were going to get some delicious authentic Mexican food....oh were we wrong ! The food is terrible. However our server was really nice which is the only reason I am not giving this place 1 star."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. The atmosphere is good, the prices are good, and the food is edible, but I've had too many problems. I've been there three times and there has been a problem every time.

The first time I went, they overcharged for a menu item. When asked about it, they said they updated the prices but didn't update the menu, and pointed to a small sticker on the menu stating that \"prices are subject to change.\" They ended up fixing the price without an issue. The second time I went, they forgot to put alcohol in the margarita. They ended up replacing the drink without an issue. The third time I went, they overcharged us for drinks at the bar by about 10 bucks. I didn't bring it up. I paid and left. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Meh, food was okay, service was VERY slow and my friend found a piece of bone in her food. Wanted to like it but Thumbs down unfortunately."}
{"text":"great green beef burrito, you can tell its home made, I usually don't even like Mexican food, but very flavorful and original. The home made salsa is my fav."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good.  Food is consistently good.  I would give a 4 star but they lose one because on our last visit they said they will no longer split checks.  Makes it tough when you out to lunch with co-workers in a Credit/Debit card world.  I'll visit once in a while when I have cash but gotta remove them from our regular rotation.  

4 star for food and service.  
-1 for not splitting checks anymore."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here after their renovations... Workers were yelling at each other, my order was first 30 minutes late then it came out completely wrong and had to wait an extra 15 minutes just for them to fix t.. Reficulous"}
{"text":"I've been gone from Sylvia's for awhile, and  I was not impressed on my return visit. I'd never had a bad experience before, but this visit left much to be desired. First, our server was, well, bad. I've been a server, so I know it is a tough job. But she was virtually non-existent (and didn't have a lot of tables to begin with), and when she did come, she messed up drink orders, and messed up my taco order. I used to love their taco shells, but these seemed to be store bought. I wanted beef but got chicken, and I hope the beef tasted better, the chicken was rather bland. My friend didn't think her burrito was very flavorful, either. The bathroom had no usable paper towel dispenser. Just overall nothing like the Sylvia's I remember."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the prices...I have been a fan since the early 80s when it was a favorite lunch spot for staff from Phx Memorial. Great Margaritas! I usually get the machaca chimi which is always very tasty. We also get their green corn tamales at Christmas...what a treat!"}
{"text":"I've had horrible experiences with their very unprofessional and rude waitstaff during each of my last three visits. There won't be a fourth visit to this establishment as a result. I waited several months between each visit hoping that maybe things would improve in the interim but have been treated equally or progressively worse each time. Today when I arrived, a waitress was bitching to someone in the kitchen and only noticed me waiting to be seated as an afterthought. She did finally acknowledge me but only to say she would be with me in a minute and then disappeared. Later she returned and proclaimed loudly to someone in the kitchen that she wouldn't be taking another customer. She then proceeded to seat me and took my drink order and asked if I wanted chips and salsa. Now this place started charging extra for chips and salsa several months ago even though their menu still shows several dishes include chips and salsa. Can you imagine, a Mexican restaurant charging extra for a traditionally free amenity such as this? She disappeared never to return. No one else returned with my drink or chips and salsa or to take my order. While waiting a long time for this to never happen, they did manage to give another diner her check only to have this diner discover it was for someone else's order. More waiting ensued and another couple were seated. A waiter then showed up to take their order and ignored me again. I finally went up to the cashier area and demanded that they please send someone to my table to take my order and pointed out I'd been waiting about 30 minutes. This waiter then came to my table and tried on several excuses such as someone seated me in his section and he didn't know it (I guess he has blinders on). Then he started to interrogate me to try to identify who it was that had seated me. By then I'd had just about enough and got up to leave. All he had to say for himself was that it wasn't his fault. This place gets one star from me only to get the review posted, they deserve none and I strongly suggest you pass on it."}
{"text":"Since I started at my new office in November, I have been exploring all the new restaurants in my area.  When I realized that Sylvia's was close by, I decided to try it out one day.  I had not been to Sylvia's in about 8 years, and that experience was take-out that had to survive all the way back to Tempe (but it did!).  So I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The first thing I noticed was that it is no longer an order at the counter restaurant, it is full-service.  I was a bit bummed about that, because at lunch, I would much rather grab food and go, but I guess I would just have to deal.

I got the green chile beef burro lunch special, beans only...and OMG it was AMAZING!  The beef was tender, the sauce was thick and the flavor was just right.  The burrito was huge, so I had leftovers that made up my dinner!  They also have excellent chips and salsa, with both corn and flour tortilla chips....the flour ones are so good!  The salsa is thick and chunky, and the hot sauce has just enough bite.

I have been to Sylvia's a handful of times over the last couple of month's, and my only gripe is that when you order take-out, you don't get chips and salsa...how rude!"}
{"text":"Whenever I think Mexican food, I think Sylvia's. No other ideas come into my head. I LOVE coming here when I'm in the mood for some authentic Mexican. Everytime I've gone, I've received great service - timely delivery and drink refills. The servers I have had have been very understanding and friendly when I have trouble pronouncing stuff on the menu - I've been to places where I've gotten made fun of by the waiters for pronouncing something wrong!! The food, of course, is DELICIOUS. Perfect proportions, perfect taste. Love Sylvia's."}
{"text":"They have authentic White Menudo. So hard to find in town. They have it only during the weekends. It is Menudo like it will be served in Sonora completely white, The red is like the one is served in Guadalajara. The place was recently remodel. The owner is adorable and they have great service."}
{"text":"Was seated presented with a filthy menu. Waited 5 min for drink order and returned with cold chips in a unlined plastic container. A pepsi for my date and water for me. Manny turned his back and stated I will be back for your order. We were ready but he did not return after 20 min in an unbusy restaurant I got up left and he chased us down in the parking lot I need you to pay for your pepsi. He had no interest in us until that moment. He then said I have your plate and will be calling the police. The place was not very full or busy for a Friday evening every customer means something. The place was unkept and not maintain. Glad I did not eat here after all. Customer service worse. The national chain won out over another sad local restaurant experience in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Decent salsa. Better for breakfast because afternoon they start just dumping grease into every recipe. Don't waste money on the fish tacos or soggy tostadas.  Much better Mexican food around but ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"In my search for the best green chili burro in Phoenix, I always end up coming back here. Their burro is in my top 3 for sure. To be honest I haven't eaten much else here. It's a comfortable place, with a nice shaded patio and cheap beer. I like their chips and salsa, not the usual fair. It's a good place to drop in and grab a quick bite. Margaritas are not impressive, but technically you have to order those from Mateo's next door."}
{"text":"Great food, poor service, but you don't got o Sylvia's for atmosphere or service it is about the food. Always good food and glad it is walking distance from my home!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place for authentic carne asada burritos.  They are the good kind. It's hard to believe authentic carne aside burritos are so hard to find but this place has them.  They also have the best tasting hot sauce in all of Phoenix - that's a fact.  My orders were to go so not sure on the service yet."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat.  It is pretty basic but the food is always good and the place is clean, with seating indoors or outdoors.  They have a chip and salsa bar that is pretty good - lots of different salsa with two types of chips.  Not the best Mexican  food, but for the money it's a  fair deal.  The ambience is nice."}
{"text":"What happened? I haven't been here in a while having moved out of the neighborhood. This place used to be so good. Today, it was not good.

The service - one star. Even though it was not crowded or busy, my waitress moved at a frenzied pace that would make a cup of coffee nervous. I think maybe she had a couple lines for breakfast. 

The table was filthy. It looked like it hadn't had a good cleaning in years, but also was not wiped down from the previous diners. There was lettuce and used sugar packets left behind. I asked for a couple extra napkins and cleaned it myself. 

Food - one star. This place has always had my favorite salsa and still does. The chips however were pathetic. Most of the basket were wet with grease, cold and chewey. Not good. If you cant get chips right, then just shut the doors and go home. 

Not sure what's happened here but this place is no longer being managed. It's a question of trust at this point. So many things were wrong, I can't trust that the food won't hurt me.

Sorry to have to say it Sylvia, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Service wasn't bad, but it could be improved.
But damn the food was good!"}
{"text":"Went there.  20 minutes no service.  Walked out. Shitty service.  I hope the business fail. Waited fur over 20 mins and nothing.  The women working the bar sucks."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos from here and they were really BAD!!!! Me and my wife both had stomach aches about 10 minutes after we ate. I will never eat here again and the service was also bad. Such a shame I can walk here and now they have lost my business as well as everyone I can tell to stay away."}
{"text":"I live a block away and the food is always good. I often come for menudo on saturday mornings. I would rate the food a four star because I don't think they make everything. I highly suspect my menudo is from a can but I like it. I give them 2 stars because the service has consists always sucked. The wait staff always seem to not know what is on the menu. The only saving grace is one particular bartender, where I now usually sit. I love my neighborhood as I can walk to 10-15 five star eateries. If another real Mexican restaurant opens up anywhere close I would quit going to sylvias."}
{"text":"Poor service delivered by a staff who act as if they are hating the work. Food is average but so is the price. Given the wide range of choices in the Mexican category in  Phoenix there is no reason to visit this one at all."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food. It is strictly about their service. It is horrible! As I just got done sitting at our table for 25 min with no drinks, no \"I'll be right with you \" nothing... We got up and began to leave a pretty much empty restaurant our \"waitress\" met us and asked if she could take our order. I let her know it was a bit too late for her token service. So I took my family to another restaurant I KNOW has good service."}
{"text":"Great food and our server Bonita was awesome.  She was very attentive and patient with our indecision on what toouder.  We eill definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"La Pinata closed due to neighbor's gas leak, so we went to Sylvia's to try it out.  OMG - service was terrible, orders were wrong, no refills on soda or water, food was terrible and salsas were below par and too salty.  Never again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend that you not waste your time or your money. Decided to try their advertised Taco Tuesday. Restaurant was not crowded at 5:45 on Tuesday, only had customers at 3 tables. Ordered 6 tacos to go. Took 35 minutes to get the tacos and had to wait 5 more minutes for the sauce. The staff was terribly inattentive to all patrons. The tacos were terrible. A little carne asada with some cilantro on small, stale corn tortillas."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years!  I'm done the service has gotten horrible, the cooks can't get anything right. Was here for breakfast and they were completely out of ice. I really miss the old restaurant.  Good bye"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many of times and this time I thought, why not!  Glad I stopped in.  Friendly wait staff and excellent food.  I will definitely come again!  

Tip, 10% of if you pay cash!"}
{"text":"i've had good and bad experiences here.  food is usually good, but the service is pretty inconsistent.  never really got a \"friendly\" vibe from a server working there, and forget about getting refills on drinks, etc., cuz it ain't gonna happen lol

but, like i said, food is pretty good, and even though i usually get pissed off with the lack of customer service, i go back every few months ... 

price is reasonable, too."}
{"text":"This place definitely did not offer the goodest service.  But I don't blame the poor staff.  I blame the horrid and down right oppressive management and ownership.  We went on 
Cinco de Mayo, and as expected, the place was a little busy. Not too busy, but much too busy for the amount of staff they had scheduled in the Cantina.   The poor guys behind the bar were trying to work their fastest, but they were far too stretched having to take car of a bar, a small dining room, and an outdoor patio.

What shocked me the most was the eponymous owner and her horrific managerial style.  She never asked how any of her staff was doing, or if they needed assistance.  She instead chose to bark orders and treat them as they were nothing more than dogs to be whipped into shape.   This ever so effective leadership style was also emulated by her management team. They demeaned and berated the poor bar staff, and to make her point, the bull dog of a woman in charge bellowed, \"I'm the boss! You will listen to me!\" You would think a business owner would do their best to take care of ugly business behind closed doors, but just like the back rolls accentuated by her ill fitting top, she chose to let it spill out into the open. 

Now for those two poor bartenders,  they were subjected to all of this, but still busted their backs for the boss.  The kicker is, one of the guys there was working his first shift!  He received no training and was trying to learn the ropes on the fly.  Sure there were some mistakes, but who wouldn't perform poorly with two ogre ladies breathing down your neck! The kicker here is that the bosses didn't know which guy was which and kept calling them by the same name!

The food was also disappointing. It took over an hour for us to get our appetizer, which was a sampler platter. the tamale was good enough.  The potato skin even better.  Just feel like a place who knows the goodest would add sour cream.   There was also this crispy mushroom chimi thingy that was alright. 

But the chicken tenders were completely raw when we bit into them.  You would think an hour would be enough time to cook  a 1 oz piece of chicken :/

Drinks were good

Ambiance was tacky

Live mariachi band was cool.


I would most likely not come back as I did not receive the goodest service."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and came out hot and they way it was ordered.  Love the new look, well worth the wait for their return.  Very comfortable.  The staff was very knowledgeable and super friendly. This is one of my new favorite places to go for Mexican. Highly recommend that you stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"It was okay food but no service what so ever. Who ever does the scheduling needs to be fired. Take care of your customers before you dont have anymore!"}
{"text":"Sylvia's is Meh... I really don't have much more to say about it. 

From the walk up and order \"service\" to the salsa bar that children are allowed to play in... meh.

Now, it's not HORRIBLE it's just not the best Mexican I've had. My last trip I had the green chile enchiladas. The chile was not flavorful and I was left unimpressed with their rice and beans. 

Maybe I need to go and order something of the grilled variety and give them another shot. Right now, I remain unimpressed by Sylvia and her Canasta."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the service too. I don't know what people are expecting from waiters... Lol"}
{"text":"Sylvia's is a delicious family-style Mexican restaurant. My friends and I love to go here and hang out while enjoying their huge portions. I'm a big fan of the refried bean chimichanga. Their flour tortilla chips are REALLY good (and unlimited)! They not-so-recently became a full-wait staff restaurant, too. It's nice to be able to sit down and enjoy yourself without having to jump up for a chip and drink refill every 10 minutes. The restaurant itself is clean and has a nice, authentic flair to it. It has a large outside seating area for when the weather is nice. All around a great place to enjoy some laidback Mexican food with family and friends."}
{"text":"it not bad place it used to be fast food type but now it's a sit down but you can still order up front but does it seem the same the food is the same but I'll come back just because LA pinata does do Togo orders"}
{"text":"If a negative score were possible that's what I would give. Attempted to call in a to go order. A female voice answered and when I told her I wanted to place an order to go, she sighed and asked me how big my order was. I explained I would be ordering four items. She then asked me what kind of items but wasn't actually taking my order. I told her a burrito, a combo and then was cut off and told to hold. I stayed on hold for more than 12min. After holding for 7 min, I had already decided I wouldn't be placing any order but part of me wanted to continue holding to see if she actually ever returned to the line. After reading some of the comments and reviews, it's clear that there is some kind of staffing issue.  The food is actually good. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Not good...tables were not clean, waiter was scattered and they charged me $6.00 for a margarita that was worth $2.00.  I have driven past it numerous times and the outside makes you want to go in - but looks are not always as they seem.  Save your time and money - There are to many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix that are better.  We wont be back.

On a good note - the food was pretty good.  But, there is something wrong with the energy of this place."}
{"text":"Tried for happy hour.   Horrible horrible service.    Acted like we were bothering them by being there.    Waiter did not explain happy hour pricing even when ask.    It was really kinda ridiculous.    Margaritas were cheap and good for the price.   2 dollars.   Chips and salsa good.   Everything else we ordered was not.    Tasted like freezer section Mexican food that then microwaved.    Will never come back."}
{"text":"We really used to love the place for the chips and sals bar as well.  Food is good, not excellent. They changed their concept, by ordering in advance and getting it delivered at you table to being waited at the table and having a small basket of chips and salsa served.
It's okay, but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Damn this place is great. Cant beat the prices, the staff is friendly and the food was excellent. I ordered a chimmy that came smothered in sauce and with enough rice and beans to keep me full. I will be headed here again on my next AZ visit for sure"}
{"text":"Just went there with my family. Sylvia's used to be such a nice place. Wasn't spectacular, but it was reliably good. The service tonight was sub-par, and we got charged for every little thing. If you want the fried flour tortilla chips that used to be free as part of the salsa bar that they no longer have, that will cost you $3. Margarita pitchers are $25. They have a salad bar that is free with an order, however it is the saddest salad bar I've ever seen. The high point was when a giant insect started crawling up my leg. At first I thought it was a roach, but thankfully upon closer inspection it turned out to be a huge beetle.

The place has gone downhill since it changed to a full-service restaurant. It is a shame, and unfortunately we will probably never go back."}
{"text":"It truely pains me to have to write this as my family has been going here for over 20 years, but I guess all good things come to an end. If you would have asked me 15 years ago, I would have said their food is the best in town.........today it is mediocre AT BEST and I found two hairs in my food- one a grey hair about 2 inches long, the other about an inch long and I could not determine the color. They have let their food quality slip quite a lot, which in Phoenix Arizona is pretty sad to find sub par Mexican food. The competition for Mexican food here is fierce because of how many restaurants there are, and even though I hate to do so, I will be going to one of a million other Mexican food restaurants from now on. I would think that the insane amount of competition would encourage them to \"up their game\" instead of let it go down the drain. I feel that unless they take some pride in their food, their generic dated menu and very bland food will drive their doors shut."}
{"text":"This establishment is ALL new and really great! They've always had great food and of course their specialty, in my eyes, is the flour tortilla chips! 

I called here for a chimi meal and a kids quesadilla after their neighbor restaurant could simply not make a kids order to go happen. Sylvia's was happy to make my order, take my money, AND give me a delish margarita while I waited for my to go order.

They're also opening a drive thru window ~ BIG WIN for the neighborhood. Thank you Sylvia's for being flexible to your customers' needs and for making me a wonderful dinner To Go!"}
{"text":"I live nearby but have only eaten here a few times.  They recently made the transition to a full-service restaurant, but I must say, I preferred the convenience of ordering at the counter.  I also miss the chips and salsa bar!  The food is decent, but nothing to write home about.  The carne asada tacos, and green chile burros are pretty good, but stay away from the flautas and chimichangas which are pretty flavorless."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to give this place a try. I wish we'd saved our money and time. The service was slow and unfriendly. The salsa tasted like it came from a jar and the food was mediocre at best. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a lower rating, I would. The worst service I have ever experienced. Save yourself a headache and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My first time here and I could not believe how dirty the place was. There were crumbs all over the seats, and dried beans on the table. I was served ice tea in a glass that had lipstick on it from sometime before. 
The food was good and the service was fair. Due to the cleanliness, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"We've been to Sylvia's many times before and had adequate service and fine food. This last time we went we got what seemed to be a nice waitress who helped me order a burrito with green chili and beans. I asked her if the \"enchilada style\" meant that it came with sour cream and guac, and she said that yes, it did, so I ordered it, along with a red chili sauce that she talked me into. On the menu \"enchilada style\" was listed as $1.25. The meal came and it was good, but then the bill came. 

She charged me $3 for the tiny side of guac (listed as a \"large side\" on the receipt), $2 for the tiny side of sour cream (again listed as \"large\" on the receipt), and $1.50 for the side of red sauce. The whole burrito was only $7.99, so it seemed ridiculous to pay $6.50 for the sides. I asked her about it and explained my confusion, and she proceeded to pull out a menu to have me check the price of the \"enchilada style\" and said she would adjust the price of the red sauce to $1.25 for me. Thanks.

According to her, there is only one side of guac - large - despite the fact that it was the same size as the tiny plastic cups for salsa. Seems odd that the receipt would list any size, large or small, if there was only one size available. It was turning brown. Certainly not worth the $3. She then told me that next time I should order a chimichanga to save money. I was surprised she wouldn't just adjust the price this time because of the miscommunication. 

Moral of the story - I feel swindled. We will not return again, and she ended up loosing money on her tip. I would never recommend a place that has such terrible customer service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time today. He had been driving by Sylvia's for a while and wanted to try it. I'm going to just get to the point the food was horrible except for the chili con queso which is an appetizer. The beans were terrible and the rice seemed even worse. It had such an old after taste. The service? The worst we've ever experienced in the 9 years we have been together. The waiter was upset with all the staff, getting mad at them, rolling his eyes and yelling at them all. I've never gone out to eat and have been so uncomfortable and felt so much tension before. Not only was he messing up our order but it was like he was irritated with us for being there. He was not only giving terrible service but was just so irritated i couldn't even ask a question. forget the fact that we would have liked refills on our drinks. We couldn't get out fast enough. Our waiter was named John or Shawn. This was our first and DEFINITELY last time ever! We are also really good tippers but again this is the first time in 9 years that we were forced to give such a bad tip. We did call on the way home but there was no manager to speak with. We told the girl on the phone about it but she obviously wasn't to concerned because she listened, said she was sorry and then click! DO NOT GO HERE, THERE ARE MANY WONDERFUL MEXICAN RESTAURANTS IN THE VALLEY THAT DESERVE YOUR MONEY!"}
{"text":"Okay I will just start from the beginning and get to the end as quickly as possible and as much detail of my horrible experience..
I took my mom out to eat.. highly recommended place by a good friend.. so here we go! Finally some real, authentic mexican food. This was 8/9 at around 2pm..
It's a great location, wonderful looking place! You can see what's going on in the kitchen, kindda.. but it looks very clean and even has an A rating. We ordered, I got a house margarita and it was delicious, only reason this place deserves some type of star!  I mean this place had a great feel, great waitress.. can't remember her name however. I all ready knew what I wanted so it didn't take long to order. I got the carne asada burrito and my mom chose the chicken quesadilla (also a fave of mine).
I was so pleased with everything going on I chose to ignore how fast the food came out, I mean it only took maybe 10 to 15 minutes tops. Okay.. looks good.
First bite I just knew it was over.. I gave it one more good bite for measure and knew I was upset. I may of well have paid less for the bean burrito because that's all I really got with a sprinkle of meat and a bit of guacamole. I asked for no pico because I can't handle hot things. Well the seasoning for the carne asada it seems is so profoundly used not only was it extremely over salted but it made the burrito even more inedible for me because it made it oddly spicy.. and not in a good \"spicy\" way.. look if it's delicious and a tad spicy I will eat it and just regret it later. No, this kind of spicy was like adding too much chili powder of some kind. 
Well next I tried my mom's quesadilla and it tasted like it was made with that canned potted meat, with a sprinkle of cheese and a splash of some kind of bland sauce. It was so gross..
Well after we got our food quick we got slow service after that. I don't know what happened but there was only two guys sitting at a booth and they were there before us. Only one couple of older women came in after we got our food. So they were not packed. 
I'll just cut it short here and say I'm not going back at all. The only way I would come back is if they replaced whoever cooked my food. Because the rest of my experience was good. However I did get upset when I got my bill and found out the hard way I paid an extra five bucks for an extra scoop of sourcream and guacamole. If she would've told me it was that much extra I would of stopped her and said nevermind. It's also my mistake for assuming but still.. 5 bucks for a tiny bowl of half sour cream, half guacamole.. yeah I don't do those.."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a month (sometimes more) and its really good food. Recently renovated, the service is fast and the food seems to be much more consistent than in years passed.  

I would recommend a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place serves some delicious tasting Mexican food. Although the hours they put up on here are not accurate. It says they open at 7am when they really open at 8am. Tried going there with a friend at 7 but the sign on their door had a totally different schedule. I recommend calling them first before you go to make sure they're open. Other than the conflicting hours, the servers are here are so nice and helpful. I definitely suggest it to Mexican food lovers out there."}
{"text":"Wednesday night.  8:30 pm, no clear entrance to the restaurant..  Found a way in, asked an employee if they were still open, didn't see anybody.  She said \"yes, til 10\".  Offered no assistance.  I waited for the host to arrive.  Flippant attitude, disgust ensued.  10-15 minutes later a waiter arrived who couldn't have cared less that I was human.  I ordered a drink and an entree.  I got both at the same time.  I would have expected this service at Taco Bell, and quite honestly, I wish I had gone to Taco Bell, as what I ordered wasn't as good as what I could get at the fast food restaurant.  My suggestion:   Stay as far away at this less than worthy restaurant.  Blech on all accounts.  No, double blech....."}
{"text":"Oh Sylvia, I'm sorry. It's been a good ride but somewhere along the line things started to head south. I think it was around the time they went from an order at the front counter joint to full service restaurant type place a few years back. I wanna say it pains me (in more ways than one but I'll get to that later) to write this review because this place was like home back in the day.
Last Sunday my family met there to celebrate my mom's 61st bday. It was her choice so I thought to myself \"hmmmmm ok...I probably was never going back there but I guess I am at least one more time. Maybe they turned it around.....hmmm.\"
We sat down & received the chips and salsa. The mild salsa was bland & tasted like tomato juice. The chips are tiny, bout half a normal chip. I ordered an horchata but they said they didn't have any. Sacrilege! Oh well, as long as my ma is happy, just order something & be done with it. I had the My Nana's red chile. It was ok. Rice & beans too. We ate, exchanged pleasantries...etc & bounced. About 4 hours later I was relaxing with my thoughts & my woman on the sofa, watching some mind numbing show when I felt a burning sensation in the pit of my belly.
I shifted my weight, changed positions & just plain tried to ignore the feeling but after ten minutes it was inevitable so I made my way to the bathroom. Everything seemed in slo-mo as I made my way down the hallway. I think I even heard my dog mumble 'dead man walking'.
I broke out into a sweat on the pot. Twas then I knew this would be no ordinary deuce session. The burning had now turned into a solar flare as I white knuckled the nearby countertop to brace myself. I shook my head to shed the beads of sweat from my forehead when I suddenly remembered my training...well not my training but my lady's - 'Puuuuuush!' I heard a voice tell me. 'Puuuuuuushhh!' So I did. I never knew a human body could make that noise. Remember me the next time you're at a coffee shop & order a cappuccino. That noise. You know you're in a bad place when you seriously think about calling out for help from your significant other, knowing from the time they enter that room things will never be the same for you two. I managed to get passed round one, battered but not beaten. Things went on for about another 30 minutes or so when I finally had emerged from the darkness. 
An hour later or so my ma text me saying it didn't agree with her either. I didn't ask her for more details nor did I tell her my little version of hell. To be fair, other family members said they were ok. Perhaps it was just something we had in our meals?
You might be thinking that I can't handle the heat. Let me assure you this is not the case my friend. I love spicy food. I'd eat molten lava had it any nutritional value.
Judging by the dried up grime on the menus, I'm just gonna chalk it up to staff issues? Management? Laziness? I don't know, I don't work there. I just know I won't be back & that sucks because while we were there our server was working very hard. Vaya con dios Sylvia's."}
{"text":"If I could give less than I would. The portions were adequate but I would actually like to have some meat with my green chili taste was mediocre and I even tried breakfast with great dissapointed I'm so glad the LA Pinata open up across the street! Not to mention mucho macho taco was just as dissapointing."}
{"text":"Complete fail. Since the drive through has been built, the focus is less on in house customers. 

I would love to tell you how the food was, but we never had the opportunity to eat. There were a total of 6 people in the restaurant with us included. 3 tables of 2. 

There were 3 employees working. 1 cook and 2 people who were doing the following : hosting, waiting tables, busing tables, taking drive in orders and delivering them, cashiering and assisting the cook.

We were first to arrive. Our waitress managed to squeeze in our margarita order in between preparing and delivering drive in orders. After a 10 minute wait, with no offer of water, she informed us they didn't have the ingredients to make a margarita. Of course we could clearly see the patron tequila on the shelve. She didn't know how to make a margarita.

Another 10 minutes passed...  the other diners, who arrived after us, all received their food. At this point, I decided to wait 10 more minutes before saying something.

10 minutes came and went. This now a 30 minute ordeal. Our waitress was in the kitchen helping the cook box up more to go orders. I got up and walked to the kitchen window and advised her we were leaving. She seemed shocked by my statement. I reminded her that we have been waiting for 30 minutes, before the other diners, who were now mid way through their meals.

Thankfully, we drove to Laderra 4 miles away and had an amazing meal and time. 

Do yourself a favor. Stay away from this mismanaged hot mess."}
{"text":"Great food (best green chili in town).  Slow service which was a drag and they could stand to clean the dining area better, but, you can't beat the food...."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles, the home to much (good and bad) Mexican food.  We have tacos made out of cabeza, lengua, tripas, al pastor, carnitaas, carne asada, chicken and fish. Ground beef tacos are hard to find.  And that's how I came to Sylvia's, starving for the taco of my Phoenix childhood.  It did not disappoint, though the iconic taco of my youth is the ground beef taco from a little place that was called Que Pasa on 7th street and Glendale.  RIP, Que Pasa.

The service at Sylvia's is efficient and no-nonsense, and the serve-your-own-salsa bar is great.  They have a sign that begs you to limit your servings to just one, but how can you when the chips and salsa are so good?  Fish tacos were great, too.  Grilled, not battered and fried like LA fish tacos.  I never thought I'd go back to my roots after tasting carne asada tacos from a taco truck, but sometimes a ground beef taco just hits the spot."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. I've been to them all: Los Dos Molinos, Bario Cafe, Old Tortilla Factory....this beats them all. This place is definitely more authentic tasting than the ones listed above as well although it's still not the real deal but to be honest, real Mexico Mexican food is not that good anyway (Menudo anyone).  

Don't be afraid of it's outdoor appearance. It looks like a Liquor store from the outside until you realize it's a restaurant. Inside the restaurant is clean and beautiful. The service is friendly and the food is delicious. Their salsa is not watery nor is it mild and lacking in flavor like all the other restaurants in Phoenix except for Los Dos.

The only problem is its location.  It's at the northeast corner of 7th ave and Buckeye (I-10 and 7th ave) During daylight hours it's safe.  And it's pretty safe on the weekends if you can arrive there before 7 PM but on Friday and Saturday, I wouldn't eat there past 7:30.  There are a lot of police officers who eat there and it's local cop joint so its not that dangerous. YOu will have some homeless dudes ask you for money on your way in or out."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the service is CONSISTENTLY TERRIBLE! It took nearly a half of an hour to make 4 breakfast burritos even though I was the only customer in the place. Cashier didn't have correct change in the drawer and had to wander around the place trying to figure out how to get me my change. Prices have continually gone up with no change or improvement in service. We have been patrons for years because of the food, but keep asking ourselves if it is worth it???"}
{"text":"Good bye Sylvias, hello La Piñata!  Better food, service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"3.5 stars actually.
I've been here before a few years ago and said to myself that I'd like to return and I finally made it back last week.
Sylvia's really does a good job with their chips and salsa-and after all, that's what sort of sets the pace for the meal.  You know the My Nana's tortilla chips you buy at the grocery store?  Same people!
I had the beef tacos lunch plate and they were good, nothing mind blowing, but good.  The rice and beans were not a complete afterthought like some places.  
I'm certain there are better Mexican restaurants but if I'm in the area I would go to Sylvia's again no problem."}
{"text":"I loved this place before it became a be-seated-and-served restaurant...service is atrocious, took forever to take our order, but the food is still ok.  Had to wait 15 minutes just to get our order taken, and they were not that busy...don't know what they're thinking, but service has suffered since the old days..."}
{"text":"Sylvia's La Canasta Mexican Restaurant believes drenching everything in grease makes it better. 

You may as well just buy a block of lard and fry it up with a tortilla. 

Low quality, disgusting food with low quality, rude service."}
{"text":"I'll admit... when a friend picked this as a place for dinner, I was dubious given the 3 star-ness awarded by Yelp.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  

We arrived early and opted to sit at the bar for a bit.  Margaritas were quite good!  Certainly not the best I've ever had but definitely acceptable.  I suspect they may add a wee bit of crack to their tortilla chips because they were ridiculously addictive.  The hot sauce was quite good as well.  

I ordered a rice and beans burro, enchilada style.  While it could have used a bit more sauce, all components were good and melded quite well together.  

Service was a little slow but as we sat in the bar, I find that to be an acceptable compromise.  It's cute inside and has a great patio.  It's extremely affordable as well - margs were $3 during happy hour.  

I'm not in this neighborhood very often, but I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again."}
{"text":"I and the wife had lunch the other day and received a surprise things seem better service was present and trying to be helpful .smiling and it was busy they where great food fast hot great tasting,did take a bet before the ck came but all was good"}
{"text":"If I saw the reviews before stopping in for dinner I would not have eaten here. The front house service is slow.  The food came much sooner than expected and we were happy with the food order. I thought the food was pretty good. Be careful because the plates are extremely hot to touch. The host service was BAD! The waitress placed the receipt and credit card of another customer at our table. The customer was angry to say the least. I believe she was new because the manager came to her aide. But anyway, they are hiring if you're looking for a job, it appears they could use good help. Otherwise, the food was really good and flavorful."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let everyone know that Sylvia's is now a wait-to-be-seated, order-at-your-table restaurant.  They are still working out some kinks -- as in, training waiters to be actual waiters. But, the food is still great!"}
{"text":"For years now, I've been enjoying the food here with my swim teammates and various groups of friends. The restaurant is cozy, service is friendly, and the food is well-seasoned, generous, and rather inexpensive. Lately I've been coming here for their menudo, a dish I didn't care for when I tried them in other places; but this restaurant serves a great menudo on the weekends - so good especially during cold weather. I write this in a state of gastronomic bliss after having one of those steaming bowls of goodness, which came with perfect complements of lemon wedges, chopped scallions and cilantro, and of course their warm, freshly prepared tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Went to this Restaurant Sunday for lunch.  From the outside the place looks clean and a nice place to stop and eat.  We walked in and I walked around to see if there were any servers or if we just ordered and picked up our own food.  I found someone that worked there and they said just to sit anywhere.  I noticed the place was pretty empty on a Sunday, only about 3 other tables were full.  We sat for a couple of minutes when our waitress walks up and hands us some menu's and takes our drink order.  A couple minutes later our drinks arrive and a basket of chips and two types of salsa are served.  Right away I notice the chips are fresh, seemed like they were made that day.  They were nice and hot and just seemed really fresh, very salty but I like mine that way so I was good.  Looking around the surroundings looked very colorful, lots of different colored walls to look at.  They have booths or tables to sit at, and the place looked clean from where I was sitting.  
I ordered chicken flautas al cart and a soda.  My husband got a beef chimichanga and their flavored Ice Tea.  Our food was served pretty fast and was hot.  I got a couple of flautas served on a heaping bed of lettuce with a side of guacamole.  My flautas were pretty good.  The chicken tasted fresh but the flavor needed a little boost of something, can't put my finger on it.  But it was pretty good.  
I tasted my husbands and it was good.  The prices at this place were reasonable, $7-$12 a plate.  The place was a quiet sit down place on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Thank God for locals! I would never have found this little gem if not for my cousin who resides in Phoenix. I was craving authentic Mexican - not the tex-mex tourist stuff found everywhere down here. We decided to go for breakfast and I loved the fact that it's located  in a working-class area. 

As we sat down we were greeted by the hostess with chips and salsa. I ordered my horchata (cinnamon rice milk) and the huevos rancheros. The dish came with a side of refried beans, potatoes and a large flour tortilla. The salsa that was served with the chips was great -it  had a sweet tinge to it. As my dish came out, my jaw hit the table in awe of the enormity of it all. For 5.99 I was expecting a meal that would barely cover the plate. 

The meal was served piping hot and you could tell the server brought it out as soon as it was up. The eggs and salsa were delicious. The tortilla was perfectly soft and the beans were awesome. This was the best breakfast I've ever had anywhere. I'm jealous of people that reside in Phoenix and have the option to come out here to eat. I liked it so much I came back again the next day.  I tried the machaca (pounded beef) con huevos and it was deliciously spicy. Warm, friendly service, excellent food at low prices served in a very nice establishment. It doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast with the family, and it wasn't disappointing. Service was slow, but friendly. They give you free chips which is always nice. The food was reasonably priced ($5-$10 for breakfast items) and kids eat free off the kids menu. The quality of the food wasn't anything impressive, but it tasted good and filled us up- isn't that all you need?"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, and food was mediocre at best. No flavor, overpriced, and nowhere near authentic. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Was a guest recently... will never return. The service was poor and slow.  Staff not motivated to give good service. Overheard staff complaining about 12 hour shifts and no days off. I don't care how good the food is I can't support a business that doesn't respect /care for their employees."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a permanent home in my childhood memories. I grew up in Phoenix, and just about every other Sunday, we'd have dinner at La Canasta. My families favorite ( and still my own ) was the Green chili Beef Burrito, Enchillada Style. So tasty!! 
For desert, I always had the sopapilla with powdered sugar and honey.
Whenever I am in Phoenix, I MUST eat there when i arrive in town, and before i leave!!"}
{"text":"Do you ever think that you're on Punk'D? Or on that ABC show \"What Would You Do with John Quinones\"?

 I was hoping to G-O-D me and my in-laws were on that show. That would have explained why our experience at Sylvia's was so horrific.

I was silently praying that a pseudo celebrity or the \"Great John Q.\" himself would come out of the kitchen with several cameras and a boom mic to get our surprised reaction to the awful food and the restaurant's terrible manager.
 
Well, that didn't happen. So, let me tell you what did.

My wife, her family and I went to Sylvia's for dinner on Wednesday night. It was about 8:30 when we rolled into the parking lot. The restaurant closes at 10PM.
 
\"We're good,\" we thought. We hate being those people who come in half an hour before close.

We walk in to the restaurant and approach the hostess who also became our waitress for the evening.
 
\"Five, please,\" we tell her. She looks at us like she doesn't know what to do. The restaurant looks empty. We think there shouldn't be a problem for seating. But she says to us, \"we don't have any tables for your party, I'll be right back.\"

She runs into the kitchen and returns a few minutes later. She says she can seat us in the bar area.

Hmmm. We took that as \"Oh, we've already cleaned the restaurant area. We'll put you in the bar so we don't have to clean that part again.\"
 
We follow her lead and she honestly seats us in the dark. The bar is so dark. It's so cold and the music is so loud.

 At this point, my brother-in-law says, \"I don't want to eat here anymore, can we go?\"

We try to make the best of the cold, dark, LOUD bar, but after a few minutes we can't take it anymore. I took it upon myself to ask the waitress if we could be re-seated in the dining area.
 
She looked very shocked at the request. I told her the bar area was just way too cold. She smiles and says to me, \"That's fine. Just pick a table\".

 Her telling us that there weren't any tables for us in the dining room initially was way wrong, because we found one just fine.

We re-seat ourselves and she comes back and gets our drink orders and brings some chips. Honestly, she was nice. She had good customer service skills and was very polite. I thought this would be the turn of our evening for a good night.

No.

She brings out the flour chips and they were A-W-F-U-L. My mother-in-law, who is really easy going by the way, said it tasted like it was fried in \"rancid oil\". After tasting it, I was inclined to agree.
 
We thought, \"Well, it is the end of the day. Maybe these are just the chips that weren't eaten during the day.\"

 We get over it. A few minutes later, our waitress comes back and takes our order.

It's about 8:45 at this point. The family orders Mexican food and I ordered their green chili burger. Pretty simple stuff right?

WRONG.

Half an hour later.

My wife gets her food brought out to her. My mother and father-in-law get theirs. Then, my brother-in-law.
 
\"Oh, I'm sorry! Your burger will be out in TWO minutes,\" said the waitress.

\"Gee, that sucks,\" I think to myself. \"It's only two minutes.\"
 
\"That's fine,\" I said to the waitress.

I look over at my wife's food and she says I could have some. I take a bite of the rice and I almost threw up in my mouth.

The rice tasted like it was cooked in bleach.

I grabbed my napkin and spit it out. My wife and mother-in-law look at me as if I'm crazy.
 
\"That's disgusting,\" I said to them.

They both tasted it. They looked like they were going to puke too. My mom-in-law suggested that we tell the waitress the rice was horrible, but my wife said \"Let's wait until he gets his burger.\"
 
I'm sitting at the table. I'm watching my family eat their food. I look at the clock on the wall above the kitchen.

2 minutes goes by.

Then 10.

Then 20.

During that entire time, the waitress was a no-show. She didn't come to say \"You're food is coming right up. I'm sorry about this.\" Nothing.
 
Instead, I got to see everyone eat. They all said their food was \"alright\", but have had it better here before.

 At 25 minutes after the woman said 2 minutes, I see her coming to the table with my burger.

She apologized.

 At this point, it's not even worth eating. I tell her that everyone in my party has already eaten their food. This was out almost half-an-hour later than she said it would be.

 I told her I don't think we should pay for this. She said, you're right. Would you like me to get a box for you?

Still hungry. I said yes.

Then comes the manager. He walks to us like he wants to pick a fight. He stops in front of our table and I'm waiting for him to say he's sorry about the service and that it's not reflective of what they normally are like.
 
No. He's pissed. He's mad that I'm taking the burger and not paying for it. I call him out and say they have terrible service. My mom-in-law chimes in and said everything was horrible. He ignores us, walks away and the burger was comped.

I WILL NEVER BE BACK."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this particular Sylvia's La Canasta a few years ago, and today decided to meet a friend there for lunch. My, how things have changed. In addition to completely revamping the inside decor, the menu has evidently undergone a big overhaul, along with the quality of the food. My machaca taco was \"meh\" at best, and the rice and beans were such a small portion on my plate, I almost didn't find them. The service was acceptable, but I was taken aback that the flour tortilla chips are no longer standard fare with the salsa, and if we wanted those, it would be $4.00 dollars more! WTF?? Sorry....food was not very good and they are charging for things that were once standard fare. Won't be back."}

They had the nerve to microwave sliced cheese on a burrito sized tortilla and call that a quesadilla...

{"text":"I personally love Sylvia. Their tacos can do no wrong being a fan of hardshell tacos. And I also loved the salsa bar they had they have two really amazing salsas. They also used to serve a flour chip but I think you have to ask for that now. This place is changed a lot and went through so many renovations and remodeling but I don't care as long as their tacos don't change I don't think I will stop coming here. The employees seem to be miserable and scared to mess anything up so much that they usually do messed something up so you always have to check and make sure you have all your food and you were charged accordingly. The vibe is kind of strange especially if the owner is there everyone acts like they're scared or nervous. I am so glad that they have the drive through now so you don't really have to deal with the awkwardness. I would say it's a poorly managed restaurant but I keep going back for the food."}
{"text":"I'm giving a single star because they took our order.  We ordered three dozen tamales (chicken, beef, and pork) to-go for up at 3pm on Christmas eve.  When I arrived, the tamales were not ready.  I had to wait for at least 30 minutes while they got my order ready.  Upon opening the two different plastic bags of tamales, none were labeled; only a greasy sticky note was in one bag that read, \"pork\".  We had to open each tamale to determine if it was pork, chicken, or beef.  The tamales were bright orange colored by grease, they had little meat and a    lot of masa. Even my family members who enjoy a lot of masa were disappointed in the greasiness."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there today for lunch.  While I agree with almost all high rated yelp restaurants, I'm afraid I cant o this one.
Ambiance was ok.  Service was Ok.  Food was reasonable enough but we both felt our food just wasn't good enough to bring us back.  
Wife had chicken burrito.  Said there was a lot of chicken but absolutely no taste.
I had two enchilladas, beef since neither cheese nor pork was an option.  They came with the Mexican standard or beans, rice and a dollop of salad.  Beans were ok.  Rice was pretty good and the salad dollop was a salad dollop.
Meat in both enchilladas was either bland also or overwhelmed by the green sauce.  The meat could have been replaced by almost anything and you'd never know it without looking.
With so manygood retaurants in the area, it's hard to justify going back to Sylvia's.  There wasn't anything good enough to bring you back and indeed, we won't be back."}

Almost a native of AZ I've had some great and then some horrible Mexican food, it's pretty sad when you think Macayos is the best you are going to get.  But some central Phoenix friends dragged me there one Sunday afternoon and I've been a fan since.  Their portions are amazing for theprice! I always order the #1 lunch, which is a big taco, tostada and a tamale for $5.50!  This includes all the chips and salsa you can eat.  Their hot sauce style salsa in the squeeze bottle is seriously to die for. I would just squirt it down my throat if I wasn't worried about people staring.  I relocated to Washington 2.5 years ago and deeply regret that I can only get La Canasta when I come to AZ to visit!  We were there for a month in April and went to La Canasta 6 or 7 times and brought 2 pints of hot sauce home!  My favorite breakfast is the Nana's Special and my favorite dinner is the taco, tostada and tamale.  Give it a try... but beware they close early.  They run a brisk take out business, but then you miss out on all that free chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Several years ago Sylvia's was a decent, not great, place to quench my desire for Mexican food? Since then the quality has gone way down. The sauces taste canned, the food is greasy but somehow still dry and the seasoning is limited to pepper. The service leaves a lot to be desired. I gave Sylvia's another try recently and was really disappointed."}
{"text":"We stop here a couple of times a month. We didn't have any of the service slowness problems a few have mentioned, and the food is spicy, hot, and good.  I do miss the salsa bar and yummy flour chips, but get here during happy hour and get them for $2."}
{"text":"Being that I live in San Francisco and only make it to AZ once or twice a year, I'm thankful to get just about any burrito when I'm back home. That being said, Sylvia's burritos are some of the best I've had. I quite enjoy the serve yourself chips (have as much as you want) and the beer selection. I had a simple veggie burrito-  scrumptious. I saved half for the next day's lunch and it was just as good as the night before.
Oh Sylvia, I wish I could whisk you away to SF."}
{"text":"Just sat in the drive through for almost twenty minutes and we were the only car there. The entire time the sodas I had ordered and already paid for were sitting on the counter, ice melting. When I got my food, it wasn't hot, and they forgot a fork or spoon for the rice and beans. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I like the food here, and some of the servers are nice. However, when I say thank you (for bringing me something you should have brought anyway), the answer is NOT, \"uh-huh\"!!!! Who taught people their manners! Who thinks \"uh-huh\" is an appropriate response?!? The response is, \"You're welcome.\" Also, try anticipating my needs. If I pushed the plate away and half the food is still on it, I probably want a box. Also, don't bring my check when you feel like it. I was not done. I may have had another drink, dessert, who knows? As soon as I sat down you asked for my order. WTF is that? Rush, rush. Your table turnover is NOT my problem!"}
{"text":"There is NO consistency with this place. Every time you go in has been remodeled and not always for the better. Flour chips now cost extra. I called for take out during a time they should have been open (Thursday night) and no one answered. I drove by and it was closed even though the door and phone say's they're open during that time. I wish they would get it together because the food is good but customers want consistency."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite dive mexican places in Phoenix.... the place it pretty clean for a mexican place despite the shady looking outside.  Everytime that i have been there i always get the lunch specials... they are a ton of food and cheap (5 to 7 bucks for a large plate)...  The staff is very friendly and they get you in and out in a hurry... i have never been here for dinner... and not sure if i want to... i like being in that area during daylight hours."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 and all of us enjoyed the various salsas and fresh tortilla chips that were brought out. I highly recommend the nanas breakfast plate with red chili. Was phenomenal!!!!! I also would like to mention that the dining area was super clean and the service was 5*.  We will defiantly be eating here again!  Keep up the good work Silvia's"}
{"text":"I've been going to Sylvia's for years.  Now I live in the neighborhood and go at least twice a month.  It's very average Mexican food for Phoenix.  Over the years Sylvia's food quality has gotten worse and their prices have gotten higher.  

Pro:
Good for large groups
Chips and salsa bar
Catering is great for parties at home
Large patio

Con:
Too much dark meat in chicken entrees
Dinner prices are too expensive for what you get
The signs posted by management that hang all over the place telling customers what to do
Obnoxious paint colors"}
{"text":"Food was great and so was the service. Sylvia herself was working tonight and made sure everyone was greeted promptly and was taken care of. The servers-not just ours but all of them were friendly and stopped by our take multiple times to check to see if we needed anything. They had a live band playing and they were pretty good. This was the first time in many months that we had been here and the remodeling they had done is amazing. The decor is beautiful and they really improved the look of the restaurant. Over we had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I love Mexican Food, and I've been going to half a dozen Phoenix restaurants for about 30 years. This Sylvia's and their La Canasta on Indian School are ridiculously delicious! I've probably had 100 of their green chili chimis. The Pico, and two other hot sauces are stellar. One of my all time faves!"}
{"text":"Great staff and great food.  

Just stopped there for lunch this week and was very impressed with what I ordered (#13 I believe).  It is a bit awkward ordering then going to sit down but don't let that stop you from trying it.

The chips and salsa, that was a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"My sister dragged me here tonight and our dining experience did not start off well. We were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes. Other tables were being served so we were wondering what the French was going on! Our waiter took our order he said he would comp our drinks and apologized. I appreciated the gesture and I was over being upset about waiting. I ordered the red chile with rice and beans and sour cream on the side. When I got my meal they forgot the tortillas and my sour cream. The waiter apologized again and said he wouldn't charge me extra for the sour cream. When I took the first bite of my meal I forgot about the bad service and remembered that I come to Sylvia's for the best Mexican food in town and not for the service. The food is worth the crappy service."}
{"text":"Average mexican. Kind of cute little strip mall and a little above average ambience. It's good food, but not necessarily great food. I would say that it is fairly priced though.

I've been here twice and both times there were some strange smells going down.  Anyone know what that's about? Also - what's the deal with mateo's? is it open? isn't it? what's going on there? i don't understand. Input always welcome!"}
{"text":"Went there a few days ago with some friends. Asked if they would split checks and they told us NO. We should have walked out. I travel for work throughout the state for several years and have never encountered a restaurant that wouldn't split checks. At checkout the server did take our different credit cards which was the right thing to do, then the manager came out and explained he was doing us a FAVOR. Well he won't have to do us any more favors as we won't be back. Food isn't that great. They need to lose the attitude."}
{"text":"My daughters wanted menudo and I figured we would give this place a try today. While the menudo was mediocre the service was completely terrible!

1. Waited about 20 minutes to get acknowledged After we sat ourselves . 

2. Never was offered water and I had to get up to get silverware and napkins .

3. Salsa came in little ketchup containers which were never refilled. Chips weren't refilled either .

4. When asked for our drink order (they have Pepsi products so I assumed the diet was Pepsi. The server said they had diet coke , so I asked to have a lime in it and her response was \"well, I'm going to have to cut some then\" 

I could go on and on because I sat there while the servers were yelling and watched other patrons receive the same horrible service. 

We won't be returning, ever (should be Zero stars)"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would.
There were nine of us in our party. When we first got their and told them how many there were no big issues. Other than our party there were two other groups in the entire restraunt. A party of two and another one of four.
The waiter said that they could only divide the checks in four groups and the waitress by the name of Amber said that would have to be into two groups. She then went over to take the sign for us to read it and that was the way it had to be however when we went to read the sign it did say upto 4 checks.
When we got the food their were multiple issues with it from being cold to not providing what was being requested. 
Then they brought the checks over they brought two copies over and said that we had to figure out the costs. Amber said that she was a teacher and that she would be able to assist if needed. She then picked up my purse and said move it and droped the cain and did NOT APPOLOGIZE.
My HIGH SUGGESTION is NEVER go to this restraunt with a group over 5 unless you want cold food AND HORIBLE SERVICE!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but I priced. Also, the restaurant, during my visit, only had 4 tables with customers and the two waitresses were nowhere to be found for drink refills."}
{"text":"We've only been here once and no complaints!  Our waitress was very friendly for our dinner visit. We both order entrees and had enough left over for lunch! You cannot beat amazing meals for under $20 total! Their salsas are incredible as well!"}
{"text":"I will never STEP foot in this restaurant again & won't recommend it.
Sylvia what the Heck is your employees doing to your reputation!?! Your restaurant you've worked so hard for!
My 2 \"dinner plate\" I ordered was missing the rice and beans. I GOT home and noticed so when I called and explained the girl on the phone laughed then kept misunderstanding the whole situation then finally handed phone over to another lady who finally understood.
So when I went to get the other half of my dinner having to drive back, it was a tiny container of rice and beans that wasn't even enough for 2 people. She had the nerve to say \"I paid for that for you since we messed up the order\". The women I am I tried so hard not to go off on her, first of all I paid for that don't act like you did me a favor!
This is my 3rd time here after re opening and I'm so done with this place after the employees keep messing up.
I've met Sylvia before and she is such a nice lady but I pray these employees shape up and cut the snippy attitude out.
$40.00 for 2 chimis and chicken cheese crisp... Rip off, ordered dinners and short us full dinner meals."}
{"text":"This place makes excellent shredded beef (machca) tacos. The meat is tender and so flavorful. I've been here quite a few times and was never disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I had the tamale and menudo and my girlfriend had the Carne Asada quesadilla and all was delicious. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"As far as the breakfast goes, Sylvia's kicks some major arse. It is definitely one of my favorite spots to hit in Phoenix for some b-fast. Lunch or dinner, I cannot comment on, as I only go here for breakfast.

The place has a rockin chips & salsa bar. We start out our Mexi-break-feast by piling up some regular tortilla chips along with some tostada chips in a bowl. For dippin, they've got a red hot sauce, a traditional red salsa with tomato, onions, cilantro, peppers, etc and they also now have a creamy, spicy guaca-salsa, which is delicious!

Their coffee is unique and very good. It is a cinnamon spiced blend, which complements their food very well.

They have many Mexican breakfast items that you would expect, and some that you might not. One of our favorites is the breakfast quesadilla, which is pretty large & perfect for splitting with someone else. This tasty dish includes eggs, cheese, green chiles & some other stuff.

Their hashbrowns are delish and come with green chiles and cheese on top. Order a side of those to complement your meal.

The only reason I didn't give Sylvia's 5/5 is due to their service, which can sometimes be lame. Everything is ordered at the counter (no waiter/waitress) and sometimes there is no one to be found when you need something else. They can also be a pain to deal with if they mess up your order. Today we ordered a side of guacamole & we specifically asked for it on the side. Instead, they put a small amount of guac inside our breakfast quesadilla. When I tried to get a side after the fact due to their screwup, they gave me some flack. Try to improve your customer service a bit Sylvia's."}
{"text":"Have been a fan of La Canasta's Red Chile for ages. Then they closed Richard's that was close to work so in a jonseing frenzy I decided to drive a few extra miles to check out Sylvia's La Canasta.. was totally worth the drive.

Ordered a green chile and red chile burro.. while the red chile was very good the green chile was the real start here! It was tender meat surrounded by a thick and cream like sauce.. haven't had green chile this good in ages!

You order from the counter then you sit and wait for your food. This is not a full service restaurant's, just an fyi. With this in mind I thought that 5 bucks a burrito was a bit steep considering that the burros were rather smallish. For the quality and the all you can eat chips and salsa bar made it worth it. I waddled out of there!"}
{"text":"What made this place unique over other Mexican Restaurants was that they had a Chips & Salsa Bar with 2 kinds of Chips & like 3 kinds of Salsa, well, we returned tonite to discover that they no longer have the Chips & Salsa Bar anymore! We were very disappointed! They now give you a basket of Chips & the Salsa's at your table. There were 4 of us tonight, so the failrly-small basket of Chips went rather fast, so we asked for a refill which was full of broken chips pieces...Come on, people!  I ordered Fajitas and what came out of the kitchen? ...Flauntas! They apologized, so I ate the broken chip pieces while I waited for my Fajitas. The Fajitas was actually pretty good! ...There was a lot of chicken, green peppers, onions. Comes with sour cream, guacamole, tortillas, & salsa...A bit too salty, but very tasty. We also ordered their House Margaritas which were $6... They were on the small side & a lot of ice...We just missed their Happy Hour which is from 4-7 pm, which they are 1/2 off at $3 instead of $6, so, try to go btwn 4-7 pm.  Makes me kinda sad to say that we proabably won't be rtrng to Silvia's becuz the 'draw' was the Chips & Salsa Bar. Why do things always have to change (for the worse?)  :("}
{"text":"Sylvias is closed.went there on 6/6/16 and the whole property is for sale.every thing in that complex is closed.And the food and the service had went down hill for the last several years."}
{"text":"OMG!!! What ever they are serving at La Canasta, IT IS NOT MEXICAN FOOD!!! This place should be named Cacanasta!!! Have gone twice and it is AWE FULL!!!! The chicken soup I had was not chicken soup, it was just some kind of meat with a lot of lard!!! The Cocido tasted so old, the corn in it was coming apart!!! The salsa given with chips was just a can of whole tomatoes and a can of green chills mixed together. Next time some Pace Picante sauce will be so much better.If i could I would give this place a negative star I would!!!!
I'LL NEVER EAT AT THIS PLACE!!! DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!..PLEASE CHANGE THE NAME TO CACANASTA TO BETTER REFLECT THE FOOD THAT THEY DO SERVE!!! ...YUK!!! NASTY!!! SUCIO!!!!"}
{"text":"Save your money... terrible overpriced food and the worst service.  Sylvia needs to stop hiring her inept servers to work there. They have destroyed this place's reputation.   DO NOT GO HERE!!  The staff does not care about the quality of service or food they are sending out.  I know for sure that what I was served was recooked meat.  It is only a matter of time before they kill someone with their filthy poor work standards.  Also, there was dried up food stuck to my menu.  Gross!!"}
{"text":"This business is closed but contrary to what another reviewer posted the other businesses in the complex are open and doing well. I've been here a couple times and wasn't impressed. Staff were nice enough but the place was too loud and the food. Meh.  Go anywhere else and I'd of been happier"}
{"text":"Our visit to Sylvia's La Canasta Mexican Restaurant was, in a word, sub-optimal. We'd seen the place for a couple years and never dropped in but decided the beautiful spring weather was our opportunity to try the nearby patio.

Nothing about the visit was a disaster but, as others have mentioned, the service was painfully slow. This meant long periods without water refills, which made the only-adequate food even less impressive. By the end of the visit we just wanted our check and to be on our way -- naturally, this transaction took 10+ minutes. 

I don't know if I'll go back. Seeing that my experience seems to be the standard (for some time now), I think I'll keep exploring the valley."}
{"text":"I am a glutton for punishment.  Had a very bad experience at Sylvias about 18 months ago.  Went back about 9 months ago and the service was so bad we didn't stay.  Went back yesterday because I was in the area and still think about all of the good meals I have eaten there over the last 30 years.  The food was OK (flour chips are really the driving force here) and service was good.  The problem was they have gotten greedy.  In general the fool is a less than average value but OK.  Unfortunately yesterday we ordered a couple of Micheladas with our breakfast.  If you don't know what that is, its basically a beer with hot sauce and a lime in it service in a salted rim glass.  They served it in a typical 16 oz glass and unlike most other places filled the glass with ice.  It was tasty but . . . they charged us $8 apiece for them.  Really?  Probably 6 ounces of beer, a couple of dashes of hot sauce, a lime and some salt.  I am not poor but come on.  Most restaurants do not show cocktail prices on their menu but you expect they are going to be reasonable.  This is ridiculous and the last straw for this place.  We will NEVER return.  We laughed that someone has opened a Mexican restaurant right across the street.  We will try that next time or make the trip to Aunt Chiladas at the point where they also have flour chips but don't try to rip their customers off.  Get a clue folks.  I have gone from being your best advertiser to telling people never to go there."}
{"text":"this place sucks!! they take forever. i got there and was waiting to be seated when someody finally came and asked how big was the party i said 2 and if u have a booth available (which they did) she said okay let me finish cleaning this one for you. i was on my lunch break and i let her know i went to the restroom when i came back somebody was sitting at my table and i had to wait for a couple more mins. after 15 mins the server finally came to take our drinks and we let him know that we were ready to order he said give me just a second. he took everyone elses order and filled up everybody else's drinks until i called him over and said excuse me ive been sitting here im on my lunch break you just keep walking past me. yet he still made me wait another 5 mins he finally came i had 10 mins of my lunch i told him just put it in a to go box please. another 10 mins and i was late back to work.

oh and can't forget how i only got 2 things out of everything i ordered yet i got charged for everything!! way to go Sylvia's!"}
{"text":"I cant believe a new business (newly remodeled) would have someone like that woman in the window in the drive thru.  Horrible attitude.  What is her deal? This woman is bad for your business..  Oh and the plate we did get was like it was a child plate or something.  Damn it was small.  There seems to be a different menu...amount for the drive thru.  Horrible service."}
{"text":"Ya this breakfast burrito was so disappointing. First off their salsa is literally just chili pepper paste. There was barely any meat in my burrito and they completely forgot the hash browns. I waited 20 mins in drive thru to get food and they took forever to run my card. First and last time going here"}
{"text":"three separate times they've given me the completely wrong order on to go orders..."}
{"text":"This place used to be okay...reliable.

Went on a Saturday afternoon - not a busy time.  Sat there for a while waiting for service and was eventually helped.  I ordered a chicken taco salad and a small cheese crisp.  The plate the taco salad came had a pool of liquid on it - so I tried to move it on to another plate on the table and it collapsed into a disgusting puddle of wetness.  The server kindly offered to bring me another - which I took her up on.  Pretty much the same thing.  I think the lettuce must be very wet or something, I don't know.  The whole salad was mooshy and warm and the chicken tasted like cat food.  Ok, I haven't actually eaten cat food - but it smells like this stuff tasted.  No mas, Sylvia's.  No bueno."}
{"text":"Some of the he worst service I've ever had and only 3 other tables in the whole place."}
{"text":"What was once a great place for a tasteful meal has deteriated to yet another sub par strip mall tenante with lackluster food and inept service."}
{"text":"The food and service has really gone down over the last few years. The remodeling that they did certainly did not help pick up any  business, the place has rarely busy when I go. I had breakfast there this morning which was okay, not great. I ordered an egg and chorizo burrito, it was a bit dry. I would say though, they have great chips and excellent hot sauce. I noticed when I was leaving this morning the sign said on the door they would be closing that location effective January 7th, overall the food has really gone down over the past couple of years but I'm sorry to see them go, they've been a staple in that neighborhood for many years."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and I have been several times over the past three years. The first time I was not all to impressed, but because of the distance to other places I have continued to venture over to Sylvia's.  I my opinion the service at Sylvia's seems to be decreasing every time I go.  Today the server forgot the appetizer, I found a rubber band in our salsa, we had to ask for drink refills after the drinks sat empty for 30 minutes, and they seemed to be all out of the mother's day dessert special at 6pm!!

BOOOO Sylvia's.  I think this might be the last time I have eaten at your establishment."}
{"text":"My bf and I just ate here. We are staying down the road and wanted a good authentic Mexican meal. Phoenix is full of Mexican restaurants and its hard to choose but let me tell you this is one to avoid. It was gross. I had 2 tacos one enchilada. The carne esada taco was ok but everything else was salty and soggy.  We were the only people in the place but it was an odd hour at 3p . I will not be back."}
{"text":"Sylvia, what happened?
We normally do take out from the Indian school location, but we wanted a sit down dinner so here we are. 
First, $6 for a kids meal and the burrito was smaller than a dollar bill, no fries or rice on the side??I ended up giving my son half my plate because he was still visibly hungry. 
Second, store bought taco shells? Really? I thought better of you than that. Indian school has homemade shells (or used to). These came straight out of the Ortega box. Terrible. 
And finally, service. Our server tried really hard, I'll give her that but when I ask for new silverware don't point out that you already gave me some. Clearly you missed the part where I'm sitting with four kids who likely dropped their fork on the floor. And yeah, uhh when a family asks for extra napkins please bring more than two. 
The red Chile was still good, so that is why it's a two star review instead of one. 
So completely blown away by the store bought taco shells."}
{"text":"Honestly so disappointed. I am a Phoenix native and always loved Sylvia's for good authentic Mexican food. I hadn't been there for a few years and today, after the heart walk, a party of 12 of my team members decided to go to Sylvia's for brunch. Big mistake, HUGE mistake. The waitress was very nice but that was the only bright spot in the experience. It took 2 hours to get our food and over 30 minutes to get drinks. As a thank you to my team, I decided to take everyone out and wished I hadn't thought of his place. I was embarrassed based on the service, quality of food, efficiency and even a lack of working bathrooms. Don't go here unless you want to wait way too long (without any other customers in the restaurant), receive poor quality food and not have decent restrooms to use while you wait. Like I said, I hate to write this review but this place has changed for the worse and don't want others to suffer through the same experience."}
{"text":"Sylvia's, what happen to you?  You use to be one of the best mexican restaurants with your awesome flour chips and pollo rico.  However, I came to visit the other night and I haven't been in such a long time.  Of course, I ordered chips, the pollo rico and beef flautas.  Let's just say - I think my expectations were a little too high.  

It's kind of like the hot good looking guy/girl that you were acquainted with in high school.  When you left high school, you had this image of them - the perfect person thinking that their life probably is fabulous now 10-20 years later.  Then you go back to your high school reunion anticipating what you had always thought would happen to Mike. Mike gained 50 lbs, has three kids with three different women, works at a Big O' Tires, and lives at home with his mom.  

Moral of both stories: The ending is quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Pretty good place! Coming from Cali, I have a penchant for Mexican food! I loved the taco combo, it was delicious! Huge portions too, wasn't hungry for hours! The location is good, right by downtown, and the place itself is adorable. The service was good, overall I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I still call this place \"Sylvia's\" from its original name \"Sylvia's La Canasta.\"

Food here is legit. And they have a fully stacked salsa and chip bar to hold you over until your food is ready. The seating area is comfortable and ample, stretching out into the shaded patio looking onto seventh ave. 

The area is nothing to worry about. There are a couple of pockets near there that aren't the best but I wouldn't let it affect my decision to go there or not. . .

When this place opened, it was a small corner store with a few regulars and a growing number of true believers. After a few years, its popularity began to soar so they expanded the restaurant and grew the seating areas. 

What can I say? I'm a softie for bootstraps success stories like this one. 

Food is delicious, authentic and cheap. I highly recommend swinging by for a daily lunch special, but the service and food are worth the trip around the clock."}
{"text":"Wow.  I've been going to Sylvia's since I was a little kid.  When I first started going there (and I was so young that I barely even remember it) it was basically just a long room with bleachers and a window where you ordered food, and some sort of self-service chip area. 

A number of years back they remodeled it but the food & chip bar stayed the same.  The food has always been totally delicious and dependable, typical Mexican fare.  The chips and salsa have always been so freaking awesome--three different types of salsa (the chunky one with cilantro in it is my favorite), and two different types of chips (the wonton style ones are the best!!!).  

But I was just there for the first time in a few weeks, and suddenly, Sylvia's is a full-service restaurant!  No more self-serve chip bar.  Now they bring you a limited quantity of chips and salsa, although they bring you more when you run out.  Still included with the meal, but no longer limitless and self-serve.  

It seems like they were still working out the kinks, our servers were pretty slow and seemed occupied with other things.  Took quite a while to get the check.  I also noticed that they have a full bar now.  I think they used to only have beer, wine, and margaritas.  Now they were offering Washington Apple shots, martinis, well drinks, etc.  

So freaking weird.  I can't believe it's a full-service, sit-down restaurant now.  I really liked the previous style more, but I'm sure I'll keep coming here anyway.  I kept freaking out about how crazy it is that Sylvias has changed, and my boyfriend didn't get it--what's the big deal???  I actually called my parents on my cell phone to tell them the crazy news. 

Anyhow, still delicious Mexican food.  Maybe they were having problems with people taking way too many chips and wasting them, and needed to save some money in this crappy economy."}
{"text":"The good:

 To be honest ,I've had better (this is not a knock against them, just been to a lot of Mexican restaurants), but I think it is very good. Definitely at least a 7 out of 10, even on a bad night. Chips and salsa is very good.

I really like Friday night live music In Mateo's, the bar side of Sylvias.  A band that plays there often, called Picoso, is a real treat!  They are made up of veteran musicians and music teachers, and do some great classic rock cover tunes, from Beatles to Santana. 

they have a nice out door seating area, Spanish tile and a fountain make it very esthetically pleasing and relaxing.

The Bad:

It takes forever to get your order taken.  I've been there probably 20 times, and we go through this every time.  We usually sit in the Mateo bar side.  The bartender and/or waitress takes forever to get us chips, or even to take our order.  They crawl for the drinks, too.  When in the restaurant side, you get faster service, but not by much.

I recommend them, but just go with the expectation of waiting a while for service and inattentive servers."}
{"text":"For $5.99 for daily lunch specials, Sylvia you are the bomb. Kudos for the shredded beef and non-greasy taco. I split your meal into lunch and dinner - and I'm still full!

You are minus a star because you gave me heartburn - your salsa and flour chips are TOO freakin' DELISH for your own good."}
{"text":"Terrible , Walked in, no one in restaurant, we said hello loud a couple of times. Saw two people in kitchen that never looked up. No one came out so we left."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by the reviews.  We had a great experience.  The salsa selection is amazing.    Chicken enchilada was great as were the chicken and machaca tacos.  The crab enchilada was just okay.   Really cool decor."}
{"text":"Have to thank my breos for taking me here with which I would probably have not found this place.  So i was given the disclaimer about this homemade salsa because there is an addiction withdrawal factor.  Holy smackanolies, this salsa was mmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
We killed 2 bottles of this heavenly salsa. 
Had the #1 lunch combo which was a taco, tostada and tamale.  All really good, authentic, and grubbin.  The tamale had a hint of sweetness, which went perfect with my horchata, mmmmmmm!!!!!.  One of the best horchata I've had also, not to chalky not to sweet.  
Service was great although we did get the vip tavo service, free guac and refills.  Lunch time crowd can get quite busy.  I believe this mexican spot was est in the 70s, but its definitely been a local favorite for a long time.  If only they bottled that salsa!"}
{"text":"Where's Shawna? I've been here several times since the remodel and always got great bar service from Shawna. If rumors are true and she's gone, I'm going elsewhere.  There's too many bars on 7th to not expect the best service. 
And fix the damn toilet in the ladies restroom!"}
{"text":"I have frequented Sylvia's for many years prior to their remodel. Tonight was the first time service was HORRIBLE! Waited over 20 minutes to be acknowledged after we were seated. My husband was served two sodas that were so flat, they looked like tea. I ordered Pinot Grigio that was served only after my husband reminded them, 30 minutes later. It was served hot. 
Our order was taken and not written down. The waitress came back to write it down because she forgot. 30 minutes later the other server came over to take our order again because the waitress didn't put it in... we left! So sad! We used to love it!  An hour wasted and we are hungry!"}
{"text":"The food is average, with the exception of the chips. The chips are fantastic. They are a combination of traditional tortilla chips and thick, deep-fried tortilla slices. Very good. The service was bad. Most, if not all, of the servers just don't care and show it."}
{"text":"I quit. Gone are the days of bringing in all of my friends and family to eat at yummy Sylvia's. My boyfriend and I used to go AT LEAST three times a month, but the service just kept getting worse and worse. We stopped going, but really missed the street tacos and flour chips and salsa, so we decided to try again. 

There was about 10 minutes left of happy hour. By the time our waitress came it there was only about 5 minutes left. I asked if I could get a margarita on happy hour and she said it was too late. We ordered flour chips... which we never received. Then, our waitress disappeared for a pretty ridiculous long amount of time. She apologized when she came back explaining that she was held up in the bar section. That's fine. Stuff happens. Then we finally get to put in our dinner order. We were going to split something, but I really wanted to try a navajo taco. Then she disappeared forever again. When we got our food my navajo taco was SUPER burnt, and completely not the kind that I had ordered. We had been there so long at that point that we decided to just go ahead and share. The burrito was good, but not worth the wait. 

Never. Going. Back."}
{"text":"Sylvia's has the best red chili in town. Alexander hit the nail on the head with his review. Sylvia's is the upscale version of Los Compadres down the street in most every way. Salsa bar for fresh pico de gallo (for eat-in only), full bar available next door or beers on ice at the register, and colorful decor throughout.

My problem with Sylvia's is the price you'll pay for counter service. For these prices (basically twice Los's) we should get sit-down service. Well, to each his own. For the sit down service, just go a mile to the east to Manuel's at 7th Street. I have a problem paying an extra $0.85 for a slab of butter with my tortilla and $0.65 for extra cheese, just two examples.

This red chili is the stuff of legend. The meat is roasted just right and falls apart when you fork it and then it melts in your mouth. The red sauce is perfection with its thickness.

They are at their best when putting on their holiday buffet brunches. Scoop your plate full with the guacamole (usually $3.25 each) and the chips (and tortillas) that make La Canasta famous throughout the valley. Oh, and don't forget a healthy helping of the best red chili in town. Yum."}
{"text":"I only had drinks in the bar, Mateo's I believe it's called. The bartender, \"Captain\" Ron was very friendly and made a great margarita....Like I'm sure most bartenders in Phoenix. Chatted with a couple cool ladies sitting at the bar who lived in the area, they said they are regulars and love the place. I will be back to try the food very soon."}
{"text":"Prior to the remodel I would say the service was 3 stars at best. Our recent experience on 01/13 was the WORST ever. 

We've been going here for YEARS. I'm afraid those days are over. 

Waited nearly 5 minutes to be seated. No waiting list. That was the time prior to anyone even acknowledging we were standing there. 

While the food hasn't changed; it still good; the service was horrible. One server. Took us two hours to be seated, order, get served, eat and pay. 

Had to ask constantly for refills on beverages. Server came by once to see if we were ok. 

The salsa \"bowl\" was maybe 2 oz. We asked for a larger bowl; brought us the same damn size. Some chips in the basket were gummy!  Yuck. 

I don't know how anyone feels good serving that. 


The restroom has NO soap. The soap dispenser was empty. They had a bottle of soap on the counter that someone had added water to GROSS. 

One of the stall \"out of order\". 

Light fixtures over the sink; all but one bulb was burned out. 

NO TOILET PAPER. 

Did I mention these just went through a remodel!!!!

To the owners of Sylvia's. I'd recommend new staff and manager before NO ONE comes to visit. Because clearly what's being done now is only hurting your business. 

God luck. We won't be back. I'll drive all the way downtown to La Canasta next time."}
{"text":"This is so disappointing.  I have been patronizing all of the Sylvias & La Canasta restaurants for 15 or so years.  This was the one that started it all for me.  Somewhere around 2008 is when bad thing started.  I dont know if it was the economy or something else but the proprietor began making changes.  The first thing to go was the chip/salsa bar and thats what brought people in; their hot sauce is amazing.
Then strange wooden statues, atm machine, childrens play area with old used toys.  This was about the time I stopped going to this location.  I mean originally they had bad booth benches/tables/chairs, odd pictures of family (glamour shots?) on the walls but the service was good, the wait staff was good so you could deal with it.  Then came the remodels.  All they ever needed to do was get some good tables and chairs and maybe put some decent Mexican style artwork on the walls and Mexican music and this place would be special.  
Today I came back and its sad.  Its about 1/3 the size it used to be and there were only 2 people working.  One was both a waitress AND the cook.  I feel bad for the staff because its clear theres no support from the owner.  2 people working in a restaurant on a saturday.  2 people got up and left while we were there because it was taking so long.  Its no wonder they're losing business.  
Truthfully, if we could go back to 2008 and have Sylvia literally do the OPPOSITE of everything she did, they would be better off.  It had real potential and I always felt attached to it but no more.
I gave 2 stars out of pure nostalgia but I wont be back and thats sad."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha."}
{"text":"I have been to Sylvia's many times. I think they are about average for a Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix. I have had their Chimichangas, green chile burritos, red chile burritos and their bean burritos. 

Their best item is the refried beans. If you are interested in a delicious bean burrito, this is your place. If you are making something that would be complemented with refried beans, come in and order a pint because these beans are delicious. Their tortillas are pretty standard, I think Carolina's make a better tortilla. I think the enchilada sauce could be better but it isn't the worst enchilada sauce I have ever had. 

They have a pretty large bar on 7th ave and Missouri with excellent happy hour specials and live music."}
{"text":"It looks like this place is hit and miss based upon the reviews. Today I went here for the first time and it was a hit! 

The flour tortilla chips are SO good, the corn ones too, but, the flour ones were amazing. I'd never had them at ANY Mexican restaurant before.. Pico de Gallo is also great. I had ala carte for everything. I had a cheese enchilada, chicken taco & tamale. All were very good. The server was friendly and gave drink refills often. When we first arrived, there was nobody to seat us and people on the patio were complaining that nobody had even come out to get drink orders. It almost felt like everyone was taking a lunch break prior to their lunch rush! 

Once seated, we had chips immediately & drinks too. We all had iced tea, so, I can't report on the margaritas. It was solidly good food. I had no complaints at all. I'd return next time I'm in Phoenix! :)"}
{"text":"Have dined in here a few times and have no complaints. They bring out a basket of chips and one bowl of chunky salsa and one bowl of the hot sauce salsa - both are delicious and they refill them too. 
I usually order an enchilada as my meal and it's yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent pork green chile and hash browns for breakfast coupled with fast, friendly service at a great price.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Sylvia's for many years and it is apparent there is new management who have taken over the business.  When I came in, I was seated at a table over by the television set, which was fine.  I was facing the window, so to my right was a group of men already eating their lunch and to my left, was an empty table.  I was given a menu when I sat down,but  no chips, drink order or anything.  A few minutes after I was seated, the same lady seated a man and a woman and immediately gave them their chips.  The next thing I see, they had their drinks and then that same lady (in glasses) was taking their order.  I still had not even received any chips.  I was somewhat ticked off at this point and picked up my purse and left.  I did not say anything, because I am NOT the waitress, I was the customer.  Oh well, they not only lost one customer, but three others because my family would go there too."}
{"text":"It's still hot. They now have table service, and it is terrible. It seems like morale is really low at this place. The hosts and waitstaff look like they all can't wait to leave, and that shines thru while they're \"helping\" you.

If you are looking for great Mexican food, take a trip 8 miles south and go to the Original La Canasta."}
{"text":"Surprise !!!   The prices in menu are not the same on the bill.   Guess which is more ?  Oh it was nicely explained by wait staff after we ate.  Food was bland or I would not have minded.  Our order was screwed up too."}
{"text":"If you come here expecting good service, in the exact same fashion I'd laugh at a crappy comedian. The service is awful, they forget minor things all the time and give seemingly smart ass answers when you have questions.

Me: \"What's Fritanga?\"
Her: \"It's an omelette.\"
Me: \"I know it's a %$#@in' omelette as it SAYS fritanga OMELETTE. But what is fritanga!?\"

Or:

Me: \"Can I get lime instead of lemon?\"
Her: \"It comes with it.\"
Me: \"It says lemon comes with it. I am asking for lime.\"

I THINK it might have to do more with comprehension than anything else. I hope they don't spit in my food.

However, the food is great. I am giving it 3 stars due to horrible service. At least it's not really slow. Their beans are consistently delicious, and their red chile is the best in town. I also really enjoy their chile relleno, but their salsas could use some work.

Go to the one on 7th Ave and Grant. It's much better for some reason."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. Once before they remodeled and again after the remodel. The first time we went the food was good but the service was terrible and the cleanliness was an issue.  We decided to give it another chance after the remodel. There were only two other tables with with people there. They say us all right next to each other which is ridiculous. We could all hear everything being said by the other tables. I sat down and in the booth was a used straw and spilled salsa and food on the cusion. I opened the menu and there was salsa spots on the menus too. Cleanliness has not improved with the new remodel. We ordered and sat there for almost 30 minutes before our food came. We were the only people left in the place when our food got there. This was at 5pm. Our waiter was not very attentive and we had to wait for drink refills. It is unfortunate because the food actually tastes good. We won't be back. I would recommend going across the street to La Pinata. The service is good and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I had lunch here again the other day and I realize I was either very high or absolutely starving last time I ate here. This visit I pretty much had the opposite experience. The food was horrible. The salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my fist, the burrito was dry and bland. They sat us in a room under a TV and it was so loud we could barely talk. I'll have to go back though... At least give them one more shot.."}
{"text":"The remodel has not been kind to this place. I ordered a beef taco and got served a tiny nasty looking chicken taco on a grocery store hard taco shell. The Cinco de mayo special margarita tasted like sugar water. At least the chips and salsa were good. I remember this place being much better in the past. It seems like they are trying to offer inexpensive specials which I appreciate but the stuff coming out of the kitchen is just gross. The 5.99 taco special at the new drive through were barely edible, grey ground beef, odd flavor and so watery the tacos feel apart immediately.  With two other taco places across the street I don't know how they are going to make it."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican burrito I have ever had. Julian, the waiter, couldn't get my husband's order right. Tacky dining areas with bookshelf in front without any meaning. Looks like they tried to create vintage vibe but were too cheap, so bought old furniture from yard sales. 

So the burrito - it was ground beef burrito with supposedly cheese and onions. Not much cheese or onions, but tortilla was two-fold. Ground beef was overly ground with watered down spices. Chipotle seems amazing in comparison."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. When me and boyfriend first arrived we stood in the door way for about 4 minutes before we were seated, we were never greeted. There was only two other families in the resturant at the time. The female manager who was also our server,  came up didn't introduced herself or greet us, instead she grabbed two menus and walked away and placed them on a table then looked at us as a gesture to sit there. We sat down at and ordered our food. I ran out of water and was not offered another glass, i had to ask. I was served cold stale rice along with our order also being incorrect. While waiting for our food  the server sat another couple in the same manner she sat us and made it very apparent that was the quality of service given at the restaurant. If your looking to be treated properly this is not the place to come."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't give it any stars.  Decided to try Sylvia's for the first time today. 
Terrible. Husband ordered a drink... I ordered a beer. Ordered an appetizer as well. 
Beer was delivered. No glass. Asked for one. 
Appetizer came. ( still no drink for husband)
His drink was supposed to have Tres Generations tequila in it. I see the \" bartender\" take Patron off the shelf. Big difference. 
I went up and asked. He said they don't carry Tres Generations. That would have been nice to know when he ordered. 
Saw him straw test it as well as straw for a customer at the bar. Clearly has no idea how to make a drink. Really? It was a $9 Signature cocktail. 
No silverware... got up to get it myself. 
Now the best part.... Food comes and our server proceeds to leave the establishment. 
We are just about done with our mediocre meal.... and in walks our server with phone up to get ear and a Starbucks coffee in her hand. Un-freakin-believable. 
Brings check and says I'll be your cashier... how was everything. A little too late for that. 
NEVER AGAIN. 
There are too many great places in our area to go here. Stay away."}
{"text":"First time here since the remodel. I used the drive through and ordered 5 taco's. The woman in the drive through wasn't very friendly. She seemed like she was in a hurry and gave me the feeling that I was an inconvenience. For an empty parking lot and no cars in the drive through, she could have at least faked it for a minute. After I arrived home I was disappointed that my tacos didn't come with any hot sauce. I'm not sure if I was suppose to ask for that separately or if it was left out in error. The tacos were equally disappointing. They had no flavor. The meat tasted like it was from taco bell. Sylvia's should be embarrassed to sell these taco's and consider themselves a Mexican Food restaurant. This probably sounds harsh, but honestly, taco bell has better tacos. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but if you can't get a taco right, you have big problems! In the event that Sylvia's reads this, I would suggest customer service training with your servers. As far as the food, I don't know what to say? Really wanted to like this place... so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Close your doors!! Food =taco bell service-terrible 
Asked to speak to manager ya she was the horrible service.  SAd But True.  Phx landmark no more"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service really wasn't all that. In fact it was terrible. We came in on a Friday night around 9:30 PM it wasn't crowded but it took 20 minutes before staff noticed us seated waiting to order. The waitress provided lousy service by not checking on us till it came time to pay. The music was blasting from their cantina which made it difficult to hear much less have a conversation. I would not recommend this place unless you want 2nd rate service and have extra patience."}
{"text":"Wish I would have read the reviews before ordering on UberEATS. Decided after placing the order that we needed a side of rice. Called UberEATS who contacted the restaurant, the restaurant told them I had to call in. I called Sylvia's and asked that the side be added to my order(which I know restaurants can do when an order is placed through UberEATS) only to be told they \"don't do that\" and then put on hold by the rudest woman (Amanda) because she was \"too busy there\" her words not mine. Over 10 minutes on hold, in that time my order was picked up and delivered. Needless to say worst customer service and I won't ever be ordering from here again.

UPDATE: 

Food arrived and although I repeatedly wrote extra hot sauce they sent one tiny cup of hot sauce/salsa for an order for 2 burritos. FAIL."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and the service was comically bad. The refried beans tasted like they came out of a can and warmed up in a microwave. The chile relleno was bland and mealy. 

I kept having to ask for the server to bring my iced tea several times after she brought everyone else's drinks. 

I ordered a side of rice and beans (apparently the chile relleno doesn't come with it), which the server didn't bring when she brought the entree. I asked the server about it, and she brought just the beans. I had to ask again for the rice. 

Then she kept bringing the wrong check. One person had to ask three different times. It was absurd. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town.
They have the usual/expected menu, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc., at really reasonable prices. In the years that I have been going there the food has always been delicious and everyone I have taken has been won over. 
The staff is friendly and attentive, I have always had really good service.
I can't say enough about La Canasta. This place is awesome.
Two things, though, the dining room closes at 7 pm and they don't do separate checks."}
{"text":"Sylvia's is one of a few decent Mexican restaurants where you can sit at a real table to take your time eating instead of scarfing your food at a teeny diner-style table, in your car, or waiting until you get home.  

Their new cost-cutting measures aren't very customer friendly, but everyone is pinching pennies these days, and Sylvia's is my neighbor. I think there is a sign that says Sylvia's doesn't use lard. 

Sylvia's also sells both regular and mini-tamales in bulk, which are great for parties. I've ordered the minis and then frozen the extras. They were a big hit (I ordered extra)."}
{"text":"I get the feeling it's on its way out, which is sad.

Sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender appeared to have been injured and walked with a stoop. I felt sorry for him as he struggled to provide things like set-ups and drinks. We waited far too long for a simple order (Nana's chili and a burrito). The food was bland when it finally arrived. The only napkins were cocktail napkins. Even the check took too long to get there. The guy obviously needed help, but no one was helping him.

Too many other better choices around. I can't think of a reason for a return visit."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit to this delightful family establishment.  I was seated promptly by Amanda, a very friendly and accommodating server. The chips and salsa very fresh, I especially liked the red sauce!  I ordered a bowl of the green chili, delish, I think the flour tortilla was home made!! All of the food came out in a very timely manor, add all of this plus the welcoming environment I would definitely recommend for a great lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I grew up going to the Sylvia's on Van Buren so I was excited when I found this location. Sadly though it's terrible. The renovation is cute but it can't mask the terrible service and people it employs. Service is really slow and they are pretty rude. The drive thru was a great addition in theory so you could still get food and not have to deal with the service BUT that too sadly was a major fail. We live about 5 minutes away and my food was cold when we got home to eat it. I also ordered a shrimp plate for my 17 month old but it was too spicy for him to eat so he didn't get a meal. I called just to notify them of the issue and there was no manager. I called again the next day and no one answered. I called again today and got he most rude unprofessional person I ever encountered. I won't go into detail but if a manager wants to contact me I will provide more information. She also said they are closing in a few days which is no surprise after the experience I had over the phone with a girl who gave me two fake names. Today is 1/3 and I spoke with her (name starts with a B) around 2:30.  I will be disputing these the charges as I did not receive the correct goods or services. We had to trash the whole meal."}
{"text":"This place has a drive thru.  I ordered the number 10 it was actually very good food and very fast service I will definitely be going there again"}
{"text":"So excited for the cute lil patio. Waited 40 minutes for a queso dip appetizer, another hour after for our chimichangas. They were just full of excuses too. Offered us a whopping 10 percent discount. Wow thanks. This was a second chance for my company who had the same problem the time before. Won't waste the time or money to come back. Every table on the patio was complaining. They weren't that busy and that kind of food is already prepped. Ugh."}
{"text":"Well, my husband really liked his dish a breakfast burrito, but I ordered beef fajitas. They were gross, not good flavor, very greasy. I had to go out elsewhere after I got home with our take out. Whatever you do, don't get the fajitas."}
{"text":"They had a cute patio, too bad it's too cold to be sitting outside.

When my boyfriend and I walked in, we got confused. No one came to us, greeted us or anything. We had to walk into another room, then they sat us down.

Omgggg chip and salsa is sooo yummmmyyy. We had to ask dor seconds. Lolz 

I had the vegetarian chimichanga dinner, it was very crispy and delicious, the texture was just right. The bean though, was amazing. Something about the beans was really good. :)))

Steak fritanga ;; he said \" i loveed, it was so muchhh food.I am full.\"

I shall return"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I went here before with my boss and I had their Machaca tacos...and this is when I fell in love with Machaca. 

I went here again for breakfast this time with my boss. I had the Machaca con Huevos and oh my...it was amazingly delicious! The really cool thing about going here for breakfast was that they still serve chips and salsa right way. It was great! They have traditional chips, but they're chips are like wontons. It's really good!

Service has been great every single time I've been here. It's a definitely must-try place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Placed an order through UberEATS figuring that I'd give them a shot. An ill fated choice on my part considering that we received completely wrong items. Never again will I order from here."}
{"text":"I can speak for the ground beef enchiladas, tacos and their own style hot sauce! The are the best in town. Yes, sometimes a wait with lower help than it appears needed. But not always the case. Sometimes, it's fine in that regard too."}
{"text":"I'v worked there and the place is DISGUSTING in the back. Go check the back out for yourself man!"}
{"text":"I wish there was less than 1 star because now that they don't have flour chips there is no point..... It is just another Mexican restaurant :-( Super bummer."}
{"text":"If it were at all possible to make that a -5 stars I would.  Went here for dinner New Year's Day , they were open...surprise! By the end of the evening my stomach went sour and worsens as the night went on... Now two days later I'm still suffering through this second day of stomach virus. That which I can only trace back to this establishment. More than half my dining party all came down with some sort of virus. I've been spewing the most vile concoction of nastiness which I will not go into farther.   
This place is disgusting.  I certainly do not suggest going here.  

I hope we all recover.

OFF MY LIST PERMINENTLY"}
{"text":"Friday special was okay.  Group of 4 we tried 3 deserts and they were not good, nothing like the picture and very tasteless.  Service could have been better.  $1.75 margaritas were good and so were the prices."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for nice place to have a bite to eat with a few drinks early one evening. We decided to stop in at Sylvia's as we'd been there once before several weeks prior and had had a pleasant time at the bar.

This visit however......ENTER THE DRAGON!!......the  bar portion of the business was closed due to its being used for a 'private party'. We found this out by asking the restaurant personnel why the bar was closed. We asked if we could order snacks and drinks while seated in the restaurant instead of sitting in the closed off bar; we were told that that would be ok and we were taken to a table, seated and were brought complimentary chips and salsa; there was only one other table in use at the time. Shortly, as our waiter/host(?) turned to leave from the table next to us where he had been taking their order, we asked for a couple of margaritas; no response from the waiter was forth coming. Several minutes later, a different waiter appeared and served the drinks ordered to the four people at that table next to us. I again tried to order from that waiter, too....his response was to quite sternly say, \"I'll take your order when I get a chance.\"  Again, there were only two tables with a total of six patrons in the restaurant at that time.  We sat at our table for fifteen more minutes waiting for someone show us some hospitality and to let us spend some money in Sylvia's.  No one ever did come back to our table to take our order...........it was more than obvious that we were being snubbed by  Sylvia's. I have no clue at to why this was being done. We were merely sitting at our table waiting for our order to be taken.

After sitting unattended at our table for sometime, it became obvious that we weren't welcome at Sylvia's. We left and found a more friendly place to spend our money.....after all, I didn't want to have taken a shower for nothing."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Special thanks to Benita who was very kind and helpful when an uber driver gave out the incorrect order. She walked me through the process and even took my name and number for the owner Sylvia- who called Benita back within minutes to help resolve. I appreciate it so much, very refreshing. Thank you Benita and Sylvia."}
{"text":"Oiliest corn chips I've had in years, and the two salsas had no spice level to speak of, including the \"hot sauce\".  Huevos Rancheros was a rather small portion for the price, and the hasbrowns were simple shredded variety.  Tortillas were nice, and wife's burrito was much better.  They are full service now, and the service was just ok.  Place looks sketchy and somewhat run down during the day.  I probably would not have stopped if I hadn't heard a few good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I only go here because I don't have too many choices walking distance from work... But it's not the bomb!  It's average Mexican food.  But see I'm Mexican and cook original mexican food all the time. I promise u both my Spanish rice and my refried beans are way better than what these people serve up..."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  There was a time when Sylvia's was a consistent but not mentionable Mexican food.  I have no idea what happened but the ordering system is different.  We waited 10 minutes to get seated by one of what appeared to be 2 women working the whole place.  My mother and I were seated, she is 88 and asked for directions to restroom and ignored.  She found it on her own.  We waites for another 20 minutes before we got chips and salsa and our order taken by one of the two women.  Mom got a beef machaca chimichanga she enjoyed.  It was big and the beef was tasty and seasoned well.  I got the chicken flautas.  I. Can't. Even.  These were canned chicken - unseasoned - rolled in a flour (not corn as indicated) tortilla.  Cutting through these tubes if fried chicken torpedoes was an adventure in civilized eating.  I went paleo and picked them up and ate them like a rib.  The taste was non existent.  As we waited for another 20 minutes to have our bill brought I saw that there was a help wanted NOW sign in every window.  I also saw La Piñata moving in across the street and realized we were there us the death throes of a mediocre mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Back when I was meeting new people, soon after moving here from Ohio, we went here on a Friday for happy hour. I wasn't impressed then; I'm not impressed now.

Sylvia's reminds me of that former lover, without whom I couldn't imagine breathing much less going on with life. But after some time apart, you realize that there is more to living. And when you have them back in your life you understand that your time apart was the best time ever. Now, you think it was a mistake to ever get involved. That's how Sylvia's plays in my life. It was there at a time when I thought it was necessary but have grown to understand we were never meant to be.

Sorry Sylvia's. I'm taking my class ring back."}
