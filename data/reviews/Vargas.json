{"text":"If you are part of a large bachelor party, and have the room in the back (wink, wink), this place is for you. If not, I'd stay away; I'm sure there is better food in the city. 

I had the spicy Thai shrimp to start, which tasted frozen/out of a box. My burger was overdone, and only tasted like the mayo-based sauce that it was drenched in. The cheesecake was decent, but definitely not homemade.

The service/space/price were all great, but I wouldn't recommend it.... and more importantly, if you are not part of the bachelor party in the private room - do not sit next to that curtain, unless you enjoy strange noises with your steak."}
{"text":"I've always believed that if you didn't have anything nice to say then you should keep quiet but alas my recent dining experience at Vargas has compelled me to come forward.  Even though the world may end on Dec 21, 2012 (which I don't think it will), I feel I must warn my fellow foodies to avoid this place at all costs.  If I can keep one person from eating at Vargas I will die a happy man :)

My dining experience started with average expectations upon entering.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately (I made reservations).  From there the dining experience went down hill.  I was not particularly happy with the overall decor, it reminded me of being in a large dance hall and I felt like I was eating on the dance floor.

Our waiter was this old man who had absolutely no idea how to engage customers.  It took 15 minutes for him to take drink orders and after 30 minutes I reminded him that we did not get any bread yet.  I saw other people coming in and getting bread and drink orders long before us.  When he did take our orders he was extremely unhelpful and rude when we had questions about the menu.

After placing our orders my friend went to the washroom at which point he saw one of the kitchen staff use the urinal and then walk out without washing his hands.  We did confirm that he was somewhere on the cooking line because you can see them preparing your food.  At that point I should have left but we stayed.  My steak was ok but nothing extraordinary and definitely not worth the $40 they charge.  My meal came to $75 (no tip left) and it still upsets me that I spent that much on this place.

I would like to reiterate the main theme from many of the other reviews of this restaurant: the food is way overpriced for what  you get and really isn't that great.  I did mention to the manager about seeing this staff member not washing his hands and I felt like he brushed it off.  Rest assured as long as there is a breath of life in this body I will never be going here again.

BOTTOM LINE: Avoid this restaurant at all costs.  There are so many great dining experiences in Montreal and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was good till the end of the meal when the server gave us our desert and disappeared for 40+ minutes.  We have no drinks or anything.  We finally flagged another server down for our bill.  
Everything was good up till that point."}

{"text":"Just left at 9:30. Got there at 8 ordered apps and drinks which were good; service horrible.  They took forever and messed up the timing of our dinner which came at 9:20 after we complained.  Tables around us got served after we ordered.  We were done with apps at 8:40.   Big fail on communication and coordination wanted something special for birthday and this wasn't it."}
{"text":"The service was really terrible...we had to ask a few times for a few things. 

The restaurant look like it's suppose to be some sort of old club. You really have the awkward feeling if sitting in the middle of a dance floor. Chairs are pilled up in the hallway leading to the washroom. 

The food was not at all worth the price. It was passable at best. I took the balsamic chicken dish. My chicken was overcooked and the balsamic was definitely too present in the dish. I have to say the only star i give to this place was for presentation of the food. 

The worst part of all, was one of the kitchen staff was in the washroom, and did not at all wash his hands after he was done. I did not see him handling the food directly, but saw him walk in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this restaurant very much-from the innovative menu, (butternut squash gnocchi, seared scallops served over bacon mashed potatoes, walleye pike sautéed just right!)  to the good service, (our waiter was very personable and accommodating-not sure of his name, but he said he was originally from Italy). Would definitely go there again and recommend to friends,"}
{"text":"Une endroit sympa avec un service au petits oignons et des prix corrects.
J'y ai pris des cotes levés au Zinfandel qui etait fondante à souhait et la sauce etait vraiment délicieuse. Accompagné de la poutine vargas, qui etait pas mauvaise egalement. L'assiette etait bien copieuse, je recommande vivement"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and there were a handful of other tables with patrons but the restaurant was by no means 'busy'. 

Our server was mostly friendly once we started chatting with him, but it seemed that he was rushing to take our order and plopped the bread basket and food on our table...almost in a careless fashion. 

The white wine was not chilled unfortunately. I did not bother mentioning this after getting that vibe from the server. 

The food itself was mediocre.  We ordered some sushi rolls and chicken teriyaki. The chicken dish had an unusual flavor and had noodles similar to ramen noodles."}
{"text":"I was recommended to Vargas by the Keg who was too full. Just looking for a decent meal after a long day at work. Atmosphere was nice, I sat in the bar area. It went down hill from there. At the recommendation of the waitress I ordered the prime rib with steamed veg and salad. I asked her if it was med rare and she confirmed that it should not be a problem. Out came a plate with a med well cut of prime rib. I figured if it was good, it wasn't a big deal it wasn't med rare. I took one bite and it was just warm and not good at all. I asked for some horse radish thinking it might help and it came but was out of a jar and not fresh at all ie not hot. I was too tired and hungry to send back so I focused on the veg and salad which we're acceptable. I ate half the prime rib. I think the cost d the prime rib was around $30 which is a big disappointment. Why would try serve this terrible piece of meat ie I would have preferred her to tell me there was no med rare available and I would have picked something else. What was also very disappointing was it not hot as well. I also found it surprising the waitress didn't ask a thing when she picked up my half eaten prime rib. Any decent server would have noticed right away and asked if something was wrong and possibly even comp the meal. Anyway I paid and left and will never return. How places like this stay in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"Steak, seafood, appetizers tasted amazing. Really good wine selection and excellent service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I brought in a bachelor party of 10 people and they handled it like pros. Everything is priced really reasonably and the food tasted amazing. None of the 10 men had any complaints with their order. I wouldn't hesitate to come here again."}
{"text":"\"Bar Food with an Upscale Wrapper\". Food was subpar for the price. The wine service was absolutely appalling- waiter brought a second bottle of wine for the group (5 of us), poured for a taste, then poured the remainder of the glass into first glass. Did not serve the females first either. There are so many great food destinations in Montreal that this place should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"Depuis les quelques fois que je vais à ce restaurant, j'y ai développé un truc. Pour les petits appétits, partagez donc la table d'hôte. Les portions y sont énormes!

Cette fois-ci, j'ai choisi les tortellini au veau servi avec un morceau de pork belly et sauce bordelaise. Le morceau de porc était beaucoup trop gras, mais le reste était parfait. Un beau changement des tortellini sauce rosée! Une crème de tomate complétait la table d'hôte en entrée. Celle-ci était assez épaisse. Prenez la salade si jamais vous hésitez.

Les burgers y sont toujours bons et les salades aussi. 

L'endroit est joli et le service est parfois rapide, parfois lent. Allez-y si vous n'êtes pas pressés. Les prix sont relativement chers, sauf si vous séparez une assiette."}

On y va pour le service rapide et discret.
Un cadre assez neutre et une nourriture qu'il est tout autant.
Idéalement placé, il rassemble le midi une clientèle d'affaires en provenance du quartier de la PVM et des environs.
Excellent rapport qualité prix.
J'y retourne régulièrement car c'est un bon endroit pour des rencontres d'affaires sans se faire assommer niveaux prix."}
{"text":"I recently tried Vargas after passing it several times between my hotel and the convention center. After getting out of the conference late one night, I stopped in here with my mom. At first I was worried about being underdressed (in just a top and jeans) but once I saw how the person at the front desk was dressed, I felt fine. I ordered the lobster and crab patties ($17) and garlic mashed potatoes ($6) that were fluffy and the perfect amount of garlic. Another night, I ordered six seared scallops ($35) and for dessert shared a chocolate lava cake. All the food was delicious, if a little overpriced. Definitely order a side or appetizer if you order the seared scallops. Even though the scallops were delicious it just wasn't enough food for dinner. Overall, I like the atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"Amazing! The best French onion soup we had in Montreal. They accept Amex which was also very important. Our server was sweet and helpful! 
The food was delicious! 
The Vargas burger was delicious! 
The restaurant was quiet and we made reservations through open table!"}

{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"\"Uh, sir?  What was that you'd said you wanted in your Martini?\"

\"Vermouth.\"

\"Oh.  Don't get a lot of requests for that.\"

Christ, Jesus.  Wondering why most of my reviews are for places in New York City?  Well, there you go.  If someone knows where I can get a decent 2:1 or 4:1 Martini in Montreal, please PM me.  Finder's fee paid.  First one's on me.  

But I digress.

Americans have been very, very kind to me.  Absurdly kind.  And therefore, when a Montreal-bound American Wet Coast yelper stumbled across my few Montreal reviews and PM-ed me a whole lotta sincere questions about smoked meat and Globe and automatic weapons and local cannibalism indices and poutine, it ended up with us meeting in a downtown steakhouse for a slice of (non-human) protein and a lie-of-the-land chinwag.  Vargas was drawn out of a mutual hat;  close to her hotel, and a redolent meat-smelling place I'd frequently walked past and wondered about.  They won the coin toss.

It's not a *bad* restaurant.  Really.  Let me explain.

Drinks at the bar... Well, young lady, Martinis should have been covered in your basic bartending manual.  I didn't ask for a dry one.  I only tipped you properly because you were courteous enough to *ask*, and because what you finally re-mixed for me was in fact drinkable.

After downing our libations, we asked to be moved to a broad, flat surface, there to ritually devour the Flesh of Animals.  This was accomplished briskly.  Good table, but the room was nearly empty, so we served as window candy.  No problem.  I had a clean shirt on.

We began to peruse the menus.  Mademoiselle turned hers upside-down a few times before wondering aloud what language it was written in.  I called the waiter over, and asked if an English version existed.  Provided in an eyeblink, without a murmur.  Bienvenu a Montréal.

Linguistically sorted, my foreign conspirator opted for a rib-eye.  I defaulted to my \"when you see rack of lamb on a menu, order it\" setting, with an agreement to swap forkfuls.  

\"Potatoes, sir?  Fried, baked, or mash?\"  

\"Fries, please.\"

Ordered a Caesar salad alongside.  Glass of house Shiraz to wash it down. Big, stupid, happy fighting wine.  I'm no sophisticate;  I just like the stuff with coarse red meat.

Their house Shiraz is as sweet as the village idiot.  I wanted to crawl into the glass with a warm muzzy smile.

The Caesar salad was very nice.  Rich dressing, crunchy lettuce, good portion.  A bit above my average expectations for a decent starter salad.

Lamb, ordered medium rare, arrived medium rare.  With a decent, interesting pile of pan-fried vegetables.  And *mashed* potatoes.  Mashed.  Note that I'd ordered fries with that.

The potatoes and vegetables were both around blood temperature.  The lamb was piping hot.  *Everything*on my plate tasted superb, though, temperature notwithstanding.  The lamb's rosemary sauce was thick, rich, tasty, and wholly appropriate.  The vegetables had been seasoned and cauterised by an expert.  And the mashed potatoes, while exactly not what I'd asked for, were too luscious to send back.

I also traded a bit of my sheep for a couple of cubic inches of mademoiselle's steak, and it was wholly as good as anything I'm able to cook on my charcoal barbeque.  These people can handle open flame real well.

Table service was a bit quirky;  our waiter was a character, somewhat, but effortlessly courteous and responsive nonetheless.  He worked for his tip, and his manners and attentiveness almost made up for his and his kitchen's lapses. 

What the place needs to embrace, seriously, is attention to detail.  To wit:  A barkeep who doesn't recognise vermouth (fucksakes!) as a Martini ingredient;  getting mash when I'd ordered fries;  lukewarm potatoes and vegetables served with proper-hot meat.  Didn't ruin the experience, exactly, but it's what I'll remember and talk about.  And write about.  (Oh, look. Duh.)

If you fetch up here?  You'll be treated well, yes.  Nice room.  Very polite staff.   Tasty food. Their cooks do know how to spice a steak and make a sauce. Clean restrooms.  But bring a chalk and slate, because you may need to spell some things out to the front line staff.  Like what a goddamned Martini's made of.  And what a fried potato looks like.  (Hint:  \"Fried\" does not mean \"Hammered Flat\".)

Three stars, mostly for meat, manners, and attitude.  They do appreciate your business.  They just need to figure out how to earn repeat visits.

RTFM, d00ds."}
{"text":"+ two stars for the sheer size and beauty of the space.
- three stars for nearly rude service and overcooked steaks.

Dodged into Vargas during a sudden downpour on a Monday night after work for a quick drink. The bar was already full so sitting at a table was the only option. The server asked at least 4 times if food was going to be ordered. Finally we gave in and ordered since the rain wasn't letting up. 
Food was overcooked, staff bad mouthed each other in clear earshot of customers, bathrooms were cluttered with extra dining room chairs. 
You get the feeling this place used to be something special but now it's just big and can't remember what it's like to be someone's favorite restaurant. Sad."}
{"text":"Happened to be staying right around the corner at the hotel bonaventure for a few days.  Took a walk to find somewhere to eat and stumbled upon this place.  I was amazed at the quality of food and beer for such a reasonable price.  Atmosphere was great.  I got the dumplings as an appetizer and had the beef teriyaki as a meal.  Dumplings were excellent (made with shrimp as opposed to the usual pork).  The beef teriyaki dish was made with filet mignon, with mixed vegetables over chow mein noodles.  For $20 (Canadian) I though the dish was a steal.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a steal/sushi hybrid (disclaimer:  I did not try the sushi so I cannot vouch for it)."}
{"text":"Endroit parfait pour un diner d'affaires. Le service est impeccable, courtois, rapide. Le saumon est délicieux. Des assiettes généreuses et peu coûteuses. Que des bons mots."}
{"text":"It took me so long to finally try Vargas

Being a block away from The Keg, I never bothered with any other steakhouses.

This place seemed a bit stuffy and business.

The service is top notch, the food very well executed and the prices are not as insane as one might think.

I had the filet mignon with scallops and it was pretty good.

Only downside, I upgraded to a side poutine and it came with melted mozzarella cheese!

They do have a terrace in our short summer, it's overlooking a busy street, but it'll do."}
{"text":"We were treated ridiculously poorly by the manager of this place.  We travelled 14 hours by train from New York and arrived in Montreal at ten at night.  We want online to find a place open to  eat.  Their online reservation said they were open until 11, and we made a  10:45 reservation.  We took a cab and arrived at 10:30.  The manager told us they had just closed the kitchen and would not honor our reservation.  He was very rude, unapologetic, and could care less that we had a reservation.  We have never been to Montreal before and this guy definitely made us feel like Montreal is not a friendly place.  If the owner reads this, I highly recommend firing your manager and replacing him with a decent human being."}
{"text":"Best beef I've ever had! I get the filet well done....often it's dry, or butterflied. Ugh! But not at Vargas. It was supreme! Well-seasoned, tender, amazingly flavorful, and chose the mushroom sauce. Lovely! My husband got the signature prime rib (smaller portion), which he enjoyed. The sides - mushrooms, grilled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes- were great accompaniments. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I ate in the bar one night where there is a full menu. The food is OK, but a tad pricey for the quality. The staff was pretty nice and the dessert was scrumptuous."}
{"text":"I went to Vargas while I was in Montreal for a conference. What a fun sushi experience to have with a few friends.

Two words. Pizza. Sushi. You may think that putting them together sounds gross, but consider that the crust is tempura batter, a mixture of different kinds of fish mixed with spicy sauce, and tobiko on top. It was delicious, and extremely unique.

Everything else was high quality. If I ever find myself back in Montreal I will make a point of going to Vargas again!"}
{"text":"Idéalement situé pour les gens qui travaillent dans le quartier
On y allait souvent entre collègues, pour se retrouver, célébrer une fête ou organiser un déjeuner de départ
Le burger du mois est toujours délicieux, et les frites aussi
Je prenais souvent la pizza sushi aussi qui est très bonne, mais seul petit hic, quand j'ai demandé un peu plus de sauce pour la pizza sushi, le serveur m'a répondu qu'elle coûtait cher et qu'il allait me charger pour un peu de sauce en plus... pas très fin j'ai trouvé, surtout me disant ça devant tous mes collègues...
A part ça, super, grand choix de plats et bon service"}
{"text":"My wonderful personal Yelp guide to Montreal, Mister O., and I met to try out Vargas on a cool evening last week--perfect weather for a carnivorous foray into one of the city's premiere steakhouses.

We arrived a bit early for our reservation, so decided to indulge in a drink at the bar. All beautifully polished wood, the bar (and restaurant itself) was quite large and the bartender, friendly. Unfortunately, she seemed not to be terribly familiar with how to prepare his martini or my lemondrop martini, which came out a bit frothy and not nearly citrusy enough for my taste. Still, my companion and I enjoyed sitting at the bar, chatting about hockey, and stealing glances at the NHL game on the bar TV.

When we were ready to be seated, we were led through the grand dining room to a table near the window. As I read through the menu, I realized there wasn't any sushi. I know, not odd for a steakhouse--except for one that touts having a sushi chef, as I'd read about Vargas in several places. In fact, the only sushi I saw was a roll on the appetizer menu.

Regardless, I was more than happy enough to stick with steak. After deliberating between the rack of lamb and rib steak, we decided to order both and share, with me selecting the Montreal-spiced rib eye. Both entrees came with a choice of potato (baked, twice baked, fries, Yukon gold mashed) or seasonal vegetables. Mr. O. went with the vegetables and a side order of fries, while I got the twice-baked potato.

We both started with a Caesar salad, which was surprisingly large for a side salad. The dressing was creamy and cheesy, and quite delicious. When the steak arrived, it seemed to overwhelm the plate, and the twice-baked potato was nearly obliterated by its 17 oz. heft. I had ordered it medium-rare, and to my taste it could have been a bit more rare. As I took my first bite, the Montreal spice (seasoned salt, pepper, various herbs, mustard seeds) hit my tastebuds--a little salty but very good. The shiraz we'd ordered was perfect with the steak, as it was able to hold its own against the spices.

Service was always attentive, but rather amusing. The waiter, for whom English was not his first language though he spoke it impeccably, had a catch-all phrase that he used throughout the meal, \"The worst is over.\" When I placed my order, he said, \"The worst is over,\" and again when he poured my wine, and at various other points of the meal. I had to ask Mr. O. if this was a Canadian phrase and he said it wasn't. But it was charming and funny.

In all, the evening and meal were very pleasant. For Vargas, I give 3 stars. The minuses were the bad martinis and slightly overcooked steak. The flavor of the steak was a definite plus.

If I were reviewing the company alone, I would give 5 stars to the experience of dining with Mister O.--a true raconteur and superb guide to Montreal, without whom I would have missed a lot of wonderful food. Merci!"}
{"text":"Love the food , they have some unique dishes and always something interesting for the special of the day. The roasted prime beef is simply incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, wine and awesome waitress, Terri!

Filet mignon sliders, mushrooms with peppers and goat cheese, Balsamic chicken were worth going back for if not for lack of time."}
{"text":"Disappointing   Service is incredibly slow. Dinner roll texture was as if they had been warned in the microwave. Lobster mashed potatoes super dry... Think the texture of paste!"}
{"text":"I can only give it three stars because I had the filet Mignon and it was okay nothing special however my friend had the tuna with lobster mash potatos and it was awesome."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give negative stars that would be my choice.
Walked in to the establishment with a party of 6.  I recognize we did not have a reservation but is was roughly 7:00pm.  Hostess told us there was nothing available but if we wanted to come back in 20 minutes or call she had a reservation that had not shown up yet and she was going to hold the reservation for 20 minutes.
That is normal and so we asked if there was a bar we could wait at and the reply was \"yes but there are people at the bar\" 
NEVER have I been told anywhere that I can't wait or have a drink at a bar while waiting for a table.  Top that with the fact that the bar is visible from the outside and it had more than half of the chairs unoccupied.
My take is that the establishment is \"selective\" about its patrons which in my world equates to profiling.
Our party was white Caucasian well dressed but not Canadian.  
Their loss on multiple levels.  We went to another restaurant where we were seated, had an excellent meal with excellent service and had a total check of over $700.
To the management of this establishment I say to remember that we live in a digital world where one unsatisfied customer can prevent many other patrons from walking through their door."}
{"text":"I came here for a 25 person group business dinner.  The service was wonderful and the prix fixe menu (the $60) was a good selection for everyone.  I had the lamb shank which was pretty amazing.  Our CEO was very impressed with this place, so he will most likely be coming back.  Pat on the back for me!"}

El sushi no es recomendable.
Los platos de carne tampoco destacan. 
El atún es muy bueno."}

However the quality was very good as well. I order the sushi as my main course and the gyoza as an appetizer. Both were very good. The location inside was very nice as well. When I'm back in Montreal , I wouldn't mind give me this place another shot."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my birthday and was really happy with this decision. (We used the OpenTable app. Beautiful and warm lighting, fancy set-up (casual attire is fine), friendly staff, and tasty food.  I was surprised with bday cheesecake at the end of our meal which was a nice touch.  My husband and I plan on returning for sure."}
{"text":"Great location for a business meal. I like the fact that they have good steaks and sushi :-)"}
{"text":"I attended a business lunch here. Had the roast beef. It was really good and easy to cut. My only complain was that at our table, the portion sizes for the cuts were not the same. Some people felt cheated out of a meal."}
{"text":"It was getting late and we really needed to eat before going back to the hotel. We were walking and found Vargas. We loved it. All of it. It is great.

I had never been to a place that has a full steakhouse menu and some of the best sushi you will ever have, I was in heaven. 

We decided to share food. The Prime Rib was perfect and we ordered mashed to go with it and oh my God. It was wonderful. We also ordered various sushi and a sushi sandwich. Okay, we spent a lot of money, but it was so great and there was not one thing we did not love.

Their wine list is extensive and the server will help you out. She/he will also tell you what is the freshest fish to have and what is just great. The service is great and you can linger if you want.

The place is spotless, it is beautiful and you will love it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, sat at the bar both times. Last night was the NBA Finals. Last time was the Canadiens. Both bartendresses were very nice. Had sushi both times, surprisingly good. The apple crumble was also good. Not the cheapest place, not the most expensive. With all the madness going on because of Grand Prix events, it was a nice quiet place to get away."}
{"text":"Environment is pleasant and rather typical of any western restaurant in the city. Rather conducive for business lunches. 

Service was brisk but the waiter who served us was unsmiling and a bit on the brusque side... can't say we felt most welcomed. 

Duck confit was delicious though."}
{"text":"In Montreal for a Bachelor party and walking away from the Hell that is the Time Supper Club. Devastated that our fabulous weekend had just been completely ruined in the span of 30 minutes, we trudged dejectedly back to our hotel. We had thrown in the towel, we were done, we were ready to go to bed, to end our weekend right then. 

However God was smiling down on us this night. As we walked my dad glanced to his left and noticed Vargas. \"Hey guys I read this morning that, that place is a pretty good steakhouse\". Having not eaten we decided to give it a shot, what did we have to loose? 

Walking up to the door we could smell the steak in the air. Pulling the door a wonderful sound washed over us, after the godawful pounding Techno music at Time SC, could it really be? ... it was Old Blue Eyes crooning from the speakers. Never before or since have I been happier to hear Sinatra. Looking at my best friends I simply muttered \"I think we're gonna be OK here.\" I didn't know at that moment but I've never been more right. 

We were seated almost immediately, moments later we had bottles of wine of the table. We ordered appetizers, the calamari & the stuffed portabella mushrooms, absolutely fabulous! 

Now for the main course, Porterhouse, all around. Outside of Peter Luger's it was the best steak I've ever had. Barclay Prime, Del Frisco's, Ruths Chris, Morton's, The Palm, they can all take a back seat to this steak from Vargas. 

Perfectly seasoned with a Montreal Style steak spice. It had been grilled to a perfect medium. I savoured every bite. I probably would've eaten the plate. It was that good. 

In conclusion Vargas single handedly saved one of the greatest weekends we've ever had together from ending on a terrible note. If that's not worth 5 stars then nothing is. In fact I give it 6."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, decor, staff and of course, the food.

Recommend the Vargas Salad, Sushi Pizza and the Flank Steak.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Rivals some of the better LA sushi establishments - and they serve steak! Prices were reasonable and the selection for both sushi and entrees was great. My only gripe was that they did not offer more sake choices - only two kinds are on the menu and neither are unfiltered (the most flavorful IMO). 

Great service - but we went on a Sunday night and it wasn't at all busy - a pleasant surprise considering how many great reviews the place has. Excellent.

One last note - the food - quality & portion - sushi pieces are bite sized (like authentic japanese sushi should be) so if you're expecting huge pieces of fish you'll want to go elsewhere - and the wife raved about her steak, which was cooked perfectly. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant in the heart of downtown Montreal with a beautiful setup. We got there around 9h30 pm & the kitchen was still open! The staff was very friendly as well. We ordered our plates & didn't wait too long; I ordered ribs which came with a poutine plate. The Ribs were rubberry, but the poutine was good, although I had to ask for more sauce. The steak dans son jus was perfectly cooked. The lamb was alright but nothing to wow me. Now the Grilled Octopus was a real disappointment! Not only did it have a strong fish taste but it was very rubbery as well. I've been to Vargas before & I do recall that the food was better. The highlight of the evening was the meeting of the Cabral family (house of Porto & wine in Portugal) who were dining as well & sent us glasses of Porto. We chatted with them & left with a promise to meet them again next year at La grande dégustation des vins du monde!"}
{"text":"Not an exciting restaurant, but since it wasn't crowded on a Tuesday night, it worked very well for a dinner with customers. I had the sushi dinner, which wasn't terrible, but really nothing to write about. The three courses were miso soup, sashimi shooters, and a platter of Sushi/nigiri combo."}
{"text":"Went for a quick work lunch with two colleagues. Ideal since we managed to get seated, order, eat and pay in 40 minutes. Service was really good and the lunch menu is affordable. I had the côte de boeuf which was alright, lacked accompaniments except a small bowl of vegetables.
This place is good for business and work lunches if you work in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's day a couple years ago with the BF and it was just okay. Paid a pretty penny for some not-so-awesome food, including a completely raw rib-eye that came to the table despite the clear \"medium-rare\" order specification. The thing was not browned AT ALL and actually had blood pooled atop the steak. A little weird that it managed to leave the kitchen, especially since this was NOT the request. Is this place really a steakhouse?

I had roasted duck atop a bed of homemade pappardelle tossed in braising liquid. It was heavy, monochromatic and oversalted. Gross.
Service was inattentive."}
{"text":"I travel and dine out quite frequently, this was a fantastic experience. Outstanding ambience and personal service. Easily the best prime rib I've ever had. Incredible crusted pepper, very lean...Given that this is prime rib. An incredible portion. Flavor was incredible! The Sides could use a little work. Rather small and each side is not meant to really be shared.  My wife had the fillet mignon and it was delectable! We shared a bottle of red Chianti wine which was also delicious and fairly priced.   

Finished with the volcanic chocolate lava cake and it was also phenomenal! As this was an anniversary dinner, we couldn't have been happier with the way it all turned out. Thanks for the wonderful service."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Won't come back.  Came for a bachelor party.  

Place was empty on a Saturday night.  I don't even remember what I ate - I think some sort of beef."}
{"text":"Came here in a summer Saturday night in the city, was surprised that it was pretty empty considering I had heard good things. Service was prompt, but we had told our server our plan was to have a few drinks, order appetizers, then sushi, then a main course but was going to take our time doing so. He seemed persistent in coming over several times to try to take our main course meal despite the fact we mentioned we were no where close to wanting to order. Ordered calamari for appetizer which was pretty dry, mixed rolls of sushi (which were great), and chicken teriyaki (which was good with the exception of the lo mein noodles they used). Overall i  would recommend."}
{"text":"Try the lost paradise if you like seafood - fantastic!!! Loved it :) never had anything like it..some kind of sushi fusion I think. also had some chocolate lava cake thing with chocolate ice cream - amazing!! Staff were also excellent."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant steakhouse/fruits de mers, belle ambiance, bon service, bonnes portions, goûteux et excellents, abordable pour ce genre de resto, idéal pour un rendez-vous d'affaires ou galant."}
{"text":"The Food was hit or miss. The service was not great . We had hard time getting our drinks refilled. the steaks were not cooked like we ordered. But were tender. The soup was hot and had good flavor. Over all I would not rush back here. There are many other places to try."}
{"text":"Sushi was surprisingly better than I had expected. My cousins got the steak with Mac and cheese that was to die for! 

Really good wine list and excellent service!"}
