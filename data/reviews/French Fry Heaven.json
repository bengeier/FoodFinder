{"text":"Small portion sizes, random closings of the store, soggy fries, and disgruntled employees complaining to me about new ownership ruined this place for me. $5 gets you half of a small box of fries that taste quick and cheap. The atmosphere inside isn't great either, with no music and a small space making customers crowd in"}
{"text":"I've been eating French Fry Heaven all over Florida and I see now I'll get a chance to get me some when I visit my office in Tempe (another reason to love my job). Gotta start thinking of what I'll be getting....Pulled pork spuds with jalapenos if I'm real hungry or Garlic Parm fries with Pink Himalaya salt if I'm just jonesing for some tasty frites. mmmm. Coming out there (not) soon (enough)!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh the loaded spuds are the way to go.  Poutine or Buff chicken so far. Go hungry"}
{"text":"Amazing, huge portions for a great price. The buffalo ranch chicken fries are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food. The fries were super soggy and didn't taste like anything and the chicken was just gross and bad. If french fries are what you are after you would have better luck literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Score is soley based of hours. Came at 7:30pm of move-in weekend. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It sounded great, it was not.  The guys behind the counter were great!  But the fries were tasteless. I was really hoping for Great Taters.  
Oh, and parking?  On the street... Tempe street parking is only for the irresponsible or newly rich.."}
{"text":"A must stop when in Tempe!  The loaded spuds are fantastic but the sweet potato fries can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the chicken wings and fries combo? My friends and I love our usual B-Dubs spot, but we wanted to try something different and we came across this place. The pictures looked so appetizing that we had to go. 

We went around 9pm on a Saturday and there was no customers besides us. I give this place 3 stars because the employees didn't look friendly at all and didn't even greet us when we walked in. I asked what their most popular item was and the cashier didn't seem interested. I ordered the buffalo chicken and was expecting the buffalo chicken to be extremely spicy. My experience would have been better if the staff was more approachable and if there was more spice in the buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"French fry heaven is really good especially the buffalo fries and sunrise fries is a must try, though it is a little pricey but it's good to spend a bit more when you're super hungry and you wanna eat food that makes you happy :)"}
{"text":"Heathy?  Not in the slightest!  Delicious enough to justify it?  You bet!  The Buffalo chicken fries cured my late night fried food cravings with a quickness!  The Buffalo sauce has just the right kick, and the ranch is awesome to top it off!  I think it's a little pricey, however they do give you a descent portion.  Can't wait to try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Guys who work there are super helpful and the food was pretty good for 8$
 loved the music"}
{"text":"Don't get my wrong, I used to LOVE this place. Fries were amazing and you had so many options for unquie toppings. Their strawberrry lemondade is the best I've ever tasted. These past few times I ventured there, their quality was just really subpar. The fries were undercooked and super squishy which just made my usual Chicken Garlic Parama unappealing. The last time I went, I actually got food poisioning. I really hope they improve soon because it makes me sad such an awesome place is going downhill."}
{"text":"Came here looking for poutine. Not the best I've had, but the fries were quite good. The cheese was all wrong, however."}
{"text":"First off- great concept and location. However, tonight was my first time eating food from here sober and I was very surprised at the poor quality and service. Worst chicken tenders I have ever had in my life!! Do not get the chicken tenders they taste like freeze dried pencils! I have never seen or tasted anything so awful! Go to McDonalds instead! Or even better, Taco Bell! They will be cheaper and more satisfying. If I was too drunk and got these I would cry real tears and not even those could make these chicken tenders less dry. 
P.S. 2 stars cuz the sauces are good tho and the fries are decent just kinda soggy"}
{"text":"We were invited last night to help in preparation of their opening.  The pulled pork fries are amazing.  We also got the chicken garlic parmesan fries are they were also fantastic.  The restaurant is in a great location and I'm confident that it will do really well.  We're looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I literally bought this 30 mins ago and found hair in my fries (see photo.)

I like soggy fries, but boyfriend doesn't. These fries are soggy and in my opinion taste fine EXCEPT FOR THE HAIR I FOUND LOL. 

Not worth the $9 but I get that they are probably popular because of the following two reasons:

1. Prime location near ASU!
2. They're open late.

Kinda sad and grossed out about the hair because I really wanted this place to be good..."}
{"text":"Fries are soggy and chicken is burnt. Gonna be a No from me, dawg. They tried to update it a few months ago but still the same. Employees picked my fries and chicken with their bare hands then touched the register / cash. Needs to be replaced with an on Campus Starbucks!"}
{"text":"This place is alright for a late-night bite. It is clear from the name that their main entree will have or be fries. But, the quality of the food is not necessarily the best. I feel like you are better off getting chicken tenders and fries some place else. The serving sizes are huge, so the pricing makes sense. I just wished that they cooked their food better."}
{"text":"I mean, you truly can't go wrong with this place. It's French fries with stuff on top. Nonetheless, here are my thoughts: 
I had the garlic Parmesan chicken. It's basically a garlic cream sauce, breaded chicken chunks, and tons of Parmesan cheese. The garlic is strong. If you \"kinda\" like garlic, stay away. If you're on a first date, pass. But if you like garlic and couldn't care less than people ten feet away can smell your breath, dig in! Definitely tasty, a large serving, and fast service!"}
{"text":"They need to fix the sign above the door.it says they close at midnight, so we showed up at 11 to find clothes. The online hours and then store hours conflict with each other. Very frustrating when nothing else is open. 

They are lucky their food is so good."}
{"text":"I love this place to death, however, I've come here 4 times this week to try to get food. Every single time it says it's open, and it's not. I will come between the hours of 12-5. I've also come after work when I get off around 11-11:30 and they turn off all the fryers early and close down and lock up. I've had them turn me down at 11:30 because they weren't taking any more people...there was maybe 6 people in there. What's up with that? Don't say it's open if it's not. This has been consistent ever since they opened my freshman year (3 years now)."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday evening, and was pretty excited to try this place that specializes in French fries. The good thing about this place was that their service was fast, however that was probably the only good thing about this place. Tried the garlic parmesan chicken fries, and they took a bunch of precooked fries and served with a topping of cheese, sauces and chicken. however the fries were too soggy and over cooked for my taste. I wasn't sure initially if that's how they were supposed to be and I complained to the counter lady that they don't feel very fresh, and she said that they \"just made them\". The next time I feel like eating fries, I would probably just get standard fries from McDonalds down the road."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place, as I'm kind of a potato fiend, but I can't say I was thrilled with my experience.  Nothing against the place, I mean it's a small food shop on a college campus.  I suppose this is what I should expect having so many dietary restrictions.  Can't say I'd choose to eat here again, but if you don't need to worry about animal products in your food you'd  probabaly enjoy it.  My husband seemed to anyway."}
{"text":"Was looking for somewhere to get a baked potato and found this place. Surprisingly good! They have a ton of different toppings you can add to your potato(or fries). They also have recommended combinations of toppings, but I just chose all my toppings separately which they were totally cool with. I'd go here again when craving another baked potato!"}
{"text":"If you love fried potatoes and cheese then this is the place for you! I always determine a place has great food if it taste just as good the next day heated up. I know cold fries don't sound great the next day but if you throw your leftovers (and you WILL have leftovers...so much food) in the oven it taste just as great as when you originally ordered it! Also the service was fantastic; the girl assisting us helped us through the menu and gave us recommendations based off what we like. I got the parmesan chicken fry and it was just as good as she described. Service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Best quick bite around! Smothered spuds are the way to go! Great change of pace, totaly filling, toppings you don't get anywhere else and taste AWESOME! Go with the Shepherd's Pie - can't be beat! But, if you must go traditional, chicken tenders are great too!"}
{"text":"Fries of my dreams! I was mildly hungover and wanted some deliciousness, so I came here. It was delicious. I got the Buffalo and garlic parm chicken fries and they were excellent. Smothered in sauce and cheese, fried chicken and good fries - it was absolutely everything I wanted! Definite amazing place if you like fries, chicken, cheese and sauces. So many options though, good luck choosing just one!"}
{"text":"Stopped by because poutine was on the menu. Just 3 parts to poutine: fries, gravy, cheese curds. Fries were okay. Gravy was okay. Cheese curds were disappointing, not fresh. They didn't squeak like fresh ones. (I'd compare this situation to sipping a soda, expecting it to be fresh and bubbly, but instead finding that it's flat. Might still drink it if you're thirsty, but blerg!) If cheese curds don't squeak when you chew them, then they're just...well...REGULAR chunks of cheese. Lol. Might as well just call it fries with gravy and mozzarella.

My friend liked her \"baked tater\" topped fries. Portions were decent for price. If I were to go again, I'd order something other than poutine.

Bottom line: No fresh, squeaky cheese curds in poutine = disappointment."}
{"text":"great selection of delicious boxes of fries, and made really quickly! kind of expensive but definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"Full disclaimer I'm a \"Mom\" of an 18yo that said, you're getting the older crowd review here. Fries were as advertised quite delicious had the Buffalo spicy messy yummy! However environment was loud (think club) and uhh vulgar rap dropping the \"N\" word f bombs ass and titties would be my son's description of music that was playing.  Not sure the volume combined with  the lyrics made it worse or not hearing what ppl with me were saying?!  Either way this was a hipster experience for French fries, felt totally out of place given the area they put their restaurant in. Still happy we tried this joint probably wouldn't take kiddos here under age 13 solely based on music and noise level it was played."}
{"text":"I thought this place had great customer service as this was my first time there and The lady helped me with the menu. She gets 5 stars. For the food, to me the fries are a little thin and get super soggy for my liking. The flavor was there just a texture issue for me. I could see why other people like this concept. I am just a crispy fry girl."}
{"text":"Just had some fries with their signature cheese and sour cream.  Oh Em Gee...that's all I gotta say!  Topped it off with a Reese's shake that hit the spot!  I need a nap now, but I will sleeping with a full tummy and a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Mind blown! I got the pulled pork and they were incredible. Completely loaded with pork and cheese! Wish my trip here was longer so I could try them all!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming back and the food still hit the spot! I had the bruschetta fries this time and it filled me up for the rest of the day. Last time I had the garlic parm which was amazing but the bruschetta really hit the spot. Definitely one of my favorite AZ food places!"}
{"text":"Fries with anything you want in top? That's what I'm talking about! Love this place. Workers are always cheerful and give great service. Sanitary conditions are also up to date"}
{"text":"I think its a little on the pricey side for potatoes.  I had the garlic chicken parmesan fries, and was a little dissapointed. The food wasn't spectacular, it was rather plain and some fries were burnt. I feel like I could of made it better in my college dorm lol. Will possibly try the buffalo fries another time, however I can probably make it better or exactly the same with some frozen chicken tenders, ore ida fries, some franks red hot and ranch."}
{"text":"My first meal as a 21 year old after a fun night of dancing and drinks. My friend recommended the Chicken Parmesan fries, and it smelled and looked glorious! When you are inebriated, you definitely want something filling to hold you down. You definitely get a great mound of food for the price. The french fries were fresh, the chicken was crispy, and the cheese was oozy to perfection. I do wish it had some tomato element to go along with the fries. A major problem I had was every bite I took felt like I was lapping the ocean. It was so dang salty! I couldn't finish it, so I brought it back home. It held up pretty well cold, but I definitely recommend eating it as soon as possible.
Overall, it's a decent place to grab some quick, greasy grub after a long night of clubbing. Just make sure you ask for light salt."}
{"text":"Quality has really gone down recently. The chicken feels like rubber, and I had like a chicken strip's worth of it. For $9, I feel ripped off. I have half the amount of food I was getting before, as well."}
{"text":"I'm very sad to say that I was really disappointed in the quality of the food here. I have visited Mesa, Arizona a few times and noticed this place and was excited to try them out as my favorite side dish are\"fries\" yum! Yesterday my family and I decided to order from here I got the chicken fried chicken fries and a side of chicken tenders.  My review may be bad because of the hype I built before eating here but their fries and flavor of food was very bland and mediocre. Fries were soft and mushy, and the chicken strips were more better than chicken. This was not French Fry Heaven for me sorry."}
{"text":"The owners of this location was recently changed. I am excited about this change in management, as they expressed new cooking best practices and enthusiasm about their business. In the past, their oil has been burnt and food overcooked, which yielded low-quality food at high prices. They would benefit from using their food truck more often for events around campus and negotiating with Aramark at ASU to accept student M&G, which would be a mutually beneficial adoption for both the institution and French Fry Heaven."}
{"text":"I AM A REGULAR HERE. love their food. fantastic. the employees used to be better they're kinda rude and jerks now. i went tonight (wednesday 5/9/18) and they were closed at 9:34 when both the sign and online says 12. they had nothing posted on the door or in the window. again, GREAT AMAZING FOOD, CRAPPY EMPLOYEES AND SERVICE"}
{"text":"I frequented French Fry Heaven my freshman year at ASU.  I have recently noticed that they have downsized their fries and kept the same price.  I enjoy their buffalo chicken spud, but I no longer feel that I am getting what I am paying for.  I suppose someone who has recently discovered this place would have a different opinion, but the smaller fries/same price thing kind of ruined FFH for me."}
{"text":"Like the idea... but just couldnt be delivered... fries werent even good themselves... found it really hard to eat them with the toppings when the fries had no taste"}
{"text":"The bf and I decided to have dinner feast of French fries. Who doesn't love French fries?

The bf got the Chicken Garlic Parmesan and I got the Buffalo Chicken loaded spud. I had originally wanted to get the Chicken Garlic Parmesan but that is was the bf was going to get and I wanted to at least try two different items so I went with the Buffalo Chicken in hopes that the bf would share his. 

The Buffalo Chicken was okay. It got really spicy after a few bites. Needed more ranch sauce to cool down the spiciness. The few bites the bf allowed me to taste of his were pretty awesome and I had wished we had just gotten double orders of the Chicken Garlic Parmesan. The bf was able to kill off his entire order of fries, me on the other hand got about a quarter of the way and quit due to the amount of sweat I was producing. I should have gotten a side of ranch..

Pricing is $8.49 for loaded spuds one size with a pretty generous portion of food. They also have tater tot options small $2.39 and regular $3.99 add ons and dips cost a dollar or so more. 

The one thing I didn't try but wish I had was the only dessert they have on their menu- Funnel fries. They looked delicious.  

Definite plus is that this place is open till 1 am. In the ASU area and they offer discounts to ASU students. When we went is was a Friday night at 10pm. It wasn't super busy in the complex and restaurant but there were quite a few people there and walking around. There is paid parking right next to the restaurant on the east side."}
{"text":"The order I've just received through grub hub looked gross. The fries and meat were burnt on both orders,you could smell how burnt they were.It shouldnt of been made and or sent out.I had to trashed it.what a waste of food time and money.I got refund so I'm satisfied.Im just really disappointed with this restaurant.Ive ordered from here before the food was pretty good.which is why I'm dissatisfied  tonight."}
{"text":"This place is awesome -- I only wish that it had been there during my college years (or maybe not!) If you don't know the concept, it's basically taking poutine to a whole new level! Fresh cut French fries topped with your choice of toppings, which are all made in house. I was suspicious of the \"made fresh in house\" claim, especially the slow roasted pulled pork. But when I talked to the owner, he described how they do it all! 

I tried the pulled pork and jalapeño fries and the pork was super moist with lots of flavor! And the dessert fries were a perfect ending. Light and airy (like mini churros) with a side of icing -- yum!  I want to try the chicken tenders and country gravy fries next! Gotta be better than the concoction I used to get at Denny's! Or any of the baked potatoes (for a healthier option- ha!) 

Parking in Tempe can be a pain but there is a lot adjacent to the plaza for $1 per hour. Not bad and actually convenient. 

I highly recommend this place for late night or casual lunch.  You can have a salad the next day..."}
{"text":"Their fries are always soggy because of the toppings and they're not even good fries. I would much prefer to just go to McDonald's and grab some for way cheaper."}
{"text":"The workers at the front are very unwelcoming and just stared at me when I walked in trying to order. The people at the counter were on their phones and eating. YES, they were EATING WHILE COOKING THE FOOD IN FRONT OF ME. Super not a fan"}
{"text":"Went here after a long night. All I have to say is get the garlic Parmesan chicken fries conglomerate
Do it 
Do it
Do it
Do it 
Do it"}
{"text":"OMG this is the best place on earth. I literally never thought fries could be this good, but they are A M A Z I N G. Some of the most delicious things my mouth has ever had the pleasure of tasting."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the last couple of years. The food is pretty consistently good. I'm a vegetarian and I get the bruschetta - I'm glad they have a vegetarian option, and I also like that it's not quite so greasy and heavy as some of the meat options. The restaurant is clean and new inside, and there are about 10 bar-style seats inside as well as a lot of outdoor seating. 
But my three star rating is due to the service I've received here. About half of the employees have been perfectly friendly and generally up to expectation. But the other half have done things such as: not say anything to me when I get to the register to order and just expect me to tell them what I want, throw my receipt away before asking me if I wanted my receipt (I did) and then dig it out of the trash can to give it to me, eat while taking my order and even get my card all greasy with French fry grease from the fries they were eating, and clearly be standing \"hiding\" behind the drink machine on their phone while another employee was left to take care of everything. All of this is quite regrettable in terms of customer service and I hope the management can do a better job in this realm. 
Sidenote: the food timer/alarm they have is incredibly loud to the point that it's just unnecessary."}
{"text":"If the food was good or the service was better it would rate more stars but both are lacking. Was greeted with a disinterested stare from the counter folks, which I get to a degree. You're probably in college busting your ass on your education and working a crappy job to pay the bills. I feel your pain but I don't expect to literally feel it with poor service. Pretend to try and do your job if you can't muster up enough to actually do it. 

As for the food, mediocre would be a compliment. The fries, gravy and cheese all taste like they came from the grocery store. If any of it was in any way fresh I'll eat my shoes. I imagine this place only continues to exist because it's walking distance for a lot of the college students and it's supposedly open late. I imagine the food seems better at the end of a night of drinking and having fun but if you actually want decent food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So a few friends and I found this place on yelp a few weeks ago and did not get the chance to come until this past Wednesday. The idea of it alone was enough to get us all to make a trip from Litchfield Park all the way to Tempe. After fighting through traffic for an hour and navigating the ASU area to find some parking (which we had to pay for), we FINALLY make it to French Fry Heaven! We were all extremely excited. The place is small, but it's very clean, modern, and nice. The staff was friendly and helpful, answering any questions we had.

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger fries, my friends got the Italian, and the buffalo chicken. The wait wasn't too long, and when we got the food it looked delicious, of course we all had to take pictures for instagram and snapchat before digging in.

Upon taking my first bite, my excitement quickly faded. While the toppings were good... the fries were horrible. Probably the worst fries I have ever had. They were all dark brown and tasted burnt. Obviously they were in the fryer far too long. I tried to power through, but then I realized another thing, there was no bacon in my \"bacon\" cheeseburger fries!

I finished about half of it before giving up trying to eat something I didn't like. It is RARE for me to not finish my food, especially when it involves cheeseburgers and fries.

I had a few bites of my friends fries too, while the toppings were good on theirs as well, we all agreed that the fries were all burnt, leaving us all in complete disappointment. How can you specialize in fries and mess it up? That should be the one thing that will always be good, it's seriously not that hard to make good french fries.

I had high expectations for this place, I am seriously disappointed. I wish it was as good as I had imagined, only giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the cute girl working the register, she was really nice."}
{"text":"Place is not taken care of. Trash is overflowing. Boxes of supplies stacked next to seating areas. 
They charge you for water cups without telling you. Charge you for sides of ranch without telling you.
Food is ok."}
{"text":"If the music is too loud and obnoxious for someone like myself, then that says a lot given my tolerance for such. The food was ookaaayyyy. It's really hard to mess up a pile of fries that you load with delicious things, like cheese sauce.....and yet, it was underwhelming. I got the BBQ pulled pork fries- the BBQ sauce being on the sweeter side and the sliced jalapeños were more of hunks of jalapeños. Still relatively good. It just had so much potential and left some to be desired."}
{"text":"When I heard about this place, I was eager to try the poutine, but now having tried it I am disappointed. 

$8 + tax for a poutine...which is potato, gravy, and cheese.  For the portion and quality, drop the price to $5 and maybe it will be worthwhile.

The only good part were the cheese curds.  The fries were a little burnt and the portion for the price was small.  The gravy was fine."}
{"text":"Small place on Apache West of Rural Road with a great location for ASU students. 

Not much seating inside but ample outside and good to take out.

First time here and a good selection of different variety of Poutine. 

Shared the Taco Poutine and Chicken Parmesan Poutine. The Taco Poutine had a good mix of taco meat, avocado, lettuce and cheese which mixed well of top of the french fries.  The Parmesan Chicken wad on the bit cheesy for me.

There is a drink fountain along with lemonade and strawberry lemonade dispenser which I had the strawberry lemonade which was pretty good. 

The service was okay but on the slow side considering we ordered with no one in front of us.

Have to say the portions are pretty good size and could not finish the meal.

Will be back to try some of the other Poutine"}
{"text":"Now hear this... Now hear this... \"Heaven is a place on Earth.\"  \"Heaven is a Wonderful Place\" full of fried potatoes with an interesting name like, Poutine, Putin or pootin, depending on what happens in the gastrointestinal area.. but never mind that... lets get back to this \"Postcard from Heaven\" review because reading this puts you \"Just A Step From Heaven\".  

I stopped in here one glutinous evening and took the \"Stairway to Heaven\".  I ordered the buffalo wings and loaded fries.  It was like experiencing \"Heaven Tonight\" right there in my mouth.  The salty goodness of a french fry, topped with the vinegar and heat of the buffalo sauced chicken.  The beauty of this is that there can be \"Heaven for Everybody\"  \"As Heaven is Wide\" and plentiful right there on the campus of ASU.  You will find a plethora of toppings for your fries like hot wings sauce, gravy, blue cheese and sour cream.

When you go, don't expect to have a leisurely dinner or lunch.  This is a place that is stop and go.  Seating is limited.  

Ladies and Gentlemen of Yelp, \"I Found Heaven\" and I intend to keep \"Knocking on Heaven's\" door every time I need a french fry fix.
