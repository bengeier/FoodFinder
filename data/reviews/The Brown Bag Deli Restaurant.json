{"text":"While I dislike the fact that my job keeps me on the road every morning, I consider myself lucky to get to pick up lunch at the Brown Bag on a regular basis. The place and its staff are charming and inviting, and the food -- soups, sandwiches, salads, cookies & pies -- is always fresh and delicious. The homemade bisques are especially good, as is anything made with the turkeys that are roasted in-house. And the pies are to die for.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while driving through Monticello due to the rave reviews. Thankfully, it lived up to the hype. Good portions for a great price, and the staff could not be any friendlier. Definitely check out their daily specials (as well as soup of the day)"}
{"text":"Looks like I'm going to be the first one to leave an average review.  Everyone in Monticello raves about this place.  And I don't really see why to be honest.  The food is average and overpriced.  It serves primarily sandwiches that are pretty ordinary.  You'll pay $8-12 for sandwich, side, and drink.  If you want pie, add on another few bucks.    I think it may be the ambience that draws people.  It is right off the square in Monticello and definitely has a unique, homey 'feel.' Middle-aged women seem to flock to this place.  So maybe I'm just their wrong clientele.  If you're a guy with a good appetite you'll do better heading to 3 Ravens or The Pub.  If you're a woman who loves ambience and sandwiches, you've found your place."}
{"text":"simple old fashion small town sandwich shop. yummy sandwiches, nice simple bread and awesome desserts."}
{"text":"We were in town for railroad days at the museum and took the train into the downtown area.We wanted to eat lightly but not any fast food.My girlfriend found the brown bag deli as i was looking somewhere else. We went in and i ordered there monster nachos and my girl got a bean burrito. The nachos was loaded with meat & cheese and it was big.My girlfriend liked the burrito and said it hit the spot. This was more of a deli style place and they had lots of homemade sandwiches on there menu.My girlfriend really like there pies also and they had quite a variety in the case.If your looking for a real good lunch while your in the downtown area this is the place."}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife grew up here, and once a year we make a pilgrimage back to this town surrounded by an ocean of corn.   And at LEAST once a year I make sure lunch means a sandwich at the Brown Bag.   The food is always great. Lines do form at noon, so here's an idea...don't eat at noon. We either beat the lunch rush or hit the place after the rush is over.   I've NEVER had sandwich here that wasn't short of fantastic, and it is 'lunch in middle-America on a courthouse square' at its best. I don't eat deserts, but the line-up looks absolutely solid."}
{"text":"Such a cute \"hole in the wall\" restaurant! I loved the food and the atmosphere! The only complaint I had was,I had to wear my jacket the whole time because it was so cold in there!!!"}
{"text":"Very rarely do I visit a new town and eat at the same place twice. But the Brown Bag is no ordinary place.  It's sandwich nirvana.   Top quality, homemade ingredients combine to elevate an ordinary cobb salad to something else entirely -- roasted chicken, homemade blue cheese dressing, bacon, fresh tomatoes, lettuce -- I have never eaten a salad this satisfying.  The Dagwood. The Missie. These sandwiches are truly spectacular.  And don't miss the row of \"free condiments\" on the counter. The pickles are out of this world.  Seriously. It's 8 a.m. on a Tuesday morning and I just HAVE to log onto yelp to write about the pickles? This place is that good.  And then there's Harlene, who owns the place and takes your order. So much personality. I feel like I need to go back just to say \"hi.\"   If you're anywhere near Monticello, stop by the Brown Bag!"}
{"text":"Very glad to have stumbled upon this place :) fantastic lunch and sandwich location.   The restaurant had a very homely feel, and you could tell everything was made fresh. The fries were among the best I've ever had. Crispy and seasoned on the outside, with extremely soft interior.  The sandwiches were delicious, with good distribution of flavor and texture."}
{"text":"I love this place. Really good food and great desserts. Located in an interesting building."}
{"text":"A very nice little small town eatery. The people are very friendly and inviting. A very quaint and homey atmosphere. They have a nice little business going. The food is very good. The bread was great. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome family lunch place! Family owned and great homemade sandwiches an soups. Its in am old building, so don't be Afraid to walk in. If you are near Monticello be sure to stop by"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times to meet my husband for lunch.  I was a little put off by the HUGE wait for a sandwich, but everybody was so friendly and there was no problem getting a table.  I love the low, low prices.  Sandwiches are my favorite lunch item, and this place is amazing!  They have great wraps, sandwiches, subs and soups.  I haven't tried any of their Mexican dishes, because I love the creativity and originality of their regular menu items and their daily specials.  The desserts are great too, I usually split a slice of pie with my husband and each one has been great!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it has an important place in the history and social life of the town, but for someone from \"away\" looking for something good to eat in the area steer clear. Not much that has happened to food culture in the last 50 years has touched this place. Has lots of local authenticity and eccentricity, but not much else to offer, especially on the menu, in the interior, and how the owner interacts with her staff. Don't generally write negative reviews but was mislead by the raves this place received."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday. What a wonderful place to grab a bite! The choices were very extensive, everything sounded delicious. Pleasant surprise to find a ton of different kinds of pies. My lunch was fantastic... turkey with cranberry in a tortilla and tomato bisque soup! Yum! And the ladies behind the counter were super nice. Next time I'm in Monticello I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Much better food and old style surroundings than subway or either of the fast food options in Monticello.  Prices are reasonable and food is prepared fresh and fast.  I've been there several time and always enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I have gone to the Brown Bag for more than ten years. I always order a kids' cheese toastie because they come in a variety of breads (white, wheat, sourdough, rye, etc) and it is extra cheesy. I would label it as a staple of Midwest comfort food.   The Brown Bag also has many different sandwiches, salads, and soups. The best part about this place is the pie. They have fifteen different pies at any given time. They have fruit pies, chocolate pies, nut pies, and cream pies. You will surely find something that dances on your taste buds!  The price can rack up if you order a lot of food. But I like to keep it simple: a sandwich and a piece of pie. They have self-serve water if you need something to drink.   There is plenty of seating, so if you come in a group, it wouldn't be a problem to stick some tables together. Be sure to wonder around the Monticello square. There are some pretty sights to see, even in the Midwest.   Everyone that works there is super friendly and patient. It's a great place to go for all ages."}
{"text":"I've been here twice on mini-vacations, and it's wonderful. Their cream of asparagus soup is amazing, loaded with fresh mushrooms and asparagus. Get a warm roll, too. The Italian beef is excellent. Whatever you do, leave room for the fabulous pies."}
{"text":"I love the Brown Bag. It's the perfect little deli, and from what I can discern uses strictly fresh ingredients. Usually I'll check the specials online before deciding what to get. Their site is updated daily, and some specials are incredible.   When I don't see a special I opt for the Club Sub on wheat not toasted. It is a solid sandwich, and way better than stopping in Subway.   Be sure to try some of the baked goods they have in the dining area, but realize that those are created by the bakery behind the restaurant, Pies By Inge."}
{"text":"It's a decent deli and a source of pride in the community. Every one knows everyone so the gossip in the order line usually causes a long wait time to get an order in. Food is good and the decor is charming."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich shop. Probably my favorite since I've moved to Illinois for price/quality ratio. If you haven't been it is worth checking out the cute town and the great food from this place."}
{"text":"The homemade baked goods are pretty awesome.  I bought some cinnamon rolls that were to die for.   However, I agree with Tim G's review.  I am adding another star because they had rhubarb pie.     It's more the homey and folksy feel that is attractive about this place. It's very mid-American, diner on the square ambiance that's the attraction here. My veggie pita was not what I am used to where I live.  Brown Bag Deli needs to step it up and use something besides iceberg lettuce, but then I guess it wouldn't be vintage midwest using arugula."}
{"text":"I love The Brown Bag! From the ambience to the food quality, this place is a great local eatery. If you're in Monticello, it is absolutely essential to stop for pie. This place is pie heaven! They also have many other tasty offerings from soups and sandwiches to salads and pasta.   I'd recommend the chicken salad sandwich and a slice of their strawberry rhubarb pie with whipped cream and a cup of milk! Perfection!"}
{"text":"Sort of a lunch counter, casual deli.    Food is good, but nothing real special.   An interesting stop for a unique casual restaurant.  Must order at counter and pick up tray when order ready.  Often a 5-10 min line at noon time.      Off the Square about 1/2 block West."}
{"text":"Great owner.  Huge selection on menu and amazing desserts. Some of the seating could be maintained a little more.  The girl serving me gave me the wrong brownie by mistake but she corrected it.  When I felt that the peanut butter was missing from my pie the owner quickly corrected it.  Unfortunately, she made the girl feel so bad in front of me that I also felt bad for her.  I noticed the girl at the register turn customers away from ordering as it was almost their closing time.  I didn't think that was the best idea.  Overall, very happy with the food though!"}
{"text":"I've lived downtown Monticello for 2 years now and locals have always recommended this place.  I finally had the opportunity to try it out and I was in love.    I ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich and Broccoli & Cheese Soup.  I paid and waited at a table right in front of the register.  I noticed there are lots of places to sit and most people wait off to the right of the counter for their pick ups and then they go find a nook in the restaurant to eat.  When my name was called I was shocked at how big my sandwich was.  The sandwich was a perfect blend of flavors!  I really enjoy their 1000 Island Dressing.  My soup was also very good.  I think the soup had a strong chicken base.    When you pick up your food there are pickles available to customers too, which made my friend very happy!   The restaurant has street parking  (both parallel and diagonal parking).  The front door is just wide enough to fit a stroller.  I trusted the cleanliness of this place as nothing appeared dirty and nothing was sticky.    I highly recommend Brown Bag for your next trip in to Monticello!"}
{"text":"This deli is a great unexpected find in downtown Monticello. We stopped here on the way back from apple picking in Sullivan. They have a considerable menu of freshly made sandwiches, several soups, and a few Mexican items (nachos, etc.) They also have some incredibly delicious baked goods available for purchase, including German chocolate cake, pies, bars, and other treats.  We tried the Italian Fresco sandwich with chicken gumbo soup. The sandwich was served on thinly sliced sourdough bread, with a good helping of ham and salami, red onions, tomatoes, and lettuce with mayo and Italian dressing. It was delicious along with the piping hot soup. Brown Bag also provides a variety of condiments you can add on your own, including pickles and peppers.   Items are ordered and served up from the lunch counter. There's plenty of seating so you can find a comfortable table once you get your tray. It's fast and fresh and well worth a visit.  Update: I've had an opportunity to sample the bakery items here. The quality is incredibly good! I know that rhubarb pie is generally an acquired taste for many but it's something I grew up enjoying. The Brown Bag version of blueberry rhubarb is out of this world delicious. Flaky crust with generous portions of fruit make this a winner. Their brownies are tender and not overly sweet. I'm bumping up my score to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Really nice, legit, comfort food. I'm from the south side of Chicago and it reminds me of home. A cool place to get a good, fresh sandwich, good desserts (gluten free too), and able relax. It's important to have good independent places like this and in a small town is just great. I have friends in the area and will be back."}
{"text":"All sandwiches are soooo good, it's crowded but service is fast and friendly. Their salads are fresh and well served. The Dagwood sub was exceptional and the best sub I have ever had. The spinach salad was great. Chocolate cake was delicious."}
{"text":"Our cycling club stopped here last month. The sandwiches were absolutely delicious and the gigantic selection of pies is amazing! If you like pie, this is a must stop destination! The menu is a little hard to read from the register and it's huge! Not to worry, the staff are very friendly and accommodating. I wish this place was open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I am completely and utterly puzzled as to why this place has anymore than one or two stars. We aren't from this town so maybe we are spoiled with our cuisine in our city. But this place is FILTHY. This is a Gordon Ramsey nightmare. It needs updated and cleaned with carpets and booths replaced desperately.   Not only that but the counter girl was having an argument with a cook and it was embarrassing, awkward, and unprofessional.   Once we sat and saw the place we asked for our food to go. The food was mediocre at best. Basic sandwich I could put together in my own home kitchen. Tea tasted like a filter needed changed - very musty. Would never return or recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Los Angeles but recently visited Monticello, IL to check out a future location for his parents to live.  We visited The Brown Bag on our second day there, and fell in love with it!  We ended up eating there THREE times during the visit.  They have daily specials, great sandwiches, large soups, fresh salads and fruit, and -- best of all! -- AMAZING PIES!   You MUST get a slice of pie!  There were about 15 variations of insanely good pies.  The sandwiches were incredible as well.  I got the same Club Sub sandwich twice.   The folks that work there are sweet and friendly and the atmosphere is casual and warm."}
{"text":"Egg salad & cole slaw!!!  This place is yumazing! Most all of their items are homemade. Their egg salad is phenomenal. It has nice large chunks of egg in a smooth, creamy sauce. The coleslaw is sweet and crisp. Also be sure to try their bakery items. Once again, they are all homemade. Something surely will be there to tempt your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"So when I used to tell people I've lived here all my life and never tried brown bag, they looked at me like I had 2 heads. Now I know why I've never been.  I've been 3 times now.   First time, I had the egg salad on wheat toast. I seriously could have made this in my sleep at home. Why pay someone else to make it??  Second time, I had soup, it was cold and tasted like what I used to reheat at McDonald's when I was a teenager.  Last time I had the taco salad, again, nothing to write home about.   If you like mom and pops places that substitute from you actually cooking, this place is for you. But I love to cook and will just keep cooking at home."}
{"text":"You can't beat the baked goods sold at the counter!  The rocky road brownie is 4 gallons of awesome in a 3 gallon bucket i'm serious they are ridiculously delicious.    I always check out the Brown Bag's daily specials just to see what new and interesting sandwiches have.  Most recently I got to experience the magic that is Rachel's fish taco.  It was the best! warm, fresh, and bursting with flavor I tell you I could have eaten it all day long.   The salsa on top was the best I have had since I moved to Illinois.    The staff is always friendly when I come in and the food is prepared quickly.    The restaurant itself is a little on the homey side, a simple building attached two 2 shops and an art gallery/framing business with apartments up stairs.    The owner Harlene Swing Is one of the nicest people you will get the pleasure of meeting and takes a great interest in her guests.    Stop on in for some great sandwiches and soups and don't forget to get a slice of pie or a brownie before you leave, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really good food, great variety, reasonable prices. Have been here several times and always had the same experience. Locals stand in line for lunch so it must be the norm. Staff is very friendly and treats people like family. I had the turkey mushroom cream cheese spinach sandwich. The sandwich was fresh and earthy. Could have used some spiciness or flavor added but still good. Atmosphere was a bit dated but quaint. Recommend trying it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The best! Every time I'm in town I try to make a point to go here. Their sandwiches are always good and you can usually find a sweet treat to go with it. I love how casual this place is and how quickly you get your food. I wish I could duplicate it and have it in C-U!"}
{"text":"Great little local lunch spot. Classic sandwiches just like your grandmother made. I'm not a dessert person but their pies look delicious!"}
