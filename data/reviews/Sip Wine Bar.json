{"text":"Love that I can get wine (the really good stuff) by the glass. Pizza is the way to go!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place by accident on a Saturday night, after being disappointed at the long waits and outright refusals at several other restaurants in the area. Even though they were also busy, the host at Sip made an effort to accommodate us right away, squeezing us in before a later wave of reservations From there on, we loved everything about this place. Cool ambiance, though it was tight. Friendly service; though our server was very busy, he was still quite attentive. My wife had the risotto, which was decent. I  don't recommend it though; pizza, which is what I ordered, is their thing. It was so good my wife ignored her risotto and ate half my meal, which was still big enough to fill us both up. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Same as the rest of the Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood. Food is as good as the rest of the competition. The bonus about this place is the fun atmosphere. It's great for meal with friends. The staff is amazingly friendly as well as the owner. It's great for a fun relaxed dinner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. New favourite place to go, hands down.   I went with a friend on a Friday night around 630 and just beat the rush. We shared the Calzone and the Risotto al Funghi. Both were authentic and so tasty. Our server, Luisa, was very friendly and attentive.  After we finished, we were chatting and finishing our wine when a manager, Carm, came over and asked us if we would mind moving to the bar (as there was now a lineup to get in) and that our next drinks were on him. We didn't mind at all and he was very pleasant and appreciative.  He also gave us a full tour of the restaurant when we casually asked him what used to occupy the space (turns out it was apartments). He took the time to make our experience extra special.  While at the bar we met Sully, the bartender. She made us two drinks she had been working on: a mojito with a twist and what she calls a \"cucumber basil Sully\". They were both fabulous. She is an absolute delight and a great bartender! The owner, Vince, even came over and introduced himself and thanked us for our business.   I can't say enough good things about this place. Everyone was so incredibly friendly and gracious and our experience was absolutely outstanding."}
{"text":"Too oily. Way too expensive. Small portions.  I ordered the lamb while my mother had the salmon. For the exorbitant prices, you'd have thought the side accompaniments would have been more than a baby potato, slice of red pepper and a couple of asparagus.    The waitress did not ask me how I'd like my lamb cooked and so it arrived medium rare. I'm no expert but it was slightly cold in the middle.  To their credit, tiramisu was excellent. Liqueur flavouring was intensely delicious.   Service could have been more attentive. Again, the prices are just simply say too high."}
{"text":"Average food and very e pensive wine. We will not return, very  Overpriced"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood gem with awesome pizza and fantastic service.   We stopped by for lunch the day before my wedding and were promptly seated. I explained the the waiter that we were in a bit of a time crunch and she said that was no problem. The Pizza came out very quickly and was perfectly cooked. Wonderfully delicious cheese and fresh toppings. I'd certainly go back here again."}
{"text":"Where to begin...  First time going was actually for my engagement dinner, it was hosted by the lovely server Louisa and the manager Vince and ever since that time myself, my fianc√© and my family have been hooked!  The food is incredible truly authentic Neapolitan style pizza, excellent pasta, impressive selection of Italian wine- and they know their stuff! And of course for the sweet tooth a delicious slice of cheesecake or a piece of tiramisu served with a cappuccino for good measure.  Hopefully you get served by Louisa with her pleasant smile and cheerful welcoming attitude and get welcomed in by Vince who makes you feel as if your at a relatives.  You can truly not go wrong with Sip!  We'll be back many more times in the future!  Mark"}
{"text":"The place seems great but there was no room to manoeuvre between tables - seriously - every time the person sitting at the table behind me needed to get up, I had to get up and tuck in my chair so there was enough room to get out. Not sure if this is a regular thing or it was just the night I was there but it was definitely inconvenient. Also, with the tables so close together you can barely hear the people at your table talking :( will maybe try it again someday, but no time soon"}
{"text":"I got a Groupon deal ( $60 dinner for two), only because previous Yelp reviews for food were mostly positive. I thought that it's worth it to try, and able to ignore the bad customer service part.  As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were seated on the small two person table right next to large window. Significant amount of wind came through the window ( it was -8'C outside) and the table was small for our meal plan for dinner. So I asked to our waiter to switch our table to 4person one. It's Monday dinner time, only two tables were occupied, and restaurant was pretty empty.  Our waiter hesitated and asked me why. I gave him my reason nicely. Then he asked me with unpleasant tone 'are you guys gonna order lots of food?'.  So I just said ' I'd prefer a larger table'.   Food was good. We got an arugula salad ( which was pretty good: it comes with Brie cheese and pine nut), fondue sauce pasta( very creamy and super filling, slight over priced), and creamy salami pizza ( nicely spicy). I was actually glad that food was good.   Our waiter came and asked us whether we are still working on it. I thought that he was asking about our main food, so I said yes. The waiter said that he wasn't asking for our food, but wine, and asked  us whether we want more wine. I replied we are ok. And somehow he was still standing right next to our table, so I thought that he was trying to take the empty plate. So I gave him the empty plate.  He took the plate and walked 2-3steps away then walked back to us. He said ' did you just give me this plate??'.  I said 'yes'.  He gave me the most unpleasant facial expression, which I couldn't understand why.  My husband couldn't say anything either since we didn't know what's going on with him tonight.   We decided not to interact with him anymore, that includes no dessert and not staying longer. We still left some tip: not for our waiter but for the kitchen staff( hopefully).   If you can ignore sarcastic comments on every conversation you make with the waiter, go here.  At least you will enjoy food."}
{"text":"Great food and a nice place to have a glass of wine recommended to everyone when you are in the area and want something different i urge you to go in and see what i mean enjoy"}
{"text":"This is strictly a Service, not Food, review as I never got to a table.  Service Stinks. My wife and I walked by the establishment about 4PM while doing some local grocery shopping (we live nearby). The fellow at the bar, who was going over some business details along with a few others, asked me if I needed assistance. We had already looked at the menu (first time at the place) so, interested in what we saw, asked to my dinner reservations. After setting a time up, I asked, given that it was a beautiful summer evening, if making a table selection was possible. After receiving a yes answer, I asked for the specific table at the outer edge of the dinning area, overlooking the street. No problem. The fellow took down my name, time, and....table number.   Fast forward 3 hrs, the restaurant is full and happening. However, glancing over the seating area, I see the table we asked for occupied by a guest couple (early into their dinning experience as per what was on the table in front of them) with the last remaining outdoor facing table just being filled by another couple. WTF!!!  By this time, the boy-genius maitre'd asked if we had a table reserved. I said yes, but you gave it away. He advised that they didn't reserve specific tables, just made time  reservations. I was now starting to feel that I was in a Seinfeld episode. I advised the M'd (the previous reservation taker was not in sight), that the earlier guy said yes and specifically wrote down the number of the table (which I rememebered). After quoting him the number, he just blankly looked at me and said he doesn't know the table numbers. Really! This s coming from the Maitre'd. I asked the waitress who was now standing besides us, who looked at me with a nervous smile, and responded with some verbal blather that basically told me that they screwed up and didn't want to acknowledge their mistake. Nothing. Or maybe, just maybe, boy-genius really is a genius and can remember where everybody is or will be, on every calendar day, and that he knows that such table numbers are not necessary, for he knows, in his vast protruding mind, where everyone will sit forever after.    What an idiot."}
{"text":"This place is great. Love the summer patio! Great decor, servers are polite and quick. I've eaten the pizza, garden salad, spaghetti & creme brulee. I've been 3 times and every time it's an excellent experience. The creme brulee is one of the best I've had. I like the different types of bread at the beginning of the meal."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new local pizza/pasta place.  The decor is nice and inviting.  The menu has something for everyone.  I ordered the roasted chicken which had an odd fish taste...My husband had pizza which he enjoyed.  Overall a nice, quick dinner."}
{"text":"after making a reservation at Tio's Urban Mexican up the street and being turned away as they had over booked. Sip graciously seated us and provided amazing service all night. Not to mention that pizza is amazing! This place is reliable and delicious"}
{"text":"I brought a group of 7 people from out of town for dinner on a Saturday. The restaurant was not overly busy when we arrived but we were rushed through each stage of our meal- choosing menu items, plates being cleared when others were not finished eating, pressure to choose a dessert. The food was mediocre for a place that specializes in Italian food. The wine selection was ok. The customer service was extremely poor. Our server had an anxious personality & was very abrupt and interrupted us numerous times. The owner told us that we had overstayed our 2 hour time slot (which was not communicated upon arrival), however our server had not brought us our bills yet. I would not return."}
{"text":"The food was great. I had their Seafood Linguine and was loaded with lots of Seafood. The ambience was great and my server was exceptional.  What I did not like was off their wine menu they were out of stock of at least 40% of the Wines. So I ended up having a beer :(  Pricing was decent.  I would reccommend this establishment and would be great for a date!"}
{"text":"The service & ambience was great but the pasta was horrible. Got the pappardelle (with sausage, peas, etc...) but asked for rose sauce instead of tomato. They accommodated but it was only pasta & sauce with no toppings whatsoever. At first I thought they mixed it up and would only charge the me the basic pasta price (penne ' vodka rose $14) but ended charging me the full price ($17 or so). The pasta was also horrible. Probably store bought. Very bland. The tiramisu was disappointing. It was well...very wet? More like a watery mousse. A few other friends got pasta as well but I forget what they ordered. Either way they said it was mediocre at best. That said, one friend said the pizza was good. Oh, and the wine was nice. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Was excited when I heard that a new Neapolitan Pizza place opened up in my area so I was eager to try this place out. I made reservations to attend with 3 fellow diners who were equally as keen on welcoming Sip to the neighbourhood as a new staple.  Service was okay -- our waitress was friendly and amicable. Great breads and dips started off the night; we couldn't get enough!  This is what was ordered:  * Caprese: nice and fresh, but small in portion (6/10) * Pizza Bruschetta: great tomato bruschetta, this one was a winnder (8/10)  * Gnocchi: mushy and dull (6/10) * Funghi Pizza: dough was tasty but overcooked and the toppings were sparse (6/10) * Sip Pizza: better than the latter and pretty unique but again hardly any toppings and was quite overdone (6/10) * Tronchetto: small, again sparse on toppings and nothing special (6/10)  Because of allergies, one of my fellow diners asked to substitute a topping which they refused to do until we spoke to the manager. The waitress claimed that the chef did not like to make changes as his recipes needed to be serves as he imagined them... I understand this in theory but they also offer a Build-Your-Own pizza! Strange!  Food was on very expensive considering the portions and the fare, but we remained hopeful that taste and quality would make it worthwhile. Unfortunately the pizzas and pastas fell short of our expectations.   If it was less expensive I'd be inclined to visit again, but alas I'll be sticking to Grazie's when it comes to Italian food in the area."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Sip Wine Bar. They were host to my company's launch celebration. The staff, Louisa and Vince were fantastic, the food was delicious and plentiful and of course the drinks were marvellous and flowing. They literally catered to our every need and wish. The atmosphere was perfect and they didn't miss a single detail. My 35 guests were all thrilled with the venue and everything about the evening. I would book another event there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance, good service, food was ok. I had a italian sausage pasta and it was ok but I've had better. The Ennomatic wine machine was busted so there wine list by the glass was quite limited. My play mate had a margarita pizza and it was a bit bland/pedestrian."}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  We have tried going to this restaurant twice now and after the last experience will definitely not be returning. Like others we were excited to try an Italian pizza place in the neighbourhood comparable to Pizzeria Libretto (which is hands down the best Neapolitan style pizza in the city).  Last Saturday we made reservations for 8:30 and we showed up at 8:30 excepting a table to be set-up and a friendly hostess waiting to greet us and take us to our table. However when we arrive there was a crowd of people still waiting to be seated and a hostess nowhere to be seen. We approached a young man, asked him how long it would take to seat us and he honestly had no idea and said \"a little while\". The hostess showed up 5 minutes later and told us \"let me see what I can do\" and disappeared. The group in front of us had been waiting since 8! And still hadn't been seated.   Basically what they are doing is taking in more walk-ins to stay busy and giving away the reserved tables.  We left and went to a great place down the street where the food and service is always impeccable."}
{"text":"Wine selection was fair...for a wine bar, we would expect a more extensive selection. The service was attentive...though no suggestions were offered, so we cannot ascertain the expertise of our server. Didn't try the food, but looked appealing. Nice venue. All in all...we would come back."}
{"text":"Just had an opportunity to try this new Italian establishment in the Yonge and Eglinton area. Visited on a Friday around 7 pm and didn't have to wait.   First impression of decor was just ok. Nothing special but nice and cosy. We were seated at our table and then tableware and wine glasses were set. They were busy and in their first week of operation so ill cut them some slack.   Table was wobbly so I had to add some bar napkins at the bottom to stabilize. Ordered the house red wine and two pizzas from the menu.  Pizzas arrived relatively fast. We ordered both the margherita and spicy salami pizzas. Pizzas were relatively good but not really comparable to Libretto or Tennessee Williams in Ottawa. The wine came after the pizza arrived.   Service was good considering they were busy and having some computer issues. They also don't take American Express which was slightly inconvenient.   Overall am happy I tried it and may visit again in the future especially if more vegetarian pasta items are added to the menu."}
{"text":"First time experiencing this place and all I can say is wow. The food, the staff was fantastic. I was never impressed like this before. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone :D"}
{"text":"Nice place and service. The burrata is delicious!!! Highly recommend. We also ordered calamaris and pizzas they were good as well."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, food is good, location is ideal. Good for a group - lots to choose from.  Recently we had bad service because we were sitting in the basement (no water, little attention, rude server) but for the most part it's a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Made a reso easily day of for two. Was seated as soon as I arrived. They even allowed us to choose where we sat. The waiter was quite friendly and very prompt. I ordered a glass of Nero D'avola, reasonably priced smooth glass of red wine. For my main I had a pizze rosse capricciosa. Twas yummy! I would defining go back."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant and in summer is great with the doors/windows open.  We had our orders taken and never saw the waitress again until we asked for the bill.  She said she had a big party and was told we were taken care of.  We weren't.  We each ordered a pizza and they were good.  The disappointment was the caprese salad.  I thought it had a nice presentation but it was seriously the most boring salad ever.  It's as though no seasoning was put on it at all. It was slices of plain tomato and plain mozzarella so overall it was bland.  We may have ordered another glass of wine or dessert but no one ever came back to our table.  I did mention this to server because I don't think leaving a minimal tip is very enlightening so she explained the situation.  She offered a splash of wine or dessert but we were ready to leave.  I will have to give it to the server assistant who took our silverware and replaced it with fresh.  You don't really see that anymore.  They just need to note seat numbers when ordering so delivered food doesn't need to be auctioned off."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night with a few girlfriends, with the intention to relax over a glass of wine. The place is pack and cozy... Be mindful when you move around or even leaning back in your chair!  For those who don't mind the intimate environment, the pizza, gnocchi and vino is worth going for. There`s a large list of pizza options, too many to choose.  Each plate portion may ne sharable too (more the merrier). Bring some friends to try a bit of everything  Going downstairs to the washroom, I noticed theres a dining room you may have a party meal. The area looks great for a gathering of family and friends!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here this past Saturday and we loved it. We sat at the bar by choice because the restaurant was full, when a table became available we opted to stay at the bar.  The bartender greeted us warmly and made us feel welcome. We had 2 bottles of wine and some appetizers, first the charcuterie board with beautiful meats and cheeses and a wonderful honey then we had the calamari/shrimp again another winner and finally the meatballs which were great too. The place is bustling and has a nice warm vibe. A lot of staff and what I can only assume was the owner in a pink shirt making sure everyone was happy. I don't know what the bartenders name was ( she probably told us but 2 bottles of wine later...) she was fantastic. In an area where restaurants are opening and closing at the drop of a hat I hope that this little gem keeps up the good food/service, we will be back...next time to try the pizza and of course the Primitivo."}
{"text":"First off let me say that later on a Saturday night it's a zoo so it probably isn't totally fair to rate them solely on this experience. But I will share my input. The place gets so noisy you can't even hear the person across from you. People are jostling to get in between tables which doesn't make for a really nice dining experience. Pizzas are very overpriced for the amount of toppings and the consistency is bla.  I would not recommend pizza. One of our table's pasta dish was not a big hit either. It was very generic, not much flavor or ingredients. Great wine list. The waiter was sporadic...run off of his feet. The location is fantastic which is why they will do very well & they will do well with people who don't know good Italian food. Better choices in the area."}
{"text":"So, I just went to this restaurant with my lady the other day. I was excited as it new and they advertised authentice Italian pizza.  Service - The wait staff took quite some time to grab our initial drink and order food. There was a few of them standing around. After the meal, they also talked about us in Italian, which I understood. I thought that that was rude of them. (We asked if they have alternatives to pork on a pizza such as chicken) Then they looked as us and laughed as if we were crazy for asking.   Food - Food was good, although not very friendly when it comes to offering maybe something for those who do not eat pork. I ordered the Sip Pizza, which was very good actually. So we really liked the food.   decor - Place looked nice but I didn't really feel like there was a theme for the place.   Price - Average price was around $15 - $25. Decent pricing but our appetizer was just as much as our meal.   I don't know if I will go back. Good but not memberable. I understand this place is new but these are the things that make people go back again and again."}
{"text":"My review is based upon delivery only.   I randomly found this on the foodora app, and it is my go to choice for my pasta cravings. I've had their meatballs, which have so much flavor, and I don't find them hard like other places. Enough tomato sauce too, to keep it from getting dry. Their burrata is so fresh and filling! I am not a fan of regular tomato slices, but the ones they use compliment the cheese so well. They are so juicy and don't have a soggy texture.   For pasta, I always get the agnolotti in the cream sauce with the black truffle paste. Holy moly it is good!! I find restaurants can really give you such a small portion on these type of dishes, but I find there's enough for leftovers. The sauce isn't overly heavy, and the taste is incredibly luxurious (is that possible to say?) My folks always get the tiger shrimp and swordfish, and they thoroughly enjoy their meal every time!   For dessert, I get their white chocolate cheesecake. This has got to be some of the best cheesecake I've ever had. I'm not a fan of the fruit compote on top, but I just scrape it off. The cheesecake is not dense, and is perfectly creamy. The crust compliments it so well, and I think it's time to order some delivery for later tonight!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, wine was pretty good, however the food was awful. My chicken came out and was completely dry, the salmon my partner ate was also very dry and tasteless. Extremely overpriced for the quality of the dish. They really need to hire a better chef!"}
{"text":"I was here a week ago on a Saturday to celebrate my birthday. The place was packed. We were seated downstairs at a very funky wood table. There was 16 of us. All the food was delicious. I had fish special. It was delicious. Most guests ordered pasta dishes. Their feedback was also good. Fried calamari was amazing. We ordered pizzas for appetizers. They were also very good, thin crust. The stuff is very accommodating. We were allowed to bring our own cake and have separate bills which is awesome for a large party. The service was perfect: polite, knowledgeable, and timely. Louisa was our server and she was fantastic. I was running late to my own birthday party. When I called, the man on the phone told me not to worry and offered to put an order of pizza at a time as the guests arrive instead of bringing all the pizzas at once letting them get cold. That way even if the host is late, the guest will have fresh pizza to snack on as they arrive. I thought it was very kind and considerate of them, even though it would create more work for the kitchen to cook one pizza at a time. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! Great ambiance, came here with a friend on a Wednesday evening. I saw a few negative reviews about the service, but I found the service to be outstanding! Our server was very attentive, and he recommended a great choice of wine and dessert. We will most definitely be back! They also validate from the underground parking right next door."}
{"text":"Really great food and attentive waiter, he seemed a little overwhelmed by the size of our group (we had the private room downstairs). He had some trouble splitting the bill but it was fine and we were able to work it out.   The wine was very good however and our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu. A little pricier than I'd have liked, but definitely nice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Me and my husband saw this place advertised on the Groupon website for Valentines day so we deiced to go here. We made the reservation 2 days before coming. After arriving at 6pm, the host (who was the manager) could not find our reservation in his book. He then told us to \"please seat yourselves anywhere\". After we have our dinner we ask for our bill. We placed our Groupon voucher on the check and the server ignored it. I said \"Hey we will be using this Groupon today and he said \"No sorry, we are not taking this today\". Confused, I asked how come? Its not written on the coupon anywhere. He said \"I know it is not written anywhere but my manager told me we are not taking this.\" I asked to speak to the manager and he told me \" he will say no as well\" I said that is fine I would just like to speak to him to clarify why this is not accepted today, since there is no explanation. The server walks away laughing to the bartender as the manager comes over. He tells me \" No we are not taking this today\" I asked him why they are not accepting it since it does not say anywhere on the voucher that there are certain days on which it would be invalid. He told me that since it is \"busy\" (there were 6 other couples eating, far from busy) that they will not take it. I said that makes no sense and had I known I would have chosen a different place to eat. He told me \" Well everyone else called today and asked me if they can use it and I said no so you should have known to call as well\" I said we called 2 days ago to make the reservation and no one informed us, it was not written on your website or on Groupon. There was absolutely no way of knowing that it was not going to be accepted that day. He said \" well no we are not accepting this\" and WALKED AWAY. NO OTHER COMPENSATION. Nothing. Not even a sincere apology, which would have made everything better. The way he handled us as customers was terrible, you can tell he does not give a care. Terrible management. I will not be coming back to SIP wine bar and I will be telling everyone I know not to come here. Paying $105 for dinner and getting this type of service is 100% unacceptable. I am so dissapointed and upset that my Valentines dinner was ruined by the management and servers acting so poorly. I will be in contact with Groupon to get a refund for the voucher."}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks after dinner tonight. Was a little unsure of this spot at first, based on the mixed reviews, but I would have to say that it impressed us! We had a few glasses of wine and shared an \"not on the menu\" charcuterie board - which was one of the better ones I've had in the city!  Wine list was better than average, though I must confess I stuck to my ever faithful J. Lohr, instead of trying the waiter's recommendations lol. We ended our visit with a few cappuccinos, which were good, but a little on the light tasting side and the only thing lacking lustre for the evening. Service was very good and will def be back - good to know there's a spot like this in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"A Yelp search for Italian restaurants around Yonge & Eglinton brought us here, despite it not being our first choice. It was our third choice, behind Grazie and La Vecchia, listed first and second respectively, which both had a wait of 30-45 minutes. Meanwhile, we were able to get seated immediately at SIP.  We decided to sit at the bar, as our two options for tables were seated pretty close to the adjacent tables, and we wanted to carry a conversation without interfering or being interfered by the neighbouring diners. The bartender quickly greeted us, directed us to the wine menu, and also mentioned that he can make any classic cocktail or we can \"roll the dice\" and allow him to concoct a creation for us. He seemed pretty passionate about his craft so I requested something with dark rum and was served a twist on a rum sour.  As for food, I got the agnolotti ($20.95) stuffed with fresh meat in a fondue of fontina cheese and black truffle paste, and my cousin got a diavola pizza. The portion of the pasta was pretty big. I probably could've saved half of it for leftovers, but if you put a plate of pasta in front of me, I will definitely finish it! The menu described it as a \"fondue of fontina cheese\" which is pretty accurate as the pasta was swimming in a pool of a light cream sauce with subtle hints of the black truffle. My cousin offer me a slice of her pizza and we used the crusts to scoop up some of the remaining sauce. I tend to not be a fan of pizza made in stone ovens as they sometimes have the texture of cardboard, but their pizza was actually soft! For dessert, we split the creme brulee ($8.99) which had Frangelico and Grand Marnier in it. It was a nice, interesting variation, and you could definitely taste the orange from the liquer.   To both of our surprises, we were pleased with our meals and the attentive, personalized service from the bartender. It did rank third in the Yonge & Eglinton area, so we're curios to see how the other two restaurants compare, though we do recommend SIP!"}
{"text":"My husband really wanted to try this new place in the Yonge and Eglinton area, so I reluctantly agreed, because I wasn't in the mood for pizza. I'm so glad I went! We got there at about 6pm on Saturday night (because our movie was sold out..might as well eat).  We sat at the bar and the bartender was super nice. Pretty eyes, too. It was a guy btw. He told us that the chef is actually a 24 year old prodigy from Italy. Wow! I can tell you, prodigy pretty much describes it. We ate:  Fried calamari and shrimp - delicious and not such a huge portion that you feel sick. Shared between 2 people, it was perfect. Yummy dipping sauce (mayo-based. I hate those marinara dipping sauces). Meatballs - comes with about 4 small meatballs on the plate, with some arugula. So good...delicious sauce and again, perfect for an appetizer - you can eat dinner after and not feel like a pig. We shared the Sip pizza. It didn't say it on the menu, but this particular pizza is sort of like a half-calzone. At first I was confused because it appeared that they had forgotten the ricotta and proscciutto toppings, but hey - there they were, folded into the crust. I wasn't a huge fan of this configuration, because only two of the four pieces contained those toppings. Eh. Let me know about something like this before I order, okay? Otherwise, perfect pizza. The crust was chewy and amazing. Everything was delicious. The wine selection is great (duh it's a wine bar) and we drank some deelish reds - try the Croce - wow. Ambience was a bit bare but dimly lit and cozy. There were kids there. Generally, I got out to get AWAY From my kids, sorry folks. I was sort of annoyed but since we sat at the bar, it was okay. Oh yeah - we also had dessert - this strawberry granita layered in a martini glass with whipped cream that tasted like it was about 80% milk fat. You could totally tell that the granita was house made. The owner was walking around greeting people all night so you know he's got his eye on stuff - which is good. We're definitely going back to Sip."}
{"text":"Friendly owner, great staff, nice pleasant decor and good food made this place really good for a night out with my wife.   The name is slightly misleading as I would say the place is more pizza / pasta restaurant than it is a wine bar, but nonetheless, we enjoyed the wine and the food. I ordered a pizza and found it delicious (but could have used a few more toppings than were provided) and my wife ordered a pasta which she absolutely loved.    The restaurant is family friendly, and good for a date night. We will be returning with the kids and by ourselves in the future."}
{"text":"SIP Wine Bar is a new Italian place in the Yonge-Eg area; it's at Yonge/Broadway so you'll have to walk a couple blocks north of Eglinton.   When my pal and I went on a Thursday night, it was packed in spite of the disgusting weather outside. There's a bar area surrounded by the dinking room - it looks like a small place from the outside, but you can easily fit 50 people in here. We were seated right by the kitchen - don't worry, this place is clean as I was able to see this right from where I was sitting. I had a pizza with spicy salami - it was okay. My pal had the rissotto and she was not a fan, unfortunately. We ordered a couple glasses of wine. For a wine bar, the wine menu is limited.   The food here is a-ok, but it's quite expensive...  Good for: pizza, wine"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this restaurant except the cold, decent glasses of house wine for $8.  I woke up with something akin to food poisoning this morning from the food.  Under cooked and tasteless mushroom pizza which I would have sent back but I didn't want to be rude to the friend who chose the restaurant.  Indifferent salads and service to boot. Packed with undiscerning customers so good for them."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place has gotten such great reviews. Our experience, unfortunately wasn't great.  I ordered the 8oz chicken( which is a $24 plate, and was served a portion that weighed 5oz, at best and a few vegetables that were extremely salty ( they tasted like the salt shaker had been dropped in them!). When our server asked us how our food was, and I mentioned that the vegetables were too salty, he actually argued with me that \"they weren't\", and made a fuss that would not have been greater if I had insulted his own mother's cooking! LOL . Since are are on the topic of food, the bruschetta  we ordered was also very bland and ordinary, and in no way deserving of it's price point., and although my friends asked if they could PURCHASE a chicken plate ( an OTHER $24 plate), in order to have it cut up, added to their already expensive and bland  pasta, this request was also denied..   Now, I would make due with bland tasting food, if the service had been amazing, however, sadly the service was also extremely lack lustre, read: slow rude and errors were made to our bill, and no, no apologies were made. Meh. Never going back.. definitely. Not if you paid me!"}
{"text":"Recent visits to Sip have been disappointing. Perhaps short staffed. After ordering the wait time for our meals have been extraordinarily long. Sometimes 30 mins between appetizers and entrees. The manager is often seated at the bar or with patrons when staff are run off their feet. Some of the staff are too comfortable and unprofessional. It's not the Sip we're used to and fell in love with. It will be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and meet up with friends. Excellent pizza and they make a great mojito.  The decor is great and the bar is always a good time"}
{"text":"The pizza crust itself was delicious, but there were so few toppings that you needed a microscope to see them. The pizza was swimming in tomato sauce so it had to be eaten with a knife and fork, you could not pick up a slice and eat it.  The waiter was pushing hard for us to order a bottle of wine, although some people wanted beer and a couple just wanted a glass of wine. Meatballs were on the bland side. The place was busy, so somebody had a positive experience."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we loved the taste of the pizza. Very delicious!   We went again to try other things and fell in love with the mushroom risotto. Since then, we have ordered the risotto for take out when we don't feel like cooking. Things were going great, until one day, the risotto had the consistency of soup and was way undercooked. I called and they dropped off another order, and it was fine. Thinking it was just a one-time thing, I got risotto again. Again, undercooked and soupy consistency. I called to let them know and they replaced it again. Now I am starting to wonder if my tastes have changed because I still find it undercooked. Or maybe one chef makes it magical and the other one doesn't. I have no idea.   For the price though (comes to just over $50 for two orders, with tip), I am thinking that I do not want to risk it again.  One thing I will give them is that the service here has been excellent! All the servers have been great, but I especially love the super nice server who always calls me \"bella\", she is the greatest!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, beautiful lighting, good wine, good pizza, much needed little place in the neighborhood. Mussels were awesome too.  The staff is also very friendly and genuine, which is rare in this city.  The pizza is a bit overpriced, but overall it's a pleasant experience and I would go again."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  Discovered this place by accident as me and my friend were walking by.  We decided to check it out and were quite surprised!  The inside of this place is really nice - a great first date, 5th date or just hanging out with friends celebrating a birthday kinda place.  The warm and inviting ambiance just lends itself for you to sit back and spill all your secrets here!  It's pretty big inside as well so it can handle larger groups.  We were here on a Wednesday and the place was packed.  Since we had already eaten elsewhere, we just ordered a pizza to share - Margherita pizza.  This is enough for 2 people - 2 big slices.  I've had better, but it was ok.  I was expecting more basil but the mozza was pretty nice.      The staff are really friendly and I am definitely going to come back and try some other items off the menu.  The prices are pretty reasonable so I am excited for summer (when will the warm weather come??!) to come back here."}
{"text":"OK, second chance. I came back here to give them another chance.  As a compliment, Front of the house was nice,good ambience (if a bit quiet at 4:30pm on a Monday), friendly man serving at the bar.  I ordered the mussels in tomato sauce.   Unfortunately, as with my previous review, it was underseasoned (they don't use enough salt), and underflavoured.  Even worse, about 5 or 6 mussels in the batch had broken shells. This means that someone didn't take the care to ensure that all of the shellfish was fresh, clean and alive at the time of cooking. You know the rules about shellfish, right? I thought that was the chef's job to ensure that substandard food doesn't go out of the kitchen. I just hope I don't get sick tonight from bad mussels.  I don't think I'll be giving them a third chance."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see that a new pizza place was opening down the street from us. We've been a few times now and every time the food was very good - I have not had anything there that I didn't enjoy. The staff is friendly and tries hard. My only complaint is the speed of the kitchen. When I went with a small group 2-4 people, it wasn't too bad. But anytime I've gone with a large group, it's like it's too much to handle and we had to wait a while for the food. The owners try to make up for it by asking how you're doing and apologizing if you've been waiting - hopefully they're just working out the kinks because the food really is very good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here in the summer and I've been meaning to go back ever since. I recently went for dinner with a co-worker for dinner and we both enjoyed our meals. I had a pizza and really enjoyed it - loved the chewy, crisp crust! My co-worker had the papardelle and said it was delicious. We also had a couple glasses of wine, which were well-priced and very enjoyable.   I was very impressed with our server as he was extremely polite and knowledgeable about the menu, which I expect at most places, but don't always get. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"A year later...and I'm kicking it up a star for this neighbourhood wine bar!  I've now eaten here several times and the pizza is really and truly excellent. Probably my favourite pizza anywhere uptown.  The crust is addictive; the flavours delicious. My favourite pie is the Diavola with spicy salami....which I always enjoy with some 'hot oil' on the side for extra kick. Wine offerings are quite good (this being a wine bar, after all)...and the servers are always happy to bring you a complimentary tasting to help you make a selection.  Plus, the space, all exposed brick, is uber cool.  But be careful...some pizzas are 'bianca' which means white, aka no sauce. It clearly says \"Bianca\" on the menu but in case your Italian isn't great, I thought I'd mention it. My friend ordered one without realizing it but the server happily brought her a side of marinara sauce for dipping.  In conclusion, PIZZA."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place out after seeing it on Yelp. They have an amazing selection of wine - including my new favorite the Chardonnay from Argentina. Their Bruschetta and Gnocchi pasta were the best. My girlfriend loved their tiramisu. Definitely a place we will come back to again."}
{"text":"I checked out this place tonight with a fellow yelper and I'm really being generous with the two stars that I'm giving this place.  The d√©cor is decent and warm but from the moment you walk in, the atmosphere doesn't really feel all that welcoming. I arrived first and decided to wait at the bar. The wine was actually very fruitful and tasty - I believe it was the Riesling, it was good and I would recommend it.  When my friend arrived, we found service deteriorated. She had trouble getting the bartenders attention. After a few minutes, I went to the hostess to ask for a table and she was totally inconspicuous to the fact that there were two of us sitting at the bar or that we had even come into the place.  We were offered two tables: one next to the door where a construction truck was positioned outside or the \"chef's table\" which was basically in the kitchen. Once seated, service continued to be slow at best and the place was full but not busy.  The meal was underwhelming. I am not one to analyze what I am eating except when I'm trying to figure out why I love or hate the dish. In this case, I was wondering why with every spoonful my glass of water needed to be close at hand. I ordered one of their risotto dishes and after much reflection, I believe the risotto was undercooked and it had been cooked in WAY too much truffle oil. On the positive side, there were a good number of mushrooms in the dish and they were cooked perfectly.  All in all, for the price you pay, it's not worth it. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"These chefs and waiters know exactly what they're doing. Raymondo was one of the best servers I've ever had. He cared about every lady detail of our meal. Our table got a variety of dishes to share and they were all impressive. There is much more than pizza. the lamb was succulent, flavourful and fresh. The pizza was authentically delicious. The calamari was lightly breaded and seasoned to perfection. The seafood risotto was nice (not a show stopper).  Check this place out. Much better than the other Italian restaurants in the area. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My mother always said hate is a strong word but I think I hate this place. Let me set the scene: Exhausted mom of a 7-month-old baby (who happens to be teething AND is sick) excitedly orders insalata di rucola, frittura mista (this was just auto corrected to frittura mistake! Ha!), diavola, and the panna cotta. Yes, yes,yes... This was all for me. I'm still nursing the baby so I'm burning through calories. I'm starving!  Nearly one hour later (fine.. Not ideal but I can handle that) the food arrives. I'm speechless. Take a look at the picture. The panna cotta is literally a hot mess. Disgusting. The pizza is cold and looks like it was sitting around all day I don't understand what happened here! I live a few blocks from this place. Did the delivery dude do some boxing-week shopping before dropping by with my food? Did the kitchen pack my panna cotta with the pizza? What the bleep!  Regarding the taste of the food, the salad dressing was super sweet. The ingredients themselves I think were actually quite nice.. It was just hard to taste through the dessert-like dressing. The pizza had good components too.. Especially that spicy salami. It was just old by the time it got here.  I wasn't a fan of the frittura mistake, although the dipping sauce was really good. The basil really came through yum yum I'm still dumbfounded by the panna cotta.   Here's the joke: when I'm hungry I go crazy and have super low standards. Time to email the restaurant. Yep, after taxes and tip $70 down the drain. Needless to say, I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"So Sip Wine Bar's been in my neighborhood for several years now, and I only just checked it out. And as it turns out, the place is pretty dang awesome.  We arrived around lunchtime on a Saturday and the joint was almost empty. Our server was friendly and efficient, even though he asked if we wanted complimentary bread. (Like, don't ask! Just bring the bread over and I'll gobble it down. If you ask, I start to feel calorie-conscious and I can't help but say no.)  Anyway, I decided to try the Tagliatelle alla bolognese (\"tagliatelle in a traditional bolognese meat sauce\"). Although I would hardly rank this among the best bolognese sauces I've ever tried - it was missing that deep richness you associate with the very best bolognese - this was a very tasty dish.  The pasta was perhaps just a little overcooked but the plentiful sauce more than made up for it. The meat was cooked well (i.e. it wasn't bouncy) and the tomato sauce was relatively flavorful (and was enhanced by the sprinkling of parmesan and parsley atop the dish).  There are almost too many Italian restaurants in the Yonge and Eglinton area, but Sip Wine Bar definitely deserves its place among them."}
{"text":"Very nice pizza and good service. I was there numerous times during the last three weeks and so far was satisfied on each occasion. Atmosphere is cozy as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistently good. Not amazing, but good. I have eaten here a handful of times since it first opened and have not been disappointed. The gnocchi is decent and the pizzas are great. Prices are reasonable and staff are friendly. Every time I have been they seem to have been out of the meatballs. Wine list is limited for a \"wine bar\"."}
{"text":"I've been to Sip a few times now, and each time has been the exact same: Great food and ambience, absolutely terrible service.    I don't like to be harsh in my reviews against customer service because I know how hard it can be for busy restaurants at peak times but it's just consistently next-level bad here. Each person's meal and wine seems to always come highly spaced out. My friend once waited half an hour for her pasta while the other few of us had been served. Another time, a dinner reservation for 4 people at 7pm resulted in meals and wine coming out at 10pm, and the waitress didn't even come by in that period to let us know what was going on. We did happen to see her continually returning to a table of guys and dangling over them, so we know she was indeed alive and well.  Most infuriatingly, I was here for a birthday dinner and the waitress ignored us for most of the night. We had to hound her down to make our orders, and she walked away after taking wine orders even though we were ready to order food too. The wine took over an hour to arrive and she wouldn't stop to take food orders, so somebody from the table actually had to get up and bring her over for dinner orders, and again it was another hour before dinner was served. i know Friday night service can get hectic, but she wasn't the least bit apologetic or polite, nor did she give us a heads up that it might be a slower evening. We emailed the manager later to explain what happened and it was 3 weeks before a lukewarm acknowledgement (no apology) came back.  The food is tasty and the wine selection is great. The prices are decent and the atmosphere is fun, but that kind of all goes to shit when the staff doesn't let you eat or drink for hours and gives you major attitude. Sadly, I can't get past the awful service and probably won't voluntarily return for a long time."}
{"text":"Sip Wine Bar is the perfect spot for a romantic drinks date in the Yonge and Eglinton area. I can't speak to the food but I've enjoyed a few glasses of wine and good banter with the bartenders on several occasions."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and the first couple of times, the service has been extremely slow, but this past time, we were promptly served. The wine and food is very good, and I enjoy this little spot. It's unpretentious, there are always first dates happening here and it's good for people watching."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant in the Yonge-Eglinton area. I have been here many times and always left feeling happy with the service and a full stomach. Staff is so friendly and I especially like Raimondo who is a very nice charismatic server. He always helps you with recommendations and to pair your food with wine. Sometimes if you're there late just before they close the restaurant offers a thing or two on the house. When it comes to their prices it's not bad. I would say it's decently priced, like most other Italian restaurants.  A great tip is to check Groupon for offers, considering they regularly offer gift vouchers for a highly discounted price! This makes the already decent prices even better! If you are in the Yonge-Eglinton area it's definitely worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, bad service and we went really late after 9 p.m. so no excuse for crap service when four waiters just stood around. Waitress was rude and impatient when I asked her which pizza's better between a couple of choices I was debating on, as she was abrupt and only recommended a spicy one when I kept telling her spicy doesn't matter.  She brought my friend's wine in little glass vase and reached over dishes to pour it quickly into her wine glass already on table then walked off...She didn't pickup the glass and didn't ask my friend to taste it, which is not the norm at other places I've been to.  Pizza had very tiny slivers of prosciutto, lots of cheese and sauce. Flavours weren't bad and I realized it was too salty because of the anchovies so not their fault, but I much prefer other Neapolitan pizza joints.  When we left, an old big woman whom appeared to be an owner at the front didn't say bye and only stared at us rudely.  I'm not impressed and for a $16 pizza before tax so $21 after tax and tip, I don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Very good, very clean and delicious authentic Italian food. Just got back from Italy and this food holds up quite well to the real thing."}
{"text":"As others have griped about, service here is sub par and the food is mediocre. We went for a work lunch, on a Thursday afternoon. Our group was one of four tables in the restaurant at the time, and service was absolutely unacceptable.   Dishes were brought out one at a time, and up to 5 minutes apart. The kitchen staff was lackadaisical, at one point, they proceeded to have a very loud argument, after which one of the kitchen staff went to the bar to hang out for a bit. Adding insult to injury, they completely forgot one of our entrees, (almost 1.5 hours into our lunch at this point). The only way we realized this error was after asking them waitress to check on the last dish. She seemed completely flummoxed about the absent risotto, despite having recommended it. She offered to put in an order, but at that point it simply wasn't worth waiting for.  Although we were not charged for the missing item, there was no other attempt to salvage our experience. There are too many good Italian restaurants immediately surrounding this restaurant for this sub-standard place to stick around. Do yourself a favor, go to Grazie or La Vecchia."}
{"text":"Ordered a Margherita pizza which has 3 toppings; mozzarella, tomato and basil. What a disgrace.  How cheap are you that you can afford more basil? Pizza was cold upon delivery.I called to get it rectified and it was explained basil is a garnish. Isn't that the idea for pizza. You would at least expect each 'garnish' on every slice.  How is this place still open? I will never be ordering from this place.  Also spreading the word. Awful!!"}
{"text":"Sip is my neighbourhood restaurant that I like to go to at least once or twice a month for a descent pizza or pasta. I wouldn't say it is the best pasta or pizza you will taste, but it's cheap and cheerful. One thing that gives them a 4 star for me is Carmen the owner is a sweet man, he always comes around to everyone eating in his restaurant to say hello. My favourites on there menu is their margarita pizza and the grilled lamb, Just Amazing."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once for a meal and once for a drink/snacks in a large group.   For Y&E, the pizza is quite good (Falasca shut down, so this place takes over the reigns).   Besides having good pizza though, this place failed me on various points.   - Service has been poor on both occasions, and surprisingly abrasive. - Price point wise, i'm just not interested. It is no where close in comparison to other quality options but yet they price like they compete. Sad to say, they just don't.  It's sad however, because if they just stopped trying to be pretentious and adjusted their style and price point a bit to be in line with the rest of the neighbourhood, they'd be doing so well, even for not being directly on Yonge."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gnocchi in crema di broccoli e burrata - described as \"Potato dumplings in broccoli and black olive puree finished with chunks of burrata cheese.\" What I got was decent gnocchi drenched in a cheesy oily cream sauce with broccoli without any hint whatsoever of black olives. I only ordered this dish for the black olive puree and was so disappointed when the dish arrived.  The dish was so heavy and greasy that I could not finish it nor bring myself to eat the left overs the next day. My dinner date was equally unimpressed with the Pappardelle al boscaiola, which was also very heavy and greasy.  The ambiance and service were fine. Would return perhaps for wine if I was in the neighbourhood, but definitely not for the pasta."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some pizza on Friday with my husband.  Based off of prior reviews we ordered the bruschetta and Diavola pizza to share.  I was so happy with both options.  The bruschetta is not typical it is mostly tomatoes with seasoning on top of a thick bread. The pizza had huge slices of spicy sausage OMG that sauce was to die for. Closest I have got in a long while to true Italian flavors outside of when I went to Italy.  You get what you pay for here with huge portion sizes. We each got a  glass of wine (I got the house white) which was tart and paired well with my meal.   This place is really good and I would highly recommend you stop in. The lack of a star is due to the slow service and the loudness inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing bruschetta! I have not had a bruschetta like this one before. It was unique in the authentic Italian style. Super yummy! It goes well with their Pino Grigio wine. Their Diavola pizza was good, too but I liked the bruschetta much more. Their portions are big so if you don't eat a lot, you could even share your bruschetta.   Noting their wine bar label, this place would be a good spot to just grab wine and chat with friends as well. Service was excellent but at times it was a little confusing because there were around three to four servers who brought us food, drinks and the bill. I would come back to try different dishes."}
{"text":"I don't care how good or bad a restaurant's food is, if the service is bad, it's a deal breaker. The service here and attitude of the staff were both super disappointing.   I called for a 7pm reservation and they told me 6 or 8 only. Funny enough, not only were they empty when i arrived at 7, but the other member of my party was able to get a 715pm reservation. How? I don't know.  Wine lists are 2 years outdated, so pricing and year of bottle were both wrong. Seriously? I'm no wine snob, and I admit this is a first world problem, but if I'm going to pay you for marked up alcohol, at least do it right and print a current list.  When I arrived, I sat there for about 10 minutes just staring at the wait staff, none of whom came over to ask if I needed anything. Maybe they didn't come over because the other member of my table wasn't there, but at almost every other restaurant I've dined at (a lot of which I go to myself) it's customary to ask someone if they want something to drink.  Food was okay. Small salad and dry pizza. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant was quite nice and had a nice atmosphere. They had opened the patio for the summer. The staff were polite but our server was not very attentive. We ordered the fried calamari and shrimp for appetizers which was very salty.  For mains we ordered mushroom risotto and salmon. The risotto looked runny like a soup and didn't look very appetizing. Also didn't taste good at all. The salmon had a great presentation but was so bland. Whats the point in a pretty place if the food was terrible?! I had a groupon and i told the girl in the before even sitting down but she left for her break and the guy who served us made a tad bit of a fuss which was unnecessary. Also the food were expensive. The bill ended being over $80. Terrible experience"}
{"text":"I've been to SIP twice this month.   The first time blew me away   The second time nearly broke my diner heart   Time #1. On a cold Monday night...  Our waiter was Johnny  Amazing from start to finish, a sweetheart Friendly chap full of charm and jokes  We feasted on warm bread and a compote/butter that rocked my world  Johnny topped up my 5oz wine order (at no extra cost) to match my friend's 7oz (his idea!) The pizza (anduja) was sublime, true neopolitan delight. I think I cried (hot!) We were offered the house (mama's) hot oil which made the pizza even better (more happy tears) The wine suggestions were perfect cause J asked a lot of questions to determine taste Still. The food stole the show! J gave us free lemon shots and a dessert to sample for the kitchen (open concept so the chef watched for our reactions. Heart! Be still!)  We walked away full and content and couldn't wait to come back   So we Didn't. Wait.  Time#2. A balmy Friday night.  Busier, noisier, terrible seating options  The waitress never identified herself (called us Bella for sport and said her husband was one of the chefs. Her name, a mystery) She took FOREVER to even take our orders or offer is water while we waited. I kid you not. A long time by any means. The bread came out stale and cold and the compote was a different one, tasteless store bought stuff  We got the pie and nothing else (the pasta doesn't compare)... But it was cold and not as good or spicy or cheesy as last time  No oil/pepper offered; we asked and got flakes. You know, the pizza pizza kind -_- Wine suggestion was lame, not full bodied as requested   We couldn't get out of there fast enough   It pains me to write this review cause I had drafted this glorious one to share from the first experience but it was countered by this excuse of a dinner we suffered. So   I RECOMMEND- going on a very slow night, when staff and kitchen are not overworked and can cater to you.   EXTRA TIP- Ask for Johnny"}
{"text":"We were just waking by this place on a Friday night and decided to drop by for dinner. Overall the experience was okay, hence the 4 stars. I would like to highlight the seafood pasta, it was incredible!!! Also, we were served by a very nice Italian server. She was great!!"}
{"text":"I got the diavola pizza, which was more than enough for me. My date got the bruschetta, which looked like a pizza with a LOT of tomatoes added on top. The diavola was pretty good and is made in a more traditional Italian style. I do wish they put more salami on it though. The service was decent and the atmosphere is nice for a date night. They have a pretty big selection of wines too."}
{"text":"Nice little spot.Comprehensive wine selections (as you'd expect) and near to our home so that's good. Some rather odd service experiences however: despite being total winos we wanted some cocktails (you could see they had spirits behind the bar). We asked and the sever about making a couple \"Zombies\" and she kinda laughed and said no. I told her I could guide her through the ingredients but it seemed it was going to be quite a burden on her. She said \"we don't really do cocktails\". When pressed a little further however she brought us a cocktail menu! A decent cocktail menu! Fearing the mixes maybe weren't going to be all that fresh due to \"...not really doing cocktails...\" we eventually opted for a Rose Sparkling Wine instead. When the bottle was delivered it was not the kind on the menu. Not even close. The server said \"it's pretty much the same thing...it's a Rose\". Well, it was indeed a Rose and it was pretty good ($45) but it was definitely not the same thing...not even the same Country of origin. Anyway...a little later the Owner came by to ask if we'd sign his petition for a patio (evidently there was one objection to his application). He didn't introduce himself by name so I asked him his name and we were then formally introduced! I signed the petition as it seemed he had plenty of space for a patio and who among us doesn't love a summer patio, right? Funny thing is, we thought perhaps he would express his appreciation of our signing his beloved petition by delivering a small taster of wine or something to that effect; he actually never spoke to us again and didn't even inquire about how we were doing for the rest of the evening. We didn't expect anything but though it lacked some genuine hospitality. Anyway...we ordered dinner: wife had Agnolotti in a cheese and black truffle sauce. It was a little al dante for my tastes but the sauce was very, very good it tasted excellent and my wife loved it! I had the veal chop, medium. It came a little overdone, flavour was OK but the chop itself was pretty tough, no matter how you cut it. And with a garnish of just two one-quarter wedges of a potato with a couple carrots made the sticker price of $27.95 not such great value to be honest. I've heard their pizza's are pretty great. Not sure if we'd go back...maybe if he gets the patio and can make us a couple cocktails?! :)"}
