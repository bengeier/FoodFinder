{"text":"I love that the food court at First Markham Place has a lot more Northern Chinese options now (e.g., Shentian and Northern Kitchen)! Gives me a lot more variety and options for when I'm craving lamb or other regional dishes.   Came here on a Saturday and ordered their pickled vegetable fish soup, which came with a heaping serving of white rice and a choice of sweet soy milk or hot and sour soup (I went for the latter). The total price was $7.99 before tax, which was quite worth it! The entree soup was exactly what I needed - it had the perfect sour kick with some slight spicy undertones. In fact, I found quite a few chili peppers slices with Sichuan peppercorns in my broth. When I tried to finish the pickled vegetables (all nested at the bottom of the soup), I found myself biting into the gritty texture of peppercorns - which were unpleasantly numbing. I also drank a good chunk of the soup without finding it too salty (a sign that not much MSG is used), and I was very happy to find some vermicelli at the bottom of the dish (what a plus!). As always, the fish used was basa fillet, so it wasn't too flavourful but it sure did the job.  For its price, this dish is well worth its value. Can't wait to come again and try some of the other options!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the only other review here is talking about. The food was delicious, not too salty and everything was fresh. The owners are quite nice as well. Prices are reasonable, and the quantity given is much larger than what is offered at the rest of the food court.  I suggest the sweet and sour fish - that was my favorite."}
{"text":"So worth the price (specials are $5-8). The food is good at the person taking orders is so friendly and cheerful. My meal was delicious, I cannot wait to come back again :)"}
