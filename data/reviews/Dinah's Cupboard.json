{"text":"If you work in the area and are tired of the usual for lunch, try Dinah's. Their sandwiches and hot/cold table are so tasty and change daily. And there's always something from the sweet tray to tempt you..."}
{"text":"Pusateri's is for everyone - especially those who try to be 'in the know'. Dinah's is a little something for those who just know. It's been around a while and has changed hands since Dinah Koo was a partner. (For those who would like to continue being in the know, Dinah is one of Toronto's better known chefs.)

I love this cubby hole - it's rickety, with a side of country (countryside not Nashville country). The walls are lined from floor to ceiling with spices, herbs, crackers and other gourmet treats. Everything you need to create an inspired meal. 

From Monday to Saturday they offer different premade foods to meet your lunch and dinner needs, as well as fresh soups, such as cold gazpacho or butternut squash puree. My personal favourite is their teriyaki salmon - never have I met a piece of fish so perfect. They also have a to-die-for lemon butter cake, samosas, apple blueberry scones, biscotti, cookies, brownies...get it? Whatever it is, it tastes right.

P.S. They also seem to have everything - from truffles/truffle oil to vanilla beans to yorkshire tea, etc.  Just enough of what you need at prices you want."}
{"text":"The place has been here for years!!  First opened up by a famous celebrity chef/caterer Dinah Koo, the place is now run by Glen, Cora and her family.   Well, this is what I know of from my last visit there.

If you are down in this area, drop in and say hello to the friendly people there.  They have gourmet everything it seems.  From coffee blends and teas to spices and expensive bottles of balsamic vinegar.  Dinahs' Cupboard IS the original gourmet food store in Toronto.  Full of heritage and history this place is something that needs to be checked out if you call yourself a culinary caper!"}
{"text":"Lots of lunch take-out options, all very fresh and unprocessed. I am conflicted because the prices are high for lunch take-out.

Sometimes I go to Dinah's, look around and don't see anything that catches my eye, but some days, I do. On those days, I always leave at least $10 poorer, but the food is usually worth it and usually satisfies my hunger. Yesterday I tried the chicken stir fry and a side of some steamed green vegetable. The chicken was real chunks of chicken meat and it wasn't drowning in sauce or salt, fresh.

Dinah's also offers lots of interesting gourmet prepared foods, like spices and shortbread cookies (mmm) and jams and chocolate. You can also sit and eat there - there are a couple of tables scattered between the wares. It doesn't look too comfy, but people do it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Its small but has fantastic food. If you dont feel like cooking dinner.... this is the place to go."}
