{"text":"Way overrated, kid at the counter wanted to charge gratuity for an order of 6 or more...really you want to charge gratuity for an order of 6? So instead we ordered individual, you're still gonna have to make the 6 anyway.  Also this establishment is a line up, order and pick up your own food, get your head out of your asses."}
{"text":"If you have not been to Tubby Dog Taco Tuesday, where have you been?!  At 8pm on Tuesdays, Tubby Dog sells tacos for $3 a piece. These tacos are better than most places in the city. Much more authentic, everything is handmade, and you can tell. The meat is well seasoned and tender, the tortillas are fresh and soft, and the taco sauce just adds that extra je-ne-sais-quoi. Definitely a place to check out.  While people are big fans of the A-bomb and the hot dog selection, I personally lean more towards the onion rings. These bad boys are the size of donuts. I would share an order with a friend though, because these will fill you up!"}
{"text":"It was my first experience last night at 11pm and I had the A-bomb. I had found a small piece of clear sharp plastic in the A-bomb. I believe I had ate more pieces which I thought were chips on the dog. It was brought to the attention of the worker's and they didn't have much concern that I found that on the hot dog. The worker picked the plastic out of my chewed hotdog and said he didn't know where it would of came from. If I was a employee than I wouldn't want to be serving anymore food to customers. I left unhappy and went home and at 6 am I woke up and was coughing up a small amount of blood and I had a sore throat and chest pain. If the bleeding got worse than I would have gone to the ER. They are lucky I didn't/ don't follow through with a lawsuit. This place has the worst customer service and I don't recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I lived in Vancouver for two and a half years, with several gourmet hot dog places at my disposal. I didn't even set foot in the door of these places, why? BECAUSE THEY AINT TUBBY DOG!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Tubby Dog for a year now. It's my go to for occasions and meeting up with friends. Hot dogs are more than just hot dogs. They each have their own personality made special just for you.   I always get the A-bomb but I wish I would have tried the Thanksgiving special it looked amazing and it came with a side of Pumpkin Pie. Took my brother for his Birthday dinner here tonight he had the A-bomb to. He loved it.  I actually like that they take cash it reminds me of my other favourite cash only venue Peter's. There's always such a neat mix of people the staff is always friendly and great to talk to. It's hard to go to a venue and find staff who really love their job.  I always leave full but not overly full and I always leave happy."}
{"text":"For all the hype I've heard about this place... eh...  The place was quite flithy and the staff just seemed very uninterested (Also looked like they were both wasted, there were quite a few half consumed beer bottles not hidden very well and saw them swig a few times while cooking.) Attempted to order Onion Rings, \"We're all out\" at 2pm? What on earth? This was on a Tuesday as well. Had the A Bomb dog, very... lackluster for the price. Maybe it's because I'm not overly a major fan of hot dogs or I just didn't \"get\" what makes Tubby Dog so popular, it's a shame. I did want to enjoy visiting after hearing so much but... this was a disappointment."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our son to Tubby dog as a birthday treat. We went around noon when it just opened and there was lots of parking out front. I thought it might be pretty busy but we were able to get a table without much trouble. There aren't many tables though so be prepared to sit at the counter.  It was the first time there for all of us despite living in the city for many years. My husband and I both got the Tubby dog which is basically a really good chili dog. My little guy got a Cap'ns Dog (PB and Jam with Captain Crunch).  We all really enjoyed them. I was surprised how good the Cap'ns Dog was. The peanut butter is all melty which really makes it."}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has reviewed this yet! This place is fucking awesome. Okay so, let's say you're walking down 17th and got a hankerin' for a hotdog, you pop into tubby dog and you have hit the motherload. Different sizes of dogs plus something like 42 different toppings to choose from. You could get a PBJ dog if you wanted (I've heard it's popular amongst drunk patrons). Plus they serve beer and have good fries, what more can you ask for? Totally having my wedding reception here."}
{"text":"Hot Diggity Dog! - No city can claim to be a metropolis until it has a hot dog joint that borders on absurdity. Tubby is this place, it has kitschy charm, Sunday movie nights, and cleverly named tube steaks. The dawgs are pricey, but are heaped with every and anything imaginable. They're great to marvel at, but a little daunting to eat, the pile of toppings almost detract from the taste of the encased meat. Without all the condiments, however, you'd be just eating at Orange Julius. French Fox, Guru, the Boy, and I went hard: Jr. Harlo, couple of A-Bombs and Tubbys, and the featured V-Train (look at the accompanying pic, my fingers would break off attempting to list all the ingredients). Surprisingly, no intestinal havoc ensued later in the night. Strap on a bib, grab an utensil, gather up a bunch of cash, and get your street meat fix at TB."}
{"text":"This place is a DIVE.  I went here and i got the tubby dog and it had onions mustard chili and cheese. It was awesome. Only problem was that, it was 10 bucks and the venue was filthy."}
{"text":"The joint was styled like an old school diner with a walk up ordering style. It was definitely a very relaxed atmosphere. Luckily we came in just before the rush.  After a bit of deliberation we ordered:  A-BOMB - cheese, bacon, mayo, mustard, ketchup & potato chips CHEETAH - sauerkraut, cheese, mustard, & relish SUMO - japanese mayo, wasabi, pickled ginger, seaweed salad & toasted seaseme seeds  We also ordered yam fries to share and a big 'ol coke to wash it down!   I ordered the sumo dog and was incredibly surprised at how light it was. I know, \"light\" wasn't exactly the word I thought I'd be using to describe this dog. I was expecting something more greasy and heavy - even with the other two dogs we ordered. Surprisingly each dog was not at all greasy and there was a perfect ratio of dog to bun.   There was a lovely kick from the wasabi that added a good amount of heat to the sumo dog and the pickled ginger really helped cut the meatiness of the dog and gave you a break from the odd texture of hotdog and seaweed salad, together. For anyone thats had a Japadog from Vancouver before - this is very similar. Hands down the sumo was a favourite. The A-Bomb, reminded me of the dogs I use to get when I was going to McMaster, but I use to add jalapeno peppers to mine! The cheese & chips, I thought might have been over kill but once I had a bite I realized it was just enough to coat the dog but not overwhelm it. The Cheetah was an in-between-er for me. If I had not gotten the sumo or tried the a- bomb, I would have enjoyed this more. But up against the previous two dogs, this one just didn't sing as loud. Lyssa loved it though and I could tell they were very generous with the sauerkraut.  We also ordered the yam fries on the side and even with big eaters like the three of us, it was way too much to handle! Should have gone for the half order. It came with sweet chilli sauce on the side which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Sooo gooooood. Soooooooooooo GOOOOOOOOOOOD!*      *Don't eat sober."}
{"text":"I have never looked at hot dogs as a crazy food. I'm used to the regular ketchup, mustard, relish and onion but this place completely changed my view.  The restaurant is very retro style with a ton of arcade games and old school decoration. The music and vibe was really cool and everybody seemed to be having a great time. The menu was crazy with a ton of weird flavored like peanut butter and Captn Crunch. I decided to go with the monthly special which was a hot dog with crimped fries, gravy and cheese curds. I was a little shocked at the price however when my total for one hot dog and one large coke was $17. The hot dog was ready within 5 minutes and it looked AMAZING.  I took one bit and was shocked that a hot dog could taste this good. Perfectly grilled with a nice soft yet crunchy bun. I will however warn that you cannot eat this hot dog with your hands, you have to use the utensils.   I have to give this place a 4 simply for such a high price tag for a hot dog. It wasn't like there was a mountain of poutine on top of my hot dog so it wasn't worth $11. Other than that the food and the experience was fantastic!!! I would love to stay longer in Calgary to try the other toppings."}
{"text":"I will keep this as brief as possible, If you are looking for a good value and tasty hot dog, this is the place for you.  My personal favourite is the Slaw Dog although I am yet to try any of the specials they do as they are a bit more expensive.  The fries and pop are a really good value. For the fries and sweet potato chips I would recommend only getting a half tray for 2 people and a full tray for 4 as the portion size is very generous.  The place has a nice retro dinner feel although sometime I do feel like the place is a bit 'sticky' and could do with a good clean!"}
{"text":"I don't think I need to explain the concept of this place as everyone else has.  And the hot dogs are good! Too bad the service is AWFUL and I'm constantly told they don't have something (the bottled coke one day, cherries another day). Everyday they seem to be out of something."}
{"text":"I remember when this place opened, something different than pizza at 2am after going to the bar. Its got a kitschy decor and some interesting hot dog combos..never had the guts to try the Capt'n Crunch Dog, or Wasabi Dog, dont think I ever will..so my usual is Choose your Own Adventure or the A Bomb. THey onions rings are massive..and are a bit darker than standard A & W esque rings, I find they ont have much flavour. The yam fries or maybe more similar to wedges? are pretty good though. They are VERY HOT when served, so be careful."}
{"text":"I love that they have vegetarian dogs.  They're well grilled, large and yummy.  What I don't like is how they're served.  The dogs are so heavily topped it's impossible to eat them without getting stuff all over your clothes.  I work on the avenue and so when I visit, it's for lunch.  I want to eat my lunch, not wear it.  Also, all that stuff overwhelms the taste of the dog, which is actually really good.  I get around this by telling the person taking my order to go easy on the toppings and to make sure they all fit inside the bun.  Most of the staff can handle this and I end up with a delicious veggie dog.  (I like mine with coleslaw and potato chips.)  There's one idiot working there though, with big dorky glasses who can't seem to manage this.  Whenever I order he says, \"That's not the way we make 'em man.\"  (I'm a woman.)  Then gives me a stupid overloaded dog.  If I see him at the counter I go elsewhere for my lunch."}
{"text":"Well, they're trying. What exactly, I'm not sure. The decor is cool, I guess, and if you like peanut butter and Cap'n'crunch on a hot dog, this is the place to go. But it seems they only offer these crazy toppings to cover up the taste of the actual hot dog you're paying for. The dog I had came loaded with cheese and bacon and onions, but the dog itself was terrible. The skin (??) on it was tough and it was actually hard to cut with my teeth. It was like a poorly cooked smokie. They say you can get it grilled though, so that's what I'll do if I go back. They should also give a list of toppings to choose from so you're not spending five minutes trying to determine them from behind the sneeze guard, which they made me feel was really bothering them. Ah, if you're drunk, it doesn't matter anyway, right?"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to stop after a night of beer and punk rock. Great dogs, especially the Sumo. Yam fries are fantastic. And if you get a chance, it's a great venue for small, sweaty rock shoes.  I was there for the Monotonix show - were you???"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I was falling over drunk, I could immediately tell that the veggie dog (\"Japanese\"-style) was one of the Top Five Worst Food Items I Have Ever Consumed.  It made me long for the delicacies of Tiraspol, Transnistria.  On the plus side, the food was so bad it had my friend and I in a fit of giggles until we finally threw the hotdogs away.  Depressed?  Feeling down?  Tubby Dog might just put a smile on your face, but for all the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time on our way back home. I had the A-Bomb, boyfriend had the Cheetah, sausage weren't cooked properly, still cold inside when served. Probably won't go there again:("}
{"text":"This place is perfection.   Their range of weird and wonderful toppings accompanies what are quite possibly the best hot dogs in the world. Nothing beats bringing someone here for their first time and watching them try and figure out how to actually eat these monstrosities.  My personal favourites are the A-Bomb - one of their signature dogs piled high with potato chips, space cheese, and bacon bits - and the Sumo - a bizarre coupling of hot dogs with Japanese ingredients like pickled ginger and seaweed salad. When their pizza dogs are offered, they absolutely can't be missed.   The sides come in portions as ridiculous as the hot dogs, with small orders of fries (both sweet potato and regular potato) being more than enough for two people. Their onion rings resemble donuts more than anything else.   As for the restaurant itself, you've gotta be a fan of kinda tacky dives. Typically a projector is playing old cartoons, the walls are lined with displays of retro food, and a number of classic arcade machines are found around the place.   This is a Calgary institution, and should be visited by everyone."}
{"text":"I guess everything changes once you get on tv. Food sucks don't waste your money. Calgary has a lot of great places to eat. Tubby Dog is NOT one of them!"}
{"text":"Went here last night, hadn't been for a while, won't be going back. Ordered 2 dogs, and onion rings, only to get told RUDELY that they were out. Come on, Tubby Dog, running out of one of your signature items?? That's like starbucks running out of coffee. Dogs were so-so. Felt a little blah after eating mine, and my buddy felt the same. I woke up this morning, and spent a wonderful 2 hours hugging my toilet, and found out later, the same thing happened to my buddy. Pretty sure the t-dog was to blame...... But, like every vice I have, I'll likely be back......"}
{"text":"We tried the Captain Crunch dog as well as the traditional tubby dog. Our expectations were high, and they were not met. Although the Ukrainian dog itself was delicious, the combination with sweet was underwhelming and the grape jelly was not great (a jelly with a tangy flavour would have been better). We also took away points because it was extremely difficult to eat and the bread was stale.  We were also put off by the very loud music and general uncleanliness of the place.   This could've been so good, but just didn't quite make the mark."}
{"text":"Try the specials.  You either love it or hate it, but if you like hot dogs there is something for everyone (like a vegetarian Not Dog). Bob-a-dogg II still holds one of my fondest memories, and I'm eager to try the latest creation, as I know I'll be in for an adventure. These dogs can be messy, so it may be a good idea to pick up some utensils before you start."}
{"text":"You can't come to Calgary and not stop in at Tubby Dog. The best part is its in a great location to walk around. So once you're down plowing through that enormous hot dog delight you can walk it off! Or at least feel like you have.  I give it four stars though because seating could be better to allow more people to sit down and eat. I wouldn't attempt to take one of these bad boys outside to try and eat. The other reason is I went there three weeks ago and it was within the posted hours yet there were to signs on the door one said \"open\" one said \"closed\" the door was locked. So reluctantly I headed over to the Big Cheese for a very mediocre substitute. When I returned to my car Tubby Dog was back in business door wide open and everything. #notimpressed"}
{"text":"There isn't too many places in Calgary that you can honestly say give you the full package -- but Tubby Dog does.  Where else can you see a local rock band, eat space cheese and ketchup chip-topped hot dogs and yam wedges, play vintage arcade games, watch cheesy B-movies and cartoons, run into a lot of your friends, drink beer and/or glass bottled Coca Cola, people watch in the open window during the summer, look at cool pop art on the walls, and the staff is really awesome?  I am thinking the only place is Tubby Dog.  Awesome Awesome Awesome!"}
{"text":"Tubby dog is like a friend you only want to see a few times a year. The dogs are good but the service is horrible. You're usually ignored while waiting to order while the staff fraternize with each other. As long as you enter the building knowing that you will have the shittiest service ever then its fine"}
{"text":"Love this place, from the decor to the great hot dogs.  Bacon wrapped goodness with awesome chilli and bacon bits.  I wouldn't consider it inexpensive tho, it does cost a bit for a hot dog but worth the price.  Open late too.  They do have different events that are hosted, i walked in one night to find a street fighter tournament going on.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The onion rings here suck. They're terrible. They try to be Southern by double frying them, but they end up being Canadian (i.e., bland) because flavor and transfats are outlawed by our government."}
{"text":"Apparently you actually can eat irony.  Tubby dog serves several different themed hot dogs perhaps the most unusual is 'The Captain's Dog' which includes, of course, a hot dog (or a veggie dog if you are of the persuasion) peanut butter, jelly (the flavor escapes me though) and a generous handful of Captain Crunch cereal. The staff and the patrons are largely part of the scenester Varity but don't hold that against them because they actually do serve up a decent hot dog and keep an eye on the notice board because every once in a while they will play a retro or cult movie on one of the back walls."}
{"text":"This place is definitely missing a roller rink. It's all old-timey sort of smelling/atmosphere with a lot of new built into it, like a projector which plays anything the staff feels like putting on (during Comic Expo it was a retro Star Trek cartoon) and arcade machines. I ordered the \"Tubby Dog\". It was... alright... but I wasn't feeling so great afterwards. Probably the grease... it's my own fault anyway. Cash only."}
{"text":"Best damn place for a hot dog. Come here quite often when my boyfriend and I need a super delicious dinner. And better yet with a beer ! If you haven't tried any then get down to 17 ave and get yourself a tasty dog"}
{"text":"No doubt the decor is fun and retro.  I just feel the fix-ins dominate the dog and can't help but think that it should be the other way around.  The wieners are ok, but I've had much better quality sausages from regular stands in downtown Calgary (and for cheaper too).  Nothing against cheese wiz, chili, bacon or Doritos, it just doesn't feel right in a hot dog.  Give me a quality sausage over excess fix-ins any day.  Fun place though."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this interview by saying that I'm not crazy about hot dogs. They are okay, and I enjoy them at baseball games, but not too often otherwise. On the other hand, my 87 year old grandmother LOVES them, so I figured it was worth bringing her out to this location to enjoy some dog.   Upon arrival the staff was very nice, and the place was full of younger kids (college aged). I ordered the strange asian dog, my grandmother ordered something plain with loads of grilled onions, and we split some fries.   The dogs were awesome, the asian dog was very tasty and unique. The fries were really good, and the half order was massive, no way we could finish them. This place is very reasonably priced and great.   I would give it 5 stars if I really liked hot dogs, but it was once of the better ones I've had in my limited hot dog experiences."}
{"text":"Very interesting spot. It's hard to justify a $8-10 hotdog but they try their best. Has a lot of cool retro video/arcade games and what not. Wish it was a bit cleaner in there but I guess that would take away from the grungy atmosphere. I dunno i guess I'm just not that into hot dogs haha."}
{"text":"Tubby Dog is a ridiculous hipster hangout with campy decor and weird toppings for hot dogs. Last time I was there, which was, admittedly, over a year ago, they served Tofurky dogs as their veggie dog - if this is still the case, I appreciate that they're bigger than the average tofu dog, but I really prefer tofu dogs without funky spices. That said...  My dog is a stripe of wasabi and peanut butter and jam melting on top. Incredible. Nobody ever believes me, but it is."}
{"text":"I can only go maybe once or twice a year because it always makes me feel like a nap after the huge hot dog I force myself to finish, but it's so worth it. I love the look of the place, the decorations are awesome and I love the cartoons they play on the projector. I haven't been to an event there yet, but I'd like to go sometime. The hot dogs are delicious. The fries are delicious. This place is awesome, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not exactly the best hot dogs or poutine in the world but not the worst either. Still the price seemed out of whack and high but that's likely because if location.  Likely would not go back."}
{"text":"I have to say, the TV Show \"You Gotta Eat Here\" got there at the right time. This place is beat to crap. The inside is so worn out that it's screaming for a renovation. I got flashbacks from the 80s when I came in which was cool but I wasn't happy to see the selection of seating - ripped vinyl benches, wobbly tables and a front counter with massive wear spots.   As for the food, well it was alright. I wasn't blown away by the hotdog and onion rings. The dog I got had decent coleslaw on it but for a place that specializes in hotdogs, I was expecting the actual link of sausage to be the crown jewel. Instead it was lost in the mess of toppings.   I'm not sure what else there is to say about this place. Maybe it closes down or revives itself? There is potential but I fear that they are just riding the wave of the TV publicity and couldn't care less about the quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"Affordable eats that fill you right up to the top, and you'll have a gas while you're there perusing the hot dog related memorabilia and catching up with old cartoon pals.  The cafeteria tray FULL of fresh sliced fries is one of my all-time favourite indulgences here. . . but the dogs really take the cake.  Outrageously stuffed with toppings, I insist on foregoing a knife and fork (although most who are faint of heart would likely cling to them for support) roll up my sleeves and tuck in. The beer selection is eclectic and spot on."}
{"text":"I'm giving Tubby Dog 5 stars based on the fact that because of the ingenious idea behind this business, Calgary is known across the country.  When I lived in Toronto, any time I'd mention that I had moved from Calgary, people would instantly make reference to Tubby Dog. It was quite shocking to me that Tubby Dog is that notorious, but it is! Even coworkers who would travel to Calgary for a variety of shoots would make it a point to have at least one stop in at Tubby Dog.  With a variety of hot dogs that even your wildest dreams cannot muster up, Tubby Dog is a true gem in our city. Although I personally do not frequent it often, I recognize that it's as popular with locals as it is with tourists.   Not only does Tubby Dog build a mean hot dog, but they build character in our city and for that they get 5 stars hands down."}
{"text":"The place looked worn out and the food was anything but fresh (almost nasty!). I guess the hype wasn't real..."}
{"text":"Tubby Dogs is known for their great dog combinations but you must eat in on Wednesdays and do their burger Wednesday with fries. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, purple onion and cheese compliment this very tasty burger. Death of a cow never tasted so good :)"}
{"text":"BEST F-IN HOT DOGS EVER!!!  Huge. Messy. Unbelievably good. The PERFECT 3am noms.  Try their Slaw Dog. Huge, with a heaping helping of coleslaw and cheese on it, and a giant pickle for garnish.  Or their classic Tubby Dog. Huge, with a heaping serving of chili, bacon, mustard, cheese, etc.  Or maybe their Sumo. Huge, with piles of seaweed, wasabi mayo, pickled ginger. Wacky, but it works.  And when you're feeling particularly adventurous, try the PBJ. My personal favourite. It is exactly what it sounds like, a huge tubby dog slathered with.. you guessed it, peanut butter and jelly. Topped with Cap'n Crunch. Fellow 3am partyers, this is as good as it gets. If you like peanut butter, this is the best hot dog that you'll ever have the pleasure of biting into. It's so good it makes me wish the already giant hot dog was even bigger so this PBJ journey would never have to end. This tubby dog will make you want to lick the styrofoam container clean.  During the day you can walk into their establishment, have a seat at a table with forks and knives and all, and pretend to be civilized. But you will eventually give up because there is no being civilized with forks and spoons when it comes to eating a tubby dog. At some point during the night, they close their doors and only keep a takeout window open until around 3am I believe. Thats when lineups form, and the crowds stumble over to the streets, the wooden benches, the sidewalks, etc with their tubby dogs in styrofoam containers. Post-partying booze-and-tubby-dog-fuelled late night revelry at its best.  A Calgary classic. That's it that's all."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs! When my buddy was living here and told me about the Captain's Dog...in all honesty, it first sounded disgusting. A hot dog, with peanut butter and jelly and Captain Crunch...but it works so wonderfully. It's delicious. Amazing."}
{"text":"Fabulous for a late night snack that you might regret in the morning - but never at the time! These HUGE dogs are great although all kinds of unhealthy. Perfect for a treat or when looking to fill the greasy void. I highly suggest the signature 'Tubby Dog' with chili and bacon and cheese - how can you go wrong?!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to indulge. I had their pizza dog on special and it was glutton amazing. Quick service and friendly staff. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Like anyone even needs to wrtie a review about tubby dog. But i'm going to anyway. i don't know how to explaint he simple addiction I have to this place. The worst part? Now that I livein vancouver I feel like part of my eating lifestyle is broken.  These guys make a sick dog. Its just so perfect and so awesome you have to try it yourself to understand the unique quality they provide. It will enrich your life, actually it will change your life!  please bring a Tubby dog to Vancouver!!!!"}
{"text":"I once wandered in to Tubby Dog after Beer Fest, extremely drunk and craving EVERYTHING. You know the feeling. You also know the after \"Oh my God, I can't believe I ate an entire tub of butter last night\" feeling the morning after.   Tubby Dog serves Tofurky sausages under the name \"Not Dogs\" and you can get them served whichever way they do the meat versions on the menu :). Unfortunately, twice now I have gone to Tubby Dog and have gotten served a sad, leathery Tofurky sausage both times. Come on, Tubby Dog! Not Dogs don't need that much time under the heat!   However, the Yam Chips were awesome and I inhaled half a tray. Next time, I'll know just to order those :)."}
{"text":"This is genius.  Tubby Dog.... Is it because I'm a Tub for eating it, or I'll be Tubby for eating here? I bet it's because the dog is Tubby ... For me it's I'll be Tubby after one bite but who the hell can resist this beautiful bountiful plump juicy cylindrical mound of meat topped with all the fabulous fixings your hearts desire... NO ONE CAN, if you do you are not a normal human being. You're probably some elite superficial level 7 vegan. LOL I'm joking I used to be a vegetarian and my sister is a vegan so it's all jokes.  I have been here many times before, actually every time I'm in Calgary or passing through I make it a habit to always stop in.   The decor is nostalgic, brings me back to when I was a kid and watched movies and shows back in the good old 80's.   Ok to the Dogs, I have tried the Red Baron, Sumo, and Tubby Dog. All have been very tasty.  The only reason I took off a star is because of parking. Parking sucks :)"}
{"text":"I came. I saw. I ate. I'm in LOVE! What's with Canada and their dogs?!   I've heard a lot about Tubby Dog from my Cousins and finally got to eat one, the A Bomb to be exact. Let it be known that I'm not a fan of hot dogs, but when you add great toppings it's a little hard not to like it. Cheese, mayo, mustard, ketchup, BACON, crumbled chips . . . what a great combo. This was a knife and fork dog. I'm also not a fan of yam fries, but they do it well here too. It came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Calgary so I can have another Tubby Dog. I'm trying to figure out how to make my own A Bomb at home, not sure how successful it'll be but it'll have to do until my next trip."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and the crew seem to really enjoy their jobs. We had the A Bomb and Sherms Ultimate Gripper. They were both really yummy - AND I HATE HOTDOGS! Must have been all the cheese sauce. Also, the A Bomb had ketchup chips, my fav. Not sure if they change up the flavours or not but regardless we enjoyed it and will definitely go back. Yummy onion rings as well!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Tubby Dog. A large serving of heart attack isn't always the best thing in the middle of the day or even at 3 in the morning, but it sure is fun! Maybe not the best food I've ever had in my life (or even one day, after breakie at Diner Deluxe), but as a vegetarian in cattle country, I'll take anyone up on an offer for tasty veggie dogs. Or the opportunity to eat chips with mustard, ketchup and relish and not get wierd looks (everyone else is focusing on not getting 'dog all over themselves). Or wasabi and horseradish. Or PB&J and Cap'n Crunch on a hot dog.   Come on, you know your tastebuds want an adventure after all the prairie food.  Remember to bring cash unless you want to get suckered out of $2.50 by the cash machine in the back."}
{"text":"Tubby Dog, a \"gourmet\" hot dog establishment.  While that concept may not work in California, it appears to be alive and well in Calgary thanks to Tubby Dog. Their hot dog links are really big, as is the buns that enclose the hot dog.  I ordered the A-Bomb, the toppings were piled high.   Yam Fries are freshly fried, and cut in whole oblong pieces, rather than in typical \"fry\" shape.    It was unusually warm in Calgary that day.  They utilized the \"Open Window\" method rather than AC.  Be warned, this place is cash only.  Bathroom reasonably maintained."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs ever.  Best restaurant/pub/whatever ever.  Go at night, drink beer, eat hot dogs, watch Tin Tin on the projector and listen to Fordinho spin.  Trust me.  Also, eat the yam fries."}
{"text":"On our way through Calgary, we had two places to hit: Earth Gems and Tubby Dog.   What a wonderful surprise it was to find that Tubby Dog is actually on TOP of Earth Gems. Yes! Only need to find parking once!  The tales of Tubby Dog have made me salivate for years, and it was finally time to dig in and see if all the hype was legit.  These dogs are delicious. The key is the fact they aren't afraid to pile on the toppings, which are then steamed (They key to any amazing hot dog) to gooey-cheesed, soft-bunned perfection.   I like the divey feel to this place - you're not visiting for long, and it's laid back with no pretense - the way a hot dog joint SHOULD be.   Bonus points for the fact that they were playing \"The Birds\" on the back wall, and they have pinball machines to keep you occupied while your waiting for your tasty dog.  Next time we're trying the Cap'n Crunch dog. Can't wait."}
{"text":"You've gotta go!  Super-dogs.  Yam fries by the trayfull!  Onion rings the size of bagels.  Vintage cartoons projected onto the wall.  Giant pops.  I recommend the A-Bomb w/ a Red Stripe.  Just remember - CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Great place, awesome atmosphere and friendly staff! The hot dogs we had aere enormous and tasty"}
{"text":"Ate here, got home, lost my husband to the washroom for over an hour now. Hmmmm, not so good I would say, we are not feeling the best at the moment and I only had a couple of bites of his dog! Not my type of cuisine but we had to try it, right? I really think it is more of a guy thing! 9pm, Wed night, not too busy and no line. Got seating as well inside. Sooooo, you go in, pick your dog from the wall menu or make your own dog. First time here so we went with 1 Tubby Dog. Observations - bun, steamed fresh, amazing. Unless you are from the Honey Boo Boo family, you eat your dog with a knife and fork here. So loaded. There is virtually no cheese on it which was good for me and my 2 bites as I do not like processed anything. The chili is not good - compared to mine - but if you are not picky, you will like this on your dog for the protein/bean factor. Get bacon on it for sure!!! Extra onions were needed, we forgot to ask. Weenie was boiled. I was surprised as I imagined that it would have had more of a crunch to it, a nice snap bite, grilled but I am almost sure it was boiled, ick. I prefer the ball park weenies at the games if I have to eat one at all. The 2 guys behind the counter were great. You order, sit and wait and they call you forward for pickup. Eclectic crowd in here, enjoyed the experience of something different. Side note - why the hell we did not order the delicious looking hand cut fries? $7 per dog."}
{"text":"The guys that work there are not friendly at all. The music is way to loud. There is also barely anywhere to sit. The hotdogs are suppose to be a good quality meat but tastes like plastic, not worth the price. Would not go again or recommend ever. 0/10."}
{"text":"First off, Tubby Dog is DELICIOUS. Like, you can do whatever toppings, but the hot dog itself is super tasty. Now, they PILE the toppings on, so be prepared to have a messy meal, but definitely worth it.  I went with my boyfriend, and he told me that they also do Taco Tuesdays and Burger Wednesdays which is super cool! Furthermore, once in a while they'll have cartoons or movies playing or a live band on \"stage\". They also have about 12 arcade games to play!  The only criticism I might have is that the place definitely needs renovating as the booth seats are ripped and worn, and the tables don't get cleaned as often as they should be."}
{"text":"Tubby Dog is a very special place in Calgary. I have been dropping in here regularly since it opened in 2005 and I don't see that changing anytime soon. It's a must-go every time I come back to visit the city.  Some of the options sound really weird but are actually surprisingly tasty. Take a risk and try the PB&J dog some time! My personal favourite alternative topping would have to be potato chips. I love having that extra crunch on my hot-dog. However, I almost always go with the sumo when I go here. It is a hot-dog (I go with the meatless dog) topped with seaweed, ginger, wasabi, and Japanese mayo. Deeeeelicious!  The last time I went here I was surprised to find out that they now have taco Tuesdays and burger Wednesdays. The veggie tacos are fantastic! They also now take credit cards for payment and offer delivery services. I don't know if I would ever get it delivered. Half the fun of Tubby Dog is the atmosphere, however I'm sure this will be helpful for many other people.  Speaking of the atmosphere? It's awesome. Picture a grungy (in a good way) 50s diner with arcade games lining the walls. What's better to follow your hot-dog than a game of pinball??"}
{"text":"I LOOOOVE the ol' Tubby Dog I had the Peanut butter Jelly and captain crunch dog once, and I remember it was surprisingly good. But there more sane dogs are for sure delicious"}
{"text":"Don't really see the draw to be honest. Tasty and fun combos, but at the end of the day it was still mediocre hotdogs on mediocre buns. They had an awful metal band in for live music, and I had to scream into the staff member's ear to place the order"}
{"text":"atmosphere wins out.  awesome style and music.  now about the food.  crazy dogs.  single traditional weiner prepared how you like it or pick one of the specials.  i had the gripper; everything on it including a fried egg.  this was after being wrapped in bacon deep fried slathered with chili, bacon bits, ham, peppers and onions.  topped with cheese.  just cause i ordered the 1/2 of fries (home cut); only complaint need to fry them twice to get them completely cooked inside and crispy outside (still worth the order).  they also serve beer."}
{"text":"Screw forks. When faced with the absolute ridiculousness of a Tubby Doc, real wo(men) use hands only.  During my last day in Calgary, I had to find a local legend. It looked ridiculous when I drunkenly walked by it, but was even more ridiculous when I walked in sober.  My bro went all out and got Sherm's Ultimate Gripper (scary) and I got the A-Bomb (less scary). Check out my photos for the ridiculous visuals. (Notice how many times I've said ridiculous so far?)  They steam the buns and dogs, but you can ask for grilled. I chose the regular. I was never a fan of processed nacho cheese (ok I lie, as a kid it rocked), but it goes perfect with these dogs. And the crumbled ketchup chips on top rocked.   My bro didn't know how to start with the Gripper. It was daunting. He tried a fork & knife for a second and gave up. Hands only my man.  Tip: stock up with a pile of napkins before you touch your dog. You'll need a tree's worth to clean up.  Watch out Japadog."}
{"text":"If you're a local, you've heard of this place before, or you've been here before. You either love it or hate it, and there's really no in between. I'm in the love it camp.   If you walk by or walk in, you'll probably wonder what the deal is. It's far from anything fancy. It's an old diner with a couple bar stools at the window and a few tables along the back walls. Some old cartoon is probably playing on the TV, and there's a handful of vintage arcade machines plugged in, waiting for your quarters. It's all part of the charm.   Tubby Dog hosts some of the best and by-and-far the messiest meals in Calgary. Don't show up here  looking for fancy, show up wearing something you can get a few mustard stains on. The menu is posted on the back wall, so you'll order at the counter, and please bring cash, if you can. The options range from a plain hot dog, to dogs with chili, to those with peanut butter or cereal on top. Specials include pizza dogs (which are to die for), and monstrous creations based around people or events taking place in the city. If you're new, try the A-Bomb - a gigantic hot dog with space cheese and crushed potato chips that will challenge your opinion on whether or not a hot dog can really be the only thing on your dinner plate.   Other menu items besides the hot dogs include potato chips (fresh and in large enough portions to feed a table), onion rings (large enough to be mistaken for doughnuts), a few cheap beers, and Coke products.  Everything is reasonably priced, and it's the perfect place to take that weird, hipster, out-of-town friend who's tried everything.   Besides the food and decor, the staff is usually really friendly, and the place is open late for those drinking-adventure cravings you might get late at night. One thing to be aware of  is that the restaurant can be closed on occasion to give the staff time off, or open up a bit later \"just because\", so it's worth taking a look to see if they've posted anything to that effect  on their Twitter or Facebook account.   Overall, it's one of the cornerstones of Calgary's food culture, and I recommend and suggest it to anybody who hasn't been there yet."}
{"text":"Either you're going to love Tubby or hate them. I for one LOVE tubby. But like a terrible old flame, I hate being coaxed into Tubby because each hot dog is approx 10000 calories. When I plug this into myfitnesspal/calorie counter app, my phone shuts down.  Allright that was a little overdramatic, but trips to Tubby are rare because I live down south and only chance visits here post-bar or post-anything where I really want to shove something packed with flavour into my mouth.  The last time I was here I got the staple Tubby and the Sumo. The Tubby has always recieved mixed reviews. Either you or your friends will love it in a drunken frenzy, or if you and your companion are enjoying a lovely night like a pair of vacationing retirees and complain about it's overwhelming singe of onion and messy sin of chilli.   Now the sumo dog...it is amazing. This city lacks Vancouver's Japadog and the Sumo dog is the answer to that call. The japanese mayo, ginger, seaweed, and wasabi are packed into this formidable RIKISHI. It's not a heavy, loud, and messy dog like the Tubby, but it packs a lot of flavour.  The decor of Tubby itself makes coming here a great night out. WIth a pocket full of quarters, you can enjoy their retro video game machines or you can instagram the night away by snapping up pictures of their neat displays."}
{"text":"Hot dogs served with a heaping helping of quirk! Yellow floor, bright red vinyl couch, yellow tables and a giant assortment oddball pop culture paraphernalia keep you company while you chomp down on a hot dog decorated with toppings as unusual as the staff's music selection. Have a hankering for a pickled egg?   They have a takeout window that stays open late. If you're feeling wobbly after last call you can stumble down 17th ave and snag yourself a sausage.  I'm a fan of the A-Bomb - topped with bacon, cheese and chips in all its gluttonous glory, but there are many creative options and of course you can always \"choose your own adventure.\"   Tubby Dog is a one of a kind hot dog shop in Calgary. Regardless of your regular diet, I highly recommend you give this place a try and play some pinball while you're there."}
{"text":"You walk into this place and look at the menu. What the bloody hell you say! Who would ever have a hotdog with chip, cheese, bacon, mayo, and so on? Or even sushi fixins?! To that I say, fortune favors the bold, and you'll be duly rewarded for giving this place a chance. Then again, if you don't want to try any of their \"weird\" selections, you can always do a custom order and stick to your figurative bread and butter. Conversely, there's the other side of the coin where you try as many combinations as you like!  The dogs themselves are fine in my book, after repeat orders, I've had only one occasion where I was disappointed. That was with D'Jewel's Ultrafine, but that was because I figured I can do my own dog with sriracha, mustard, and horseradish mayo (and have!) Besides, when is the wiener the most important part anyway? Just as clothes make the man, it's the dressing that makes the hot dog palatable in the first place.  It's a relaxing place to sit in, listen to some songs you haven't heard in ages or ever, and the staff are actual humans, not fake plastic smiles. It doesn't bother me too much that they're hipsters, but some of my best friends are hipsters."}
{"text":"Just finished up my Tubby Dog I may have made a mess as mine had chips on it....and I loved it! I would highly recommend this place to anyone on 17th ave or visiting like we are.  The only downside being that it is cash only. Good we had cash on us which I usually don't carry it."}
{"text":"Amazing after-bar food and a retro movie night on Monday's."}
{"text":"My husband was enamored by this place during his last solo visit to Calgary and insisted that I try it out with him while we were there together. I was pretty skeptical as I'm not normally a huge fan of hotdogs, but this place really lived up to the hype. 10$ seemed a little steep to me for one hot dog at first, but they are extremely filling and well loaded with goodies. My husband had the Captain's Dog I think? With peanut butter and captain crunch. Surprisingly it was really good (though extremely messy). I had the one with ginger and japanese mayo, which was spicy and delicious. Really cool little place, I can see why it's such a Calgary staple."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for years from bands who've headed down from Edmonton to play one of Tubby Dog's free shows and stuff themselves with gigantic, topping-heaped dogs.   I finally got the chance to try one firsthand last weekend when I went down with a couple musicians. Being Thanksgiving weekend, the weekly special was called \"The Gobbler\": a turkey dog covered in mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy, and applesauce, with a side of pumpkin pie and whipped cream. I tried the all-veggie version, with a veggie dog and sans gravy and stuffing; it was so huge, I couldn't even finish it lest there be no room left for pumpkin pie.   After eating, I worked it off playing their super-fun Funhouse pinball machine. Almost everything about this place ruled, from the cheap arcade games to the kitschy decor to the huge yam fries to the Looney Tunes cartoons projected onto a screen behind the bands.   I definitely don't need to eat a hot dog for another few months, but my next trip south will probably include a stop at Tubby Dog."}
{"text":"When in Calgary, one MUST visit Tubby Dog, if not simply for the novelty! The space has a diner feel, with retro nonperishable canned food items displayed on shelves around the seating area. There is also seating by the front, definitely worth claiming on a summer day, when they open the window completely and you're able to soak up some sun as you chow down.  Their hawt dawgs cost 7$ apiece, and will fill your stomach to the brim. Consuming the Sumo, with wasabi spread, Japanese mayo, and seaweed, topped with pickled ginger, was an oddly satisfying experience. There's also the PBJ. Smothered in peanut butter, jelly, and topped with (just when you didn't think things could get any weirder) Captain Crunch cereal... No joke!  They serve beer and side dishes as well. There is also a 'slaw dog, which I'll definitely have to try next time. For the vegetarians, there is an option to substitute the hot dog for a veggie dog.  Only downside is if you're driving, finding parking can be a pain at/on a busy time/day. There is a small parking lot beside Tubby Dog, but it's probably best to take the bus or walk. Besides, there are several more shops in the vicinity that are worth checking out on 17th Ave, perhaps to work up an appetite before a Tubby Dog lunch!"}
{"text":"Nomnomnom! LOVE this place! I definitely recommend the A-Bomb, there's nothing like it. It has chips, nacho cheese, bacon bits, and everything your little heart desires. Hubby and I have found our new favorite place :)"}
{"text":"There's a commercial I keep seeing lately for the Delissio Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza that says something along the lines of, \"If there's one thing guys like more than their two favorite things, it's a third thing MADE of those things.\" This seems to be the idea behind Tubby Dog... but then again, they don't stop at two.  I've only been to Tubby Dog once, and was subjected to a hotdog covered in peanut butter, jam, and Cap'n Crunch. It was like a conucopia of different dishes packed into one item that, short of including ketchup and Kraft Dinner, could not have more accurately encapsulated my childhood. Yet, with every bite, I could almost hear my arteries clogging and my doctor pronouncing a time of death. This sure aint your personal trainer's most recommended spot, but damn is it a lot of fun. Hell, they even had the peanut butter warmed up to just below melting, so it spread like any other topic - a minor touch you wouldn't THINK would matter, but somehow it made all the difference.  The prices are good, the food is definitely an experience I think everybody should have once, especially if you've been taking things too seriously lately and need to return to a time of naive innocence filled (at least for me) with memories of humanoid turtles ordering pizzas with marshmellows and chocolate chips. Every thing about this place, from the food, to the decor, to the attitude of the staff just screams pure, stupid, unpretentious fun.  That being said... I'm VERY glad I don't live too close to it.  PS - Any place that sells giant pickles instantly becomes epic in my books!"}
{"text":"This place is so great and I'm not sure why it hasn't been replicated where I live?! Not only can you have kraut, chili, pickles, and cheese on a delicious steamed hotdog, but you can have the most delicious onion rings cradled by a thick sweet casing of deep-fried heaven. And not only can you have this delectable reward food (we travelled and trekked quite a ways to get down to 17th from the C-Train) you can play actual ARCADE games. Like Street Fighter, PacMan, pinball, WOWZERS!!!!! If you like having a day where you throw calorie caution to the wind, please consider checking out Tubby Dog. Also, make the trek by foot. It makes it so much more rewarding and less taxing on your diet. Please note that I've read they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Great Hot Dogs! I ordered the A-Bomb and it was awesome! Lots of cheese and bacon! And the chips were crunchy and had a bit of a spicy feeling! Really enjoy the atmosphere too, a really cool hipster place. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Now this place i Love, they have arcade and good food, i got the nachos with the guac and pico de gallo, being from Texas and mexican, i was very suprised they got it on point, amazed lol how they know to make it taste authentic, the hot dog i got was good too, i will be coming here another time, the staff was so friendly and nice, if you want the best hot dogs in town, this is a must"}
{"text":"Good place to hit up if you are in a munchy mood for a funky hot dog. I don't visit often, but I do get a craving for the hot dogs every once in a while, and it's always a good place to hit up if you are hungry late at night. My personal fav is the a-bomb with the ketchup chips and the yam fries.   I love the arcade games they have here. Sometimes we walk by on 17th ave and if I have a few quarters, we stop in just to play some games. The employees are welcoming even when we just step in to play a few games. Love the atmosphere of this place, I think it's very entertaining and fun. Check it out if you are in a hot dog mood :)"}
{"text":"You say Tubby, I say dog.   You say Tubby,  I say Who you callin' Tubby?  I love Tubby Dog.  It has everything I need.   Veggie Sumo dog with goofy crap on the walls.   Not to Mention glass cases that enclose some of my childhood favorites.   If you need a taco dog, they got it.  If you need a chilli dog, they got it. If you need a sushi dog, they got it. If you, for some messed up reason desire a dog covered in PB & J and sprinkled with Captain Crunch ....well they got it.    Whatever floats your boat.   Oh yeah, if you just need a pickle and a beer with a late night punk rock show.  You guessed it.   They got it.  Here's to Tubby Dog.   The best Dog.   The top dog."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you like hot dogs!! My husband and I were feeling adventurous so we tried the Japanese style dog and the peanut butter & jam dog. The Japanese dog was fantastic. It was topped with ginger and had a wasabi flavour to it. I surprisingly really enjoyed the peanut butter and jam hot dog as well. The peanut butter got really melty and gooey. This place is quick and has a very retro vibe with the arcade games. We will be back to try more of their creations!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how awesome this place is.   The best I can do is say... Go there right now and get a hot dog. You won't regret it at all. You'll probably leave there with a second one under your arm."}
{"text":"Food is burned, fries are uneven. Staff is unprofessional and lazy. Ketchup doesn't work. Seats and tables are dirty."}
{"text":"This place is really relaxed and quite funky. The place is filled with old arcade machines, cereal boxes, and cool nicnacks.   The hot dogs and fries are amazing and the size of the fries is friggin huge. I will say to avoid the sumo dog unless you are used to eating a lot of ginger and seaweed, it upset my stomach but that was my fault. The toppings are piled on and that is fantastic if the topping happens to be something you are used to eating.  The staff are super friendly and very relaxed so don't expect anything super formal just be comfortable."}
{"text":"Oh tubby... What happened to you?   My last three trips have been utter disappointments and I am no longer prepared to travel to visit you.  Maybe if I'm in the area but never again will I drive the required 30 mins from home to you.     Of the last three trips you have been out of not dogs, served up a rather gross dog with stingy toppings, and were out of several toppings required on a good tubby dog today to the point we walked out and went else where.  I really was looking forward to it.   Boo.  The love affair between us is over but maybe with time we can be friends."}
{"text":"I'm not as crazy about hot dogs, but took my nephews there.  They have been talking about it for months.  The hot dogs were huge, the toppings generous and the staff very friendly.  The boys loved the A-Bomb and Captains Dog.  I tried the Captain's Dog, a huge hot dog with melted peanut butter, jam and Captain Crunch.  It was surprisingly good, the sweetness of the the PB&J, was offset with the saltiness of the hot dog.  The Captain Crunch added a crunch factor.  5 Stars because the boys loved it!  Tried the huge T-Rings.  They have late night / early morning window service."}
{"text":"I have been to Tubby Dog a couple times every time I have had an amazing hotdog. There creations are unreal And responsibly priced. Portions are huge. Inside is pretty cool they have alot of retro games. You can play. Last time I went I got my photos of to go since my dog was waiting in the car I asked if it was okay if I waited outside the guy working brought my.hotdog straight to my car door which was really nice of him."}
{"text":"Tubby dog is a fun, upbeat, colorful place with equally fun food. They even cater to non-meat eating friends! One of the best things is eating a non-meat hotdog with potatoe chips and all the fixings. The loads of junkfood together is an altogether fun food for meatatarians and vegetarians alike!  Make sure you grab a fork to eat your hotdog!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and interesting decor.  Had the regular 'tubby dog\" ($7) with cheese, mustard, chilli - wow - made  quite the mess...  but it was so worth it.  They have ol' school video games, like ms pac man, rampage, and a pinball machine.  Neat old toys, and pictures on the walls.  Seating area is small.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have been twice, and it is a quirky place with weird toppings, with a substandard hot dog sausage and an average bun.  The person at the counter left us with the impression we should know what we want immediately when we walked in, not saying that is the case, just our impression.  The staff seem tired, so does the environment, and the hot dogs are way OVERPRICED for what you get.  The best part is the giant tip jar at the til: for what? staring me down obnoxiously while we try to figure out what our order was? For taking my payment?   So overpriced hot dogs, tired environment, and customer service that needs some review by the owner/boss. All in all, try another spot.  K"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are ok but the staff are mostly pretentious jerks who make you feel like you don't deserve to be in their presence. Stop acting like douchebags and be friendly to your customers. That's the reason I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Last Friday, my boyfriend took me Downtown. We had Tubby HotDog for lunch. Tubby Hotdog is a small fast food restaurant. It is located at 17 Ave SouthWest Calgary. It sells hotdogs and some beers. We arrived the restaurant around 12 pm. The restaurant was very busy and had a line up at the front desk. But, the line moved fast. After waiting for 5 mins, we began to order our food. I had the Japanese Style SUMO, which includes Japanese mayo, seaweed salad, wasabi, pickled ginger, lightly toasted sesame seeds. My boyfriend had ordered TUBBY DOG, which made with Homemade chili, bacon, cheese, onions, mustard. Also, we had POUTINE and pop Drink to share. After that, we waited for our food for the while. The hot dogs were very well cooked. The taste of them was very different from each other. Sumo hot dog was Japanese hot dog. Classic Tubby hot dog was like chili cheese hot dog. They were all in the huge portion. The poutine was decent, but nothing excited. The prices of food were a little bit expensive. Both hot dogs were $8.50. The poutine was $7.50. The fountain drink was $3,00. In summary, Tubbydog was decent fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I heart Tubby Dog. A lot.  The reasons (from least to best) are the:  -Funky insides (think yellows and reds) -Fun employees  -Licensed -Cheap beer -Deep fried twinkies (just ask!) -Old school movies and TV shows -Awesome old video games -T-rings -Selection of weird hot dogs - ***A BOMB***  What is the A BOMB you ask? It kills your arteries with a juicy hot dog smothered in cheese sauce, covered in mayo, bacon bits, and cheese and ketchup. It is impossible to eat without being disgusting. It is the greatest hot dog ever made.  If you are lame you can make your own hot dog too.   If you're feeling lucky try the Cap'n Crunch. Just try it.   I take anybody who visits me here. Best of Calgary for sure."}
{"text":"Probably b/c I've sampled Dougie Doug back at home but it's a cool, casual atmosphere for the young folks lol.  Kinda retro, kinda funky, w/ framed pics of everything you'd expect at a diner but some comic stuff too.  Ordered the A-bomb: mayo, mustard, bacon, chips & lots of cheese.  For $7, depends if you're hungry or just to fulfill my curiosity.  Not something to run to but if you're walking by in the area..."}
{"text":"The best thing about Tubby Dog is that it's a 5 minute walk from my house.  The worst thing about Tubby Dog is that it's a 5 minute walk from my house.  Tubby Dog is a great collection of hot dogs, every topping imaginable, fries and sweet potato fries, the occasional all-ages punk rock show, pop culture TV shows on certain nights.  You can easily bring anyone here. From out of town tourists to kids under 10. Tubby Dog seems to serve anyone and everyone and will accommodate any palate (for example they once served a friend of mine a PLAIN hot dog).  Couple that with the fact that they're open until 4am on weekends (be prepared to brave the boozy line-ups) and you have a local institution.  One that is deliciously and dangerously close to where I live."}
{"text":"I'm not quick to give out 5 star reviews, but this place is very close, 4.5 easy.  Crazy good hot dogs with an amazing selection of truly unique toppings.  Killer fries and a good selection of beers.  Best of all, all their hotdogs are offered in Veggie form with Tofurkey Italian sausages.  5 of us ate here together and all 5 raved about the hot dogs...both meat & veggie versions.  HUGE quantities and good service."}
{"text":"Noticed a vacant store front next door to present Tubby dog with news papered windows and a Tubby Dog awning; this yelper decided to investigate.    Staff looked like a British indie rock band today or like they just got off a fishing boat in Nova Scotia but they were exceptionally friendly as always.  Seems like Tubby Dog is expanding its location to create a bigger one, perhaps in the next couple of months.    What the heck I am already inside why not order a Slaw Dog and a root beer.  Both rang up for under 8 bucks, counter guy asked if I wanted cheese which he so lavishly sprinkled on my coleslaw and chillied hot dog.  Delicious.    Today the place looked so clean, I wondered if they were closing early, counter guy chuckled \"no, we are open till 4am in the morning\".  I settled into my booth and watched a projected rerun of Seinfeld on the wall and some animated cartoon with French music in the background.  Again a very satisfying and entertaining meal dog gone it."}
{"text":"Hot dogs and kitsch aren't really my thing, but if they were I'd be here quite often (and would probably move closer in order to facilitate this!).  I had a veggie dog with chili (odd combination, yes, and one which seems to confuse people, but I just really like both veggie dogs and chili), and it totally satisfied.  Possibly overpriced by a loonie or so at $7, but reasonable enough.  I also loved the old classic arcade games in the back.  Again, not really my thing, but I'll admit to having wasted more than a few hours of the '90s playing the 'Funhouse' pinball game, and I was quite happy to see it and know where I can find it if the urge ever strikes again.  I'm holding off on giving 5* only because I think the menu could offer more in the way of higher quality topping options (for example, things like sauteed mushrooms or peppers might be nice).  Otherwise, I applaud this unique and welcome addition to 17th Ave (and to Calgary in general)"}
{"text":"The A-Bomb will make you a believer in their gospel of food. The best tasting things are always the worst for you right? And this is a total heart attack waiting to happen. I'll take two, thanks."}
{"text":"I LOVE TUBBY DOG!  Sometimes you're just in the mood for a heart attack on a plate. And pretty much, that's what you get here...it's artery clogging goodness. Whether its lunch, dinner, or a late night snack, Tubby Dog always hits the spot. I usually go for the A-Bomb because it's pretty much the perfect size, except I have to eat it with a knife and fork. Some of my more adventurous friends have gone for the Ultimate Gripper, and I commend them...it's huge and I don't know how they do it! I love that they have pickles for $1, genius. I DON'T love how it's cash only, because I always forget. I really like the atmosphere here, it's a mixed bag of people depending on when you go, and definitely leaning towards the hipster crowd. Late night it gets super packed, and sometimes they have a band playing as well (HOW they can fit a band into the tiny place is beyond me...!). I've also been here a few times for Taco Tuesday, which is really fun and the tacos aren't bad either. My other favourite things about Tubby Dog are playing Ms Pac Man after I eat, checking out all the cool stuff on the walls, and drooling over their weekly/monthly creations on their Facebook page. I think everyone should try Tubby Dog, just to say they did!"}
{"text":"Not many people in Calgary seem to know about this hole in the wall, but it is a great and unique place that i love. Located on the busy 17th avenue, Tubby Dog is known for its pickled eggs and great tasting Olympia beer. I usually get about 5 or 6 pickled eggs each time i go, and i like to ask for a small cup of nacho cheese to dip them in on the side. On Saturdays they usually host some great live music, and you can catch a great local ska band while you enjoy your eggs. Tubby Dog also has a great selection of arcade games and pinball machines, including some of my childhood favorites like burgertime, street fighter, and the fantastic Toy Story Pinball, featuring all of Calgary's favourite toys. On Wednesdays they have a special rotisserie chicken day and you can get a whole bird stuffed with your favorite pizza toppings for quite a reasonable price. The interior is charmingly decorated with many classic items from the great depression, giving it a nice retro feel. Overall this place is a great hidden gem of Calgary, and I recommend this place to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Interesting hot dog place for geeks. They allow you to customize your hotdog with quite a lot of ingredients, or choose from preset ones. Lots of old school arcade games for you to play (not for free :P). The hot dog tasted alright, but you could potentially make your own and I'd imagine it to be similar. May come back to show friends the novelty, but likely would not make a return trip on my own."}
{"text":"Quintessential Calgary venue. Delicious dawgs. Amazing tacos. Perfect sass. Try the Sumo! You won't regret it..."}
{"text":"Tubby Dog, oh Tubby Dog, where for art thou my Tubby Dog?   Turns out they're in a handy little spot on 17th Ave. And a great stop for late night munchies.  The first time I ever had a Tubby Dog was over the summer. It was after hours, and by after hours I think closer to 3 am, so only the walk up window was open. But being that it was a nice summer night, I ordered my A-bomb and sat down on a nearby bench to gobble it up with my friends (note: they were chowing down on their own dogs).  The next time I stopped in at Tubby Dog was during a bachelorette party, it was also a late night munchie stop, but we managed to talk ourselves past the door just as they were switching over to the walk up window only.  This time round I had me a classic. It was just as big and messy as the A-bomb.   I have yet to hit up Tubby Dog for any of their live events, though I've heard good things about them (bands and movie nights), so that's next up on my list besides sniffing out the other items on their menu.  A little insider tip: Don't be afraid to grab a fork."}
{"text":"Based on the hype, my family decided to try this place. It was definitely a throwback to the era of pinball and arcade games. So atmosphere was pretty good but the music was not my cup of tea. It was hard to talk or concentrate with the head banging alternative music. Maybe tone it down to just hard rock and light metal?    We wandered in on a Saturday and it was not very busy at 5:45pm. We ordered the Tubby Dog as a classic menu item. It looked appealing. Sadly, my mouth was thoroughly unimpressed. I had a veggie dog which was flavourful with a good spicy heat and the texture was fine too but I was really turned off by the lukewarm watery chili and bacon bits on top. I was expecting my food to be hot and I always get concerned when it's not from a food safety perspective. Hubby and son had a regular hot dog and it was piping hot under the lukewarm chili. The bun was also too soft to hold the toppings and was a terrible mess. I expected more in terms of quality for the price point. The boys said flavour was mediocre. We also shared a plate of fries. I actually have no comment. They were just fried potatoes.   Overall, we were underwhelmed and won't return here. I'm sure if you love hot dogs and need a quick after bar munchie fix, this hits the spot but I can think of many other places in town I'd rather visit."}
{"text":"Tubby Dog is located on the main strip of 17th Avenue in the SW.  It can get pretty nuts driving around there.  You can park on the road (at certain hours?) or there is a parking lot right near by.  I believe its park and pay but we didn't pay ehehehehehe. (note: i'm not encouraging this!!)  I've always driven by this place, and heard about the crazy hotdogs like captain crunch, pb&j.......  but I always just wanted to stop by and try their hotdogs, even it if was nothing crazy.  When I first entered, I noticed the big menu behind the cashier and prep area.  Classic tubby dog, Cheetah, Yogi Bear, Hario, A-Bomb, Sumo, Slaw dog, PBJ, Choose your own adventure and then Sherm's ultimate gripper.  I tried to go with the more 'normal' hot dog but I didn't want anything toooo plain so I went with the A-Bomb (cheese, bacon, mayo, mustard, ketchup and potato chips).  The other two went with the Classic tubby dog (homemade chili, bacon, cheese, onions and mustard) and the Slaw dog (coleslaw, homemade chili, mustard, cheddar and pickle).  I also got a pickled egg just because.  We gave our names and had a seat.  The dining area is pretty retro; it's very busy on the wall with posters and toys.  There's loud music playing and the seating is very limited, so you'll be lucky to get a seat on the weekend as it seems people usually just sit and mingle with friends even after they're done eating.  Anyways, our hot dogs were ready and they looked awesome.  Note: Fork and knife preferred method of eating if you don't want too much of a mess.  I found the wiener to be nice and juicy as the hot dogs are made to order...it fit the bun perfectly..lengthwise but I found there was a lot of bread.  I wasn't a big fan of the ketchup chips on the A-bomb and I wish there was more bacon but other than that I enjoyed it.  From the classic tubby dog, Anna wasn't the biggest fan of the chili but enjoyed it otherwise.  And for the Slaw dog, it was a hit.  Tubby dogs seems like a place that should be on diners, drive-ins and dive.  I can just picture Guy Fieri in the back with the hot dog makers, loading a hot dog up with lots of random stuff and shoving it in his mouth and saying \"THE SAUCE IS MONEY!\" then taking another bite. -_-.  I'm glad I stopped by to try this place but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here unless I was realllllly craving it.  I recommend this place if you want a different hot dog, but for me I like Peter's Drive In hot dogs or Costco's polish hot dogs..yum!"}
{"text":"As an Edmontonian I was not sure there was anything that could top my beloved Fat Franks on Whyte Ave but then I found Tubby Dog. The decor is fun and reminiscent of a fifties style diner with pictures of the old live action Batman show and retro cartoons being projected on the walls.  The food was absolutely delicious! For a seven dollar price tag you more than get your monies worth as the hotdogs are piled high with fresh and delicious ingredients. The chili on my tubby dog was especially delicious and the onions were very flavorful. They have mexican glass bottles of coke which was especially neat to see as I have never seen a coke bottle that long and tall.  It's always nice to experience uniquely local businesses when away on vacation and i'm sure my heart will long for Tubby Dog long after I return home to Edmonton."}
{"text":"Tubby dog! A novel place to get a dog or get a wild gourmet explosion !! They got all kinds of toppings here from the normal ketchup and mustard to captain crunch or wasabi! CRAZY!  I have been coming here probably three times a year for the last five years, needless to say it hasn't been the greatest 5 years for me personally but man I tell you everytime I get one of their dogs it makes me smile inside and out! Just really fun and really great tasting dogs!   Some of the dogs here are not for the faint of stomach! Their famous a bomb will blow your insides into a knot and make you scream for mercy! The japenese dog is an asian invasion on your tongue, that wasabi will sting you like a bee!   The peanut butter and jelly dog is surprisingly good and not as weird as you might expect. The cheetah is my fave here! Cheese sauce and sauerkraut and other stuff I can't remember! Was it bacon?? most likely so..... I also recommend you eat a pickled egg here! It's really good!   Tubby dog actually is more than just another kooky joint, it has live music ! A very cool venue actually! watching a band here sort of feels and sounds like watching a band in their own practice space!  So come on down to one of Calgarys hot dog institutions, FYI dont bring your best shirt you are gonna get filthy! You can't not enjoy it here!   22/30"}
{"text":"try the popular hotdog in calgary,i can say its ok nothing really different in reg hotdog,fries is not crunch its saggy"}
{"text":"An old friend and I were hanging out on 17th today and can rarely pass by Tubby Dog without going in. Apparently, we had just missed a rush of people at lunch time, and for once got to hang out in a quiet Tubby Dog whereby we listened to Mumford and Sons and enjoyed some yam fries. This was a really great light to see Tubby Dog in; it gets irritating to visit and be swarmed with obnoxious drunk people yelling, really.  Tubby Dog is really great. In an area where so many places are making attempts to find weird hip niche markets like crazy poutines and sugary confections and stuff, I really admire Tubby Dog for being its own kind. There is always cool stuff happening there, whether it be shows, 90210 Tuesdays, or whatever, and I guarantee it is the only shop in Calgary with vegan haggis and vintage cereal and pickles displayed proudly in its cases. All of my couchsurfers I've ever hosted who have walked by Tubby Dog have demanded to try it, photodocumented it, and left pretty stoked as well. You are one of a kind, Tubs, and you don't even have to try. Thanks for being so damn rad.   *Review 11/30 of Yelp's 30 day challenge 2012"}
{"text":"This is one of those things you try but only once. They pour on a ridiculous amount of toppings to the point you're wondering if there's a hotdog in there. No big deal right? If you happen to be in there after a date with cravings for something random this might be the place to skip. You'll smell like it all night long and be struggling not to get anything on yourself. The struggle was real. Inside the venue I found an industrial mosh pit going on with a friendly bunch of hipster computer geeks. Kind of fun for a few minutes but you have to yell to get your order out lol."}
{"text":"I only heard about Tubby Dog six months ago and somehow never noticed it, even though I've lived in Calgary since it opened.  I read Leonard C's review today and couldn't believe his comment about bagel size onion rings, so I finally had to check it out.  Sure enough.  They might be small bagels, but the onion rings really are that big and dark.  I was kind of scared to eat one but they actually are really good, so of course I had more.  I also had the Tubby Dog and my spouse ate the A-Bomb.  Thumbs up.  His bottled pop was kinda pricey but there's no doubt that everything you pay for is probably five times the calories you need to consume, so truly you're getting your money's worth.  I'm sure there are few people that leave without tight pants.    The retro decor is cool and yet it has the grubby, arena type atmosphere which leaves you feeling like you may want to change your clothes or shower after the entire experience.  I'm not complaining though because I'll go again to try other stuff and I think it's a novel place to take visitors."}
{"text":"I loved their gourmet hot dog selections and creative spin on an old classic. Their onion rings were a little spicy for my taste and I thought they had a little too much batter on them. My A Bomb hot dog, on the other hand, was amazing and I loved the creativity that was put into making my dish. Definitely great portion sizes and super cool that they are licensed to sell alcohol. It's a nice spot to end your night!"}
{"text":"One of the true eccentrics of our city. The ambiance is great, kinda like a run-down dorm, and the food is highly entertaining. I usually stick to the tried-and-true sauerkraut dog, though I suspect I will one day try the Cap'ns Dog. And when you can, get it with the Polish sausage - so juicy! Detachable jaws are highly recommended here."}
{"text":"My guy Adrian (same guy that recommend Naina's Stuffed Burgers so clearly he knows what's up) recommend this spot. Gourmet craft hot dogs,arcade games ,beer, liquor, what more could you ask for? My experience at Tubby Dog was five star all the way around. Hot dog stand feel that being a Chicago native really made me feel at home and a bit nostalgic. They have a host of different options for dogs and you can go with either a traditional hot dog ,a bacon wrap dog, a veggie dog ,a turkey dog, or Ukrainian sausage which is made in the house. They have a featured dog which this week was \"The Bourdain\"(cheese, pizza sauce , pepperoni, dog)  to our dear departed Anthony Bourdain's memory. One in particular that caught my attention was the PB&J dog which ,as you guessed it, is peanut butter and jelly with a hotdog in the middle of it. Although I didn't try it I'm told it's quite surprisingly delicious....and it wouldn't be a Canadian spot if they didn't offer some poutine. I decided to go with the namesake of the restaurant \"The Tubby Dog\" traditional hot dog covered in homemade chili ,bacon, cheese, and onions. Now I know what you Detroit people are thinking, that's a Coney Dog, and you're absolutely right add the bacon. I needed a fork and knife to eat this one and I have to say it really delivered on all of the taste buds I have for a delicious hot dog. I decided to wash it down with a fountain Coke that was mixed perfectly and clearly a well taken care of fountain machine. Although it's quite rare that I have Coca-Cola anymore as someone that always loved it you've got to make sure if you have an establishment that serves it the fountain machines are serviced regularly and the mixture between the soda and the CO2 is right on. Small attention to detail like this along with an immaculate clean bathroom tell you the management of this restaurant is on point... good job Tubby Dog staff! Host of arcade games including classics like Asteroids, an original version of Space Invaders , Ms Pac-Man( My Aunt Caren loved this game )  various pinball machines and of course my personal favorite Double Dragon. Unlike Pin Bar it's not a dollar a game it's $0.25 on the average andnd while this place was busy it wasn't over crowded. The parking is fairly easy with pay meters on the street.  The staff was very friendly, informative, prompt, and great service. If you're in the area you have a hankering for a good hotdog or something that resembles one if you don't eat meat come into Tubby Dog. In the words of my former Governor ....I'll be back."}
{"text":"A heart attack waiting to happen.   But that's what people want.   Tubby Dog provides a venue to experiment with sausages to your heart's content. It is a refreshing take on a classic.   Be sure to hit the gym next day."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go, but go hungry!  Even the kids' hotdog would probably feed a fat guy.  I find that one hotdog is good for two people.  I love this place and wish it great success!  My only recommendation would be if they could put a few \"basics\" on their menu for the hot dog purists like me."}
{"text":"Soooo hug-ry, oops did I step on yoo- whoa man, what is that? Is that it? It is, we made it, I knew it was reeeal! TUBBY DOG!!  Hi Tubby, I's freeem Edmononin, I have waited my whole life, to come get drunk on Electric Ave (what what, its not called that anymore? ... dam!) and eat a legendary Tubby Dog.   You are soft, sweet, spicy and smell like Heaven made in a bun from Heavens Heaven. You are the Funky Pickle of Southern Alberta and you rock! Seriously though people, maybe it is the all hype, maybe its that I can't get it but twice a year on my pilgrimage down south, maybe it that I've never been anywhere close to sober (nah, I don't think its that) but there is just something about the TD that makes me drool with anticipation...  Not one to look a gift dog in the mouth I always go for the crazy, the strange and the unusual and usually, it pays off. At Tubby Dog this always rings of truth, my go to dog and perennial favourite is the PBJ that is topped with Cap'n Crunch cereal. Dear lord that is good!   Senior Tubster, I salute you!"}
{"text":"Tuby Dog has a hipster/retro 80s atmosphere and good service. Nice place to hangout with friends but the food is mediocre. It's like an overpriced Costco hotdog with strange toppings that you could replicate at home. My friends and I got sick of the chili hotdog after our first try. Tater tots poutine was not hot and the cheese didn't melt. It got soggy and gross. The amount of grease in our food was overwhelming. As high school students, this place is pretty expensive compared to other places around Western Canada High School."}
{"text":"Tubby Dog has become a unique institution in this town for those of us who are either a) looking for a daring hot dog, or b) looking for a bohemian type atmosphere without downing a bottle of absinthe.  When I first walked into the small shop, there was a guy with fried bacon and an egg on his dog, best of the Clash in the air, and a classic episode of the Prisoner on the projection screen.  I was hooked.  Ok, it ain't all that healthy, and this is something you really should do in moderation, but when you do go.... it's absolutely awesome.  Oh, and don't forget to get a side of yam fries to tie it all off!"}
{"text":"Delightful Saturday afternoon treat, cartoons on a projector included! First time here and ordered the A Bomb, regular wiener. The A bomb is ketchup mustard mayo bacon chip crumbs and cheese sauce! It was messy but delicious. My friend ordered a side of onion rings too, which looked like donuts but apparently are fantastic.  Fun food and atmosphere, good service. Will be returning again to try something a bit more crazy- why wouldn't you try cereal on your hot dog?"}
{"text":"It had been at least 7 years since my last visit to Tubby Dog until last night.  I ordered the Sumo which had seaweed salad, Japanese mayo, picked ginger and wasabi (lots of it). I also ordered a side of yam chips. Everything was for take out and I specified that.  I had asked for no sesame seeds in my seaweed as my wife is allergic and she was going to share. They acknowledged all of these requests.  While we waited we played a game of Pac Man for a quarter.  Our food came out and wasn't packaged to-go like we asked. After we told them we asked for take out they put everything in to go containers.  We got home and discovered there were sesame seeds even after we had specified not to have any.  There was way too much ginger and wasabi. The flavors didn't balance well as there wasn't enough mayo.  Our yam fries were soggy, dripping with oil and they weren't cooked all the way through.  The only good experience I had was playing Pac Man while waiting for the food.  I'll have to think twice about trying Tubby Dog again. If I do, I'll have to make sure I bring cash as they don't take any form of credit or debit."}
{"text":"The hot dogs here are unique and delicious. I had the sumo dog with wasabi, ginger, seaweed and seasame seeds. The flavors worked amazing together. Slightly too much toppings for my liking but overall great."}
{"text":"I LOVE cool, hip places like Tubby Dog. It's so creative and fun and you can't go wrong with food when it comes to those words. If you've never been here before do expect to get messy because their hot dogs are overloaded with toppings! Personally I don't like hot dogs, it's not the first thing on my list to eat, but I would come back here just so I can \"create my own adventure\" and get funky with it."}
{"text":"The quality of the hot dog is okay, but seriously the toppings are way too much. I like to eat my hot dog with my hands, not a fork and knife while using a thousand tiny napkins to wipe my face."}
{"text":"Oh Tubby Dog how I've missed thee.   It came up a couple months ago that my girlfriend, a born-and-raised Calgarian, had never been to Tubby Dog (I know right?!). So I came all the way back from Toronto just to take her here.  She went with the restaurant's namesake and I went with my old standby, the A-bomb. The dogs were as massive as I remember. You can't possibly fit them into your mouth without making a mess. Oddly I've never been here while intoxicated and I wonder how I would fair. That will have to wait.  The hot dogs were fantastic as always. My only minor complaint about mine was that in the crushed chips mix they use salt and vinegar in the mix. I found this flavour to throw things off a little. Not a big thing but enough for me to note it.  Everyone talks about hitting these guys up after the bar, but my fav. past time was to venture in before a hockey or Roughnecks game to fill up before drinking some heroin beers at the 'Dome."}
{"text":"If you like hot dogs with all the adds on and more, this is the place for you!  There is a very eclectic selection of hot dogs including a deep-fried bacon wrapped dog, a dog with PB & J (yes that peanut butter and jelly!), and captain crunch! Who thinks of these things - only the genius Tubby Dog owners!  Apart from that their onion rings are incredible - they are like donuts! Lots of batter and huge chunk of onions. They are incredible.  If I had more time here, I would definitely go back and try all of the dogs on that menu! It is definitely a place that any adventurous foodie should seek out!"}
{"text":"The name is weird, but so is the food.  They serve hot dogs, but with every imaginable topping known to man.  This really is quite an interesting idea for a fast food joint.  I have yet to see another food joint that compares to Tubby Dog.  They certainly went out on a limb with these strange but delicious dogs, served with practically whatever you want.  These toppings include everything from chilli to pizza sauce, bacon to potato chips.  They even have a peanut butter and jelly hot dog.  I've never been brave enough to try this one, but other people must like it or it wouldn't be on the menu.  It seems just a little too strange for me.  At first glance, it would seem that the prices at Tubby Dog are a little extreme, but once you finish your dog, you'll understand why.  Each one is very filling and equally as satisfying.  They are big hot dogs with plenty of toppings, so you really are getting what you pay for.  Whether you're heading home from the bar, or just taking a stroll down 17th, Tubby Dog is a good way to fuel your hunger.  I recommend trying at least one hot dog from this place.  Once you do, you'll want to try them again and again!"}
{"text":"Love!! I limit going here to once or twice a year because it's a giant hot dog loaded up with all sorts of heart-clogging ingredients but I'd eat here more often if I didn't care about getting tubby from Tubby Dog. The late night order window is awesome after the 17th ave bars let out after last call and you meet some interesting drunk people who are also craving chips, wasabi or peanut butter on their hot dog."}
{"text":"Tubby Dog is a gem of our fair city.  Hot dogs, sporadic punk shows, kitsch ...  What more could you ask for?  I always find it nearly impossible to resist the A-bomb (cheese, bacon, potato chips ... y'know ... the essentials!), but the other hot dogs are all really good as well.  I was surprised how good the Cap'ns Dog was when I first tried it. I thought it would be more of a novelty, but the crunch of the cereal and the salty/sweetness of the PB&J actually makes for a really unique, well-balanced hot dog.  What more can I say?  Great hot dogs, slightly on the pricey side for a hot dog (roughly $7 apiece), but always a fun experience and sometimes it is JUST what I am craving."}
{"text":"I know, I can't believe it either - 5 stars for a whole in the wall serving hot dogs...  BUT THEY'RE SOOOO GOOD ON SO MANY LEVELS.  Tubby Dog is a little hipster joint on 17th Ave in Calgary, which sells - as the name suggests - tubby dogs (tubby 'cause they're kinda fat). I'm not sure how to describe the atmosphere seeing as it's kind of retro, sometimes people watch movies on the back wall and tonight a bunch of people were playing Street Fighter on tv's. So it is what it is. Cute, laid back and fun.  On to the dogs. They're creative in so many ways. They take a 1/3 lb hot dog (some are wrapped in bacon), put them in a freshly baked bun (so soft and fresh) and then top them with the most random (but delicious) concoctions. Tonight I had the \"Yan Yeti IV\" (I don't know what that means), but it was a hot dog topped with poutine. Please sign me up for angioplasty any day now as I can feel the need for it coming on. My friend had a hot dog topped with mustard, ketchup, bacon, cheese (so far boring) - but then POTATO CHIPS. Weird - yet both were delicious. Not to overshadow the star of the joint, but the homemade french fries are beyond amazing. They are very brown and home cut.   For being what it is and doing what it does, it does this well - so for that I say 5 stars. I loooves me some Tubby Dog."}
{"text":"I would recommend you go here once at least and decide for yourself if its cool or not.  So in that way Tubby Dog isn't on the avoid list.  BUT, I always leave wondering what exactly they are trying to be? A semi-bar? A \"unique\" food destination? A trendo-scenester hang out? OR all of the above?! Hahhah.  SO you can get a HUGE but overpriced hot dog with captain crunch cereal as a topping. I suppose this makes you trendily \"weird\" in a cool, funny way to order such a thing. Also, you can order a regular sized can of beer for about $6. Occasionally, you can see a local band play here, stuffed into the back corner of the place with no stage or real floor area.  Mainly \"alternative\" scenesters hang out here, but late at night klub douches may swing in for a hot dog to soak up all the Jagger-bombs.  I'm sorry, the hot dogs here just are not as great as their reputation, and are certainly overpriced.  Like I said DO come here and decide for yourself, but if you MAY be disappointed :)"}
