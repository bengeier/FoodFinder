{"text":"I use to love this place and traveled from downtown biweekly to have my fix. The quality has definitely gone downhill. Not sure if the bbq master was replaced but the meats are not that much better than what Chinese grocery stores produce. Better luck going to the other Chinese bbq stand a few stores down, quality is similar to what HKS use to be."}
{"text":"My favorite are roasted pig & roasted duck, I tried chicken in soy sauce once and is very delicious! This is food court meal but I think it is way better than restaurent. Very good price. Their food is always fresh, especially the roasted pig, the skin is so crispy and not salty at all. I had been visit this place numerious time :) 

Looking for cheap and yummy BBQ? Must try this place!"}
{"text":"There's always a line here, but the bbq is definitely not the best. We ordered a free run chicken, half a bbq duck, half pound red sausage, and a cha siu (bbq pork) for takeout. Because they were so busy, the person chopping up all the meat chopped everything very poorly. A lot of the meat was in tiny pieces.

The chicken was very chewy for some reason. It must've been a very \"old\" chicken. 

The bbq duck was average, just like any other Chinese bbq place. 

The red sausage was very soft, it kinda just melted in my mouth. 

The cha siu was also average.

Overall 2/5 stars. This place would probably be my last resort for bbq."}
{"text":"Best be place in first markham place and surrounding area. Best prices and they don't skimp out on quantity of meat they give you. BBQ pork, roast pork and chicken is all tender and juicy. No complaints."}
{"text":"The only problem is how inconsistent they are. The food ranges from OK to excellent. The inconsistencies are: food temperature, and quality of meat. That being said, their speed of service is always amazing."}
{"text":"$8.2 (after tax) for #15 four items on rice. Which is just 2 choices of meat with veggies, tofu and roasted salty egg on the side. Comes with a drink. 

This is surprisingly bigger and more packed with food than I expected. The advertised pictures on the menu showed quite simple dishes that appears to have smaller portions than it really does. As you can see, the actual dish is actually loaded with meats.

It was a lot more oily than I expected, the pieces of meat was quite fatty as well. There wasn't a lot of meat on the roasted duck either. The tofu was soaked too, and even though the picture advertised with broccoli they only had lettuce.

Order was quickly placed and they served me food all within 5 minutes. There was sauces you can pick from in front of the store too. Recommend the green onions with garlic sauce for the chicken, tastes great just mixed with the rice too - it's quite salty though.

Overall, the plate was quite filling, should be enough food to feed 2 average Asians. Decent food for a decent place, pretty average in terms of hk BBQ rice places."}
{"text":"Mmmm I really miss these roasted meats in Mississauga, so we definitely got our fair fill during our visit to Markham today! My sister got the marinated squid, my mother the roasted pork, and my father the roasted duck.

All three portions were super generous!! The duck and pork were of great value - at only roughly $6 per plate, it came with a huge portion of meat, lots of rice, a side of napa cabbage, a choice of soup or chrysanthemum tea, and endless ginger scallion oil! Soooo yummy - especially the ginger scallion! 

The squid was the most expensive at roughly $8; however, I found it the least flavourful. It was missing some of the marinated sauce and oomph associated with the typical marinated squid you eat in Hong Kong. That said, the meal was still great! Would come again."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for many years and I can honestly say that in my opinion it is the best Chinese BBQ in the best food court in the city. I usually go with BBQ pork and Roast pork on rice."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is a deal!

Located in the food court of first markham place, I believe there are two Hk BBQ places, this is obviously the one that is always busy and sometimes with a short line up. They are fast even if there is a line up.

I rate this 5 stars because you gotta give credit where it's due. They are fast, the food is good, the portion is great, and the price is awesome. Most lunch boxes are between $4.75-6.75

Depending on how hungry you are, one meat with veggies will be about $5.50 and two meat with veggies will be about $6.20. Lunch comes with choice of soup, soy milk, or chrysanthemum tea. 

They also have a $5.50 special that includes TWO meat items (roasted BBQ pork, free range chicken and veggies) 

Deal! I often like to drop by for my Hk BBQ fix and pick up a lunch box before I go to work."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to FMP this is my #1 choice for food.  I believe it's because of the glass windows where they display all their meats and you just can't help yourself from drooling when your eyes catch a glimpse of the glistening meat.  I usually get BBQ pork and Red Sausage on rice with extra sauce.  The BBQ Pork is moist and tender and I just love Red Sausages.  It's about $7 and comes with your choice of soy milk or chrysanthemum tea.  Best bang for your buck in terms of quality and quantity in this food court in my opinion.  I also recommend their soy sauce chicken legs, Roast Pork and BBQ Duck.  There's a reason why the line up here is always longer than the other BBQ place 2 units over."}
{"text":"This place is in the food court of First Markham Place.  I went here recently with my parents and my dad had the Roasted pork and Peking duck on rice combo ($5.95) here and he loved it.

They are very generous with the meat.  He got a pile of pork and duck on white rice and there was a side of steamed broccoli as well.  The combo also came with a free cold sweetened iced tea (which he gave to me and it was delicious).  I tried a piece of the pork and duck and they were well marinated and had lots of flavour.  The meats were lean and not overly fatty.

He enjoyed his meal so much that afterwards he ordered some more roasted pork and some BBQ pork to take home.  The BBQ pork was one of the best I've ever had.  Extremely lean with a sweet BBQ flavour. 

We had our meal around 4pm and the place was not crowded, by the time we ordered the takeout it was 5pm and there was a long lineup. 

They have the meats hanging up behind the glass to the right of the counter, so not for the squeamish!  

I totally recommend this place for Asian BBQ meats!"}
{"text":"This stall in the food court of first Markham place gets busy quickly during the lunch hour on weekdays (can't say for sure on weekends). They're busy for a good reason too! For $5.75, you can choose any one type of bbq meat on rice and it comes with a side of veggies and a soup or drink (drinks include soy milk and crysanthamum tea).

The portions are pretty generous and I can easily have a box split into two and a half meals. I had the roast duck on rice and I'm sure the meat portions of it must've been half a duck!Rice is cooked perfectly and absorbs the sauce very well. You can ask the lady taking the order for extra sauce, either on the side or in your container.

Even though there were a lot of people, the staff working in the stall were fast to take our order and provided us with a number they called when it was ready. The service was fast and efficient - exactly what I'm looking for at a food court stall!

Overall, I'm definitely coming back for more the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came here twice and decided I will not visit this place again. First time was ok just the green onion ginger sauce for chicken is way too salty. Nothing special compared with the other BBQ place. Second time was horrible because I can literally tell they were using some unfresh meat to make BBQ pork. The smell was like you defrost the meat couple days ago but you forgot and left the meat in the fridge. And you didn't realize until one day a strong smell came when you open your fridge. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. The roast pork is quite good but the roast duck is not that good. The duck doesn't have a deep enough colour to it and the skin doesn't glisten. The woman who is normally there, is really really miserable. Nobody else has commented on this, so it might just be towards me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They only take cash so come prepared.

I visited this place when I was just a kid, as a teenager, and now as a young adult and this place remains consistent, through and through.  Every time I've craved BBQ pork and roast pork, I always go to this place. 

The prices remain more or less the same throughout the years, and the cashier(s) has always been nice.  Every meal comes with a complimentary drink--my personal favorite is the chrysanthemum tea. One meal I'd suggest trying is the BBQ Pork/Roast Pork rice with extra sauce."}
{"text":"Has to be the best bbq pork North of Toronto. I go here often. I usually get the pork and and chicken. It usually takes me 2 sittings to finish it! Which is why I recommend getting it go no matter what. 

It's less than $8 for a meal here, it's crazy value for how good the bbq pork is. 

Always a line up during lunch hour, I go a little early to avoid it."}
{"text":"For food court food - very good and very reasonable value.  

Most BBQ meat and rice plates range anywhere from $5.50 to $7.00  This is very reasonable considering that the price of BBQ has gone up dramatically over the past few years.  

While we didn't buy any of the rice combos, we ordered about 1.5 pounds of the roast pork which was 6.50/lb.  This is not bad considering a lot of places sell it for $7 to $7.99/lb.  

The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was not too fatty and it wasn't overly salty.

Verdict: One of the better BBQ takeout joints in the GTA."}
{"text":"Great price for what you get! There's always a line up at lunch to order, but they quick to prepare. You have the option of chrysanthemum tea or soy milk! 

You can pick two meats for your noodle bowl. Definitely go with the duck as one. 

The bbq meats, as well as the cabbage, will fill you, so I recommend that you ask for 1/2 portion of noodles! 

Don't forget to fill up your bowl with ginger greens and hot sauce."}
{"text":"The OG bbq house in FMP. Don't be fooled by the newer Extra BBQ house a couple units down!

HKS is cheap and has really great cuts of meat! I love that they have soup, chrysanthemum tea or soymilk to choose from."}
{"text":"Superb value and excellent quality meats. Service is lacking though nut what do you expect from a food court. If you want to share your meal you might consider bringing your own utensils and plate because they might deny you!"}
{"text":"In a food court full of Asian restaurants, including a very similar competitor nearby, HKS stands out as one of the best, not just in this food court, but among Chinese BBQ restaurants.

The food is consistently good and really cheap! Other diners must agree because the lineup at the counter is usually the longest. My favourite dish is the BBQ duck and crispy roast pork with rice combo."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 dishes and it is very tasty. After eating, both of us have severe dry mouth. One of us have cracked lips, bumps like ulcers starting to grow on inner lower lip. We both feel hyper in our brains and have restless sleep though the night, woken up by hot flashes and severe dry mouth. We have never smoked nor drunk any alcohol. The food must be over using MSG causing us to get such a bad experience. Upon checking the Internet,  we have confirmed that these symptoms are common after consuming MSG. We also found that MSG turns on cancer cells. As such, we will refrain from eating at this shop."}
{"text":"SO GOOD AND SO CHEAP !!!

I usually go for their duck on noodle !! You choose rice or rice noodle, then pick your meat (duck, chicken, or pork). You can choose 1 meat or 2 that comes with a side of lettuce/veggie. You also get a choice of soy bean, or tea.

Sometimes the line can be pretty long."}
{"text":"I travel from downtown Toronto just to eat here. Delicious, quick and costs less than $8."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Chinese BBQ. Its filling, it taste good and its cheap.

Got the roast duck and BBQ pork with rice for $7 taxes in. Thats pretty much the same price as a Big Mac Combo. The portion size is large. They give you a pile of rice and a bunch of meat. The BBQ pork was really lean with little fat just the way I like it. The duck meat though was a little disappointing. There was mostly bones but still tasted good of course. But for $7 I can't complain. 

This place is always busy during lunch hours and for food court type food its really good.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This food stall inside First Markham Place probably has one of the best BBQ food in the GTA. The only ones I can think of that can compare to that are King's Noodle in Chinatown (and even that the quality has gone down) and a BBQ food stall in Alton Towers Circle in which I forgot the name.

Their BBQ pork and soy chicken are the two musts for this place. Whether you want rice to add to that is up to your discretion, although I'm not much of a rice person so I usually just have it stock take-out.

Service is, well, typical Chinese quality. Again, it's just a food stall, don't expect valet treatment...or any treatment for that matter."}
{"text":"This is usually my go to when I craving Hong Kong style bbq, especially roast pork.
Their quality is typically consistent if you eat in - your choice of bbq meat(s) over a bed of rice/noodles with stewed cabbage and sauce.
I remember the cabbage used to be such a star since they cook it with all the meat juices and it gives it so much flavour. The sauce that they pour over the rice makes me lick the plate clean...which is kinda hard given the portions.
The meats got a lot better ever since the other bbq place opened and they got some serious competition. 
For the past couple of times, roast pork had some pork belly pieces that just melt in your mouth. They also don't give you the dry cha siu unless you ask for lean cuts.
Another thing I need to nitpick is how the noodles are all broken, so it's quite hard to eat."}
{"text":"HKS has long been the go to Chinese BBQ stall in First Markham Place.    There's usually always a line up at this stall especially during the dinner and lunch rush.  

The food is pretty good but its hit and miss for me as some days the BBQ is great while other days its okay.  Value wise the price point is great as boxed lunches are around $5-$9 and the portions are pretty big so can't really go wrong here.

Overall a good place in the mall to grab some Chinese BBQ."}
{"text":"Located inside First Markham Place's food court, this place is my favourite for Roast Pig Chinese BBQ style!!

Been coming here for years, their other BBQ items are not the greatest, but still yummy.  Their main specialty is Roasted Pig.

You can also pre-order a roasted baby pig for special occasions - just make sure you order ahead of time!

Get it \"take-out\" because the portions are big and you can always finish it later.. 

Their are other same BBQ places in the same food court, but this is one with the line-ups and the others are always empty. Make sure you wait and order the Roast Pig."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my parents to satisfy a craving for quick, cheap and comforting Chinese food. This place never disappoints and the prices are amazing, especially for the quality and quantity of food. We ordered the bbq pork over ho fun (flat, white noodles) and enjoyed the complimentary soya bean milk on the side. Don't forget to load up on the flavorful house-made chili oil!"}
{"text":"Awesome crispy pork and rice combo. Can always see a line up/crowd in front of the store. It's mostly people waiting for their orders. If service was faster at this place I would come here more often than their competitor two shops down.
I am a fan of their crispy pork. Not really a fan of their duck, not roasted well enough. Would recommend a lunch here. Yum."}
{"text":"Always busy but very good.  Competitor just two stalls down and they still do well.  Where else can you get an unprocessed meal for the $6-7 range?  Business model is for sure based on speed and value.  Judging by the horde of people I see, Im guessing many agree.  The line moves fast but come before noon to lessen your wait."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Definitely not even close to the best Chinese be I've ever had. The bbq was far too lean, the duck was soggy, fatty and hardly had any meat on it. Definitely not a bargain at $6."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located in the food court at First Markham Place. There were ample parking spots outside. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
The cashier was very friendly! She smiled a lot and my order came pretty quickly as well. 

[DÉCOR] - 3/5 
Nothing fancy. The place fills up during peak hours for lunch & dinner, but there are plenty of seats in the food court. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
BBQ Pork was pretty high-quality and the the char was so flavourful and delicious! Quality of red sausage was average, but it was prepared well as it was nice and soft to contrast the tougher BBQ pork. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Red Sausage & BBQ Pork on Rice - $6.20: BBQ pork was marinated and barbecued until it became perfectly smoky, red sausage was soft, and the sauce was quite delicious. My only complaint was that the sauce just a tad too salty. The meal also came with a Chrysanthemum tea, and it was a sweet and refreshing drink to pair with the meal. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
I came here because I came to the food court a tad late and Extra BBQ House closed for the day. I decided to try this place instead, and the BBQ Pork from here was nicely charred and delicious! However, I preferred the sauce from Extra BBQ House because it is a thicker and sweeter than the one from HKS Barbecue & Noodle House. But overall, I was not disappointed in HKS and would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Garbage quality pieces of BBQ. Ordered takeout of BBQ duck and char siu. The char siu was burnt black and did not even looked like any recognizable meat. I wouldn't even feed it to my dog."}
{"text":"SO wanted some meat so we decided to try this place. Got the cow stomach(?) and duck. The duck was tasty and juicy. The cow stomach was marinated well."}
{"text":"Extremely sad that they were out of crispy pork belly (??) when I went with my girlfriend. Crispy pork + roasted duck are my go to but I had to settle for duck and charsiu. Whatever sauce they pour over at the end is crack, and makes even the accompanying wilted vegetables delicious. Duck and charsiu were juicy and nostalgically satisfying. Chased it all down with a cup of cold chrysanthemum tea. Quality of the cuts we were given were all good. Portion size/value is extremely good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq rice combos that will leave you stuffed!

Among the bunch of great places to eat at the First Markham Place food court, this place hits the spot for the bbq craving. The menu has the usual variety of BBQ pork, duck, chicken and roast pork which you can buy by weight. But the standout are their rice combos - I ordered the BBQ pork and roast pork combo on rice with includes a drink and some veggies. To my delight, $7 bought me a huge plate of yummy bbq meats on rice - you could easily share it with 2 people and be full. The BBQ pork was tasty while the roast pork had nice crispy skin. Some of meat was a bit fatty. I will definitely return to try the BBQ duck and chicken as well. They also have daily specials which make it a great budget eat. Overall, if you have a BBQ craving - this is the spot to go and you will not be hungry while having extra cash for dessert!"}
{"text":"3 stars for convenience and closeness to home. Must reheat food after you bring it home if you buy takeout at dinnertime.  Very lean duck, very lean pork."}
{"text":"Good:
Duck - Nice flavour on the duck, not overly lean.

Neutral:
Cha siu - Pretty standard, nothing really stood out.  Got a decently fatty piece this time.

Worth it?
Not much to say about a food court place but that it's worth it.  $7 all in for duck and cha siu with a gigantic portion of rice and a drink is the definition of true value."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss?

Some days I get really good and tasty meat. Some days for roasted pork could be soaking in fat and oil with no meat.

Good place to pick up BBQ meat rice combo for lunch when you are in First Markham Place. But I would carefully look at what available hanging at the window before ordering or I would make special request before they start chopping up my meat.

Cash only"}
{"text":"Cheap and good Chinese bbq restaurant. Always has a line up.that says everything..."}
{"text":"my friend and i have been on a mission to try as many chinese BBQ places as we can... and to rate each of them.

I was shocked to find that my favorite BBQ place (not full restaurant) is this location in first markham place. 

as a seasoned veteran of \"fan hups\" aka bbq rice lunchboxes.. i can say that HKS BBQ has some decent quality BBQ items.  did i mention.. all you can get ginger and green scallion oil...   other places charge 50 cents or more for this!

Ho ho BBQ at micnicol and midland comes in at second ... however, they are only good because of the service and extra bonus pieces they always give.. in terms of taste, i think they are good but not the best.

Sure, i have found a cockroach roaming around the floor in front of HKS BBQ, but what chinese place doesnt have cockroaches..."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Such great food for an even greater price! Their specials like the bbq pork or duck on rice are all around $5 and the portions are huge! I always have trouble finishing and need to share with someone! The taste is very authentic and the meat is cooked perfectly! It is a must have when going to the fmp food court! There is always a line-up indicating their popularity and loyal customers!"}
{"text":"amazing value and amazing taste - for 6.50 i got a huge box of rice, veggies, roast pork with bbq sauce, and a soup. if you add 75 cents you can get another choice of meat. It will definitely fill you up and it will taste absolutely delicious.

my favourite is the roast pork and the bbq duck."}
