{"text":"Pretty disappointed with Le Ninja. 

The portions are small, the food is a bit pricey and nothing special. The online menu doesn't match the menu in the restaurant, multiple items were omitted. 

I had the octopus salad in wasabi sauce and the beef ramen. The octopus salad is strange, very little octopus and way too much wasabi sauce. The beef ramen doesn't use ramen noodles. 

Go for the decor."}
{"text":"We checked their website menu and It looked like they had a lot of options which was why we chose that restaurant. 
We were disappointed to find out they changed their menu. The ramen was not available and they don't have the rice bowls with toppings. 
We ordered the $10 fried rice and it only had green onions and no other toppings. 
My wife ordered the Beef Bulgogi only had a few beef and it was all mushrooms. 
I ordered the Shrimp Tempura and they only gave me 3 pieces of shrimp and the rest were vegetable tempuras. 
We will definitely not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to be the first to review this gem. The atmosphere is uniquely authentic, with lots of greenery, beautiful ceramics and backed cushioned chairs. The food was brilliant, we had the butterfish, which melted in our mouth. The stand out dish for us was the salmon tartare, so so good! Oh and the deep fried icecream was a hit with our 6yr son!
This is a special restaurant which I predict will be a hot spot very soon!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night and was completely blown away. The chef is playing with some unique and intricate flavors, a really interesting interpretation of traditional Japanese ingredients. 

I would highly recommend ordering things you may not generally order, for example, the Black Cod was so unique, not something I would typically order, but I'm very glad that I did. 

The TareTare was the stand out.... when it arrived, it came with a wedge of lime, which was a simple, yet magnificent addition to an already complex, yet subtle dish. 

Watch this chef... I can only imagine that with his creativity, and clear love for the craft, that he has a very bright future. 

Try this place!"}
{"text":"I had the 4 course omakase and overall I was pleased with the results.  The first dish was a tasty jellyfish appetizer served with a daikon garnish.  The second dish was a well presented seared salmon sashimi salad served on field greens with a savory sesame oil dressing.  The third dish was a seared chasu pork served with grilled vegetables.  The pork was a tad overdone but the taste was enough to overcome this oversight.  Finally the last dish was an assortment of nigiri sushi with garnishes that well complimented the flavors of each distinct fish.  

The service was friendly and excellent in ensuring you were enjoying yourself and the decor provides for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"This is a very good place for new style sushi! Fresh fish,good service,and delicious! Nice restaurant!"}
{"text":"Took a chance and swung by Le Ninja when i was craving a light dinner, but wanted sushi. I decontructed octopus salad, is by far very unique. the server said it was spicy, but to be honest it isnt. its just a slight wasabi flavor on the nori. there is a decent amount of octopus chunks, that are chilled and fresh. nothing is chewy about it.  onto the rolls... theres about 7 rolls here to choose from. very small menu to be honest. i ended up getting the quebec roll and boy was i happy. 8 large pieces of perfectly constructed pieces of sushi with rice. the salmon on top was sliced perfectly and cradled each piece. the crab, and avocado were fresh and paired well with the tomatoe. yes there was a tomatoe piece in there! also the touch of creamy, and sweet creamcheese was delish. to top it off, there was a thinly sliced freeze dried strawberry i believe? ovarall, it was a beautiful meal with good service.

props to the ninja kitty painting on the wall!"}
{"text":"Recently I've been coming to highly rated restaurants on Yelp but have not had the same experiences as others...guess this streak of unfortunate luck followed me to Le Ninja recently because as excited I was to try to based on the great reviews, I left thinking that I should've just eaten at home instead...

Came here with hubby on a Saturday night and should've turned around and walked away when we saw that the restaurant was completely empty except for one another table at dinner time but we didn't and were quickly seated. We took a quick look at the menus and ordered the following items: guava sour, octopus salad, ebi shrimp, sweet potato truffles fries, salmon tamago roll, Montreal roll, kamikaze roll, avocado roll, and the mermaid roll. 

The first item to come out was the guava sour and man what a disappointment it was! Definitely didn't taste the guava and for almost $10 this drink was a fail for the two of us (yes.. we both ordered the same drink - that's how excited we were about it)

We then got the octopus 'salad'...I don't even know where to start with this one. I guess I'll express my dismay at the fact that this was literally one tablespoon and a half of food. No jokes. It came in a tiny ramekin with a small teaspoon for you to add the contents to a sheet of seaweed to eat and it was literally finished after 4 teaspoons. Then comes the flavor. All you could taste was extreme spice.. the kind that burns yours eyes and nose as you chew (and I can handle spice). This dish was literally -10 stars. Ridiculous portion for $7, barely any octopus in there, and no flavor except for a crazy hot spicy experience. Stay away from this one.

Then came the shrimp which was a welcomed surprise. Delicious, perfectly cooked, and extremely yummy, this was hands down the best dish of the night! Nothing bad to say except I wish I could eat that dish all day. 

The sweet potato fries we sweet potato fries. So that should be enough of a description for that one. 

The rolls were... a hit or miss. Some delicious, some horrible, but definitely nothing to write home about.

In a nutshell, this place is overpriced and not well flavored so I can't recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem! The food is incredible and very unique. The service was a bit awkward but it seems like they're still new. I'll definitely come back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty delicious sushi place.  I had the salmon tamago which was done right. The sake was solid.  However I wasn't too crazy about the tempura; I should have been willing to wait 25 minutes for the gyoza. 
Know that this place isn't your traditional Japanese restaurant (the interesting cocktail menu was a dead giveaway) but be prepared for those cocktails and interesting sushi combos."}
{"text":"This place is intimate and modern. An upscale sushi place. Very fresh. Creative, great service.
Small bar but friendly (4 or 5 people max). They have a full bar. 
Feels local and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker when i was in Montreal for work last week. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance and a decent amount of space. We had tuna tartar, a sushi roll and a bowl of ramen. I had the ramen and tartar, and i got to try my counterpart's sushi. All three dishes were excellent. The ramen was rich, warm, and balanced, the tartar delicate and delicious, and the sushi was excellent. It is a little pricey overall, and we each had a glass of wine, $11 for 5oz i think it was, which is a heck of a markup. Wish the cost was a little less overall, hence only 4 stars, however the dishes are excellent and worth a try."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Great ambiance, atmosphere. The food is absolutely delicious and amazing. They are satisfactory and thorough in service. Cozy place to go with friends.

J'ai adoré cet restaurant, les sushis sont délicieux étale service est excellent. Les sashimi sont tellement fresh."}
{"text":"The maki was tasty and creative, but the shashimi was not considered as good quality. We tried the ama ebi and uni as they were the special for the day, but not quite sure if they were 100% fresh."}
{"text":"Nice decor, quiet and pleasant atmosphere with good service. We ordered sashimi and maki. The fish was fresh but unfortunately the rice was not cohesive and fell apart to the touch. Sacrilege for sushi!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 here today and we ran pretty much through the whole menu. Everything was amazing and the service was top notch also. Whether you like Sashimi, sushi or bbq'd pork or chicken, this is the place to go and try out. Loved it and will be back for sure!! Well done guys!!"}
{"text":"Despite some hiccups in service (they were very understaffed when we went), the sushi and miso soup we're both terrific.  Staff are very nice.

This is not kid friendly.  Kids allowed, but basically nothing for them to get."}
{"text":"Great find in down town Montreal. Friendly , efficient service and nice decor . Food was great. We had Karaage  , shabu shabu salad, Salmon tartar and miso soup as appetizers . All very good, the miso soup had great flavour. We chose 4 different Makis and they were all excellent. Most were done with soy paper and some had no or little rice .We had the salmon tamago, mermaid, phoenix and Montreal . We will def. be back and hey with no guilt either as the choices are actually healthier than some other Japanese places."}
{"text":"The interior decor of this place is superb. Even the menu design is unique and fun to play with. The classic sushis are creative and fresh, such as the blueberry roll. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon Tamaga and they were outstanding! Along with that I got some miso soup and finished my dinner off with some green tea ice cream. Great service as well. Wish I could go again soon! Definitely recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Chef is good, but management and ambiance and waitresses need more updates and training."}
{"text":"The sashimi was amazing! It was prob one of the best I've had! I sort of wish I ate here everyday! The staff were very sweet and offered free sake when they found out we were tourists, looking for a late night dinner in the rain. Thanks, for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"I had so much fun at le ninja! It was a bit dead for a Fri night but I feel it's because not many people know about this hidden gem yet. I took one of my best friends here for her B-Day. She chose the resto based on reviews. I had never heard of this place. We were in time for the 2 for 1 special on asahi and sake bottles so of course we went to town!! I want to say I ordered three two for one orders but I can't be sure because I was pretty intoxicated by the end of the night. Lol At one point we couldn't finish the sake and we had the waiter and one of the owners , Yo Yo, help us finish the bottle. They were all so nice. Yo Yo even gave us some plum wine. It was a lot of mixing but oh so fun! Now enough about the drinking! Here's the low down on the food... my friend and I shared the salmon tartare and the pork Gyoza. The salmon tartare was good. The gyoza was not memorable. To me what was most memorable were the sushi rolls. One had blueberry on it! It was called the Phoenix and consisted of deep fried crab meat, avocado, white fish mixed with tempura and yogurt mayo and avocado topped with spicy mayo and a blueberry. I was very hesitant about this. I had never seen a sushi roll like this before and I don't like mixing fruit with salty food but the waiter recommended it and I trusted him. It was surprisingly really good! It was better than I expected and it wasn't too sweet. It was a good balance of sweet and salty. This roll was better than the other sushi roll we ordered. I think it was the salmon tamago sushi roll. Later on in the night we shared the beef ramen because we needed some carbs to soak up the alcohol. Lol It was good. The place is nicely decorated, the food is good, the location is downtown, the staff and owner are fun and friendly ... what more can you ask for ?! I recommend this place for a date night or a good place to pregame before a night out on the town."}
{"text":"Ninja is one of a kind, very chic and original, but don't expect to leave paying less than 30-40$ per person. Everything is à la carte and their menu is a scroll made with silky cloth (how fancy), I was very impressed by the presentation of everything they prepared and the service was amazing! The interior decor was really nice and the noise level was low, very suitable for dinners among small group of friends and couples.

We took a seven courses try-it-all set menu dinner for two (50$/ person), and every dish was presented with upmost care and delicacy. Appetizer was wasabi octopus with seaweed, then a variety of tempura, main courses include three dishes of raw and cooked fish, sushi and sashimi. Each dish is a piece of art. In terms of taste, I liked everything except the dessert, which was a plain looking homemade green tea ice cream. However overall, it was an amazing dining (and visually pleasing) experience!"}
{"text":"Love this cute little sushi place in downtown Montreal. Coming from Hawaii with lots of fresh fish, this place didn't disappoint. Owners are Chinese but the sushi tasted just as awesome. Another interesting fact is the cook inside who takes care of the hot food is Japanese - so you're in good hands for everything! 

The rolls were all made with thought and tasted wonderful. We ordered the beef ramen, bibimbap and the Alaskan black cod for hot food. The cod was fantastic in flavor and fish quality. But the ramen is more like Chinese noodles and not Japanese style. So if you want authentic Japanese ramen, don't order that. Bibimbap was great! 

Oh, there's also a wide variety of drinks to choose from. That always make the meal better. 

Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This creative, cozy little chef owned restaurant is something you should try in the Concordia ghetto. The fish is very fresh and every sauce is well thought of to marry the flavour of each dish. The fried chicken's batter was cruncky and the chicken very juicy, the beef and squid were also tasty and made a great starter for the sushi and sashimi to come. It also might be the best tempura in town, the batter was extremely airy and cruncky, the sweet pepper made an impression on me. I loved the sashimi presentation, a whole red snapper fish head and tail with layers of fresh sliced flesh it, it was so fresh. I am ready to be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"this is the worst sushi restaurant in Montreal, so expensive yet the salad is not fresh at all and not fill me up. Won't come again."}
