{"text":"Meh is the perfect summation for my dinner from this place.  If it weren't for an online voucher granting me $40 worth of food for $20 I doubt I would have ever heard of this place let along ordered from them.  The voucher promised free delivery so it was too good to pass up, though it turns out that it was also too good to be true since we were charged for said 'included' delivery.  But nevermind that, I know that gas and employees cost money so I moved past the surcharge to focus on the food.  I started with a tom yum mushroom soup, which I ordered large to share with my partner but my guess is that they only have one size of soup container because I think we barely received 12oz of soup; it tasted alright but was nothing to write a glowing review about.  Entree sizes on the other hand were quite large but unfortunately fell into the well known quantity-over-quality trap.  My vegetarian pad thai had been adulterated by the ketchup short-cut reminiscent of fast food.  One of my dinner companions order the Monsoon, seafood fried rice, which appeared to simply be steamed rice without any additional seasonings and reportedly tasted as bland as it looked.    In the end we were full of mediocre food, but full nonetheless."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night for dinner. This is not a restaurant that you would go out of your way to visit. The food here is not bad and can't complain about the service.  This is a good go to if you just want take-out or want to grab a bite alone. I wouldn't reccomend bringing a date here. The restaurant conists of a row of seating by the windows and two small couches along on opposite walls to eat on. There is also a large lcd TV facing one of the couches. There did not seem to be any airconditioning. The door was left open to let the breeze in.   There was only one lady working as both the cook and cashier (I am guessing must have been the owner/or family of the owner). A small child, who I assume was her son was lounging on one of the couches colouring and watching TV.   The pricing is fair. It was $10.95 for a chicken & shrimp pad thai, and $5.95 for 2 fresh salad rolls. They also had a special going on, $6 for rice with kung pao chicken.   The wait time is very short. My meal was ready in less than 10min. The quality of the food itself was pretty good, but to be honest the only other thai food I've had before this is at Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"Bland food. Owners are rude and refused to fully honour coupon. On top of the awful food, I was charged a dollar per item more than the website prices."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this restaurant for the first time recently and I am happy to report that every dish we tried we loved. Our server was the nicest man and very helpful. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't recommend. The food is about as good as a Thai booth in a food court. Delivery was cold and they forgot the sauce."}
{"text":"Honestly, just don't go here.  Since most of the people who commented before me ordered dishes other than curries, I decided to give the restaurant a shot: unfortunately, my experience was not good at all.  I ordered the red beef curry and my husband had the green chicken curry. I have no idea where they get their chicken because I've never seen so much fat on chicken before. Their beef was a bit better, but it looked to me like it was still pretty fatty, only most of the fat had dissolved into the sauce. The sauce itself was average at best.  If you're on this street, i recommend driving down a ways to visit Thai Naka: tastes so much better and is for sure healthier; they also have better specials (more options) in my opinion."}
{"text":"This breeze blows. We ordered for take out and I honestly think its the worst Thai food in Toronto. The beef satay was totally burnt, not to mention cold. The chicken green curry had maybe three pitiful bits of chicken in a soggy, thin tasteless broth. The pad thai was the only thing edible in the whole meal. Horrible."}
{"text":"I've been 3 or 4 times and like the food.  The people who work there are really friendly, as well.  I have had veggie pad thai, the veggie platter and a fried tofu dish and would order all again in a heartbeat.  This isn't a sit down restaurant, there are only one or two small tables.  Take out is your best bet."}
{"text":"If I had one word to describe the food here, it'd be \"okay\". I got a takeout from OrderIt, which included Coconut Shrimps, Golden Beef Curry, Coconut Rice, and some Coconut Shrimp soup. The coconuts shrimps and rice were pretty good, but the rest kind of falls apart. The beef curry tasted like something out of a pre made package. The spiciness was a bit more than what I'd preferred (it didn't ask me how spicy), so I couldn't really taste the deep favors. And the soup doesn't taste anything like coconut. It tastes like hot and sour soup but without the thick consistency.   It was just \"okay\"; not bad but not great. I've had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon to give this restaurant a try. The food gave me stomach ache. Be careful if you ever think about giving it a try."}
{"text":"This is the closest restaurant to me.  I go here about once a month. The food is ready pretty fast and the prices are reasonable.  They have a wide selection of Thai food. They also have a 20% discount if you order more then $35 worth of food and pay with cash.  They also have daily specials written on a sandwich chalkboard, usually the special is about $6. The owners are Sri-Lankan and very friendly.   This is not the best place for a sit down meal unless you're coming alone and want a window seat. I particularly like coming here because I know that I am supporting a mom and pop operation versus a big chain such as Spring Rolls and Thai Express--which I still go to from time to time."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 chances to \"wow\" me and no such luck. For the quality of food given, it is way overpriced. The food wasn't cooked thoroughly and parts were still cold. Would never recommend this place."}
