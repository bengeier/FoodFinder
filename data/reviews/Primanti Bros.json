{"text":"Das Primanti Bros. ist u.a. für seine Pitts-Burger bekannt. Es begann als Trucker-Kneipe in den 30ern und hat sich mittlerweile zu einer ganzen Kette entwickelt. 
Wie mir Einheimische erzählten war das Ziel, ein ganzes Mittagessen komplett zwischen zwei Scheiben Toast unterzubringen. 
Das ist ja schon sehr praktisch, wenn man Steak, Salat und Fritten direkt auf einmal in sich reinschieben kann und es einem nichts ausmacht, wenn man von einem Ohr bis zum anderen mit dem halben Belag dekoriert ist.
Ich hab mich dann für die Variante 'Tuna' (6.50$) entschieden, was sich allerdings nicht gerade als sinnvoll erwiesen hat. Vielleicht wars der Jetlag oder das leckere Sam Adams, bei Tuna hatte ich an ein Thunfisch gedacht. Nun ja, es war eher eine Thunfischpaste oder sowas, mit Krautsalat, Fritten, Gurken und was weiß ich nicht alles.
Hat eigentlich nur noch die Apfeltorte obendrauf gefehlt.
OK, es war ein sehr lustiger Abend. Das junge Personal hatte auch seinen Spass, als wir das ganze auf Bildern festgehalten hatten.
Restaurant würde ich es nicht nennen. Mit der ganzen Baseball/Basketball Dekoration und den zahllosen TVs an den Wänden, Spielautomatem (und passenderweise gleich dem Geldautomaten daneben) läuft es bei mir eher unter Schnellimbiss.
Auch war man mit der Tischreservierung für 12 Personen schon etwas überfordert.
Es gibt auch eine reichhaltige Auswahl an Vorpseisen (4-5$; gefüllte Jalepenos, Nachos, Hühnchenstreifen, Champignons, ..., natürlich alles schön frittiert). Die Preise sind für diese Art Schnellimbiss durchaus OK."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is definitely a Pittsburgh institution. If you are traveling through, you definitely have stop here, at least for the novelty factor. Overall, food is good for a... well, for a sandwich shop... But in the end, I didn't leave with a sense that I really had to come back. 

The real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... \"who cares\".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. 

The ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. 

On the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich. In the end, Primanti Brothers is a definite must try if you are passing through, but I don't see myself craving these babies any time soon."}
{"text":"This spot was the light of my life for about 3 solid weeks. From the first bite I could tell that parting ways with Pittsburgh would be heartbreaking. After driving out of pittsburgh and paying my friend for his leftover half a sandwich, I knew that id made a special connection. To that bacon egg and cheese waiting for me, I miss xou and cant wait to hold xou again."}
{"text":"I had the colossal fish with fries on the side.  Husband had the #2 best seller, The Pitts burger.  Too much breading on the fish and drenched in grease.  Fries were limp and cold.  Cole slaw was very tasty.  Husband says the Pitts burger was lame, nothing special.  The staff was friendly but service was terrible.  We arrived at 1:30, waited 15-20 minutes to be seated, 5-10 minutes for the waitress to take our drink order.  She was helpful with the menu as we had never eaten here before  When we finished, it took 10-20 minutes for the waitress to bring us the check.  We've seen Primanti Bros on the Travel Channel and were very anxious to try it.  We tried it but will likely never go back.  I'm still belching the fries!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once and that was on my last visit to Pittsburgh.

I was really excited to eat there considering its reputation.

The atmosphere was really nice and relaxing. There was a nice mix of people, from the young to the elderly.

I honestly think the sandwiches would be better if they put a little less coleslaw but that's obviously personal taste.

I'd go back again when I'm back in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I went because I heard it was a staple in Pittsburgh...We waited about 30 minutes to get in yesterday. After getting in, the atmosphere was good and fast...but the food, well, it was very unseasoned and plain. Nothing said \"wow\". I was told afterwords that it is a place to say you went, but not a lot of people knew them for their food...just a name...I agree...Next time I visit Pittsburgh, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Restaurant has been open for 1 month and the kitchen still can't keep up. There is 20 min wait and 25% of the tables are empty because the kitchen can't keep up. 
Is this due to inexperience or poor management?
Food was good; wait staff did a great job - just took a long time to get our food and it didn't all come at the same time. 

Went back a couple of weeks later and things were a lot better!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh original sandwiches, coleslaw and fries on the stack!! Can't go wrong with a Capicola, Cheese and fried egg on the sandwich."}
{"text":"You know a restaurant and it's famous sandwiches are good when a reviewer from Philadelphia and a Washington Capitals fan can admit that these are uniquely delicious.

Primantis is a staple of Pittsburgh culture. Yes, a sandwich can be that influential. When I visit a Primanti Brothers restaurant, I tend to order the Cajun chicken sandwich because it's simply that good. Well prepared chicken, home made coleslaw, crisp French fries. It doesn't take complex algorithms to understand that this combination is heavenly.

The service at the Monroeville location is very good. I know a lot of the servers and everybody who's waited on my friends and I have always had a cheerful demeanor. The food is served promptly as well. One quick tip for this particular location: don't rest your beers near the edges of the warped tables, unless you have quick reflexes.

One of the reasons I frequent Primantis as often as I do is the Penguins and Steelers game specials. Get your wonderfully mediocre IC Lights for as cheaply as they're made. In all honesty though, the specials here are extremely competitive. You can easily get a quality dinner and a few beers during a hockey or football game for around $10 - which is impressive for this city. Especially at an establishment that won't require Tetanus shots after.

Out of towners, add \"Grab a Primantis Sandwich\" to your list of things to experience when you're in Pittsburgh. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for several years, and in the last 6-8 months this location has gone to 'hell in a handbasket'!  Three times in a row it took over 15 minutes before anyone came to our table.  Then my sons pizza was caked with flour,  it was SO horrible!  I really hope they get it together - I'm really close to being done with them, it's sad - used to love this spot!  My daughter goes to dance across the street.

I appreciate your response, BUT that is exactly what you said the first time I posted a not great review and nothing changed - seriously?!?!?"}
{"text":"Bread was cold, portion was small, quality of the meat was poor.  They are riding on their brand...a rip off."}
{"text":"In town on travel, we shared a pastrami and Pittsburger with cheese fries .... well, let's start with the fries -- they are cooked in peanut oil; either the oil was previously burned or the oil needed to be changed because the fries literally tasted like rancid peanuts -- not to mention none of the fries were salted. 

The \"meat\" on the pittsburger was like a hamburger patty you buy at a discount grocery store's frozen freezer. Or it also reminded me of an elementary school's burger. 

The bread was good. The pastrami meat was good. The coleslaw was OK -- but a too vinegary for my taste. 

The sandwich looks awesome, but the taste of the bland, rancid peanut flavored fries turn it into junk."}
{"text":"Primanti bros..... a sandwich shop where everyone I talked to said was probably the greatest thing you'll ever put in your mouth, a sandwich like no other. Their is no competition and never will be any competition that can tear down Primanti bros success and deliciousness of their sandwiches. Well all of those people that I talked to, all of the people that wrote outstanding reviews, saying the sandwiches were \"majestic\" lied to me. This sandwich was an average sandwich, that personally I could have probably made one just as good or even better in my toaster oven. The sandwich was very filling of course but the flavours just did not mix together. The coleslaw was not the greatest, tasted to me very sour, the fries were alright but they put way to much on the sandwich in fact they should just leave them on the side and suggest to people to put them in or ask if they want them in. The meats in the sandwich were just regular meats, nothing special. The buns felt like a regular bun you could buy at your local grocery store. You coulda walked a couple more blocks and purchased a 12 inch cold cut combo from subway and woulda had a just as good sandwich there. Going forward this sandwich was not \"spectacular\" or \"majestic \"
As many people told me, I suggest something changes, and buy some new coleslaw. Prove me wrong please, please, please prove me wrong and show me that this sandwich place is the greatest, but from my experience it was just a regular, average sandwich."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh classic! A must try for anyone visiting the Burg and wants to participate in a long time favorite. You'll get a sandwich with fries and slaw topped on it in a tasteful fashion! If you go to the one on Carson you will get the Best experience!"}
{"text":"I like Primanti Bros, this location wasn't all I hoped and dreamed. Plus one star for being a Pittsburgh experience, minus a star for serving a mediocre version of it."}
{"text":"As a current West Coaster and soon-to-be Pittsburgh resident, I can safely say that I was made for this city.

One reason?  I love Primanti Brothers.  Granted, I've only been there once, but man did it hit the spot.  We got there right at lunchtime and barely hit any crowd.  Quick and friendly service, too.
I had the roast beef and I felt like crying because it was my perfect sandwich/food.  All of the elements I love in one place.
I can see how the food might be bland or uninspired for some people but I freaking loved it.  So there.  It had the perfect atmosphere, great people, and yummy stomach-filling food.  I look forward to many more Primanti trips in my future!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of all their sandwiches. Worth the drive from anywhere. And if you're a local and have never eaten here you don't know what you're missing. Definitely a lot of sandwich for the $.  A legendary Pittsburgh establishment through and through."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a long personal 'business' lunch about 2 weeks ago.  Not very busy and was able to choose a corner booth and server was quick to take my order and delivery my drink.  Had a beer (Victory Hop Devil) and a pastrami and cheese (double meat).  Took awhile to get my food for as empty as the place was.  Was $18 with tip, so a little pricey but when I'm only able to stop in every 6 months or so, so I can handle that."}
{"text":"Was here four years ago and was very excited to go back a few days ago.  Yes.  It's a touristy thing--fries and cole slaw ON the sandwich?!  I wish it was the standard, and not so much novelty.

The corned beef was great (I just wish there was more), got a fried egg on it, and I was very content.  The bread was great, the cole slaw was tangy, the fries were a little soggy for my taste but they work great on the sandwich.

I'd be back.  Next year, in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"\"Don't go there, it's touristy,\" native Pittsburghers told me.  But I insisted.  It was fantastic!  Sloppy sandwiches and greasy fries, but it was just what I didn't know I needed on a Saturday afternoon.  The staff was friendly, and even funny.  The food, while not of high quality, was delicious.  I loved it.  This place is going to be on my list of places to visit again.  It's cheap, it's quick and best of all it is tasty.  On a side note, the place was extremely well managed."}
{"text":"I saw primanti bros. on bizarre  foods America. Since my fiance and I were spending the weekend  in Pittsburgh,  I thought it couldn't hurt to try. I would recommend  this place as a one time visit only. It's kitschy and fun, but it's not great. You get a super soggy sandwich and rude, rushed service.  I had roast beef and cheese with tomato, Cole slaw and fries. Like I said, good to try,  but that's about it. Your check comes wrapped in your sandwich paper, and it's pretty much dropped on your table. Then you're forgotten.  Want a refill on your drink or a box? Too bad!  Prices are good and this location  seemed cleaning. But it's  a tourist trap. They make so much money, they don't have to worry about being nice to customers."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh staple with good (but unhealthy) food, prompt service, and a fun atmosphere. T"}
{"text":"Alright so being from Texas I'm used to lots of seasoning, lots of flavor, and lots of heat if things are supposed to be spicy.  This sandwich shop lacks all of those things.  This was my first shot at local food (I think it's local, that's what I was told), and definitely nothing to write home about.  They did have some decent draft beer options but no one in my group of 10 said they would come back.  Try another \"local\" joint if you have an option."}
{"text":"After reading this the people outside of Pittsburgh will hail me as their queen, and the people of Pittsburgh will want to wish I had never existed on Yelp, but I have to say Primanti Bros. is not living up to the hype generated by numerous segments on the travel channel and food network. 

I can't spend all my time on this review as I have many others on my cross--country adventure to tend to, but here are the high- and low-lights of my Primanti Bros experience:

1. The bread needs to be much thicker and substantial to hold the massive toppings inside. I need something better than wonderbread here.
2. The amount and quality of meat and cheese were not bad - no real complaints here.
3. I really liked the coleslaw because it was vinegar based.
4. Um, yeah I'm aware that it would not be a Primanti Bros. sandwich without the french fries, but first, can the french fries taste good (they were stale, mushy and lacked salt) and second, can you not make the entire sandwich taste like potato and cabbage? not pleasant.

Well that's the 411 folks. I'll never feel the need to come back but glad I did try one.

Also, cash only and the poor service (we waited forever even though there was no one in the restaurant) are not helping."}
{"text":"Delicious and quick. The Primanti's is a very small little sandwich shop that is always packed with people. Grab your first table and a waiter will take your order, the menu is on the wall. I got the pastrami after my waiter said its the best, believe me its delicious. My father got the Pittsburger cheesesteak, that was okay. The fish sandwich was eeeehhhh. I wouldn't get either again.
When you come here you must get cole-slaw and fries on the sandwich. Its the only way to go. If you're in Pittsburgh you must come. Its a classic sandwich place that will leave you totally satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"I go to this Primantis location frequently and always have great service and great food.  Not last night.  The main reason for my 1 star review was because of our horrible service.  I have been a server for 15 years so I completely understand that things can go wrong and I hardly ever complain or give bad reviews on service.  However, the mother/daughter team that \"took care\" of us last night should really not be doing anything with \"service\" in the job description.  

I would like to thank the manager Jason who was fantastic after we let him know how horrible our experience had been.  He handled the situation more than appropriately and because of him and ONLY because of him, we will be back.  Thank you Jason!"}
{"text":"Road tripped from Chicago for a conference and picked this location to try the famous sandwiches! We went during lunchtime with our toddler and it looked extremely busy/crowded but we were sat within minutes! They even parked our stroller in the back area of restaurant! 
Sandwiches were great! Chili cheese fries were a fabulous addition and $2.50 IC Lights were perfect!"}
{"text":"Maybe the expectations were too high, but I had a pastrami sandwich and I thought it was quite bland. The only flavors were vinegar and pepper. It was better with hot sauce, but I expected better."}
{"text":"The best Primanti's in town! Always good food and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and sat at the bar. The food was great and the service was superb!! All of the employees were genuine and seemed happy to be at work."}
{"text":"Primanti brothers makes some of the best sandwiches in the world, if youre not too concerned with your health.  This particular location is the most resturant-like of all of them, totally worth it."}
{"text":"pastrami,coleslaw,fries,pecan pie, hamburger,greek salad w/ lamb - very good"}
{"text":"This place is super famous.  You should try their famous sandwich/burger at least once to know what everyone is talking about.  The atmosphere is bar/tavern/dinner feeling and it's probably a good place to watch a sports game and pad the lining of your tummy if you're planning to have some beers/drinks with friends.  

We had the Pitts-burger and the pastrami sandwich.  Each sandwich comes with cabbage/coleslaw, tomato, cheese and fries with your choice of protein smashed between two big pieces of Texas style (thick) white bread.  You can add onions or fried egg.  We choose to add a fried egg.  

As with everything in Pittsburgh, the sandwich/burger was big and hearty.  And the combination of coleslaw, tomato and fries made it tasty.   That said, it's more like comfort food than a gourmet sandwich and is still bar/tavern dining. Definitely not something that i would recommend eating everyday if you're on a diet ;) or watching your vitals.

 The  original off the stripe tends to have a line out the door that sometimes goes down the street, so we opted to try the one on Forbes St. near university of Pittsburgh campus.  The food is the same at their locations.  My suggestion is to skip the line and go to another location. 

Net, I'm glad we ate their at least once."}
{"text":"I don't understand the big deal about these sandwiches. Why are they so famous? My husband came here with a friend and said the waitress was rude  and annoyed that they were talking past finishing their meal even though the place wasn't busy.

My husband brought a sandwich home for me and it was the chicken and cheese. The chicken tasted funny, definitely wasn't fresh. The fries were brown and burnt and the cole slaw was just cabbage and vinegar. I could make a better cole slaw than that!

My husband got the \"famous\" Pitts-burger and said it was just one slab of cheesesteak with no flavor. I felt that my sandwich also had no flavor. It was nasty. I could only take 3 bites and had to get something else for dinner, it's that bad. I do not recommend eating here, the sandwiches are nothing special!"}
{"text":"Primantis is what it is.  You either like the food or not.  I happen to like it.  The bar at this location has great drink specials."}
{"text":"This is pittsburgh, I eat her usually twice a day when in the burg. The sandwichs are good but this is food steeped in tradition and represents the city well. A sandwich for the people, and Adam Richmon should never set foot in primantis again. Primantis beaten by a sandwich from philly with broccoli on it? YEA RIGHT"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a Primanti's sandwich! Always get it with an egg and eat with a ton of hot sauce! Best food to eat-no matter what time of day. It's a Pittsburgh staple."}
{"text":"an efficient way to eat - meat, cheese, fries and slaw! all the food groups in one delicious huge bite."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Good prices,good food and big portions! My favorite thing to get are the cheese fries and sandwiches!... mmmmmmm yum"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure at first about the whole cole slaw and fries bit but once I tried it I wanted another one. I had the capp and egg last time and It was excellent. The cole slaw is not the typical type, it has a bit more zip from the vinegar which paired well with the cappicola. I enjoy the sandwiches so much that it is a \"must have\" every time I stop in Pitts. Other sandwiches to make note of is the pitts-burgher cheese steak, and the pastrami. The Iron City beer is not too heavy and is perfectly balanced. Word from the wise, if your looking to get in and out, game days are not the days you want to go. There is usually a line out the door. It's not too bad because the line does go relatively quickly but go on a Sunday afternoon if you want a real quick bite. Always two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"A fun Pittsburgh experience. A great variety of sandwiches and the fries are good. I like the Pitts-burgher and the Cajun Chicken sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Primanti's have great sandwiches!

This location is a bit small, but has friendly staff, a small bar and additional seating upstairs. The sandwiches come piled high with coleslaw and fries (A bit too much coleslaw in my opinion). Fantastic lunch place, I recommend the hot sausage sandwich."}
{"text":"After a couple hours of breaking ice I was really looking forward to a good bowl of chili. Figured I couldn't miss at primanti's.   While good, the bowl was not much more than a cup.  I remarked the portions have become small and the waitress informed me they've always been the same as long as she worked.  Must be new!  

Still good though."}
{"text":"I think the only reason this place is a big deal is because Pittsburgh tries really hard to make it one, but in reality it's nothing that special or amazing."}
{"text":"If you're going to go to Primanti's,the first time at least has to be the original!! :)  Gorgeous exterior and a cool vibe inside (though, girls, the bathroom is a little suspect...pee before you go!! :))."}
{"text":"Every food show that comes to Pittsburgh focuses its lasers on Primanti Brothers. Man Vs. Food loved it! Diners, Drive-ins & Dives raved about it! Native Pittsburghers raise it to Untouchable status. In fact, it seems nearly sacrilege to live in Pittsburgh and not love Primanti Brothers.

Quite frankly, though, there isn't much to love. I've lived in Pittsburgh for three years, and everyone who visits demands a trip to Primanti Brothers. So I take them. I've been more times than I care to admit, so I feel more than qualified to bash this place.

I'ma break it down for you piece by piece.

1. The Bread: Folks love the bread! It's thickly-sliced and freshly baked! It makes the sandwich unmanageably large, though; you spend more time mashing the sandwich into a fittable size than you do actually eating it. Additionally, the bread is so thick it overpowers the meat and sticks to the roof of your mouth in a most unpleasant manner. 

2. The Meat: Really bad quality. The \"steak\" is worse than Steak-ums. It's actually worse than the rubber mats that line the floor behind the bar. Saying it has flavor is a compliment. And the \"Big Fish\"? Gag. Van de Kamps. If that. 

3. The Cole Slaw: Tastes like cabbage that's been soaked in vinegar. It has crunch, but that's about all it has.

4. The French Fries. Meh. Bland. 

And all this is glopped together, sliced, and served, rather unceremoniously, on wax paper. 

Many see this as Down n' Dirty or Good Ol' Boy style. No Frills. Truly American. 

I see it as Not Much To Brag About."}
{"text":"Visiting relatives in Pittsburgh, I was told this was a must try.  For me, not so much.  I guess if you like greasy food that's all clumped together, ok.  Basically, it's meat, french fries, tomatoes and cole slaw piled btw two slices of italian bread.  While many have said it's huge, and yes it is, at first glance, it's mainly bc there are so many french fries in it, my corned beef was a bit skimpy on the actual meat.  The others I was with enjoyed it, but yeah, grease really wasn't what I was looking for.

I didn't expect to have a warm reception but our server was definitely on the rude side, I know you've probably had a long day, but hello, this is your job, try a little.

Cash only.  Most sandwiches were priced btw $6-7."}
{"text":"Had never been here but heard about from a friend and wanted to do the \"Pittsburgh\" thing.  Presentation is nowhere to be found, BUT it's not supposed to be. It's a sandwich for a quick bite.  On that count it's awesome.  It's a meal all combined into one: entree and sides put together.  Every sandwich has coleslaw in it (which some kids might not like) but it isn't the coleslaw you're used to. It's made with oil not mayonnaise so it tastes pretty good. Had the Pastrami Sandwich and it was good.  You can taste the fries first then the meat and finally some coleslaw flavor.  

Waiter was excellent and attentive. Patient with our bunch which was made up of 5 kiddos. He never made us feel like we had to hurry or anything, which was nice.  Cook even came up to see how we were doing and how food was, nice touch.  

If your looking for a quick bite, this is THE place."}
{"text":"Ordered a fish sandwich, the kid looked up at the menu and said \"huh?\". I said \"...A jumbo fish and cheese\". Silence, awkward stare. He looked up at the menu again, then took my partner's order.

Behind the counter, I noticed him chattering a bit with his co-workers, again looking up at the menu. After a few minutes, he returned to my table and said to me \"I'm sorry... what did you say you wanted?\" \"A fish sandwich\", I replied. \"Oh, it's just that no one really ever orders those...\" Great, I was sure this sandwich is going to turn out awesome.

About ten minutes later, our sandwiches arrived. All fine and dandy, except my friend did not order a sandwich. She ordered garbage fries or some facsimile thereof. He apologized for the mistake, looked understandably embarassed and returned with her correct order a few minutes later.

Now these garbage fries... they were a sight to be hold. More like fry soup. The paper boat was literally sopping with liquid, and I'm surprised it didn't capsize in its own goop. The cheese was more like campbells cheese soup from a can, completely liquid, and drowning the doomed french fries. Not only could this cheese/fry mixture have easily been mistaken for a college culinary experiment gone horribly wrong, it was also bland as hell. Some things are ugly but taste great, and this was not one of them. Equally disappointing was the fact that the \"bacon\" was in fact \"bacon bits\", fake and salty little pink crumbs of preservatives.

After expressing distaste for our experience to a different waitress, and pointing at our uneaten fry/soup-boat, we were only met with \"Oh, whats wrong with it?\", and not a single mention of a refund.

Don't get me wrong, I've been here before and ordered more \"commonplace\" items I guess, and they've been stellar. We just had one rotten experience, maybe yours will be better."}
{"text":"My fiancé hates that I always want to come here being that I have ate these sandwiches my whole life but I can't help it as they are still one of my favorite things in this world.  If possible I would always recommend this location over all the other ones because I feel it's a better sandwich coming from the original location.  Love it."}
{"text":"Seriously?!?!?!  I was expecting the most amazing sandwich in the world after seeing this place numerous times on the food network.  Let's just say there are tons of better sandwich places out there.

I came here on a saturday around lunch time with a bunch of friends and had to stand outside in a line for about 15 minutes.  If it weren't for all the hype, I would have never waited in line for such a mediocre meal.

I don't understand why this place is so popular.  The bread is nothing special, just your ordinary white bread, which was soggy by the time the food comes out.  The fires were nothing special, just added carbs.  The sandwich was over-powered by the coleslaw, which i normally like.

I tried the pastrami, hot sausage, and steak sandwich, and all were definitely not worth the hype.  They all came out soggy and tasted like coleslaw.

My recommendation is to come to this place if you are truly interested in all the hype you see on the food network, but don't come in expecting much."}
{"text":"Stopped in on reputation alone. Visiting Pittsburgh on a whim, briefly with some semi-locals. Pretty disappointed. Got the house famous Pitts-burger and the fries we're soggy, cheese non existent and the burger patty was grey and flavorless. The vinegar soaked slaw and hot sauce made it palatable. That was pretty much the consensus of all of us at the table. Too bad, really. I'm sure this place used to be the bomb but today was not the case. The Dogfish IPA was the best thing consumed."}
{"text":"A good cheap 24 hour sandwich place. Fast, fresh and authentic food. Not that friendly quick service but still good for what it is. My favorite is the turkey sandwich"}
{"text":"Cole slaw on a sandwich: yum!  I'm pretty neutral on the fries.  Not a fan of the \"cheesesteak\" (it's a square-ish patty... thing =\ ).  Usually I get the roast beef w/cheese, which is awesome.  Come hungry, or share a sandwich and sides.  Pickles are great on the side.

Aside from the food: Be aware if you're squeamish that it's not the cleanest place around.  It's questionable whether they've ever cleaned the floor.  It can actually be difficult to make it out the front door due to your shoes slipping on the grease.  I find this pretty funny though...."}
{"text":"Has the signature Primanti brothers sandwiches.  Great service.  Convenient to many hotels near the air port."}
{"text":"Very similar and yet a bit different from the flagship Primanti Brothers in the strip.  The downside is that the signature sandwiches taste just a little different than at the original Primanti Bros. (or the others downtown or in Oakland).  I thought the bread was thinner and less fresh, and it's possible the fries and coleslaw had a slightly different flavor.  The upside is that the sandwiches are still pretty tasty, and there are a lot of positive differences.  The menu is much broader than at the original Primanti Bros., including all kinds of bar food, kid's choices, etc.  The ambiance doesn't have the gritty charm of the strip district, but it's roomier, easier to park, and still has a definitively Pittsburgh feel, with the Pens or Stillers always on the TVs, and plenty of sports memorobilia.  The final kicker, and it's a nice one, is the beer selection, including a Dogfish 60-minute IPA which you can get for a couple of bucks at happy hour.  Primanti Bros. Harmar is like life in the burbs: maybe less cool than dan-town, but pretty good living especially if you know what you're doing."}
{"text":"What can be said about Primanti Brothers? It's open 24 hours for one thing! Finding late night food in isn't easy. I ordered the Pittsburgh cheesesteak - their best seller and enjoyed it thoroughly. I normally despise coleslaw, but the Primanti employees were insistent it was different than any slaw I've tasted before and when in Rome, do as the Romans. I admit, I actually liked the slaw on cheesesteak, on fries, on fresh italian bread combo. Not as good as a Johnny's cheesesteak in Philly, but unique in its own way and worth a go.

The downside? Somewhat sketchy neighborhood at night. Armed guard at the door, some dude getting pepper-sprayed in handcuffs just a few doors down. And if you don't drive yourself there, good luck getting a cab. There were cabs in the area, but if you aren't going out to the burbs, they won't even pick you up. Pitt has a cab shortage and they are picky as hell about who they pick up and where they'll go. It isn't a reflection on Primanti Bros, but a general warning for those looking to venture down there late night.......make sure you have a lift home."}
{"text":"A must in the area. Any sandwich is the way to go. Gyro especially good. Also Victory beer on tap."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular location a few times and it's been great! The service was so-so but the times i've been it was always loaded, bursting at the seams with people. The food is yet to disappoint. In all honesty i expected more from the slaw on the sandwich, but ill still go back every chance i get."}
{"text":"Try the bacon, egg, and cheese. It is an absolute must. I've had just about every sandwich on their menu. All of them have been good except the Pitts-Burgher. I can't stand it. My husband and kids love their pizza. It is really good. Tuesday and Thursday nights they have a great pizza meal deal. Happy Hour is a great deal. Beware that food quality can vary from restaurant to restaurant."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros is everything they're hyped up to be! 

I went to Pittsburgh to watch a Charger vs. Steeler game and before I could leave this great city of Pittsburgh, I had to try a Primanti Bros sandwich. 

When we got there, the line was long and we had to wait a little while to grab a couple seats up at the bar (where you can watch them make the sandwiches). It took an even longer time for the server to actually make eye contact with us and take our order. Hence, we didn't come here for the service. 

When we finally got our sandwiches and side order of french fries loaded with cheese on top we were in heaven. I ordered the corned beef and cheese and my boyfriend ordered the turkey breast and cheese. Neither one of us were complaining about what we ordered, we were stuffed after eating 1/2 the sandwich. The french fries with cheese on top were finger-licking good! 

If you're in Pittsburgh, Primanti Bros is a must!"}
{"text":"Everyone says, \"Going to Pittsburgh?  Gotta go to Primanti Bros.!\"  So, we did.  And it's . . . okay.  Just okay.  Market Square is a fine setting, but the food (decent portions of fairly standard bar food) was only reasonably good."}
{"text":"We tried 2 of the popular sandwhiches... the Capicola w/ Cheese added egg and onion and the other was a Pastrami and Cheese..
Very pleased and satisfied. Servers were on point. Waitress made great suggestions and we followed. Great meal and great experience."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh and was told this is a must place to eat. With all the hype, I was expecting more. The sandwiches were just okay to me. I suppose it's a matter of opinion/preference (but hey, isn't all of yelp?) but I felt that the fries on the sandwich took away from the actual flavors of the sandwich. The fries weren't even hot. However the sweet and sour cabbage had great flavor. 

Now on the other hand, we also had some pizza and that was realllllllly good! I also thought the mixed drinks were overpriced and not that great. At least we were there during happy hour. 

In summary I don't want to diss Pittsburgh but I feel like this place is overhyped."}
{"text":"Ate in for the first time last weekend. I'm a frequent visitor to Pitt and this is the first time I've actually eaten at Primantis as opposed to taking out. I love this place!!! Love the wall paintings, love the casual atmosphere, and most of ALL, LOVE the sandwiches.  Got the Salami & provolone and it was amazing!! Service was great - and yes, our table was cleaned before we sat down. Waiter was very attentive to our needs. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Great new location! Neighborhood bar feel and expanded menu from other city locations. Friendly, fun atmosphere, and great food. 

We were there on a non-sports night, but would be a good place to watch a game, lots of TVs, good appetizers, and great drinks! Love the tots - nice and crispy."}
{"text":"by nature, primanti's is a love-it-or-hate-it place. the sandwiches have a unique taste  (cole slaw plus French fries plus meat) that is fantastic to me but some people might find it too extravagant."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a layover for lunch. Honestly had no complaints besides for everything is served on paper or plastic. 

The food was very good, and the waitress described the house specialties to us and helped with our ordering. Next time I will try the fry's and slaw on the sandwich. My coworkers looked very good! I ordered the gyro and wished it was a little larger."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros is my favorite local restaurant in Pittsburgh. I was scared of the fries and coleslaw on my sandwich at first, but it is awesome. I always order the Cajun chicken, but my friends all order something different and everyone is just as happy as I am. 

If you are headed to town and you are trying to choose between this Primanti and the one on University, choose this one. This one has a little bit better layout, the other used to be a Denny's."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is definitely worth the experience. French fries on a burger on jumbo soft white bread is a must if you visit Pittsburgh. It's one of a few classic Pittsburgh things ('Pittsburgh left'), even if it is perhaps the one that only a mother could love."}
{"text":"This place is really cool.The Pittsburgh trademark meal is a relish.It gets sometimes too crowded.Overall i would say an amazing place!!!"}
{"text":"Fries in a freakin sandwich. If that doesnt scream an America sandwich I dont know what does. Unfortunately all the hype let me down, but a decent sandwich"}
{"text":"We come here every so often. It's usually packed but the food and service have always been good. 

This review is directed toward the staff that took care of us for my son's birthday lunch. We ordered pizzas, 3 types of sandwiches, pitchers of drinks, etc. Our waitress (can't remember her name) was awesome and on the spot with everything. Overall, we fed 18 people for under $200 and it went flawlessly.  Everyone was helpful. The manager graciously answered ALL of my wife's questions over the phone. 

We will be coming back for more kid's parties in the back room."}
{"text":"You know what you are getting here. The gameday price for pizza is great. The Mt Lebanon location is good but always has a long wait for dinner."}
{"text":"well you gotta give this place a star for its originality. coleslow and fries in your sandwich.. sound good? its actually pretty intresting. the coleslaw isn't creamy its a big vinegry, so it doesn't soak ur sandwich. fries are good too, if eat them fast enough. i had the pastrami sandwich.......dude... YUM! its super good. the steak wasnt' so great though, i shouldn't have traded half my sandwich. its one of the better sandwiches i can remember eating. the place is packed though, and there was a steelers game going on, ive never seen so many steelers fans before. crazy. but this place is good, its cheap, and you get a crazy lot amount. eat here!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food! Katie and Vinnie greeted us with a smile. Katie was knowledgable about the unique menu. The food came out quick and hot. Loved the #2 Best Seller!"}
{"text":"The sandwich is stacked with fries, cole slaw, fried eggs, and fresh deli meats----get outta heeeeere!


I will definately come here again when I am in town."}
{"text":"This place is totally living on some outdated reputation. The sandwiches are weak. Basically a French fry and cole slaw sandwich with a shaving of meat and cheese. My husband tried to order his Pittsburgh cheesesteak ( really a burger and nothing like a Philly cheesesteak) without fries on top and the waitress was adamant that he shouldn't. Now we know why. Without the huge pile of greasy fries there'd be a sandwich of cole slaw mostly. I could barely find the turkey on my sandwich. Same goes for a pastrami sandwich my son's roommate ordered. 

My son just started at Pitt but I am certain that we will never return to this joint over the next four years. Oh yeah and the atmosphere is wretched too. Poor ventilation and you come out smelling like a fry."}
{"text":"Great place to stop and eat or for a drink. Only downfall is the lack of tables."}
{"text":"I know it's overrated but the sandwich is delicious. I've had the corned beef and pittsburgher cheesesteak versions and either is a good option. I think because the cheesesteak gives the sandwich more meat, I would go with that option.

The fries are crispy, the cole slaw is the best anywhere, and the bread is just soft and perfect. Primanti's is a must stop if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Service sucked big time on Monday, June 9, at the Primanti's in Market Square. It took more than a half hour for my wife to get a cheese steak and the place wasn't even crowded. Missed the first inning of the Pirates game as a result. Boo!"}
{"text":"We came to the original Primanti Bros. in downtown Pittsburgh off the strip. Busy and crowded but fast seating and service. Sandwich were exactly as we had seen on the food shows , big and delicious"}
{"text":"Highly recommended! Chicken Cajun is to die for.  You will never have more mouth watering cheese fries in all of Pittsburgh. The cheese fries taste like they were cooked with god's hands. Great place to chill with friends as you watch the game and chow down on some hot delicious hot wings!"}
{"text":"When I heard that the Primanti Brothers was known for sandwiches stacked high with cole slaw and fries, I thought it sounded disgusting. Don't get me wrong, I love fries. But fries in a sandwich? really? That's ridiculous. Also, I don't like cole slaw. Of course, since I was only here for a weekend, I HAD to try it.

I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and of course, I left it as is- stacked with cole slaw and fries. The sandwich was massive! I couldn't actually take a bite into the entire thing - I had to take it apart and take it in piece by piece. When I finally got a mouth full of everything, I was surprised. It was really good! I was surprised how tender and flavorful the chicken tasted and the fries were great! It's really just like having potatoes in your sandwich. Also, the cole slaw was not bad either. The thick bread was real buttery and tasty too.

Obviously not a healthy option but I would say Primanti Brothers is definitely something one should try in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I can't give the home of the garbage can sammich anything less than a five star and expect to be able to sleep at night!

I am going to build my list for Pittsburgh, as I grew up here and visit Mom often. So what better place to start than Primanti Bros!

I loved this place as a kid and still do! 
It almost makes the *bright and sunny * Burgh weather not sting that much!

Cheesesteak. Awesome! Hot sausage Awesome! Line.. Not Awesome.
But it's usually only bad at late night after the clubs close. This place  is to late night dining in Pittsburgh as Carne Asada chips and burritos are to late nught San Diego dining!

As you can tell from other reviews these sandwiches are unique to say the least, and I am pretty sure they come one way, the way they serve them!
But I love them that way. (If only they would open a shop in San Diego)

But I fear this will never happen... 
So I get my fill will I can while I visit Mom (Otherwise know as going to Steeler games!)

Large, tasty, flavorful sandwiched served on a thick *Texas Toast* style bread topped with cole slaw lettuce, tomatos and such.
Taste Great Late!! But are equally good other times as well.

Great addition opening a shop done at the stadium! Bravo guys!

Cheers
Daniel"}
{"text":"I love Primanti bros,but it says the place closes at 2 am on weekdays when in actuality it's 12am. BEWARE"}
{"text":"I love Primanti Bros. The restaurant appeared on dinners drive ins and dines. The mane thing they put on your burger is meat, cheese, fries, coslau. That's what they are know for but you can get it without all that stuff. Yes its a place for kids and yes they have TVs. I wouldn't really look at it as a bar. When you go there you must be really hungry. I would say you shouldn't have Attn in the last past 7 hours. i give pamanti bros a 5 thumbs up (IF I HAD FIVE THUMBS). Its also in walking distance from the steelers and the pirates Field."}
{"text":"I'm with others here - not a lover of Primanti Bros.  Sandwiches are fine (I have ordered the turkey and cheese) but the service is horrible.  Rude, arrogant, and just nasty.  Plus when is the last time a broom has been taken to the floors?  (I'm reviewing the Monroeville one here)."}
{"text":"Great interesting menu. Food was very good silverware scarce. The plastic ware was flimsy."}
{"text":"I was out of town in Pittsburgh, and I was told this was the place to go to get the PA experience.  The meal started off pretty well with $2 Yuenglings and amazing chili, cheese, sour cream and bacon fries.  However, things took a turn for the worse when the famous sandwiches came out.  Two of us had the turkey and one had the colossal fish.  I thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird.  The fries added almost no flavor to the sandwich, and the cole slaw was gross.  The bread was terrible, and overall, the sandwich made me nauseous.  Totally not worth it, unless you just go for the fries and drinks."}
{"text":"Ok I have been here twice. Both times were very poor. First time the server barely came by the table and we had unlimited wings. That was a waste of energy. This time the server entered our order wrong and it took over 45 minutes to get the wrong order. Then they remade it and took forever again. Finally the manager or who ever she was and offered to give us the wrong pizza which was not was brought to us the first time. WTF!!!!  I will not be back and would not recommend to anyone. To many excused from the server. I think the manager needs to train her staff....."}
{"text":"Came upon this restaurant just by riding around our hotel during our first night staying in Pittsburgh.  We saw the parking lot was completely full on a Tuesday night and knew they must be doing something right.  Come to find out, it's a pretty popular spot here in the area (and they were also running a Tuesday night pizza special.)

I got the black angus sandwich that was recommended to us by the waitress, because we just didn't know where to start.  Everything looked so good!  The sandwich was very unique, I'll give it that!  A steak sandwich with cole slaw, fries (yes, fries!) lettuce and tomato all stuffed between two slices of white, italian bread.  The cole slaw gave it a good touch and I was also just so intrigued by the fries coming ON the sandwich, but midway through, I realized that whole thing was really lacking the flavor and \"kick\" that I was hoping for.  Kind of bland after a while.  Maybe a better, more flavorful bread, or some different spices on the steak and/or fries would put this meal over the top.  Much potential!

On the other hand, my boyfriend got their single 3-topping pizza w/ pepperonis, sausage, and mushrooms and it was absolutely delicious!  If nothing else, we'll be back for the pizza.  Some of the best we've ever had.  

Great chili appetizer, too.  Wouldn't go out of my way to get it again, but it did satisfy the taste buds!"}
{"text":"The primanti sandwiches are different, but they are not as flavorful as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.
It just doesn't get better than a Primanti Brothers Sandwich with an Iron City beer.
Eating at the counter is a must.
This one is even better than the Primanti Bros on The Strip."}
{"text":"You either love a Primanti's or hate them I adore them, and adore them more after moving around the world and coming home. It's an insane amount of food, meat, french fries, sweet n sour cole slaw between two slices of really big bread but somehow it is magic. 

The strip district location is noisy and chaotic at night but that's just how  I like it. The suburban locations have good service that is more or less like any ordinary sports bar."}
{"text":"I've eaten at various Primanti Brothers locations, usually this one on Forbes, but they're all pretty similar.

First, it's a Pittsburgh institution, so I definitely recommend eating here if you're only in Pittsburgh for a few days.  It's unique, you get an unholy amount of food for pennies on the dollar.  In fact, for total calories per dollar, Primanti Brothers could compete in a national championship. 

On the other hand, you have to tell it like it is.  The service is horrible, and when they're busy (which seems like always), you will stand in line forever.  It's pretty impersonal, although it is impressive to watch the cooks.  It's also fun to listen to the arteries clogging all around you.
Just based on medical advice, I would not recommend eating here more than once in your life, but you should definitely eat here once."}
{"text":"went here while vacationing in pittsburgh. saw them on man vs food, so i went to this location where he went. i had to try the famous pittsburgh sandwich. the sandwich is  big. of course it's stuffed with coleslaw and fries. i got the #1 burger sandwich. the burger itself was fairly small. the sandwich was all around good though. the only thing that got to me was all the vinegar in the coleslaw. i had to take off half of the coleslaw because that's all i could taste. after doing that, i enjoyed it. no matter what you get here, it's cheap, under $6.50 .  there's also beer here. this location looks large on the outside, but is tiny on the inside. there is a small counter to sit at and a few tables. that's it. it's open 24 hours. it's just across the bridge from pnc park. (pirates). you can also take out."}
{"text":"Ok, the food was alright as far as taste is concerned, I have had much better, elsewhere. The service I got during a post-lunchtime visit (about 2 pm) was just blah! My server, a young, thin, dark haired boy, whom I will not mention his name, was pretty inattentive and just not happy at all. I must have ruined his day by sitting down and ordering. He was not a good \"server.\" I ordered a drink, he brought it, set it down and walked away.... could have taken my order.... but just turned, said nothing and strutted over behind the register and stood there, pulled out his cell phone and started texting.... was it about me... i dunno, but I sure felt unwanted there! 
After he finished his conversation, he returned to ask, \"what would you like?\" I said, \"The black angus steak sandwich, with fries and cole-slaw on the side.\" He walked away, came back a couple minutes later with a paper tray over-flowing with dry, tasteless cole slaw, dropped it, spilling a little over the side, onto the table and then walked away. 
I sat there for about ten more minutes when he came back with my fries and sandwich, placed them on the table and began to walk away, I called out, \"excuse me, may i have some silverware?\" He walked away saying nothing and came back with a tiny plastic fork, stuck it in my cole-slaw and again...walked away saying nothing, back to his cell phone.

Now, i'm not one to make a scene, complain, or cause someone to get in trouble in a public place, but Primanti's, your food is over-rated, your server was awful, the floors were filthy, the table I was seated at was sticky and dirty, the atmosphere was not that inviting and worst of all, I paid for it all. But, never again will I visit any Primanti's locations, no way!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I am glad that me and my husband decided to drive a different route home to stop in and try the food."}
{"text":"I tried Primanti Brothers when I was in Pittsburgh for an Eric Clapton concert. Like many tourists, I tried Primanti Brothers because I saw it a thousand times on TV. The particular location I went to is tiny - much smaller than it seemed on TV. Regardless though, the sandwiches are pretty good. 

I sat at the bar and ordered the pastrami sandwich with the provolone, slaw, fries and tomato. The slaw was exactly how I like it; vinegar instead of mayo is the way to go. The fries were pretty good but not amazing. Not sure if they double-fry the fries but they needed to be a bit crispier in my opinion, especially when you consider that they will get automatically soggy on the sandwich. The pastrami had a nice taste but could have tasted more \"homemade\". The Italian bread was a nice touch, but eat quickly or the bread will dissolve into the meat/slaw. 

Two complaints. The sandwiches are not as big as you would think. They are bigger than most deli-style sandwiches but not quite as colossal as I thought it would be. Also, the meal is served on a piece of wax paper... This is probably tradition but I think a plate would better suit. All in all, my experience was good at this tourist-flocking sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I basically come to one of Primanti Bros whenever I come to Pittsburgh to visit family. Some of them are different like I know the one in the strip district only has sandwiches. I decided to finally review this restaurant because I really do like the sandwiches and I would actually rate them a 4 or a 41/2 but this location I just had really bad customer service and will not go back to this one when I am in town.

The sandwich I had was the black angus steak sandwich I got it with a an egg and and onion. The ratio of the slaw, fries, and meat was perfect. The waitress did however manage to dump my food all over the place when she set down and basically just walked away. The wait was also pretty long even though it was a Tuesday afternoon and it wasn't to busy. The other waitress in the building seem to be doing fine we just kind of got stuck with one that didn't want to be there.

Overall the food was good or above average just like any of the the other restaurants I just didn't like the service at this one."}
{"text":"Terrible food and the service was worse. Don't be fooled by their fame and television appearances. The sandwiches are slop and a disgrace to serve. I went here after hearing of the\"legendary\" sandwiches and will never go back. I was even served a skunked Yuengling and was told it was fine when I mentioned it didn't taste right to the server. The server then threw a sandwich on wax paper across the table with bread that fell apart as soon as you touched it. Next time I won't bother and definitely don't recommend."}
{"text":"The place seemed like a tourist trap. The sandwiches with the cole slaw and fries are neat but didn't have much taste. Also, not much meat on the corned beef sandwiches. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Downtown pittsburgh, Pittsburgher cheese steak and corn beef and cheese!! Taste great!! Service was good, 12:20 in the afternoon, servings was one sandwitch tho, stuffed with slaw and fries,.. Still hungry!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwich looked OK when served.. I think the allure of their sandwich is that you eat a whole meal on a sandwich.  Bread, meat, cheese, cole slaw, and fries in one bite! Place seemed pretty chaotic, service not so great, especially for people visiting from out of town and not understanding how the place operates... 

My sandwich was just ok.. I got the roast beef, and my beef was really tough, and the fries a tad bit on the mushy side. The beef was seasoned nicely however, and I personally enjoyed the cole slaw. I was also hoping for a bigger beer selection, which they did not have.. We opted for the local Iron City lager..Which was just OK...

In the end, I'd probably only come back to Primanti Bros. on a late night after drinking and needed greasy hangover food."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, you need to at least have the Primanti Bros. experience. The atmosphere alone is worth it. Situated in Market Square, the restaurant looks out into the square and affords some great people watching. When we got there we got lucky and got seated right away. But we noticed that folks with bigger parties had to wait for a while. The place isn't all that big, so plan ahead if you have a larger party.

I was extremely skeptical at first because I've never had a sandwich like the kind served at Primanti. I ended up ordering the Pitts-burger Sandwich. Between to large pieces of bread, you get your meat of choice, specially-made coleslaw, tomatoes and fries. The combination is actually pretty tasty! The coleslaw gives it flavoring and the bread is thick enough to handle that much sandwich. 

My one knock on this place was the atmosphere. It was VERY loud and due to the chaos our server had a tough time hearing our order (which made it so that the order came out incorrectly) and the tables are VERY close together. But in terms of experiencing some lighthearted atmosphere and good food, this is a great place."}
{"text":"I don't think you could eat here on a regular basis and not have a heart attack within a year.  That said eating here is an experience if you're visiting the area. The place was packed and it's first come first serve seating so you have to keep your eyes open for empty tables. 

All the sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw piled on thick so don't worry about ordering more on the side (or being messy while eating, it's going to be disastrous, so stock up on napkins).

Our table had the Deluxe double egg and cheese and the Pitts-burgher cheese steak sandwiches, both of which were tasty and came out pretty quick considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"It is a MUST for anyone in Pittsburgh. These iconic sandwiches definitely lived up to the hype. Be prepared for a real meal because these sandwiches are HUGE! Definitely lived up to my expectations! Loved the environment of it too. The epitome of the Pittsburgh feel. Perfect place to catch the game and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"So, I have a love for pizza. It's a weakness of mine and I must say their pizza is my absolute favorite. Anytime I go anywhere else for pizza, i find myself comparing and it is usually primantis for the win. A lot  of people don't realize they have it on their menu but I HIGHLY recommend trying it out. Excellent."}
{"text":"I go to this location usually about once a week. First, people, there is other food on their menu other than their famous sandwiches. Chili, salads, pizza and their grilled chicken breast sandwich are all very good. I never have liked their signature sandwiches, so they are not even an issue for me. Great selection of beers both on tap and in bottles. And the general manager has always been had an open ear to beer and wine suggestions. Good guy, and not afraid to pick up an occasional drink.

Service has always been good/very good to both my wife and I. Either at a table or at the bar. They have a pair of twin sisters that work behind the bar who are very good at what they do and are always friendly. We choose to sit at the bar at least half of the time because of them. Considering some of the patrons they have to deal with sometimes, it's remarkable they maintain their consistently good service to their customers at the bar.

The restaurant is almost always very clean, and that includes the bathrooms. Parking is great, although pulling out onto Washington Road is a little tricky when leaving while rush hour traffic is still in affect.

Overall, a four-star place for us. Remember, it's Primant's, not Eleven in the strip. You're in, you're out, and if you get there on the right day of the week, the bartenders are great. What else do you want from a beer and food hangout??????"}
{"text":"I visited primantis to see what all the hype was about. Upon the first bite of my sandwich I was greatest by the taste of at least 1000 fries. I had to open my sandwich up to actually see if there was any meat, I was given 2 disappointing slices of capricola. The sandwich is 77.9% fries 20% coleslaw and 2.1% meat. Like there are just way too many fries. By way too many I mean way to damn many. Like where's the meat primantis? I ordered a capricola and cheese sandwich not a fries and coleslaw sandwich. They should be a fries place not a sandwich place. Even If they were a fries place I would give them 2 stars at best. Good bread though"}
{"text":"It's a pittsburgh MUST - excellent for a midnight run. And it has a ton of good beers on tap. 

Fresh italian bread with whatever meat you want + coleslaw+fries. When I say \"+\" it means they smack it all into your tiny little sandwich. They are extremely generous with the fries so you may want to tell them to put less in."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh tradition! How could fries, coleslaw, and mounds of your choice in meat go wrong? The answer is: it can't.  Bravo Pittsburgh, keep it up."}
{"text":"Holy crap. This sandwich was absolutely DELICIOUS. Came here after the Pirates game on a friends recommendation. I've been savoring another sandwich from them since. Everything was cooked right there, the cook was funny and interacted with us. The server/cashier was a great guy, coming around chatting for a couple or minutes with us. I'd do the drive back to Pittsburgh any day of the week just to eat here again. Luckily they're open 24/7!!!"}
{"text":"i love coming to pittsburgh solely for these sandwiches.  get a different one each time but they are to die for.  my new favorite is the capicola and egg.  i mean anything with fries and coleslaw on it can't be beat.  easily the best cole slaw i've ever had as well."}
{"text":"Love Primanti Bros but this location is terrible. The service is absolutely awful. Waited 15 min after being seated without being served before I left. Not even drinks."}
{"text":"Love the Pittsburgher, I get it with an added egg.  The kraut they put on top is perfectly flavored.  This is a very filling sandwhich! Sometimes I will get a slice of pizza with it.  Yum, I am in the mood for a Pittsburgher now!  I might be hitting this place up later today!"}
{"text":"After my first Primanti experience, here's how I'd sum it up: _just okay_

This place undoubtedly has a cult following (and I respect it), but it's grown to be one of the spots where the hype just compounds one person after another.

I'd rate the sandwiches a solid \"average,\" the service \"pretty poor,\" and price as \"dirt cheap.\""}
{"text":"SO GOOD.

I went to visit a friend (and the Steelers!) a couple times and was introduced to this place. I put french fries whenever I have burgers in SoCal (like In-N-Out)... but, the sandwiches here ALREADY HAVE FRIES IN THEM! Best freakin' idea EVER. The cole slaw in it is good, too. The bread - I don't mind it, but it's just soft, white bread... it gets soggy quickly... might be better toasted. But regardless, it's good stuff! 

The service is alright. It gets packed often, so you can't really expect A+ service. Your food may take a while, it may take a while to even order, but it's definitely worth the wait.

I love the jumbo fish sandwich! Definitely must try to pastrami. Must go again soon to try everything on their menu!

Has been and always will be on my list whenever I'm in Pittsburgh. =)

Go Steelers!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour,  ALL drinks 1/2 off 5-7,  great pizza though they're not known for pizza,  a Pittsburgh legend"}
{"text":"I would say on a weekly basis I consume more sandwiches then any other form of food... so when I found out my girlfriend of years was going to law school in Pittsburgh, I was bummed about the trips I would have to take but I was ecstatic that I would finally get to go experience the famous Primanti Brothers!! Needless to say, I followed the directions of the lady behind the counter and the meal was absolutely disappointing.. I thought the slaw with the fries had no flavor what so ever... I was so upset that the hype behind Primanti's did not live up to it's expectations...

I have tried it a couple of more times but still have had no luck in enjoying a meal from primantis.... 

wish I didn't have to write this"}
{"text":"Primantis is a favorite of mine from growing up. I love visiting and eating sandwiches off of parchent paper and drinking out of papers cups. The simplistic style that Primantis takes is amazing. Never have I had bad or sub par food here. The prices are cheap and you get so much food. The small man street fries and a pittsburgh cheese steak is the perfect comfort food. Service is always good and the drink are better."}
{"text":"Walked in and received a horrible look from the bar tender as she was on her phone. Sat down and waited 15 minutes with no service. Decided to leave and no one cared less."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan, but only barely.  They have lost a lot of their appeal over the last two years.  To much promotion, not enough cooking.  I wish I didn't say this, but Primanti Bros has become to place to go when I can't get a reservation anywhere else.  Geeze guys, get your act together - please!  I used to love *yinz.*"}
{"text":"Fries were kind of bland and the coleslaw was just ok but the meat was very good. Overall, it's a tasty place with good prices"}
{"text":"Yoi! Double Yoi!
This is one legendary sandwich that reeks of classic old school Pittsburgh.
There's a few Primanti Bros around da 'burgh but I've only been to the original...
da one dats dahn da shtrip.
Park in the small lot.  Chances are some dahn-n-out guy will ask you for spare change.
Step inside: Paneled walls like it's some cheapskate's wreck room who refuses to remodel. Two dining rooms of tables, 1st one has a counter you can sit at and watch your sammich get assembled. Choose your meat: steak, corned beef, pastrami, etc... I've only ever gotten the pastrami.  Why change a good thing? Which actually is the philosophy behind the entire establishment.
The sandwich: two slices of big soft i-talian bread, meat, cheese, slaw, fries, tomato, onions... that's right, cole slaw and french fries IN the sammich... the parts as individual food stuffs might not be incredibly amazing... but they way they put it all together, the Primanti way, adds up to a magical sum that is much greater than its individual parts. The softness of the bread wraps itself around the ingredients into one scrumptious mess. Try to open wide and bite into that! Delicious!
Borrowing the words of the legendary late great Steelers sportscaster Myron Cope, 
\"Yoi! Double Yoi!\" 
That's one fine tasty sammich."}
{"text":"it lived up to the hype! The Angus steak sandwich with cheese was phenomenal! I loved the sandwich with the fries and slaw in top ... Great stuff! Next time I am in Pittsburgh  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Primanti Brothers. I have been to many different locations and I really love them all. The slaw and fries on the sandwich is really what makes the whole thing. If in Pittsburgh you must get sandwich here."}
{"text":"Decent food, interesting atmosphere, if your by one stop in but don't go out of your way to seek one out!!!!"}
{"text":"Man vs food. 
What more can we say.  Great sandwiches.  Good beer selection and friendly weight staff.   A Pittsburgh staple. As seen on tv"}
{"text":"Came out here for a weekend and had the Pitts-Burger and split with the pastrami sandwich. Both sandwiches were awesome but I must say that the pastrami had more flavor. The chili was also great with a nice kick and very flavorful. Food and service was great!"}
{"text":"Primanti brothers is a \"gotta go\" type place. They don't give great food, they put fries in the sandwich and don't really balance it with the meat or cheese. But it is iconic and has a unique charm to it. Nice servers, fast service, and reasonable prices give it a lot of positive reviews as well. 

If you're expecting a culinary masterpiece go elsewhere. It's more of a novelty with a pretty good taste and incredibly fresh bread."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch. The onion rings were greasy. We jad the sirloin and cheese sandwich.  The bread was ok. The fries were a bit greasy but were not seasoned. The coleslaw was good and would be better on the sandwich without the french fries.  It is not somewhere I will be excited to go back to."}
{"text":"Go hungry !
These sandwiches are a gastric bomb.

Very tasty \" Pittsburgh style\" sandwiches ... Which is to say slaw and fries on it.

I had the Pitts burger which was good but not great. Without the toppings it would've been bland. I opened it up and added a dash of salt and pepper which made it better. My daughters got the corned beef and cheese and vegetable soup both of which were OUTSTANDING. Maybe the best soup I've ordered out.

This location is the original so it's more authentic. It's a nightmare to find ... My GPS was having a seizure... But they have a parking lot.

Walking to the bathroom is kind of like entering the Batcave. Steep old stairs but the place was clean and had character"}
{"text":"My bf is a Pittsburgh native.  I remember the first time we had Primanti's from Lucky's in Chicago.  I served everyone their Primanti's in my living room, dodging the Terrible Towels as the Steeler's game pushed on... and I stared at mine, wondering how the heck people can possibly eat this heaping, gross, mass of meat, slaw and fries.  I took mine apart and made a nice little buffet across 2 plates and ate it that way.  

THEN I took my first trip to Pittsburgh, took a chance on the real deal... and boy oh boy did I become a Primanti's lover!  Everytime we go to Pittsburgh, we hit Primanti's for lunch.  We have to!!  I never want to start a trip to Pgh out without hitting Primanti's... pronto!  =)  

Primanti's is a great little spot to grab lunch, dinner, and even a mid-day snack.  I love the fact that this place is always jammed full of people.  Their food is well worth the wait and the effort it takes to tackle a table before someone else does.  The murals on the wall never get old, and it's great for one person or the whole family.  I can't wait to go next week for the start of my holiday season!"}
{"text":"Well, now I know why people don't usually put french fries in their sandwiches. Sandwich comes out huge and kind of dry, and you can't taste the meat at all."}
{"text":"My favorite out of all the Primantis.  There is never a long wait.  Food is delicious and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Great sandwich one of the best I've ever had we came on a busy night and out food came out kind of slow but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time. Was told to check out this place. Ate at the original, sat at the counter and ordered the pitt-burger. Great food and cool location."}
{"text":"I don't get to go to Pittsburgh often, but when I do, I always stop at a Primanti's location for lunch or dinner.  This is not an option, it's a must-do for anyone visiting the 'Burgh.  This time, I stopped at the Steubenville Pike location, since it was on the way back to the hotel where I was staying that night.  

There's a seating area, plus a bar where once can also enjoy a cold beer and a good meal.  Service was exceptionally fast, got my Iron City beer and a Pittsburgher cheese-steak sandwich in almost no time.  This is apparently one of their top selling sandwiches, and of course comes with the standard sourdough bread, cheese, fries and coleslaw right in the sandwich.  This is a treat, and I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros is basically the heart of all yinzers in Pittsburgh. However, I have to take primanti bros in doses. Their big ass sandwiches make me feel like I dont need to eat the rest of the week. Sometimes I love it for that and sometimes I hate it. Either way its a nice place to sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice cold beer with my friends. 

 My only complaint about this particular primanti bros in market square is the people that it generates. Anywhere from hookers to crackheads. I have been in there several times and atleast 4 or 5 times I watched someone get kicked out for doing something illegal. My advice is, if you can, go to this primantis during the day for lunch dont go at night. If you can go to the one in the strip district or southside on 17th street."}
{"text":"Before we started the second leg of our road trip to Pittsburgh, I asked my wife to punch in the address for Primanti's Bros. After watching the gross antics of 'man eats world', I wanted to inaugurate the weekend by joining others in this pilgrimage. 

If you miss the craziness on Penn Ave, don't worry. The line during lunch time will bring you back to the hustle of \"the strip.\" The place has two main sitting areas, one with a bar and one with a counter to witness the birth of a sandwich. Its reminiscent of your childhood when you stuffed potato chips into a sandwich that your mom made but instead with slaw and fries...genius! Who needs plates? Just parchment paper and your hands is all that's required. Good food, fast service, and only cash people. Overall I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars.

What we ordered:
- corned beef and cheese
- pastrami and cheese

When did we go:
- Saturday @ noon

Will we come back?
Definitely! My wife wants me to bring some back in a cooler. :D"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend getting extra meat ... its already a million calories so why not add on a couple more. Seriously though otherwise all the other ingredients take over the sandwich and you find yourself hunting for meat. The one down town has way atmosphere. BUT it  was good, and if you are in the Pitt you gotta go!"}
{"text":"Hey a sandwich with the fries and slaw inside served on a wax paper sheet and tasty (maybe a little bland, may have not chosen the best type) but would go back in a second."}
{"text":"I guess you do have to head here if you're making a trip to Pittsburgh-I felt obligated after everything I'd read, at least. They offer reasonably priced, fairly overstuffed sandwiches, but I can't say that putting fries and cole slaw in a sandwich amounts to a culinary breakthrough. I had the Pastrami and I was probably happiest at my table (my dining companions ordered the fried fish and roast beef)."}
{"text":"A theoretically touristic place where they don't accept international passport to sell you alcohol. Worst treat from the waiter. With no reclamation book. When we tried to call the general manager, he was \"busy\". I would give them 0 stars."}
{"text":"P-bros never gets old! My favorite is the jumbo bologna and cheese....had it since a kid! Great spot for late night or anytime really. Just go at a time when theyre not as busy (weekdays, off hours on weekend).
Pittsburgh classic for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm not a coleslaw eating girl. Never have been, HOWEVER...I'd eat the coleslaw on a Primanti Bros sandwich everyday if I could. This place is that good. We had the Kielbasa and the corned beef. Excellent! The price is very reasonable for what you you are getting as well. Be ready for a nap!! Truly a must when in Pittsburgh which I must say is quite picturesque. I will definitely be back to this city!!"}
{"text":"This is the place you must take out of town visitors! It's so Pittsburgh. The sandwiches are AMAZING! OMG. This location is the original one and my favorite of them all. It started out as a truck stop and is still open 24hrs a day. A great option for a post club dinner. 
This place is fast paced and all business. You are expected to know what you want. The workers talk like Pittsburghers when they're not speaking Italian and sassing each other. The walls are painted with all the famous Pittsburghers from over the decades - Andrew Carnegie to Franco Harris.

FYI - the sandwiches are huge. Cash only."}
{"text":"My first time at Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh, PA.  I was not impressed with my sandwich there.  I've only been once so maybe I ordered the wrong thing but it just wasn't blowing my skirt up.

I ordered the corned beef sandwich with the fries and slaw and it tasted a little bland to me.  It needed some sauce.  I think with some mustard this might have been great.  It was dry.  I did enjoy the cole slaw.

The service was fast and the server we had was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing Primanti Brothers featured on Man v. Food.

  Er, yeah...is this the best diner food Pittsburgh has to offer?
 
  The sandwiches were totally bland, and although tall, not very big. They weren't particularly appetizing. I opted to not finish mine even though I definitely could have if I had wanted to. The bread was sort of cheap. Flavorless fries, and I'm pretty sure the only condiment I found was ketchup, or possibly hot sauce. I don't remember which overstuffed sandwich I ordered. I only remember the bitter taste of disappointment. I don't think it was all that cheap for what you get, either.

   Primanti Brothers may have invented the overstuffed sandwich, but it seems like they have been resting on their laurels ever since...I don't know...the Industrial Revolution? (or whenever they first came up with the idea). The Panini's franchise in Cleveland, Ohio does overstuffed sandwiches better, and I'm not saying this because of some dumb, imaginary football rivalry, either.

   What was really poor was the atmosphere of Primanti Brothers. The place is located by the river. Outside of Primanti Bros, there was this overpowering rotting fish smell. It was either rotting fish or loading dock garbage, but it smelled rather bad. The ladies room was terrifying. It was down a steep flight of stairs into this dank, dark concrete basement. I saw a cockroach in the ladies room, which was what I imagined a prison bathroom would look like. I'm not even sure if they have wheelchair accessible restrooms here (you might want to check before you make the trek). 

  My overall experience with Primanti Brothers was that its reputation as a good sandwich place is mostly hype."}
{"text":"My first prim bros experience was at this location fresh baked Cibrones bread with HotSausage Prov fries and slaw good lord Prim Bros is a staple in Pittsburgh and if you can't make it to the Original in the Strip coming here will not disappoint! The staff to me could have done a better job because at first I was confused and no one seemed to be egar to help but other then that great must go!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the food was Primanti's. 

Saw a few post along the line \"this was a staple of Pittsburgh\" but not impressed. 

The originals are downtown and require the time and travel for the original experience. 

These chains have done a great job maintaining the food quality of the original but at a much more traditional restaurant atmosphere. 

Food was fast and good. My waitress was pleasant and quick to serve checking regularly."}
{"text":"A staple for any night. 

Ventured from my standard Pitts-burger and tried the Hot Sausage. Wasn't disappointed but nothing compares to the #2 Best Seller. 

Almost had the place to ourselves on a Tuesday night so service was good and food came out quick like all their locations."}
{"text":"One of those Pittsburgh staples that you should try at least once. The sandwiches are good, especially love the capicola ham. However, there are so many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, it's hard to justify eating here too often."}
{"text":"Awesome place, it's kind of small but the cheesesteak with the fries and slaw on it was just awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Good Service, friendly staff, disgusting sandwich. I had a cheesesteak and it was collossal filled with dry shredded cabbage and flat squishy greasy french fries (?!). I heard they were \"Pittsburgh's Best!\" so I continued to eat giving this thing in front of me the benefit of doubt..well it sucked till I was finished. I ended up throwing most of it away. I guess if I was drunk and it was 3 am I would have enjoyed this disconnected greasy pile of dried cole slaw cabbage stuff and fat fries with the other crap but it was lunch. I wasnt expectinG THAT."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the food and atmosphere.  I wish I had purchased my grinder elsewhere."}
{"text":"Place sucks. Loser rude servers ignore you even if you stand at a register and wait- you will get ignored. This place is going down. Server said\"you don't matter - I have a million people to take care of\"
  This was after waiting 20+ minutes at the register with cash in hand. I understand it's busy- but acknowledge people - appreciate customers! When you tell us to F off- you ar going DOWN! Rude! Not worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend grew up in Pittsburgh and always raves about Primanti Bros. So, of course, every time we visit it is one of our go-to places. 

I had high expectations going there and I was not disappointed. The food is delicious! Each time we've gone I've gotten The \"Pitts-Burger Cheese Steak\". I really wanted one of the salads the first time I went, but I was quickly told that you \"can't go to Primantis and get a salad! You HAVE to get a sandwich\". Well, I'm glad I listened, because the sandwich ROCKED! 

This location is the only one I've ever been to, but I love it! It's very spacious, clean, and the staff is great! 

Mmmm now I want a sandwich with coleslaw and fries on it!"}
{"text":"Does it live up to the hype? Not quite.

Is it worth going at least once? Absolutely.

The problem is it's just a big ol' soggy pile of average quality food. Sorry for the crazy long sentence. For historic reasons, you need to try Primanti Brothers. For a great meal, try about 200 better restaurants in The Burgh."}
{"text":"My first time at Primanti's and I was not disappointed. I ordered the turkey and cheese and of course I could not finish it all. It was delicious though. They have their own coleslaw which has a sweet flavor to it...it's a little strange, but good! Their menu is reasonably priced; cheap if you ask me considering how big the dang sandwiches are! My husband had the Angus steak...double meat. He was thrilled. They even have personal pizzas at this one. It was a great experience. Will always stop at Primanti's when we're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively \"famous\" for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless, a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy, dirty and probably not even up to code."}
{"text":"+ unique sandwiches

If you ever want to experience a sandwich that already includes the fries in the bun you shouldn't miss Primanti. 
Though now a large local chain it originated from the shop in historic Strip District. 
They have a large variety of different ingredients and the portions enormous, so think of sharing a sandwich.
Moreover Primanti is a nice choice for travelers on a budget.

+ unique and super yummy sandwiches
+ inexpensive

Average price for a sandwich: $8"}
{"text":"A solid, classic 'Burgh staple. If you don't try it you'll never know what your missing. Roast beef and a fry boat...good times. Wish I was there often but distance makes that impossible."}
{"text":"Always a 'Burgh mainstay when I am in town. What else do I need to say? If you haven't been you won't understand. Just check it out."}
{"text":"Everyone who has been to Pittsburgh told me to check Primanti Brother out. I was hesitant because I like to separate all of my food, not mix it up. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. It comes with cheese, fries & their slaw all mixed into the sandwich. Once I tasted it I was truly surprised. It was a really good sandwich. Everyone should try eating here. There are several locations all over the city."}
{"text":"Primanti bros has the best corned beef sandwich in the east, and the coleslaw, fries and tomato right on the sandwich made it totally unique. Oh and they also have a great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"The meat on the sandwiches are a bit strange, kind of like a meatloaf or spam slice, something I wasn't used to. I am also not a huge fan of coleslaw so it didn't help that all the sandwiches were covered with it.

Beware of greasy floors! The instant you walk in, you'll feel yourself slipping a little. Overall, the atmosphere was nice but I feel like the food just didn't live up to it's name."}
{"text":"I guess it's a local thing.  Since I was not sure what I was walking into, I kind of went with it.  The corned beef was tender, but a few slices less and it would have been MIA, the  slaw was tasty, the french fries on the sandwich with the bread kind of threw me.  But heck what do I know.  Once I figured out how to navigate the sandwich... it was just okay.  But once is enough!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Meat, cheese, egg, fries, slaw, tomato all in fresh bead. An experience!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time, first time was at a primanti in coriopolis, that was not a sandwich.  This is the true primanti sandwich!"}
{"text":"My sandwich-When Pigs Fly- was amazing and huge. My son's wings were very good as well. The white pizza was exceptionally greasy and the gyro's sauce was probably out of a jar. 
Stick with the sandwiches. They are amazing."}
{"text":"Good quality is good. It's a unique experience for sure. I highly recommend it. 

Tonight while eating sat right next to a Steelers player. So yes it is a great hang out. 

When going seat yourself. Order some great grub and enjoy yourself. This is a Pittsburgh must."}
{"text":"Overrated! We were in Pittsburgh for the football game on Sunday. We got off the plane, checked into the hotel, and headed straight to Primanti Bros. We had heard it was a \"must do\" when visiting Pittsburgh. Although I think everyone should try it once - I don't think there is a second try in the cards for me. We all were putting ketchup and hot sause on our cheese steak sandwhiches just to give them flavor. Although it is a novel idea to put the fries, coleslaw, and cheesesteak all together, I couldn't enjoy the flavor of the cheesesteak with all the other stuff on the sandwich.  The chicken nachos at Heinz Stadium were much better :-)"}
{"text":"Came here due to Yelp reviews and the Travel Network.  

Very cramped and not too friendly, but the food makes up for it.  Huge portions of yummy meats, topped with coleslaw and fries on great italian bread.     Very basic menu, but all your typical subs are her."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, family friendly, sports TV, great prices. Start off with the batter fried spicy pickles."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing place. The food was awful and service was absolutely the worst I've experienced."}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh stop!  Whenever we return to Pittsburgh we make time for this iconic sandwich."}
{"text":"A truly unique experience

My wife discovered this place and it was recommended by so many of our friends that we had to try it. 

Both of us ordered the fish sandwich and the idea of the additional cole slaw and tomato with french fries all in one was a bit much to handle for me. But it was no contest for my better half.

Great crunch, good finish, the cheese gave it a nice flavour and I would definitely do it again.

My only disappointment is that I found the fries to be about half cooked and I wish they fried 'em longer.

Completely unique, great service at the restaurant as well.

If you are in Pittsburgh, do not miss this."}
{"text":"You'll have to forgive me. I live in Los Angeles where there is valet parking for hamburgers and top chefs have food trucks that can be found here, there and everywhere. A burger with a side of fries smothered in Duck Confit with White Truffle Sauce - so perhaps the bar is a tad higher than here in - ack - Pittsburgh where I found myself searching for sustenance before attending the wedding that brought me here. I only hope the godawful mess I actually ate doesn't rear it's ugly head mid-ceremony.

It sounded like such a novel concept, a sandwich with all the sides just piled on. After all, it's all going to the same place, right? Having been born and raised in Chicago it was a familiar concept. The noble Chicago Dog, a study in contradictions: sweet and sour, spicy and mild, hot and cold - a veritable melange that blends and tantalizes from the first bite to the last. Yes! I'll try it!

With my omnivore brother and his lovely wife I made my way through the chilly streets of downtown Pittsburgh on this frosty Saturday. A bustling little metropolis, scant parking so (I am shamed to admit) I pulled in a nearby lot that charged an $8 flt fee. A small price to pay, I reasoned, for a gastronomic delight as has been described here. Yes, as I said, I'm from out of town.

On to the main event - my bro and his bride went with the signature piece, the pastrami sandwich. I opted for the Hot Sausage with cheese. May god have mercy on my gastrointestinal tract.

It is a wonder how a sandwich with so many things can be so uniformly bland. Perhaps it starts with the niggardly portions of actual meat - when confronted with this sandwich in profile it is hard to find under the wad of soggy fries and tasteless cole slaw. The liquid in the slaw makes the bread begin to disintegrate almost immediately so that should you be as foolhardy as I and actually attempt to eat this mess it will be all over the table in short order.

I ate it - I admit that. I'm not proud of it, but I was that hungry. The saving grace of the near-complete lack of any discernable seasoning is that I don't have an aftertaste to suffer through, but the leaden ball in the pit of my stomach promises to make up for that with a trip or two to the bathroom in the hopefully not too distant future.

I would eat at McDonalds before I went back here. Please - don't fall for the raves here. It's pure, unadulterated crap."}
{"text":"Okay, traveled from NC and was told that Primanti Brothers was a must do. Six of us went and all of us decided to split  3 sandwiches. The quantity was excellent but the sandwich was more of a gimmick than a unique eating experience. Service was rushed with no personal connection. We all agreed that the sandwich would have been better with slaw and fries served separate. We can at least say that we have been there, done that, don't need to go back."}
{"text":"Came here twice on my visit to Pittsburgh. Once During the day, once after a few drinks. Both times I was extremely hungry, and both times Primanti Bros. satisfied. Sandwiches run between 5-8 dollars, which is extremely cheap for the size of these bad boys. What makes their sandwiches unique is that they top each sandwich with slaw and french fries. The first sandwich I got was the pastrami, which was loaded with it and pretty good. The second sandwich I had was the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak, which was just okay. The problem I had with the sandwiches was that the fries kind of overpowered the rest of the sandwich, and they weren't very good. Overall, it's a decent place, and extremely cheap, but if you're looking for a great sandwich, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This location has horrible food!  We ordered the Phittsburgher and the Black Angus sandwiches and the meat in both was dry and overcooked.  Neither sandwich had any cheese on it.  Our bread was doughy and soggy.  The fries on the Pittsburgher were supposed to be on the side but they piled on extra fries and almost no meat.  The only good items at this location are their appetizers.  We've been to a location in Moon Twp and it was delicious but this location was a complete letdown!  If you're in town visiting, avoid this location and find a Primanti Bro's. outside of downtown and you'll be much happier and likely to return!"}
{"text":"The Colossal Fish was decent sandwich.  not sure if i like a mound of fries in it though.  fish and bread were decent enough.  the Pitts Burgers Cheese Steak was really good.

cool place to watch a game or kick back with some friends."}
{"text":"I come to Pittsburgh on business regularly, and look forward to coming here. Great food, friendly staff. Love the happy hour."}
{"text":"The next best thing to the original primanti brothers in the Strip District. Our servers are always friendly and our food is cooked to perfection. Great branch of Primanti's!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Not food network worthy.  I would be critical of the cleanliness of the restaurant at market square, but I enjoyed the food enough to ignore it."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places.   I get a roast beef with all the toppings and am never disappointed.  While this place is located in Harmarville (severe lack of character) this place really manages to capture some of the vibe of the original.

good food, friendly staff, great memories"}
{"text":"landed in Pittsburgh and the first food we sought out was Primanti Bros.  maybe I was over hyped but I really didn't think this sandwich was all that.  yes, it's freakin' huge.  yes, it has fries and coleslaw in it...all things I give props to.  I went with pastrami and also threw in a fried egg for the full experience ($7).  

I really wanted this sandwich to blow me away and it just didn't.  maybe it was because the bread was just sliced bread.  it wasn't grilled w/butter w/little bit of seasoning.  maybe it was that the coleslaw was a bit bland and not wet enough.  one thing that really killed the experience for me was that the fried egg was totally over cooked.  I was so ready for that drippy egg yolk experience and they denied me of it! 

service was great...we were in there @ 4pm and it seemed like we missed the lunch crowd.  the prices are great.  bottom line:  this is late night after the bars food and maybe we needed a sweet buzz on to really appreciate the sandwich.  I'll make sure I down a 12er before my next visit."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Primanti's this past weekend on the recommendation of a co worker. To say we were disappointed is an understatement.

We ordered the Pastrami & cheese, Bacon & cheese, & Pitts-burger w/ cheese. Our orders arrived wrapped in paper which we all thought was cool. Unfortunately, none of orders had cheese on them like we had ordered. The sandwiches were piled high with cole slaw and some fries, but on the bottom of the sandwiches were exactly 2 slices of meat (pastrami & bacon) and tiny patty (Pitts-burger).

Being from Brooklyn, NY and used to having MEAT on our sandwiches, we were very disappointed. 

I will say, the cole slaw was very good. The tall mug of Bud Lite draught was very good."}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders early on Friday night. Great food deals for under $5 if you stick w the fry combos and under $9 for the sandwiches. Tasty for sure, try it!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, probably won't go back.
Really bad service. Server brought our drinks, came back 10 minutes later for food order. Food took over 40 minutes, pretty slow. Never saw server again until he dropped off the bill.
Food was okay, not worth that kind of wait and that bad of service. 
Used to go to the strip location many years ago, 3 am with lines out the door, food came out in 10 minutes.
Not the same since they sold. Big food chain owners need to get their act together."}
{"text":"It's obligatory if you've never been to Pittsburgh before as it's a staple. The place won't wow you with it's ambiance by any stretch of the imagination but it has a feel. Sandwiches are classic just make sure you have an alka seltzer handy."}
{"text":"I was born & raised in Pittsburgh & when I finally was able to move away 23 years later I never once looked back or felt the tiniest twinge of regret.

BUT...

...there is one thing I very much truly miss, and that is a hot sausage sandwich from Primanti's.  My boyfriend happily left Pittsburgh to join me in Philadelphia as well, but Primanti's is the one Pittsburgh topic that is continually brought up between us when is comes to fond memories of the Steel City.
A huge freakin' sandwich with french fries and cole slaw.  I know, I know...I thought it was disgusting at first too, but it is truly some amazing sandwich. 

Oh, what I would give for a Primanti's to pop up in Philadelphia.  C'mon, anyone from Primanti's reading this?  I think you guys would be a huge success on South Street or in Old City!  *wink wink*  Give us a try!  ;)

I would have given 5 stars, but while I was in visiting over Thanksgiving I treated myself to my hot sausage fave, and it was sadly not as good as I remembered it (but still pretty damn fantastic!)"}
{"text":"I visited for the first time with my husband and we had high hopes.  And by the way my husband will eat anything.  Neither of us liked at all what we received which was the
Pittsburgher cheese steak.  The meat portion was smallish and tasted like a nasty hamburger that was cooked on top of the stove and also flavorless.  The cole slaw was straight out of the can.  Nonexistent cheese.  Limp tasteless fries.  It was so bad that I had to have another meal elsewhere to eleviate that denied feeling.  And I am not a big person but could def. handle more food after this horrible meal.  What is all the hype?  Whoever gives this place 4-5 stars must have eaten there late at night while drunk and were still drunk writing the review.  I write this review and yes, I am born and bred Pittsburgher.  There are sooo many other good places to eat here both expensive and inexpensive."}
{"text":"The following review is based on an actual conversation (if by \"actual\" you mean \"embellished for literary panache\").

\"Primanti's is the best! It's a Pittsburgh institution!\"

\"It's terrible.  The sandwiches are over-rated.  It's a novelty act!\"

\"Screw you!\"

\"Bite me!\"

\"I can't believe I married you!\"

\"I can't believe I ever asked you to marry me!!\"

This type of argument seems to abound on Yelp.  So just try Primanti's and decide for yourself.  I do agree that the cheesesteak isn't that great, but I would highly recommend the capicola.  The spiciness of that meat works well with the coleslaw."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. This place is really bad. The service is insanely sliw and unhelpful,  the atmosphere is pure bad-sports bar, and the food is all weirdly mushy and flavorless. It may be a tradition, but Pittsburgh has much better things to offer.  At least the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"OMG - TERRIBLE - unless you like (literally) FRIES FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE on your sandwiches.  We're native 'Burghers and have been going to Primanti's (the original Strip location) since 1979 and on our way through Moon, we took our two boys to this location to enjoy a taste of the Burgh.  Well.. after the first bite, we knew immediately they had saved their French Fries from the night before and used them on us (we were there at 11:15 am - just after they opened on December 27th).  How did we know????  The fries were cold - they tasted stale - like day old fry oil - they were HOLLOW INSIDE - HOLLOW!!  Terrible - just terrible.  You want to save your cole slaw in the fridge, okay - keep the lunch meat - for sure - bread saved for the next day (okay, if stored properly) - BUT GIVE ME A BREAK - SAVING FRIES!?!?  Horrible.  Pass this dump by and do yourself a favor - go to the Strip District location - been going there for almost 40 years and never had a bad experience.  As for this place - they should have to eat their own OLD FRIES for the rest of their lives....."}
{"text":"When my Dad and I were driving down the street looking for a place to go. My He suddenly pulled into this place and said he's been here before. I asked him what kind of food they had, and he said that they have THE BEST sandwich I would ever taste. So we sat down at our table my Dad got some Buffalo wings, and I got the original sandwich. It wasn't necessary the best I've ever tasted it was ok though. My dad offered me a wing and I had it. Wasn't to good. The service wasn't ether."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time/$$. Everyone said we had to try it while in Pittsburgh & the original was the best. Burger/sandwich wasn't that good. Coleslaw was dry & bread wasn't toasted. It was just a mess of unimpressive cheap food."}
{"text":"No. Just..no.  Decided to go on a lunch adventure during a road trip from Detroit to DC.  My niece found this spot that had been highly rated on the food network, so why not? Well, turns out the fare is HIGHLY overrated.  Service was good, but I was disgusted by the Pitts-burger.  What the hell is that mystery meat? It tasted like cheap, spongy Salisbury steak.  The fries were nothing special, the Cole slaw was drab, and the bread was nothing to write home about. 

I ate half of the sandwich and left highly disappointed. The #1 ordered sandwich?Pittsburgh deserves to be represented better than this.  Gotta wonder how much they paid for their reviews."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because family members like it, but honestly I wish that it would lose the idea of being Pittsburgh's place to eat. It gives a very bad impression, as all three locations I've been to were very dirty. Not to mention the sandwiches are the only ones I've had (or any kind of food) that I could seriously feel the grease sitting in my stomach."}
{"text":"I do not eat cole slaw but it is really the element that makes these sandwiches.  They aren't full of a lot of flavor but the combined ingredients are tasty."}
{"text":"I just want to thank the team at Primanti Bros. for hosting my twins 4th birthday lunch.  They were professional and reasonable from start to finish.

First, they were very responsive to emails about reserving space for about 25 people.  Management helped me negotiate any dilemmas, including calling ahead a partial order so some food was ready for the kids close to our arrival.

Also, they allowed me to drop off a large Costco birthday cake the day before and hold it in their fridge for nearly 24 hours.

When we arrived, they had set things up in a back room to be \"party ready\" with a special table for the appetizers, and later, a special table for the cake.

The two waiters who worked with us were very attentive and rolled very well with the chaos that can come from a 4-year-old birthday party!

Finally, the whole experience was VERY affordable.  Let's just say I have spent almost as much taking my girlfriend out to The Cheesecake Factory as I did making 25 people happy here.

While the food here (and generally all Primanti Bros.) is always a solid 3-4 stars, the experience they provided my family and our guests hit 5 starts yesterday.

If you are looking for a good place for a kids' birthday party, I suggest here!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. Great vibe with fantastic food and even better service! Terror Tots are a must if you're up for the heat"}
{"text":"Polite service, nice ambience, great local crowd, but the food is kinda disappointing. Still a good place to guzzle beer and zone out to tv"}
{"text":"I head to Primanti Brothers whenever I'm in town.  I also use it as an opportunity to feed friends and introduce them to a place that is uniquely the Burgh.  I'm originally from Erie, but have many wonderful memories involving PB, mostly from my early college years.

Most recently was here with two Pittsburgh natives and my boyfriend in November 2011.  No wait to be seated, but the dining area was extremely busy.  It was a Friday afternoon and a mixed, lively crowd.  The food was just as expected - a filling, overflowing sandwich pile that paired perfectly with a Yuengling.  I had the corned beef and cheese, btw.

The bread is cheap.  It gets soggy and if you are not a quick eater, the sandwich will fall apart.  Native Pennsylvanians eat like cavemen anyway, so it's generally not a problem.  Factor in a VERY low-key atmosphere, a very Eastern-European waitress, and a whole crowd just happy to be around one another and you should have a great time.  I almost prefer to visit during busy periods because this has always been my experience.

Boyfriend was genuinely charmed by the place.  He eats too quickly to form any worthwhile opinion on the quality of his dish, but he did enjoy dismissing all the rules of his traditional, well-mannered Southern upbringing.  He got to play with his food.  He could stare at the funny, bumbling half-drunks traipsing throughout the place.  

And now, he wants to put french fries on every sandwich he makes.  Thank you, Primanti Brothers."}
{"text":"I waited over an hour for my two slices of pizza to come out, and they were room temperature when they arrived. I watched at least 15 other people seated after me order, receive their food, eat and the pay their tab and leave. I was told the manager was on their way out and they never showed up. I'm definitely never coming to this Primantis again, and possibly never going to another at all."}
{"text":"you have to be drunk to like this dirty,stickey floor,wobbly tables,place"}
{"text":"Frankly, I don't get the hype. This is my second time here, attempting to give it another shot, but I guess the sandwiches are just consistently disappointing. I ordered a roast beef, which ended up being just a really tall french fry and cole slaw sandwich. A single thin slice of roast beef. And isn't there supposed to be a tomato on there? Sorry Primanti Bros, I give up."}
{"text":"A notch below great. However because of its origins in Pittsburgh it's a good idea to stop by for a sandwich if you're in the city. The Pitts- burger is definitely the go to especially because it is the #2 best seller."}
{"text":"If you don't come to Primantis at least once in your life, then you've never really enjoyed true northern feel good food have you ?, no , no you have not. Shame on you ! I can't even look at you anymore."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I usually hit this spot late night on a weekend. Staff are friendly, service is quick. Food is very good."}
{"text":"We had to go here due to the reputation and many recommendations from yinz.  

Food was good and reasonably priced but flavor was interesting.  The sandwiches are all served with slaw and French fries on them.  Sounds like a great idea but I felt the fries really dampened the taste of the other sandwich ingredients.  We got the pastrami and cheese as well as the corned beef and cheese and the would have been more flavorful without the fries.  But then again, one of the main attractions of this place is fried on the sandwich - so it's all what you prefer,  

The atmosphere is good, food comes out super fast and even if you have to wait for a table the turn over is fast.  

Worth a stop if you are touring Pittsburgh for the day!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We especially loved the soft bread on the sandwiches. Everything has large portions too. I can't wait to go back and try different things there. Everything on the menu looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Crazy theory for a sandwich..Cole slaw & French Fries stacked on the sandwich?!? I figured why not... It was Awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was good..  Service was ok..  Seen better.."}
{"text":"Greasy, greasy, greasy. Worse is all the sandwiches are bland. Then there is the horrible liquid processed cheese-like product. Yes, a novelty is the fries slapped into the sandwich. But when the novelty wears off, it is nothing but food that is tasteless and unforgettable, not a place to return to enjoy any sandwich."}
{"text":"Came to Pittsburgh for the first time with a friend and I wanted to try something that you could only get in Pittsburgh. My friend reccomended this place to me and said to go to the orginal one in the Strip District, as there were other ones around. For my first meal in Pittsburgh I wasn't dissapointed. 

As we came in, a waitress told us to just sit wherever we'd like. Service came to us quickly and was very helpful.  Although she wasn't as friendly, she seemed to know her stuff. However, the place was busy so she probably was very busy herself. The food came out to us in less than 5 minutes. I got the roast beef and cheese sandwich with onions and my friend got the Pitt-burger. We also got an extra side of fries. Everything was great!  The fries were perfectly cooked and the sandwich was giant and delicious. 

The only things that I would complain about would be server friendliness and the lack of host stand. Other than that I would definitely reccomend this for anybody who wants to get something unique to Pittsburgh and wants to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great sandwhich for $6. It's divey, the bathroom feels like you are going to get raped in it but its a Pittsburgh tradition. 

If you want to try something from Pittsburgh eat here. It's open 24 hours a day and especially crowded if there is a football game as most tourists come here.  

The sandwich is great but then again it's a sandwich like any famous sandwich it gets over hyped. Is it great, yes... Will it change your life, no. Though everyone thinks the cheesesteak is the most Pittsburgh thing there it's not. Capicolla or Genoa are probably the two I see people from here get the most"}
{"text":"Female night bartender is incredibly rude and acts like it physically hurts her to wait on you and barely speaks. Not the customer service I'm looking for while having a casual beer. Also, the staff is not so sneaky about taking shots while ON the clock together."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. The sandwiches are delicious. Great bread, huge sizes, super messy. And they have Dogfishhead 60 minute IPA on tap."}
{"text":"Ordered a double meat pastrami sandwich. All of the sandwiches are served Pittsburgh style-- with coleslaw, tomato and fries on Italian bread. The coleslaw makes the whole sandwich a little soggy (some other people complain about this, but it didn't bother me). The sandwich was HUGE and well worth what you pay for it (half the price it would be in NY, etc). 

This  location is nice, right along a highway with lots of trees and a nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, a Pittsburgh original. Went with my wife & two kids on a Saturday afternoon. Was a first time for my kids 5 & 1, both loved it!! All was very good! We will be back"}
{"text":"Wish we had this sort of place in Asheville. Great sandwiches that I ate multiple times during my stay."}
{"text":"A lot of cities have their \"signature item\" food wise. Many times they leave you disappointed, wondering \"what the big deal is\". 
We came here years and years ago on our first pilgrimage to Pittsburgh (we're HUGE Steelers fans), and this was our first stop. All I can say is, it's still our first stop every single time we go down, and I don't see that ever changing. The Pittsburger, the kielbasa, the capicola, even the fish, every sandwich I've tried is an out of the park home freaking run. There is no coleslaw like this anywhere else, period. And there is no other sandwich to compare to the king. Long live the king, long live Primanti's!"}
{"text":"Love Primanti's ! I was waiting for one in the south hills. Nice decor and always good food. If there is one drawback it is pulling out of the parking lot during rush hour. It is at a very busy intersection."}
{"text":"The first time I was in Pittsburgh, I just had to go to Primanti Brothers to see what all the hype was about. A sandwich about the size of my head appeared, and the reputation I've heard of this place all along had me expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread. 

Well, it was ok. Putting more stuff between bread shouldn't really qualify a \"famous sandwich\". The meat was questionable and the slaw just didn't make it past one bite. 

***********
I thought, maybe my expectations got the better of me. So, I gave it another shot a year later. I ordered the fish sandwich. The fish was lost in the fried batter. :( Again, with the slaw. Geez. The fries in the sandwich was a creative touch, I can agree. But somehow the whole thing just didn't come together. 


Sorry to say, I will not be returning to Primanti Brothers for said \"great sandwich\"."}
{"text":"This was my first Primanti's experience and it did not disappoint. I ordered a Pitts-burgher, which came out hot and smelled amazing. From the first bite to the last, SUCH a yummy sandwich. The hamburger meat was well-seasoned and tasty, but the slaw was the best part: shredded thin and perfectly sweet & vinegar-y. Will definitely visit Primanti's again next time I'm in town, maybe another location!"}
{"text":"I wanted Pittsburgh food, and the internets sent me here.  Do not be intimidated to walk in this dump.  I went to the take out line and ordered a spicy sandwich something or another.  The bartenders are either overworked or just don't give a shit cause I waited for a while before ordering.  But stay strong, and look them down until they take your order. PS make sure you get sauce in those little packets.  Sammich is at best 6/10 but is comes with fries on the sandwich, fries!! Isn't that crazy everyone, fries on a sandwich!"}
{"text":"I've loved this place since the first time I came years ago. Now that I'm a resident of Pittsburgh it is losing its \"cool\" factor a bit BUT the sanwiches are still awesome. Service can get busy around mealtimes (....of course) but definitely gotta go to this place once, if not more than that."}
{"text":"Like many Pittsburgh expats, I eat at Primanti's everytime I come back to visit.  The Harmarville location is notably worse than the Strip District location.  My corned beef was bland, and the coleslaw dry and flavorless.  I hope the whole chain isn't going downhill.  Next time I'm going to the Strip for my Primanti's fix."}
{"text":"Primanti's is the most overrated place in Pittsburgh.  I encourage everyone who is visiting the city to SKIP!  There are far tastier sandwich options (ex. Uncle Sams in Oakland/Squirrel Hill and Smallman St. Deli in the Strip).  If you absolutely have to try it, go to the Strip location for a drink."}
{"text":"We went to the Monroeville, PA location for lunch today and had a fantastic time! Our waitress Tara was absolutely sweet and wonderful, completely on top of our service and even took extra care of us as there was a bus load of people with their order in before us and she knew we waiting a few extra minutes. We told the manager how great she was and he was so nice and thankful not to mention that he was also working to fill the orders since they were slammed from the bus, which impressed us! What a good leader! She was also thankful when she found out why we wanted to thank her manager and complimented us for being nice. Our experience was wonderful and I'm always very thankful for great service and nice people!"}
{"text":"Don't do it.  We were out in Pittsburgh for the weekend and my husband wanted to try this restaurant.  It was the worst sandwich I have ever eaten in my life.  Two slices of at least an inch thick of tasteless white bread.  ONE slice of turkey heated on the grill so it was rubbery with perhaps a half of a slice of cheese.  Tasteless tomatoes.  A row of french fries that tasted as if the oil in the fryers had not been changed since they opened the restaurant.  A cup full of coleslaw that was so filled with vinegar that it almost tasted like medicine.  The cheese fries were also disgusting since the oil they were fried in gave them an almost rancid taste.  Don't waste your money.  I have no idea how this place survives and is open 24 hours a day.  It was 1 p.m. and the floor was so dirty it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a week or more."}
{"text":"Waitress & hostess were fantastic the last time I visited the restaurant (and every other time as well) .  Friendly, helpful & quick.  Have tried their known-for sandwiches a few times, they are a great quality sandwich.  The servers will gladly help you when ordering if your not familiar with the menu.  Lots of sandwiches to choose from, and they are reasonably priced.  They are a little messy to eat without some practice doing so, but luckily plenty of extra napkins available.  Chili is also very good, recommend the chili cheese fries also. This is a casual restaurant, very clean and they have TV's in the dining room."}
{"text":"Great Primantis location.  Clean, spacious, popular.  Good Primantis food.  Lately I have been enjoying the Gyro salad.  Kids like the hot dogs and fries."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband, excited to eat the famous sandwich.  Sandwich was good, but the lady at the bar where we sat at was so rude, she really ruined the entire experience.  I would never go back again.  As soon as we sat down she asked \"what are you having?\" to which I said water, and she looked at me, rolled her eyes, and got the water.  As soon as she comes back with it she asks, \"Do you know what you want yet?\" and I said \"Not yet\"....I'd never been there before!  Literally rolls her eyes again, huffs, and walks away.  I've never felt like more of an inconvenience in my life.  Keep in mind this was before lunch and they weren't that busy.  Sandwich was good, but I would not worth a return visit.  It's sad because I really wanted to like this place too! :("}
{"text":"Other than the Steelers, Penguins and maybe the Pirates, nothing says Pittsburgh like a sandwich stuffed with coleslaw and french fries and the words  \" Primanti Brothers \".

Open almost all night, fresh food and over-stuff sandwiches are the key ingredients to this successful business which now has. I believe, 7 in-town locations  ( Oakland, Strip District, 2 Downtown, South-Side, Heinz Field and PNC Park ) as well as 7, or more, suburban locations.

Eat one in and get another for your meal another day."}
{"text":"I love the white pizza and the Monongahela (bloody) Mary. Boyfriend always orders the Smallman Street fries & a huge, capicola sandwich. He can finish it every time! Not the cleanest place, but the food is consistently good and the beer is cold. A family go-to!"}
{"text":"To each their own when it comes to Priimanti Brothers, either love em or hate em.  I personally love this spot and can not get enough.  Got an appetite for a sandwich that will hit the spot and cure that hunger pain?  I suggest trying out Primanti's until you've tried every sandwich on their menu.  Fresh Mancini's bread, a very tasty coleslaw, fresh cut fries, and tomatoes.  Care to double up the Prim\"anti\"?  Double the meat and add a fried egg.  For those of you who can't handle the infamous Primanti Brothers sandwich I suggest you vacate the city and possibly even the state."}
{"text":"I got a triple-cheese Primanto Bros sandwich
Yum, the fries are really good. The coleslaw is sweet. And they are both in your sandwich!
They sell something like a \"cheese boat\" with fries around melty cheese that looks scary. Also, sixpacks of beer."}
{"text":"Food is as advertised. Service with a smile. 

Lovely outdoor seating. 

The bathroom needs a deep clean but otherwise the place looked spotless."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh tradition.  A must visit.  Capp n egg baby!!"}
{"text":"If you visit Pittsburgh, you must have a Primanti Bros sandwich just for the experience.  The menu is short, just order what you like and when it comes, don't think and DON'T ask for a fork and knife - just pick up the damn sandwich and eat!  Yes, slaw and fries will be falling out from between that fresh bread, but what makes it to you mouth is awesome.

BTW, if you visit the Cigar Bar location on the southside and you're wondering what to do for the rest of the day/weekend, just ask Casey.  She's a bubbling fountain of info on where to go and what to do!"}
{"text":"The original location, and truly a magical sandwich.   Italian bread, fresh. Topped with vinegar and black pepper cole slaw Topped with whatever meat you desire, grilled up hot.   Topped with a handfull of fresh cut french fries.   Topped off with provolone cheese.   TO DIE FOR!!!  This is the Pittsburgh Institution and quite possibly what the city should be known for.  Back in the college days, we used to show up at 3am to get one of these sandwiches so drunk we were seeing quadruple yet when we woke up we felt fine.  Remarkable."}
{"text":"After seing all the hype from TV, I came here with family local to Pittsburgh expecting delicious local eats.  Now I'm not even sure it's worth the experience of being able to say you've come here.

The portions are huge and cheap, but the buck stops there.  
The Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak wasn't cheesy or steaky.  The meat was more like a dried out morning sausage patty.  The \"Colossal Fish & Cheese\" sandwich was definitely colossal with a generous fried fish fillet, but the fillet had that old fishy taste... I almost prefer McDonald's Fillet-O-Fish.  The sandwiches are so big you wonder how you'll shove it all into your mouth, but when you finally manage, the flavor and texture contrast is really underwhelming despite the number of layers.  The bread is delicious and soft, the meat is so-so, the coleslaw makes everything vinegar'y, and the fries just make everything starchy in my mouth.

Alas I'm guilty of being a tourist here.  This place seems to be a more fun hang-out during game days when you're sharing a pint over the table.  Love the history of this place, not the food.  Isn't that why Beer is the #1 Seller over the Cheesesteak?"}
{"text":"Bad food on so many levels! Great marketing brings in the unsuspecting tourists for a variety of sandwichs made only with white bread, stuffed with boring french fries and coleslaw. My steak sandwich had hardly any meat. My friends kielbasa sandwich was cold, fattening and as heart stopping as all the other items.Service came with a smile."}
{"text":"Oh man. maybe i had a bit too much to drink the night before i went here, but it's totally an interesting idea: a nice melty ham and cheese sandwich with fries IN THE SANDWICH. this would be excellent. but they go a bit too far... they slather a big mound of coleslaw in there too. slaw gives me a bad case of the mouth sweats. fries were soggy, probably because of the slaw. perhaps i am not made for these eats."}
{"text":"Very unique experience. The fries and coleslaw on top of my burger was strange at first but pleasing to my taste buds. Small and a little noisy if you have a family, more of a bar scene. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Sandwiches are good and HUGE."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place, a bit rustic, greasy heaps of food with it's own unique tastes. Had a delicious cheesesteak. Fries and coleslaw on the sandwich, love it!!"}
{"text":"How do I put this. The food was not impressive, the service was terrible. Over all not the restaurant I will recommend. 

Me and my wife step in the restaurant and not one welcome us. We sit at the bar instead and it took a long time for them to take our order.  We order what they say the most popular item on the menu \"The Pitts-burger\" and it turns out to be a disaster. The beef patty taste not real beef. It's a street food level with strong chemical smell. I am aware of the sandwich will be a layer of fries in the middle. The fries is oblivious OVER COOKED and no flavor. The only highlight thing for the sandwich is the fresh tomato and bread. 

PS. When you sit at bar. If there is an old lady offering you some random Greek dessert, please don't buy it for your own good.  She said its one dollar each; but rather she took two dollars and one dollar for her 'tip'."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Primantis in the Strip District, but still gets the job done in a pinch."}
{"text":"I moved to the Pittsburgh area for a few months' job assignment and decided to try the iconic Primanti Bros. before I left PA.  I visited the original location in The Strip.

I arrived a little after 2 pm on a Wednesday.  It was fairly crowded (not packed) right at first, but more people were leaving than arriving.  After a little waffling, I decided that one room was too cold, so I went to the other and pretty quickly grabbed a two-top by the window as a couple were leaving.  Soon a waitress delivered food to a table nearby and then stopped at mine.  I ordered an Iron City and the most popular sandwich.  Waitress: \"Cheese  steak?\"  Me: \"Yep\".

The online menu for PB suburban location calls it \"The Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak (#2 Best Seller)  The original Almost Famous sirloin beef patty sandwich that feeds the spirited fans of Pittsburgh\"

The Iron City arrived promptly and was ice cold.  Good!  Very soon after my sandwich arrived.  Impressive looking.

I liked the slaw -- a tangy no-mayo variety.  (I hate mayo!)  I loved the fresh-cut fries.  (I never even bother to eat the frozen kind.)  The soft white sliced Italian bread was mild, fresh, tasty, and basically just stayed in the background.

The combination was winning, but I have to downrate the sandwich for one reason:  the meat patty.  I knew beforehand of course that it would be ground meat, not steak strips or shavings.  But I hoped for maybe a decent hamburger patty.  Instead it was this thing that I am at loss to describe.  Fine-textured mystery meat?  At least it was soft and easy to bite through.  I peeked at it and saw an obviously pre-packaged food substance that had those little cut marks all over it.  Pan-fried ground schnitzel?  It would be at home on a NY \"garbage plate\".  I'm not even sure it was beef.  It sorta reminded me of a Boca burger.

I quickly formed a theory about why this sandwich is advertised as \"#2 Best Seller\".  (Best seller is supposedly \"beer\" according to some reviews.)  This sandwich surely carries one of the highest profit margins for PB.  I have no doubt that it IS the most popular sandwich, but I suspect that the reason has more to do with the advertising than the quality.

People nearby were eating pastrami for the second time this week.  Another guy had corned beef I think.  If I ever return to PB I'll probably get one of those.  Maybe the Black Angus strip steak.

Unless you have a sentimental reason, or really insist on experiencing the least-common-denominator selection...

DO *NOT* ORDER THE CHEESE STEAK SANDWICH.

I think if you order something else you might rate PB 4 or 5 stars.  Taking the patty out of consideration, I LOVED the taste and concept of the sandwich.  But I just can't give a high ranking for a place that without warning serves the lowest quality meat."}
{"text":"don't come here if you are looking to have a light meal. they stuff every sandwich full of slaw, french fries and other condiments. this place is a staple in the area so i knew that i should visit the location. they have a special pburger sandwich which i guess is their most popular sandwich. they have cheap beer also. depending on what time you go here the surrounding area is either dead or filled with a lunchtime crowd. i suggest going during the day when there are more people around. at night time some shady people come out."}
{"text":"I wont bore people with a long review on this already well known place. 

If your in the Pittsburgh area you'd be a fool not to stop in at one of the Primanti Bros. locations and try one of there amazing sandwiches.  My favorite is either the Pastrami and cheese or the hot sausage sandwich but everything here is good. I live in boston and am used to paying twice as much for sandwiches which are no where near as good in quality and size."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place after a Pirate game to wait out the traffic. When it isn't busy the service is great and you can get a quick, cheap bite to eat. Always great to sit outside as well."}
{"text":"food is always good and the service is casual which can be my favorite at times.


always good for pick up! wings - incredible."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about Primanti Bros so when we were in Pittsburgh we had to check it out. We were both incredibly underwhelmed. The service was really good, the staff were very attentive and friendly. The sandwich ... eh. I've had much better many times over in a lot of other places. 

We ordered two different kinds and split them so we could try as much as possible. The fries tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in weeks with a weird kind of burnt flavor soaked into them. The meat was fine and plentiful but nothing special. The coleslaw that everyone raves about is not really unique or special... just less creamy than most are used to. 

Overall it's pretty cheap and easy for an on the go lunch or dinner, but it's just a sandwich and there are many other places I would choose to eat in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible! I was so excited eat at this Pittsburgh institution and I was disappointed. I tried to the steak and cheese and it was uneatable and I took one bite and had to throw the whole sandwich away. The fries were old and gross. I will NEVER come back here and NEVER recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a Pittsburgh classic right here. You walk in the place and it doesn't look like much. They serve beer here, which is awesome. The sandwiches come with meat of your choice, cheese, french fries, and coleslaw, and if you want, an egg. I usually get the Pastrami one, with egg. Egg is the only way to go. 

Their chili is really good as well, just make sure to get it with cheese and onion. 

As a fan of sandwiches and hoagies in general, this is about as good as it gets. 

They have TVs and bar seating as well in here. So it's a great place to go watch a sporting event with friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Pittsburgh for a wedding and spent the night in the Moon area  for a night. We decided to try Primanti brothers and we enjoyed our meal. The waiter was absolutely amazing and the rest of the staff was really nice."}
{"text":"I'm a local so I grew up with Primanti sandwiches, but it is a MUST HAVE for anyone who is visiting the burgh. The sandwiches are huge but delicious and the other items on their menu are also good. Great place to watch a game too!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting too much.  I was in the area for business and decided to give it a try.  I got the traditional sandwich but with turkey.
Completely unimpressed.  Nearly tasteless sandwich of tasteless meat piled with tasteless fries and tastless slaw.
So now I went there.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to Primanti Bros for first time last night since moving from Ohio.  We had family in town visiting and everyone wanted to see what the hype was about.  There were 8 of us.Well, first experience of Primanti less than impressed.  
 After they sat us one waitress rudely told the other that she needed to move the tables.  So we all had to stand back up move the 2 tables down and then sit back down.  Once we sat down one table leg was uneven so the table wobbled the entire time(table next to us had a napkin under one lag to level it out).  This showed lack of attention from management staff.  Told our waitress that none of us had ever eaten here before and asked what she recommended.  Her answer was \"I eat all of it\" we were hoping for a less generic response.  Every person that works in a resturant has tried multiple items and should be able to offer more assistance than that.  So everybody orderes something different.  Nachos and wings were excellent.
As for the sandwiches when we asked what the Pitts-burger was she said it was a ground beef patty with the fries and slaw.  I was expecting a hamburger patty which it was not.    Not sure what the meat was.  The turkey sandwich was good.  So the food was hit or miss.  
As we were eating a server spilled some drinks, which happens.  However when someone came to clean it up they slipped and used someone in our party to csth themselves and hit them in the back.  Again accidents happen but there was no sorry no are you ok.  
Overall service was poor and food was ok.  Less than impressed.  Kind of embarrassed tobtake family to a resturant that is supposed to be a Pittsburgh staple."}
{"text":"So happy we got to finish our trip here!! I've seen this joint on TV a hundred times and thought how good those sandwiches looked, well they didn't disappoint. Steak & cheese layered with delicious cole slaw on thick Italian bread, tomato & fries!! What a great idea & what a great sandwich! Perfect combo and perfect flavor, what more can I say - o yeah - our server ( I forget his name ) a little Italian guy was funny, sarcastic, friendly & so cool!! Perfect guy to serve these perfect sandwiches!! So happy we made it to Primanti Bros!! Go & be happy to!!"}
{"text":"Terrific sandwiches! I had a mix of corned beef and pastrami after consulting with the woman behind the counter. Note: there's also a cool neighborhood surrounding PB. 

Worth working into a future Pittsburgh trip!"}
{"text":"Primantis.  Used to be a pittsburgh institution that was the best. Not anymore. How the mighty have fallen. Strip district should be the only location you ever patronize."}
{"text":"The food, service, scenery, and atmosphere was terrific!!! I loved the Pitts-Burger Cheese Steak! It was so great with the fries and cole slaw inside of it. Also, it was my first time here, so they let me sample the chili before I tried. That was a great idea! I'm definitely coming back here :) I love how they don't use plates and just put the sandwiches on wax paper and serve it to you. It's a neat idea!"}
{"text":"Visiting from New York area we decided to try the ever so famous Primantis of Pittsburgh. WTFFFF??? Is this really Phg pride? If it is, it's a sorry excuse. We went to the chain one in Market Square (not the original one on 18th in the Strip). Everyone in our party looked at each other as if to say did that just happen?!? It was god awful. Salads came packaged in plastic to-go containers wih the dressing that came from the small pouch as well. We shared fries with chili,cheese, sour cream on top which was utter crap. Some fries were still raw potatoes and the other half were too soggy. The chili on top was canned, we had a couple bites and left it because it was just too bad to stomach. When our Pitts cheese steak sandwiches came we were starving. Took one bite and it was all over from there. I don't know what the burghs idea of a cheesesteak is but apparently it's a rubbery dog food texture like beef(?) patty with legitimately a half a slice of cheese. The fries on top were soggy again and tasted as if they were once frozen but instead of warming them up in the oven, someone was too lazy and threw them in the microwave. So soggy. The sandwiches were even worse than the appetizer fries that we ended up revisiting those sloppy fries just because they all of a sudden tasted like heaven compared to these sandwiches. 

Now, we are not foodies in the least. We don't follow places just because they were on tv (we didn't know primantis was on food network until someone had mentioned). We like to try new things and are not picky at all when it comes to food, but this place was simply inedible. 

Here's the part which we don't get: everyone raves about it. Friends of ours who have visited the original store have said it was delicious. Fans we talked to at the pirates game have unsolicited told us how good it was. WE DONT GET IT!!!! Were we at the wrong place? Should we really try the original store? Did we order the wrong thing?? Extremely disappointed none the less as this was our first Pittsburgh experience and impression and it was HORRENDOUS!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. It's worth the drive. There's a closer one to us but we love the original and Toni, the manager."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the country -- a little bit because of nostalgia, mostly because the sandwiches are Frick Park'n good.

I make sure we fit it in everytime we have a trip back to Pittsburgh.  I don't remember being a huge fan when I first went as a kid, asking them to hold on the coleslaw but it grows on you for sure.

I always get the roast beef."}
{"text":"Tasty food - a Pittsburgh classic. Definitely try the one in the Strip District if you can."}
{"text":"I read about this place in the book titled \"1000 Places to See or Do in the US\" and decided to go here when I was at a conference in Pittsburgh. If you are into plates this is not the place for you. Wax paper, which actually is a good idea if you don't want to do dishes...which I could become a convert to wax paper any day now, is what your meal is served on. HUGE sandwiches...I MEAN HUMONGOUS. They put everything on. Fries, meat, slaw, all together between two pieces of bread. Definitely worth the experience for a non Pittsburgh person. 

Upside: Quick prep of food. If you want a semi fast food place where you sit down and actually take time to eat, you can order and eat and be out relatively quick. Prices are great! 
Downside: It was packed during lunch and my buddies and I were crammed in. If you have a disability it will be hard to maneuver during peak times."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading all the hype I was unimpressed. I had the full boat signature sandwich that put this place on the map (capicola with the optional egg). It's impressive to look at and you can't look graceful eating it I guess that's the novelty of this place."}
{"text":"I'm with Patrick H. I give this place 3 Stars because the people who worked there were really friendly, but the sandwich sucked. Granted, I got cajun chicken, which I doubt is their strong suit, but I tasted my friend's pastrami and it wasn't any better.

The cole slaw is tasteless and slimy and the fries are soggy. The bread tastes stale and I don't even think it would be good if it were fresh.

Oh well. I still say you have to try it since it's such a Pittsburgh institution. And I know people who like them in the middle of the day and sober, too."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Old school feel atmosphere. Ordered a Pastrami sandwich and also tried the cheesesteak. The Pastrami was awesome and the way to go, but cheesesteak was average. They stuff Cole slaw and fries in the freshly made bread with the meat. A manly, filling, delicious meal. Got to get an IRON CITY light too drink."}
{"text":"Let me be clear. \"In Bernie's voice\"... I effin' hate Coleslaw. I really do. I always ask if I could sub it wherever it is offered. Not here. Something about Primanti's coleslaw, or it might be the way it blends with the meaty tastes of Pastrami or corned-beef. Or it could be that crazy Pittsburghese recipe that says hey jagoff add those fries on top on the coleslaw and meat whatever the meat is (ham, bologna, burger, turkey, pastrami, corned beef, chicken bits, what have you) and deal with it. Well that is the only time I like Coleslaw. At Primanti Bros. Any other place, no way. Gross. Thank you Primanti. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with some of my boys for a quick Pittsburgh lunch before heading back on our road trip. The service was great, request Mario, he was a beast. The bread and butter is excellent for a good price of 75 cents. I got the Pitt-burger which is ranked the #2 sandwich but there was no #1 which was weird. The coleslaw on my sandwich was over powering and took away from the taste of the sandwich. The fries and meat patty were subpar. Decent place but probably could've done better in the city of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Wow!  Very impressed with the food and staff/waitresses!    Chicken sandwich was the best I've had in a while.  Very tender.    They custom made BBQ chicken sandwich with Swiss Cheese and Bacon.   Huge side of fries came with it.    Buffalo wings just right.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"Huge bar and lots of wooden booth seating in the bar area create a great party ambiance and would def be an incredible place to watch a major sporting event. This is the epitome of greasy pub eating - not complaining about the food if that's what you're looking for- but even the salads have a deep fried feel to them lol. Not the place to go to stop in for a light meal. 
Bar service was a little slow as they were packed on a Saturday eve - but the table service was prompt and friendly and helpful to a couple kids from out of town."}
{"text":"We ordered pittsburger&cheese and the chili fries because of all the good reviews. The burger didn't come with burger buns but bread, i don't know why they called it a burger and not a sandwich. The coleslaw that came with the burger/sandwich was such a turn off, tasted weird, the fries were bland, soggy and sad, the patty was just cold (not freshly cooked) and no flavor at all. The chili didn't taste like chili, just some hot savory sauce with some meat. Was so disappointed because of all the hype."}
{"text":"The fries and 'slaw piled into all of the sandwiches is a cool local niche, but I'd say the overall quality of the sandwiches are just average otherwise."}
{"text":"I found Primanti Brothers to be average, despite its popularity in Pittsburgh. I was in town for a last minute day trip and thought that Primanti Bros. would be a good place to eat, especially since I heard about it years ago on the Food Network. After the fun of navigating the downtown area, we found Primanti Bros. and went inside. The place was fairly crowded, but not too bad considering the Pittsburgh Marathon had just ended. Seating is quick and our waitress came quickly. She was very nice and she had that gruff, old-Pittsburgh way about her. The food came pretty quickly. I had the sirloin strip sandwich (I think that's the name; if not it's something similar). The sandwich was decent. The Italian bread was crispy and the cole slaw and fries on the sandwich (something I've never had before) were good too. However, the small piece of meat was mediocre and unsatisfying. Overall, Primanti Bros. is a decent place to eat, but I'm sure there are better options in Pittsburgh (I'm not that familiar with the area though)."}
{"text":"heartburn city. did you know they put 30 packets of ketchup, mayo, and mustard in your to-go bag? when you think you got them all out, look again."}
{"text":"I got the pastrami and added roast beef so yea that was awesome. The coleslaw and fries tied it all together. It was great sober I'm confident it would be even better drunk!"}
{"text":"Here for the weekend and was told i had to try this place out.  The Pittsburger cheese steak was pretty bland.  Unseasoned beef, dry fries, mediocre slaw, and white bread.
Hopefully Pittsburgh has some better \"must eat\" places."}
{"text":"Known for their sandwiches with meat,french fries, and cole slaw stuffed between two slices of Italian bread, Primanti Brothers is a Pittsburgh institution.  I ordered the cheesesteak sandwich, the #2 seller according to the menu.  I'll let you figure out on your own what's #1.

At the first bite, it was a multitude of emotions at the same time.  The warm crispiness of the french fries, the crunch and cool sweetness of the cole slaw and the meatiness of the cheesesteak (which more like a beef patty).  And what amazed me was that the sandwich stayed intact after taking the bite, no debris has fallen off.  It's definitely a combo meal in one hand!

It's an amazing sandwich, one of the best I've ever have.  You should definitely stop by there whenever you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"AMAZING Sandwich!!   It was a great atmosphere in Market Square in the middle of Pittsburgh.  Nothing fancy, sandwich comes in paper and the drinks are in paper cups but the sandwich's are awesome.  I first saw this restaurant on Man vs Food and it looked great, the restaurant did not  disappoint!"}
{"text":"It's fun to have one of their disgusting sandwiches every once-in-awhile, but most of the time it's best to steer clear of this place packed full of obnoxious patrons."}
{"text":"Stopped Friday evening for takeout.The place wasn't busy when I arrived. Placed order at bar. Waited over an hour and got no food. Had to ask bartender to have someone check on it, was told it would me one minute, 5 minutes later, still no food. Cancelled the takeout order, paid for drinks (you'd think they would have comped since I was waiting forever for food) and left. No apologies, no manager interaction, nothing but a woman in an apron who came running out of the kitchen as I was leaving telling me my food would be ready in another 5 minutes, I left and got a hoagie from Get-Go. I won't be back again - shame too, because their sandwiches are usually pretty good, the service was the problem here.

*Follow up* E-mailed Primanti's corporate regarding this experience. They requested additional information and followed up with the location. The Harmarville story took full responsibility and admitted there was confusion and they dropped the ball. Customer service sent a gift card based on my experience and advised training will be provided and the incident reviewed as a learning experience. I will give them another try and hope the next visit meets the expectation to which I am accustomed."}
{"text":"Can Pittsburgh get a new \"iconic\" food item please?  I come here once in a blue moon to introduce an unsuspecting visitor to this regional specialty, aka soggy bread with limp fries and wilted lettuce.  Bland and mushy and messy.  Given that they proudly sell Primanti t-shirts at the airport, I guess this place won't be going away any time soon."}
{"text":"The people commenting on this are ridiculous. Don't come if you expect a 5 star waiter to be ready to pay attention to you and you only. Primantis is delicious. Capicola, egg and cheese is the way to go."}
{"text":"Ok, seriously. This is the worst sandwich I have ever had. Its a frozen patty with lousy fries on white bread. I understand that this place is an institution, but the food is not good...its not even medium. Its just bad."}
{"text":"All the ingredients go together perfectly! I thought the sandwich would be falling apart, but it held together from first bite to last. I asked for an egg in my cheese steak. Probably the best sandwich I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"U can't go wrong here!! There sandwiches are amazing. Fresh bread.. Its just great! Come for a Steelers game pens game or any other Pittsburgh sporting event they usually have $1 beers. AWESOME! $1.50 pizza slices that are huge and they run other specials during games too. There chili is to die for. Try there chili cheese French fries mmm!! My favorite is the Turkey sandwich with chili cheese French fries! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I was a tourist in Pittsburgh. Even though I had heard that overrated rumors swirling about Primanti Bros, I would be remiss if I didn't at least give it a shot.

I have to say, I actually enjoyed it very much.

We got there a little after noon. I expected it to be wall to wall people with us waiting for forever. Instead, we walked right in and sat down at the counter. Perfect.

I got the capicola and cheese with an egg added on. The first bite was actually surprising because the coleslaw was unlike anything I've had on a sandwich before, but by bite two I couldn't get enough of it. Delicious. The fries and bread are a bit soggy, but it all seems to work.

If and when I go back to Pittsburgh, I'll probably eat here again. Pretty good sandwich. I gave it the extra star because it's a cool experience, even if it is a little touristy.

One thing to be aware of that is incorrect on Yelp as of right now - this place does NOT accept credit cards. Cash only. Be prepared."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning. Went with the pastrami and cheese. It was absolutely delicious. The pastrami was lean tasty battery and warm through out. The fries added the perfect snap and the cole slaw was amazing. Greatest breakfast I ever had."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I'm sorry Pittsburghers but I just don't get this place. Yes, I tried smothering that red sauce all over the sandwich. Still doesn't make the cut. Also, if you need to completely smother something with a condiment, doesn't that mean it's not very good in the first place?"}
{"text":"The build up to eating at Primanti Brothers was huge. When I mentioned Pittsburgh, I would invariably get the question of whether or not I was eating there. So, what a let down when I finally did. Honestly, what is the big deal about the sandwiches? 

This Primanti Brother's location is basically a bar that serves sandwiches to over-sexed University of Pitt coeds, that get drunk and loudly discuss their latest failures with men for all to hear. The music is very loud, the patrons drunk and yelling, so don't expect to have much of a conversation with your dining companions. You'll be too busy trying to fit an unnecessarily large sandwich in your mouth.

I got what their menu said was the #2 most requested Primanti Brother's sandwich, that one might think is the best they have to offer, but what I got was a some kind of meat patty with undercooked fries, cole slaw and tomato between two pieces of italian bread. It was a tasteless mess. No favor at all, except for the vinegar taste in the cole slaw. 

I know Pittsburgh has flavor, because I found it at Aiello's Pizza (http://www.yelp.com/biz/aiellos-pizza-pittsburgh)."}
{"text":"um, are people joking?  this was one of the worst sandwiches i've ever had in my life - plain white bread (looked store-bought, like wonder bread), soggy fries, and completely bland meat.  the whole thing was bland and tasteless.  ugh - this place is completely overrated and overhyped, and appears to be surviving off of its reputation.  it's certainly not because of the food.  never again!"}
{"text":"Quite tasty sandwiches, although I don't really understand the appeal of fries inside the sammies. I always take them out and eat them separately. Call me traditional. 
Greasy, as could be expected, but delicious after drinking or if you're craving a hefty meal for any other reason besides a futile attempt to divert alcohol from destroying your liver. 
And speaking of alcohol, they have the cheapest beer in town! Not quite sure how they sell Yuengling for $2. Might be stolen goods. I'm ok with that. 
Certainly not gourmet, interesting food that I couldn't make myself, so I just can't bring myself to give them above a 3, but for what it is, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"one of the best sandwiches i ever had.

worth the drive from Canada all the way the Pittsburgh than to my hometown"}
{"text":"The original Pittsburgh sandwich is no joke. There's reasons why this place has lines out the door. Absolute perfection between two pieces of bread gives this place amazing feel. When you see pictures of famous people there, it's gotta be good. This place makes you feel like you're home in Pittsburgh. Just pure sandwich bliss"}
{"text":"Lifelong Pittsburgher here, wherever  I am at, wherever I go, if there is a Primanti Bros. around that's where I want to eat I absolutely love the sandwiches ( the wife & I have our on nickname, we call the samich ). Recently I was in the Monoreville area and stop there for a samich, it was fresh off the grille and bad to the bone good told the waitress the cooks in the back did a great job, so much so the samich rivaled what you get in the strip....freakin awesome, definitely be back for another when in the area. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MONROEVILLE"}
{"text":"primantis is not for everyone. ill admit that its not this fantastical godsend some people make it out to be. its a big greasy sandwich with a unique combination of ingredients that can be hit or miss depending on your personal tastes and how you order it.

why do i love primantis so much, then? because it is the hearts and soul of pittsburgh manifested in the form of a loaded sandwich. if you are from pittsburgh, even if you dont particularly like the sandwiches, primantis probably means something to you. its another point of pride for the city (or its sons and daughters) to rally around. just like the steelers, or the pens, or the goofy accents. its part of what makes pittsburgh unique and wonderful.

whenever i go home to visit, it has become a sort of ritual for me to get one. i do this because i cant get it anywhere else, its a distinct piece of home. i think i actually go to primantis more now than i did when i lived in pittsburgh. 

as far as my personal preferences, i like to go with either the corned beef or the pastrami with hot sauce and ketchup and if im feeling sassy ill get a fried egg on it.

the local favorite is the cheese steak, however i dont really find it that great. last time i got it i had the worst farts ever, i cant verify whether or not they were the sandwichs fault. if you would like to try the cheese steak anyway, i would like to warn you that its not what you typically think of when you hear \"cheese steak.\" its more comparable to a hamburger patty that a regular cheese steak. 

lastly, i want to make note of the fact that primantis is open 24 hours. this is great because primantis is the perfect drunk food. after all the bars close at 2 and you are wandering around the strip or southside, all boozed up with the munchies you can always rely on primantis to be there for you. and when this moment happens and you eat that sandwich, in your hungry inebriated state, it will be the most delicious food you have ever tasted.

i recommend primantis to anyone visiting pittsburgh, youre not going to get anything like it anywhere else and it will help you feel the full effect of the town. if you live there you should probably be eating one right now."}
{"text":"I mean come on its Primantis. Yea some times they get busy and the service lacks but I imagine they go through a lot of employees. The food is great. I just came back from vacation and their portions were about half of what you get here."}
{"text":"God I miss this place. Best sandwiches in the Burgh. If you are down near the Strip, you have got to swing by here. Get the pastrami or roast beef and do not ask for the slaw or fries on the side. It's all on there for a purpose and it is a gloriously messy sandwich."}
{"text":"It's one of the signature restaurants in Pittsburgh because they have fries in the sandwich. The portion is huge, so if you're not that hungry, you probably want to share it with another friend or take the other half home. I'm not a big fan of the cole slaw here, so the sandwich tastes good instead of great to me. I've also been to the one in downtown when waiting for 2013 to come."}
{"text":"Great place for sandwich and beer. Great service. Had capicola and corn beef. I normally hate coleslaw but all sandwiches come with coleslaw on them so I figured in would give it a go. Amazing. Would go again.  Coleslaw is still disgusting on its own."}
{"text":"Yinzers around the burgh unite! Primanti's is a permanent staple in any real Pittsburghers' diet. Heaps of delicious deli meat, stacked on fresh locally baked bread, blanketed with zesty cole slaw and crispy fries...mmmmmm! Brush up on your \"pittsburgh-ese\" and go have a sandwich and a brew!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of fries on my sandwich.    Got the t-shirt as a gift."}
{"text":"Place was pretty good. First time in Pittsburgh over the past weekend. Chilli cheese fries were awesome! And the #2 best seller was ok I guess. It was good but I didn't love it. .."}
{"text":"it's been close to 5 years since i've had primanti's, but after being disgusted by a knock off in chicago (i'm talking about you Lucky's).. i had to come back to give props to primanti's.

i don't remember what i ordered, but do remember ordering two sandwiches only to come back 4 hours later to order another.  i do remember the monstrosity of the sandwich w/o skimping out on the meats and w/ a good ratio of meats, fries, and slaw."}
{"text":"Overstuffed mouthwatering sandwhich! But wait there's more!? Don't forget the fries and the coleslaw. Simply delectable."}
{"text":"Great food overall at all locations! Go to another location to eat though. The Market Square location has the most horrible service I've ever experienced. Horrible!"}
{"text":"It's not a sandwich I would have again, but the all in one, Pitts-burgr is a must do thing which makes your trip to the Burgh complete. 

If you are not a stickler for doing \"the thing\" then I think you could get an all in one (fries and slaw on the sandwich) in any of the other 2-dozen options: streak, pastrami, turkey, chicken, etc. 

But, I like to do the thing, even if it's not my personal choice for a sandwich. So, I sank my teeth into a giant mess inside Italian sourdough bread. It was interesting, tasty but once is enough. (

I actually went before with a friend after passing through town and going to a Pirates game in the early 90's but I can not remember what I got, only that it had fries in it. I would expect that I skipped the slaw, as I hate coleslaw. 

This time I went full Monte and was pleased that it was good. The burger is a bit weird, more like a strange lunch meat than a burger. There was just too much slaw and fries and I had to thin it down to actually eat it. 

What stands out is how great the staff was--explained everything, filled drinks and brought everything very quickly. They even let my son taste the chili so we did not have to order it and just take a chance. 

So, this is your charge if you dare to have the real-deal Pittsburgh experience. Are you man enough?"}
{"text":"ALWAYS my first stop when back in the Burgh.  Folks need to lighten up -- it is a sandwich joint.  Not fine dining.  Cold, cheap beer and sammies with fries and slaw on them -- the way they have been doing it since the 1930s.  Thats what the advertise and that's what they deliver -- every time.    Cap and cheese with a frosty IC Light -- heaven."}
{"text":"Flavorful sandwiches, the fries are delicious but could have been hotter. Even though I went with a large group (30+). Overall good. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If your stuck, it's food! Sandwichs are \"piled high\" with French fries. I asked about specials on beer and was not told that if I waited 6 minutes that it was happy hour and half price beers. Not cool! People in my group were still eating and the bill was plopped on the table. No better hint to get out. Like I said, if your stuck for a beer and a bite, it'll do."}
{"text":"I love their HUGE sandwiches. I can barely finish one half. The slaw is a vinegar based one and very tasty."}
{"text":"\"You HAVE to try Primanti Bros!\" they told me. They were right. While I had had a long day of travel and would have eaten just about anything by that time, I thoroughly enjoyed my genoa salami sandwich (though I wish they would have stuffed a little more cole slaw in!) And the tots - we ordered the tots with horseradish sauce and I could have stuffed myself with those alone. Crispy, salty, delicious - the way tots should be! Washed it all down with one of their local craft beers. Mmm.

I smelled like French fries all night but it was worth it."}
{"text":"The food is just decent i dont know what the fuss is about this place, i suppose my expectations were just to high"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and went anyways thinking it can't be as mediocre as everyone says.  It is, in fact, that mediocre.  

I ordered the Pitts-burgr for the experience and it was a great big meh.  I'm not sure there was salt anywhere near those fries or burger patty.  I'm not normally one to put more salt on food after it comes out of the kitchen but I found myself salting almost every bite.  If it wasn't salt it was ketchup or hot sauce.  Based on the shape of the patty it seemed to be a frozen patty.  The fries could have used more time in the fryer - some were in the realm of undercooked.  The slaw seemed like it might have been scooped out of a 5 gallon bucket purchased from Sysco or something.

On the bright side the service was great.  The two guys working were both very friendly and eager to please.  And the bread was nice and fresh."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh tradition. Every time I have a friend that comes in from out of town it is a must stop. They are the innovators of the \"sandwich\". Its a local staple. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is great. The staff is also very friendly. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! I would definitely recommend coming by if you are visiting the city as I was. Friends highly recommended and were spot on. I loved the atmosphere and will make it a point to stop by again in the future."}
{"text":"This is the most overrated eatery in pittsburgh. Native peeps will take advantage of every opportunity to brag about their beloved primanti bros. Don't listen to them. I've debated the merits of primanti's with my friend, Eric (pretty much the most magnificent person in all of pittsburgh (if not the world)). But, not even Eric's dulcet tones could voice a convincing argument for primanti bros. \"Uhhh, well, primanti bros was featured in a national geographic issue\" -- yeah, and that's why the national geographic should just stick to covering animals and shit. 

Bottom line:
Unless you're a fan of soggy fries with mounds of cole slaw served on dry crumbling bread, primanti bros will only lead to disappointment."}
{"text":"The food is cheap, but not a lot of meat on the sandwich. The fries on top of the sandwich were cold but the coleslaw on the sandwich was great."}
{"text":"I've been coming here my whole life. It has it's amazing and it's bad moments. Every time I come back from a trip and drive through the fort Pitt tunnels all I can think about is primanti bros"}
{"text":"Best zucchini fries I've ever had. My wife and I ordered that and fried chicken salad. The fried chicken on the salad was good too. Generous salad portions. We shared everything and it filled us up and we didnt have to order anything else. Friendly quick service."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple!  Nothing beats a sandwhich topped with French Fries and Coleslaw.  Great for late night too"}
{"text":"A classic Pittsburgh experience.
OK - I'll agree that everyone should experience a Primanti sandwich. But having experienced it, I'll tick it off my bucket list. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either."}
{"text":"Visited with my dad yesterday for the first time ever, and to be honest, was a bit disappointed after all the hype. I ordered the egg and cheese sandwich, which was ok, but didn't have enough flavor, in my opinion. Next time I'll definitely spring for the option of paying $.50 for extra cheese. The fries and coleslaw were good though. The only real flavor I was getting was from the coleslaw though."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh classic :) I can't say it's my favorite food, but you must try it, having coleslaw and fries in the sandwich!"}
{"text":"when i was at CMU, there were a few items which i needed to get over the idea of living in pittsburgh for five years - that's the length of the architecture school people so shush - 

i needed copies of every new calvin & hobbes books which came out.  and the second thing was the kielbasi sandwich at primanti brothers.  not at the one in the strip.  but this one on forbes.

of course i get the fries and slaw on it.  how could you not like the slaw here?  i judge all other slaw i've ever had since the first time i bit into the slaw with my first kielbasi sandwich.  so far no go.  their slaw isn't like other slaws.  there's something in it like heroin.  because i used to lick my glued and inked up hands shaking from the third continuous all nighter just to get all the juices running.  

and if you ask nicely, they'll put the fries on the side.  though you should ask yourself why.

forget the cheesteak.  it's the kielbasi.  the cheesesteak is for tourists."}
{"text":"Why it took me so long to become a fan is beyond me.  Yes, I heard about Primanti's from friends and co-workers for years and never tried them.  It's when they went franchise, and bicoastal is when I tried them. 

I must say that they are so very tasty!! Everything I've tried have been a sports bar meal favorite!!  Each time I've had the BEST service, and have been more than satisfied with the food.  Usually I'll get one of their delicious Grilled Chicken Salads, topped with everything you can think of.  I love their signature sandwiches, and you have to get it WITH the cole-slaw. YUM, yummies!!  Not everybody likes the coleslaw, so I was very surprised to say that it is GREAT!  Fit's perfectly for this PITTSBURGH created staple!

Anyway, go on in!! It's especially fun for Steeler, Penguin or even Pirate games!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and was in town for the Steelers game. This place was highly recommended, but was a disappointment. The place was dirty and the burger their known for was awful. The coleslaw and fries on the burger were good but the burger itself was not flavorful at all."}
{"text":"It was very odd.  I ordered the corn beef sandwich, but it was cold and the corn beef had a strange texture.  They did not serve the salad until after the meal.  They brought my two year olds food ten minutes after the adults were served, and the kids meal came with a ridiculousness amount of food (only reason two stars instead of one.)  They messed up the bill by about five dollars on a $30 bill and then were very rude about fixing it."}
{"text":"Maybe I just wasn't drunk enough, but I don't understand what the rave is about Primantis...Its just not good food. what is that meat, anyways??"}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday for the first time and the real thing definitely lives up and to the legendary name. My friends and I got some bomb fried pickles great beer and excellent Vegas bombs. The bartender was cute sweet and super speedy despite being the only one behind the bar on a busy night. She even some cool stuff we should check out while visiting Pittsburgh. I loved the food and was blown away by the service I will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Wow. Can a sandwich be any worse? During a visit to Pittsburgh, everyone we talked to said we HAD to go there. Most of us ordered the steak sandwich. Now, I wasn't expecting a Philly cheese, nor was I expecting a New York strip. I had been told what this sandwich was. So when the \"sandwich\" arrived with the gray meat product covered in soggy frozen fries and bitter slaw, I tried it they way they served it. To say it has no flavor is an insult to flavor. It was bland, nada, nothing. So a few of us tried ketchup or hot sauce. I gave up after two bites and threw mine away. It was that bad. Only saving grace for me was the cold Yuengling in my hand. 

This place sucks. I had one person tell me it was an acquired taste. No, it's not. There is no taste to acquire. It's just bad late night drunk food. Maybe if it had been 1 am and I was ready to sleep in the gutter it would have been palatable. 

Sorry Pittsburgh, love the town, but that's the worst  local joint I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Great place! Even though it was packed, we were served right away. Quick service. Only possible downsize is that it is cash only...."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Great atmosphere.  If you don't like this place, there is something wrong with you. 
Go steelers!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for work, and after a solid week at the convention center a coworker and I ventured out for a true taste of city. 

The two of us ordered the roast beef and the pastrami and swapped half - good move. We pretty much let the waitress order for us, and that's the direction she steered us -- we we not led astray. 

When our server brought our food (about 90 seconds after we ordered it) she said we were lucky the bread was extra fresh, and she wasn't kidding. We dominated those ginormous tasty heaps of sandwich in record time. 

Was is the best sandwich I've ever had? Nay. Was it worth the calories? Absolutely. I will go back if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Easily the best sandwich I have ever ate. I can see why year after year this sandwich ranks tops in the country. I never had a sadnwich with cole slaw and french fries on it, needless to say it is just as good as it sounds. If you are ever in Pittsburgh, eating here is a must!"}
{"text":"If I could give this review a little lower then 1* I would. Who ever tells you this spiceless place is good has lost there mind. That place has the most bland food I think I have ever had in my life and I have been to a handful of countries outside of the USA.  Seriously, we watched the fries being cooking nonstop and not ONCE.... I mean ONCE did they put salt on the fries... Nor did they ever do that to any food they cooked, the most the did was put egg on top of steak and cheese without any spice at all.  Like who the hell does that besides this place. I would give it a true - 3* of I could"}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh Primanti's. Great place to watch a game and get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"It's Primanti's, it's the best drunk sandwich you will find in Pittsburgh! it's friggin awesome. 

If you are mentioning \"service\" in a review of Primanti's, you're a jag off."}
{"text":"For years my friends from Pittsburgh have raved about this place and I had to try it out.  I wasn't disappointed and it has become one of my favorite sandwiches in the country.  I can't wait to be in the area again so I can delight my tastebuds again."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come to this place for many years after seeing it on tv with multiple different hosts.  Finally, we got here on a very rainy Memorial Day weekend.  Fast-moving line outside under the awning kept us relatively dry.  I got an IC light and a pastrami and cheese.  Wife got sweet sausage and egg.  First half of the sandwich was excellent, I couldn't put it down. I couldn't put it down anyways fearing half the stuff would fall out.  By the second half, the fries start to get a little heavy, and slightly dries out the sandwich.  Ketchup and hot sauce on every table helps the rest slide down easily.  Pastrami was definitely better and more flavorful than the sausage. Will return when I reach pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"I heard this place stacks fries and cole slaw onto your sandwich so I gotta try it. I ordered the drunk duck drink and it was fantastic. I got to keep the little rubber ducky on top of my drink too :)  As for the sandwich, I got the deluxe double egg and cheese.  The portion was HUGE and very messy!  More messy than boogers coming out from a runny nose.  The sandwich I got was really good and filling.  I would recommend this place for visitors from afar and who happens to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I will most likely get slain to a cross for this, but I am not a huge fan of Primanti's. I like it's appeal, though. Tag words may include but are not limited to: Drunk, hungry, work men, sloppy, and a Piksburgh tradition. The fries are outstanding and fresh, as well as the Italian bread they put the sandwiches on (which is distributed from a local bakery), and the pastrami is juicy and delicious. I never really loved the coleslaw thing, and you could probably order it without, but I wouldn't suggest it... My tastebuds just never adapted to it. It's convenient. Parking is usually not hard to find, depending on which location you're at. I personally prefer the Southside location. You can always order a beer here! It's also relatively inexpensive. Give it a try! Ya might like it."}
{"text":"You know they never get credit for the excellent PIZZA.. YUM YUM YUM. Tuesday and Thursdays are their pizza specials. OMG its a bang for your buck. All wings for a small price. Get the fried pickles. You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"I love reading the negative reviews because those people are not from Pittsburgh and not properly prepared for a visit. First off if your expecting 5 star restaurant go somewhere else! This is deli style place that has attitude, the fries are hand cut and the cole slaw is oil and vinegar based, they don't season any meat but if you want a great sandwich and you are not timid, then go, eat and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The food was just OK. Soggy french fries on a greasy cheese steak pattie.  The service was awful, noise, and not helpful for a newcomer to Primantis and Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Man vs Food and thought I would check it out. I ordered the pastrami with cheese. The sandwich was humongous!!!! It was filled with cheese, pastrami, coleslaw and french fires. It was very messy to eat but it was so good. I only drawback to this place was the service. My waitress was not very friendly and she got my order mixed up with the table next to me. She didn't even apologize for the mix up. Other than that it was a great experience and I recommend anyone who is going to the steel city to get some Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for an early lunch on a weekday after walking around the Strip. I quickly checked Yelp to see where to eat and thought this looked worth trying. Also had heard (or read, I can't remember now) several positive comments elsewhere that suggested this is THE place in Pittsburgh for lunch. 

We wandered in and took seats at the counter. There were families, businessmen, couples, and singles filling the place. After looking around a few minutes we were greeted by a waitress who took our order. They don't have menus, just big signs on the wall. 

My husband and I split a cheesesteak which came with fries on it (a great selling point!) and coleslaw ON the sandwich. I guess there is a reason they call it a \"Philly\" cheesesteak other places, and we should have realized that a cheesesteak in Pitt. isn't the same. 

The fries on the sandwich were really good. The meat was okay, it was more like a meatloaf sandwich to me, and the coleslaw was more on the vinegary side than sweet. Again, I probably should have know this going in, but I'm not from Pitts. so I didn't. If you're into those kinds of things, this is your place. If not, it's not. It was pretty tasty for what it was, but wouldn't be my first choice again."}
{"text":"Used to be Tuesday night regulars, then we got a couple raw pizzas and the service were downhill (if you get Crystal, good luck).

The last time was so bad I emailed the GM, but never got a response. 

We went back tonight for the first time in months. It wasn't busy, which isn't a shock considering how our last couple experiences were. Stacy took care of us and was great. The service was much better."}
{"text":"I've never had one of their sandwiches before. I was talked into having on for lunch today. I'll never do it again. I bought the black angus burger. I had to keep checking it as I ate it as I couldn't tell there was meat (flavorless) on the bread considering the sweetness of the cabbage. And don't get me started on the fries. I just threw away 8 buck."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. fries, pickled Cole slaw and tomato on the sandwich. Pastrami or corned beef are popular. Outside seating. Casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"I'm an old Pittsburgh guy who is back for a visit after many years. I still can't understand what everyone who raves about Primanti's likes about this place. The food is greasy, tasteless and sloppy. I had a hot sausage sandwich; the sausage had no taste, let alone spice, the coleslaw was mediocre, and the bread was stale. The only reason I give the place more than one star is the great fries; otherwise, it would be the bottom of the barrel. There are so many better sandwich places in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"As far as Primantis goes, this is my favorite location. The staff are all friendly and quick and I've never had a bad experience.

I usually avoid going there during \"peak hours\", because it gets insanely busy. During the weekends you can usually see a line of suburbanites and out-of-towners wrapping around the block waiting to get inside just to say they ate at Primantis.

Personally, I usually stop here after late summer night bike rides for some carbs and a beer. Capicola & egg is the way to go."}
{"text":"Ok so when I hear Pittsburgh, one thing comes to mind and it is NOT the Stillers(Steelers). I went to school about an hour north of Pittsburgh, so I listened to enough out of Steelers fans to last me a lifetime throughout my 5 years of college. 

Primanti Bros might just be one of my favorite things about Pittsburgh. I've eaten at several of the locations, including the one on Forbes Avenue, however I have been to this location more than any other locations since it is on the way to a college buddy's house when I make it out to visit him. The place has always been clean, although the service at times has been slow. Even with the slow service on occasion, the service has been friendly enough and I am usually catching up with friends I haven't seen in awhile, so no big deal to me.

Primanti Bros sandwiches are something that you will probably wonder how in the heck it can taste good, when you first hear about them. The sandwiches are on some thick cut Italian bread with the meat, cheese, french fries, and cole slaw piled on. The first time I heard of this concoction, I was a little leary that it would taste good. One bite later, I am hooked for life! I know a lot of the Primanti Bros locations serve things other than the sandwiches, but trust me and get one of their \"almost famous\" sandwiches if you have never gotten one. The sandwich itself is typically enough for a meal without ordering any sides. This was actually the original selling point for Primanti Bros, as they were made to be a meal on the go for the many truck drivers in the Strip district.  Some of my favorites are the capicola and cheese, pastrami and cheese, and the cajun chicken sandwiches. If you feel the need to get a side, I would go with the chili. I have gotten this a few times and have not been disappointed.  

Primanti Bros is one of those places I would say is a must visit if you have never been to Pittsburgh and are looking to grab a bit of local flavor!"}
{"text":"Concept is fine but the food is just garbage. I can dig the idea of putting all of the different parts of the meal on one bun, it's not that original afterall, but the food still has to be good. Everyone raves about this place, after trying it, it's clear this place is really just famous for being famous and no one with taste knows why, that's right, it's the Kim Kardashian of sandwich shops. The fries were mushy, even without touching the slaw, only crunch was the uncooked potato in the center of the fry, lunch meats are just super cheap processed crap, and the burger is totally garden variety, top it off with cheap wonder bread type bread (not toasted and not Italian to the reviewer who has clearly never eaten either) and you've got a perfectly mediocre meal worth skipping. At least with subway you expect the disappointment. Oh, and the service was awful, disappointing food is bad enough, waiting a half hour to order it is just a waste."}
{"text":"Back in June, we had a terrible experience with food at the North Versailles location of Primanti Brothers. Ben B. of Primanti Brothers was extremely nice and addressed our problem. He delivered dinner to our home and gave us a generous gift certificate.

We have used the certificate twice now at the Monroeville location and the food was great. On Friday, November 1, 2013 we visited the restaurant again with friends. We had a great meal and I had $10.20 remaining on the card. When the waitress brought our bill, we gave her the gift card. She took the card and came back stating that it wouldn't go through because their \"gift card\" reader wasn't working. She proceeded to say that we couldn't use it at that time. We paid for our meal.

My concern is that there's not a \"Plan B\" if the gift card reader isn't working. What if a family receives a gift card and takes their family out to dinner and doesn't necessarily have the funds to pay for the meal if the \"gift card\" reader isn't working? I know plenty of families that could fall into this scenario."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh Classic!

Doesn't get better than this! 

Turkey, Steak, Fish are my Favorites!"}
{"text":"Would a stop in Pittsburgh really be a stop in Pittsburgh if I didn't stop into Primanti Brothers to have a sandwich?  Absolutely NOT.  I swear, we landed, checked into the hotel, and then immediately went to the first Primanti Brothers we saw and ordered their #1 and #2 best sellers.  Then we burned the place to the ground so nobody makes that mistake again. You're welcome.

Things to try: I find the ashes from the burnt remnants of this establishment to be slightly better than their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, and fast service. This was my second try at Primanti Bros. and was extremely happy I tried for a second time. First experience was at another location in Oakland and the experience, food, and service was mediocre at best. This location lived up to the hype and I would definitely recommend and come back again."}
{"text":"The food was a little cold but I still enjoyed it.  The waitress was very polite and I loved the atmosphere"}
{"text":"I love this Primanti's,  I always come here to watch a fight or game.  It doesn't feel the same as the dowtown or Oakland locations....but you also don't have to worry about crackheads, drunks and insane people bothering you before, during and after your meal.  I love the jumbo fish & colossal fish & cheese!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited the Primanti Brothers in Monroeville and it was horrible.  Each aspect of our visit.  Service was horrible.  The wait staff stood in the back and ignored us. They were horrible. We were there almost 15 minutes before anyone took our order (we should have left by then but it was late and we were hungry).  The food was horrible.  I ordered a bowl of vegetable soup and it was broth with cabbage in it.  Period.  My husband's sandwich took forever to be delivered to him and then it was wrong.  During the time we had our food we kept waiting for someone to check on us and ask about our food and no one....I mean no one ever showed up.  Once the Manager finally showed up and we told him all that was wrong he seemed offended that we complained.  He said he'd adjust our bill and after 10 minutes we found him and said 'what the heck is going on?  Where is our check?'  He got nasty with us again, and said something like 'Fine, it's on me.'  Never apologized for any issues we'd had.  I will never, ever return to a Primanti Brothers ever.  Ever."}
{"text":"The beer selection is limited to what you might find in convince store (in states where this is possible. Sandwiches are Pittsburgh landmarks though and the food is good but nothing truly special. Great place to hang with friends, catch a game and chow down."}
{"text":"best sandwich i ever had. we travel to pittsburgh 4x a year and everytime we make sure we eat at primanti brothers in downtown pittsburgh, that is our little tradition.
i usually get the kielbasy sandwich, sooo good, they deep fry the kielbasy, does it get any better? yum!"}
{"text":"What can you say it is a Primanti's!! Gotta love the sandwiches and it is always a great place to hang out with friends. Plenty of space for large parties after the kids games in the dining room or the bar area. Love the beer selection and love the service, always a great time!! This is a can't miss place to hang out!"}
{"text":"A good friend, \"Homeslice,\" told me I had to visit this chain as it was something he had to do before he \"kicked the bucket.\"  Pressure much?  

While making a turn looking for a fudge place, I ran into Primanti Brother's.  Looking at the Yelp reviews, I happened to find the original.  It was meant to be = )  

I parked, stepped outside in 37F weather, and a breeze of fried sweetness surrounded me.  Feels/looks like a pub, 24-hr, cash only spot, and known for their coleslaw and french fry stuffed sandwiches.  You can order as sides but why not try it the way they make it, right?

I ordered the corned beef and cheese - $6.29 (includes tax).  After a bite, I softly said, \"Oh...my...God\"  Yumminess!!

-Corned beef: maybe 5 thin slices with a small layer of swiss cheese.  Juicy but not too much.  Just enough salt.  Covers the entire span of the bread.  You can order double meat for $1.99.  I didn't need.
-Fries: majorly fried, still soft, and sweetly seasoned.  About a handful is added to the meat and cheese.  Loved the sweet and salty combo.  
-Coleslaw:  prepared peppery and vinegary (my faves).  Adds tang to my sandwich...me likes much!  I don't like my coleslaw mayoey (sp?) or creamy ; P.  It also adds bite to the sandwich especially since the 1 inch bread is un-toasted, therefore soft.  

The place is lively with locals.  Staff is friendly and checks in on you while on the go, all the time.  I respect.  

Eat there.  I wouldn't recommend ordering To-Go because the weight and moistness of the goodies flattens/softens the bottom piece of bread quickly.  Even then, the sandwich sits well over 3 inches.  Grub grub grub and enjoy with a sweet tea or a beer.  I'm saving my beer tasting for another place I visited last year.  Review to come soon.

Must go...people are standing at the door waiting for customers to leave.  I can understand their pain; hunger pain that is."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh classic and a must visit.  It doesn't get any better then this.  Huge sandwiches made from delicious bread filled with fries and coleslaw, whats not to love?  And 24 hours!  I crave Primanti's when I'm not in da 'burgh."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Pittsburgh so my friend brought me to a place she considers a Pittsburgh specialty and staple. Let's just say that the sandwiches here are very obnoxious and manly. There are potato fries stickin out with piles of coleslaw. The sandwich isn't bad per se, but not really to my liking. Do not go here on a date. It's messy. 

I don't like fries in my sandwich. I felt like the main seasoning of the sandwich was pepper. However, I did think the choice of thick white bread was interesting."}
{"text":"The Pittsburg one is Great. The Greensburg one is not that good. Little ambiance. Everything is in a foam cup or a greasy piece of wax paper."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. However, when I visited our waitress was a little impatient. Food was delicious, though, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I said the last three times I ate here that I would never be back--basically because the wait staff couldn't care less if you are there or not.  

Consistently, this place's wait staff is the pits!  They do not care to greet you at the table when you first sit down.  We usually wait 10 minutes on a non-busy night for one of them to walk by.  The last time I flagged down who I thought was the floor manager on duty--when I told her that we had been waiting for someone to come over to us for 10 minutes, she didn't apologize or flinch!  The frustrating thing is that it looks as if the girls are all gathered at the window taking to the cooks.  Or maybe they were doing their duties prior to leaving their shift?  NO matter what, they weren't waiting on us!

Good tip:  eat at the bar!  I'm sure they are much more attentive!"}
{"text":"Friend and I dropped by for late lunch around 3pm. Place was full but we were seated surprisingly fast. Once you're seated you're not given any menu since the menu is painted on the walls. Their menu is simple since it's pretty much just various kinds of sandwich fillings (fish, meat, etc.). 

The concept is pretty interesting as well, since they stuff the coleslaw, cheese, tomato, fries, and your choice of meat in between their bread. The portion is just nice, leaving you not too full and not too underfed. 

Would definitely stop by if I were in Pittsburgh again. Remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"We had a pizza. Meh.
A colossal fish sandwich. Ehhh.
A fish sandwich...Ohhh.

Food poisoning. Requests to have food removed from our bill (and our memories), and vows never to return.

Our server was very nice and attentive. It was freezing cold in the restaurant and no matter how hard we tried, we couldn't smell food aromas.

It was roota-to-the-toota GROSS."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food or our server. It is all about the front of the house and the manager. Before I left the house with my family to go to the restaurant, I checked No Wait and the wait was 4-14 minutes for a party of 4. We live 10 minutes from the place so I decided to go \"in line\". I received the text confirmation at 7:21 that I was in line. We arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes later. I checked in at the hostess and she could not find us on No Wait. I should her the text confirmation and her response was \"Sorry, we sometimes lose connection to No Wait because of our WiFi connection and I will add you to the list.\" She also said that she will have the manager talk to us. Now, we are in line behind 6 other parties. I watched as those parties were seated and now it is 7:50 pm. The wait says that we are next in line and there are at least 10 open tables. I went to the hostess stand and she was busy helping out a take out order or something. Finally at 8 pm, I asked a server for the manager. The manager came out a couple of minutes later and I explained the situation since the hostess never went to the manager in the first place. The manager apologized and then sat us at one of the now 15 open tables. She did not offer to compensate us for having to wait an extra 30 minutes. Very disappointed in how this was handled. I guess that I needed to demand to see the manager right away instead of trusting that it will all work out."}
{"text":"Left after waiting an hour for food.  Maybe tell your customers that the kitchen is backed up when they arrive?  A shame, because every other dining experience we have had while visiting Pittsburgh has been really good!  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and ask for Amanda! She is fantastic! Great service and very friendly! Definitely going back to see her!"}
{"text":"Great place for someone like me that doesn't live in the greater Pittsburgh area where Primantis is.  Every time I come to work at the airport, I make a point to eat here.  Good staff , too big but great sandwiches , even the pizza , wings etc are all good.  Also, pretty cheap for food and drink especially if you have the daily specials. No complaints here."}
{"text":"People who complain about this place just don't get it.  They have suburban restaurants which offer an expanded menu and more conventional family restaurant/sports bar vibe.  The Strip location is about history and tradition.  Plates?  Seriously!  As for the food, they tell you exactly what you are going to get and give to you quickly and with a smile.  You either like this kind of food or you don't.  For those who find it bland as served, salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce are readily available."}
{"text":"This place was never as good as history claims it was. Hype is a powerful marketing tool. But now as the culinary world speeds ahead this place is even more out of date. \"We put the fries INSIDE the sandwich!\" Wow. You really knock it out of the park with that one. And while on the subject of knocking, they seem to average a bar fight once a night so be careful. Service was always hit or miss but I've been there twice this month and its gotten much worse. I think I'm done."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good but having fries on them doesn't add any extra flavor and just makes the sandwiches mushy. Clearly it's merely a gimmick thing as opposed to a taste thing."}
{"text":"You know, I showed up because it was recommended on the food network.  The food was good, the fod was different, but I am not overwhelmingly compelled to try it again.  If you are considering going, go.  It is a truely, different dining experience."}
{"text":"Was OK but with all the hype I expected much more.  Very little meat on my sandwich with a whole lot of anything but meat.  OK at best"}
{"text":"I was told if going threw Pittsburgh... And was looking for a place to stop for lunch... That this is the place..."}
{"text":"What a Horrible, Disrespectful.... COLD Experience! 
APPARENTLY NOT 24HRS!!!!
I recently had to take the Greyhound from Cleveland  to Philly due to my flight getting cancelled. I had a 2hr layover in Pittsburgh. I knew, from this city being my second home that Primanti Bros  was not far from here. I had been there many a-times, at late hours over the past 16yrs. I first called asking,  \"walking\" directions from the station..... I was really looking forward to getting some food and being prepared for my long 7hr journey lol.  This was Tuesday, March 4th at 4am..... It was 3 degrees (I was determined. I had also already called mind you) 
When I got there all the chairs were turned up. (never seen that before there) This place advertises 24hrs, dine in!  I was told by the husky red-head I couldn't sit after walking in sub zero temps, that eating in was closed! I even mentioned NICELY that I had called and  walked there! (I got rude hipster sneer \"NO\")
He told me they had a 50 sandwich order and that's why they were \"closed\" (inside) AT 4AM? This restaurant is doing that much business that my cold ass can't sit inside for 25min (at the most!?!?) 
AFTER 16YRS, NEVER NEVER EVER WILL I GIVE THESE SADISTIC A**HOL*S ANY OF MINE,  MY CLIENTS or (with) FRIENDS MY MONEY!!!
I felt I was fed some sort of excuse, and to deny any customer, even if they ordered Cole Slaw is a cowardly, lazy excuse for not wanting to wait on your customers!

When I made it a mile back to the bus station, my sandwich went into the garbage, it was frozen."}
{"text":"This was my first official Pittsburgh foodie experience.

I just moved here and met a friend who was visiting and it was good. I would definitely give it another try. The turkey sandwich I ate was great and I really dug the fries inside the sandwich (although I would have also enjoyed another huge mound on the side to shove into my mouthballs). Now, I normally wouldn't object to slaw in my sandwich either, but something tasted fishy about their slaw ... literally. It tasted like fish. I don't really know how else to describe it.

All aside though, not a bad sandwich and definitely not a bad price either. I feel a little closer to being a burgher, but it still can't beat Rubicon Deli in San Diego. That will always be #1 in my Cali heart."}
{"text":"Lots of hype... No substance....
Hey,  where' the beef...??  No Kidding.... Where's the beef..??

Had their Pastrami sandwhich....  Extra thick cut of Bread... Ok.... Lots of cole slow... Ok... Tons of French fries between 
buns... Ok...  Pastrami..??... About 2 oz of meat at the best....... No kidding.... That's all folks....

You get tons of. \" FLUFF \"  but very little of what the sandwhich is named after...!!!

What a disappointment.... Folks, you get twice more meat in a Subway sandwhich....  All you are getting is Tons of fluff for $7. 

Do yourself a favor... Read some reviews about the some better choices in the same vicinity..."}

We were in this restaurant an hour before we finally got up....and walked out. There seemed to be no management or person in charge and it was very evident. 
*Problems with getting water and tea to the table. 
*Received the big fries with cheese...cold and some seemed cold from being frozen. 
*Observed food sitting on a ledge from the kitchen for long periods. 
*Tried to discuss with server, offered mgr but we never saw any-one. 
*Received more food-various degrees of cold. 
*Told server that we were leaving due to cold food. She said \"okay\".  
*Just literally got up and walked out. 

Customer service-horrible. 
The restaurant seemed to have an inspirational history behind it but somehow, imo, has failed at the customer service level."}
{"text":"Been here off and on for years. Always good to stop in and grab a hot sandwich and fries and a beer. Good place to go after work and hand with friends. Wouldn't take a date here tho, anyone who's taking their girls here today for Valentines Day... shame on you."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating out on the patio for lunch and dinner. Service and food is always consistent. It's a great go-to restaurant/bar if you're undecided."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich! I chose the corned beef one that sounded like something I used to get at a restaurant back home. This one was by far the better option! Fries were not soggy and the slaw was not overly tossed with mayo. Easy to eat and quite filling!
The server I had took the time to walk me though the menu and seemed quite knowledgeable. He was not intrusive but there when needed.  It was a pleasant surprise being in the bar atmosphere. Great job Primanti Bros"}
{"text":"A must eat.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The wait out side was with it.  You have to eat here at least once if you visit Pittsburgh.  Those who do live in Pittsburgh are lucky!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here because of all the rave reviews. This was such a disapointment. The fries were cold. The cheese steak meat was disgusting. Our waitress was completely cracked out of her mind. I feel like I drank a pint of oil. Just oily nasty greasy disgusting."}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from our hotel staff, I took a group of high schoolers here to experience a Pittsburgh tradition. Great bar food-my sandwich was excellent and the kids loved it."}
{"text":"Get into Pittsburgh, go to Primanti's. It's a time-honored tradition, and I know I'm FAR from the only person who does it.  

This is true Pittsburgh. It's real food for the real people of this real city. No flair, no fanciness, no pussyfooting around. You come hungry, you get a great sandwich, and you wash it down with some Iron City beer. Congratulations, you now know what this city's about(well, that and the Steelers). Adam from Man vs. Food had it right, capicola and egg is where it's at, and the fresh fries and slaw really put this place in a league of its own. 

Simply put, you've gotta try this place. It gets on all the \"places to eat before you die\" lists for a reason."}
{"text":"Love this place and so does the internet
Was reading an article this morning,
 about 60 Iconic U.S. Restaurants
you must try before you die and there was
 Primanti's alphabetically listed by state #47
Love the food and atmosphere
Its good to be from Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that this Primanti's location is inferior to the one in the Strip District.  Plain and simple.  It seems as though the cole slaw has a different taste with a bit of a rawer consistency, the portion of fries on each sandwich is smaller, and the bread (Mancini's?) does not seem to be the same as what is used in the Strip.

That being said, the food is still phenomenal.  If you have never had a Primanti's sandwich before, this will certainly not disappoint.  The combination of coleslaw and fries on any of their sandwiches is mouth-watering to say the least.

The service and atmosphere at this location is probably an advantage over the cramped and seemingly unclean location in the Strip District.  The service staff is always friendly and attentive, and you still get the feel of Primanti Brothers here in Moon.

This is a very fun place for any sporting event on any of their many televisions, and they usually have beer specials.

Overall, this is probably my favorite place to eat in Moon, but if I could choose between this location or the one in the Strip District, I would choose the Strip for sure."}
{"text":"After waiting to be seated for about 10 minutes, we were told that the entire dining section was reserved, and it would be a 30 minute wait to be seated in the bar section because, (surprise) it was full.
A suggestion, put a sign on the door to let your potential customers know that half the place is not available today, so we don't stand around waiting to be seated while we watch the wait staff scurrying around waiting on others while we wait to be given the news of the unavailability of your restaurant today.
Thanks"}
{"text":"Awful today. We waited, while we saw many empty tables, and the wait staff scurrying around the restaurant serving customers. After about 10 minutes, we were finally told that the entire dining area was reserved and the bar area is full, so that would a 30 minute wait. We left. May I suggest Primantis, post a notice on your front door, that half the place is unavailable, so I don't have to waste my time to find out the bad news.!!!!
Thank you"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place. Only heard/went there because my dad wanted to.

Great atmosphere. Server was very good. Overall great service. Beer selection was OK. Low price for lots of food.

Had the cheesesteak. It was ok. Nothing special. Like most \"fat sandwiches,\" when you add French Fries to a sandwich, they leave it with little flavor."}
{"text":"I recently had a pastrami sandwich (ordered at the Mt Lebanon location) and it was okay. Not enough meat. I couldn't taste the pastrami. Overrated.
I've had better pastrami sandwiches Fatheads, Szmidt's Old World Deli, Smallman Street Deli. Sorry."}
{"text":"They should be embarrassed.  Cold sandwich but no one to tell and if lucky, saw someone to flag down for basic refill (most gave up).  3 of 5 new pizza plates still dirty with cole slaw remnants is really inexcusable.  Stood up for 10 min to track down bill.  No manager in site. 8 of us at 730 pm on a Monday night.  Restaurant not busy."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I spent a couple of days in Pittsburgh on our way to Western New York (Steelers Fan). We had seen Primanti Brothers on TV many times, on many shows, so we planned on eating there while in town.

A few days before we left on our trip, I decided I wasn't too excited about eating there since fries on a sandwich wasn't too appealing, and it looked a little dry. 

We had decided the night before we left Pittsburgh we might as well give it a shot on our way out of town. Since we weren't sure we'd care for it, we ordered cheese fries and split a pastrami sandwich. I must say, we were pleasantly surprised. I scarfed mine down in about half the time she did. I was tempted to order one for the road.  The bread was moist, the coleslaw had a nice vinegar flavor, and I thought the pastrami was tasty. I will definitely eat there the next time I'm in town.

Note:
The previous night we stopped in the South side location, but it was a fog of smoke. We didn't make it a few steps in before doing an about- face. The 18th Street location was smoke free, at least during lunch."}
{"text":"Great family feeling inside, amazing pittsburgh classic with all the sides piled on a sandwich.  Must stop when in the burgh."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich. Never imagined French fries and Cole slaw INSIDE a sandwich . Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Service is awful as is the food, greasy pizza that still had the texture of cardboard, undercooked fries.  stay away"}
{"text":"You know I don't want to like this place, but I do. However this is not the place for everyone. It is definitely the place to take people when you want them to experience the true nature of Pittsburgh. 

If you don't like eating with your hands, don't go there. If you require your food to be on a plate, don't go there. If you don't like coleslaw or fries, don't order any of the sandwiches.

I don't really recommend the cheese-steak, bec. it's basically a hamburger patty w/ cheese on it. However, I prefer the deli meat sandwiches. And yes the coleslaw and fries come *in* the sandwich. 
I actually like their coleslaw and their fries, though some people I know didn't like either. 

I recommend you follow your meal w/ a chaser of Malox."}
{"text":"I honestly get sick everytime I eat at this place. I don't understand why everyone think it is so good! I got the steak and cheese. First off, it comes on a cold piece of sliced french bread which falls apart so easily. the steak isn't shredded but rather a piece like a hamburger and there is coleslaw on it which is terrrible and the fries on the sandwhich is cold. 
the only good thing were the fries which were hot and delicious."}
{"text":"The concept is great: french fries, cheese, coleslaw and meat. It's similar to a California burrito which is a burrito with french fries in it. How can you go wrong with french fries? Well, a vinegary coleslaw, flavorless bread and soggy french fries will do it. The vinegar overpowers the rest of the sandwich and it is all you can taste. 
I just don't understand what all of the fuss is about. I heard so much about the legendary sandwiches, only to be greatly disappointed. I refuse to give up on french fries in a sandwich, but I do give up on Primanti's. I'm sorry Pittsburgh, please don't hate me."}
{"text":"While on a road trip we decided to stop and stay over in Pittsburgh, PA.  Looking on Google for \"things to do in Pittsburgh\"/\"what to not miss in Pittsburgh\" we saw that Primanti Brothers was on the list, so we decided that we should experience the wonder of the Primanti sandwiches.

Primanti Brothers is open 24 hours a day and has a small parking lot attached for customer parking.  If you get there after 6pm street parking is open, so you should have several options.  The restaurant is a lot of fun to look at.  You can tell it has been around for a long time (80 years).  The walls are covered in framed newspaper articles reviewing the restaurant, pictures of celebrities at the restaurant, and t-shirts that say \"Bite Me...Primanti Brothers.\"  They are a cash only facility, but there is an ATM in the front in case you don't have any cash on you.  The kitchen is open and you can sit in that room or the attached room where the bar is located.  The restaurant can be compared to an old diner or sandwich shop where you can find the menu on a placard on the wall.

All but three of the sandwiches are meat heavy.  If you are not a meat eater then you may choose one of two fish sandwiches, an egg sandwich, or a cheese sandwich.  All sandwiches come with a heaping helping of fries, cole slaw, and tomato piled on top of your sandwich filling choice, and stuffed in between two thick pieces of white bread.

I split a cheese deluxe sandwich with my girlfriend.  She really enjoyed her half of the sandwich, complimenting the cook for getting the greasiness of the fries just perfect.  I was not as pleased with my half.  I enjoyed the cole slaw, it added a bit of tang and tart crispness to a rather dull sandwich.  They were not at all generous with the amount of cheese in the sandwich, the bread was quite tasteless, and the fries were soggy and flavorless.  I added some salt to the fries and that made a world of difference, but I still wasn't a fan.  

I'm glad I went to the restaurant and experienced this Pittsburgh staple but I  could  have skipped it and that would have been fine too.  The sandwich was reasonable priced, so I didn't lose out too much."}
{"text":"Just off the road from a 12 hour trip and it was great to kick back in such a relaxed environment...drinking a beer, watching the game on TV and having a crazy sandwich!"}
{"text":"If you're from Pittsburgh, you better be a fan. Otherwise, prepare to be perpetually ostracized. 

Get the corned beef. Or the pastrami. Hell, everything is good."}
{"text":"no perogies !!!!wth!!!! :( ... this is Pittsburgh right?!? Can't believe it oh well the Capicola sandwich was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Frozen meat patty with a dog food like taste and texture on the P'burgher. Seriously how does this place survive? Read Sarah F. review as it mirrored or experience at the strip district location. Will never return to any location!"}
{"text":"Just as good as strip district original. If you know the history of the sandwich and are a working person,you'll appreciate the giant sandwiches. If you are a sissy tree hugger go eat tofu burger somewhere else. Good food and good service."}
{"text":"I don't usually like coleslaw but this was good. Definitely improved my sandwich.

Little hard to eat given the sandwich size but I was satisfied."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town on our first trip to Pittsburgh for only a couple days. After hearing about how this was a must go to place we decided to check it out. The resteraunt was neat and seemed to have a unique feel to it, but when we got our food it was sub par at best. I chose to get the #2 best seller the pittsburger cheese steak. The bread was regular white texas toast not toasted or anything special. The burger patties were just a frozen patty, again nothing special. The big deal seemed to be that they put fries on the sandwich, which was okay but didn't seem to add anything to the meal. In my opinion this would have been pretty cool (and probably would have tasted a lot better) with fresh meat and Texas TOAST. The price is good, my meal was about $8, but if I had to do it again I would have gone some where else to experience the city."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed at Primanti but extremely disappointed at the Waterfront Primanti. We came on a Monday night - definitely not busy - maybe a dozen customers. Can't understand why we waited forever for 2 sandwiches. Asked the waitress to check on our food. When the food arrived my corn beef sandwich was cold but my husband's was hot. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza Feast, was told fifteen to twenty minutes. I arrived in eighteen minutes so was willing to wait.  Manager came and rang me out, stating it would be a couple more minutes. Then manager can and told me the wrong pizza was made. He said he would have another one made and I could have wrong one. I order pepperoni and sausage on half and extra cheese on whole. Well I received second pizza which had pepperoni on half sausage on quarter of that half and I can't tell you where the extra cheese was, seeing how you could see the sauce even on the just plain side. The Manager was very apologetic but you would think second pizza would be correct. I will still go there, everybody has a bad day."}
{"text":"The good old Pittsburgh mentality of stuffing things and making it bigger until its good said a friend of mine. And yes. These guys do it quite well. 

Primanti's is THE place to go in the Burgh according to many and for good reason too. Any sandwich you get comes with coleslaw and fries with it. No not on the side. IN the sandwich. My personal favorite here is the cheese steak. With some of the hotsauce they have on their table. 
Very good experience in general."}
{"text":"Didn't come even close to living up to the hype. My sandwich didn't come close to looking like the overstuffed monsters that I've seen people eating on TV.  The meat on my #2 best seller was minimal at best, and the waiters kept screwing up the group's orders.  A real disappointment as I was really looking forward.to my meal."}
{"text":"No, don't go.  Its edible, but sloppy and not worth the trouble.

I did not grow up in Pittsburgh, so I have the ability to be honest about this place.  It is a classic Pittsburgh favorite, but no one will admit how bad this place really is."}
{"text":"OK, it's an institution so we ventured to the original Primanti's at a friend's insistence. At 3:30 on a Saturday, we waited for 20 minutes. As for the food: the pastrami was middling, same with the corned beef. The vinegary cole slaw helped add some flavor, but I still doused mine with hot sauce. It's definitely UNIQUE but I doubt I'll ever go again. On the up side, service was quick once we were seated, the beer was cold, food was cheap, the scene was worthwhile. Later, we went to the baseball game, and every other sandwich coming down the aisles was from the PNC Primanti's. Obviously this local eatery has a loyal following. Go ahead and try it. Once."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza to go, which was terrible.  I asked them to cook it more before I left, and when I got home (which is a minute away) it was soggy and gross.  Pizza here is usually good, disappointed, won't be ordering again.  Three stars because hostess that took my order and bartender were great."}
{"text":"The sandwich isn't really that special or good...BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS!

This is a Pittsburgh classic!  A MUST! If you come to Pittsburgh...you go to Primanti Bros and get a Pittsburgh sangwich.

My personal favorite is a cap&egg (Capicola and Egg Sandwich for those of you who aren't familiar with this shining example of sandwich perfection).  They put Capicola, Egg, and just as they do with every other sandwich there, FRENCH FRIES AND COLE SLAW ON FRESH MANCINI'S BREAD. I think hot sauce tops it off but..do what you must to make yours perfect. (I'm telling you though..hot sauce is where it's at. trust me. I'm a Pittsburgher)

Don't know what it is..but this bizarre combo of foods make it an awesome treat and a staple food for Pittsburgh natives.

If you don't get a Primanti Bros sandwich while you are in Pittsburgh...it's like.....going to Oahu, Hawaii and not going to Pearl Harbor...like going to London and not seeing Big Ben....LIKE GOING TO NEW YORK AND NOT SEEING THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. YOU JUST HAVE TO OK?!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try to Primanti's, what with Food Network/Adam Richmand blowing it up and my boyfriend being obsessed with it. I was also scared; scared it would let me down, like another sandwich place with the same concept in Chicago that was gross.

And well: Primanti Bros is better. It was delicious. I had the pastrami and it was wonderful and had nice crispy edges from being fried on the grill. The bread was soft and easy to bite through and the coleslaw was perfection. Coleslaw is my least favorite, unless it's vinegar based and this was vinegar based. It wasn't too vinegar-y and I could tell there was a little something sweet in it. All in all, it paired well with the rest of the sandwich. The fries were crisp and not at all soggy as well. It was marvelous and I could've eaten another one.

Except that I had two huge yuenglings because I was in pennsylvania. you can't get it here, ok?

Also, the guy working the day we went here was SPECTACULAR. Seriously, it was kind of crowded when we got there, then super crowded and he got everybody out within twenty minutes. That's service."}
{"text":"How do you go to San Francisco and NOT have the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl? How do you go to Austin and NOT have barbeque of some type? How do you go to NYC and not have a slice of pizza? You dont! You have to do those things to experience how folks there chow down.
 
    So if in Pittsburgh, you throw caution and your diet to the winds and try a Primant Bros sandwich. In town for a Pittsburgh fottball weekend, (Panthers-ND, Steelers- Bills and even Slippery Rock-Seton Hill) our first stop after the hotel is the famous PB, within walking distance and smack dab on the fringe of Pitt's campus.
    
     Over time Ive learned to trust my inner voice. \"Buy this stock, its a great investment\" or \"Marry her, it'll work out\".  Sometimes I go against it, with rationale like \"eat it, you've had worse\", or  \"so what if I'm husband number five?\"   Well, sitting down at PB's I had a naggin feeling to get the capicola or the pastrami...Not a naggaing feeling, more of a screaming \"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\" vibe going on.. Nice atmosphere, easily navigatable menu,  (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\") a good mix of beers, TV's all around the room.  This is a Pitt landmark, gotta take in the full experience (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\").

      So here's the waiter ,a  fine and friendly fellow and I can hear my mouth and brain arguing. (Mouth: \"Get the number 2, I dont care, I hate this guy anyway from last nights tofu\"..  Brain: \"We're paying for this, jerk, get what you really want\") Mouth wins and I order the hamburger patty with the requisite fries, colesalw, tomatoes and thick sliced Italian bread.  The rationale? Its their #2 seller, after beer!

     The food comes and it only take 2 bites to chastise my brain for not taking charge  (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\"). The coleslaw makes the fries cold, and the hamburger patty well, I'll be kind.  Imagine taking off your shoe, taking out the inner sole, placing it on the grill for 3 minues, them placing it into a  sandwich...Bland, over done, totally buried by everything else in the sandwich. No amount of ketchup could save it..   (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\")   I probably should have just taken it out and eaten a cole slaw/fries sandwich...

Of course while I'm eating, (well enduring is more like it) the sandwich, the next table orders the pastrami....It looked deleicious, hearty, tasteful. My one time to eat at PB's and I choose (like the guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) poorly. I wont slam Primanti Bros with one star because I had alternatives and only one visit. (Note to Brain: Stand up for yourself!. Dont let the Mouth make all the decisions, he only works here, you're supposed to be running the place!..)   

If in Pittsburgh again, I will try PB's again. And I will get, all togther now:  THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!"}
{"text":"Classic spot in Pittsburgh. The other locations don't beat this one. Original is always best. Very nice cook and attentive and sweet server, I got the capicola and cheese. Bread is fresh, fries cooked to perfection. 

Much love primantis :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were kinda hesitant to stop by because my son was with us. We didn't know if he was allowed in. When we got there, we got the best service ever. The server/bartender was so sweet and welcoming. I really love the service, vibe and specially the food. We even ordered to go."}
{"text":"I can't stop coming here! So freaking good.
They're tots are so addicting and the service is so welcoming, friendly and attentive.
My kids love primanti's! !"}
{"text":"If you're going to try Primanti's, then this is the location. Original and iconic, the restaurant perfectly resembles Pittsburgh. Thus, it is very hard to say no to a Primanti's sandwich. I visited here roughly two years while visiting family, and it is authentic PGH. I ordered the original pastrami and every bite was delicious. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I will definitely eat here. I recommend getting here early, as the first time I went was during rush hour(needless to say there was a long line.) Everyone from tourists to Pittsburghers love this place, and that says something. You have to go here!"}
{"text":"Guess I got there on a bad day or it was the cook's day off. Server recommended the classic Primanti. The food was undercooked, cold and greasy. This is the first time I ever remember leaving a restaurant with gut-ache."}
{"text":"Didnt like it. Roast beef was like overcooked steakumms and burger was dry. Staff was okay. Place was on the dirty side."}
{"text":"Made my first visit yesterday. The hostess/register lady was awesome!  Very spunky yet effective at crowd control!  We had a party of 10 and only waited 10 minutes. I got the corned beef and it was great. The fries took away some of the corned beef flavor but overall I enjoyed the sandwich. Will look forward to another visit and tasting another of their creations!"}
{"text":"Lodge like feel when you walk in. Not like your typical Primanti's. there is a big fireplace inside which will be pretty cool for cold season Steeler games. The food tastes the same as the rest of the Primanti's. Smallman street pickles are always the best."}
{"text":"Returned to Pittsburgh, Ate at Primanti a 2nd time:

I stand by my decision: Pass."}
{"text":"The service and food were good. At this location Mon - Fri from 5-7pm is happy hour. Drinks are 1/2 off at the bar...can't beat that deal. I had the \"When Pigs Fly\" sandwich. It was a full meal in itself. There is a lot going on in this sandwich, but all the flavors come together really well. 
The atmosphere was your usual sports bar feel. I liked it, and next time I'm in the area I will come back."}
{"text":"Fast service and clean. I am not a fan of the sandwiches but the rest of the food is good"}
{"text":"This is a no frills 24hr sandwich shop in a recovering part of a formerly blighted town. The sandwiches were good but not great and the table service was simple and completely disposable. It seems that they skimp on meat while loading on all other topping however, this may have just been my sandwich. If your looking for a nice and swanky sit down artisanal sandwich shop this is not it. Also, it is generally crowded and small, and lacking any sort of ambiance. However, it is an honest working class bar with decent food at decent prices. But as a side note the bathrooms are down a long, steep, and narrow flight of stairs."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh staple. Nothing beats a primantis sandwich or their pizza! Always great. Always quick."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sandwich ever.   I usually get the Pitts-Burger, and it has always been fantastic.  And while I've never really been a big fan of cole slaw anywhere else, Primanti's slaw has a delicious, unique taste that perfectly compliments everything on the sandwich.  

There's not a whole lot more to say. The service at this location has always been good, but it's the 5-star sandwiches that will haunt your dreams (in a good way!) and keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Today was the day we finally got to try this place!

I was in the mood for a cheesesteak and the waitress suggested an angus sandwich.  While it was different from a cheesesteak that im used to, it was definitely delicious! However I would get the coleslaw on the side next time.  She suggested a Cajun chicken sandwich for my husband  (because he said he liked a little spice) he absolutely loved it! we washed it all down with a local IPA.
All in all great food, definitely worth the visit-- and great service! Our waitress happened to be from Harrisburg ( that's where we are from!) so we shared some really great conversation!!"}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers makes me regret going out to eat.

Eat here one time, if at all.  The french fries will be mushy and the coleslaw unimpressive.  The only thing this restaurant has going for it is longevity.  

What a mediocre meal.  The waiter would not even look me in the eye.  Perhaps I am alone in expecting quality victuals and service that doesn't make me wish I had just served myself.  If the fries weren't mushy and the coleslaw better than I could get at the grocery store, then this review would be positive.  

Save your money for the high colonic this food will make you wish you had after eating it."}
{"text":"As overrated as it can get.  If you must experience this fixture of Pittsburgh dining, do it one time only.  

The floors are littered with the coleslaw and fries of previous customers.  My server was lackadaisical at  best; I would have preferred to have served myself or just not eaten that night.  

What a colossal waste of calories that could have been spent on fresh bread, hot fries, and decent cole slaw, three things you won't find at this Pittsburgh 'icon'."}
{"text":"A good example of a one-time meal.  Don't let this restaurant fool you twice.  Too much food on the floor; I prefer it on my plate or in my mouth.  The service exists only when you're ready to order and when you receive your food and drinks.  Call me picky, but there's something maddening about eating salty food with an empty water glass."}
{"text":"I've ordered here twice so far. Once for pickup & once through Ubereats. Sandwiches were stellar on both occasions. 

I thought the Smallman Street Fries were pretty gross and I'm typically a fan of loaded fries. I expected chili on them and instead had like 3 kidney beans. I was under the influence of alcohol at that time and won't deduct a star out of fairness. To be drunk and think loaded chili cheese fries were gross must say something though. I'll try them again for good measure. 

Look forward to ordering from here again in the future or stop in for some beer and grub."}
{"text":"The Colossal Fish sandwich is the best fried sandwich in the USA!!!!! I've  eaten fish sandwiches across the nation. THIS IS IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"OK - So I've heard all the hype on TV and seeing as I was staying at a hotel across the street, I decided to give this place go.

A sandwich with the entire contents of the kitchen piled on it makes me want to hurl so I ordered the chicken parm dinner.

It was a good sized portion, but the positives end there.

Chicken breast - WAY overdone! Dry & tough

The tomato sauce on the ziti was passable but not up to what I'd expect from a place with such hype and following. (Shame on you Food TV!)

Note to chef: lay off the black pepper in the sauce!

I didn't get  \"lots of bread and butter\" as indicated on the menu (OK - I'm a carboholic, so shoot me!)

I have one more day left in town. Meals sure as heck won't be here....."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh staple. I have had the original Primanti experience downtown, but the sandwich here was just as great!"}
{"text":"Sure those 5 stars have a little to do with the special place in my heart Primanti's resides in, but hear me now...the food is awesome!! You've just got to know what you're getting yourself into. This isn't for the dainty. 

The sandwiches have french fries on them. That is really all I should have to type here. But I'll elaborate to whip your tastebuds into a frenzy. This Pittsburgh tradition is a must visit and the food is made fresh and depending on where you sit, right in front of your face. The no-nonsense staff is nice but direct, so no fancy substitutions or off the wall requests. Besides the food is perfect the way it is. My #1 is the cheesesteak. Massive and every bite as tasty as the last, it comes complete with tomato, coleslaw, fries and meat. I kick mine up a notch with ketchup but they always have hot sauce around too. One addition people seem to like is an egg on top, whatever floats your boat! 

Every location has its own personality but this one is the original and best if you ask me. Grab a Yuengling  lager to wash it all down, especially if you're from the west cause sadly you won't see it out there."}
{"text":"We have been to Primanti Bros. in Greensburg and in Moon Township.  We like the bigger menu at the suburban locations.  This is our first time to this Primanti Bros.  We went here to eat before a Pirates game on a Saturday.  Parking was not a problem and we were seated right away.  I like gyros and Primantis is pretty good.  The others had a Angus and fish sandwiches (colossal) and they both liked it.  The beer was also good priced.  There is outside seating available too.  This Primanti's is on Route 60 and we were able to get to PNC Park with no problem, so much better than trying to hassle with 376."}
{"text":"Good food and good service!  We came after a baseball game and had the munchies.  We all had one of their signature sandwiches.  We ate at the bar and the bartender was attentive and sweet.  It also doesn't hurt either that they are open till 2am on Saturdays.  We will come again."}
{"text":"After all the hype, as usual, we were hoping for better. Their Pitts-Burgher cheese steak wasn't made of steak; it's a hamburger patty that has a funny taste. The bread was plain ol' thick cut white bread. The fries were greasy & under cooked. Coleslaw was ok, but I'm not usually a fan anyway. The meat on my sister's sandwich (I think she ordered the pastrami) was so paper thin, we couldn't really detect the taste of it when we took a bite. Am I glad I can cross it off my bucket list? Sure. Would I recommend or eat there again? Nope."}
{"text":"I was super excited to finally try this place and was INCREDIBLY disappointed. The slaw was mediocre and the meat was dry and tasteless. The slice of pizza was pretty good but everything else was a big waste of time. Won't be coming back to this place if I'm ever in Pittsburgh again"}
{"text":"We can only go here when out-of-towners come in requesting a visit. Each time I do go, I happily consume the tuna sand (complete with fries and other accoutrements), but I always leave feeling waaaay stuffed and massively guilty, worrying about what I've just done to my arteries. This is not healthy fare, but duh!  It's good tho, just don't be a regular! ;)"}
{"text":"Primantis. A place you go when your out-of-town guests request that you take them there. Then you spend the remaining  time explaining to them that actual great food does exist in the burgh. Still, if it's late and you are trying to soak up the excess of your evening with a bit of French fry grease, this is your place. ;)"}
{"text":"My wife is a native Pittsburgher and we go up couple times a year.  Have never been to any of the chain stores, only the original.  I honestly can't imagine they can match the originality of the store on the Strip.  We always seem to get the same waitress from Lithuania, I think, and she always remembers us even though we are not regulars.
Nothing like a Primanti Bros. sangwich and an IC.  Dang, wish I was there now!!!"}
{"text":"I just had the worst damn pastrami sandwich of my entire life. Primates need to re-name their sandwiches \"potato sandwiches\"...all of them. There was, literally, about two slices of pastrami on this so-called sandwich, along w/ about a half-pound of fries, a half-pound of mediocre cole  slaw, and a tomato slice. All on a couple of slabs of nondescript white bread. Ugh. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"If we could give this location no stars, we would. I'm writing this on behalf of my boyfriend who recently patronized this location and wound up with food poisoning. He ordered a corned beef sandwich and the following morning was violently ill. Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I like/love Primanti's they are what I think of as Pittsburgh food. Even though we have come a long way in the past 10 - 15 years. I still crave the #2 (CheeseStake) and the \"Swimmer\" (Colossal fish sandwich)."}
{"text":"finally had the opportunity to visit the legend.
Sandwich= Pastrami and Cheese. Very Large and delicious...
Service= Left quite a bit to be desired. A friend ordered a drink from the bar and the barmaid was totally clueless. Amazed that they would hire someone like this.
overall a great experience.
GO STEELERS!"}
{"text":"I took my husband to Primanti's Brothers in Oakland for supper on New Year's Day. I guess not the standard day to go to Primanti's but it happened to be when we were in town.  Since the University of Pittsburgh was shut down it was a quiet late afternoon, and quiet in the restaurant. My husband had never experienced Primanti's style sandwiches before and it was a real treat to watch him when our sandwiches arrived.  I had told him what to expect but it was still a lot of fun to see his face when that sandwich, piled high with coleslaw and french fries, was set in front of him.  We enjoyed the sandwiches, the guys working there were really nice, and we had a nice beer too.  Fun times!!"}
{"text":"Super slow service. They have inside and outside seating which is nice. However, they only have two waitresses outside for about 20 tables. They don't take your entire order they only take your drink order and then your good order. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order. After finally getting our drinks she waited another ten minutes to come get our food. When we ordered our food when I asked for light coleslaw she said they can't do that and for me to just take it off. She explained that they just put fistfuls on it. So why can't they just put less fistfuls on it? 


Our waitress was very rude and didn't make me feel welcomed at all. She never introduced herself and just treated us like animals. 

I would never tell anybody to go to the Primanti Brothers again downtown. The one in Oakland is so much nicer and better quality. 

It's really bad management to have only two people serving outside when there are over 20 tables. It's not fair for the customers or for the servers. 

While the food was good as always it wasn't worth the wait because it just took to long. The service wasn't nice at all and I wouldn't tell anybody to come here when it's crowded."}
{"text":"great place for a good sandwich that is unique to Pittsburgh. Price is good beer was cold. A must if going to Pittsburgh. Not saying it is best food ever. Saying it is well worth the experience. Sorta like first philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"It's a decent sandwich that for the money is a very good deal. I had the cappicola. It was a perfect ratio of meat, cheese, fries, tomato and coleslaw. Very filling and decently tasty. This is not fancy food, just hearty sandwiches. Nothing more."}
{"text":"From all that I'd heard about the food here, I was quite disappointed. The best thing about the dinner me n my friend grabbed here was the Blue Moon - which is hard to get wrong. We ordered chilli fries and The Capone. Nothing significant worth mentioning about the fries; the meat in the Tall Boy had a good flavor to it, thankfully. Service was poor as our server was rough and kept practically throwing things onto the table while serving. Wouldn't visit the Market Place spot again."}
{"text":"Was not happy today .  Did anyone ever eat there hamburger s.  ? They are horrible.  Also I got a 4 cut pizza it was not up to par.  Place is overrated.  A true Pittsburgher here...love the concept..but , come on guys step your game up."}
{"text":"This spot was recommended as a \"must have\" when visiting Pittsburgh so I had to try it. First off I must say the Pittsburger was everything it promised to be and I was very happy with my meal. However! The young man that served me was so rude it was appalling! He ignored me as I waited to be seated and only came over when a Caucasian couple came up behind me and even then tried to seat them ahead of me. The lady had to point out that I was there first. Then, I swear if this young man could have thrown my food on the floor to serve me he would've! He literally could not have made me feel any more unwelcome. This is the first time in my life I have ever walked away from a restaurant without tipping and I've had bad service before but tonight I felt like I was treated less than human and that's inexcusable!"}
{"text":"I had never eaten a Primanti's sandwich before coming in here, and although I had some idea what to expect, I wasn't quite sure how well I'd like it. But I was willing to give it a shot.

I am so glad I did. The restaurant was clean and well-staffed, and our waiter, although not real friendly or anything, was polite and efficient. I ordered a Yuengling which came in a huge .5L glass (a surprise to me) and was perfectly cold and fresh.

I ordered my sandwich with spicy Italian sausage. What came out of the kitchen was a thing of beauty. Two slices of soft, fresh Italian bread, with layers of sausage, fries, cole slaw, tomato and raw onion. It was absolutely delicious! It was filling without being really heavy--the fries are not real greasy and the cole slaw is vinegar-based, not doused in mayo.

The flavors of everything in the sandwich work perfectly together, and my pronouncement upon finishing the first half was that this was easily one of the best sandwiches I had ever eaten.

What I also find impressive is that Primanti's is such an institution, they could put out far inferior food and still coast on their reputation, but far from just being some gimmick, the sandwich is actually really tasty.

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The wife and I love Primanti's and we were excited to see one open in Hampton. The service has been great and the few issues we had were addressed immediately. For example, our wings did not appear to be cooked. The issue was taken care of by the manager right away. Another time, there was very little meat on the sandwich and the wings were cold Again, it was taken care of right away. The food is fresh and very tasty. I do understand that every new restaurants will have some flaws but I am optimistic that this place will receive five stars once the kinks are straightened out. I think the food at this Primanti's location is excellent and we look forward to supporting a local franchise business."}
{"text":"Yeah, I tried it. The place was old, dingy, and PACKED! So I was excited. Looked at the menu, this prices were cheap, great first date. So I went for the pastrami,fries,slaw and it was Ehhh ok. The food was fresh bread soft, slaw crunchy, fries piled on, but the pastrami...kind of bland. Maybe I been spoiled to all the pastrami spots in NYC but I was a little underwhelmed. Next in town I will give it another shot, because everything else popped. It was a local spot, near the ballparks, cheap eats, open late. I loved the spot, not the sandwich."}
{"text":"Pirmanti Bros is always on my list of places to visit when I visit Pittsburgh. As one of the staple restaurants when you are in the area and it home of their famous sandwiches. The combination of delicious sandwiches covered with their homemade fries and slaw, make this a great place for lunch or dinner.

If you aren't heading downtown, don't worry, there are many Pirmanti locations around Pittsburgh. Although I definitely would suggest going to this location, definitely has the best inner city vibe around.

Whenever friends or family visit Pittsburgh, they always want to visit Pirmantis and I agree. Check it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful food just like every time i go there. Just remember the online menu is not the same as in restaurant no kids menu either loved it though."}
{"text":"Homemade bread + homemade coleslaw + piles of meat + french fries + tomatoes + my mouf = heaven.

I mean, who doesn't like all that stuff--a meal to go?? 

Do yourself a favor, just go there already. It's the Best Sandwich I've Ever Had. Period."}
{"text":"Primanti's is what it is, a place to take out-of-towners to give them a taste of Pittsburgh food. I'm not impressed with most of their food (the fries have no flavor whatsoever!), but the chili is very good - spicy and tasty. There's nothing special about this location, but at least it's connected to the bar around front, so you can eat your food there and watch the game or socialize."}
{"text":"If the fine folks at Wonder Bread and Jimmy Dean opened up their own landfill, this place might be what you'd expect. Really bad fries. Like a hobo rubbed-up a batch of potatoes with Crisco and said, \"Ta-da!\"

Everyone seems to rave about how it hasn't changed in forever. I'd suggest one. Turn the fryer switch to \"on\"."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches. Could not eat the whole thing. We had the pastrami and corned beef. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The orders don't really allow for a a lot of variety. Its pretty much a meat, cheese, potatoes, tomatoes and slaw. The guys are nice but tell em EXACTLY what you want."}
{"text":"Wonderful service awesome food and great drinks every time I'm downtown I always get wings any flavor and there BLT tots they are so delicious"}
{"text":"This bar IS Pittsburgh.

Notice the mural on the wall as you walk in, the smell of grease from the mounds of fry cut fries and listen to the sizzle of the grill as hundreds of meat laden sanwiches are being carefully combined with coleslaw and fries.

Oh, the pure pittsburgh goodness of a Primanti Brothers sandwich."}
{"text":"I sit here disappointed as my friends enjoy their stuffed sandwiches after I finished a ham and cheese with onion, hold the slaw and tomato. I finished it so quickly because there wasn't much to it. 

Primanti Bros is packed this 4th of July. There is a line out the door for takeout and you need to stand over tables like vultures for a chance at a seat yourself table. Employees are constantly making this announcement about the takeout and table service. It would be wise to put up a sign.

They are significantly understaffed and our poor server is running around like a headless chicken. That's still no excuse for trying to memorize our order and not writing it down. The order for our group of four was so horribly botched. Cheese was added where it was held off, eggs were forgotten, tomato and slaw were held off where they should have been included. One order was completely sent back to be redone and two needed additions. Three out of four if us received waters initially but I didn't receive mine until he came back with the corrected sandwich. I also ordered a pickle that never came.

Oh and the sandwich. I initially thought they held back my meat and cheese. The meat was so thin that I basically had a fry sandwich. I wish I knew the slaw wasn't mayo based or I would have tried it. In any case, it did not live up to the legendary expectations.   

I'd have to say I'm pretty disappointed with my experience."}
{"text":"I had the PITTS-BURGHER CHEESE STEAK.  

What a strange burger.  Stuffed with cheese fries and coleslaw??  Crazy.  The bread didn't really hold it all together well - but it was fresh and tasty on it's own.  Good price.  Decent service.  It was a gorgeous day in Market Square, so the patio was PERFECTION.  

I wouldn't go back for that burger.  I might try something else though.

They had on a 90's satellite radio station.... Jeremy spoke i-iiin claaaas toddaaaaaay.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and use to some of the best food around, including the best deep dish pizza in the USA! I was impressed with the white pizza and wings! Good job guys! Waitresses were attractive, professional, and friendly.....great experience! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"A `Burgh staple. Open 24-hours and cash-only, it's a place to prepare for before entering. French fries on a sandwich is a great idea, and actually comes across tasting great. It's a caloric nightmare, but a heavenly feast. Head there after a game or late night with friends, be prepared for excellent (albeit surly) service, and prepare to have your taste buds overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I haven't been in for a while, but it was every bit as good as it has always been.

I had a ham and egg and cheese sandwich and I had good service a great sandwich and got it out in a hurry.

It was right at dinner time on a busy beautiful fall Saturday after noon, but they were able to keep things moving. I sat at the bar right by the grill as I often do when I have a chance to stop in. It's always fun to watch them prepare everything while you're sitting there.

Some Rockies from out of town came in it was fun to watch them try to figure out what the place is all about! I gave them a little coaching and the guy that waited on and did a great job of explaining how unique the place is."}
{"text":"I've gotta say, I am really unimpressed and very, very surprised.  I've been hearing about this iconic Pittsburgh institution for years, and I was looking forward to checking it out for the first time.  So after waiting in line for 20 minutes or so, I was expecting something special.   It's really not.  

Yes, the sandwich is \"tall\", but it's only because it's stuffed with fries and slaw, and the bread is thick sliced.  If anything, the amount of meat in the sandwich is disappointing.   The best thing is the bread.  But take the fries and slaw out (neither are good), and the whole thing is not even very filling.

The place is very busy at lunchtime and seemed disorganized and understaffed.  You'll never get a drink refill or even a check.  You're lucky if you get served in the first place - the paper-wrapped sandwich unceremoniously deposited at your table - and you'll never see the server again.  

Nothing special.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"Great food, big sandwiches, at great prices!!  If I ever come to Pittsburgh again, this is definitely where I'll stop."}
{"text":"When we asked for silverware the waitress that there were only 5 sets in the entire restaurant.   What?  This place does not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"The original place in the Strip District is the best by far. Capicola & Cheese is my fav and though I'm not a fan of cole slaw, the fact that it's a dry slaw does it for me.  Bring your appetite and leave your attitude at the door."}
{"text":"In town from WV visiting family. My stepmom suggested that we go here. We hoped in the car (St. Pattys' day weekend) and luckily found parking and right around the corner. 3 kids in tow we headed into to a tightly packed restaurant. The host was abrupt wasn't sure if he was seating us or someone else. The table was not clean when were were seated so someone came by after we sat to wipe the table, thus pushing crumbs onto our laps. We were not the only ones they did this to. The waitress came but didn't explain much. My kids ordered applejuice......which we had to send back and get sprite because it tasted horrible. I ordered a steak and cheese. I received the sandwich which was huge but tasted like air. There was no flavoring once so ever. Not even salt or pepper. The experience was gut wrenching as my children, who are not very picky, were very disappointed. When my 3 year old got her food the look on her face was priceless. The fries were greasy, soggy and bland. The cheese was a semi melted heap. The coleslaw left much to be desired. The steak was dry and flavorless, no fried onions or green peppers. I mean that was a steak and cheese right???!?!?!. I had a extra packet of mayo and mustard in my purse and it still didn't help the sandwich. Sorry I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Sports bar meets Italian sandwich shop? I was very disappointed in the food quality as well as the service. My angus beef sandwich (fries on side) was so bland. The bread was soggy. The fries were tasteless and stale. I will not be returning unless I need a hangover cure."}
{"text":"This place is a straight up mom n pop style hole in the wall with murals of sports characters on their walls. The sandwiches here are simply out of this world. When we make our 400 mile drive to Pittsburgh we often contemplate going directly to Primanti Bros first and then to our hotel. 

Service is not overly friendly but not rude either. Their sandwiches are so uniquely good that it is definitely worth...no it is an obligation to come here upon making a trip to Pittsburgh. Their chili is also very good.

In my several years of making our annual 'burgh trip I have never had a bad experience here and have always thoroughly enjoyed the fare. They can expect me back."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting my family,  and was told that I had to get the Pittsburgher. This sandwich did not disappoint! It was a giant sandwich with hamburger patty, LTO, coleslaw, and french fries! This location was cool because it's right downtown in market square with a cool vibe. I would have another Pittsburgher next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I was always proud of this place because of its popularity without having ever tried it.  Being a big Pittsburgh sports fan I knew that this was a highly revered place.  Unfortunately it's not any good.  It'll fill you up at least.  Now they have other franchise locations popping up around my hometown, and I can't fathom why.  I'd go to Chipotle or some other chain if I'm in a pinch for lunch before I'd go here."}
{"text":"Great late night food.  Sandwiches and fries are on point      I would like to think that this is the best spot in Pittsburg unhealthy eating!"}
{"text":"It's one of those \"if you're visiting (fill in the blank city), you have to eat at xyz. Primanti Brothers is where you go for the local fare lunch if you're in Pittsburgh.  Good, unique, memorable but not great."}
{"text":"Do not come here the service is terrible, waited 55 minutes for food, asked the waitress twice went to the boosters and ask for the manager which took 5 minutes Manager came over said he would do something, did nothing, even said it takes 20 minutes to make a pizza. I thought 55 is more than 20. I guess my math is a little off.So we waited an extra 10 minutes to get our order. After we got it the food , it was great.  Obviously we did not realize that Monday evening happy hour was the busiest time of the week."}
{"text":"Random trip to Pittsburgh
Walked over the bridge after Pirates game at beautiful PNC Park
Yelp says better come here
Fully packed, scored an outside table in about 30 min
Eat while everyone checks out the rare site of Asians

If you ever need a last meal in this world, a Primanti Bros sandwich would be a wise choice."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great,  love the open ceilings, covered outdoor seating and the decor is interesting. The food however fell short, I don't understand the hype. The hand cut fries are far from the best, Boardwalk Fries, Smash Buger, Five Guys, etc. all has them beat.  They remind me of trying to make them at home with the wrong equipment, flavorless. Their famous sandwiches also fell short of flavor,  way to much starch when they combine their thick Italian bread and the fries pilled on top your choice of meat. I had the favorite Pitts-burger and was very disappointed, no flavor, the meat was mush and topped with the fries it was gross. The pizza however was good."}
{"text":"Yes, it is touristy.  Yes, it is busy.  Yes, it is unhealthy. Come on folks, you know what you're in for before you even walk through the door.  

Primanti Brothers is an authentic, Pittsburgh experience.  I got the turkey and cheese and my husband got the capicola and cheese. Both sandwiches were absolutely enormous.  I couldn't even finish half of it.

The thing that impressed me the most was the service.  Our server was spot on.  I can't believe how on top of things she was with all the tables she had to serve, wow. 

Tip: try to sit in the balcony so you can watch the kitchen from a bird's-eye view"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to hit this place for a long time. It did not disappoint. Got the capicola and cheese. Fast and friendly service. I guarantee you will not leave hungry. Needed a nap after eating this bad boy. It's a PIT institution.. Worth hitting."}
{"text":"It's always so bomb especially when I'm drunk. It's a real yinzer thing to do. I recommend the capicola w egg & cheese."}
{"text":"For my first impression this place has a very nice location, spacious dining room with some outdoor seating. Yes I went and ordered one of their famous sandwiches but just once again was not that impressed. It tasted more or less a samich of coleslaw and flavorless fries. I don't think the sandwiches are worth it to be quite honest. The special lady had a salad for lunch with which she was not that impressed either. The service was fast and friendly and it did look like they had a large tap beer selection. I'm not sure I would go here to eat what can I say."}
{"text":"Pastrami and cole slaw and fries, oh my! 
I'd heard about all the hype and this place lived up to it.

To have it all piled up into one sando is a midnighter's \"raid the fridge\" dream. A nice combo of pastrami & corned beef, a layer of good cole slaw and topped off with some golden fries makes for one tasty sandwich. Had it been after last call somewhere I'm sure a fried egg on top would have been thrown into the mix.

Couple this with a 23 oz. beer for $2.50 and what more could you ask for. Actually only minus 1/2 star because of their chili, other than that, scarf up people."}
{"text":"Late night hot spot! Full bar + amazing Pittsburgh classics, was recommended to me by a native born and raised on my first trip there, now I go every time after hitting the bars. The burgers are strange (to this SF kid) Coleslaw, fries, and a burger with a almost meatloaf consistency, oozy cheese, and downright delicious!! The fries are great as is the chili. Had to try the hotdog sandwich as well, so good. Of course not super high quality ingredients but that's not what you're looking for coming into this place. Especially if it's your first time in Pittsburgh you gotta go!"}
{"text":"As a Pittsburgh institution, it is unfortunate that the food here is just OK.

The sandwich composition is excellent in concept, a bit flawed in practice.  The bread is a pretty plain italian that gets soggy quickly, lacks flavor, and will quickly disintegrate when you try to man handle the massive sandwich into your mouth.  The fries while plentiful seem somewhat undercooked, soggy, and are always painfully under seasoned, which results in a huge dead mass in the center of the sandwich that doesn't add flavor or texture.  I've had a few different selections of meats, and they are almost always overcooked. The cole slaw is pretty yummy and probably the best part of the whole thing because of the vinegary snap that it gives.

You could definitely execute this sandwich much better yourself than they do here."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty good.  Is it gourmet, life changing food? No, but i enjoyed it, and thought the concept actually worked pretty well.  The whole (the sandwich) was greater than the sum of its parts.  By the standards of \"IF YOU GO TO PITTSBURGH, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS,\" it's probably more like a 4 star, but I thought it was good, and even stopped near the airport for another one when i was on my way out of town.  And it's reasonably priced for a nationally famous place too.

I had the pastrami and corned beef, and also recommend the double meat option"}
{"text":"I have the steak sandwich when I wind up there. service can be spotty at times depending on how busy they are. over all not bad."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would, we stopped for a late lunch and we were ignored for 20 minutes, no one even came over to greet us, after several staff members came by and didn't even acknowledge us. the place was dead barely any customers so it wasn't like they were slammed, so after being ignored we left and got fast service at a restaurant up the road, as a result of this we will not be going back to primantis"}
{"text":"I always enjoy Primanti's, but I suppose one must accept slow service from time to time to get great food.  Despite a lull in patronage (between lunch and dinner), it took unbearably long for the food to arrive - allegedly because of \"prepping the pulled pork\".   Then there was the long wait for the high chair, the check, processing the payment, and finally the container for the leftovers.  You may interpret my rating as an average of a solid \"5\" for the food and a generous \"3\" for the lackluster service."}
{"text":"pretty decent pastrami sandwich.  It's a traditional Pittsburg favorite."}
{"text":"I think their sandwiches are just okay. They don't have enough meat on them but a ton of fries and Cole slaw. A little more meat and they would be a lot better. As for their #2 best seller. Dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"I knew that once we hit Pittsburgh, we HAD to try Primanti Bros. Everybody AND their bro had been raving about it and I just had to give it a taste for myself. 

Unfortunately...my taste did me no great feat. I ordered the Capicola and Cheese from a waitress who would have rather thrown a sandwich in my face than take my order...no joke: service=terrible. HOWEVER, I was willing to give them a pass seeing as it was the day of a Steelers home game and that place was PACKKKKED. (I've done my fair share of service work and I know days like that can be a real bitch) Moving along...after I ordered for myself and my handsome ginger sidekick, I was oozing with excitement to get my butt in a seat and chow down on this sandwich I had heard about all weekend! 

Fast Forward THIRTY. MINUTES. LATER. We get our food.

Ok, I get it, your busy. But let me reiterate here: FOUR tables were served before we were. And we only got two sandwiches. Insert pissed emoji here. 

So, after all was said and done, my sandwich was just ok. Nothing to write home about. The service blew it for me. And I was so pumped too. Damn."}
{"text":"Fried pickles are amazing. Fries are fantastic, Sandwich is the most overrated food item I think I have ever had. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad by any means. It is just a very average sandwich imo. This place probably has the best happy hour deals too"}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is the local hype. The sandwiches lack flavor, it's just another one of those places you have to try once to say you did."}
{"text":"Great Sandwich. I like bread.  The sandwiches are made of extra thick cut slices of bread and come with awesome coleslaw and fresh cut fries in them.  I had the knotwurst sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Should have ordered the 23oz draft though.  My colleague could not handle the size of the sandwich though - a lightweight!  We came for lunch and will go back!"}
{"text":"We came to town for a Steelers game and were accosted with demands to go to Primantis. So we went to the original figuring it had to be the best. The divey decor was expected and cool. The beer (ICB) was fine.
We ordered traditional sandwich. It was meh! The meat was good the cole slaw was ok and the fries smashed into the mix were cold. Maybe that's the original recipe and I'm a jerk for saying it, but it sucked."}
{"text":"Well, gotta try it when in Pittsburgh! We tried different locations.... the first time I tired the giant sandwich, I was disappointed. Then I gave it another shot and tried a different sandwich, It was good. So the 3rd time, I had chicken wings and some other forgettable thing. I liked the wings for sure and our friends liked their orders as well. So it's a 2 because its messy but one of a kind.  Sometimes good, other times not so good. But What is the deal with the fries?!? Nobody eats that way! You have to remove it before attempting a bite. It's not even tasty. Oy."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a sammich and an Iron City. Cash only BTW."}
{"text":"Really 3.5, but I'll round up for this one.  I had to stop here, right?  It's a Pittsburgh institution.

So.... the fries and slaw are on the sandwich, huh?  Big deal.  It seemed less like a distinguishing gimmick, and more like a move to avoid giving you a plate.  It was just easier throw everything in the sandwich, wrap it up and give it to you.... and it caught on.  Now it's a big deal, I guess. 

But, I'm not trying to be negative here.  Bottom line is that I enjoyed my pastrami sandwich.  If I ever go again, I think I'd throw a fried egg on there too.  It seems like the perfect place to grab a quick sandwich before heading to a game.  If I lived here, I'd probably develop an unhealthy obsession with this place, and come here way more often than my cardiologist would want me to.

Recommend."}
{"text":"Heart and soul of Pittsburgh! You won't get sandwiches like this anywhere else! My personal favorite sandwich is the Colossal Fish and I promise that you will not be disappointed with everything on their menu! I also like getting cheese fries on the side since your fries come on the sandwich."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in the area. Half off drinks and like 1.50 slices of pizza. Always a good time."}
{"text":"Sorry Pittsburgh, I don't get it. After a long wait we finally got our \"famous\" sandwich. It's was, hands down, one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had. It was basically a coleslaw sandwich on trailer trash while bread. The meat (pastrami) was paper thin and the fries were soggy, cold, and basically uncooked. 

Word of advice - skip it!!! I'd recommend Fat Heads. At least you get something tasty there and great beers to boot"}
{"text":"I guess some people love there sandwiches but for me and the people we were with they weren't that great. Wouldn't go back there. But the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted to experience some Pittsburgh-only offerings. Your entire party has to be present to be seated. We ended up sitting at the bar and handed menus. I ordered the Pastrami and Cheese - my friends had the Philly steak and the Angus Beef sandwich. You get your meat, cheese, coleslaw, and fries mushed in between two thick pieces of bread with some tomato as well. The sandwich was honking huge but after smashing it down, I was able to inhale the sandwich. The pastrami was delicious! The meat tender and the coleslaw had a great kick of vinegar. I think this place is more about an experience especially in the Strip District and I loved every minute of it."}
{"text":"We drive all the way from the DC area for these sandwiches, love them! Try the chili fries and tater tots very tasty as well."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple! Highly recommend to out-of-towners & Pittsburghers alike. Add hot sauce! It's amazing! I wish they would put one in the Pittsburgh Airport!"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh tradition like no other. Unhealthy food served on wax paper... Gotta have it twice a year!"}
{"text":"I am a Pittsburgh native.  Trust me when I say, \"If you are anywhere in Pittsburgh or it's vicinity, you HAVE TO EAT AT PRIMANTI BROS!  There, I said it. Great BREAD plus MEAT, plus FRIES, plus COLESLAW all on ONE FABULOUS SANDWICH!  Kids, there is no muss or fuss here.  Order, then they bring your sandwich on a white piece of tissue.  No plate, no silverware, no tablecloth.  Just open your mouth and stuff in that sandwich and you will be a \"LIFER\" like me!  OMG, every time I make a trip to Pittsburgh, I have to have it!  ADDICTION!  Primanti Bros--you need to franchise nationwide!  I now go to the Monroeville location because it's right near my Mom's house, but any location around the Greater Pittsburgh area will do just fine."}
{"text":"As soon as I booked my trip to Pittsburgh, I knew I had to get to Primanti Brothers for their legendary loaded sandwiches. We waited on a Saturday for only 5 minutes and our orders were immediately taken. I ordered the pastrami sandwich and about 5 minutes later it arrived at our table. It was salty and delicious with the fries and slaw on this large sandwich. The slaw was my favorite part. I could have eaten a large bowl of just the slaw. The only critique I have of Primanti Brothers is that their fries could stand to be a bit saltier. Other than that this is a great establishment with quick service. Just remember its cash only!"}
{"text":"I am from Pittsburgh and this is just the burgh wrapped in wax paper.  It is always delish and something you need to do when you visit the town.  John Stewart, Obama, and Gore all go there when in town plus many many more."}
{"text":"tourist grease trap.  This is the epitome of classic Pittsburghese food and it is nasty.  Just the grossest pile of low quality meat smothered in soggy fries and disappointing cabbage slaw on a bun soaked in so much grease that it disintegrates while you eat it.  The floors, walls, and ceiling are caked in grease and all of the employees need to shower and shave.  And no matter what time of day you are there, ESPN is on a flatscreen on every wall, further reinforcing the trashy vibe."}
{"text":"This is the most overrated place bragged about in Pittsburgh. My first visit was to the one in South Hills. Waited 90 mins for 4 sandwiches. The coleslaw is gross and I'm a fan of coleslaw. Due to the 90 min wait I was given a gift card which I used at the one in Market Square. This time I got the grilled chicken salad. If you like chewing on rubber bands, I recommend it. It was the absolute worst salad I've ever had, how can you screw up a salad? The chicken was tasteless and rubbery. Got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when I picked it up. She assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food. I told her I was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word. I will NEVER go back to any of these locations. I'd rather eat a ham sandwich from Sheetz. At least I can get that without an attitude. If you have friends coming to visit from out of town, take them anywhere but here. And for those who say you have to go to the original one in the Strip, no thanks, it's the same food. If you are looking for an awesome sandwich go to Schmitz Old World Deli in Greenfield."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for a steelers game, we headed out to find late night dining and this place said they were open until 3am- perfect for us. We visited the location near Pitts campus and thankfully we made it in before the students came back for the semester. 
The only NEGATIVE we had about the place was it was so cold I didn't even want to stay for another round of drinks.
Because we were there before the busy season there was only one other table there and the wait staff was very attentive to us. She was super friendly and gave us the run down on how the sandwiches are made.
I wasn't that hungry to get a full sandwich so I settled for the terror tots, delicious!! For some they would probably be too 'hot' but for me, the spicier the better!
Another thing I loved about this place was their draft beers came in 2 different sizes!
Will definitely return the next time we are back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Just writing a review makes my mouth water. I've only been once but I got one of the well-known pastrami sandwiches loaded with fries and cole slaw. It's huge, and if you're a snobby chick that refuses to eat like a man then don't even bother visiting. This place is seriously cool and it's featured on the Food Network, which is a big deal to a food dork like me."}
{"text":"We went here while in Pittsburgh for a wedding, and knew about the place from friends who grew up there.  In preparation we watched the Pittsburgh Man vs Food ep, and were pretty psyched to go.  This is no Grease Trucks in New Jersey.  

My sandwich had barely one piece of a sausage on it.  Barely.  It did have an enormous pile of not-crispy fries and cole slaw (the vinegar kind). 

Terrible, what a complete let down after hearing about it (seeing it on tv).  Perhaps it's just hit or miss?  

Some of our fellow wedding go-ers had different experience, those from Pittsburgh managed to have meat filled sandwiches, those of us not from Pittsburgh had fry sandwiches. 

Do I need to wear a Pen's cap or something? 

Also to note- we went to the market square location, not the original. Maybe this influences it?"}
{"text":"Visiting in town for the Steelers/ Browns game. Was advised of this place from a coworker native of Pitts. What a great place to try for an out of towner. Atmosphere was hype due to pennstate playing,  service was superb, and food was delish."}
{"text":"Didn't love it. Noisy, greasy, ridiculously unhealthy and you need to pay cash."}
{"text":"We played tourists today and stopped in at Primanti Bros. Hubby and I saw the episode of Man Vs. Food, just like everyone else in the joint. I was hesitant about getting a sandwich, but decided on the corned beef and cheese (with tomato, coleslaw and a handful of fries). The meat was lean and delicious! Overall the sandwich was pretty good. The hubs got the Pittsburger with an egg. Meat was moist and flavorful and cooked to a medium doneness.
I would've rated it higher, but we had to ask twice for a highchair. Also, the seating was a bit confusing. When we entered, there was a group of customers scurrying for the door and the tables. I think that you're supposed to seat yourself, we did."}
{"text":"The atmosphere,  the sandwich, very enjoyable.  Had the pastrami and was leary about having coleslaw on the sandwich but it works. Add a little hot sauce and it is perfect."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong, I know that this place is an icon in Pittsburgh. But I've just never been a big fan of coleslaw, so most of the appeal is lost on me. I have tried the sandwiches though, which were good. They just did not blow my socks off, which is why I gave it 3 stars. They have pretty good service, and it's fairly priced. I do recommend the cheese fries after a night out on the town - great way to end the night. Overall, it's average in my book."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Pittsburgh and this place came highly recommended by friends that live in Pittsburgh. While the service (people could not have been more hospitable), the food was disappointing. 

The idea of the fries on a sandwich sounds like a great idea in theory, but in actuality it is not. I ordered the Salami with a fried egg on top. The sandwich despite all of these things on it was extremely bland. You need about a pound of salt to get any flavor out of it......"}
{"text":"It was O.K. I stopped here on my way from Maryland, for business.  Thanks to my Yelpers, I thought I would check this place out.  I had the egg and cheese and my guest had the corn beef.  It was an average sandwhich, nothing spectacular.  I like the thick white bread!  my review and experience is about as exciting as my sandwhich and the service."}
{"text":"No matter what season, this Pittsburgh institution always satisfies.  If you are a fan of any other team than one based in Pittsburgh, don't be surprised by the fan fever.  Enough locations around the area to get a bite without the lines."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while passing through Pittsburgh without knowing anything about the city or this establishment. Like gnats, we were attracted to Primati because their neon sign was... pretty.... soooooo pretty!

Anyway, stopped in here and order the Pittsburgh cheesesteak which was quite tasty. We also got the Cajun chicken sandwich with cheese... because everything there comes with cheese. Everything. Need salt? Even that has cheese on it. It's kinda awesome.

Anyway, both sandwiches were quite tasty and with the fries on top... yummy.  Would definitely come back here next time I'm coming through Pittsburgh, hopefully for longer than a few hours."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here last night and mmmmm mmmm mmmm was it the bomb dignity! I got chili and a greek salad, fresh homemade dressing was great! The chili was original and tasty! The hub ordered a pastrami sandwich, he's what I call a pastrami conniseaur ... He thought it was amazing which says a lot! The sandwich was huge! He also got chili cheese fries... He didn't like the type of chili they had on it it wasn't thick enough but they were good! If your in town def worth the try"}
{"text":"There is nothing more Pittsburgh than Primanti's.  Even better than the food are the prices.  It's rare to get a staple food of an area at this price level.  For anyone visiting a stop is almost a necessity."}
{"text":"My friends were really excited to take me here after a night out. We had tried to go earlier in the day, but the line was too long.

We arrived and at 2am, the place was still packed - always a good sign. We found a place to sit and ordered. We asked if we could order seperately and the waiter said to just order all at once and we could figure it out later. I asked if I could have no Coleslaw (most coleslaw has vinegar in it which makes me sick) and was told that I would have to take it off the sandwich myself. I understand its a tradition, so I won't get too sour about this, but I wasnt super thrilled about this.

Our food finally came and the waiter was a jerk to my friend when she asked for extra forks. We asked what the totals were and he said we had to pay all together. We had previously asked about this and been told it was fine to do it seperately, but that wasn't an option now. Instead of taking all the time to figure out what we owed (there was no bill) I just paid so we could catch our cab home.

Now on to the food. Awesome. It was quite delicious. I understand why my friends took me there... I inhaled my sandwich and was ready for another one. Def worth the bad attitude wait staff.

All in all, the food was five stars but the service was not. Its not a sandwich you want to miss out on, but don't go when they are busy."}
{"text":"It's very sad if this place is the \"Iconic\" restaurant Pittsburgh is known for. Not a place to go and find great food. Perhaps a place for Steeler fans to drown their sorrows after a good beat down. Not sure how this place has survived... At least the beer is cold.
The food is just BLAH! No unique taste at all with these sandwiches. Everything is served on the same boring French bread, with your choice of meat. The slaw and fries on the sandwich does nothing. Actually, I think it makes it more of a dry sandwich. 
Maybe folks from Pittsburgh don't really care about taste. 
Service was okay!"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh to see the Pirates. Ah memories, just like long ago when I used to frequent the strip district location late at night and they would only serve you a cheese steak, they would not put Swiss cheese on my brothers salad vice cheddar even though they have it on hand and he got to eat with a plastic fork. My wife and I got the pastrami sandwich, it was good, just the same as always. Service has never been a strong suit, some things do not change. My brother did say service is more responsive in suburban locations."}
{"text":"I have always preferred this location over all the others! I took my family here on the fourth and they fell in love with it too! The food, atmosphere, and service is amazing. As always there was a bit of a line, but we were seated pretty quickly. You definitely feel like family when you walk in. You definitely need to try the Pitts-Burger and the Stanwix St. Fries!"}
{"text":"We were divided on this place.  I thought it was ok, Christina thought it was great.  Quick and friendly service, resonably priced.   Would give it a second try."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place and even went to a copycat restaurant in SF where I live.  But the original was sooo much better.   Great prices and great food.   I'm so glad I went to the original."}
{"text":"I admit that I bring NYC sandwich snobbery to this review. Problem is, you can't get a decent sandwich in Pittsburgh. Primanti's is no exception. Fries and cole slaw are side dishes and don't belong on a sandwich. Primanti's bread is cut too thick and there is a minimum of meat and cheese and the quality of the meat and cheese just isn't that good. Their cheesesteak bears no resemblance to anything found in Philadelphia which adds Philly snobbery to my review. The meat in the Primanti version more closely resembles a thin flavorless hamburger patty. 

The bar is ok and the pizza is surprisingly good. But the sandwiches...puke."}
{"text":"Totally cool place! Very comfortable and nothing fancy. It's a great place for anyone but it's especially a great place for a steelers fan! And the sandwich's are totally worth it. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Definitely something that you have to try when you visit Pittsburgh.  Whatever you order, it will be a greaseball.  Ketchup and red devil hot sauce made my sandwich pretty tasty, but I think for that much grease, it should have been phenomenal, not just pretty good."}
{"text":"If you are in Pittsburgh, you must visit Primanti Brothers.  We trekked to the original location in the Strip district to grab one of their famous sandwiches.

The original location looks like a bar but when you walk-in it looks like a takeout counter.  I ordered the Angus steak sandwich to share with my parents.  When our sandwich came out, it was gigantic.  Not sure, how one person could eat of it, but I guess American stomaches are bigger than Canadians.  Overall, the sandwich was ok, the hand-cut fries are a nice touch and I liked the coleslaw in the sandwich.  It was messy.  The steak was hidden with all the other toppings in the sandwich.

This place is worth checking out if you are in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers was better as a myth than as reality.  Dont get me wrong the atmosphere was great for a pre-Steeler game warm up but the food did not deliver.  
The wait was about 20 minutes and we were starving by the time were greeted with \"drinks!?\" by our sweaty and surly waitress.  I ordered what is claimed on their menu to be the #2 best seller, the cheese steak sandwich.  We settled in and enjoyed a couple cold Yeunglings and watched sandwiches get thrown together by some guy who didnt even look like he worked there.
Our waitress never came back to get us another beer but when she dropped off our sandwiches I was appaled to see my cheese steak was a compressed pattie of tough flavorless meat.  I had to grab the waitress as she ran by and get her to examine it.  She assured me it was their #2 bestseller.  It was horrible and the Chili was watery.  I can say that the Pastrami was okay so there.  All in all it was definitely one of those places you have to go at least once and probably just once."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good 
Service was good
However if you are looking for a Philly cheesesteak you're in for a surprise. It's nothing like. Keep an open mind and you might be pleasantly surprised. If you want a tradition untraditionally made ask for the Sicilian cheesesteak sandwich and again keep an open mind. I would go again."}
{"text":"The chili is good. The pizza is okay.  Sandwiches are okay without the fries and slaw.  Like the two on the side.  I know it's a Pittsburgh thing and I'm from here but I don't like all the stuff on the sandwich."}
{"text":"Who would think about adding fries in a sandwich!!!

You had me at fries, but their sandwiches are much more than that!! It even has cole slaw!!
The best and filling sandwich you can ever find."}
{"text":"Deliciously messy. Awesome coleslaw. I got the true Pittsburgh eatery experience!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Pittsburgh close to the PPG Building Complex,this restaurant has a special Blue Collar charm.I had a fine supper for a reasonable price at this restaurant.I ordered a huge Pittsburgh-Style Fish Sandwich on Italian Bread with French Fries and Cole Slaw mixed in.The service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was excited about all of the hype. The flavors weren't there for me. The bread was really fresh, probably my favorite part.

I wouldn't get it again.

The staff were all awesome (kind, friendly)."}
{"text":"They have Primantis in FL but I decided to try the original in Pittsburgh, PA since I was on my way to the state of IL for a job contract. This is truly a historic landmark where the flavors of its 100 year existence is instilled in its Flat Iron grill. I had the Pastrami sandwich and it was well worth it.  True difference in flavor compared to their location in FL. Loved every bite. I can cross this out of my list of places I've been to in my lifetime in my travels being a foodie"}
{"text":"UGH! --Bland food...

After hearing about this cool sandwich shop in the Strip District, my friend and I headed here with a ravenous appetite.  We entered the pub style place and were looking forward to some good food.  Our server was great. She was attentive and on the ball, but the food was awful.  We both ordered sandwiches with the fries \"not in them\".  We got our goods and had a very hard time finding any meat in the mound or coleslaw.  We then realized why they put fries in the sandwich..to make you feel full and nothing more.   The sandwiches were lifeless and fries on the side soggy.   We opted for the loaded fries and they said \"bacon\" with cheese and chili on top, but they were actually Bacon Bits! Little hard crunchy, meatless crisps!  Awful food here and we couldn't get out of there fast enough.  Cheers to our nice server though!"}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers, especially the Oakland location, never disappoints. But the first word of warning, don't come here if you don't like coleslaw or tomato on your sandwiches. It seems obvious but their sandwiches need the slaw/fries/tomato to make them special. Bonus points for adding onion and fried egg.

I usually skip the #2 bestseller and go for the strip steak sandwich instead. A couple bucks more but a much better steak sandwich. No sides necessary as the sandwich is filling enough - at least for me.

For the tourists out there, I can't imagine most of you will \"love\" these sandwiches. It's sort of in our DNA as a Pittsburgher.

Surprisingly the pizza available at some of the suburban versions is pretty good itself. They always have some sort of beer special as well."}
{"text":"Service was almost none with me being alone. Slow & could never get a refill on ice tea. Sandwich was above average but I had to choke down the last of it dry without any refill on drink. Could never find the waitress??"}
{"text":"This seemed like a must do for the Pittsburgh experience. I thought it was a bit of an acquired taste for an out of towner.  Its worth a try though.  Parking seemed like it can be challenging."}
{"text":"What looks more like a Boston pub, this corner sandwich bar sits like a gathering hole for Zeus: locals weaving stories, food fit for gods, and ladies serving with magic. 

I entered and it was clear on this weekday that I was an out of towner. Lost and staring at the board, the locals bellowed \"foeget tha... Set don heer at the baar\". Immediately, a lady at the bar welcomed me with \"first time? Where you from\". 

Immediately, the fun began as she spun tales of who likes what, what she likes, what not to do, and then she dropped the boom when I asked about the Cole slaw and mayo: \"no mayo here and you are doing it with our slaw. Not an option. We will swap it if you don't fall in love\". Another lady said, \" camon Chicago, we ain't lettin you not do slaw\" 

So I did.

My Choices
1) Turkey and Cheese with Bacon added (server rec on bacon)
--- the turkey is fresh and melts in your mouth. It is comparable to a Chicago Jewish deli 
--- the bread is fresh and flavorful but meant to compliment not dominate. 
--- the difference maker is the perfect ratio of cheese, slaw, tomatoes, and fries. She was right! The slaw is killer as a salt and vinegar. With the fries piled high on there, yes that is part of it, you can't go wrong. I was blown away
--- the bacon was delicious and a great addition. She said an egg is the killer topper and I should have added it
2) Cheese Sandwich with egg added (server rec on egg)
--- same as above but the cheese blend of four works perfectly. I would have liked it melted more but this isn't a grilled cheese. 
--- wouldn't get this again not because it wasn't delicious but it isn't comparable to what is possible with the others
--- PERFECT for kids!!! One and split
--- egg was a definite quality addition done medium without asking 

Others
I didn't get anything else as that was more than enough. I ate 1/2 of each. Locals said brisket or hot sausage are the stuff!

Tips
1) listen to them!
2) keep slaw
3) if you are new, tell them and then listen to them!

The conversations, stories, and food will bring me back. They took me under their wings and spent well over an hour spinning with me. Pirates vs Cubs, Pitt vs ND, pirates vs Cubs, food, fitness, and food.

And then, they brought me free doughnuts from next door! Awesome place and spirit!

Go there. Live amongst the gods!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after living in pittsburgh for a year; wondering what all the hype was about. I ordered the Pitts Burgher and ate half of it and half of a Corned Beef...and also, split the Small mans st fries. The fries were pretty good; however, the sandwiches were just ok. The fries in the sandwiches were bland, the hot sauce on the table was not hot at all and there was a fly of some sort stuck on the straw of the cup of soda. Obviously, it had been floating previously inside the beverage. So, someone please inform me about all the hype..because I don't see it."}
{"text":"I decided to give it another try.  I went to this one in Pleasant Hills versus the one I went to for the first time in the Strip. This environment was more appealing to the eye. The sandwiches were still ok. I'm willing to try one more time ..sometime in the future. I want to try the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. Hopefully it's not \"just ok\".."}
{"text":"All I heard when I first moved to Pittsburgh is how GREAT Primanti brothers is. Well I have eaten and two locations and they have the worst sandwiches I have eaten. EVER!
While no one can deny that french fries on a sandwich is awesome, I think we can all agree that the stale non-toasted bread and runny coleslaw make this sandwich taste like I am eating ass. 
Primanti brothers is a Pittsburgh staple, and Pittsburghers love \"their\" stuff, but  this is one place they should let die out."}
{"text":"Great place, a must go if you're in Pittsburgh. The service was lacking, but the sandwich was amazing. Fries and slaw on everything!"}
{"text":"my friends at Pittsburgh said that it must a try! that was I went there! I had an steak sandwich, greasy but delicious and with the fries and slaw are on the sandwich! which was strange! It was not easy to eat it, but it was fun! apparently pitts folks really love fries :)"}
{"text":"The service was ok. I ordered the Sicilian cheesesteak and there was very little meat. It was more like a tomato sandwich. The fries were a bit cold. My daughter ordered the chicken club and the bacon was chewy and undercooked and the chicken had no flavor. The positive was the terror tots. Those were very good. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"O.m.g. I just ate the WORST Wings in my life!!!!!!
The must have Reheated them in the microwave because they were BURNT from the inside!!!!
This was a First, eating Crap food there. Fire the cook or manager!!!!"}
{"text":"You can't go to the 'burgh without getting one of these, legendary for clogging arteries and late night tv appearances. Veggies don't fear, they can satisfy you as well. Very fun spot."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to enjoy the famous primanti bros sandwich. Have seen it featured on various food network shows over the years and added to my list.   Well it definitely lived up to the hype.   All the sandwiches are made the same way: coleslaw, tomato and fries added on top of your choice of meat.  The bread is a thick cut but soft white Italian bread.  I opted for the Cajun chicken.  
This was a solid sandwich. What I loved about the coleslaw is that it was oil and vinegar based. The flavor blended nicely with the fries and spicy chicken.  Needless to say, three were no leftovers.   Will definitely be back when traveling through the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"This restaurant remodeled part of the dining room..  more booths were added in the area where the pool table used to be.    
Also, noticed the menu has some new items.  A variety of tater tots have been added to the menu.   Retro, BLT and Terror Tots. (Fun dipping sauce, bacon, hot) I cant wait to go back and try one of those.  The sandwich \"The Capone\" has to be a newer item.  
If you are a lover of Italian meats - this sandwich is for you.   Super flavorful - very filling. Enough to split - no doubt.  Interesting wing flavors.. however: why no buffalo hot?  There was only chipotle and xx hot ?     I love hot and spicy food and ordered the xxhot - they were hot but meh .. I wish there was a regular hot flavor in the wing selection - not just regular buffalo to extreme.    Overall great positive changes to this location.. thanks Primantis ..cant wait to return!!"}
{"text":"The best Primanti Brothers around.. well besides the original of course.. 
The service behind the bar is outstanding.   I have visited the restaurant many times and they knock it out of the park every time..


Totally recommend visiting this location especially for happy hour.. one of the best happy hours around.

Oh and many don't know this but their pizza is out of this world! Try it if you haven't all ready.."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Pittsburgh I have to stop here. I've ordered a few sandwiches but just like everyone says... Everything is good! Only down side is that service is a little slow."}
{"text":"Great food. Had a minor issue, but the manager on duty, shawn, helped us and everything was excellent. Definitely be back because of him."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and I read this was one of the places we had to go. We hit them up for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and it was packed. We were able to find a table quickly and were served our drinks quickly as well as our sandwiches. We both ordered the Cheesesteak, which was good. They serve it with fries and coleslaw on it which was very interesting, but made for a tasty sandwich. Enjoyed that it was a real coleslaw and not covered in mayo. It was an experience, and we may go back on one of our next visits to try something else."}
{"text":"REAL TASTE OF THE BURG - A WORKING MANS SAMMY!

This is classically Pittsburgh! I delicious load of corned beef with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, a savory slaw and fries all in one! Only wimps and ladies need this sammy cut in two! 

Formerly an all in one sammy for blue collar workers in a rush looking for a one handed lunch! Now this delicious treat is a great late night eat after spending time at the bar!"}
{"text":"Based on what I've read on yelp, I tried the Pastrami.  The cole slaw, fries, meat, and the italian bread all came together in a really HUGE sandwhich that was really good for a few reasons.  Flavor, texture, quantity, and presentation.  Ordered a couple of Yuenglings to wash it all down...not bad."}
{"text":"Stuck in Pittsburgh overnight at some crappy business hotel?  Live a little!  Flip off the tube, put on some non-descript clothes, get a cab, and tell the cabbie to take you to Primanti's in the Strip downtown.  The original Primanti's is open 24 hours and serving up their signature sandwiches with the fries and vinegar-pepper coleslaw IN the sandwich.  These are among the best sandwiches I've ever had, anywhere, period, and I say that as a Clevelander who would normally die before praising anything about this town.  Fries in the sandwich make it special but everything about these sandwiches are scrumptious.  I love the classic corned beef verions but I also like it with  ham, fried egg, cheese, the fries, and of course the cole slaw.  I love this part of Pittsburgh and try to get a Primanti every time I come to the Steel City."}
{"text":"Pretty good...interesting. You order a sandwich, you get no plate! Clever actually. I would go back. I had the fish and cheese sandwich...fries and coleslaw was on the sandwich as well! I was super hungry!"}
{"text":"Do NOT order the CHEESESTEAK!  Do NOT order the CHEESESTEAK.   It basically hamburger patty sitting in hot water all day.   Get either the pastrami, cornbeef or roast beef.  The cornbeed is my fav especially with an egg

As a footnote DO NOT ORDER THE CHEESESTEAK!!!!!   Don't be fooled by the #2 seller label!"}
{"text":"(monroeville location) Been here many times over the past year.  The sandwiches and the service have been consistent.  Good place to watch a game as well.  The garlic parmesean sauce for the wings is one of my favorites.  The wings are crispy but they are too small for the $5 fee (a dollar per tiny wing).   The cornbeef with an egg again was a winner and left the belly of mine fully satisfied.  

OUT OF TOWNERS please read the following.

If its your first time at a primantis DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT  order the steak n cheese.   It is their worst sandwich and i have no idea how it became their #2 seller.  Go for the cornbeef or pastrami with an egg and load up the devil sauce."}
{"text":"Sort of Pittsburgh's answer to the garbage plate. Their sandwiches arent exactly something a sane person would eat during normal hours (check the meat out...it's basically Boars Head quality). At 11-1am, this is a perfect sandwich to soak up the carbs. The sleepers are the vinegar slaw (think Montreal style) and the fresh cut fries which were quite good. It's an institution in Pittsburgh but it's better for a late night run."}
{"text":"Great service excellent food huge portions.  The world famous sandwiches live up to our reputation.  He had corned beef and I had pastrami.  Both were perfect without fuss.   I usually have to add mustard for a sandwich for it to be complete but the vinegar coleslaw balanced all the other flavors nicely. The fresh baked bread was just right for the sandwich but also a great base for their delicious bread pudding."}
{"text":"Worth a try, but in my opinion, this location was not worth the hype. It was very busy, a few seats opened up at the counter so my family and I squeezed in to place an order for carry out. We left about 25 minutes later and ate at a near by park only to discover that we were missing items! 

We were charged for, but did not get the Ragin' Cajun chicken sandwich or the marinara sauce to accompany the mozzarella triangles side. We split the food up for our picnic lunch and decided to make do. 

I found the meat in my pastrami sandwich to be the best part of the meal. There wasn't enough meat to make the whole thing good. The fries stuffed in the sandwich tasted more like grease then anything. They lacked flavor and texture. Maybe it was because we took the order to go, but the drive to the park was less than 10 minutes and the fries were so limp-y. I also did not like the coleslaw as much as I thought I would. There was so much of it, I scrapped some off to eat on the side. I would have liked the sandwich a lot more with seasoning on the fires, less slaw, and more meat. The signature Italian bread was good, but I would have preferred it toasted. I know, I know, maybe I should just stick to another restaurant or my own kitchen, right? Well, it's just my opinion :)

BP and my brother had the Pittsburger. The patties were a bit thin, but it tasted pretty good. BP actually liked the slaw and he usually hates coleslaw! My sister mom and dad traded pieces of the Tuna and Fish and Cheese. Tuna was good, hard to mess that up, but the Fish and Cheese was greasy and the fillets of fish were lost among the fries and slaw. 

The mozzarella triangles were good, but not quite awesome because of the missing marinara. I could not wait to eat them so I ate them sauce-less. The fried pickles also ordered were not as good since the breading just slid off the pickle spears and were soggy. The sauce served with the spears was pretty good and tangy. 

After we were all done eating, we went back to the restaurant to pick-up the missing Ragin' Cajun. It was ready waiting for us in a paper bag held by an apologetic waitress, which was nice. 

We were pretty stuffed from eating earlier, so I am a fan of the portion size at Primanti. We split the Ragin' Cajun and everyone had a few bites. I loved how HOT the chicken was and that it was cooked well.

Primanti Bros- Oakland: Worth a try, just check your order if carrying out on a busy day!"}
{"text":"I was happy to have visited this location of Primanti's while in town to see the hubby's family in Pittsburgh and Greensburg. We went for a lunch and for it being the day after Christmas, I honestly expected a lot more staff to be available than there were. There were plenty of open seats, but diners had to wait for quite a while before being seated since the staff working the floor were busy delivering orders or placing them and it seemed like cleaning the tables off had the lowest priority. 

I'll be quite honest, we were a large party:18 adults, and our server was visibly stretched a bit thin, but managed to stop by the table twice to make sure our glasses were filled... 

Compared to other locations I have visited, this Primanti just wasn't the same when it came to the food. The hubby and I split an order of the pastrami and had a few bites of the corned beef as well. The corned beef seemed a bit off (not rotten, but just did not taste as flavorful and actually was a bit gamey). The pastrami, thankfully, was superb. It was salty the bread and the slaw together had a nice bite. I was a bit disappointed because I didn't feel there were enough fries crammed in the sandwich and it was a bit drier than I anticipated, as if the sandwich was put together in a hurry and not allowed time to let the juices soak a bit. I was also upset with the flavor of the onion rings. The oil clearly needed to be changed because it had that bitter, sharp, taste that just made the rings taste awful. I think eventually this was done since we also placed an order of the fried zucchini later and those did not have that same taste. The cornmeal batter on the zucchini was quite tasty and I enjoyed the longer, planked shape these were served as rather than circular pieces I have seen elsewhere. We also shared an order of the nachos and I felt the ratio of chips to the \"good stuff\" was very off. A lot of us basically just had sour cream and dry chips. 

Also, where is the Pittsburgh pride? Sure, sure, there are jerseys and sport memorabilia all around, but I am talking about the generic ketchup bottles on the table. I could taste the Heinz inside, but was surprised that the bottles were not Heinz bottles themselves.

I don't think we will return to this location since we are not usually in the area, but I was thankful that there was plenty of free parking right outside the location."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think that fries on a sandwich would be good, would it be greasy, no way--- the best damn sandwich you'll find, I get Capicola, which is far from greasy. Great bar, totally Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We were not acknowledge when we walked in and had to ask to be seated. The service from our waiter was decent. The fries are so nasty. The sweet tea is okay. The chicken gyro was blah. The outside of the establishment reeked of sewage water. The floors were slippery. I will not be coming to this restaurant again and will not recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"FAMOUS FOR:
- Sandwiches

BUZZ
- Pastrami Sandwich
- Corned Beef Sandwich

I TRIED
- The Pitts Burger (Sandwich) (7/10)
- Almost Famous Hot Chili Bowl (4/10)

I really need to start researching early before these trips! I had a big First World Problem. My hotel was 30 minutes south. But the 2 candidates for dinner tonight was either a Pittsburgh staple (Primanti Brothers) or a Triple D joint (LoBello's), and they were both north east of where I was. I had already set my mind to LoBello's, because I haven't had a Triple D place in a while, but when Primanti Brothers ended up being on the way (and 10 minutes closer), I just decided to change plans and go to Primanti. 

The place is kind of set up like a Fridays. There's one side that has more of a dining feel to it, and then the other side is a bar, also with booths and tables. 

This sudden switch made me very ill prepared for Primanti. Luckily, my server, when finding out I was new to Primanti Bros, explained that they were famous for their sandwiches and that the big list of sandwiches were all made the same way, just various meats. He also explained that the Pitts Burger is the most popular. The menu says it's the #2 item, because beer is the #1. Lol! I like it! Oh, and I don't really get the reference, but a lot of things here, including the sandwiches, are considered \"Almost Famous.\" Why? I dunno.

PITTS BURGER
So, a Primanti Sandwich contains french bread, your meat(s) of choice, cole slaw, tomatoes, and provolone cheese. Because I only had this Primanti Brothers location come up in Yelp on my phone, with 52 reviews, I didn't know that most people ACTUALLY get the pastrami. So, I ordered the Pitts Burger, because the menu says it's the most popular sandwich.

So, the meat on this is what they call a \"Philly Cheesteak patty.\" I understand that to be the brick of meet that Philly cheesesteaks are sliced from. Whatever the case, the patty tastes just like Salisbury Steak (minus the gravy). It's got that soft, artificial meat texture, and that buttery, savory flavor. 

As everyone else has said, the coleslaw is vinegar based, not mayo based. Now, I don't know if the slaw changed the flavor at all, or if they added something else, but there was definitely a sweetness to the vinegar. It actually went very well with the sandwich. It's probably not a cole slaw I'll want to eat by itself, but I think it does a lot more for the sandwich than mayo-based cole slaws (i.e. Lucky's Sandwich Co in Chicago).

Tomato was nothing special. The french bread is interesting. I'm used to seeing it in the grocery stores, but by the time you bring it home and slice it, the crust is usually pretty hard and/or crunchy (which I'm totally fine with!). Here the bread part is very soft, and the crust is still pretty soft too - almost on par with regular sandwich bread crust. What I liked about it, though, is that the bread was actually pretty transparent in flavor, so it didn't take away from the sandwich, like bread always does.

But then we come to the fries. These fries suck. Literally! Mine were kind of cold, and some didn't feel like they were cooked fully through. The fries by themselves are not very good either - pretty bland. That blandness actually sucked flavor out of the bite! I noticed that the sandwich was SIGNIFICANTLY better when I took a bite around the edges, where the fries mostly fell off, than in the middle where all the fries bunched up. Now, with the cole slaw being strong as it is, I'm not suggesting they take out the fries, but I think if they reduced the fries by about 1/2, this sandwich may have earned another star.

All in all, the sandwich was pretty good. The cheesesteak patty or salusbury steak or whatever it was was definitely something I've never had in sandwich form, so A+ in creativity! 

Oh, and FYI - if you order the sandwich, all you get is a sandwich! No fries, chips, or anything else. I was mostly satisfied with just the sandwich, but it would've been nice to munch on something else alongside it.

CHILI
Toward the halfway point of my sandwich, I didn't think this was going to satiate my hunger, so I ordered a bowl of \"PIttsburgh Style Chili.\" Turns out, the sandwich made me a lot fuller than I thought, and i only had 1/2 the chili. Ok, I'm NOT an expert at chili at all. I love Wendy's chili, so use that as my curriculum vitae. 

The chili was really thick, with way more beans than anything else. The flavor was more tomato-y, gettin kinda close to ketchup. There were certain bites that had a very blunt chili pepper flavor, but not the norm. Seasoning was a bit weak, but the saltines made it even thicker and less enjoyable. Not a fan.

ALMOST DELICIOUS
This place is basically a glorified bar. Pizzas, burgers, buffalo wings, and sandwiches. Even though a 7/10 is a decent score (for the Pitts Burger), I'm willing to come back one more time to see if the pastrami knocks me off my feet. Nothing else on the menu is really all that unique or enticing."}
{"text":"So people rave about this place, and there are many of them now around Pittsburgh. You get exactly what you think you are getting, no frills just good old meat and carbs. It's  fun, you can sit outside in market square, the wait staff are friendly, you can people watch and fill up on a sandwich that you have to dislocate your jaw to eat, filled with fries and coleslaw. This place is iconic, give it a try, it's not gourmet, but sometimes you just want simple."}
{"text":"Genuinely confused why this place is famous. So there are coleslaw and fries inside the sandwich...cool. A few places have that concept for their sandwich shops these days. The food here though was not at all good. The lack of creativity in their menu was less than impressive, however, the overall lack of flavor was most disappointing. We ordered the hot fried pickles - disappointing, I had to concentrate on each chew to try and find flavor in what I was eating. We also ordered the Pit which is apparently their best selling sandwich. Again, genuinely confused. How is this the best selling sandwich on the menu? The meat had no flavor, the coleslaw was nothing, the fries were better outside the sandwich...I don't know. You would think that with so much going on, there was flavor somewhere in here...except there was none. So much going on and so little flavor. 

The waitress was nice though, so one star for you cuz of her! Yay"}
{"text":"Come here for the \"famous\" cole-slaw-and-french-fry-topped sandwiches. It's a great place to bring out-of-towners. The prices aren't bad, and the Forbes location is in the heart of Oakland, so within walking distance of a lot of great hangouts."}
{"text":"2 stars for cleanliness
3 stars for food

This location wasn't exactly clean. The floors were pretty sticky and our table was not cleaned before sitting down. Nevertheless, we still ate here because we were hungry and wanted to see what the hype was all about. We ordered their number 1 best seller (beer), their number 2 seller which was the burger, wings, and chili fries. The sandwich was huge and big enough to share with my hubby. I don't think I would be able to finish one on my own. They are known for placing fries in their sandwiches! The cole slaw was by far my favorite thing on the sandwich. It was light and refreshing because they make it with apple cider vinegar. The wings were decent but I would highly suggest not ordering their chili fries. The chili looked like it came straight out of can and was dumped onto the fries.  If I would have to visit next time, I would stick to ordering their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for a couple of years now and I just recently had this on my college campus a few months ago. It definitely is known as a Pittsburgh food. I normally don't like cole slaw but somehow this was just different. It tasted good because it complimented the fries with its tartness. I definitely would recommend to at least try and you can even just ask for the cole slaw off."}
{"text":"As other outsiders have said, this must be a Picksburgh thing because they are wildly successful and have multiple locations throughout the city.  This was our first and definitely last visit with these Bros.  We came in for a late lunch.  It was somewhat busy, but not that busy, and yet chaos ensued as the hostess seated some people, ignored others (like us), then seated some more out of order, and oh, you twos just standing there need a table too (um, no, we just like to walk into places and stare at others as they eat).  Eventually we are directed to a dirty table and wonder if we are supposed to order at a counter or a server comes to the table.  In hindsight, I am glad that it was dirty because I saw a bucket of dirty water on a bar stool where the hostess would repeatedly dip an old towel into and wipe down tables. 

The menu is primarily sandwiches, fries, soup and chili.  The big deal is that they put fries and slaw on top of your sandwich, and it looks like a monster sized sandwich.  As we continue wondering about the ordering process, a very bored looking young man comes over and takes our order.  I chose the Ragin Cajun chicken sandwich, and my husband chose the Pastrami and a side of fries.  

The first items to arrive at the table are the diet cokes.  The menu does not offer a range of sizes, so we figure, it's a standard size or a large.  Wrong.  It's a child's size drink except there is no lid.  I guess spills not a worry here because that bucket of dirty water is ready to go.  And also no straw, but I spyed some on the bar so I helped myself.  Next the fries came out.  They looked like fresh cut fries, and we munched on those as we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more for our sandwiches to come out.  My husband said fries were soggy, and I said they are fresh like Inn N Out.  I was wrong.  Please forgive me Inn N Out, I was just delirious with hunger, they are nothing like yours!  Sandwiches kept whizzing past us, and no kidding, everyone around us had theirs, even people who ordered after us.  I think bored young man went home or found something less boring to do than wait on us.  Finally, sandwiches come out, and they do this weird thing where they barely cover them in paper and just plop them down on the table, no plate of any kind.  My sandwich looks pretty good, but taste wise, there's nothin Ragin about that Cajun.  Fries in sandwich and those we ordered on the side, extremely lacking salt, and as my husband said, soggy.  Slaw on sandwich is just cabbage in vinegar which is fine with me because it's healthier, but again it lacked seasoning.  I ended up pulling chicken out of sandwich and just eating that alone.  My husband, extremely dissatisfied and not understanding why I chose this place.  Like I said, it's a Picksburgh thing!"}
{"text":"So had a short stop at pittsburgh before heading out to the airport and decided to go on a food adventure...  After getting lost and going to the closed location, I finally found this one at market square.  I paid for parking and boy was it worth it!

The classic pastrami is too good! Crisped edges and stacked with vinegary slaw and crisp homey fries!  Lived up to the hype! Trip was worth it."}
{"text":"Coming in on a Saturday between around 4:30PM, this place was still busy. Tourists taking photos, smoke filling the doorway as the grill is cooking fresh food. Whisked to the bar on the opposite side, I missed seeing the grill as I ate.

Yes! Pastrami with french fries smashed in between, chili cheese fries, and a beverage (this was my only meal for the day).

Pastrami - I wish they let me order the pastrami without the fries. Fries in this sandwich takes away from the pastrami. Meat was lean, bread a little too soft and not as durable as I worked my way through the it. 

Chili Cheese fries - At first, waitress wouldn't let me order it \"Honey, sandwich so big, you don't need the chili cheese fries.\" So after I showed I'm a big boy and can handle the pastrami, she let me order the fries.

Customer Service - They are so busy so there were periods where no one checked on me while I was desperate for a refill on my beverage. There was an older gentleman who was either an owner or previous general manager who kept making comments about the food, helping take drink orders, and was just a good spirit to have at the bar to entertain us."}
{"text":"When I learned that I was going to Pittsburgh on business, before I booked my room or flight, I looked at the schedule and figured out when I could get to Primanti's in the Strip district.
After seeing this sandwich temple on DDD, Man Vs.Food, Bourdain, and too many other shows, I knew it was a \"can't miss\". I'm a sandwich junkie, you see.
The Hyatt hotel shuttle dropped me off and I was a little shocked at how tiny the room was. I learned later there was another larger room that was closed.
I found a good place at the bar, and the place was blissfully not so crowded. There were two guys behind said bar who moved like machines, taking care of the entire place, and One of them was the cook. They were not chummy-friendly-talkative, but pro and attentive. They were too busy to bullshit. 
The gal at the front desk of the Hyatt advised to get the \"Double Egg and Cheese\" I asked the guy who was nominally the Primanti's  Waiter what he recommended, and he said that it was all good, but his favorite was the Capicolla. I had taken a call from the gent I was in Pitts to see, and he also said \"Capicolla\", but with a fried egg. I'm not a big fried egg lover, but  as I am a fan of the \"Gabbagool\" I ordered it..
The guy behind the grill worked like lightning, slicing bread and throwing meat and cheese on the grill. Assembling sandwiches at all speed, I soon got my Primantis special.
They serve on Waxed Paper-I watched the Waiter Guy carry 5 of the giant sandwiches at a time to a table. No dishes. Smart.
Everyone knows (or should know) the scoop on Primanti's is the Fries and Coleslaw are all piled on top of the meat and cheese, between the bread. As I am a longtime devotee of Henry's Hot Dogs in Cicero, Illinois, where they, too, pile the Fries right on top of the Dog, I had no disconnect with the usual starchy side dish's  elevation to the main course. Any Chicagoan Gourmet worth his salt will also not blanch at the heaping of vegetables on top of a sandwich, as  \"dragging through the garden\" is the hallmark of any great Chicago Dog. Bring it on, Mr. Primanti.
The first thing is flashed on was the bread. It looked like a normal Italian loaf, like the kind we get from Turano here in Chicago, cut on the bias to make a larger slice. 
This bread had a different flavor-It was rich and I even detected a hint of sweetness. It wouldn't surprise me if there wasn't a Semolina component to the bread. The crust and crumb were tender. Fabulous fabulous bread.
The coleslaw was simple-vinegar, pepper and a little sweet-finely shredded and tasty as hell.
I've gotta say that I'm not the biggest lover of French Fries. I seldom order them, but as they are an integral part of the Primanti's joint, I embraced the spud. The Primanti's edition are fresh cut, fried fresh, and were actually very very tasty. 
The Provolone Cheese and Gabbagool were fine but nothing special. 
There is a gestalt thing going on here. The sum was greater than the parts. All together, the Primantis Sandwich was unlike anything I've ever had, and was totally enjoyable. The atmosphere was easy going-then again I was there on a Sunday evening. I'll bet it gets manic in there. 
There are other Primantis in Pitts. and I was told the branches trump the Flagship, but I kinda dug the \"Strip\" District. And btw, the \"strip\" district has nothing to do with folks doffing their clothes. It's an entertainment/dining district. adjacent to Downtown Pitsburgh.
I almost ordered a second sandwich, having layed low on intake all day knowing the Primanti's trip was nigh, but a second number would have been uncomfortable. I was still a bit peckish, so I ordered a few things that would not provoke guilt if I didn't finish. An order of the fine bread and butter, and more of the divine coleslaw. It was just the right capper.
If I was going to carp about anything, it would be the small drink glasses-had to get a bunch of refills on my Diet Coke (which had a good throw, incidentally)
Is it the greatest Sarnie I ever had? No. But was it a fine experience and a good feed? Absolutely! Solid 4 stars. Go there!!"}
{"text":"I ate here a while ago when in Pittsburgh for a conference. Before I arrived in Pittsburgh, everyone raved about this place that puts the fries in the sandwich, so one night I walked from my hotel to the restaurant.

I liked that it was informal and friendly. My sandwich was quite average and to be truthful I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the fries having in my younger days helped a friend at his French fries cart at the Sandwich Fair in Sandwich, NH.

So overall if you visit Pittsburgh, you should try Primanti's at least once for the experience. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place had great food, I dont typically like coleslaw but theirs was almost like a sauerkraut so I really enjoyed it! I wasn't a fan of the size of the chicken breast that was on my sandwich but it tasted really good... Just wish it was bigger ! If it was a little bigger it would get a 5 star! Lol"}
{"text":"The sandwich was cold. A cold sandwich. A sandwich which is cold. 

When I think of a hot cheese steak sandwich I imagine a first degree burn on the top of my mouth, not biting into cold pieces of bread with cold fries and a luke warm beef patty.

Also, the server was counting money on the area that they were cutting the sandwiches :S

Two stars. Sorry."}
{"text":"nothing to write home about. nothing really had any taste. not enough seasoning or cheese on their sandwiches. lots of us tried different sandwiches and really none of us thought they were anything special. maybe just go to the original location.
glorified applebees"}
{"text":"Saw Primanti Brother's on Man Vs. Foods.....
 Amazed by the burger loaded with fries and coleslaw, we had to make it a must stop on our trip to Pittsburgh......

Place was packed, luckily there were only 2 of us and we found a seat pretty quickly.
What's not to love!? A burger with fries, coleslaw on yummy Italian bread and a cold beer. Delicious! My husband, who hates coleslaw even loved!

This place seems to be a Pittsburgh staple and we make sure everyone we know who is visiting Pittsburgh goes. If they are confused after our burger description, we have them watch Man Vs. Food, after that they can't wait to try it!

Will definitely be going back ! Unfortunately it will be during football season, hopefully we will get in! Not sure about the Jet fans we will be bringing with us =)"}
{"text":"You get exactly what you order: A giant sandwich with some fries jammed right up in there! I ordered the pastrami because I heard there was nothing really different about their burgers and I don't think there is anything much different about their pastrami sandwich either. It is big (I order with an egg, double meat, and onions) and I could barely finish it. One sandwich can easily feed two people, but I never back down from a challenge! The bread was nice and soft and the sandwich had a nice kick, but it really is just is a larger than normal sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a Pittsburgh staple with a lot of options on the menu. The sandwiches are of course delicious, along with the pizza, salads, wings, and more! There's something on the menu for everyone and it's a great environment. Whether you're a local or not, you have to check out a Primanti's!"}
{"text":"On my small scale Man vs Food tour I had to hit this place, went later at night and it was ok. I had the traditional pramanti sandwich, which I have to say is a lot. The sandwich was very filling. The atmosphere is like a dive bar but the pittsburg nostalgia is heavy, if I wanted a pramanti I'd go to this location. I guess I'm not the pramanti traditionalist because I eventually put my fries on the side and dipped them in ketchup."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches (like you'd expect at a Primanti Bros), and very good service.  No complaints at our table - we all enjoyed the unique Primanti Bros sandwiches.  The cole slaw, with it's vinegar based dressing, does tend to overpower the flavor of the sandwich, but it was still a delicious sandwich.  This particular Primanti Bros was rather small & cramped, but it had a cool atmosphere to it.  We've been to one other Primanti Bros, but it was out in the suburbs of Pittsburgh somewhere, and had more of a chain restaurant (like Applebees or Red Robin) feel to it.  This one on Forbes Ave in Oakland, it had better atmosphere.  There were no plates or silverware, they served the sandwiches on wax paper.  The service was fast & they got you your food.  It was fresh & tasty.  I'll be back again if we are visiting Pitt University."}
{"text":"I live in Gibsonia and on most occassions we get take out from this location.  To be fair the sandwiches are great but the pizza is only average.  I am used to the market square location and the sandwiches are on pare and have exceeded my expectations for a surburbon location.  The food is always ready on time or even a little before they give me for a time (which I really appreciate).  For take out I would highly recomend this location for sandwiches but not necessarily the pizza."}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh institution.  The original is in the strip district just outside of downtown proper.  They are famous for large sandwiches with the fries IN the sandwich, not on the side.  Idea was born out of truckers wanting a meal they could eat on the road.  Yes, if you are in PIT you should probably go once just to say you've been there.  That being said, I have been a number of times and tried a number of different sandwiches and to be honest they all were fairly bland.  Lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return 5 minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong. We didn't see her for a good 20 minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills. She did take one of our cups to refill it, sat it on the bar and left it there for 10 minutes, when we finally saw her again had to ask her to grab it off the bar. Highly disappointing Philly cheesesteak!! The meat in it is that of a frozen Salisbury steak TV dinner!! French fries were good."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience at the Washington location, I decided to give the Waterfront Primantis a try while I was out in the area. We walked in and were seated immediately in the back section. It was a fairly busy night, the bar looked completely full, with maybe 15 other tables. There were servers walking around everywhere but no one waited on us until about 15 minutes after we were seated. They all just kept walking by very nonchalantly. I get if you're busy and don't get to your table right away. But they should have least acknowledged that they would be with us shortly. When our server finally realized we hadn't been waited on he came rushing over to take our order. We came on wing night so we gave a shot at some wings. We order 5 honey buffalo, 5 honey BBQ, and 5 honey mustard. We also ordered the \"Almost Famous\" Angus Sirloin steak & cheese sandwich. This sandwich is usually served with coleslaw and fries on top but we asked for the slaw on the side. When the food came out, the slaw was on top of the sandwich so we had to send it back. 
The wings were good! I personally love crispy wings so they were great! And the sandwich was also amazing too. I'm not a huge fan of the slaw but I found myself dipping into the slaw on the side. 
Aside from the service, the trip here was great. I just wish that the employees would communicate more and let the servers know they have tables waiting for them."}
{"text":"Caught an Uber over from the dahntahn DoubleTree ($7). It'd been years since my last Primanti so I headed over to refresh the memory. I ordered an HBK in homage to the Penguins namesakes; and the reason I was back in the area. The sandwich was good but super filling as might be expected. The ham, bacon, and kielbasa were all delicious. The fries seemed a little flat though. Just not much flavor at all to them. The slaw was crisp and a nice twang. Left satisfied and full. Service was fairly quick and food served equally as timely. They were not busy when I arrived or left. Maybe a handful of tables or bar-seats were occupied. Enjoyed looking at the artwork on the walls."}
{"text":"I moved to Pittsburgh in October 2001 and one of the first things I heard about was Primanti Brothers. I have gone to this location twice with a friend who was born and raised here, but I have yet to try their food. In fact, I have yet to place an order!

Both times I have gone to this location, my friend and I have been ignored. If we ask to place an order, we're told \"I'll be with you in a minute\" and then resume being ignored while other customers who came in after us are served. 

Is it because I am plus sized? Is it because my male friend has long, painted fingernails? Is it something else? I don't know for sure. And I did try a second time in case there was some other problem (new staff?) the first time with the same results.

I have to say that at this point, I am unlikely to ever patronize ANY Primanti Brothers' location."}
{"text":"There's not much I can say here about the food that hasn't already been said. As a vegetarian, you can get a cheese combo sandwich as long as you aren't concerned about cross-contamination with meat.

Rather, I am here to write about the atmospheric experience. I would consider this particular Primanti's to be for the tourists and out of towners who think that bad service is part of getting the Primanti's experience. 

I have gone to this location many times and for many years, as it was minutes from where I used to live. I marveled at the rude service time and time again, but gave some excuse to how busy the restaurant was at the time (particularly if it is only open on the bar side). There was one day, however, that aside from myself and my husband there were only two other customers in the shop. My husband asked for his cheese combo to be made only with one type of cheese--as he had done countless times--and the waiter refused, saying it was impossible and touting he had worked there for 15 years and he knew what they could make. He told us that we had never been served that sandwich in that way. He tried to retract and communicate as humans do, but he couldn't pull it off for long. The waiter continued to be gruff and sharp until we were mercifully given our food that was ordered as carry out. 

In my opinion, there's no reason for their staff to behave in such a way. It makes for an unpleasant experience and the story I relayed to you above makes me think that their behavior is a result of the lack of service skills since it even appears when the shop isn't busy.

Unless you are coming in for a special visit (as many do because of food related shows), I suggest the Oakland location where the staff is consistently friendly."}
{"text":"I used to go here in my university days. The food is pretty good and it's open 24 hours. A good place for a late night snack. The Pittsburgher and pastrami were my favorites. I went to one in Ft. Lauderdale recently and it was a total blast from the past. You can read my dish reviews at http://www.dishadish.com/restaurant/26845-Primanti+Brothers."}
{"text":"This was a fun sandwich as I was visiting Pittsburgh. It was neat to hear the origin that truck drivers just wanted their cole slaw & fries slapped in with the sandwich so they could eat it on the go. I appreciate the concept & it's worth a try but I don't need to come back. I liked fat heads more."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how much I love this Pittsburgh tradition. This location is the original and is open 24 hours.  I rec"}
{"text":"ALL IN ! The sandwiches here have it all. A large amount of meat and cheese, slaw and fries all in one great sandwich. Served on butcher paper with a soda, simply the best. Have to go to one of the many locations every time I'm in the city of Champions !"}
{"text":"Wow a real dive bar, but a great deal for food. I got the grilled cheese which was just ok especially since the fries were kind of old. The food was kind of bland and greasy. Overall it just ok."}

{"text":"I was recommended to go here by a few locals as a Pittsburgh institution. No misrepresentations of what this place is about...its a bar that serves sandwiches. Went late (as they seem to be open daily until midnight which is nice!) on Father's Day and was pleasantly surprised that while I spent the day traveling for work away from my kids & family, that they had a free sandwich promo for dads!! Had a beer and burger for $6.50.

Burger was a little slow for a relatively quiet evening at roughly 25 minutes, but it was pretty good for a bacon burger. Juicy and well dressed with perfectly crisp bacon! LOVE THE FRESH CUT POTATO FRIES! Nothing better than perfectly cooked, dirty cut fries. 

Plenty of screens and sports. If you want high brow gourmet - stay away, if you want a solid restaurant burger and fries for $6...come 'n get it!"}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere, nostalgic, food and service.
Pastrami sandwich one of the best cuts of pastrami I've had to date.
Service was fast and attentive.  Being in the food service industry myself, they do great.
I'd like to see some of the people on here complaining about service try to keep up with the masses ordering sandwiches non stop and keep a smile on your face for 8 hours....be easy on these guys. It ain't easy feeding drunk people all night long!
Will be back next time in Pitt!"}
{"text":"If you're reading this you probably already know what Primanti Bros is all about. Slaw and fries on your sandwich and a TON of meat. I love the Pittsburger, their number 2 seller (alcohol is number 1). The fries are a little starchy with very little salt but mixed in with the meat you can't tell. The fries by themselves might be a little dry. There is a lot of food in one order so arrive hunger or be prepared for leftovers. On busy days there is a doorman directing attendees to open seats, otherwise it is sit yourself. The chili cheese fries are also great! A Pittsburgh iconic restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd or 4th Primanti's location I have visited, the atmosphere at this original location is definitely the best.  I came here on Saturday with my family as they were in town from NY visiting, as well as my boyfriend and his mom.  My dad is the one who suggested that he wanted to try Primanti's after seeing/hearing about it from TV and Pittsburgh locals. As for me, even though it was my birthday and this isn't my favorite place, I was happy to take them to experience a Pittsburgh original. 

It was very busy and the woman who was hostessing was very quick to tell us our large party must wait outside. Didn't ask a name, tell you how long.. just don't come in.  The guys took a little walk while some of us girls snuck in after we saw a few parties leave.  Once inside it only took about 10 minutes for us to be seated.

It seamed our waitress had the same attitude/mind set as our waitress - maybe it was because they were busy, but it wasn't as pushy at any of the other times I have tried Primanti's. I ordered the fish and cheese sandwich because I'm not a huge lunchmeat fan, nor have a found one of their sandwiches that I think is worth eating again. I want so much to like their meals because I love the concept w/ the fries and coleslaw. I am was happy with my decision to get fish - it went perfectly with the coleslaw and if I ever find myself back at another location, I will be happy to order it again.  Even though they are always too big for me to finish a full serving. My boyfriend tried a new one for him and got the Kielbasa, which he usually loves, so I am not surprised that he really enjoyed this.  Some of my family ordered the Pittsburger version and said they liked it. I have had this before and was less that impressed, it wasn't a nice juicy burger, instead it was a dry piece of ground cube steak. Our drinks and food arrived quickly, and they have a fast turn over so my one tip would be that if it seems like there is a wait, stick it out because it is likely it won't be long."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday during Lent and I got the cheesesteak. Oh and I gave up fries for Lent, I think Jesus will forgive me because c'mon, it's Primanti's!!!

Just as good as my last visit eight years ago!"}
{"text":"I love Primanti's. There are a few locations, depending on the one you go to, and the time of day there is an open bar, live music, and a place to dance. Also you most love a 2 fist-ed sandwich with everything on it."}
{"text":"Growing up in the Burgh and IMHO they know what it takes to establish a decent bar and Pittsburgh does this better than any city in the USA. Now the food, decent bar grub and of course they are almost famous for their overstuffed sandwiches with everything but the kitchen sink thrown on there including slaw and fries.

It's the bomb - the belly bomb that is.  Now for the stainless topped bar, very cool and the barmaid working the Pens hockey game the night my buddy and I were there, very cool as well as she was always on her game.  Most of the patrons drinking these 23 oz draft beers, life is good in Pittsburgh.

It all seems to come together here at this Primanti Bros. location in the South Hills.  I enjoyed my visit and shall return."}
{"text":"I don't  care what anyone else says!!!
About Primanti Bros. Double  beef and cheese that's all you need to know!!!
Love the sirloin beef too also had pork schnitzel which I think is the best sandwich. The pizza is always tasty as-well it is better than some pizza shops that I've been to. I love the sever the staff here are super and friendly. Great job"}
{"text":"We had a great first time. Bartender was good and the space is comfortable. I will definitely be back.

Also, everyone should stop by for the late night food deals!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. I had Angel as a waitress and she was outstanding. She was on top of everything and brought you everything before you even asked for it!"}
{"text":"Nice place . Couple of tv screens. Many many sandwiches. My wife loves sandwiches. God i wish she were here. Had the wings. Very tasty. Daughter ordered the cheese fries. Fries in here suck! Food is good. Daughter also had the root beer float from IBC & enjoyed it. I had the pitts-burgh a local staple. Yummy. Nice lively atmosphere. Saw this place on man vs food show and had to come try it out."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers, though iconic, doesn't live up to its widespread popularity. While Primanti's sandwiches are acceptable, they're certainly not the best in Pittsburgh, let alone Oakland.

Primanti's take on cole slaw acts as the unsung hero of the sandwich. Rather than the traditional, mayonnaise heavy, leaden version of the stuff Primanti's delicately flavors their cabbage with vinegar, herbs, and black pepper. The result is sweet, tangy, fresh, and crisp. The sandwiches warrant a taste for the fabulous cole slaw alone. That being said, it does not complement many of the meats on the menu particularly well, so make sure you order a meat that offers a salty or spicy contrast to the tangy slaw. These include corned beef, pastrami, kielbasa, fish, and capicola. The more mildly flavored meats fail to meet the sandwich's potential.

The better known gimmick of course with Primanti's is the fries on the sandwiches, which makes their product instantly recognizable. Unfortunately, the fries are often improperly cooked and tragically underseasoned, so it's more like you're eating soggy, bland, boiled spuds rather than crisp, flavorful fries. I do appreciate the handcut slices of Italian bread, but the stuff has little character outside a crisp crust. It really serves no other purpose than holding everything together (which it surprisingly does well) but I like my bread with flavor.

All told, while Primanti's is a Pittsburgh icon, the sandwich fails to excel in most ways. Try it once for the cole slaw, then go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water, there's a lot of good things going on in the ingredients...In theory, this should've resulted in a bold flavor taste explosion, but I found myself severely let down by all of the bland ingredients piled high in front of me.  The pastrami was terrible, the coleslaw weak, and the fries were bland, dry, and flavorless.  Still bummed, my guess is that this place I more of a tourist draw now than a legit sandwich shop."}
{"text":"The 'burg classic just the way it should be.  Don't even consider asking for the fries on the side or you will receive the wrath that you deserve.  Hand sliced bread on top notch meats with crisp fried and creamy slaw
  An American classic."}
{"text":"Man I wish I lived in Pittsburgh! I would come here weekly. The sandwiches are HUGE so you better have a good appetite. I got the pastrami and cheese and it was amazing. The slaw is a vinegar based and perfectly balanced the sandwich out. The bread is thick and soft, and there's fries on the sandwich to counteract the vinegar. So amazing. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because we sat for about 30 mins before finally going to the register to order, but our sandwiches and beer came so fast."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars. It was a solid sandwich for sure. I got the corned beef which was tasty the only thing I wish they added was some kind of sauce. I'm not sure if that comes on other sandwiches but it could have used some kind of mustard. The price is great too, four sandwiches , two orders of pickles, coleslaw, fries and beer for about 40 bucks. Can't complain about that! 

I would definitely"}
{"text":"Omfg! Visiting from California and we tried this place. We literally DIED  and are happy we don't have them in town because we would eat them all the time and end up 600 lbs eventually and then really die.. I got the turkey & added bacon and my fiancé went with the pastrami , capacola and fried egg ... We were impressed."}
{"text":"Staff has been personable and attentive every time we have been to this location. Nice late night sandwich special after 9. \"Double meat\" is generously portioned when asked..."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Almost Famous Primanti Bros sandwiches. Every Time I come to Pittsburgh, I need to have one. 

Today our wait staff was Michael, he was great and helpful."}
{"text":"I enjoyed going to this location because it is close to downtown. If you like to watch people, try getting a patio table. You wont be disappointed. I also like to sit at the bar too because I get a chance to see how the sammich is made! I like that they have their systems!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here while visiting friends in the area .... After seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows I was very excited to eat hear . WOW ,,, what a dissapointment , This place is so over hyped it isnt funny . To compare this place to the famous sandwich places is NYC is a joke . The sandwiches may be big , but only because they are over stuffed with fries and cole slaw . To steal a line from a old TV commercial .... WERE'S THE BEEF .....  A major major dissapointment ."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's own \"institution\" certainly lived up to the hype.  

I knew what to expect here and I was ready.  A cheese steak sandwich (they said \"2nd most popular\") was my order and it came on a piece of waxed paper and no utensils.  This one was going to be full hands on.  

The meat was good, the fries add an awesome touch to the sandwich, and the slaw is amazing!  A local bakery supplies the bread too, so everything is so well put together!  

You can not say enough about how great this place is.  It's unique, cheap, and a regional \"institution\" that lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Another one of those things you have to try at least once if you are visiting Pittsburgh for the very first time.  I had seen them on Travel Channel as one of the Top 10 places in the country to Pig Out.  So when we came to Pittsburgh, PA, and was on vacation, I had to try it.  

It was as good as advertised.  They put the French Fries in the Sandwich and it is definitely quite unique.  

If I am ever back in Pittsburgh, I will definitely grab me another Primanti Brothers Sandwich to Pig Out On!!!"}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is one of those things you just have to do when you are in Pittsburgh.

The place is almost always packed, the food is terrible for you but...you just got to do it.

It does not get any more Pittsburgh then this!

Cash only, no plastic."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for my lunch break! I really like the place and the set up! It's kinda small but has lots of character. There's tons of tvs to watch and good music. It didn't even take me a minute to get a seat, even tho they were quite busy with lunch. 

The service was incredible ! They were so nice and friendly and all seemed to enjoy working there - even down to the cooks! I'm not sure how they manage all the people coming in and out but they have a flawless system in place! 

I ordered boneless wings with honey BBQ and fries with cheese and bacon! So delicious the BBQ sauce was exactly how I wanted it. And even was so good I dipped my cheese fries in it. Delicious. The portion on the fries was to die for! I love a place that gives you tons of fries. Overall I had a wonderful experience and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It was Sunday morning and we wanted to grab some food and coffee before we hit the road.  We tried a few coffee shops, but they weren't opening for another hour or so.  Then, we found Primanti Brothers!  Hooray for 24 hour establishments!

I'm sure my doctor wouldn't be impressed to find out how much grease I ingested first thing in the morning.  There are some breakfast items on their menu (i.e. eggs and bacon), but it's not really a breakfast joint.  I opted for the bacon and cheese sandwich.  Huge portion and completely different from any other sandwich I've ever had.  Special ingredients include coleslaw and fries (in the sandwich).  I also tried their coffee and it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I went here with three friends after a Pirates game on a Saturday night in July of 2004. It was the last stop on a weekend baseball roadtrip from Baltimore to Philly to Pittsburgh and back to Baltimore. 
My three friends at at one time or another lived in PIttsburgh. Two of them had been here before (Dave and Robert) and the other one (Jerry) who lived there at the time had never been there (like me). We sat at the counter and ordered Iron City beers (what else do you order when in Pittsburgh?) while we looked at the menu. 
The waitress/barkeeper came over to take our order
I decided on the roast beef and cheese...
Dave had the pastrami and cheese
Robert had the capicola and cheese
Jerry ordered the fish and cheese...
\"Fish....no one orders the fish!\" she said.
We all kind of smiled...except Jerry
\"It's on the menu\", he said.
\"That doesn't mean you have to order it!\"
She took the orders and went back to the kitchen.
Jerry, \"Geee...she was kind of gruff...\" 
We all laughed and told him that he shouldn't have ordered the fish! :-)
She came back in a little while with our sandwiches, we probably all ordered another beer...except for Jerry. He wanted to go...;-)
So we finished our sandwiches, except for Jerry...
\"Can I have a doggie bag?\"
\"A doggie bag?\", she says.
\"I want to take the rest home for my wife.\"
\"He orders the fish, then he wants a doggie bag to take the rest home to his wife! You need to eat that sandwich, you're so skinny that  if you stood up too fast you might hang yourself as you fell through your underwear!\"
At this point Dave, Robert and I were dying from laughter...Jerry wasn't. :-)
Jerry got his doggie bag, we left and he put it in the car as we went bar hopping....

Story aside...the sandwiches are very good and very filling. I am thinking that our sandwiches and two beers came to around $15 or so. Well, Jerry's bill was less...:-))
We all tipped the server well for such an enjoyable meal and Primanti's expereince...except Jerry. ;-)

I posted some photos as well...:-)))))))))))"}
{"text":"Why do Pittsburgh folks like this place so much? Average portions on spongey white bread with damp fries - in your sandwich. The wait staff was preoccupied (the place was half full), and quite apathetic I may add. Not competitive in my eyes. 

I mean, there's a lot of TVs, and the draft beer is ice cold. And cheap. But the food is mediocre at best. The only thing this place seems good for is watching sports and drinking."}
{"text":"Have been to this location 3-4 times in the last three months, food always very good, but the service is very slow, sometimes waiting extended amount of time to get drinks before ordering the meal, and waiting too long to get the check upon finishing. Nice atmosphere though"}
{"text":"Can't imagine how they ruined Mancini's bread?
I feel that the fans of this place are more hopped up on the \"Burgh\" aspect than they are to good food, because this sure ain't it.  It is mediocre at best.  Service was abrupt and snotty.
Visitors to the city ask about it but I tell them that I value the friendship too much to jeopardize it if I took them there!"}
{"text":"If you're from PA (which most visiting this location are) it's obvious what to expect food-wise. This location is no different than the others in this sprawling chain. And, while Primanti Brothers continues to grow and become more than a local chain the quality hasn't been compromised. Instead, the same sandwiches that made this place famous on the 
Food Network continue to pace growth. 

What I like about this location is it stays open late even when most of the other area restaurants have been closed for hours. And, while most of the people here after 10pm are drinking in the bar the kitchen remains open late for those looking for a bite, like me. And, you can't beat their incredible happy hour prices. Or, the TVs that litterer the inside so we can watch sporting events. 

I still haven't embraced their pizzas, or the wings, but continue to chow down on the sandwiches (sorry, I'm never trying the sardine and cheese though!). There's an endless amount of meats available and definitely something for everyone although I'm partial to the turkey, corned beef, pastrami, sweet sausage and the cheese. If you're going to get the fries as a side sometimes it's a good idea to ask for them to be cooked well done. Most of the time, otherwise, they tend to be too mushy to eat."}
{"text":"If you're on a diet Primanti Brothers isn't for you. These are high calorie, flavorful sandwiches that a piled with lots of not so good for you treats. And, if you don't mind a little grease, lots of food and a fair price, you'll love this PA chain. And, if you're from the Pitt area this place is as stamped in your childhood as the Steelers. 

Hands down, there's no bad meal at Primanti's. Sure, we all have our favorites. I'm a fan of the turkey sandwich and the turkey and pastrami, but I must confess I still won't come here for a pizza. Meanwhile, this location yields great service, ample parking and is close enough to the airport you can grab a bite here before heading to the terminal. We do."}
{"text":"Picture the food pyramid in your head. The original one size fits all version that they used to teach kids. Now imagine someone with the culinary audacity combine all of those elements into one meal and you would get one of the Primanti Brother's famous sandwiches.

Heaping mounds of meat layered with fresh cut french fries, tomatoes, and topped off with cole slaw all on delicious freshly baked bread.  A definite must when you are in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"After watching Man v Food we were expecting the \"burger to make you forget all others\"...Ya, that didn't happen. So after telling a few others about how this place makes you walk on water we are seated by an un-happy waitress. We all joke \"what's #1 if the burger is #2\" only to be told #1 is beer.

We all order something different and decided to share for the experience. HUGE let down. I covered mine in hot sauce on the table and someone who ordered the fish couldn't even finish half of it. Pretty much zero taste and limp fries w no flavor also. After talking to \"locals\" they said the place is a tourist trap and they avoid it."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here.  Your monstrous sandwich will be delivered to you on wax paper- which explains the fries and slaw I saw on the floor.  My expectations weren't high, so I was satisfied.  Sandwich was good.  Walked in, and in ~5 minutes had 4 sandwiches in front of me (instead of waiting 40 minutes at Fat Heads -- although comparing Primanti's to Fat Head's is apples to oranges).  I imagine that this is probably the best place to come to soak up some drunk."}
{"text":"I get the appeal, I get the nostalgia, and it's a fun place to experience. My sirloin steak sandwich wasn't for me, and I'm optimistic that choosing another choice would result in a better experience, but meh. The steak was tough and chewy, which added another level of difficulty to eating the ginormous sandwich (the bread, slaw, and fries were all awesome)."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are tasty after a night out, I really like the bar specials at the South Hills location for happy hour."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches but I think they are smaller than they have been. But still great. 
Try the black angus sirloin steak sandwich.

Love the sandwiches but I think they are smaller than they have been. But still great. 
Try the black angus sirloin steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I like the sandwiches. But it is what it is: a big sandwich, that is pretty bland. I've had several different varieties over the years, and they all lack that \"zip\" or \"oomph\" that would really put them over the top. A special sauce, perhaps?"}
{"text":"If ewe don like Primanti's, yer a jag-off.

As much a Pittsburgh institution as the Stillers, Irn City, and Sophie Masloff.  Much like referring to Kleenex, to native yinzers, you just go and get a Primanti's.  No need for any further descriptives.  

The secret to the sandwich is the bread: thickly sliced Mancini's bread.  Rumor has it that Primanti's opened a location in Florida.  It didn't do very well because they weren't able to get the Mancini's.  There you go.  My favorite version of the Primanti's is the steak and cheese.  It's a beef patty and cheese (not sliced beef as in a cheese steak).  This is the only thing I will eat tabasco on.  Fresh, thick cut fries and mild vinegar based cole slaw.  Piled up perfection.

Only visit the Strip District location for the full effect.  The other locations pale in comparison."}
{"text":"love Primanti bros.great food. good service. friendly people."}
{"text":"I was brought here by some natives for some Pittsburgh gastroculture.   I had a Pittsburgh-Burgh cheesesteak, and was greeted by a gargantuan sandwich that I was to learn had both fries and cole slaw IN the sandwich.   Interesting!   Ultimately, a little too filling, but well done and with excellent service."}
{"text":"Boy do I miss Primate Bros.  I remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at 3 and 4 a.m.  We were coming back from a night of being out 'n about with friends (this was in high school/college summers in the mid-70's).  We would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries IN them.  I liked the place so much I bought and wore proudly one of their T-shirts...but alas...left it with a native friend (she also liked it alot) in Koh Samui Thailand."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Nice bar area and family dining area. Plenty of television for sports viewing and entertainment."}
{"text":"I'm wildly biased, but as a regional local who grew up on eating these when we made the trip into Pittsburgh, I'm obsessed with Primanti's. I get the same thing every time: Number 2 Cheesesteak... Dip in hot sauce mixed with ketchup. Don't ask to leave anything off; do yourself a favor and just get it as is. Cheap eats and a must try when in the 'Burgh! Pro-tip: Wash it dahn with a large IC Light."}
{"text":"I love the concept but I think it is overrated.  I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one.  I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches.

We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller).  I had half of each one along with cheese fries.  I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak.  The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me.  I am not a big fry fan in the first place.  I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option.  I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese.  I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness.

Service was a little lame as I barely could understand our \"too cool\" server.  He seemed disinterested in us for the most part.  The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful.  I like the fact that it is small and fast.  I just don't get the vast appeal.  I need sauces, fresh ingredients, whole grains, and cheese.  I would recommend for everyone to try the place once but I bet there is better options in the Burg."}
{"text":"While visiting Washington DC, our bus tour guide recommended Primanti's if we were visiting Pittsburg. Well we did visit and have no regrets. According to some \"googling\" they are a bit like Shwartz in Montreal... A local Pittsburg food staple! I had one of their best sellers, the \"PittsBurger\". A delicious burger patty topped with hand cut fries and crunchy coleslaw. These flavours all work so well together. This giant delicious mess came between two thick slices of white Italian bread. I was stuffed and my wallet was happy too... Their sandwiches aren't even expensive! Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the original location and was not displeased.

I always go for the pastrami and it is a no frills establishment.  Cash only as well so you basically order off the menu on the wall, get your sandwich, stuff your face, and leave.  

My only complaints are that I wish the fries were crispier and not so mealy, and that they put more coleslaw on the sandwich.  They were a bit stingy with it the last time.

Overall, fantastic sandwich."}
{"text":"It's been a years-long dream to stuff my gaping yaw with a sandwich from here.  Thankfully, I was able to visit Pittsburgh due to work travel and we took a client here prior to heading to the airport.

I would have preferred to go to the original location in The Strip but the timing didn't work out.  This place had ample seating and a large oval bar in the room we were seated.  I ordered a pastrami and cheese with a pickle.  This thing is large but not enormous so I was able to bite into it without too much difficulty - bonus.  The tangy coleslaw definitely cut into the cheesy savory meat but I wish there was more as it was quite sparse.  Fries were tasty and mealy but could have been a bit crisper.  I feel like it was lacking condiments but that could be due to the little coleslaw.  

However, this sandwich just works - all the flavours balance each other out and the bread is soft enough so it doesn't cut the roof of your mouth.  

This will definitely be a staple every time I come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I had a good time here.

It sort of stands on its own, opposite a beer shop and a few other little stores.

Blue moon was on offer for around $4 for a large glass, there was a wonderful server who was only too happy to help with any questions I had. 

Food was superb, my friends and I had boneless wings, chips & queso, and a pastrami sandwich. The two veggie options for sandwiches were great, a tuna one and a double cheese with egg sort of thing. Both looked great.

The sandwiches were served with a bunch of cheese, slaw, tomato, and fries on the sandwiches themselves  (sort of superb chip butties for you brits out there).

The pricing was more than reasonable, and people were in and out of here all afternoon. It seemed busy and we didn't deal with a bad member of staff. 

For what it is, it's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Great sandwich!  First time I have visited Pittsburgh so I was told I HAD to try Primanti.  Well, I was not disappointed.  I had the Pitts-Burger sandwich.  This sandwich is basically steak, lettuce, tomatoes stuffed with cole slaw and French fries!  This was a gigantic sandwich and filled me up without ordering anything else.  It was slightly difficult to eat, but I made it happen!  This was a great explosion of flavors that just worked.

If you are in Pittsburgh, you need to come here and try one of Primanti's sandwiches."}
{"text":"What touristy, first-time trip to Pittsburgh would be complete without a visit to its most famous and well-known restaurant?  As far as I was concerned, Primanti's was the top priority on my list of places to hit in the Steel City.  After reading the reviews on Yelp, I wasn't convinced that this would be the most delicious and life-changing sandwich I'd ever eat., but its iconic status makes it worth the experience.

I had really wanted to visit the original Primanti's, but since I was staying in Monroeville with my boyfriend's family, this location was clearly more convenient.  The inside reminded me of a Buffalo Wild Wings, or maybe a TGI Fridays-- family friendly, open, laid-back, and filled up wall-to-wall with decorations.  

I ordered the pastrami sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the cappicola, with the idea that we would each share our respective halves.  I was pleasantly surprised with how soft the bread was.  I think I was expecting more of a crusty sourdough type, but it was actually really light.  The cole slaw was vinegar based (which I like) and gave the sandwich a nice sour bite.  I prefer my fries extra crispy, so I was naturally disappointed with the sogginess that came with the cole slaw/fry combination.  I think I preferred the cappicola; it had a certain spiciness that the pastrami was lacking.  

Luckily I was able to finish the entire sandwich (proudly!).  Even though I expect to return to Pittsburgh at some point, I'm really glad I got the chance to try out Primanti's on this trip.  The sandwich wasn't the best I've ever had in my life, but it was satisfying and certainly unique."}
{"text":"Good Sandwich and a Great location. The server was a helpful guy that gave good guidance on what to order! This is a Pittsburgh cornerstone restaurant that I've heard about for years and I knew I had to try. I've read some of the reviews and the complainers who have all these petty complaints about not enough cheese or the sandwich being messy...give me a break and just head back to your high maintenance arugula chutney,free range vegan co-ops and have some Brie with your Naan! I only wish I could have had a beer but I had to head to work and fly to Miami. Good Stuff!"}

Primanti Bros is a Pittsburgh staple, and so I naturally had to stop in while I was visiting that area. We went to the Oakland location by the University of Pittsburgh. Unassuming outside and in, there is cramped seating on both the ground floor and a balcony area, as well as a bar. 

There were only 3 people working when I was there: one griller and two servers. It's a small place, but it was packed and could've used more help. That, or just have people walk up and order rather than waiter service for the seated patrons. While it was appreciated, it did make for slower service.

I had a bowl of chili ($3.29) that was delicious on a cold day and packed more of a kick than I would've expected. Unfortunately (and I know it's blasphemy), that was it for tasty food that I had. My sandwich was the most popular: the Pittsburgher Cheese Steak ($6.29). All sandwiches come with fries, coleslaw, and tomato right on the sandwich. It just wasn't that good.

There was no taste to it at all. The fries had zero salt on them. The coleslaw was bland. The cheese steak was just a mush of unflavored meat. The only saving grace: the Italian bread each sandwich is made with is great. Other than that, nothing.

If this weren't a famous Pittsburgh place I'd never have come. To be fair, it could be delicious drunk-food and they do serve alcohol. But for an actual meal, I'd never return."}
{"text":"My brother mentioned that he'd heard about this place in Pittsburgh that puts coleslaw and fries on their sandwiches. Sounded good and I was in town so I thought I'd give it a shot! I went around 4 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy! Usually a good sign. There were only about 3 people in front of me in the takeout line, so it shouldn't have taken long for me to place an order, right? Wrong. It took maybe 15-20 minutes for those 3 orders to be taken because nobody would commit themselves to working the register. While waiting in line, I got to see all these mouthwatering sandwiches being made. Once I placed my order, it didn't take long to come out...

So I got a Pittsburgh cheese steak, their #2 most popular item (don't ask what their #1 is...the guy will roll his eyes and unenthusiastically say, \"beer.\") Long story short, what I ended up with was a bland, lukewarm beef party with bland soggy fries on top. The cold lettuce and tomato cooled the sandwich even more. I enjoyed the coleslaw on top, which is pretty much all I ended up eating from the sandwich. And a few limp fries. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I hope I don't offend any people from Pittsburgh with this. It was a good sandwich, but more of a gimmick than I was expecting. One of the best things about it was when I asked the girl what the number one seller was, as they only listed the number two on the menu, she said it was beer. That's my type of place. I had seen this mentioned on several Food Network shows and since we were in town to watch the Cardinals vs the Bucs thought we'd give it a try. We've been there, we've tried it, that box is checked. Great place for the atmosphere so don't not go because of this review. The service was awesome, even with a very busy and boisterous crowd."}
{"text":"Heard about this place (Chain) from my boss-it was on Food Network.  Didn't feel like having their signature sandwiches, so ordered the loaded fries-got to me, they had run out of Jalapenos....so I had a chili laden boat of fries-fries were soggy and the dish was kind of .......meh.

Ordered the Pizza (Super deluxe) 14\" comes with five toppings.......supposedly $14.99 but they added $1.69 for each of the toppings.  The crust was thin and good, the toppings were so thin sliced as to be hardly noticeable.  

Just as a side note, when oyu're in a restaurant, no one outside your own party needs to hear about your tribulations and triumphs witht hose idiots who are your bosses....just sayin'.  We don't go out to dinner to listen to you in your overly loud voice, recount every grueling minute of your work week.  It's annoying."}
{"text":"After what turned into an all day struggle with Megabus getting to Pittsburgh, we finally arrived around 9:00PM on a Friday night. Hungry, and gross, we took our turns cleaning up in the hotel and got ready to go find some grub. Of course, Primanti Brothers was the first thing that was on my mind.

Upon arriving at the restaurant, which is hidden down an alley way that looks less than inviting late at night to those unfamiliar with the area, we chose our sandwich and began checking out the menu which was located on a giant board on the wall. Now, I have had a sandwich very similar to this in Chicago at Lucky's Sandwich Shop, so the idea of a sammy filled with french fries and coleslaw was nothing new to me.  However, I was anything but disappointed. After ordering, our food arrived promptly, hot, and was absolutely delicious. 

With plenty of sandwich choices, and an overall cheap menu, there is really very little to complain about when it comes to Primanti Brothers. If you find yourself in Pittsburgh, with some extra time and a hungry stomach, I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"No trip to the Steel City is complete without getting Primanti Bros. I was last here in 2011 and 5 years later I was still craving this place. I convinced my friends to walk to this place from our hotel which was a mile away. We got there at about 6 pm and there was no seating except for the bar. Lots of people and there was no way we could wait. We had not eaten since the morning and got lots of food. I got the pittsburger and some extra fries. I enjoyed every bite of it. My friends ordered more fries to my surprise. In no time, we were full but still wanted more. Ever sandwich comes with coleslaw, fries and tomatoes. They have lots of variations but at all times these sandwiches are stacked. 

Pros:
Great food, get extra fries along with the sandwich!
Great service
Customers and locals were all friendly at this place

Cons:
Chance you might have to wait but it is so worth it"}

{"text":"Omg I walked in just now to get something to go! The young girl pretty much ignored me! Never said hello!! Talk about rude!!"}
{"text":"I ordered online and my food was suppose to be ready in approximately 10 minutes. I arrived about 15 minutes later. It took about 5 minutes to be helped when I arrived. After I paid for my food I waited almost 20 more minutes or another way to put it about 30 minutes after it was suppose to be ready. So sorry for the wait or anything, the hostess just came up and handed me my bag of food. And no...the restaurant was not busy at all! I only saw two two tables in the dining area and three customers at the bar the entire time I was there. There was no excuse for the food to be ready 40 minutes later. I got the Pitts-burger which was only so-so. The fries were bland and the sandwich itself did not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"It's Primanti's, so it's like the thing to experience for the tourists because I guess putting fries on a gigantic burger is unique, but let's be honest, other than that, this place is just another corporate entity that is running off of nostalgia and the name value. Honestly, apart from the mountainous portions, it's not that much different from something you'd get at a fast food place.

So yeah, the beer is cheap if that's your thing (it's not mine), and the sandwiches are massive and filling, but there's better food to be had elsewhere in this great city."}
{"text":"This is a food MUST if you're visiting Pittsburgh for the first time. I love a good sammie and when there are fries inside of it? OH MY!! Major deliciousness. 

There's a variety of sandwich options: salami, roast beef, pastrami etc... but all of then have fries with a coleslaw salad inside. Most sandwiches are really inexpensive. Around $5-$7. The wings here are also really yummy. They aren't breaded but are pretty meaty. 

I love this location especially since there's plenty of parking and good for families. The inside is a typical dive bar. There's a bar in the middle where you can watch the Pens game or whatever sports game is on. There are larger tables/booths inside. 

It's not 'fine'' dining but definitely good food if you just want to grab a bite to eat at a casual restaurant. 

I ordered a sangria here and it was HUGE. However, the taste was just so-so. It felt like the ice watered down the wine too much. I wouldn't order cocktails here."}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are HUGE! I made the mistake of ordering separate fries completing forgetting that fries are inside the sammie.

The bread is fresh and flavorful without being overly oily. They're very generous with their meat portion of the sandwich.

It's the place to go if you're visiting Pittsburgh for the 1st time."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Primanti Bros in the city, I don't even have to order any more when I walk in they know what I want and get it going.  The quality of the sandwiches here are so good every time I go I feel like I just had the best sandwich of my life.  The staff is very nice and friendly.  Writing this review is making me hungry I think I might go here for lunch today."}
{"text":"Came here to watch Monday night Football.   No audio because the Pittsburgh penguins were playing.. So you think when the game was over they would switch the audio to the football game.... Nope,  juke box music.   If your looking to watch a football game go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Iconic, apparently. It was fine. I was glad they had a parking lot. We walked in and were told (via hand gesture) to seat ourselves. We sat down and ordered our sandwiches- I got bacon and cheese. The fries, coleslaw and tomato on top weren't bad, but it just wasn't as amazingly delicious as I expected for something undoubtedly so bad for you- I want my taste buds disco dancing and that just didn't happen. There are no utensils, and you grab paper towels from a roll on your table. Nothing wrong with this, but just know what you're in for. Service is not particularly friendly- not sure if this is a symptom of a place that's been around forever so they don't think they have to be nice, but whatever."}
{"text":"Delicious evening snack so filling yet low priced!!...Excellent Service..."}
{"text":"Big ass Sandwiches and very tasty. The cold slaw is delicious and made with no mayo. I do recommend. Great staff! Just add some more meat to sandwich and it gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"I  have been wanting to try this place for years.  On a recent trip for the Baltimore/Pittsburgh game, I got the chance.  Our 15 minute wait outside in the cold was well worth the time.  We were seated at the bar and and were served by a really funny bartender.  Of course we had to have Iron City Beer and the Pittsburgher. My sandwich (which came almost as soon as I ordered it) was everything that I expected.  Who wouldn't love fresh french fries on top of a hamburger served on thick Italian bread with tangy coleslaw?  It was HUGE and I only finished half of it.  My only complaint is the tomato- but hey, its November.  Who has good tomatoes in the north in November?  One thing to know- it is cash only, so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Was good the bread fresh corn beef was good. Would rather have sauerkraut  than the coleslaw. Be prepared you have to get the fries and coleslaw on your sandwich even if you don't like it. Would go back if ablock away but wouldn't  go cross city for it."}
{"text":"Delicious and over the top sandwiches that you should treat yourself to no more than twice a year 

My dad and I were visiting Pittsburgh and saw this place on every \"must eat in Pittsburgh\" list. So we went and ordered two of their most famous sandwiches: the Pitts burger and the New Yorker.

This place really lives up to the hype. Their sandwiches are ginormous... it's like the size of the my face. Each is piled with thick layers of meat, cheese and FRIES. 

Both sandwiches had the same base- thick white bread, fries, coleslaw, cheese, and onions (by request). The bread was very average. I thought it tasted a little dry actually... the fries were a bit too much, it overpowered the sandwich a bit. I LOVED the coleslaw. It's one of the best coleslaws I've tasted in a sandwich. It added a nice sour and crisp kick to the sandwiches, and it's crisp texture really cuts through the rest of the otherwise soft sandwich. The pitts burger had a very average beef patty as the meat, while the New Yorker had corned beef and pastrami, as well as some mustard. There is so much stuff in each of the sandwiches that the bottom pieces of bread literally got flattened before we even picked it up. 

Honestly, I think that the taste of the sandwiches are themselves 4/5, but the presentation and service at the place gives it a solid 4.5.

The service was very fast - our sandwiches were served in 10-15 min. The staff is very friendly! The presentation of the sandwiches is very good - They are cut in half and served on parchment paper. The sandwiches are very photogenic and perfect for instagram/Snapchat/Yelp or any other social media platforms."}
{"text":"We ordered the original \"Pittsburgher\" and the \"Capp and Cheese\" (cappicola and provolone). The sandwiches were average. Not exactly bursting with flavor in the same way they were bursting at the seams with french fries, but decent. Probably a whole lot better as a reasonable, late night meal to soak up some alcohol than for a sober lunch."}
{"text":"I had eaten at a number of Primanti's location around Pittsburgh, but this past weekend was my first stop at the shop in Oakland.  I found the sandwiches at this location to be more generous (more slaw, more fries, etc) than at the suburban shops.  Everyone in my party of five thought the same thing, and the quality was as good or better than other Primanti's I have eaten at.

Service, on the other hand, was lacking a little bit.  While the server was attentive to the point of getting our meals to us, after that we were on our own.  After waiting about 15 minutes for our check, the cook behind the counter was gladly willing to check us out when I asked.  

Note that this location does not accept credit cards, and we had to use the ATM in the building lobby because the PNC ATM up the block was out of order.  Bring cash!

The quality of the food and the college-town ambiance helped ensure the 4-star rating, even though the service was a bit lackluster."}
{"text":"I came in and asked the guy behind the counter to serve up two sandwiches of whatever he thought best represented this place.  He picked pastrami and corned beef (both obviously served with french fries and coleslaw on top).

The pastrami was pretty tasty.  The cool coleslaw, warm pastrami, and salty fries all worked together.  It didn't blow my mind, but it was a decent sandwich.  However, the corned beef sandwich didn't seem to have much flavor at all--at least compared to the pastrami.

It was nice that they at least have a private lot for parking."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's Primanti's, no pretension or aspiration to be anything more or less. Granted it's been 20+/- years since I was in college and last ate at Primanti's it was almost surreal how almost pedestrian the flavors were in my unaltered state of consciousness as opposed to my hyper-vigilant recollect. Oh well, still good and a great time! Thanks guys and keep it up!  Cash only boys and girls, don't spend all your cash"}
{"text":"This is probably a great place to go to when it's late at night and you're drunk, but I wasn't when I went. The fries were soggy and tasted slightly burnt, the roast beef with cheese was okay, and my boyfriend had to put ketchup on his sirloin steak and cheese because it tasted bland. I also thought the bread was too thick and the coleslaw wasn't flavorful enough. It sounds like I'm completely bashing this place, but it's a place to get a quick bite with cheap prices. The workers are also super chill and you really can't hate them."}
{"text":"CAP EGG AND CHEESE!   PLEASE!!
If your from the burgh you already understand.  Original shop in the strip is where you need to go.  Get the real feel of night life after the bars let out and dem folks are hungry.  YES. MAY I HAVE ANOTHER!!"}
{"text":"We came from California in the search of this famous sandwich! It did not fail to impress us. It was fast and inexpensive but so delicious! Staff tried their best to get around to everyone but they were bust both times that we came in. It was worth it though and will be back if we are ever back in town."}
{"text":"A LEGEND. Ok, who does not love greasy fries in a burger sandwich. It's the ultimate fat kid's dream - I know it was mine when I was little haha :P 

So the thing is, it's pretty good, but not really memorable - after the first few bites, it's a little bland. The burger meat is decent but not tender, juicy, moist (etc) and the fries were underwhelming. The slaw is pretty good but just overall execution, was ok. 

Service however, is ON POINT. 

Am I deterring you from coming? On the contrary, you should visit for its local flavor - but split the sandwich to share to stuff yourself with something tasty later on."}
{"text":"Food okay service at the bar not so much. It was busy but after being served a beer I was ignored for far too long while trying to order food. The people on each side of me were served twice. Finally I went to hostess and ordered from her   Ironically then the woman behind the bar asked me if I needed anything (my beer had been empty for 5 minutes at that point as well)."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, festive atmosphere and good service. My kielbasa sandwich was great with the combination of fries, cole slaw, provolone and tomatoes it made quite a sandwich. My wife's pastrami was also excellent. It's easy to understand why this is a thriving local chain not to be missed."}
{"text":"Talking bad about Primantis to a Pittsburgher is like hitting on our little brother or sister, we aren't going to take it kindly.  

This location is a artery of Pittsburgh's food scene.  When we come home from vacation, we go to Primanti's.  When friends come home from war, We go to Primanti's.  When someone visits us and asks to take them somewhere to eat, We go to Primanti's.

You gotta be one unhappy individual to not want any sandwich of your choosing on fresh cut Mancini's Italian Bread topped with fresh cut french fries and cole slaw (tomatoes are your choice).  They have arguably one of the best fish sandwich's you can get any day and time of the week.  They are 24/7 and if you eat the same sandwich 10 times the consistency is that it will be the same, ALL-10-TIMES.

I like the fish but I also like their Pastrami and Corned Beef.  My friend raves about the capicola as well as the loaded cheese fries.

Dine with your family on one side or stumble in pissy drunk for that late night fix on the other side just whatever you do, cash only.

Tell them HITTofMCM's sent ya!"}
{"text":"I'm from Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh people eat Primantis.  Pittsburgh people value their Primantis.  Some people don't get it.  End of story."}
{"text":"I only had one meal in Pittsburgh, and I was told by many friends (and confirmed by the Internet as I don't trust my friends) that I should eat here.  And eat here I did.

I read about the history of this joint, and you can't help but respect it.  Started from humble beginnings, and the interesting sandwich combo was developed from the start (as opposed to being a recent gimmick).  It's humble and simple.

Got the Pittsburgher (their acclaimed #2 seller, which I realized was somewhat of a joke as their #1 seller is Iron City beer).  Also doubled down and got cheese fries.  I think I gained 4 lbs just from looking at my food, and another couple after downing just half of it.

The burger had a pretty lame patty sandwiched in their typical fashion --- italian bread, cole slaw, French fries, tomato, and provolone.  But it just didn't work.  Too much starch, not enough saltiness, and hard to distinguish flavors between each other.  The cheese fries were OK, but nothing special.

At the end of the day I'm glad I ate here.  It's a \"cultural\" experience and one has to respect this establishment's history and how the locals pride themselves in the sandwich.  It's not my cup of tea, but if you're going to Pittsburgh and want to eat a piece of history (does that even make sense???), you should come here."}
{"text":"We were passing Pittsburgh on our way to Canada and asked a friend from Pittsburgh where we should stop for lunch.  She told us the history of Primanti Brothers and we thought it sounded great.  If this is traditional Pittsburgh food that has been around for close to 100 years than the food scene in Pittsburgh is sad.  The cheeseburger sandwich was a dried out, overcooked brown disc that looked like a frozen Salisbury steak patty without the gravy.  The bread was soft and immediately got soggy from the cole slaw.  The coleslaw was watery and bland; the fries were cold, undercooked, limp, soggy, and had no seasoning or flavor.  My teenage sons will eat absolutely anything and even they thought it was disgusting!  We were starving and short on time so we ate and left after clearing up the confusion over the bill.  They hand you a handwritten ticket with no prices or total on it and she tried to charge us $55 initially.  When my husband questioned the amount she fixed it to the correct $42.  Honest mistake or padding her tip in this 'cash only' establishment?  The area around The Strip where Primanti Bros. is located was dirty and depressing as well.  I can't imagine why anyone would go to Pittsburgh, or why anyone could find that nasty, bland food appealing.  The worst food experience of our lives.  But hey, we have a funny story out if it."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is an institution.  There is absolutely no argument from me there.  I've seen them on Man vs Food, other Travel Channel types of food shows, etc.  It's a very well known place and I was looking forward to going there.  This is not their \"main\" location but it was the most convenient location to where I was staying in Pittsburgh.  I've had other types of \"overstuffed\" sandwiches before and I've always seemed to enjoy them.  

I arrived and it's set up pretty much like any other chain type of restaurant (i.e. hostess stand when you walk in, dining room to your right, and bar/additional dining area to your left).  I grabbed a booth and was happy to see they had TV's everywhere.  It's definitely a sports themed type of place.  This would definitely be a good place to catch a game.  They have phenomenal happy hour prices throughout the week and seem to have a different special just about every day of the week.

I knew I was getting a sandwich but I wasn't sure which one I was going with.  I debated between the Roast Beef and cheese and the pastrami and cheese.  Then, the waitress came over and told me a lot of people had been ordering the \"When Pigs Fly\" sandwich which was a new one.  It was turkey, ham and bacon complete with all the other fixings.  I didn't read on the menu that it also contained a fried egg.  I'm not a fan of fried eggs on lunch or dinner types of sandwiches, like a burger, for example.  I decided to go with the When Pigs Fly.

Major props to Primanti's because the sandwich was served quickly.  It's two thick slices of bread, the turkey, ham, bacon, tomato, cole slaw and french fries...and the fried egg.  Again, I was not a huge fan of the fried egg on the sandwich.  The sandwich also needed some type of dressing or sauce as it was a little on the drier side.  I decided to use some ketchup at the end.  I liked the sandwich but it was not life changing.  As an FYI, there's not a ton of meat.  There's a lot of fillers but I did particularly like the cole slaw.  It was more lettuce as it was not mayo based.  It was a vinegar based cole slaw which was cool.  I also liked the french fries that came on the sandwich.  

Overall, I definitely liked the sandwich and it was pretty reasonably priced at about $9 or so.  If you're in Pittsburgh, I think you need to come here for the experience.  Service was fast and friendly throughout."}
{"text":"Man. This was our second try at this location, the first being The day after St. Patrick's this year. Our son goes to school out here and we have been trying to enjoy local flavor, but this place just doesn't do it for me. I had the pittsburger last time and thought all I could taste was cole slaw, which, while good, didn't allow for any other flavors. Thought we would try again today and had a disappointing visit. To start, We specifically went during a steelers game, as as expected, the place was packed. This was what we wanted, locals!! But sadly, it became very apparent that this location couldn't handle the capacity. The women's toilet overflowed and the bathroom floor was wet, the men's bathroom stunk.  The music was too loud to hear the game, our server was friendly enough but she was swamped and we could tell. We were probably there 2 hours and by the time she realized we needed a second beer, we were 10 minutes from being handed the check. The food was hit and miss. Our chili cheese fries came fast and were disgustingly awesome, but that was the highlight. We waited a half hour for our main meals - pittsburger (son says was great), cheeseburger (husband unimpressed and fries were cold) buffalo chicken burger (they forgot the bleu cheese and the buffalo sauce is sweet!?) a kids cheeseburger that didn't get finished (although she raved about the Dole cup of peaches that she said were \"so Fresh!!\"... She's 6) and my buffalo wing salad... Eh. Iceberg lettuce, a handful of tomatoes, onions, cucumber... Very basic. Not in love with the sweet buffalo chicken. I mean, just not anything to write home about. Inadequate staffing on game day, gross bathrooms, sub par food, it only gets two stars for the chili fries and the pittsburger. Going elsewhere next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Second time here just as disappointing as first. Fries stone cold the bread is pretty dry and there are 3 to 4 other tables here.  We have now been waiting for 15 Min on a remake with a 3 year old it's the worst we are never leaving here"}
{"text":"If Pittsburgh has a food staple, this is probably it. First of all, it's always a pleasure to drink a Yeungling when I travel east. And after getting up at 2 am to catch 2 flights, a 23 ounce mug of this classic lager definitely hit the spot. For my sandwich, I ordered the Pittsburgher, their second biggest seller. I love the vinegar slaw and the bright color and flavor of the tomatoes. Those fries are definitely fresh. The only thing I didn't care for was the burger itself. The beef not only got overwhelmed by the other ingredients, but it just did not taste like fresh beef. 

The total came to around $16, more than reasonable. I would still return when I visit, but I'd opt for a different sandwich."}
{"text":"This was my first Pittsburgh sandwich experience. It was 10am, and my friends and I were looking for a breakfast spot to help us cure a collective post-wedding hangover. The sandwiches they have are not really geared towards breakfast (ie lots of deli meats or fish), but we decided to give Primanti's a try. I ordered the egg sandwich, and it was decent but didn't have a whole lot of flavor, so I had to douse it in hot sauce. All sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw in the bun...the friends I was with didn't tell me this before we ordered because they didn't want me to embarrass them and ask for the fries on the side. It was an interesting combo, but I preferred to take most of the fries off of my sandwich and eat them on the side. Overall, my friends and I felt that the sandwiches were a little heavy and greasy, but they hit the spot."}
{"text":"I've been to the original Primanti's in The Strip, as well as other chain Primanti's restaurants. If you're looking for an experience like what you'll get in The Strip, this is not the place. If you're looking for one of the cleaner, well laid out Primanti's chain restaurants, this is it. I'm not going to review what is so unique about Primanti's. Google it. However, in regards to this establishment, the servers were pleasant (we came in with a large party), accommodating, and quick. The food was fresh and presented nicely. I would choose to go to this Primanti's over the other two I've frequented in the past."}
{"text":"Okay so I will forever be a fan and will make this a stop every time I'm in PA! The service was laid back but attentive and that pastrami Sammie fully loaded was utter nirvana :) such a cool staple for Pittsburg and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really didn't think I'd like the coleslaw in my sandwich, but they really made a good case for it. I'd gladly have another here in fact. The flavour was balanced and not overly sour like I thought. Actually ended up pairing very well with the meat and french fries in the sandwich, adding some crunch and refreshing quality to the whole thing.

Happy and friendly service in a loud and lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Being from the Pittsburgh area, I do love my Primanti Bros. sandwiches. However, my experience this past weekend at the Mt. Lebo location was not the best. We went on a Friday night around 8:30. It seemed pretty busy but we got seated right away. My boyfriend and I ordered a beer and our sandwiches. I always get capicola with cheese. You can't go wrong. But when our sandwiches came out they were not hot. They were only slightly warm. I didn't say anything, though, since I was really hungry and just wanted to eat and get home. The sandwich itself still tasted good but it would have been a lot better if it came out hot. The service was okay, nothing special, nothing terrible. But I'm not sure if I will be back to this location since I have had better experiences at the other locations."}
{"text":"First of all I've never had a bad sandwich from here!  Yes I understand people hate cash only and don't like how crowded it is but it will remain a staple of Pittsburgh. It's more than the fries on top that make this a great sandwich, it's the bread and premium meats cooked fresh that make them great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were passing through Pittsburgh on a road trip. We had seen TV shows featuring primanti brothers sandwiches. They looked amazing on TV.  And we were really excited about them. However when we got to primanti brothers and received our sandwiches (I got the roast beef and he got the pittsburger) we realized there was hardly ANY MEAT on the sandwich. Or cheese for that matter. It was overloaded with coleslaw that we could hardly taste the meat. The pittsburger burger that came in the sandwich was so small that it was only towards the middle of the sandwich. Very over rated place. And the area near the bathrooms smelled like a pet store."}
{"text":"I realize it's a sandwich shop and I dared to order a salad - but their menu is limited - so why put something on it if you're not going to do it right? Ordered a grilled chicken salad, take out. Got back to the hotel and found it had a pile of tasteless, cold french fries on it...so cold they never melted the shredded orange cheese-food underneath them. Also no salt or ketchup was included, so even if I DID want to eat stone cold, unseasoned fries, they would suck. The balsamic dressing I ordered was replaced by (fake) raspberry vinaigrette, so repulsive it required a trip all the way back  to the restaurant to get the correct dressing, which they were out of. Would have been nice to have been asked, since they did have Italian on hand - seems like a closer match. The iceberg lettuce, olive, and tomato salad, oh yeah, it did have a bit of chicken on it too, was okay once I scraped all that orange congealed \"cheese\" off.  That and all the smokers hanging around the place (and Pittsburgh in general), I would say this place is a totally over-rated dump."}
{"text":"Drooltastic. Visited here back on September 22nd with two newly-made friends whose house in Lawrenceville I'd just CouchSurfed at (yeah, I know, but it ended up being totally fine and a lot of fun). I had the standard Angus steak sandwich thing that comes with fries inside. Very good, very unhealthy, very likely to have it again next time :-)"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh style chili was very spicy and had a distinct ketchup taste (Heinz I assume).  Fried zucchini was good, but I had better at the Micro Diner in Mount Washington the day before.

The sandwiches they are known for are just weird.  I got the Pitts-burgher sandwich, apparently the #2 best seller on the menu (Server said #1 was IC Beer).  The meat patty that was in that sandwich was a Salisbury steak patty.  I am not joking.  That gray, rubbery, dense, unmistakable taste took me right back to 6th grade school lunch and ruined anything that may have been good about the sandwich.  Game over from the first bite.  It was awful.  For god's sake, use a real beef patty.

Also tried a pastrami and cheese sandwich.  First off, the sandwiches are huge, and with all the toppings, very difficult to get a bite of everything at once.  When you do, the fries and coleslaw really overpower everything else (except  Salisbury steak). The pastrami was extremely tender, too tender, almost to the point of mushy, and it was very very bland.  It got completely lost.  The texture of the meat and the bottom piece of bread were one in the same, almost pasty.     

The décor was what you would expect and the service was very good, but the food was just disappointing.  I think you have to try it to say that you have, but it's not worth another try."}
{"text":"Thinking of reasons to go to Pittsburgh just so I can have a pastrami sandwich from here. When I was in Pittsburgh I hit this place up twice. This place deserves nothing but 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"With about 500 reviews what can I say that is not already here? Nothing. The food is amazing. This is a must do for tourists and visitors while in Pittsburgh. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The wife and I usually come here several times a month, mostly for their happy hour. The food is very good and the drink specials can't be beat. Unfortunately there is one issue that management needs to address. One of the regular bartenders apparently BATHES in perfume. All of the bartenders, including this one, are very good but the overpowering perfume chases us out every time. Someone PLEASE ask her to tone it down, we really like the place but not when it smells like a bingo game at the local senior center."}
{"text":"The \"manager\" at this location is so arrogant and ignorant that my family and I will not patronize this or any other any Primanti Brothers restaurant again. The bartender was a very sweet and friendly girl who couldn't have been nicer. We had a couple beers and ordered sandwiches, having a few laughs with the bartender who had time to B.S. because we were literally the only customers in the bar! (We know why now). When our food came, the bread on my sandwich was hard, as if it had been sliced early in the day and left out. The other two sandwiches were fine. I brought it to the attention of the bartender, she apologized and returned it to the kitchen. We shared a laugh about it, no big deal. A few minutes later, out comes the \"manager\" with my new sandwich. He tells me that there was nothing wrong with the sandwich that I sent back! I couldn't believe that he really wanted to debate the issue! I bit my tongue out of respect for my family but this experience will not be forgotten.
How foolish for Primanti's to lose steady customers because of poor management decisions."}
{"text":"Without the fries and slaw,  you have burnt little offerings with barely and cheese and two tiny tomatoes... order a jack and coke from the bar and you might get a \"splash\" of alcohol in it...  TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED... forget asking for seperate checks"}
{"text":"I take personal offense that this is seen as the defacto Pittsburgh experience. Why?  There's so much better out there.  What drives me insane is that my hometown Grove City, now has a Primanti's (where you can get the \"Pittsburgh experience\" if you're so agoraphobic and/or lost your license due to too many DUI's to take the 50 minute drive to the actual city where Primanti's came from).  I honestly think the sheen has worn off of this place though with the emergence of more praise-worthy options.  I know I sound like an obnoxious blowhard, but I have the truth on my side (and you know it, 64 year old retired truck driver from Braddock who is currently on their 14th Budlight while reading this review in their local library).  Sorry, I grew up poor, this isn't a class issue.  

WOW EVERYBODY....THE FRIES ARE ON THE SANDWICH...WOWWW, NOW I CAN BROWSE MYSPACE (another outdated institution) WHILE GETTING OUT OF BREATH BECAUSE USING YOUR THUMBS IS HARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRD.

The restaurant in and of itself is perfecty adequate.  But why the mythology?  We don't need to brag about it anymore.  Primanti's represents Pittsburgh now about as well as General Tso's represents China's military history.  MAKE PITTSBURGH GREAT AGAIN and stop Primanti's from riding the coattails of it's resurgence!

IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  The Mike Love-led Beach Boys.  No one should care about them anymore, their best days with Brian Wilson are behind them."}
{"text":"OK this place is world-famous known for putting french fries on sandwiches on Thursdays they have family night, you get feed your whole family for just 20 bucks in this day and time tell me where that's possible OK maybe at McDonald's but this is quality food..."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches which will keep you full for a long time. When in Rome,do as the Romans do! 

Only downside, if you order a dill pickle with your sandwich, it comes sliced in fourths! Who pre slices a whole dill pickle?!?!"}
{"text":"From what I understand, the kitsch of this place it to be rude and have a bad attitude towards customers.  If I would have understood that before I went, maybe I would have been a little easier on the place.  

I'm from northwestern PA, and over Christmas, my boyfriend and I flew back to my parents for Christmas from Denver.  Having never been to Pittsburgh, and being the foodie that he is, he knew he wanted to go to the original Primanti Bros. 

I personally like the sandwich- give this Irishwoman corned beef any day.  Add some coleslaw and cram some fries between two slices of Italian bread, and I'm satisfied (and a few pounds heavier).  I like the history behind the sandwich- truck drivers who needed something quick to pick up and didn't have time to eat, got all ingredients wrapped in a paper and could be on their way.   

It was really the atmosphere that threw me off.  Call me overly-sensitive, but when I go out to eat, I'd rather not feel like I'm a nuisance to your establishment and a bother for you to serve.  Maybe living out west has softened me, but you can expect that any server out here, whether they be working at a sub shop or upscale restaurant, will ask you about your day and joke around with you 99% of the time. So I was unprepared for the next hour that unfolded.    

When we arrived, the two of us were directed to a large booth in the corner that could have sat at least 6 people.  Everyone, and I mean everyone- from the manager to the servers- were rolling their eyes and giving us dirty looks for sitting in such a large booth, but that is where we were told to sit.  Finally they made us move to a smaller table, and after we asked if we were causing a problem, the waitress stated, \"Just forget it, whaddya wanna order?\" Seriously, we overheard several waitresses barking to their tables and rolling their eyes to patrons while making snarky remarks.  One girl at the table next to us was just making a statement that she loved when the fries first came out because they're so fresh....and the waitress rolled her eyes and huffed, \"Oh, well then I'll make sure to get right on that, huh?!\" nastily.  Yikes. 

You better know what you want immediately, because this is a \"hurry-up-and-order, so you can gobble-down-your-food and get-the-hell-out\" kind of place.  They really make you feel like you're wasting their precious time there.  I get it!! You have a lot of people to serve during your lunch rush- So do about 1,000,000 other restaurants, yet those places can do it graciously and make it appear effortless.  So we ordered quickly, the food came quickly, and we were eh. satisfied. 

That's when the daunting \"CASH ONLY\" sign reared its ugly face.  Both of us rely on our debit cards and rarely carry cash.  Our eyes widened at the thought of what might happen.....Would they: A) Make us wash dishes?,Or, the more obvious option, B) Murder us right then and there? The ol' luck of the Irish saved my tail and there turned out to be an ATM inside.  We were saved.  After withdrawing a $20, we got our tab- which was only about $14.  

We slunk up to the counter to pay.  The rudest waitress of all grabbed our check and $20 from us.  She gave us about $6 and some change.  I believe in leaving at least some amount of tip, no matter how bad the service is; because the waitress could have been a bad day, the poor service could have been someone else's fault, etc.  So as we go to hand back a few of the dollars, the waitress ripped and i mean RIPPED the remaining $6 out of our hands for the tip and sarcastically said, \"Thanks!\"  I certainly didn't want the tip money to go to her, as our main waitress was \"friendlier,\" if that's what you can call it.  

Go here because you can't get the original sandwich anywhere else.  Go here because when checking out a new city, it would be atrocious to go to a boring chain restaurant, and it's always great to see what local places a city has to offer.    

All-in-All, know what to expect when you go here: 
1) Don't waste space at the table you sit at 
2) Order quickly and act like a pro 
3) Know that there are better sandwich places out there 
4) Know you're going for the experience, for the inventive sandwich and the establishment's less-than-pleasant attitude and charm
5) BRING CASH!"}
{"text":"My trip to New York was delayed by a powerful blizzard that rocked the East Coast in December. I landed in Pittsburgh by accident, only hope was to take the flight to Pittsburgh and drive back to New York. We met up with my GF sister, she was vacationing in Pittsburgh at the time, decided to take us to Primanti Bros. Let me tell you the hype on Food Network is TRUE! I tried the Cappicola with eggs and it was seriously the best sandwich i ate in my life! The Italian bread was moist, had the perfect texture, the provolone cheese was fresh and mouthwatering, coleslaw had this addicting cider vinegary tangy taste to it, and the seasoned fries complimented the meat, coleslaw, and bread perfectly. I chased it all down with the local Iron City beer. I recently was told by a friend that San Francisco has a joint that is similar called Giordano Bros. I will have to give that a try soon!"}
{"text":"Came to town on business, and everyone kept talking about this place. I looked it up on google and found out its pretty popular. Well my fellow yelpers, I'm a fan, great atmosphere, came in on football Saturday, order the colossal fish sandwich and it was excellent, if you're in the area it's worth checking out,"}
{"text":"Unique place that has passed the test of time.  Good food and fries.  One question, would it be too much to ask the high school kid preparing my food to wear gloves if he is going to squeeze everything I eat between his fingernails?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places in the world!  Thick sliced white bread with your choice of deli meat (I had turkey) along with cheese and cole slaw AND FRENCH FRIES on the sandwich all served on butcher paper!  So delicious.  Be prepared to wait on line during peak hours, but the turnover is fairly quick and worth it!  Definitely a must try in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Yes! Loved this place! Both hot sandwiches we got were delicious! Jalapeño poppers were a no-go for me though. This particular location was very nice, atmosphere relaxed and many things to do in this area!"}
{"text":"First time ever in Pittsburg and had to have Primanti Bros. Sandwich was awesome! (Cheesesteak) and a tall Yuengling to go with. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Fun place. We attacked this joint with a wedding after party without notice. They handled the crowd including the regular Saturday night action very well! 
This place was packed and although we arrived in a mass, they were still very attentive to our needs and requests. Also, drink orders came very fast! How do they do that?! Apparently with lots of experience! 
The pizzas were a great addition to our drinks and very quick staff. 
The prices?! Amazing! We partied like a rock-star and got a bill suited for the standard Joe! yay! I really appreciated the level of detail and attention they gave through the busy crazy time and atmosphere as well as food quality, speed, and overall service.

There was just the right amount of music volume and all the right alcohol available. Well stocked, well experienced, and well staffed. A great combo for a good time. Thank you for the experience!"}
{"text":"This place is known for their sandwiches that are served with fries on them. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was very good. The server was very friendly. I would definitely recommend checking this place out. The sandwiches are very big so it can be messy trying to eat them. Also, order a sauce for your sandwich because they don't come with one and I ended up using the ketchup at my table."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's finest.  Very old-fashioned atmosphere, not very big, but it's famous for a good reason:  it's bangin."}
{"text":"Of the Primanti's I've been to, this is the worst. I want to like it because I live within walking distance, but I'm routinely disappointed. The food is bad, the service is worse. During a recent visit the waiter messed up something for everyone in our party. My wife and I were with another couple and their children, and he forgot to bring (put in the order?) for one of the children, on top of numerous other mishaps. I'd chalk it up to a new waiter if this didn't happen almost every time I go in there. Last night the bartender was flat out rude. If this Primanti's stays open I'd be shocked."}
{"text":"We were here for an hour and a half before we got our food. We waited for the manager for 30 minutes. Will not come back. The manager was not helpful and blamed it on them being busy. Have gotten sat and served downtown faster."}
{"text":"Despite its godly reputation, I am only ever moderately impressed with Primanti Bros- Pittsburgh sin, I know. The food is standard: It's greasy and delicious. There are french fries in your sandwich. If you are new to town I highly recommend checking it out- the beer is some of the most inexpensive in Pittsburgh and the service is friendly. Make sure you try the Smallman Street Fries."}
{"text":"A heaping sandwich with meats, cole slaw, and fries packed between 2 slices of bread. Send your hunger running, or stop your blood from running....."}
{"text":"The wife & I were in town for a concert this past weekend. While my wife was taking a nap, I decided to find a place to have a pint. I came across Primanti Bros. The place is small but there are two floors. I bellied up to the bar and ordered a large draft of Yuengling Lager. I decided to order some food since Primanti Bros. is \"famous\". I asked the very nice waitress what is the most popular sandwich and she recommended the  The Pitts-burger. I think it's a  steak burger with fries, tomato & cole slaw on Italian bread. It was ok, nothing special. It was a rather large sandwich so you got your moneys worth. I think my bill came to about $14 for two large drafts and the sandwich so the value is good.  If your in town, try it just because it's Primanti Bros. Me? I would go back but been there done that so I will find another landmark restaurant next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Thanks to the great reviews on Yelp, I found this restaurant.  I got a Pitts-Burger cheese steak for $7.79a and it was wonderful.  The service was great and friendly.  I was upset that I only went one time, I wanted to explore the diverse menu and get more food from here."}
{"text":"While I prefer the scene at the original location in the Strip District, this one it pretty dang nice too. Regardless of the location, you cannot go wrong with any of the iconic Primanti Bros sandwiches. It's a Pittsburgh institution and if you are visiting, do yourself a favor and get to the nearest spot and order yourself up a sandwich. I recommend the cappicola, the bologna or the new HBK (Ham, Bacon, Kielbasa) named after the Penguins players."}
{"text":"I thought it was solid.  I got the Pittsburgher with an Iron City.  I had to experience Primanti and I enjoyed it.  
Service was good on a Friday afternoon, Beer was cold on a hot day and my sandwich was satisfying.  What more could you really ask for from a sandwich joint?"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about this place anymore. They once had a purpose for The Working Man back at the turn of the 1900s. Now it's just stereotypical Pittsburgh food. Can't say I've ever go back can't recommend that you ever go there in the first place. If you want fries and slaw and your sandwich you can do that at your own house."}
{"text":"The worst sandwich I have ever had.  Ordered the Pittsburger(their second best seller).  It didn't say what their best seller was.  Didn't want everything piled on the sandwich so I got fries on the side.  Also didn't want coleslaw piled on but the waitress told me \"that's what we do. It's delicious.\"  So I said ok.  My meal came on a piece of paper.  There was a pile of Cole slaw the size of my fist (literally)piled on top.  A pile of greasy, limp, undercooked fries was thrown next to my sandwich on the greasy piece of paper.  I ordered a Diet Coke and a very small cup (no more than 6 or 8 ounces) without ice was supplied.  I took a bite and all I could taste was vinegar coleslaw. I removed all of the coleslaw with my fingers(no silverware in sight) and took a bite of the burger.  Again, all I could taste was coleslaw that had oozed into the bread and \"burger\".  Took a bite of the burger alone, which was very small, and there was virtually NO TASTE!!.  I was chewing on something but there was absolutely no taste(other than some more coleslaw vinegar.  My bill for me and my girlfriend came to just under $22.00.  So I got a coleslaw sandwich(I ate less than half of it) with some greasy, limp, undercooked fries, with a very, very small beverage for $11.00.  I AM NOT A FAN!!  Will never return Pittsburgh icon to not."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. Everything was amazing! Loved the atmosphere. Prices were awesome. Staff was nice and respectful. I'd go there every day if I could."}
{"text":"1st trip here and LOVED IT!  A must eat if you're visiting Pittsburgh!!!  Fresh, Tasty, I had Kielbasa and Cheese!  The Kielbasa was just right and not over powering, the sandwich was awesome!"}
{"text":"I honestly loved the sandwich I got from Primanti Bros. Maybe it's because I love carbs or maybe it's because I was starving, but it had everything I was looking for in a sandwich. Good amount of meat and other ingredients, fluffy bread, reasonable price. I was visiting downtown Pittsburgh for a conference so I asked for their most popular sandwich, which was the pastrami ($7.39). The sandwich definitely did not disappoint. Pastrami sandwiches tend to be pretty salty, but this wasn't too salty at all. Loved the coleslaw they included. It wasn't the creamy type so the sandwich didn't end up soggy. I was surprised they included fries in the sandwich, but hey, it worked for me so I'm not complaining! I only wished I ate it there since the bread looked so fluffy and mine was smushed by the time I got back to my hotel. It was still tasty though. Would definitely go back if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"Whenever I happen to be in Pittsburgh, I would come by to this great place for lunch.

The sandwiches are HOT! Whether it is steak & cheese, or fish & cheese, or even hot sausages and cheese, man, it is ALL good. With literally a pile of tasty french fries and sauerkraut like cold slaw in the middle, the sandwich is huge, all for under $6. Add a local Yuengling beer (America's oldest and best brewery) if you like.

If the sandwich is too much for you to handle, take a stroll at the tri-state park.

The place is usually very busy at lunch time, with waitresses hustling around, wearing store T-shirt knotted around the waist, dashing in and out (since they do have outdoor tables). On the back of their T's, there is a vivid picture of the gigantic sandwich. When they turn around, you just cannot help notice their boobs too. I guess the sandwiches are as attractive as nice boobs :-)

A drooling place. Period."}
{"text":"I'd like to thank Primanti Brothers for finally giving me my official stance on a controversial opinion I've believed for years...

..when they put french fries right on the sandwich it SUCKS. It always sucks. It always will suck. This place is suppose to be the best at it and its just not very good. People need to stop this \"emperors new clothing\" of French Fries on a sandwich being anything but a poorly executed gimmick.

The thing about French Fries is that they are starchy and flaky. I would assume the reason they became a popular side dish is because they are a good palette cleanser. You eat a french fry and then all the tastes of your main course is fresh in your mouth again.

Now, I expected Primanti Brothers to be different because they are supposedly the best. But I found their fries bland and undercooked. I got the steak and egg sandwich and I had to cover the whole thing with salt, hot sauce and ketchup. Then the sandwich was ok.

I will say the bread they use on the sandwich was great. Too bad they have to ruin their sandwiches with this idea that French Fries in the sandwich is a good thing. Its a gimmick and it stinks. Its as bad as bacon with desserts.


2 notes. 1st, this is the original location so you can't tell me that another location does it better. 2nd, someone told me that they are made to be eaten drunk at 4am. However, Gold Star Chili is good while drunk at 4am too. Proves nothing."}
{"text":"Best damn Sandwiches, This place is PRIME! I could eat here everyday. Anyone who says these arent that great or anything special, doesnt know food. I get the kajun Chicken with Egg plus i add some hot sauce then with all the droppings that are left over I soak it in their malt vinegar and top it with salt. I love everything about Primantis. Dont cheat yourself, treat yourself"}
{"text":"I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha."}
{"text":"Primantis is one of my favorite restaurants. I love their sandwiches and appetizers. The only reason this location is getting 3 stars is because the service is terrible. I've been here a few times now and they mess up food, aren't very attentive, etc. I'm hoping they get better staff over time."}
{"text":"This food is over rated. It's only popular because they never close. Fries cold and bland a little salt wouldn't hurt. I'm a chef myself so this was very disappointing. My wife said we would have been off at a fast food drive thru. And they have deserts and chicken wings on the online menu but they didn't have them in the actual restaurant saying everyone isn't the same. Smh"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm glad I took her advice! The service was lovely, we had a very nice and friendly server. The sandwich my husband and i both got was the Pitts - burger, a hamburger patty served with a pile of slaw and fries on white bread (house made I suspect). It was a good sandwich, nothing to write home about, tho. The ambiance is super casual and fun, great for a dinner before heading out for a night on the town. Recommended if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Fries and cole slaw in the sandwich was interesting...pretty good. Don't come here if you don't like messy food. My sandwich kind of fell apart. Also, they don't give you plates or forks or knives (they bring you your food on a sheet of wax paper). I'm not sure if they take credit cards (we paid with cash), and have fun trying to find parking near it!"}
{"text":"i was here for work and ordred the #2  The cheesesteak was nice and square and stuff.  Hmm not sure if that's a good thing?  The combination of coleslaw and fries plus that really nice thick spongy bread was pretty good.  I would actually say this would be more like a 4 star sandwich but I have a deep seeded hatred for the Steelers so yeah whatever.  I'd like to see a sandwich superbowl, Seattle vs Pittsburgh yeah!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends while in the area. Heard it was a famous place in Pittsburgh so we walked down the street from the Altar Bar to check it out. Can't say the service was friendly, but come on! That's what I expected from a couple dudes making sandwiches, grilling, and getting orders shouted at them.  This felt like a true blue collar joint where you go just to enjoy some good American food. I can't say I didn't love the decor: some tables thrown in with some cheap chairs and paintings/characitures of  famous Pittsburgh athletes. It just added to its grittiness. I was only half surprised that the place wasn't painted black, white, and gold. I ordered the \"Soon to be Famous\" Colossal Fish sandwich and it did not disappoint. There is something to love about food that is simple, fried, messy, and to the point. I piled on the ketchup and cayenne pepper sauce. My favorite part had to be the marinated coleslaw. I am not a fan of the traditional mayonnaise-slaw you normally get, so this opened my eyes to what true coleslaw should taste like. My only complaint is that I wish the cayenne pepper sauce had some heat to it as it was really watery and I always feel food like this needs a little kick to it. But next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll be stopping at Primanti Brothers for another Colossal Fish."}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh mainstay that I'd recommend visiting at least once. I feel that some of the greatness of this place is wasted on me as a vegetarian, however, there's still an option or two for those out there. Further, the fries are pretty average."}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh, have a Primanti sandwich.  These oversized sandwiches are famous and it is easy to see why.  Each one comes with cole slaw, fries and a tomato inside of it.  I ordered grilled chicken with swiss and it was very good.  After I finished, I just polished off a Thanksgiving dinner.  The service was good and everything was as expected."}
{"text":"It was fun to go to this Pittsburgh institution, even if it isn't the original location. I sat at the bar and people watched, watched tv and let the lunch hour slip away with a corned beef and cheese. The staff were nice, even though they had a pretty busy lunch crowd, and the beer was cold. The sandwich was even pretty good but not spectacular, exactly what I expected but that's meant as praise."}
{"text":"I have to say, I am always satisfied here. The service can be spotty, but it doesn't make itself out to be some fancy place. They are not known for the service, it's about the food.

One thing: even when it was super busy and we were waiting for a while, the servers really hustle to get you what you need. One night the whole place was packed with one guy working the grill and the other guy in charge of the bar, tables, and register. He wasn't perfect but he was damn good.

The pastrami is my favorite and I highly recommend. You just can't go wrong with salty meat and fresh cole slaw in a sandwich loaded with fries. The downside is the Italian bread can get a bit soggy, especially on the side the sandwich is laying on. Very filling, even for a big eater. Sometimes I can only eat half. I like to get the whole pickle too, but it is large. 4-6 spears and I have to believe it's more than one pickle.

The biggest issue I have with this location is the bathroom. It's down a steep set of stairs and it's a big ol' effort to go. Also, they are not great about refills. Not sure if these things are related...

All in all, good food, good price. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros is a unique and solid Pittsburgh delicacy. Not only was my sandwich tasty, the sandwich itself could have fed three of me.
 
Boyfriend had the pimanti cheesesteak, which isn't actually a cheesesteak. I had the salami sandwich but forgot to ask for cheese. It was still good. 
If I lived here, I would take visitors here for a taste of local flavor, but the sandwiches aren't exactly my dish... it's too much food and not easily kept as left-overs."}
{"text":"I'm a Pittsburgher that moved to California. This is alittle piece of home, my comfort food. Everytime I come back, this is a must stop. This is a meet up spot for me when I am back in the burgh. Luckily, I don't live close. I'd def gain a few. HA!

There are so many good memories at this location. Late night eats off of Carson Street with friends during college and highschool. My bf worked at the Route 51 location. Everytime he wears his old tee shirt with a giant sandwich on it  while hiking... I want to kill him. I feel like I'm chasing a giant sandwich!!

Hands down Primantis is a Pittsburgh tradition. I love the roast beef and I like to throw some hot sauce on it! :)

This place takes me back to simplier times. Alittle Iron City, some amazing sandwiches (with fries piled ontop) and the Steelers."}
{"text":"Obviously, you can't go to Pittsburgh and not have Primanti Bros., yet everyone seems to say it's uninspired and gross. While stuffing fries into your sandwich isn't particularly original (we used to do this with our Happy Meals), I find the food decent and an awesome value. I don't know of many other places in the Burgh where I can be this full for seven bucks. To top it off, their draft beer is something crazy like $2 a pint, $2.75 for a larger size. Awesome. However, I would agree with other reviewers to steer clear of the regular sandwich, which uses a square of grey matter for meat. I've ordered both the corned beef and roast beef and been happy with both."}
{"text":"As a native Pittsburgher it breaks my heart to write this, but Primanti Bros has gone way down hill.  I think they have been featured too many times on the Travel Channel or the Food Network, maybe they are beginning to believe their own hype.  I enjoyed these sandwiches when I lived grew up in Pittsburgh, so I was quite eager to share this experience with my friends a few weeks ago.  They had never been to Pittsburgh, so this was going to be their first taste of a local favorite.  

The food:  Bread was stale, major disappointment.  The meat was non-existant, we ordered Kielbosa, Double Egg, Angus Beef and the Pittsburgher.  I am not a salt user, ever, but I had to load on the salt to get any flavor out of my sandwich.  The portions were still decent size, but who wants cold fries, tasteless meat and stale bread.  

Side Items:  The appetizers were still good, but fried food is pretty hard to mess up.

Cost:  Price was pretty reasonable, but the food was mediocre.

Ambiance - the original location is still the best, the chains are okay, but the food is lacking more so in the franchise locations."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. I went there after seeing it on the Food Network to try to sample the sandwiches that they're known for. Well having those extra items such as french fries and coleslaw stuffed inside my sandwich was unexpected, even though I know they were going to do it, it was interesting taste and added a certain flavor to the sandwich.
Served on thickly sliced white bread the Sounders are quite filling and definitely a crowd favorite not only for the tourists and people passing through but also for the locals that work in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, can you say OVERRATED? I'm from Chicago and am not sure if people in PA are just used to average food but this was a bit of a disappointment! 

I had looked forward to trying this sandwich for awhile and it did not live up to the hype. BLAND BLAND BLAND. Fortunately they have malt vinegar there so I could add a little flavor. Mayo helped as well. I had capicola and cheese. Everything was just tasteless from the slaw to the meat. The fries arent bad but it doesnt make a sandwich automatically good by smashing a bunch on them. I'm a big fan of the idea but this was not satisfactory. My friend had the cheese steak which was a processed cube of steak. He was also dissatisfied. The beer mightve been the best part. I was turned on to Yuengling during my visit and am not a lager fan but it is a tasty beer! The service was acceptable but we did end up there around 4:30. The thick, handcut slices of bread are pleasing but it gets served in a small basket and impossible to find the bottom of the sandwich. Very messy. 

Oh and I heard them saying they had 38 loaves of bread left at about 5pm on a Fri night. They claim to be open til 2am. You do the math. 

I may try a sandwich at the original location at some point in my life but my initial impression was a total letdown."}
{"text":"Super sandwiches in here. Bread was light and fresh. Stacked super high with fillings. 

I got the grilled chicken with extra bacon. All in, $9!

Could barely finish it. Great service, super friendly servers. Very young / college type vibe. Loud. Not a date spot."}
{"text":"Coming from NY... We came for #NSBE44! We were seated immediately! I ordered the Angus w/Bac & a side order of cheese fries... They added their own slaw as well as fries to the sandwich... Not too bad...Bread was soft!.. I would've added more cheese ... Cheese fries had a little too much salt... The staff was funny! I wouldn't rush to go bk... However I would return..."}
{"text":"I've heard about the place, through a few past classmates from grad school who are from or have visited Pittsburgh, but never had the chance to visit. 

That changed when two little events came together: I was taking the Megabus from Cincinnati to NYC and in between routes, needed something to eat during a 2-hour layover. And a friend who I met during grad school had just moved to Pittsburgh, so I proposed we meet up, and try Primanti Bros. Because Chris and his new wife could pick me up, I suggested we drive a little bit and head to the original Strip District location.

I was a little daunted as to what to order, especially since the menu was on the walls, rather than printed handheld, but decided on the roast beef sandwich. Very tasty, especially with the fries in it! I also appreciated the decor in the restaurant (I am a Penguins fan). The place wasn't too busy, so the atmosphere was relaxing.

If I'm in Pittsburgh again, Primanti's is a must for me (and you!)"}
{"text":"Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh. So much hype. So disappointing. 

I mean, it wasn't bad - but there are so many other sandwich places in Pittsburgh that I feel would have been way more amazing than here. I mean, I guess we can check it off our list, at least. I got the fish sandwich and man-friend got the #2, which ended up being way more like an actual hamburger, and way less like a cheese-steak sandwich. The coleslaw wasn't as delicious as I had hoped it would be, and the fries got all soggy sitting in the soupy-ness of the coleslaw. And the bread was just, white bread. NBD. 

Everyone who live(s)(d) here told us no. They tried to warn us. We didn't listen, but wished we would have. Now, we are trying to warn you, and you probably won't listen either. But maybe you will disagree and give it 5 stars! Who knows, that's the beauty of yelp and food reviews!"}
{"text":"On a cross country roadtrip very very very rarely does a place live up to the hype.  This place does hands down.

Good prices good food.  Period."}
{"text":"Great place! Wait time was about 20 minutes not too bad. Waitress is unhappy but food and atmosphere makes up for it. Definitely bring your out of town guests here to experience Primanti"}
{"text":"Love this place and this location!. Ordered take out for my best friend and I! We both ordered the Colossal Fish sandwich with everything on the side. I know what your thinking \"you cant do that\" But you can and when ordering takeout, If you don't want your food getting as soggy order things on the side. It was excellent a per usual. Though it lives up to its name, it really is colossal! I've dinned in at this location before and I have to say both experiences have been great. The staff is always friendly and prompt to help. My takeout only took 15 mins. by the time I ordered and drove there it was ready. Thanks Primanti Bros for always being awesome!"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros in Southside was a wonderful Pitt experience for my husband and I who were visiting this city for the first time! We went late on a Monday night, & it wasn't busy at all! The music was fun (some may say a bit loud), & our service was great! Our waitress was super down to earth, & the sandwiches were delicious! Our total for 3 people with 3 sandwiches, 16 wings, 3 beers, & a cocktail was $50 excluding tip! It was a great Pitt experience, & we can see why Primanti Bros was featured Guy's Diners, drive-ins, and dives!"}
{"text":"I have never met a potato I did not like. With that said, when the boyfriend told me about the legendary Pittsburgh sandwiches at Primanti Brothers, I knew I just had to try them. French fries IN the sandwich you say?!?

I'm the gal that rejoiced when Liz Lemon gives the golden advice to put potato chips in your sandwiches. \"Finally,\" I thought. \"Someone gets me!\" With that in mind, the boyfriend and his parents were gracious enough to take me to Pittsburgh's sandwich mecca. Primanti Brother's has been expanding quite a bit in southwestern Pennsylvania, but it is at the original Strip District location that you get that real old timey feel. Our group of 4 were seated immediately around 1:30PM on a Monday.

In a nutshell, this genius sandwich was created many moons ago to help accommodate to truck drivers who needed sustenance in a hurry (or so legend dictates). The result is a giant sandwich consisting of Italian bread, sweet and sour cole slaw, tomatoes, provolone cheese, a handful of fries, and your choice of meat. In all seriousness though, this sandwich isn't as terrifying as it sounds. The bread holds up great, the fries are perfect and hand-cut, and the slaw has just the right balance of sweet and sour that isn't overwhelming on the palate.

I LOVED this sandwich...and I hate cole slaw. I ordered the steak and cheese version of the sandwich as recommended by newlyweds Jess and Brian (we were in town for their wedding), while boyfriend opted for salami and his parentals got the pastrami. After stealing a couple of bites here and there, I've decided that everything was a winner. The steak was tender, the salami was cured well, and the pastrami (while different than what I am used to in LA and NYC), was perfectly lean and thinly sliced. At under $10 a pop, you can't lose.

I am glad that my first Primanti's experience was at the Strip District, which is still quite lively with specialty food vendors and warehouses supplying the city's restaurants. The industrial surroundings are exactly the kind of image someone from out of state imagines Steeler town, and with a view of the smoke-stacks coming out of the Heinz plant just a stone's throw away, it's a point of Pittsburgh pride that can't be beat."}
{"text":"Man v. Food brought me here. The atmosphere is Steeler Nation. The food was decent, I guess I just expected more...The server was fairly rude when asked about the selection of cheeses they offer. Sandwich 1-5=3."}
{"text":"It's a staple here in Pittsburgh. Pittsburghers love it, it's a great 'this will do' type place. Was a nice visit, food was good. However, I would only recommend it to tourists."}
{"text":"A local favorite.  This is an institution in Pittsburgh.  Cash only.   Personally, I would go for the beer and to hang out but honestly, the sandwiches are not that  great.  Pittsburgh has so many great restaurants and unfortunately, this one needs improvement."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing special about this place. The idea is cute put everything in the sandwich but I think it's famous just by word of mouth and maybe for what it once was. The food was not tasty at all I would spend my money, time and calories elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not good - after nearly finishing the first half of my sandwich I noticed MOLD!! Totally gross and completely unacceptable. First time here and will NEVER return. Nasty and stomach totally turned over this experience - be careful if you come here - you've been warned!!"}
{"text":"First time to primantes.. Per the other reviewers comments I decided to have my fries on the side.  Had the \"cap and egg\"  it was the wsitress' recommendation.  It was good but the Cole slaw flavor overwhelmed the meat.  I think if in pit again I will try the pizza."}
{"text":"Had the wings and French fries-way too greasy! My friend had the sandwich which he said was good but looked ridiculously huge! Not impressed.
They should serve food with a side of tums..
Beer was good and cold but that was my only positive impression.."}
{"text":"Great food and very convenient location. The people that work there are very friendly. And the atmosphere is great for sports games."}
{"text":"according to my husband, these sandwiches make driving to pittsburgh \"worth it\". you have your choice of meats (steak, pastrami, etc.) topped with coleslaw and fries- DELICIOUS. we usually go to the suburban one (monroeville) and the restaurant there is more spacious and cleaner (with lots of televisions for sports fans). there are also more choices on the menu (delicious wings btw). but when we ate at the market square one over the weekend (surprisingly packed considering that it was 2pm on saturday and with all the construction), the sandwiches seemed to taste better there for some reason. i ordered the corned beef one and hubs ordered capicola (with egg).  i know people have eaten there and thought that the sandwiches were just ok (so i shouldn't hype it up). it's possible that my taste buds are just being biased and sentimental because it's a pittsburgh thing. but the fact that my husband who's not from pittsburgh loves it should definitely say a lot."}
{"text":"French fries INSIDE my sandwich...what's not to love about that?  Ate here while visiting the Burgh and it was so obnoxiously yummy.  These huge amazing sandwiches are messy and hard to pick up, but they are worth the 1000 napkins you'll go through.  Have one with the meat of your choice and a bottle of Yuengling and you are in business."}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh instituition and they make the single greatest sandwich in the world!  Whether it is late night after the bars are closed, in the middle of the day for lunch, or just for the heck of it for dinner there is nothing better than a pastrami and fries w/ slaw!"}
{"text":"Wow easily my favorite place to get sandwiches in the USA. I love this place and Toni she is the soul of the city and has been making amazing memories since the 80's when I first came here. The turkey and cheese is my favorite."}
{"text":"Love me some Primanti Bros sammiches. With full disclaimer though, there is nothing better than the original location!  This being only 2 months open everything was new and clean. Staff was great and so was the sammich. I think the coleslaw was a tad off from the original though. Fries and egg were on point, just the coleslaw seemed a little off. Overall, great......now go get you some"}
{"text":"Yes yes and yes.....go and enjoy one of the Pittsburgh staples. The sandwiches are large and filling; the bread is always fresh and you have to get an egg on it

I'm a little biased because I just love Primanti Bros., but the everything was clean, fresh, and pleasant so it was a great experience at this location. Go and enjoy, but always take time to go to the original also if you have the time"}
{"text":"I love a good primanti sandwich.  I think they changed fries seasoning because they were actually salty.  Usually I have to add salt.  The waitresses were a little to be desired though and that is the reason for 3 stars.  3 girls looked at us before a 4th came over.  I had to say we were ready to order because she started to walk away. She challenged my beer selection too. She thought I said a fru fru drink even though I pointed to the craft beer page.  The waitress then pressured us to leave by standing by the table with a broom and dust pan hovering while we put our coats on."}
{"text":"Visited Pittsburgh last month, I was told this was the place to try. I ordered the Pastrami, it was really good and fresh. I didn't care for the fries on the sandwich, they were pretty soggy. My daughters ordered the Steak and Cheese, they didn't finish the sandwich. They were expecting the traditional sliced steak, instead it was a patty, reminded me of a Steak Um. We got the loaded fries, the cheese was kind of like cheese whiz, the bacon tasted like bacon bits not fresh bacon.  They accept Cash Only. Stick to the deli meats, pastrami, turkey, corned beef. I'd stay away from the Steak and Cheese and Fries. My sandwich was great, sorry my daughters didn't have the same experience. If you are a tourist it is definely a great spot to check out and get the experience. I found the staff very friendly. Enjoyed our stay in Pittsburgh and all the nice people."}
{"text":"My family and I were invited to check out the newest Primanti Bros. location on Penn Avenue in Garfield as they were training their new staff. This was once the location of Verde/ Prairie. The Primanti's staff did a great job as this location looks nothing like it did previously and really feels like a Primanti Bros. now. Every bit of useable space has been used to add as many seats and tables as possible. There are also lots of big screens everywhere to help cheer on the Bucs, Pens and Steelers.

On our pass we were given a specific time to arrive which was 6pm. Once we arrived our party of four could barely fit inside as there were quite a few people ahead of us waiting to be seated. About 15 minutes later the hostess asked for our name our party size and told us that the wait would be about 20 minutes. Some people who arrived after us were seated before us because the hostess had asked them for their names before making her way to us which made our wait even longer. 

By now we had been standing around for 45 minutes and still weren't seated. The reason the wait was so long was that people were finished eating and were just hanging out instead of getting up so people who were waiting could be seated. We were offered something to drink while we waited which was a nice touch.

Finally we were seated Alexander our server came to tell us about the food and take our drinks orders. The music was way too loud as we could hardly hear Alexander speak and had to repeat to each other what he had said. He was very green and should have had a seasoned server to show him the ropes first. We had to ask him to refill our daughters glass as it was empty for qit a while.

The adults at the table started off with the Drunk Duck cocktail which was amazing and helped me to quickly forget how pissed off I was with the long wait. Next we chose a bucket of the Spicy Garlic wings which were amazing once we finally got to eat them as we had to flag down another server to get some plates. The wings were nice and juicy and cooked to perfection. 

For our sandwiches my wife and our friend both got the New Yorker which is Primanti's version of a New York Deli sandwich. Our daughter chose the Pitts Burger with double meat and I chose the Black Angus with double meat. I can say with confidence that these were some of the best Primanti Bros. sandwiches we have ever had.

This was this locations first day of service and thankfully for Primanti Bros. this was a test run before the official grand opening on 1/18/17. Once the waiting situation is worked out and the music is turned down I'm sure this will be one of Primanti's most popular locations."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of years ago and wasn't wowed by the sandwich. I think I was more taken back by the sweet slaw and french fries my sandwich than the bread or large portion of meat. Now that I'll be back in Pitt tomorrow I'm looking forward to trying another sandwich. I guess the sandwiches are pretty good now that I remember."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a heretic. I'm prepared to be stoned by the fundamentalists.

A native sent me here, an apparent Pittsburgh landmark. My wife and I are not cole slaw fans, so we ordered our hot sausage sandwich sans slaw.

What I got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich. The fries were lifeless and the hot sausage was not not. The bread was devoid of texture and flavor.

So, yeah, I didn't order it The Way It's Supposed To Be. Maybe if you're into cole slaw, this is the place to go, but if you don't, keep walking. Service was indifferent, at best."}
{"text":"Classic sandwich joint. Ordered the Ruben sandwich & it was amazing! Pricing was reasonable and the service was good."}
{"text":"I don't have to rate this place.  If you're in Pittsburgh and you want to taste the local best like every person there will tell you about this place.  But it is worth stay, this is like the best sandwich ever.  So yeah I have been to places that I felt the hype was a little bigger than the meal but this is not one of those places.  It really is that good."}
{"text":"Their redeeming quality is that they can be nice but don't ask for any special modifications because they simply will not to it. As for the food, I ordered the turkey and cheese and it just plain. Nothing special about them to be honest. The bread is nice and fluffy but a waste of a meal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ok, so I get it - if you visit Pittsburgh, you have to stop here.  Done.  

No other restaurant in the strip was open past 8pm on a Friday so I found myself here.  I opted for the Capicola sandwich and a Dr. Pepper last night.  The big deal about this place is that all sandwiches come with slaw and fries...in the sandwich! And let's be honest, the more fries I have the excuse to eat...the happier I end up. But the sandwich just didn't do it for me.  All of the elements separated were good, but all together were just bland.  I ended up pouring on some hot sauce and eventually dismantling the sandwich for the fries glued together by cheese.  Maybe I just needed mayo...

Cool little spot though - neighborhood joint still.  Good bar to sit and watch the Penguins play."}
{"text":"Now I'm not much of a sandwich person but the roast beef with cheese sandwich I tried at this place was delicious. The taste was surprisingly good and I think stuffing it with fries and coleslaw really added to the flavor."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love primantis? Pro tip, their happy hours are great. Cheap beer and Dollar slices of pizza. the perfect way to wind down your day."}
{"text":"I came here after hearing a lot of hype to have lunch during my visit in Pittsburgh. I ordered the Pittsburger and a side of the loaded fries. The Pittsburger was good, maybe worth trying since it is unique with the french fries loaded into it. I also like that the cole slaw was light and finely sliced, so that it made it easier to eat. However, it lacked the wow-factor for me.. with something that has no many things loaded into it, I'd expect a lot of flavor, but it just was not there.

The loaded fries were only OK to me.. even though they had cheese, chili, sour cream, and bacon bits on top it surprisingly tasted bland! It was just missing that oomph of flavor for me.

Overall, it was good, but not something that I'd particularly come back for."}
{"text":"Not even ashamed that I ate two meals here in a span of twelve hours. If you don't know what to expect when you arrive you may be overwhelmed. Everything there is served on paper and you pay at the counter when you go to leave after you have been waited on. I went to the original Strip District location for the original experience and sat at the bar. It was the same day as a Steelers game so it was packed, but had such an electric and spirited vibe. For lunch I had the capicola & cheese and for dinner enjoyed the pastrami & cheese. What makes these sandwiches unique is that they are made right in front of you and topped with slaw, tomato, and fresh cut french fries on French bread. The only decision you really have to make is what kind of meat you want on it. I clearly loved it since I ate there twice and maybe have had dreams of it since the occasion. I want more and I want it soon. Great for tourists and locals alike."}
{"text":"When I told my coworker that I was visiting Pittsburgh he told me that trying this place was an absolute MUST...and boy oh boy was he right. 

I arrived a little after lunch and the line was practically out the door (always a good sign). After a short wait I grabbed a seat on the patio and checked out the menu.  I decided to go with the pastrami and cheese sandwich topped with slaw and fries. 

I mean seriously...how can you go wrong with fries inside your sandwich?! When the sandwich arrived the size alone was amazing. But lucky for me it tasted great too! The bread was fresh, the pastrami was tasty, the slaw added a nice kick and did I mention the fries?! Totally a win. 

When I got back to work I thanked my coworker for the recommendation. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Cole slaw on my sandwich? Fries on my sandwich too? They serve beer here?

All these questions and more went through my head my first time taking a trip to Primanti's Brothers during my freshman year of college. The famous sandwich there, the steak and cheese with fries and cole slaw is just OK, but the capicola with cheese is AMAZING. I get one every time I go to a Pirates game and anytime we make a trip to the Strip District. Service is cocky and arrogant, but hell, its supposed to be. Its all part of the experience. Each shop, especially this one (the original), looks like a dive, and again part of the experience.

Basically, you have not truly visited Pittsburgh until you get one."}
{"text":"My wife and I just visited Philly, NYC, Central Jersey and Pittsburgh.  Top of my list in our visit to Pittsburgh was Primanti Brothers.  We got there on a weekday around 3 p.m.  Place was nearly empty, so we could sit at the bar.  I order the Pittsburgher, wife had the bacon and cheese.   Also order the Smallman Fries (cheese, jalapenos and sour cream).

Expectations for this meal were high.  Food came quick and as I took my first bit I immediately noticed that I couldn't taste anything.  The bread felt soft, but the only taste in my mouth was a ton of vinegar laced slaw.  It completely overwhelmed the sandwich.  The \"Pittsburgher\" patty had no flavor and seemed like it had been warmed up in a microwave.  Just a bunch of microwaved sadness buried in there.

The fries on the sandwich were lukewarm at best and not crispy.  Wife had the exact same thought about her sandwich.  She ended up picking out the bacon and left everything else on the sandwich in place.  

Smallman fries were a gooey mess.  Again, fries have to be crispy, and especially when they are literally buried in a ton of tasteless nacho cheese, sour cream and whatever else was on them.  

Just gonna say it:  This place is incredibly overrated.  I can't see how anyone would think this is good.  Was incredibly disappointed.  If this place is great food in Pittsburgh, the bar is set pretty low."}
{"text":"The fries inside the sandwich was really good, but wasn't a big fan of the vinegar based slaw."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great service. The bar is the place to sit...reminds you a a hometown bar and not a chain... highly recommend if you like sandwiches..."}
{"text":"Sigh. Stopped in on a visit from out of town, only because of the fame. With so many awesome food options around, would not come back. Two stars was for the service which was great even with the place being packed. The food was a total yawn, nothing wrong with it, just boring."}
{"text":"I love these places!  Anytime I get a chance chapel back to you, like to go to a good deli or sandwich shop. I really love this East Coast feel in the good old fashion Decor, it reminds me of my childhood in Baltimore in the 60s and 70s.

Pittsburgh is an awesome place and if you  love food, there are many many choices here.

I had a steak sandwich... just ok"}
{"text":"We went because its a Pittsburgh tradition but I cannot say I loved it. It was a sandwich with undercooked fries. Definitely not my favorite."}
{"text":"I don't get what all the fuss is about.
People rave about this place, it has been on the Food Network, and it's just all around famous.  I'm not sure why.

I went there twice while I lived in Pittsburgh and was completely disappointed both times.  It looks and feels like exactly the kind of place I normally like, but the food just isn't good.  The sandwiches are totally greasy and bland.  The fries are soggy and the bread tastes like nothing and is cut way too thick.

I dunno.  Maybe you just have to be really drunk to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Am I the only person a live that does not like Primanti's??? I think so. I write this review knowing full well I am risking my own personal safety. 
I write, fearing some drunken yinzer fresh off a Steelers loss may find me and beat me to a bloody pulp with a bar of soap wrapped in a terrible towel...
I write... because I must.

I really don't like these sandwiches. I refer to them as garbage sandwiches. Oh I know.. it's a novelty because it has fries and slaw and tons of meat and lard bread.  
The sandwich is too big for my mouth to bite into. 
I get sneers and stink eyes when I remove the fries and eat them separately. I hate slaw. I hate mayonnaise. I don't care for the bread. There is too much meat on the sandwich. They ALWAYS put the god damn tomato on it even when you explicitly tell me no tomato. LISTEN TOMATO MAKES ME GAG. Those disgusting little seed sacs, BARF.

Sure this place is a great place for me to take out of towners. They marvel at the disgustingness that is american cuisine. 
Bigger. Fatter. Heftier. Fuller. 

This is great hangover food, in that throwing it up is easy. It's bland. It's white. It's bland white people food. 
You'd think I'd love it, I'm the whitest person I know. But damn... give me some spices maybe a little schmear on the bread. SOMETHING.  
The fries are not seasoned. The slaw is drippy and hard to masticate. 

Oh please Pittsburghers, please don't beat me to death. 
You can eat your big ass garbage sandwiches and I'll go back to my tacos."}
{"text":"We are from Dallas but this place was amazing! We wanted to try what the locals love the most which is the Pitts-burgher.   I was suspicious of trying it because it has cole slaw and fries on it but it was GOOD!! It was so good we went here again the next day."}
{"text":"I got the Pitt cheeseburger. Dry meat with some filler. I was really surprised by the poor quality of the meat. Couldn't taste the cheese. The fries and coleslaw were good. I freaking hate those big honking supermarket tomato slices--why am I eating a sandwich topped with that? My tummy hurts a little now. The waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today. No frills just lots of frys on top of everything including my salad lol not what I was expecting from a salad...The vegetable soup was good and hearty lots of veg. My steak salad was just ok. The meat was well done dry  shaved sandwich like steak with a few tough grizzly un chewable pieces that had to be spit out, on top of iceberg lettuce sliced olives and shredded cheese topped with a mound of frys served in a take out box with plastic fork even though I was dining in. This is a fast food chicken wing & French fry kind of place."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is fair.  My only complain is that the place was a bit dirty (our table smelled funny and there was a bit of trash on the floor)."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. It's open 24 hours and on New Years. This was my first time in Pittsburgh and everyone told me to go here. This is what Pitt is known for. Typically when people tell me I have to try a staple of a certain city, I am left disappointed because it's overhyped, the wait is typically forever, and the food is not THAT good. However Primanti Bros was not overhyped for nothing. 

I walk in and there's open seating everywhere. It was crowded but not overly crowded. I hate when there's a wait and I see a bunch of open tables. primantis self seating was perfect. The waitress came over right away and got us our drinks. Idk if this time was just not as busy because it's New Year's Day and I was there during the steelers game (they were playing the browns... there's not a worse team in the NFL). 

We ordered. I got 3 sandwiches (Cajun chicken, pastrami, and the pittsburger), and the smallman chilli cheese fries. The fries came out immediately. It was faster than jimmy johns and it was hot and fresh and delicious. The 3 sandwiches came out in less than 5 min after. The service was impeccably quick! 

The smallman chilli cheese fries were topped with chilli, sour cream and bacon. It could honestly use a bit more bacon but they were delicious. The sandwiches all come with Cole slaw and fries stuffed in them. The Cole slaw was perfect, it was not overly flavored so it did not take away from the taste of the meats. The French fries were crispy so it added a bit of a crunch to the sandwich. All the meats were perfectly cooked to the right tenderness. They were evenly cut on halves and served to us on plastic wrap and not a plate. I prefer this because it's more economical. 

For $7, these sandwiches are ridiculously filling, I couldn't even finish each half out of the 3 sandwiches that I ordered.

Highly recommend coming here. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, this will definitely be my first stop again!"}
{"text":"Before Food Network started showing a bajillion shows about sandwiches with french fries, fried eggs, cheese sticks, the kitchen sink  and other stuff piled on top of them, there weren't that many restaurants doing it. Now you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a restaurant that is piling anything on top of a sandwich to try to stand out.

Primanti's, however, isn't some new fad. They have been putting fries and cole slaw on their sandwiches for roughly 745 years (Note: that may be slightly innacurate, but the point is, they've been around a while). This started as a way for the blue collar workers of Pittsburgh to be able to carry their whole lunch in one hand, to eat on th go... and a great idea was born. Adding a fried egg to any sandwich is an option, and it is also almost always a good idea - and should be mandatory if you order the cappicola and cheese. 

Primanti's has a lot of locations now, pretty much all around the Pittsburgh area, but unlike most chains, they seem to have suffered no growing pains from expansion, and every restaurant seems to be top notch and consistent in food quality. The regular sandwiches are big, but if you want to grow your waistline a couple inches in one sandwich, get the colossal fish. It is ridiculously large, and the fish is great. If you're feeling a little adventurous and have never had a real sardine before, try the sardine sandwich. These aren't those slimy little jarred bait fish you get in grocery stores. They are nice sized real sardines - a little oily, just enough briny sea flavor, and being Primanti's, you get plenty of them.

If you've never been to Primanti's before, its definitely worth a stop... and with locations all over the Pittsburgh area, they're easy to find."}

Adding a fried egg to any sandwich is an option, and it is also almost always a good idea - and should be mandatory if you order the cappicola and cheese. 

Primanti's has a lot of locations now, pretty much all around the Pittsburgh area, but unlike most chains, they seem to have suffered no growing pains from expansion, and every restaurant seems to be top notch and consistent in food quality. The regular sandwiches are big, but if you want to grow your waistline a couple inches in one sandwich, get the colossal fish. It is ridiculously large, and the fish is great. If you're feeling a little adventurous and have never had a real sardine before, try the sardine sandwich. These aren't those slimy little jarred bait fish you get in grocery stores. They are nice sized real sardines - a little oily, just enough briny sea flavor, and being Primanti's, you get plenty of them.

If you've never been to Primanti's before, its definitely worth a stop... and with locations all over the Pittsburgh area, they're easy to find."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Bar tender/waitress/server took our order for drinks then food and COMPLETELY IGNORED us for nearly 45 minutes after we finished eating. Never came to check on us or ask if we wanted more drinks. A little rude if you ask me considering 2 empty pints of beer sat on our table as we say right next to the bar. Good food but poor service and attitude I can't give this place a recommendation."}
{"text":"Love having this location close to home. Staff are friendly and the food is always fantastic."}
{"text":"Don't know if it's just me or they changed the coleslaw recipe. Tastes like they put a lot of horseradish sauce in it. Used to be my favorite sandwich now my least."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh establishment whose concept (fries and slaw with meat on a sandwich) is, I think, solid, but the execution is pretty meh."}
{"text":"Our Primate Brothers sandwiches were good, but they could have used more seasoning for the different layers. We were excited to try them, but did not get the hype around them."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today since it's on the list of \"must see\" places in Pittsburgh. I ordered the world famous \"Pitts-burger.\" It's unlike most other burgers in that French fries and cole slaw are placed on top of the meat in the sandwich. I e never had anything like that before.

It's definitely unique and worth a try. I didn't really like the sandwich that much but it's unique and the service was really polite and fast. It's a \"must see\" place while in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food. Definitely would recommend. Only thing I would say is that I wish they would toast their bread. Everything on the sandwich makes the bread soggy after awhile."}
{"text":"This place is a must every time I am in the Burgh!  I mean everything all sandwiched into one. . what's not to love???"}
{"text":"Nothing remarkable, but it's a fun concept and a Pittsburgh tradition.

You get a huge sandwich that could be split between two people. Service was quick and attentive!"}
{"text":"OK, I had to take down my PIF before writing this review.  Personally identifiable photo.

The sandwich (Philly steak sandwich) that you've all heard about is a below average sandwich.  It sure is interesting, though!  A crappy little square of ground beef on the frier, topped with greasy fries, passable slaw, and surrounded by unremarkable thick-sliced white bread. Yeah, it is different, and there's a reason a lot of people aren't rushing to rip off their copyright.  I smothered it in Ketchup in order to make it passable. 

Enough ripping on the fare.  The guys that work there were totally cool, the place has character, and the pints are cheap.  That gets their star rating out of the basement.

I guess the place is famous.  I would go their once...."}
{"text":"Blah. I don't understand what the big deal is about this place (any of them). The food tastes like nothing. The fries taste like nothing, the sandwiches taste like nothing, everything is just flavorless. The price is ok, could be lower for the underwhelming food but it's not bad. The only reason I give this 2 starts instead of 1 is because the service is usually decent and, though it tastes like eating a sponge, you always leave full. 
You can get getter sandwiches at Bob's... Or Subway."}
{"text":"I've been here a few other times, and both times they were great. They stuff fries into your burger, so if you're into that, you'll love all of their burgers. Staff was kind and the service was good as well. There is plenty of seating and TV's all around the place. There is seating outside too. I got the Pitts-Burgh, which is their number 2 seller. It had a burger, tomato, cole slaw, and of course, fried. Visit here if you like fried and burgers!"}
{"text":"Visiting from ft. Lauderdale came here to experience the original primantis and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. 3 people running the whole place we sat at the counter 30 minutes and. It even a hello or a glass of water. The cook said \"sorry there's supposed to be 6 of us\" as we walked out. That's no excuse for us who traveled over 500 miles. Get it together"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros probably doesnt need yet another person to tell you how great their famous sandwiches are, or how their coleslaw is so unique and delicious, or how they are a pittsburgh institution, so instead i'll just add  how much i loved the bonus of the very cool industrial and beautiful buildings in the surrounding neighborhood.

If you're in or near pittsburgh, go to primanti;'s and get their Cheesesteak, then go drive over to Hines FIeld and have your picture taken with a statue of Art Rooney.  Oh yea, and spend the last 7 minutes before 5:00 racing through the Andy Warhol museums seven floors at top speed, and you will have the perfect pittsburgh day."}
{"text":"What a great sandwich, we were lucky to go on a lower traffic night, were able to sit at the counter , watch the food being cooked and chat it up with the staff ! 

Great sandwich to \" split \""}
{"text":"I'll be honest -- I hate fries and slaw on sandwiches.  They're side dishes, not sandwich toppings.  When my best friend begged me to go to Primanti's I groaned when I looked at their menu online.  I was happy to find an Italian sandwich on the menu once I got there in person that wasn't covered in fries and slaw and it was delicious.  Service was severely lacking though.  Our glasses were empty on a few occasions and when it came time to leave my husband had to shove the cash in the server's face as she wasn't checking back to see if we were ready to pay.  While it was a tasty sandwich, I won't go out of my way to return to Primanti's."}
{"text":"Okay...tried it again.  Ordered roast beef and cheese with double meat.  Much better!  This is the sandwich I remember.  Yes...it was about a dollar more....but well worth it.

Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Came here a lot as a student and it was a solid meal. They put a lot of meat, fries, and cole slaw into the sandwich. It's definitely not anything mindblowing, or especially innovative but it's uniquely Pittsburgh and it's got all the carbs and meat you need if you're hungry/hungover/drunk.

You can also pay a bit more for double meat or an egg and you can ask for onions for free. Getting an egg on the sandwich is fantastic. You can also ask them to remove the cole slaw or the fries or have them on the side instead if that's not your thing. 

This place is pretty close to both CMU and Pitt and there's a ton of bars and other restaurants in the area too so it's nicely situated and a ton of students end up going here. They also have beers on tap and it gets really dive-y on weekend evenings.

I would recommend trying the sandwiches starting with pastrami, kielbasa, or knockwurst. The non-sandwich items aren't great and I'd probably pass on all of those.

Definitely a place to check out if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I love Primanti's sandwiches. I'm a Pittsburgher and will always love their sandwiches. If you want to hear more about those, read other reviews. This one is for the service at this restaurant.

It's just bad. The servers are polite, but extremely inattentive. I'm going to go ahead and play my \"I Waited on Tables in High Volume Restaurants for Several Years\" card just so I can say that even during lunch rush, no, that level of absence is not acceptable. They take up to fifteen minutes to even greet the table, which leaves you looking around wondering who will be serving you, or if you can at least have a water. If I were serving, I'd at least pop over and say a quick, \"Hi, my name's Ali. I'll be with you in just a few minutes.\" No matter how busy you are, there are a few things you just don't let slip: greetings, drink refills, and a speedy check. If it's busy, communicate that delay by saying \"thank you for waiting,\" or \"sorry for the wait.\" Honestly that's all it takes. That's it! Primanti's servers were lacking in all of these things, and from the customer perspective, it really does make a difference in the experience. Ok, sorry for the rant, but they either need to better train the servers they have, or hire more so they aren't stretched so thin."}
{"text":"An institution that one should visit. My pastrami was great. The partner got roast beef. Delicious as always. It's my second time here and have never been disappointed. Very fast service. One thing to remember is that it's cash only. They do have an ATM in the lobby, but something to be aware of."}
{"text":"the best!  always have to grab a primanti brothers sandwich when i'm in the 'burgh.  there are a lot of knock offs out there but this is the real deal.  the bread is so soft and fluffy. don't you dare ask for the fries on the side. my mouth is watering thinking about the tastiness that is a real deal primanti brothers sandwich.  i need to stop writing reviews before lunch!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place less stars, I would. I'm incredibly angry my husband and I stopped here on our cross country trip. (We grew up near Harrisburg PA and now live in CO) We had several Pittsburgh friends relentlessly hound us that this place is the absolute best and that we needed to try it out. So we went out of our way to get off the turnpike to give this place a shot. It was a complete waste of an hour and a half of our lives...

We both got the Pitts-burger, which seemed to be their flagship item. I got mine without slaw, my husband with slaw. I didn't mind the French fries on the sandwich (I've put them on my own burgers before) but my husband thought they were too squishy and not crispy enough. I expected the meat to taste more like and have the consistency of a regular hamburger patty. It did not.... It tasted and had the consistency more along the lines of a meatball or a slice of meatloaf. It was also very bland. My husband describes his sandwich as biting through a chunk of mashed potatoes. 

Service was incredibly bad. We waited about 10 -15 minutes before the waitress even came to take our drink order. We placed our food order when we placed our drink order and proceeded to watch as two tables sat after us received their food. The couple at the table next to us were able to eat and settle their tab before we even got our food. During our meal, the waitress passed our table several times without checking in, and getting the bill took forever. In attempting to pay, we were simply going to leave the money on the table because she was taking so long, but we were seated next to the bathroom and didn't want someone else to walk off with it.

Needless to say, we will not be visiting this place again. And if this is supposed to be one of the better places to eat in Pittsburgh, I'd hate to visit the rest of their restaurants!

Don't waste you time and effort on this place! On our whole trip back to CO, we wanted to try local restaurants instead of just grabbing fast food but I'd much rather go to Mc Donald's over this place..."}
{"text":"No trip to Pittsburg is complete without a visit to Primati Brothers. The atmosphere is almost \"cult\" like. The sandwiches?  Well don't come if your on a diet or counting calories. Service is awesome and most have worked hear for many years and are happy to share the \"lore\" of how Primati's started. I have been here at least 3-4 x. Its really hard to go wrong with any thing you choose so pick something you like, whatever you order they will throw some fries on top so its always good and hard to go wrong. I'm told the downtown Pitt location is the best place to visit after a night of bar hopping. Regardless, of which location you visit. Primati's is a Pittsburgh icon well worth visiting"}
{"text":"The food is ok if you like a heart attack on a bun. The fries were soggy and greasy. I guess it's a novelty but after you have one sandwich, that novelty is gone. But the $1.80 beers were awesome."}
{"text":"this is the finest eatery in all of the world.  if you hate primanti brothers then you are un-American and hate baby kittens.

seriously though, two thick slices of fresh bread, french fries, cole slaw (the good kind, not the mayo covered sloppy kind) grilled meat, cheese and eggs!!!!  add some ketchup and/or hot sauce and wash it down with an IC Light from a plastic cup...that's eatin'

believe the hype

it's the best sandwich you're getting in Pittsburgh...and in fear of an onslaught from Philly natives...the best sandwich in PA...hell, it's the best in the USA...meat, cheese, fries, cole slaw on the same sandwich...all they have to do is hide a cheaply made toy from China in there and it's a damned happy meal."}
{"text":"Ah, Primanti's.  This place is SO fucking good.  You get your whole meal in a sandwich.  I usually get the roast beef and cheese (with homemade cole slaw and homemade fries in the sandwich).  And it's so big that if you weren't starving when you walked in, you won't be able to finish it.

The fries and cole slaw are worth coming for on their own.  Both are fresh-made.  Beer is usually cheap.  Service is friendly.  Prices are fair.

Warning: There is one in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but it is not the same experience."}
{"text":"The food was great! Our server Casey was awesome and had great recommendations since it was our first time.  This place had such a great atmosphere and prices were very reasonable.  Definitely a place to visit."}
{"text":"They are a very overrated sandwich, in my opinion. That might also be because my mom has made these herself since I was a kid, and they have always tasted fresher and less greasy made from her."}
{"text":"Had the gyro which was good.  Typical pub food.  The servers were very attentive and came to check on us and refill our drinks. Overall a good experience"}
{"text":"I got two sandwiches to go for a long bus ride home... The woman who took my order recommended I get the coleslaw on the side so the sandwiches wouldn't get soggy, which was nice. The coleslaw was actually my favorite part of the sandwiches, though: maybe they would've been better if I'd eaten them fresh, but they didn't have that much meat and in general were much smaller than I thought they would be."}
{"text":"Came in on the way to Cleveland last week for a bite.  The area was DEAD (it was Sunday night) and anyone who was out was here.  Service was a bit confusing to me, but the cook/server/hostess took our order about ten minutes in.  My pastrami was great, the BF's cheesesteak was just meh. Fries and coleslaw on the sammie was a nice little catch, and the interior was divy and dingy just like you'd want and expect.  It was super cheap for the amount of food we got though (yeah $15 dinner for two!).  I would want to try chili fries if we happen to go in again."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm not really sure what the fuss is about. 

When we arrived in Pittsburgh we heard about Primanti Bros. from everyone -- it was a Pittsburgh classic, a 'must try.' So, we went. Hubby got the pastrami sandwich (a much better choice, IMO) and I got the Pitts-burger. Both sandwiches were just...not worth a review, to be honest. It seems like Primanti tries to build impressive, Insta-worthy sandwich volume by piling bland slaw and soggy french fries on cheap white bread, and cuts corners on the actual meat quantity and quality. Oh, and maybe I'm being a princess here, but an actual plate would be nice. 

This is the original Primanti Bros. location, for what it's worth, so I guess if you want to underwhelm your Pittsburgh visitors with a disappointing sandwich, choose the Strip District location."}
{"text":"Cheap prices and you get what you pay for. The fries were very oily. I ordered a Pitt burger and got pastrami! I ate as it was late and the service was very slow. The quantity of pastrami was minimal :-(."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for years and finally made it there today. It was well worth the trip. 

While not the original location, this location has a great atmosphere, plenty of TV's and a nice outdoor patio. The service was great even during the busy lunch hour, and they bartender took the time to talk about the menu with a newbie like me. 

... and the sandwich. I now understand all the hype. The bread is great with a thin crunchy crust and a fresh bread so soft you leave finger prints in it. I had the pastrami and cheese (I was in Pittsburgh) and found that it was very flavorful, and not stringy or tough like pastrami can get. The tomato and shredded lettuce was so fresh I think they slice it for each individual sandwich, which they actually might. 

Fries on a sandwich is foreign to this Michigan boy, but they are delicious and add a nice texture to the sandwich. Fries on this area (PA - souther Ohio - W. Virginia) are... 1) put on everything, including salads; 2) have the skins on and are cut a little thinner than McD's. The skin crisps up a little, but the rest of the fry stays soft. 

The coleslaw on the sandwich is... all I can say is Bravo. Not overly dressed, it adds a distinct sweetness I haven't tasted anywhere else. I love my vinegar/Italian dressing/mustard on my sandwiches, any of which were not needed and would actually have ruined the whole thing. 

I now know why this is a Pittsburgh institution. I am proud to award it my 5 Napkin Award, with all the rights and privileges that go with it."}
{"text":"I need to not be so critical. Everybody has a bad night or two. The sandwiches are great, beer cold and the service is good. How can you not like a place that has a balloon animal station for the kids during dinner time?"}
{"text":"What else is there left to say? Gigantic sandwiches, with first class meat, layered with slaw and fries.   Although I am a sandwich lover, I can't say I thought I was finally in sandwich heaven. The bread was very soft and sort of fell apart after the slaw dressing drenched it.  The fries were very soft like they hadn't been cooked very well or had been allowed to sit around a long time.  There was a line to get in at noon on a Saturday. I much prefer a crunchy roll or slice of French bread, with any slaw on the dry side.  I like my fries crispy and on the side.  So I got to punch my ticket, say I've been here and learn this isn't the place for me."}
{"text":"I came into this primanti's for a family lunch, we sat down and order our food. We sat for almost an hour waiting to get our food, then when our food comes out everything was made wrong. Our sandwich's were cold and missing things. The pizza we got was very burnt and all the pepperoni that was on it, was on the edge. I am very dissatisfied! I do not recommend eating here. 


(They were not busy either)"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Not seasoned, fries were soggy and the people behind the counter were not friendly at all"}
{"text":"My love affair with Primanti's goes back to my first visit to Pittsburgh. After a red-eye with a stopover in Detroit in the middle of December and a devastating 4-1 loss to the NY Rangers, I made my first ever visit to Primanti Brothers for a sandwich and beer. The little restaurant in Market Square welcomed me with open arms, beckoning my southern self out of the snow and into the world of their signature sandwiches.

A few years down the road, I made my second visit on the way back from a job interview. Primanti's greeted me like an old friend, tempting me with Yuengling (I was living in Texas at the time) and cheese-filled comfort. Upon my move to Central Pennsylvania, the visits continued and the locations expanded. My order never changed (hello, one vegetarian sandwich!) and the quality never waivered. 

Soon after I started dating a Pittsburgher, we discovered a Primanti's only minutes away from his house. It was fate. Yes, definitely fate, if not fortune. It has become a weekly ritual for me to roll into town Friday evening after a 2-hour drive and ease my troubles at a wooden table with a big mug of beer and a slaw-filled sandwich. The service is always great--every single server and bartender I've encountered at any location has been laidback, genuinely friendly and attentive. They don't even judge the boyfriend when he burns his tongue on hot-out-of-the-kitchen pizza/fried zucchini/fried mushrooms/you name it.

Service was a little slow on our last visit--a busy Saturday night with lots of sports on (forgive my ignorance--I only follow hockey.) Drinks came out quickly, so I had no problem with the wait for food. Our fried mushrooms arrived and my date and I glanced at each other uneasily--they were still cold in the center. No worries, though, we'll just ask them to stick 'em on the fryer for another minute. The manager was on the floor helping out the servers racing around to serve an abnormally large number of large groups and caught wind of the slip-up. He had already stopped by to apologize for the wait and bring more drinks, which was more than kind as it demonstrates the high standards of the restaurant.

Sandwiches came out and we devoured them as usual. The manager surprised us by comping both of our rounds of drinks--totally unexpected. We would have gladly paid for everything since we were not upset or concerned at all about the mushrooms or the (not too long) wait, but he and our server assured us that they were committed to making sure guests had a great time and making it up to them if they didn't. WOW! Way to show customer appreciation!

And that's why I love Primanti's."}
{"text":"I know they're known for their sandwiches BUT.... Ya gotta try their white pizza!!!!
And Thursday's special is amazing!  
Pizza - salad - soda all for under $20!!!!"}
{"text":"As one who is not a Pittsburgh native it has taken me a while to develop my Primanti Brothers palette. I enjoy going to our local location in Cranberry and very much appreciate the unique food. The cheese steak is a real treat. 

This visit was a disappointment at best. I stopped in for lunch while I was in the area. The staff had a generally disinterested attitude and I practically had to wait on myself. I can deal with the Pittsburgh attitude, but the biggest issue here I witnessed as I was finishing my meal. Not only were the staff making the sandwiches with their bare hands (think of them sticking their paws directly in the slaw), they were also handling cash transactions in between. I'm don't consider myself a food-prep prude, but this is ridiculous and nothing short of a health issue. This is one of the few eateries in Pittsburgh that I will not return to voluntarily."}
{"text":"We heard so much about this place we had to try it out.  After waiting for a table and placing our order we got what seems to be a HUGE cabbage sandwich!
We couldn't even taste the meat! Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Pittsburgh, this has been a favorite (I went pre-gluten free and loved everything on the menu). Since being gluten free, the menu is drastically cut. See link for allergy information http://www.primantibros.com/resources/images/pdf/Allergen_Menu.pdf. 
However, the nachos, fries, and salads are mostly gluten free. I typically get the nachos and a cider."}
{"text":"I apologize in advance, Pittsburghers! I was excited to try a Primanti sandwich after seeing them on TV. Ugh, maybe I was doing it wrong, but my sandwich's top basically slid off of the bottom before it even hit the table and it was a huge mess of soggy bread, meat, coleslaw and fries. I don't get it. Fries were not even crispy (nor were they hot) and bread just untoasted plain bread. Not sure I understand what all the hubbub is about :) I'm certain I won't be back."}
{"text":"A must if you're visiting Pittsburgh! The sandwiches are amazing, with fresh cut French fries and a vinegar-and-oil coleslaw. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, the Smallman Street fries and hand tossed pizzas are great too. 

The staff is great at every location I've been to. If you let them know you're from out of town, the sandwiches tend to be even bigger! I bring all of my guests when they come to visit. 

The only drawback to Primanti's (or maybe a plus) is when a Pittsburgh sports team is playing. The place gets really loud, and if you're not paying attention to the game it can be pretty startling when a team scores. 

Overall, a great place to get a great meal at a great price."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Despite the one star review, I think everyone needs to try this sandwich at least once in their life, as its somewhat of an iconic Pittsburgh schtick.  With that said, once is probably enough.

Primanti's is famous because they famously pile fries and coleslaw into their sandwiches.  This traces back to the days of the steel workers, who had no easy way of eating/packing the coleslaw and fries, so what easier way to consume it than to stuff it into the sandwich.  I'd recommend the capicola and egg once you decide to make the plunge and pop your primanti's cherry.  The fries can be kind of soggy, but like I said, it's worth trying once.  I'd also recommend splitting the sandwich with someone else, if possible- it was definitely too much food and not worth saving for later."}
{"text":"Had the Pastrami and Cheese, and I learned that I don't care for French fries and cole slaw on my sandwich. They don't put much meat on them either. 
The place was packed, and had great murals of famous athletes, and it had a fun atmosphere. The bathrooms are in the basement, dirty and kind of creepy.
If you like your sandwich to be packed with fillers, good for you. We have a few NY style deli's here in AZ that load you up on the Pastrami, in my opinion, a much better sandwich. So I can say I've been to Primanti's, but I can't say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to primantis while getting ready to enjoy the football fame the next day. We walked in and had no clue what to do or what to get. A gentleman yelled at us saying two seats at the bar. Thanked him and sat down. We sat long enough to take pictures. Ordered  two beers came back ordered our sandwiches. Yummy! Nice people behind the counter..."}
{"text":"Here's how you can make your own Primanti Bros Sandwich at home:

Take two slices of Italian Bread, between them, mash together bland cole slaw, fries, some assorted meat, tomatoes. And at your fingertips is Pitt's pride and joy.  I'm not from here, so maybe I don't share the love. We weren't really drunk when we were eating here, and it was in the middle of the day. 

The service was pretty slow, but when our order was taken, the sandwich came out very fast.

It was a good sandwich in terms of having really hot meat, and cold tomatoes and cole slaw, but I didn't think its as tasty as it could have been.

I think the bread should be buttered and toasted/grilled texas toast, and they should use seasoned fries. Use some sweet North Carolina style Cole slaw. 
I came, I saw, and I conquered, but I'm giving it back. I probably won't be back ever again."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches...I am from out of town and always heard great things. I would say this definitely lived up to the hype, a decent amount of food for the price as well."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Went here on a road trip with my aunt, uncle and two younger cousins. We started with and order of terror tots; to quote my uncle, \"it's hotter in Pittsburgh!\" They were smothered in queso cheese, bacon, siracha and jalapeños. They were absolutely delicious, but not for the faint of heart! 

We had an assortment of burgers, everyone of them mouth watering and piled high with French fries and Cole slaw! The only draw back was that the fries and Cole slaw were a little over whelming on top of the burger but overall this place was awesome!"}
{"text":"I had the pastrami sandwich because it was the first one on the menu. It is definitely a unique sandwich, but not a fantastic sandwich. The flavorful ingredients are overpowered by two huge slices of white bread and a ton of french fries in the middle. I'm not a picky eater and I generally like eating unique dishes like this, so I finished it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for years - I didn't realize there were so many locations!  I was thrilled to hear there were some near my hometown in Greensburg - we came to this location to meet cousins from Pittsburgh halfway.  There were 11 of us, but this was no problem for our waitress.  We received excellent and fast service - even though 2 hours flew by before we knew it as we all hadn't seen each other in years!  We tried the fried pickles - GREAT with the exception of my pickle coming out of the fried stuff - I hate when that happens!  I just had to try the Pittsburgher - FANTASTIC!!!  It was stuffed with a meatloafy, coleslawy, tomatoey, French friey goodness!!  WOW!  I spent at least 5 minutes figuring how to eat this monstrosity, and started with pulling fries out of the sandwich, but didn't want to do that too much as I also wanted to eat them in the sandwich!  The bread was nice and thick too. I want to go back the next time I'm to try the fish sandwich!  There were options on the menu for those who wanted salads, but I can't imagine who would want a salad with amazing sandwiches that are served up here.  Loved the environment too - there was a bar side of the room with pool tables, and a family-style sit down dining area.  Lots of local sports pics and memorabilia - you really feel like you're in Pittsburgh here.  I think this might have to be a regular trip for me every time I'm back home!"}
{"text":"I know it's a Pittsburgh classic, but the place is honestly a bit overrated. I don't eat meat, so I always get the Egg and Cheese when I go to a Primanti Bro's, which isn't ideal, because I'm also lactose intolerant. it's rough. Wish they had more vegetarian options.

I went at about midnight after a flight from the west coast, and the host stand was empty. I ended up seating myself because no one was around; the servers were all too busy trying to close early. 

Food was average, I guess. I'm not a fan of their fries because they always seem under seasoned and soft. The bread also just can't hold the sheer amount of stuff on the sandwich. The coleslaw is always great, though. I guess it's something good to have at midnight, when you're too exhausted to care what it tastes like."}
{"text":"Some people hate primanti's because they are slow, rude, and the place is usually one level above skanky motel room in cleanliness. These things, I don't really mind when it's 2am and I need greasy, not good for you food. Also, they give free water. What else could you ask for??"}
{"text":"I never saw what the big deal with this place was.  I've lived in the suburbs of Pittsburgh all my life, but have never been to Primanti's til about 10 years ago.  The food is ok, but nothing special.  The sandwiches are ok, but to be honest, I like the Pittsburgh turkey sandwich they serve at Eat n Park with fries and cole slaw on it better than the ones at Primanti's.  I think it's because the fries aren't that great.  I think the atmosphere is definitely better than the food.  The place is definitely \"Pittsburgh\", which is a good thing if you're from here.  If you're not, you might be disappointed by the lackluster food.

I'm not sure what people from other cities think when they come here.  My wife is from a few hours away, and when she moved here, I took her there.  Well, she got the chicken tenders, and not a sandwich.  I said she had to try a sandwich just for the experience, but she thought putting fries and cole slaw on a sandwich was weird and didn't want it.

I'd consider this place more of a bar where you can watch sports rather than a place to come and get a good meal."}
{"text":"Yinnz gotta go n' git one a' dem hootinanny sanchiz. This place is great for one of those drunken excursions. The locals are some of the friendliest folks you'll ever meet, and if you wind up tagging along with them for a night, chances are pretty good you'll wind up here at the end of the night.

These guys don't skimp on the layers of ingredients and they serve beer, which is great if you wanna prime the sandwich with an introduction to what it's gonna be soaking up in your stomach."}
{"text":"Came in at about 11pm and it felt a bit sketch with yelling drunk people outside and inside, but there was a football game on so I guess it's fitting. Asked for a water, got an iced tea. Boyfriend asked for a steak sandwich, for something different and had to wait even longer for his actual sandwich to come. 

Sandwiches were pretty big, I got the corn beef and it was good, fries inside. Might not come back unless I needed a big ass sandwich randomly lol. But we were in Pittsburgh all the way from Toronto, Canada so why not!"}
{"text":"In short a great experience, especially if you are new to Pittsburgh.

My wife and I had never heard of this place before coming to Pittsburgh, but several local people told us it was one of those \"must do\" Pittsburgh stops.  Even though the place was packed, we had a real friendly server who took the time out to tell us the history of the chain and explain the food options. We got a couple great sandwiches and some chili cheese fries (my wife got a vegetarian Deluxe Double Egg & Cheese and I got a Capicola with Cheese and an added egg at the suggestion of the waiter).  

The sandwiches come standard with a vinegary type of coleslaw (not creamy - almost like a fresh mild sauerkraut) and french fries inside, along with whatever else listed.  It was like nothing I have ever had, but after an initial bite or two trying to figure the flavors out, I dove into the sandwich headlong and loved it!  Doubt I will have anything like it anywhere else, it will always be etched in my mind as a part of Pittsburgh - though I hear they are expanding all over the place!"}
{"text":"Only native Pittsburghers like it! I moved to Pittsburgh from the west coast and thought I needed to try Primanti Brothers. I do not understand why this place is so popular here. Everyone that I have talked to from outside of Pittsburgh did not like it."}
{"text":"Woof!!
I moved from the west coast and thought I needed to take visiting family members to try Primanti brothers. None of us liked it. I'm not sure why there are such high reviews. Skip Primanti and go to Gaucho Parilla for a good Sandwich."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are phenomenal.  Came in on a Saturday afternoon and there was a bit of a line to be seated.  The menu on the wall has all the prices listed - sandwiches average $6 - $7.  I went with the salami sandwich and was not disappointed.  All the sandwiches are served on italian bread with french fries and cole slaw on the sandwich.

I did have to deduct two stars because 1) I felt the quality of salami should have been better given that this is a place that serves almost entirely sandwiches and 2) the lil eco-friendly person inside me tinged with guilt drinking from a styrofoam cup.  I mean, even McDonalds stopped using that material in the mid-90s.  I was also seated next to the back door and it seemed as though a large bag of trash was thrown out once a minute.  It just felt a bit wrong."}
{"text":"This Primanti sandwich is way over rated. Had the Last Temptation (I believed that was it was called) that has pastrami and corned beef. The meat was a bit salty. The coleslaw and French fries were good but they did not enhance the taste of the sandwich."}
{"text":"I am a foodie so when I travel, I must try foods that are famous in the city that I visit. So, Primati Bros is a must on my Pittsburgh trip. Well, I was not disappoint after eating their #2 almost famous pittsburger.  Next time, I will try the pastrami. My friend had the pastrami, and it looked tastier."}
{"text":"After living in the burgh for over a year, I finally made my way to a Primantis and truthfully - the food let me down but the atmosphere didn't! I should clarify that because it was late at night, all I ordered was cheese fries and I am anxious to go back and get a sandwich. But there is a lot of hype around their fries and I found them a little soggy and mediocre. My friend got a burger and loved it so that was a win! Our service was really slow considering not many people were there, but I'm a sucker for a yinzer atmosphere and some good brews and I definitely got that. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Like everyone says, you have to try Primanti Bros if you're in Pittsburgh, and I feel like I got the true experience. Massive sandwich, music blasting from the 90s/early 2000s (yes, a bit loud for my tastes but I suppose that's the sports bar vibe they're going for), sports references all over the walls (which went over my head), and a nice waiter who held my hand through my very first Primanti Bros adventure.

After my waiter shared some of the fan favorites, I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich. The bread was super fluffy and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. Can't say I'm a fan of the cole slaw and fries on the sandwich but hey, it's a Pittsburgh tradition! To reiterate, the sandwich is huge; I was stuffed after finishing it."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service with very reasonable price. Sandwiches were stacked high and only cost about $7. They were a bit intimidating at first sight but turned out to be the right size for a hearty meal.  Their signature sandwich includes French fries and cole slaw with onions optional at no additional charge.  The thin bread struggles to hold its hefty load and a fork and knife would have been appreciated.  Overall was very satisfied and would recommend this place at least once."}
{"text":"Guys- it is gross.
No seriously they are going to put cole-slaw in your sandwich.

I occasionally take people here when visiting because it is a famous local Pittsburgish thing. A famous local disgusting thing that I subject my visitors to. I do warn them get the to say no coleslaw. They also put fries in your sandwich - that is more OK with me. They don't really have vegetarian anything at all. 

So go once, and then never again, unless you are subjecting your friends to the experience."}
{"text":"(06/13/2011) We wandered in after a ballgame at PNC Park to try out the famed sandwiches and have a few drinks.  Maybe it was because it was late (11:00 pm), or maybe because we didn't seem like a table that was going to make anyone a lot of money, but we were underwhelmed by the quality of the food and the service.  The stack of bologna, on the Jumbo and cheese, was fried on the outer 2 most slices, and cold in the middle, as were the fries.  I did like the vinegary (not mayonnaise-y) coleslaw, had plenty of black pepper, and the sandwich had plenty of volume.  Can't say I'd recommend them, might try again one day at either a more popular location, or closer to a standard meal time."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and have always heard the stories about Primamti's from friends and The Travel Channel so we decided to hit the original location in the strip district.  I got the Pitts-burger (#2 best seller) with egg.  I wasn't so sure about piling everything on a sandwich but everyone raves about it.

It's definitely a cultural experience! The sandwich was huge and tasty.  I'm fussy about  cole slaw and it did not disappoint. 

The menu tells you the history of how it started and you can hear the pride that the locals have with this place.  We got to see Toni who has been here for decades and was on the segment aired on The Travel Channel. You should definitely stop by and taste what the locals are crazy about!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love grease and beer?!?

The cheese fries and cold Yuengling coupled well together. The sandwich looked amazing as I saw customers savor the taste, but alas I don't eat meat.

I highly recommend this Primanti Bro location and would come back again."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not a Pittsburgher by blood and I couldn't avoid all the hype about this place when I first came to college at UPITT. In one word I would say that this place is a gimmick. The fries aren't great, the slaw is not coleslaw but vinegar-ed and peppered cabbage, meat portions are minuscule... the only thing that's really good about the sandwiches is the bread which varies depending on when you go. On a good day it's super fresh and soft. Pittsburghers love french fries on everything... that's the Pittsburgh way. But there are better combinations and better places to get your Pittsburgh-style cuisine. Eat here to say that you've tried it and then move on to new and better restaurants."}
{"text":"Before we even start, let's be clear about what Primate Bros is...a Pittsburgh cultural landmark. 

That being said...this will NOT be the sandwich that will make you pick up a diet exclusively consisting of meat products and cole slaw. It will however make you an official Pittsburgh-er. You'll \"yinz\" your way out the door while being full on something that feels and tastes like the salt Pittsburgh was built from. 

O...you think that's too poetic for a sandwich?! 

Fair enough. Let's try this...MEAT GOOD. PRIMANTI'S SANDWICH HAVE MEAT. 

Glad we could meet in the middle with that."}
{"text":"I just don't understand how people could \"not\" like Primanti. After a long trip away from Pittsburgh, the first thing I crave upon reentering the city is a Pittsburgher Cheesesteak Sandwich, piled high with coleslaw, tomatoes, fries and an extra egg for perfection. By coleslaw, I don't mean your average drippy mayonnaise coleslaw. Primanti's coleslaw means fresh and crisp. Add a side of Cajun fries and you got yourself a meal of champion. 

They have friendly employees and play good music. It's such a good place to meet up with friends for a casual meal. Enter Primanti expecting a greasy mess...and I'm not even talking about the sandwiches. The floors...stairs...railings...all covered in grease. The whole place is practically a slip and slide. Walk around with caution, but devour your sandwich with passionate rage."}
{"text":"Philly has hoagies and cheesesteaks. Pittsburgh has Primanti's. Sandwiches that include fries and coleslaw in the sandwich. NOT on the side. IN THE SANDWICH. To me, that proof that there is a god. Straight from heaven to my mouth. YUM. They're makin' the sandwiches right behind the bar. You place your order and watch them make it.  Being a Philly guy, there's nothing better than a good hoagie or cheesesteak, but Primanti's iks pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Wow can't believe a sandwich could taste so good. Had the pastrami sandwich. Definitely the right call. The Coke slaw on the sandwich is so good I am left speechless.  Wow is all I can say.  Mozzarella wedges were on point as well. Washed it down with a pumpkin beer and a few comes. Please open one in Miami :-)"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed, I got the pittsburger and I am betting that the burger was a frozen patty. I made sure to go to this place because of everything I have heard about it and I am shaking my head...."}
{"text":"Came all the way from Toronto to have this sandwich. True Pittsburgh classic. The cool coleslaw and the hot fries in the sandwich are an amazing combination ."}
{"text":"We went to a Pirates game and I was ready to grab a sandwich at the Primanti's in the stadium until my friend suggested to hike across the bridge to this location for a better experience. Was not disappointed. The place was packed,but somehow they got people in and out efficiently and got us seated within 20 minutes. I had the Pittsburgh style fish sandwich and it was absolute gold! Sat outdoors, which made for good people watching. Service was super friendly, too."}
{"text":"We wanted to be sure to try this classic Pburgh sandwich. We sat outside under an awning on a rainy evening. The server was friendly and the service was fast. The dirty fries were good and the pastrami sandwich was tasty. I liked the bread texture."}
{"text":"This location has only been open for a little bit but in a span of 3 days they have screwed up my order twice and I don't think I will go back to this location"}
{"text":"I have to start with saying this. I love the reviews where people are like \"I mean like, I like all this stuff but not together. Like, I mean, if it was separated it would be good, I want my fries on the side.\" OK we get it! If you are coming to Pittsburgh to try what you've heard about, then don't be mad when it comes out. Have you ordered a salad, and said \"You know what? I like everything on here, but could you, like, I mean, put everything in separate bowls?\" Sorry my rant is over.

This A home visit must! I love going home to visit because it means that Primanti's is on my list of people I have to see!That's right, I said people! This place is family. I used to hit this place almost every weekend. pastrami add egg. Done. There isn't enough I could say. I will say this. I know there are full restaurants closer to me, but I gotta tell you, nothing beats the original. I (if feasible) will only visit the Strip District location. something about the original that makes it all taste better. AND it's open 24 hours. This is Pittsburgh in a sandwich."}
{"text":"I can see why everyone I knew from Pittsburgh urged me to go here. 
So much Americana. 
And my god, why don't every sandwich shop across the nation offer fries as toppings? I'm also a big fan of cole slaw. So fries, slaw, meat stacked between thick slices of soft italian bread? 
Doesn't even matter meats arent the best quality. 
I got pittsburger and it was just thin regular patties you see in fast food or diner joints but the other stuff are what makes this sandwich great.
Srly a must for anyone new to town! You'll likely crave it when you go back home. 
Anyways I enjoyed every minute of eating that sandwich. And so should everyone. 


Also the staff who were there are very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a dangerous place in the best possible way! The sandwiches are massive and delicious. Fries, coleslaw and cheese and assorted meats all go on top of two giant pieces of white bread. They don't even bother with plates. 

This place was recommended by friends who had eaten here and locals who I talked to. Despite being very famous the place retains its charm, local character and cheap ass drinks! Try the drunk duck. 7.50 for a giant glass of 4 kinds of liqour. (Pictures to follow)"}
{"text":"Consistently great service and good food. It is a bit loud but people have fun here"}
{"text":"I am still trying to figure out how to transport a few sandwiches back on the plane.....There is just something about Pittsburgh and their traditional comfort food!  I have addicted my husband."}
{"text":"I was told that this place from fellow yelpers that Primanti Bros is a Pittsburgh institution, so I really had to try it just because I was a tourist from Hawaii and on my way out of Pittsburgh on a jet plane a few hours later. I made a lunch date here before hitting the airport.

Primanti Bros started out in 1933 in the heart of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in the strip District. Since it's humble beginnings in the northeast, this franchise has blossomed into the institution dad Pittsburgh citizens know I love today. It has been featured on TV shows through The Channel and food network and is definitely the darling of the entire city of Pittsburgh PA. I arrived here on a nice casual Wednesday on a late September day around 1 PM and The restaurant was not really that busy, so I was seated right away. You could tell you were in Pittsburgh PA, just because there was couple of Pittsburgh Steelers banners hanging up in the restaurant. I knew I was in Steelers country already, especially because I was in Miami dolphin fan. But that didn't bother me one bit. I ended up staying here about 45 minutes from ordering to paying the bill, and the results here were pretty darn good and delicious. I did enjoy the service, which was friendly and quick. I'm glad I did not wear any Miami dolphins gear that day, or else I would have gotten dirty looks. Maybe. Maybe not.

The overall experience here at Primanti Bros was quite nice and very bar restaurant like. While I would have liked to have indulged in a few rounds of beer, the better part of me told me otherwise. So, I opted for some soda pop which was in the form of Dr Pepper. It was pretty cool that there was free refills of soda so I ended up getting three refills along with the original order. The restaurant is very clean and very mysterious in a lot of levels just because of the fact that it is a bar and I'm sure it has many stories to tell. Well I would have loved to stay and listen to many of the stories, my experience here was just lunch and I would never have thought I would have been here, if it had not been from advice from fellow Pittsburgh yelpers. Thanks y'all! This Primanti Bros location is located at 4501 Steubenville Pike in Pittsburgh, PA. It's definitely near the Pittsburgh international airport, which you can stop by here for a quick bite before hopping that flight out of Pittsburgh, which I happened to do. There is private parking here, and plenty of it when I was here. While I realize this place is popular, the parking spaces that were already filled up is a testament to why this place is popular. The prices here are decently good, especially for sandwiches! The menu had a lot of good options, but I opted for just the basic sandwich and fries.

I ended up getting the Cajun chicken Sandwich, double meat. That ended up to be about $10 for the meal. Add 4 rounds of Dr Pepper and you have one hell of a calorie bomb that was sure to impress! The sandwich was decently good, although the bread didn't do much for me. It was impressive that the Sandwich presented itself tall and mighty. At the end of the day, it was meant to be eating and eating well. It was definitely delicious although I thought I had expected a little bit better. But still it was decently good. While I would like to have tried other sandwiches, I most likely would have to save it for another visit to Pittsburgh. The french fries were ingrained in the sandwich so they weren't on the side like most other places that serve burgers and fries. I thought that was kind of interesting and weird at the same time, but that's how they are. Being that they are a Pittsburgh institution, I would recommend checking them out, but however to try some of their sandwiches before making a decision, as usual.

Hard to say whether I like this place as a five-star experience, being that I am a Miami fan and they are definitely a Pittsburgh fan. I will have to say, 3.5 stars for the ambiance and 4,0 stars for the meal. The service was 4.0 stars and the restaurant was clean and organized. Check em out in Steelers country.

Support local!

Chris was our server. He was very friendly, and offered some insight on local places to see with limited time in town. We were not disappointed with the food , or the service. Will hit this place up before our travel back home.  Food Great, love being in Pittsburgh to root for my team."}

{"text":"Our first day in town some colleagues of mine went here for dinner. They didn't have anything good to say. Finding that odd with all the Yelp reviews we tried it anyway after the Pirates game. It was about a 10-15 minute easy walk. My buddy and I ordered two sandwiches the capicola and pastrami. They were great! Service was decent, beer was cold (served in plastic cups), it can get crowded, laid back relaxed atmosphere. Worth a stop."}
{"text":"Totally overrated.  I had heard about this place for years but had never eaten there until last weekend.
Under-seasoned? Try NO seasoning.
The corned beef was the most tasteless sandwich I've ever eaten.  Real skimpy on the meat as well. The cheese was barely there. The vaunted fries on the sandwich just made it more bland and soggy. Even the chili cheese fries were bland. 
I did like their bread and the beer was cold.
Overall, a ho-hum experience. 
Next time, we'll go to Peppi's."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good. 

As soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working, and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this \"Pittsburgh\" experience that I've heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed. 

After being seated, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.

The sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards. 

If you're a tourist, go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the \"Pittsburgh\" experience. Apart from that, I don't know why you'd return."}
{"text":"The sandwich was great!  I was visiting Pittsburgh from San Diego. The locals were raving about this place, so my friends and I had to go try it. We were very satisfied here. The staff was a little rude, but rude in a funny way.  My buddy ask for no coleslaw on his sandwich and the waiter stopped writing his order and yelled at him, \"What the F@#$  do you mean you want no cole slaw!\"  It was hilarious. 
I highly recommend this place for out-of-towners!!!!"}
{"text":"Huge sandwhich with everything you could ask for on it! Delisious, filling and had half left over. Loved the environment. Really crouded and busy but it makes you feel alive if that makes sence!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cincinnati. By nature I'm supposed to hate Pittsburgh. However, I've had an obsession with Jordan Staal since I was 12, I took a college visit to the U of Pitt, and I DEFINITELY prefer a Primanti Bros sandwich over a 3 way anyday.

Chillax, I'm not horny; a 3 way is a Cinci \"delicacy\" featuring spaghetti topped with a very thin chili and cheese. Calm down children.

Anywhoo, whilst making this visit to Pittsburgh, I told my padre it was absolutely necessary we eat here. Why? I've seen Adam Richman, Guy Fieri and every other chubby traveling food dude drool over these. I wanted one. Bad.

When you walk in, it's a dive, for sure. Seat yourself, everyone's in sweats, eatin a big hunk o' meat stuffed with french fries and coleslaw.

An Ohio girl can get used to this.

At the (also very chillax) waitress's recommendation I took Cappacola, which apparently is a Pittsburgh tradition. My dad took the Tuna Fish, and we waited...ten minutes. My food is here. And it looks AWESOME. My first bite was, orgasmic. Yes, orgasmic. This sandwich turns me on.

Sorry 3 way.

But this...sandwich...is...amazzzzzzzzzzzing! It's spicy, it's crunchy, it's sweet, it's salty, it's...hey there's bread too! ALL IN ONE. My dad also enjoyed his sandwich, at least I think he did. I'm not quite sure. I was into this love affair way too much. If this were considered cheating on a boyfriend, I would cheat. Every week. Maybe everyday, depending on how often I can get to this sandwich.

I love this sandwich. You will too. You will also be full. Oh so very full. You will have coleslaw coming off your chin and french fries overflowing your basket after you're done. And if you do not finish, you will take it home, or to your hotel, or to the spirit shop down the street and munch on the leftover french fries while the cashiers aren't looking because you're not supposed to be eating in there. (SSH!)

It's THAT good.

P.S.: I got a pen that says Primanti Bros on it. Yeah. Be jealous."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh and the Uber driver suggested I check this place out. And I did! It worked out perfectly because i was sooo hungry that evening after a day of traveling. I got 'the last temptation' sandwich which had pastrami, corned beef, coleslaw and fries between the bread. It was a huge sandwich, and oh so good! I enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"The bf and I decided we had to try Primanti Bros just to see what the hype was all about. I mean, it was even featured on the Food Network.

But seriously? WAAAY overhyped. I'm so glad we decided to split a sandwich (we ordered the Cheese Steak). Basically, they stuck a hamburger bun in-between two pieces of white bread. Add to that, some very mayo'd up coleslaw and soggy fries. Overall, I was just very disappointed.

Conclusion: FATHEADS is where it's really at!"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros dot the landscape around Pittsburgh, but this one just happened to be conveniently located near the airport in Moon township (and yes, there's also a Mars township north of Pittsburgh), and thus avoiding the usual crowd. But while the location is not exactly crowd-free (as with their any other locations) the service was attentive and prompt. Seafood sandwich is the choice of the day so we decided to give it a try.... and it was seriously delicious! The fish was nicely cooked and breaded, and the portion is generous (I almost wanted to ask the server if there's mistake -- for $5 that cannot be beat!)  The sauce and the sandwich however, is perfectly blended and extremely tasty! I've only visited the original Primanti Bros at the Strip District before, and never tried the fish sandwich, so this is a pleasant surprise! They indeed live up to their reputation."}
{"text":"Been waiting a while to try this place since seeing it in TV. Was finally in Pittsburgh and went to the original. It didn't disappoint. The service was great and the food even better. A bit greasy, but that's what your getting into. The ingredients were fresh and it's definitely a city staple. I even grabbed another sandwich at PNC park while watching a game. Can't say much about the other locations, but if you can, head to the original."}
{"text":"This was a real treat.  Watch the visits on TV from that one Travel Chanel guy who's name will be not said, but you know who I am talking about.  It was good and the ladies working the place made the place.  So happy I finally got to go there."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm.  I heart Primantis! 

My favorite Primantis sandwich is certainly the Cajun chicken. It's a nice amount of spice on the chicken, and it's always cooked perfectly, not dried out or overcooked. The fries and coleslaw on the sandwich make it for me. The bread they use is always so soft and delicious! Their pecan pie is huge (1/4 of a pie!) and pretty amazingly tasty. My kids always enjoy their kids meals and the atmosphere is loud enough to accommodate kids nicely! 

They give moms free food on Mother's Day and dads free food on Father's Day, so it's become our new tradition for me for Mother's Day! Yay!"}
{"text":"Oh baby!! This is a must go to place to visit in Pittsburgh.
This sandwiches are my greatest weakness. They are to die for!! Now yes they may be one of the most unhealthy things that you will ever put into your body but it is so worth it!!
These sandwiches are made with sliced Italian bread,  your choice of meat or fish then they put provolone cheese, yummy coleslaw and fries on top... heaven!!! 
Now one thing to keep in mind about this Primanti Brothers is that this is the original location so it is very old and they bathrooms are in the basement they are very creepy but that just adds a little character to the place."}
{"text":"I was told I had to go here. Steak sandwich was just OK at best (I'm not a fan of their cole slaw) after hot sauce and ketchup. They had 24 oz Yuenglings for next to nothing, which is enough for me, as I can only get Lagers when I head out east."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location 10 stars!! This is the best one for sure! From the fresh slices of bread NOT toasted! Yes, that's how us Yinzers like it. And for the Midwest weirdos us Yinzers don't want you here so stay in your cornfields. Bahaha The french fries are perfect. Everything about Primanti's is perfect! I wouldn't change a thing!!!"}
{"text":"The family came here from Southern California and we loved the atmosphere, fun staff and good food.  I had the Ragin Cajun sandwich, which was good, but the Pastrami has a nice smokey flavor and nothing here was small.  Definitely a must when in Pittsburgh, great historical location you have to experience."}
{"text":"When I told people I would be visiting Pittsburgh I was told I had to try Primanti Bros.  French fries on a sandwich sounded good to me.  What I got was not at all what I was expecting. While the sandwich was big it was kind of bland with soggy no so good fries.  I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  

I do have to say they have an excellent happy hour with half price pints that goes to 11:00 on a Saturday night. They also have a nice selection of craft beer on tap.  Our waitress was also very friendly.  If I lived in the area I would probably only go back for the happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't like cole slaw ... so each and every time I ask for no cole slaw I get a dirty look.  Service is usually hit or missed and directly correlated with how busy it is, although a couple of non-busy times I could have sworn my distaste for cole slaw caused our service to be lacking.

So let's get to the food.  I've had better bread.  I've had better fries.  So I can't justify the dollars to taste ratio for this particular establishment.  So many of my friends swear by this place and it just boggles my mind that I can't be moved by it.  Yeah, I'll give it another shot or two ... but so far I'm just not impressed."}
{"text":"Everyone was raving about this place and out of our group of 5 only one person enjoyed the food. The waiter, possibly manager, was rude. The restaurant was a dump and we had not even ordered our food. I can forgive the ambience and rudeness if the food was good, but as you can tell by my rating it was awful. I ordered a cheese steak (#2 seller) and the meat was a brick patty that tasted like processed or canned meat. I am not a fan of coleslaw at all so I asked for that on the side. The rude waiter brought my everything out on the side. Picture this a slab of meat on some soft bread with cheese. Attention to detail in my order goes a long way. I attribute that to him being rude so I'll let that slide. I will say, considering I am not a fan of coleslaw that was the best part of the meal. In other words that was the only thing I ate. Considering I can pretty much eat anything, this place was just terrible. Oh ya, this place only takes cash. Stop being cheap and if you are a chain restaurant then have the option for credit!! Otherwise you go to their ATM in the restaurant and pay the 3.50 service fee. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in Pittsburgh I have to stop! Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of Pittsburgh's food destinations. And it's really poor."}
{"text":"Took the family and enjoyed the experience. We had the steak/cheese, the kielbasa/cheese,  and sweet sausage/ cheese sandwiches. Great food--loved the pub pickles! Service somewhat lacking but great experience overall. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere downtown. Staff was cool and they were constantly busy. More importantly, the food was really good. They messed up my sandwich and made me a whole new one. I really enjoyed this place. Prices were cheap and it was an overall great experience. Go Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I went to the Primanti's in Harmar when we moved to Pittsburgh and since it had been a while, we decided to try it out again. Maybe the wonderful drinks from Maggie's Farm Rum helped us make that decision.

Even at 2:30 pm on Saturday, it was packed. I would have expected this around lunch, but didn't think it would be so crowded that late. We only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated.The tables are pretty close together so you feel really packed in there. Our order was taken quickly and food arrived fast too.

My boyfriend got the fish sandwich(without coleslaw) and I got the Pitts-burger. The fries are crispier than I expected. I thought they would be soggy from the coleslaw, but they weren't. The coleslaw is vinegary and there was lots. My boyfriend's fish was crispy and hot and delicious. There are better fish sandwiches in Pittsburgh, but this one can definitely fill a craving. The burger was a little disappointing. It was more like a weird meat patty than a burger, and after trying the fish sandwich, I realized how cool the meat was. It was like they just pulled it out of a bin.

The bread was really good. Soft and fluffy, but it sort of seemed like the bread wasn't substantial enough to handle the large sandwich. But maybe it's a good thing since the sandwich would be too filling.

It's a good place to take out of towners to try and worth trying every now and then just because Primanti's is Pittsburgh, but it's not the best food you can find."}
{"text":"This is the very first place I went when I moved to Pittsburgh and this Primantis is definitely my favorite.

My favorite menu items are the cheese combo sandwich and the garden patch salad w/ fries on top.

The pizza is okay, and their pierogies are pretty good, and the cheese sticks are worth a try, but it's all about the sandwiches and salads.

You haven't lived until you've had a sandwich with cole slaw and french fries on it."}
{"text":"So I found myself in Pittsburgh last weekend visiting an ex who was in town working at the Pittsburgh Auto Show. I recalled seeing a famous Pitt sandwich shop on Food TV and did a little research. I found that the original Primanti Bros. was down on 18th and decided to take a walk down from the Westin for lunch. I took the approx 15 min walk down Penn Ave and finally found the restaurant around a corner in what turned out to be the \"Strip district\". The Strip was crowded, grungy, ugly, and full of cheap ($3 & $5) Steelers shirts and \"Terrible Towels\". Something about terrible towels irritates me to no end (and Steelers fans in general, maybe because I had a roommate for a bit who was a total jackass and loved them...and I'm a Pats fan!). Street Vendors lined the sidewalks hawking mostly junk ($1 finger puppets!) as locals and tourists bustled around making Valentines day purchases. There were plenty of gritty locals selling flowers out of buckets and trash pals on the sidewalks in-between the cheap t-shirt tables. There were some cool shops and eateries bunched in, overall a scene I am not opposed to at all!

So I got to Primantis, opened the door to see a line right in front of me about 15 or so deep, I found the end and began to wait. A family coming in behind me were obviously Primanti virgins as well and asked me 20 questions about what to do now that they were there. After about 20 mins I was at the front and was shown a seat at the bar. I was delighted to see Yeunling Lager available as it brought me back a few years. It is brewed in PA and FL, I worked on a trail crew in FL for a bit and would buy plenty of it with my $40/week stipend, actually beer was all I bought on that money The beer is not available in CT or MA to my knowledge. I started on my bottle of Yeunling and got an order in 15 mins or so later. I chose the regular sized 'fish and cheese'. I do not eat 'meat' otherwise I would have gone for the steak or pastrami that seem to be the favs. I soon discovered the couples on either side of me at the bar were also new to the place and had also seen it on Food TV and had made it a destination. Have you had one??? they asked with a tinge of excitement and curiosity in their voices! 

About 20-30 mins later we all found out what the fuss was about. Well the sandwich didn't look as magical as I would have been led to believe with all the out of towners ooohing and ahhing but it looked good and I was hungry. I squeezed down to prevent filling leakage and bit in....mmm. Now I'm not a cole slaw fan but it was obvious upon first bite the slaw made the sandwich. I can't lie, being that the only animal I eat is fishes and almost all of my friends and coworkers eat meat I am ordering a fish sandwich pretty often at places I don't necessarily choose but go to frequently. So french fries and fried fish has to be pretty special to surprise me, these did not surprise but throw them together with the slaw on the white Italian bread and you have a very tasty sandwich. The fries were slightly soggy, not salty, not hot, limp and bland would describe them well with a pleasant taste. The taste of the fish did not stand out much over the slaw, The slaw was exclusively cabbage to the best of my memory. It was tangy and acidic and packed a flavor punch compared to the bland fries, bread and fish. 

The sandwich was messy and losing components on each bite, which fell onto the deli paper it was served on. Luckily the napkins were right in front of me and became a hot item with the neighbors as well. Normally I don't like a loose, avalanche prone sandwich but it did not bother me here as the 'sloppiness' was part of the charm. The waitresses carried piles of sandwiches around separated only by the deli paper. The room had a warm character and felt like people had been enjoying warm messy sandwiches and beer there for a long time. It was slightly dark and extremely crowded, but not a bad crowded as everyone was happy to be there eating a famous sandwich. When you are done you walk to the end of the bar, tell whoever happens to be standing there what you had (honor system!) and pay under $10 for a sandwich and a beer! 

On my way out I ordered a sandwich to go as I was meeting my ex on her short lunch break. I grabbed her the 'Rajun Cajun Chicken\"  which she enjoyed but commented on the soggy nature, which I am sure was compounded by being wrapped 45mins previous to being eaten. When I walked out the door there was line wrapped all the way to the side of the building approx. 50 people deep. I believe it was snowing at this point and in the 30's, so I was impressed by the will of the people to obtain sandwich royalty. In the end I thought it was a fun experience and a tasty sandwich. If I am back in Pitt I will certainly consider going back for a bite. If I am eating meat again at that point I would anticipate being more delighted by the Primanti Bros. Check it out, embrace it."}
{"text":"Stopped in at original location on on August 21. Doing the college tour with my son our travels took us 30 miles from Pittsburgh so we figured we had to make the detour. Had the Pitts-burger and the pastrami. Both good but I felt the fries and slaw worked much better with the burger. Clean place with very friendly and attentive staff. Definitely worth the trip. If you're in the area even 30 miles out like us, make the trip. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ew. Food was cheap and bland.  (bread was like wonder bread hiding as a roll, cheese was cheap and barely melted, meat was flavorless)  Not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Standard college dive burger bar. They put the fries and cole slaw into the sandwich, which was an interesting idea. Turned out to be okay but the bread did not have the crunch that I had hoped and the fries were a little soggy. The service was very slow and it was extremely unclear where to order from. Also, some of the menu items are only displayed on a different wall."}
{"text":"i know this place is semi-famous, i think especially after jake gyllenhall (sp?) talked about it on leno, but what is the big deal??? i just don't understand. cole slaw? fries? big whoop."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich just like all the hype.  I got the pastrami & it was delicious.  Would've liked more meat, but next time I'll get double.  Our waitress was very attentive & great with our kids.  We will definitely be going again next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Sandwiches generally dry and not the best ingredients. Good if youve been drinking and nothing else is open."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a Primanti Bros sandwich!
My son & I were flying into Pittsburgh to visit family. With a 90+minute drive from airport, we decided to find a location en route.  When placing order, I mentioned our (now 50-min) trek. She arranged for all to be packed \"for travel\",  aside from the one my son ate on the road, so they wouldn't be soggy upon arrival.
Made with love & packed as if an employee was taking it home themself. Always on my list when visiting (or travelling through) the Pittsburgh area!!"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros

Highly heralded as THE sandwich place in Pittsburgh, we had to try it out and we went to the one on 18th street where there was a line out the door the day before. It's open 24 hours so the line wont be there all day. 

Street parking makes it tricky if you want to pick up something  quick. One of us stayed in the car around the corner while the other went it to order to make it easier.

We ordered the burger cheesesteak with a fried egg and the roast beef with cheese subs.  The sandwiches come with fries IN the sandwich, and it is rumored that they get irked if you ask for them separate. 

The white bread is soft and fresh on both sandwiches. The roast beef sandwich was better but was missing the cheese or we could not really taste it; next time we would ask for extra cheese to really taste it.
The fried egg made the burger cheesesteak but still lacked any real flavor. While the ingredients are good and the flavor of the and portions are satisfying, their was a muted feel to both. 
I think we need to give this place another try before passing final judgement but it was not as impressive as it was made out to be..."}
{"text":"downgraded to 1.5 stars.

After hearing raving reviews, I decide to give this place a shot. 

I walked in and sat at the bar.  The cook was standing there looking at his phone and didn't greet us until we said something(all the while still looking at his phone).

I decided to get the corned beef sandwich since it was recommended to me by some people.  Easy on the coleslaw and fries.  I also tried their chili.

Even being easy on the coleslaw and fries, it was a pretty big sandwich.  The fries and coleslaw definitely overshadowed the corned beef.  The sandwich was decent but definitely not amazing as some reviews would say.  The fries could have been cooked a little bit longer imo.

Update:
I didn't want to do a complete update as I only went back for the \"almost famous chili\" the 2nd time around.  I have to say they totally butchered the chili.  It's probably \"almost famous\" for being the worst made chili ever. It was practically tomato soup with onions.  VERY little beans and beef.  I wouldn't even call this chili.  Sorry but if a fast food joint like Wendy's can make better and heartier chili than this place, something is wrong.  The only thing they got right was the bread and butter.  

This place is just a novelty eats imo."}
{"text":"I'm not really much of a sandwich guy but being in Pittsburgh this is \"the\" thing to do.

Being a Philadelphian, its easy for most Philadelphians to eschew any cheese-steak attempt by outsiders.  However, I'm not going to do that here since anything served on slices of white bread cannot be considered a cheese-steak.  This review is of a sandwich and not a cheese-steak attempt.

I had the angus cheese-steak.  I'd say taste wise, this is more of a two star place but they deserve an extra star for originality with the fries in the sandwich.  The fries (although slightly undercooked and very soggy) add an interesting dynamic to a sandwich.  The meat was very much on the small scale but was cooked just fine.

Overall, I'd definitely say its a place to be visited if you haven't had it before but I can totally see why my Pittsburgh native friend hadn't had a sandwich there in over 5 years."}
{"text":"Best it go just before 2am or just after 3am. Avoid the drunks. But still a great place to grab a sandwich after a drunken night in the town. I normally go after work when the bars have let out so I know the timing and even see people I had to deal with that very night.

I love the corn beef Ruben. It's not a real Ruben but still a great remake of it. Piled with fries and coleslaw. The bread is always fresh and the food comes out fast. The worst part about this place is the drunks. If you can make it though them your in for an awesome hot sandwich for a good price."}
{"text":"So (and I'm probably going to be stoned for committing a sin after admitting this) I still have not eaten at the original Primanti's. Sorry, guys! But I have eaten at the one in Oakland, and now, I've eaten at the one in Mt. Lebanon near where I live. The last one is the one I'm reviewing today.

And, well...it's certainly not bad. I'm probably a bit biased because there were some major problems the night I was there. In fairness, the restaurant itself is quite nice. It's spacious (MUCH more spacious than the one in Oakland), clean, and most notably it's decorated in an odd and interesting manner; for example, there's a Steelers scarf wrapped around the neck of a mounted Elk head in there. The scarf I get, but...really, an elk head? In Pittsburgh?

The food is delicious, of course, although not something I would eat all the time - way too much fat and salt. (Would we ever expect anything else from Primanti's?) I would definitely prefer to have all of my Primanti's meals here, though, due to the additional seating space. Plus, there's the extended menu that includes foods like gyros and other sandwiches, which I know aren't typically available at other Primanti's. I definitely prefer the expanded menu here - I even ordered a gyro off of it during this visit. Sure, I get that Primanti's is all about the french fries and coleslaw covered sandwich, but it's still good to have the other options, at least to me. I think it can make a first-time meal at Primanti's a lot less bizarre and even more enjoyable, especially for out of towners. In this case, my friend wanted to eat at Primanti's for old time's sake since she used to live here, but I didn't particularly want a Primanti's sandwich that night, so I got my gyro instead; my friend got her sandwich, and everyone left happy.

Well, mostly happy. There's a reason this place is just \"a-ok\" to me. My problem has more to do with the fact that the service my friend and I got during our dinner was very mediocre, and this is a complaint I've heard from other critics of the place as well so I doubt it was just me. Our server failed to bring us the water we ordered when she brought our other drinks, and we ended up eventually getting it after asking a third time - long after our food and alcohol had been consumed. She then never came back to check on us after that, and so after an hour of just chatting (which admittedly my friend and I didn't mind, we were catching up after not seeing each other for four years), we ended up grabbing another waitress so they could find ours.

I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could because they're better than \"a-ok\" but they're not quite at the \"yeah I'm definitely a fan\" level, either. It's worth going here if you're nearby and you have the time. The food is definitely what you'd expect from a Primanti's, and perhaps it's even better thanks to the menu additions. It's just the potential service delays that may put a damper on your experience here."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is the sort of local haunt they show during football telecasts before and after commercials, where people are shoving down enormous sandwiches, contents dripping out all over the place. 

A few weeks ago, after a lot of anticipation, I got the chance to eat just like that and man it was good.  A big part of the appeal is the ability to know what people are talking about when they mention Primanti's and Pittsburgh in the same breath.  The sandwich was really satisfying, not legendary, but it definitely left me a happy customer.  The real draw is the feel of the neighborhood, the weathered dining room and the short-winded wait staff.  The sandwich is just something to do while your taking it all in.

I thought the coleslaw-fry-pastrami-sandwich-beast was going to put me to sleep, but it wasn't even that filling.  The fluffy white bread really gave intimidating size impression, but you'll be able to finish it off no problem."}
{"text":"We were told to visit the ORIGINAL Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh, so we did.  Wow! It really is a totally different experience.  The food was so good and the atmosphere and history was really cool.  The food honestly speaks for itself, but the experience is what this location is all about.  There is parking at the restaurant, but there's plenty of parking all around.  It's a neat area to visit, we wouldn't have gone there if it hadn't been for Primanti Bros!"}
{"text":"if i could only choose between eating crispy fries or soggy fries for the rest of my life, i would choose soggy fries in a heartbeat. yes, i am one of those.

however, my plan would fail if i ever found myself on a deserted island with all the fixings to build a primanti sammich. the fries that come in the sandwiches are soggy, and that was actually my bigger problem more than anything. it tasted like a potato paste..and i just wasn't into it.

i went for the jumbo baloney (that's how it was spelled on the board) and cheese. the only \"jumbo\" part about it was the fact that it was piled high..but not with meat. for the record, the baloney was delicious, but it was SERIOUSLY lacking in quantity. the sandwich, already at $5.59, would require an extra $1.99 for more meat. are you kidding?? having said that, they actually *do* pile the pastrami high on their pastrami sandwich, and BOY is it divine. it deserved every zoom shot and song of praise in all the foodie television shows it has received.

the cole slaw (vinegar-based, not cream-based..which is probably a smart idea for these sandwiches) was tangy and plentiful. let's put it this way: even though it made up about 70% of sandwich content, i actually picked up the little shreds that fell out because it was that good.

cash only is a little annoying, but there's an atm at the entrance. the service isn't spectacular but it wasn't awful, either. i'd definitely go back for a second try."}
{"text":"Good food, Fast friendly service and a healthy discount for firefighters and police (%50)."}
{"text":"Due to a late night dinner gone wrong, I ended up stopping by this Primanti Brother's.  I ordered a Capicola and Cheese sandwich to go. It was less than $7 and took no more than 5 minutes to make!

It was a large restaurant. They separated the bar + seating area in one room, and a probably more family oriented seating area in another.  It was very popular and I had to try what seems to be a famous sandwich from Primanti Brothers!

This is certainly a unique sandwich! I can barley hold it let alone take a bite that doesn't leave my face covered with coleslaw.  Between 2 whopping slices of bread are french fries (yes, french fries), coleslaw, capicola, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes! You either need a huge appetite to finish this sandwich or split the sandwich and share it."}
{"text":"AThere isn't a Primanti Bros. in NY and with everyone in Pittsburgh praising their food (and me loving food), I had to give this place a try. When you enter, you're welcomed with a more \"at home\", relaxed vibe than say an Applebee's or Outback Steakhouse. It's spacious and doesn't feel cramped. Dress code...what dress code? Just come as comfortable as you'd like. :) Perfect for families or super cool and friendly dates.  Although I didn't dine in and opted rather for takeout - I was given a full dose of in-house service. If it's a particular busy day, be prepared to sort of awkwardly wait at the front entrance until someone sees you. For me, once that happened, everything else was pretty much smooth sailing. Service was efficient and friendly. Order was for the chicken club sandwich and fries, 9 inch pizza, and pecan pie.  :) When we reached back to the hotel, I understood why so many people go bonkers for this place. First, portion. Huge, huge portions. Secondly, taste. Not overly seasoned but packs enough punch to leave you incredibly full and satisfied. Pricing seemed reasonable and along with the service we received, worth it. They don't skimp on any ingredients either. Everything was full and brimming over. Will definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Well, it finally happened: I had to give a place a single star. And it kills me that the place I gave it to had to be Primanti's. I'm an awful Pittsburgher.

I don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. 

Alas, that's all I liked.

So, why such a low score? Well:

The service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, \"Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order.\" 

And not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.

To make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.

Before you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time. I certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if I spot my previous, downright awful waiter working there again."}
{"text":"If you know primanit's and like their food, this one is as great as the next one. I'm personally not a fan of their Pizza however. Love their sandwiches always. And a fun, friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in to give it another try. The waitress was nice but wasn't allowed to serve alcohol because my 37 year old friend forgot his ID BUT HAD NO INTENTIONS OF DRINKING. We have been there many times before and a manager could have stopped over to explain. I left very angry."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are HUGE!!!  If you walk away hungry here, then you must have an unquenchable hunger."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland, nothing had seasoning, not even basic salt. Soggy fries, tasteless meat, average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for Italian bread. Save your time, money and calories and go to Wendy's instead."}
{"text":"I crave Primanti's on a fairly regular basis. Having gone to college in Pittsburgh, it was a staple for 2:00pm breakfasts after a late night. A sandwich (and a beer) always made me feel a lot better. I like mine with either capicola, turkey, corned beef, or pastrami. I'm not that picky and they're all really good. No matter what, I always get it with a fried egg on top (a must!). The fries and cole slaw, on their own, would be alright (not great). However, jammed together on the bread, with grilled meat and egg, it's out of this world. We make a healthier version at home, which is just about as good. Every time I'm back in the area, I always make a point to stop in at one of their locations."}
{"text":"Yes, I had the all famous Cheesesteak stuffed with fries and coleslaw. Yes, it was awesome. Yes, my stomach was very unhappy afterwards. Yes, I'd eat it again!"}
{"text":"Went there since it is a Pittsburgh tradition. Great place for a good sandwich (with french fries on it) and a good draft beer. Not spectacularly amazing, but not bad at all. A-OK it is. 

I got the pastrami sandwich at a good price and a good amount for a meal. The french fries on the sandwich felt somewhat cold, but not terrible. Service was good in general."}
{"text":"This is the first time I went to the new waterfront location.  I didn't regret it.

There were a few differences from the original strip location.  It had a more sports bar like feel with large screens in every direction.  There was also a large bar located at the center serving drinks.  There were also a few items added to the original menu, such as wings, and a few 'tall' sandwiches which are basically more elaborate versions of their original sandwiches.

Pros:
- Awesome wait staff.  Didn't get the name of my waitress but she was one of the most attentive and warm wait staff I met in recent memory.
- Better ambiance with large window panels with a nice view outside.
- More menu items.  I had the New Yorker which is basically a reuben made primanti style (meaning a dollop of fries inside).  It was pretty good.  I'd have it again.

Cons:
- Wings were a bit of a disappointment.  Had the boneless wings because they had a special going on.  Tasted a bit stale and also the chipotle maple sauce was too strong for me."}
{"text":"This place was cool! I took my dad when he was in town. I knew he'd love the piled high sandwiches. 

I got the Ruben and it was awesome. Toasted, the right amount of sauce and the corned beef was delicious. I would go back for it in a second. 

The service was fast and ordering was easy. Plus the food is good and filling. It's a nice quick stop."}
{"text":"Ok. We did it. 

Came here mid-afternoon and still had a line...I thought that was a good sign. Sometimes a deli type place doesn't have alcohol, they had a decent bottled beer selection, so +1 there...

As for the main attraction...the sammiches... We tried three of them...

All of them feature thick white/italian bread a pile of fries, a pile of slaw, a couple tomatoes and then you basically are just picking which meat you want to be under that pile...

Pittsburgher - the worst of the three, a very bad burger, I'd prefer a middle school lunch patty.

Jumbo (Bologna) - this actually went well with the pile of stuff and acted as a nice complement, If I was go come again I'd strongly consider this one.

The Capone- this had multiple different meats and was ridiculous just on sheer volume... It wasn't bad, but I'd never try it again...

So, if you've never been you should definitely go, it's worth it for the experience and sheer largesse at very fair prices, but I don't expect I'll hit it again unless I come back with someone who's never been...."}
{"text":"The sandwich is very average. I had the Cajun chicken sandwich. Bread was not toasted and the coleslaw was very tasteless... The price was reasonable and we say outdoor which was pleasant. 
Great location"}
{"text":"I had heard all about this place from everyone when I said I was going to Pittsburgh for the weekend.  It was an interesting experience.  I got the Capicola and cheese and HOLY SANDWHICH BATMAN!  This thing was huge!  I made the mistake of ordering the fried pickles and a side of fries too because this sandwich alone would have done me in for a day.  Very flavorful and I would go again for sure."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Primanti Brothers, I usually going to the one by South Hills Village. I always have an egg on my sandwich and order a cup of chili with the works! 

The chili has a kick that just hits the spot and warms you up on this cold days.

If you are visit Pitttsburgh you have to try Primanti Brothers, it's a Burgh Thing."}
{"text":"I was super leery of a sandwich with slaw and onions and fries on it but went with the flow and it was excellent. I don't even like slaw usually but this one had me eating it even past when I was full.  I did have to ask for a fork because the thing was massive but they didn't mock me for it.  Service was quick and friendly. I felt like a local in a place I had never been before."}
{"text":"You know what? I'm gonna go ahead and give this place a five star rating. Yeah its touristy and kinda cliché, so what? Let me elaborate on why I think this place deserves five stars before people start thinking I hand out five star reviews like candy on Halloween. 

Came here for dinner while recently visiting Pittsburgh for the very first time. Got here around 5 PM and the place was pretty busy and crowded. Even though it was busy I was greeted immediately by a friendly lady behind the counter who informed me they would clear a table off ASAP for us. Waited a couple minutes and a lot more people came in behind us. They were promptly greeted as well. When some random guy came in and tried to completely bypass the line he was immediately sent to the back of the line by the workers. Friendly and efficient yet not afraid to put trolls in their place. I like it. 

After a few minutes we were seated and our drink orders taken. When the waiter returned he took our sandwich order. I went with the pastrami and cheese sandwich. If you don't already know the standard sandwich at Primanti Brothers comes with your choice of meat, cheese, coleslaw, and fries all stuffed in the sandwich. Sandwiches were pretty good sized and having your fries and coleslaw put into the sandwich is awesome! The bread used was super fresh, the pastrami was top notch, coleslaw is super fresh, and the fries are clearly fresh cut. The sandwich is so unique and good that its a real winner. Prices are great too. Pretty much all the sandwiches run from 6 to 8 bucks. Food came out pretty fast and our waiter was a cool guy that had no problem chatting us up and giving us recommendations for great local hangouts amongst the hustle and bustle of dinnertime at this iconic spot.

Atmosphere is great here too. The place has that old deli feel with a lunch counter you can sit at as well as tables. The walls are adorned with all kinds of old signs and sports decor. Their menu is painted large and bright on the wall which makes ordering easy. Also, i want to make note that there are tons of Primanti Brothers locations in and around Pittsburgh but this one is the original. This is THE Primanti Brothers. 

Great food, great atmosphere, solid service, reasonable prices, and cool people working here. There is absolutely no reason to dock any stars off this place. So, here ya go Primantis five stars for you. Can't wait to get back here for another sandwich."}
{"text":"primanti bros. aka death row. 
i came here with my mom, brother and boyfriend, were all from philly, my mom brother and i were COMPLETELY repulsed-my boyfriend loved it.
it is practically death in a sandwich-completely terrible. the waitress had her pants so low you could see some unwanted characteristics. this was not a meal to remember but simply forget-ughh it was terrible. unless you want to throw up immediately-go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"You always here about the main location on the travel channel.  The is a Pittsburgh most do when you visit. Ensure you bring a big appetite as the sandwiches are as big as they advertise.  You can't go wrong bread, meat,slaw and fries. Food was great and I couldn't finish the sandwich in one sitting."}
{"text":"Being from Pittsburgh I have to appreciate this home-town brand.  The sandwiches are loaded with your favorite meat and even fries...Definitely check it out when you're in town."}
{"text":"We had the Southwest Vegetarian Black Bean sandwich and it was okay. They don't have any other vegetarian options. We also tried the fried pickles and they were not fried correctly they were very chewy. Just something to mention they don't use plates they give the sandwich on a parchment paper so that it's easier to wrap up. Also the place was unclean at times as they were only two guys for the entire restaurant. I had heard a lot and was told to visit this place but my visit was nothing special. It is right in the heart of Market Square but we were there on Easter so everything was closed"}
{"text":"I was very excited to go here because of all the buzz about this place.  To be honest this place was not that good at all.  The sandwiches, although unique, were not that good. It was all french fries and very little meat.  My husband and I were almost mad at how little meat was on the sandwiches.  We won't be going back but at least we experienced it."}
{"text":"First time here after hearing about it for years during football games. A++++, great food, service, and prices. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"a food staple of pittsburgh. i always encourage tourists to stop here."}
{"text":"Several people said I had to go here during my first-ever visit to Pittsburgh so I obliged. Whoa, I've never been this confused about why a place gets such high recommendations. 

Upon entry, expect a chaotic atmosphere. We were first told to find a seat ourselves, but then were told to be seated. Once seated, we waited for several minutes before anyone came by to ask us anything. However, after the first staff member showed up, another two came by within two minutes to ask us for our order as well. 

The food was okay, nothing spectacular. The one interesting part was that the fries came stuffed in the sandwich. As for the taste, really nothing out of the ordinary.

Why this place is so popular will remain a mystery to me. Was it worth going just to say I had gone?  Not really."}
{"text":"The idea of a sandwich with fries on it is great, and the prices are good, but I was a little disappointed by the actual quality of the sandwich.  They're definitely cutting costs by putting minimal meat on the sandwiches, and they're not using good meat, either.  (I had the corned beef; some of the other meats might be good.  Personally, I want to try the sardine sandwich just to say that I ate it.)

On the plus side, the slaw is really good - nice and tangy.  It's better than most of what I had in the South where they take great pride in their slaws.

Again, this is another Pittsburgh place that doesn't take credit cards.  You're directed to an ATM in the foyer; can anyone else tell that the not-taking-cards thing here is really starting to annoy me?"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because of comments so this is a Warning: over rated. Low quality meat. Service okay. Half my sandwich had no meat. Burger meat was like Salisbury steak, just not what I expected. Try some where else."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Original!

For any of you other interlopers: Expect a MASSIVE sandwich filled with fries and slaw.  The slaw isn't southern style- more of an oil and vinegar type that's not very runny.  Went with a friend who said he hated coleslaw and liked it!

This location is CASH ONLY and parking can get a little rough during busier hours.

We went at 9am and had sandwiches, beer, and zero issues.

Something anyone not from Pittsburgh should definitely take the time to check out.  And seriously: listen to your local friends.  This paricular location DOES taste different than the others!"}
{"text":"This place is a Pittsburgh staple and must be on your list if you are visiting the Burgh! I've been coming here and the other locations every time I visit PA since I was a kid. I love the Pittsburger with everything on it! I'm never disappointed as the food is always good and no matter what York you go since it's open 24 hours a day someone is always there enjoying the grub! Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich. Old school area love it. Would give it 3 1/2 stars. Have to give it a try world famous."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich, like the area that it's in. Old school. Have to give it a try thou. World famous. I would give it a 3 and 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"It's a Pittsburgh institution. You know it by heart. Fries and slaw on all the sandwiches. The locals love it. It's revered nationwide. Perhaps even larger than that. But I can't say I've ever been supremely bowled over by the food at any of the locations.

I think first and foremost for me it's the slaw. Hey, I love cole slaw, be it sweet or otherwise. But Primanti's slaw just seems to overpower everything else on their sandwiches, including the fries, which do their own thing trying to battle it out for top taste when mashed in with everything else you have going on between two slices of bread.

And, like another reviewer said, the Pittsburgher is just not very good at all due to the mushy, salisbury steak-like quality of the meat. There are a couple other local places around here that use the same kind of meat (Portofino's comes to mind with their hamburger hoagie), and I can't figure out why. Why go this route when you could just use good old ground beef or chuck, fry up a patty and cut it in half? It's bordering on meatloaf here, but meatloaf that's trying to taste like a burger and it's just weird.

Other sandwiches I've had here such as the jumbo and cheese fare better. Finding a sandwich that suits your tastebuds might take a few attempts to nailing down the right one. Although, there are plenty here who enjoy it right out of the gate and swear by it. Sometimes hype does indeed work.

The next time I visit, I plan on trying the chicken wings, which is a relatively new thing on the menu. I hear they're really good, and I'm a sucker for tasty wings. All in all, Primanti Brothers is a place you'll either love or wind up scratching your head at, wondering what all the fuss is about. I love Pittsburgh and its endless enjoyable food options. I just always feel like I should love Primanti's more since everyone else does."}

Famous for sandwiches stuffed with coleslaw, tomato and fresh-cut fries.

Good sandwiches, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"eh.

Go here once to say you did. You'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it. It will be pretty huge. That is all.

I might go back to check out the nightlife. I'll update my review then."}
{"text":"The review is for this location only. I love Primantis. Usually, I have great service at any of the restaurants, this one is the exception. 

A couple of times ago at this location, they did not have a host for 7-10 minutes to even get a reservation for a table.  Wait staff passed by multiple times, noone giving us a look.  Seeing a table near the bar open up after our wait, my family and I went and sat down, assuming things were not running like normal.  Someone comes over, cleared the table off, and walked away.  After 10 minutes of sitting there, a manager came over, told us we couldn't sit there, and told us to now wait again after at least 3 more families would have been ahead of us.  We were removed (a group of 6) for a group of 4. Now, I understand how restaurants work, but it was not the way to handle the situation as a manger, or any of the other employees.   

Also, the only place I have ever been that wouldn't serve a beer to someone who IS 21 because someone at the table is 20...  Not a good place for anyone who wants to hang out with friends under 21.  

I went to grab a beer or two, after already eating dinner, just to hang out with a couple of friends.  I was not served because I was old enough to have a beer, and they weren't... Apparently it is a thing, but nothing anyone will tell you when you turn 21.  The waitress tried to be helpful and recommended I sit at the bar (only steps from my table), and I could get my beers there.  But I went to be with friends, not sit around by myself. 

Moon Township Primantis has lost me as a customer, but that's OK, plenty of other locations to go to, and plenty of more food in the area."}
{"text":"Must be a Pittsburgh thing and like a lot of things here, they know it's not that good but they are just really proud of it. The sandwiches are big yes...which I guess is great if you favor gimmicks over taste. The cole-slaw is soggy and non-descript...the fries too were soggy and flavorless and I've had more flavorful corn-beef at an elementary school cafeteria St. Patty's day celebration. Hard pass if I were you."}
{"text":"This is the original location. And the best. It's not a tourist trap, and it existed for years before Food Network. It's been around forever. It has defined a style of sandwich. The meat is plentiful, as are the fries and coleslaw...which go on the sandwich. And don't worry, it's not a mayonnaise based coleslaw. It's awesome. And it's great drunk food. The original location is the only one I'll go to. And they're open 24 hours, even in the middle of a blizzard that has shut down the entire rest of the city. How do I know? Because I was right there at the counter with other real Pittsburghers as the city wept during Snowmageddon."}
{"text":"The best in the Burgh! Hands down! Great beer and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Road trip to Pittsburgh to watch the Penguins v. Stars game and wanted to try something new.  I decided on The Pitts-burger (#2 Best Seller) and my husband had the Cajun chicken, which he enjoyed and ate every bite but I was very disappointed in the burger part of mine.  The meat had no seasoning, tasted like it was broiled or steamed (like McDonalds meat, blah...) and really ruined the experience.  I wish I would have tried one of the deli meats instead but will probably never give it a second chance.  The slaw and fries were both good - fries seemed to be fresh cut so I'm not sure why they don't make the effort to put out a better burger patty."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh legend . This location is my third favorite behind ... Ft Lauderdale ( on the beach ) and the orginal in the strip ."}
{"text":"Pirmanti's is excellent if you acknowledge what it is going in. Cheap, plentiful food and cheap beer. If you expect anything more from it--good service or creative menu, you might find yourself being disappointed. 

There is something about eating a huge sandwich that can suffice for an entire meal (or two) that is kind of fun. Plus, no one looks elegant while eating one of these sandwiches. Consider them your own personal equalizer. Plus, their beer is pretty cheap and the salt and grease in the sandwiches can make you pretty thirsty. However, the service, at all of the locations I have visited, leaves a little something to be desired. Ranging from slightly bad to willfully rude. 

Downton location only takes cash, so beware! The Market Square location is great for people watching, but truly horrendous service. The more suburban locations pretty much feel like your average sports bar, so you're really only going for the sandwich at this point, not the experience. 

If you do go to Pittsburgh, it's totally a must. Just don't expect it to be anything it isn't."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.........but I respect those who do. French fries and cole slaw don't belong two thick pieces of bread with 8 pounds of meat. Count me out."}
{"text":"wow...Anyone that's grown up here knows about them and loves them... I know I get a cheese steak whenever I stop by.. Its kind of Pittsburgh's trade mark sandwich shoppe."}
{"text":"Fast food, delicious, and cool scenery in Market Square. Arrived around 9pm with my pal jimmy and ordered the spicy ham sandwich - sooooo good. Parking sucks, so had to park in a local garage for $5 an hour."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here today. I tried their famous French fry sandwich with Angus beef. I also ordered a local brewed beer. The service was friendly and the food came out pretty quick. The price is reasonable for the portion that you get. If you are in Pittsburgh you have to try this place at least once. It was recommended to me by two friends that a ate here before. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Simply a must while visiting Pittsburgh. This cultural icon is adorned head to toe with blue collar, steel city vibes and walls painted with Pittsburgh sports icons. The menu is simple and the service is quick but the sandwiches are massive and tasty. I loved it."}
{"text":"I love visiting Primanti Bros every time we come home. It is the homestyle comfort food that I miss when I'm back in NC. We stopped at this location on our way back from a night out to grab a true Pittsburgh style sandwich for dinner. 

We ordered waters for our drinks and had to send one back because there was stuff floating in it. Then, we went on to place our sandwich orders and my mom wanted the Angus steak. Our waitress went to log them in and came back to tell us that they were out of the Angus steak. My mom decided on a gyro instead and the waitress went to put that order in. She came back a minute later to tell us they were out of the gyro materials, too. Crazy. My mom wound up just getting a sandwich. (We've been to this location before and they've been out of menu items.)

The food service was quick once all of our orders were in and the sandwiches were actually put together really well. Sometimes, they're falling apart or the fries are everywhere. 

I do still love Primantis but will probably just stick with going to another location (like South Side or Station Square) since we've not had great experiences here."}
{"text":"Every time I am in the Burgh I have to get a Primantis. The suburban restaurants have a more laid back atmosphere and waitress service. Great food and decent beer. 5 stars for some of the best bar food in the US."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were seated at the bar, the hostess did not ask us if this was okay. I usually do not care but there is little to no leg room at the bar when sitting normally. The menu is on the wall with no prices listed, so I asked for a menu with prices. Our waitress said they do not have any. So I asked what are the prices, which she said are generally $8-$10 for a sandwich. We ordered 2 sandwiches (hamburger, steakburger), my girlfriend asked for no coleslaw on her sandwich, the waitress asked if she could put it on the side so she can try it, which my gf said yes. I asked to add onions to mine. The other waiter at the bar brought out our food... to the wrong people and then gave us the same sandwiches after those people told him it wasn't their order. My girlfriend's hamburger had coleslaw on the sandwich. My sandwich didn't have onions on it. I kindly asked the waiter for a side of onions and a fork. He stonchly reacted,\"You ordered onions!?\" In disbelief. I told him \"yes\". He walked to the kitchen and on the way told a coworker that I didn't order onions. (He didn't take my order, so he wouldn't know). He brought out a fork, but he said, \"Do you know why you didn't get onions!?... because we are out.\" Truth or not, service from him was very rude and poor. Anyways, about the wait time and food quality = not bad :) , nothing special (3 out of 5). The bread is definitely a downer, the bread is like it came out of a loaf of bread from the grocery store, they don't even toast or put the bread on the grill. Overall recommendation: If you're around town, sure try it, but don't go out of your way to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Update.  Went to a different location.  Non-smoking location.  Got pastrami this time instead of the bland sausage.  Added a fried egg to the sandwich as well.  I forgot how huge this thing was.  I could only eat half.  I am now a fan of Primanti's."}
{"text":"Having seen this place on TV, I was excited to go try this place. We went at an off time to avoid the crowds that we saw when we first arrived in Pittsburgh. The employees that were working at that time were extremely helpful and patient with all of us tourists in there at the time. I did not know that they were not famous for just one sandwich. They informed us that all of their sandwiches are made on fresh french bread and covered with provolone, fries, and vinegar based cole-slaw. We talked for a little while to the cook and he recommended the special, which was due to the Penguins winning the Stanley Cup. It was the HBK sandwich. Ham, Bacon, and Kielbasa sandwich. Everything was grilled on the flat top and smashed together in the sandwich. The portions are generous. The fries were nothing special and the slaw was crisp, but not super flavorful. The best part was the kielbasa and bread."}
{"text":"We come here all the time food is always amazing they are kid friendly which as a mom is the best part an the staff is always happy to be there an just really nice people"}
{"text":"I can only speak on behalf of the drinks, because there was no time to enjoy one of the famous sandwiches. The waitstaff was very friendly. The beer selection was great and i enjoyed a \"drunk duck\" drink. Such a fun place!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently. Trying to add another notch to my Food bucket list.

Im sure their isn't much to add but here are my tips:

This location open 24 hours 
Perfect \"Late Night\" spot
Bring cash
Get the sandwich the way it comes...don't be difficult
Share the sandwich unless you are mega hungry
Parking is iffy...but worth figuring out to go.

I will be craving this p[lace at 2:00 in the morning for sure!"}
{"text":"Bathroom was flooded with urine disgusting and unsanitary will never go back again. Service was great but the bathroom was so disgusting the AHD should inspect this place"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch before heading to the football game. It is always good with their large sandwiches. If you have never eaten at one of the locations, I find the best way to attack is to cut the sandwich in half. Once you pick it up you are committed until the half is gone."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled in here during a road trip to Maryland.  I'm so glad we did.  I had never heard of the place before and we went there because the breakfast place around the corner hadn't even taken our drink order after 20 min of being seated. It was morning and there really wasn't much open in the area.  We weren't sure we wanted lunch food that early, but we didn't really have a choice.  Boy, am I glad we did! It was fantastic! No hype, no frills just good-a** food! Fried egg on my sandwich? Yes please! We weren't even that hungry and both my friend and I devoured our sandwiches!  And out of respect to the sandwich and sandwich makers, didn't leave a bit behind! We didn't have to eat for the next 48 hours, however haha. Just coleslaw and fries on a sandwich, what's the big deal?  Sometimes the simple things really are the best.  Now I have a reason to go back to Pittsburg!"}
{"text":"A tourist vegetarian's view on primanti's: Grubbing! 

I had the egg & cheese sandwich with an iron city beer and enjoyed my entire experience (including the styrofoam cups, wax paper plates, and garbage behind my chair to throw it all away in).  The sandwich is big, messy to eat, full of different flavors, and even better with some red hot sauce.  Primanti's is open 24 hours, they have a TV with whatever game is on (yes I have noticed people in pittsburgh love their teams), and the food is fast, unpretentious, and satisfying (loads better than any other long hours-fast food-chain-type place).  I have to agree with what I was told...no trip to Pittsburgh is complete without a visit to Primanti's & some Iron City beer."}
{"text":"The experience is amazing! I can imagine how busy this place was in the days of the steel workers!"}
{"text":"Best thing about my meal here was they had bottled Augustiner, everything else was so far downhill i couldn't even keep my footing. 

There is one spot in chicago that does similar sandwiches with fries and cole slaw with the bread between the meat so I had a little experience before this visit.  I got two sandwiches the cheese steak and the corned beef.  both we very bad.  Bread was fresh, fries were hot but that is about it.  every bite all i tasted was fries with an after taste of sweet slaw.  the steak in the cheese steak  tasted like it was made in a microwave.  the meat had to have been bought at a local grocery store because it was as bland as bland gets.   

I guess it's my fault for getting the corned beef.  why would a place in the middle of freaking PA have a good corned beef sandwich.  they didn't, took one bite and threw it out.  beef was very dry and the overwhelming taste of the fries and slaw once again dominated the tasteless flavor. 

before both sandwiches found the garbage i pulled the meat out to taste separately in case i missed something, i didn't.  complete waste of time, money and what could have been a more flavorful experience at a nearby Jimmy Johns"}
{"text":"Sorry not a fan..Turkey Sandwich was boring tasting..fries were soggy and greasy, even my daughter who love fries didn't really care for them. My husbands pastrami was very good though, without the fries! Staff was very unfriendly."}
{"text":"This is a sandwich like no other.
I'm not saying this was the most delicious thing I have ever eaten, but it is like a piece of Pittsburgh history, you just have to try it once. Walking in, you feel the local flavor. There was a firetruck parked outside. This place is simple. You walk in and can order at the counter or sit down. The menu is listed on the wall, huge. 
Basics- Sandwich, Meat, Cheese, Coleslaw and Fries all between two pieces of bread.
I tried the Pastrami and my husband tried the Philly Steak. I think mine was better. He did too.
They bring you your meal on wax paper. No plates. Watch out, its a little greasy. There are no \"healthy\" options here just FYI. 
Great place to people watch too."}
{"text":"I tried the other knock-offs, but there's nothing like the original Primanti's!  Good to be home..."}
{"text":"Good pittsburgh classic but not as good as the ones downtown and in southside still great food I would go back"}
{"text":"Went here right before closing time and they were nice enough to take our food and drink orders. I got (and shared) the grilled chicken sandwich and clearly got the wrong thing, since this isn't one of the piled-high sandwiches. Oh well -- the piled high sandwiches look like a chore to eat without getting half of it on yourself.

We had really big glasses of Yuengling for $3.95 so that made it all worth it at 2 a.m. I didn't realize this place was so legendary or that it was a chain. You learn something new every day!"}
{"text":"I was in pittsburgh for a week and thinking like true pittsburghers we thought we'd come here for a late night snack and what a snack it was definately a tasty sandwich different from what i've had .  the place itself wasn't much it kind of looked like an old bar but that's ok anyway it was pretty cheap you should go I could go for a sandwich right now actually yum!"}
{"text":"I love this location!! Great atmosphere, and the service always seems to be fast. The food- ugh it's just so wonderful as I'm writing this I'm dreaming of their capicola and cheese sandwich (my favorite). I don't even like cole slaw or tomatoes, so even just the meat cheese and bread is enough to keep me coming back. 

That's WHY Primantis is always so good. They keep it rather simple, but their staple ingredients are so fresh and flavorful that they don't need much else to add. But, for the record, anyone I know who likes coleslaw LOVES theirs. But if you are like me and get it plain to spice it up, I will order a side of cheese to put on my sandwich- give it a try! Love this location and the food is always just as good! A classic favorite place of mine!"}
{"text":"Ok so my husband's from Pittsburgh and this place is legend. That said, our experience was mediocre. We walked in at 3pm, hoping to beat the lunch and dinner rush. We were seated by the bar, which was cool but weren't offered the option of a table and there were a few empty ones nearby and couldn't get a staff member to look at us until it was time to order. I ordered a steak and cheese and received a Pitts-burger. I asked the waitress if it was the steak and cheese and she nodded her head and walked off. That was the last interaction we had with any of the staff until we paid at the register. When she rang us up she listed off my sandwich, now calling it a Pitts-burger. Cool, thanks for ignoring us and dismissing my opportunity for you to correct your mistake. Checked the box for the original location, we will go to the spin-offs from now on."}
{"text":"Ok I think I fouled up on my order... I went with the spicy sausage and all I could taste was potatoes, which maybe if i didn't order chili fries I would have been more in to. After my chili fries with nacho cheese, which could have been tastier, maybe if they switched the cheese to a sharp cheddar and some pepperchinis would have helped. 

As far as the sandwich goes, I should have gone with something with more meat, rookie mistake, and maybe a side of chili instead of chili fries. My favorite part of my sandwich had to be the coleslaw, that was on point. I'm not sure if I should have put Ketchup on my sandwich or what the hell to do with the heap of potatoes in the sandwich? I really can't wait for a rematch with this place, because I think I need another shot to get my order right."}
{"text":"I got lured here by a friend today and honestly I didn't enjoy the food. Love the concept and the atmosphere is good but my sandwich was just ok.. I ordered the cheesesteak and cheese , which was the #2 bestseller  (alcohol is #1)  . First of all its ALOT of bread with ALOT of coleslaw and fries all INSIDE the sandwich with a little bit of the meat and cheese Just not my idea of a sandwhich personally. Eh."}
{"text":"The classic, unique Pittsburgh sandwich with fries and slaw built in. Great sandwiches and underrated fries. This location seems smaller than the one on the strip but in general, all the locations are bustling and crowded. Assert yourself in the line; the wait's never that long. I've shied away from the steak and usually go with pastrami, sweet sausage, or fish. Consistency among all the locations is nice. Even the one in the stadium is great!"}
{"text":"I recently eated at Primanti Brothers last time I visited Pittsburgh to see my family.

When i was young, my family used to drive into the city to have these great big sandwiches.

So when i went there, i was severly disappointed on how different the sandwiches are. Much smaller and a bit overpriced for what you get. 

Not that its horrible or anything, just not good value for money."}
{"text":"My extended family lives outside of Pittsburgh.  Before a visit in 2006, Chevy ran an ad in Sports Illustrated about the All Star Game in Pittsburgh.  The ad had a picture of the giant silly sandwich in front of the restaurant and of course, I had to try it.  So I brought the picture with me, had my cousin drive me around when I got off the plane and we found it!

I had the sandwich just like the picture.  We all really liked it.  Normally, I like food that's simple, you know, not trying to hard.  I've had tons of good pastrami and - like barbecue - if it's done well you don't need to dress it up much.  This sandwich, fully dressed, is a lot of fun though.  It was delicious and the restaurant's a real treat.  From an outsider's point of view, an outsider who loves local food, it's a great Pittsburgh icon."}
{"text":"We were told by many Pittsburghers that we needed to try Primanti Brothers and they were right! The sandwiches are served on super fresh, thick bread and are piled high with meat, cheese, cole slaw,, and fries. The fries are AWESOME on their own, too!  

This spot is a great deal, but come after 10 PM when all sandwiches are only $5! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I visited this Primantis when on a visit to Pittsburgh.

The parking lot was packed and I had to wait for someone to pull out before I could get a space. I was concerned there would be no seats insude, but I was still able to find a place at the bar. 

It's a very loud and fun type of place with a big crowd looking to have a good time. There are a lot of screens around, but the patrons seemed more focused on drinking, socializing and having a good time. 

The draft beer selection was fairly basic. I had a Yuengling draft. Service was a little slow at first, but after I ordered my food, it came real fast. 

Please be advised the sandwiches are huge.  I got the roast beef and cheese, which was really good and very filling. However, I don't really care for fries and cole slaw in the sandwich.  It was interesting to try this Pittsburgh specialty, but I wouldn't want to eat that type of and which on a regular basis. 

I'm giving this place four stars for the festive atmosphere, big portions, reasonable prices and value for the money, but I think the menu is a little too limited for me--mainly just sandwiches, pizza and appetizers, but no true dinner entrees."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple different locations of the Pittsburgh chain and found both similar in layout, ambience and experience. I have enjoyed meals at Primanti's. 

They have a good selection of beers and service at the bar is good. 

At this particular location I had a decent IPA and then a Belgian style beer. Both were good. I had the Pittsburgher, which they list as the #2 most popular item. This is a
burger on their signature bread with slaw and fries in the sandwich. I got double meat, so there were two big pieces of beef. The sandwich doesn't come with anything, but it is so filling you don't want anything with it. 

On an early Saturday evening I didn't have a problem finding a place at the bar here. It was a good experience and I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is a big deal in Pittsburgh so I figured I'd check it out. 

Eh. It was alright. The idea of fries and cole slaw on a sandwich ended up not being as exciting as I had hoped. 

I don't know if I'm just used to good ol' Southern hospitality but the waitress was not friendly. She seemed put out when my friend and I asked for menus (how dare people in a super touristy spot not know exactly what they want?!) and she never bothered to ask if we needed refills on drinks and we had to hunt her down to get our bill. 

This seems like something to experience once but I see no need to return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Consistent as always, although it seems the bread is different than I recall. 
Great nonetheless."}
{"text":"You can't beat their happy hour! Great sandwiches! A popular stop for the after-work crew."}
{"text":"This was one of the places recommended to me through a friend on my trip to Pittsburgh. I was surprised when it was directly next to where I was staying. The food is very good. I got a pastrami sandwich with double meat and egg. It was kind of spicy which I like. It was nice and hot and the French fries on the sandwich were nice too. 

The place is like and average restraint with a bar. A nice environment. The service was pretty average and the time to get our food was as well. I would recommend this for people to try. I enjoyed my time there and was stuffed by the time I left without spending too much money at all."}
{"text":"The original since 1933. Only one of the stores to not change the menu at all. Old school classic in every regard. Food, atmosphere, service, and prices. A great place to grab a bite with anyone for a casual, fun, no BS experience. Filled with Pittsburgh natives of all ages and backgrounds. I highly recommend. It's an experience. I'm The food is excellent."}
{"text":"OMG...!  What is on this Captain sandwich???  It tastes AMAZING...!!!  I ordered it w extra slaw but holy hell- it is DELICIOUS...!  You guys need to try this sandwich...!"}
{"text":"Their menu says it all... their #1 Best Seller is beer.  Why would you try to rate this place on their food?  I know they want to attract families and out of towners and folks looking for a real 'Pittsburgh experience' but I come for the beer and they have never let me down.  

And don't get me started on their Happy Hour!  Half off ALL beers & mixed drinks?  Are you Serious?  Yes I am!  After an hour or so with HH beer prices, trust me, your sandwich will taste like all you've ever wanted it to be.  :D"}

{"text":"If you live in Pittsburgh, and don't know about Primanti's....then I don't know what to tell you.

If you're visiting Pittsburgh, it's a rite of passage of sorts to try one of these classic sandwiches. I always bring visitors here and they're usually satisfied. Meat+fries+coleslaw+Italian bread. It's not fancy food, it's not healthy food, but it's yummy food. 

My favorites are the kielbasa and capicola. Also can't go wrong with the classic steak. 

Pro tip: Hot sauce.

Confession: I don't like coleslaw, so I always order it without. I always get a hard time about it from staff, but they always do it anyways.

Locations other than this one in Market Square include the Strip, Oakland, South Side, any stadium, and a smattering throughout the suburbs."}
{"text":"Place is great. Kind of small though. Food is great but the bread to meat ratio is janked."}
{"text":"I really don't know what the fuss about Primanti brothers is all about - other than their portions being big, the food was mostly tasteless.  To be fair, let me just say that my apple allergy prohibited me from partaking in their coleslaw and this could lead to my impression that they aren't all that special.  If you don't already know, Primanti Bros is known for serving up HUMONGOUS sandwiches piled high with meat, French fries and coleslaw.  

I ordered their fish filet sandwich and it was just bad.  The fried fish filet was incredibly dry, the French fries were soggy and had been sitting out for a while and the vast amounts of tartar sauce I tried to dump on each bite did not do anything to help the taste.  

One thing you should DEF order if you come to the Primanti Bros shop is their chili cheese fries.  They are SO incredibly good.  The cheese is thick and they are very generous with the portions and chili - cheese - fries ratio.  This helped me to enjoy my meal more.

Primanti Bros - though famous - is not the type of place you would say ... take a date.  They're not fancy and this is the type of place where you are always welcome to dress down and you cannot be scared to use your hands and just dig into a sandwich.  Plates are not provided (sandwiches comes on the wax paper that is used to wrap sandwiches), but napkins are plentiful.  

I am glad to say that I experienced the famous Primanti Bros for myself, but I would not be overly enthusiastic about a return."}
{"text":"I always eat here anytime I get a chance.  It is always really really good.  Any sandwich you get is good.  They go well with a beer too.  If you didnt know the sando comes w fries and slaw on it!"}
{"text":"Let's face it.  Those of us not from Pittsburgh come here because we saw it on TV.  It's the novelty of it--doesn't really matter if the food is good or not.  For those who are interested, I'll give you my impression of the sandwich.

The sandwiches are okay.  It's the experience of eating a sandwich that has fries and slaw on it that's cool.  If you were to remove the fries (like most people are forced to do given it's size), you have a sandwich that's pretty average.  I had the pastrami and cheese.  Not a whole lot of meat means the flavor of even this spicier selection was overwhelmed by the taste of potatoes.  The slaw adds a nice crunchy bite.  The bread is totally forgettable.  It adds no flavor or texture of its own and is there merely to hold the contents together.

This location is not great for lunch.  It shares space with a much larger cigar bar that relegates the lunch area to a cramped space in the rear.  Go downtown to the one on Market Sq or the original in the Strip District to get the full experience."}
{"text":"So this is my second trip to Pittsburgh and, therefore, Primanti Bros. You have to try it at least once! Is it the best sandwich ever? No. But it's the novelty of it as well as the blue collar appeal that keeps me coming back. The meats are pretty tasteless as is the bread and cheese. Really all you have here is a wad of protein and carbs that tastes like potatoes with a hint of vinegar from the slaw. To give it a negative review, tho, is to misunderstand its original purpose: to provide a filling lunch all in one convenient package. This isn't a gourmet experience and to review it as such would be pretentious. I enjoy it from the perspective of a  1930s delivery driver looking for a hearty lunch that won't break the bank. To him, this would be a winner!"}
{"text":"Decent food and great service. I am from out of town and the bartenders were the most beautiful women I saw in Pittsburgh. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet. Primanti Brother's - an institution in Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania. I was in town for just a few days working on a campaign event and we decided immediately after our event finished we needed to celebrate with beer, shots, and some ridiculous sandwiches. And when I mean ridiculous, I mean tradition diner style, huge white bread, large grease meat topped with coleslaw and FRENCH FRIES. Yes, each sandwich is finished with fries. The place is classic and charming and goofy and a heart attack just smelling the fumes - but it's fun and unique and the food is quite good if you can avoid thinking about the health affects. The photos should do all the talking needed. At least I can check the box."}
{"text":"i've always been and always will be a big fan and follower of lineage, tradition, and history.  primanti is living tradition and history.  no matter what, when in the burgh, you gotta have a primanti sandwich.

every town makes there own sandwich differently, their own hotdog differently, their own hamburger differently, their own barbeque, and their own pizza differently.  primanti is known for its pile of meat, stacked with coleslaw and fries on top, sandwiched between two pieces of italian bread.

these sandwiches are HUGE.  honestly i can't eat more than half of one because they are so filling.  this is a great place to satisfy your munchies.  

its a great place to come after you've finished your shopping in the strip."}
{"text":"I'm sucker any time chili cheese fries are listed on the menu at a mom n' pop type joint.  Just thinking about it now is making me drool.... I keep searching for that perfect place, the one exactly like Red Hot Lovers in Ann Arbor but preferable would be mobile enough to follow me wherever I go so that when I get a craving I can just pop in.

The fries were good.  The chili was good but they were a bit stingy.  The thing that ruined it for me was that they used the fake velveeta cheese, the kind that never solidifies.  Oh Red Hot Lovers!  I miss you!

As for their sandwiches, I liked the fries and coleslaw combination.  Hot salty fries with cool vinegary coleslaw.  Yum.  However, given the ratio of fries (huge) compared to coleslaw and sandwich filling (pastrami & cheese w/ egg), sometimes it just tasted like a bland french fry sandwich.  When the combination in my bite was just right, it was fabulous, but they could work a little more on the ratios so it's not quite so potatoey.  Prob wouldn't be such a big deal if the potatoes weren't a little bland (yes, there are tasty potatoes but not in the 20 lb costco bags).  Def the hot sauce at the table helped a lot with the potatoes.

It's also a very messy sandwich.  Prob due to the cheap white bread.

But on the other hand it's also very large and you can share a sandwich and get a humongous dill pickle."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches on the planet! A Pittsburgh tradition that you have to try! There are a lot of quality options."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to come all the way to Pittsburgh and *not* eat a Primanti's sandwich at the original location.  It's quintessentially \"Pittsburgh\" and apparently one of those things you love or you hate, you revere or revile.

Husband and I made three attempts to eat here.  The first two times, the line was out the door and down the block.  There's not a whole lot of food I'll stand on a long line for, and I definitely wasn't interested in squandering precious vacation time waiting to order a sandwich.  So we came back at 11 on a Sunday -- since this location is open 24 hours -- walked right in to an empty dining room, sat at the bar behind the flat top, and were eating within 10 minutes.

So?

I fall right in the middle of love/hate, revere/revile.  Most places give you fries and slaw on the side of your sandwich.  Primanti's puts them both *between* the bread, along with tomato and cheese.  This makes for a messy -- albeit convenient -- meal.  Husband and I split a tuna salad and the \"Colossal Fish,\" with a huge, deep-fried fish filet.  The sandwiches are incredibly filling, and they were good, but my mind wasn't blown.  It's deli meats and cheeses on bread they don't bake in-house.  Frankly, I think husband and I liked the mayo-less, sweet and sour slaw the best out of everything, even ordering an extra side of it to smother our sammies with.

I'm glad to have had the Primanti's experience.  But I couldn't eat one of those bad boys very often without a cardiologist on speed dial.

{"text":"No frills place. You want a sandwich, you get a sandwich. You want a pop? You get a pop. DONE. Eat your sandwich and move on.

And the sandwich is DELICIOUS! Never had anything like it before. With the fries and cole slaw mix made it amazing. 

I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner because my dad had heard great things about the sandwiches.  While my folks both had sandwiches, and thought they were pretty decent, I had the chili and the fries.  The fries were solid, and almost worth the trip.  The chili, on the other hand, was pretty institutional, and not that great.

The staff was probably the best part of the visit: they were nice and extremely accommodating.  I'd give them another try based on their servers and bartenders.  

Overall, give them a shot.  Pimanti Bros. has an interesting history, and is worth experiencing at least once."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the san which that i ordered, it just was not good at all. I ordered their pitt sandwich and i was disappointed. The patty used was dry and almost meatloaf in tasted and flavor. I kept using different sauces they had to make it taste better but i just could not finish the sandwich. I appreciate the service and the huge selection of beers though."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich. I don't get what all the fuss is about. Must be a Pittsburgh thing."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight based on the Yelp recommendations (keep them coming as they help make it easier on where to eat), we were very impressed.

Service was great, menu choices multiple options, super value for money and finally the meals themselves were plentiful and very tasty.

Try the Reuben Sandwich on Marble rye well worth it."}
{"text":"Many Pittsburgh locals suggested I give this place a shot when I took a business trip here. If this place is considered good to the locals, then I feel sorry for the people of Pittsburgh.

I ordered the Pittsburgher cheese steak and the Kolbassi & cheese. For both sandwiches, the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale.  The bread would crumble with each attempted bite, eventually leading to me abandoning them.  The fries were so dry and stale tasting as well that I thought it better to just throw them out. The veggies were about average, not fresh, but didn't taste gross.  All that was left were the cheese and the meats. They may have been the most disappointing because I thought that I could maybe at least enjoy that. Essentially, the entire sandwich was inedible and I settled for Five Guys instead."}
{"text":"I dont really get the whole Pittsburgh thing....you know putting everything on your sandwich (or salad)....so I normally would not eat much here. I have, however found a love for pierogies and cheese stuffed pretzels. Which they do quite well at Primantis. 
They have a good wide open bar here. I bet it is good for watching sporting events and such."}
{"text":"I'd been to Primanti Brothers a few years ago while in Pittsburgh for work, and I was disappointed. I will say though, that the first time, I had takeout. 

This time, the hubby and I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon before driving back to Chicago. I had the corned beef and the hubby had the pastrami. 
This is one seriously delicious sandwich. I LOVE the slaw and fries packed right in, and the two meats we chose were perfect. 
I could only finish half of my sandwich, so be warned - it's huge!"}
{"text":"Really great sandwich! It was huge. I got the roast beef. Bread was so soft, coleslaw had just the right amount of tanginess to it, fries were nicely seasoned and the meat was delicious. I have wanted to try this place since seeing it on the travel channel. Other locations have different sandwiches and pizza, but we wanted to go to the original location. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, bring your appetite. If you've never heard of this place, you should definitely try it. No trip to Pittsburgh is complete without a stop at Primanti Bros. There's not much else I can say that hasn't been said in 100 other reviews."}
{"text":"This place is over rated.  I was driving from LA to Philly and decided to go a half hour out of my way to try this sandwich with french fries I have come to hear about over the years.  The sandwich was good but nothing I will tell friends about or ever attempt to go out of my way to get again.  Cash only, about $7 a sandwich.  The service reminds me of cheesesteak places in philly where the people are too bad ass inner city to smile."}
{"text":"I tried this back in December of 2010 and HATED this Pittsburgh staple.  In retrospect, I blame MYSELF.  See, I was born and raised just outside of Philly so I decided to order the Philly Cheesesteak Primanti Sandwich.  I'm used to flank steak, chopped and sauteed, slathered wit' wiz not a pressed flavorless brick of mystery meat and a slice of provolone.

My fault right?

I was back in Pittsburgh this December and gave these guys another chance.  This time I ordered the Roast Beef Primanti Sandwich, hot juicy shaved roast beef, provolone, fries and their signature slaw.  Delicious!  The service was fast, my food piping hot and football was on.  All was right with the world."}

{"text":"I'm not a big deli sandwich but I got the joe, dick and Stanley (or something like that) which was awesome. I split that with the pittsburger (I didn't like the coleslaw burger combination). The coleslaw has a good amount of pepper in it. The chili cheese fries were really good as well. Hopefully, I'll live thru this meal and make it back to eat here again"}
{"text":"Bad experience here.  I got the turkey and cheese and thought it was just okay.  My boyfriend got the \"Top Sirloin\" and it was not at all a \"top\" anything.  It looked like dog food. Terrible.  Aside from that, the fries were just meh.  The icing on the cake was our terrible server. He didn't crack a smile the entire time. He messed up my boyfriends order then acted like we were being annoying by pointing it out.  We asked later for a refill and he just looked at us and said \"okay.\"  He acted like we were inconveniencing him the whole time we were there. VERY UNPLEASANT!"}
{"text":"This is a tourist trap. It may be on websites and it may be on travel apps, but be careful of this place...it's not as good as it sounds like. The fries are good, but McDonald's is across the street. What they do here is stuff fries into your subway sandwich you order and call it special. Their #2 most popular sandwich is #2 because they claim that beer is their #1 best seller. Of course this makes sense because this would be great food after a night of drinking. A great food for a hangover."}
{"text":"For starters, this is a must stop if you're in the Pittsburgh area. This was my first experience here and it sure made a lasting impression. This sandwich is  more like a meal and will leave you with a full belly and satisfied appetite. I ordered the New Yorker and split it. These sandwiches are just stacked. The wings are also fairly tasty with a side of blue cheese. The drink selection is vast and they always have daily specials. Definitely make this a go to pit stop next time you're in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"They would have gotten 5 stars because the sandwiches we had were AWESOME! But the female server in the red shirt really had a bad attitude and gave me crappy service.  I had the angus steak sandwich and my son the pastrami one, both were really good man food that I washed down with a cold rolling rock.  Atmosphere is perfect for the food they serve.  Will definitely comeback next time I'm in Pitt, I'll just make sure I avoid that server. ;-)))"}
{"text":"first time to pittsburgh we had to make the obligatory trek to primanti's and why not to the original location. i had the #2 best seller which altho it says cheesesteak it is more like a hamburger. no matter what meat you get the toppings are the same: their vinegar based cole slaw and french fries on soft italian bread. it was good. my mind wasn't completely blown but it was good. french fries with cheese sauce were good. dh had an agnus version of the sandwich and he really liked it.

waitress was incredibly nice and the atmosphere is just classic. strip district location was really fun too!"}
{"text":"I visited Primanti Bros. for the first time during a girls' weekend in Pittsburgh. We were visiting a friend who lives there and wanted the 'full Pittsburgh' experience, and a meal here was a must (in my book). I loved everything about the place: the location on Market Square has indoor and outdoor seating, including seating at the counter (which I highly recommend...), the food is great and and the overall atmosphere, though a little touristy, was really fun.

The day we went it was raining lightly, but the place was packed. The outdoor seating, and a portion of the line, are under cover, which was nice, but if the line was really long, and weather worse, you might be standing out in it. The guy at the door did his best to find us seating but we were a group of 8 and had to be split. Half were going to sit inside and half out, but then seating at the counter came up, so half sat at a table and half at the counter, but we were all close enough to see each other.

The counter service was fantastic. Being right in front of the grill guys not only lets you see their process, but lets you get their attention if you need something - like a beverage, a refill on your beverage, or if you just want to order or pay. The other half of our group who sat at a table felt their table service was slower, and because it was crowded and the waitress had to wind through the crowds, there was time in between their sitting and getting menus, then from getting menus to ordering...they actually ordered before those of us at the counter but got served after...and to pay took forever and we ended up taking it up to the register ourselves. Even with what seemed like slowness, all 8 of us were in and out of there in less than an hour.

In terms of the food, this place is really not for those with dietary restrictions...though they do have salads and other items on the menu that are not meat and/or don't have dairy. I split a sandwich with one of my friends - we had the angus beef with fries and slaw on the bread. I thought the sandwich was tasty and that a half was plenty for me. Portions really are large and because the fries come INSIDE the sandwich there's no reason to have to order a side. However, others in our group felt that the chicken was bland and the burger was also flavorless - so maybe it is better to stick with the more flavorful meats like ham, pastrami, or something marinated or fried. Our one friend who had the fish sandwich thought it was awesome.

I would go back again, and I would recommend, especially for the experience. Immediately after posting my pics on FB, friends were messaging me begging me to bring back sandwiches for them (all the way from Pittsburgh to Rochester, NY), so that alone should tell you something! Last comment - for a foodie city like the 'Burgh, sandwiches here are a great value! Just be prepared to wait in the line and wait a little for your food."}
{"text":"I have never heard of this place before but my coworkers wanted to eat here since they were told by their friends that it was good. 

Now I know I should've ordered the sandwich with fries in it since it was what this place was known for; however, I was feeling sick from the turbulence from my two flights earlier. I went with the Chicken Club Sandwich ($7.49) and a soda ($2.19). The Chicken Club Sandwich came with fries and I would only assume it would taste similar to the sandwich with fries in it. 

The Chicken Club Sandwich was good and it came with a lot of fries. I tried a few and they were good. I would recommend it if you don't know what to get.  The staff were all nice to us and it felt like a welcoming place to eat."}
{"text":"Had the Corn Beef Sandwich and Broccoli Soup.  The sandwich was excellent; soup was cold.  Service was very good.  Music volume was a bit loud, but I'm a geezer.  I'll go back."}

{"text":"After the initial novelty of fries and coleslaw on a sandwich, Primanti Bros is quite ordinary. However, there is no denying the sandwich is tasty and enjoyable.

There are few foods that encapsulates a city and are easily identifiable as a Primanti Bros sandwiches. Its as synonymous with Pittsburgh as the Steelers, the steel industry, and the Three Rivers. When ever I am in town I always swing by to grab one. I love it!

This sandwich's main attraction is its amalgamation of meat, cheese, coleslaw and fries. It was Epic Meal Time before EMT got big on the internets. That being said, its quite plain and, in all honesty, boring. The meats and cheeses are your standard deli meats. The slaw is pretty dull with no acid, color, or salt. The fries are, well, fries. The bread is super soft and thick, but that softness yields to the juices that can create a sloppy mess toward the end of the sandwich. Now, just when you think I'm hating on this beast, I do have to say that it tastes better than the individual components in an act of culinary synergy. This is definitely one of the places that I seek out after a late night when ever I'm in the 'Burgh.

The other things I don't like is that this place is cash only. I get it, but its very inconvenient. I wish I owned a restaurant that had the gravitas to be cash only, so I'm a bit jealous! The other thing is that the service is inconsistent. Some of the servers are very energetic and entertaining and very welcoming. In fact, on a recent trip, he forgot our beer when we ordered it. After reminding him we ordered beers, he gave it to us on the house. Now THAT is service! The most recent time, I walked in after my train got in to the Amtrak station at 5:30 am. It seemed that the people working there were confused that someone was in so early. It took a long time to order and an inordinate amount of time to get my food despite being one of three people in the place. Oh well, life goes on.

Anyway, this place is an institution. A trip to Pittsburgh isn't complete without stepping into the hallowed ground of Primanti's and scarfing down a piece of Americana!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Why is this place famous? Because they put gross, soggy fries on their bland tasting subs? The food here just doesn't even come close to matching the hype.

Even when I was drunk as hell, I found that a hot, fresh sausage sandwich right off the grill from one of the street vendors was much more satisfying than one of Primanti Bros' greasy, flavorless subs.

If you want to eat at a famous Pittsburgh institution, go get a hot dog and fries at The Original. Granted, you might get shot, but, hey, it's worth the risk."}
{"text":"The pitts-burger was ahhhhmaazing! They serve it up right out of the grill on sheet paper onto your table! 
I'm glad I visited this original spot during my short stay. 

Staff is also prompt in getting you your order. And the place is kept clean and well-decorated."}
{"text":"Very unique menu.  Loved the coleslaw, never had a sandwich with fries on it before.  Fried pickles were yummy!  Decent service too."}
{"text":"I mean, yah, it is an institution of wonderful Pittsburgh fast food.  We all know and get that.  The wonderfully fresh bread, the sweet and lovely coleslaw, the meat piled high and ofcourse the signature fries to top of the sandwhich.  All of it made fresh right in front of your eyes.  Typically, I used to go to this location and I wouldn't be able to eat for the rest of the day.  The last time I went though I wasn't bloated to tell the truth.  I am not sure if they are making the sandwhiches smaller, or what.  Also, it did seem a little more pricey than I remember.  I still liked the sandwich, but things did seem a little different.  Anyone else notice that about this location?"}
{"text":"What a great happy hour, whole house!!! Bartenders are fun and good!! Food is spot on~"}
{"text":"The service at this location is great. We've done both pick-up and eat-in service with great experiences. We've had delicious pizzas, sandwiches, and appetizers and everything has been very good. My favorite classic sandwich is the salami. When the new app came out and I had credit for a sandwich so I decided to try the #2 seller, the Pittsburgher. Big mistake! I thought the patty on the sandwich was awful. It was spongey and tasted like a frozen, processed patty. So far, that's been the only thing I haven't liked. The app works great and my take out order went through with no hiccups!"}
{"text":"Bread, slaw, tomato, fries, and a small piece of overcooked fish all piled together. Warm yiengling and mediocre service.   Aweful"}
{"text":"I am a Pittsburgh native who comes to Primanti's *maybe* once a year when I'm doing my holiday shopping in the Strip. It's always about 90% tourists when I'm in there, and I'm unsurprised to see that the reviews are also mainly touristy types. I think many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a Primanti's sandwich actually *is.* Their cheesesteak is not at all like a Philly cheesesteak (God forbid!) and the meat in general is weirdly ersatz, with some selections usually not seen in a modern restaurant setting (knockwurst? whatever the burger patty on the cheesesteak is made from?) Primanti's originated as working-class trucker's food, designed to be held in one hand while driving (hence the purpose of having the fries INSIDE the sandwich and the 'round-the-clock hours). So yeah, there's something a little gimmicky and passé about it now, particularly when they have a location in Florida and everyone and their mumma is making a \"Pittsburgh style!\" sandwich. But it does have its origins in the Rust Belt, slap-it-together-and-make-it-work culture that makes Pittsburgh unique. IMO it's worth it just to stop in and experience, if only for the 15 minutes it takes for them to make your sandwich and you to eat it, some truly vintage P-burgh culture.

So how is that mystery meat on the sandwich, in this townie's opinion? Well...it's pretty good. I actually like those weird burger patties and sometimes crave them when I'm not at home. The sweet sausage and kielbasa sandwiches are also pretty excellent. Don't drink an Iron City (it's disgusting for real) and have a Yuengling instead. Have a boilermaker if you're feeling especially touristy and ready to get drunk. Then stumble out into the Strip and enjoy your uniquely Pittsburgh experience."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good food.  Very Pittsburgh-esque"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros sandwiches are just A-OK. The history behind these sandwiches are what makes it worth checking out. It's one of those things you just have to do once if you visit Pittsburgh. 

We ordered two capicola & cheese sandwiches to go (we were told that was the best one). I asked for the slaw on the side but they gave me the slaw in the sandwich and the fries on the side- wah wah. Overall, it was average. I only ate half a sandwich at lunch but it felt so heavy and I was full for the rest of the day. Def not worth the calories- so I'd recommend sharing."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh institution since '33!  The food is good, prices cheap, service friendly and fast, and it's clean!

Don't listen to haters that say the staff is rude, because even when I've seen clueless 'soccer moms' ask for a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomato, the staff has been accommodating.....even to go as far as putting the fries that would be on the sandwich, on the side.

Stand outs are the deluxe double Egg and cheese, Pastrami and cheese (try this with an Egg!), and the Kielbasa and cheese.

Lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first because I hate cole slaw. But, I was told this is a must in Pittsburghian culture and so I braved it. YUM! These are some great sandwiches. I should have known to trust anyone who puts fries in between bread. Easy to eat meal for sure. The sandwiches are huge, so you could split it with a friend, if you have the same taste buds. Now, if only they had one of these in Chicago.

I'll be back if I'm ever in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Pretty much a Pittsburgh tradition as best I can tell. Everyone seems to have heard of this place. I can understand why. It isn't all that often that you get a sandwich with french fries (and coleslaw if you like that sort of thing) on it.

Food was all good enough, I suppose. Had the hot sausage sandwich without the slaw. They have all sorts of sandwich choices. Cheap prices! There were 6 of us and our bill was about $45! I just thought it was a little flat. I think crispier fries would have helped. And it could just use more flavor.

The building is smallish but has lots of character. And you can watch them make the food right there so there is no mystery involved. How do you keep fries and slaw on a sandwich when they are piled on? Smash it all together of course! Everything is done simply. No plates or silverware needed. That makes it sound like it would be messy but it somehow isn't.

We had to wait 15-20 minutes on a Friday afternoon. Sounds like they take reservations so you might consider that. Though if you have fewer people, you would get a seat faster.

If you are visiting Pitt, I'm pretty sure a trip to Primanti Bros. is basically a requirement, but don't expect anything out of this world good.  Tradition seems to be it's biggest draw."}
{"text":"Second time here, and not disappointed.  (See my first review below).  It pretty much sums up my sentiments.  (Except it was roast beef this time.) Here on a rainy October day, drinking beer and eating a massive sandwich.  What else would one do when it rains in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst sandwich I have ever taken a bite of.   I'm not even sure it was beef. The beef patty on steak sandwich looked like a veggie burger.   It was greasy and completely uneatable.   Everything is served on wax paper and in paper cups.  My new rule,  if you can spare a plate in a sit down restaurant, I should not be eating there.   Shame on you Andrew Zimmerman,  sometime you should just say, your food sucks!   He did score on the Vietnam street food next to the seafood store.  Grabbed it after leaving that gross sandwich!!  It was incredible!"}
{"text":"I can't for the life of me figure out why all the hype. I was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat. But I'm a tourist here, and wanted to try it.

It was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries.  

The thick white bread was dry and boring; too crusty. 

The fries on the sandwich overpowered the taste! So I dismantled it. When the rude server asked how I liked it, I was honest. He gave me big time attitude and commented that I took it apart. I told him, I took it apart because it was a horrible sandwich (the pastrami, by the way). And that, sir, is why you got a $0.35 tip! (never give a zero tip, they'll think you forgot, always leave just a small amount of change)

If you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable, why bother?  (The server, as he walked away, told me it's really good with hot sauce, which was just Tabasco, which I don't like, any way!)

They left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich!

Of the 4 staff members I came in contact with, all but 1 were rude, unfriendly and uncaring. One constantly walked by trash that had blown off outdoor tables without picking it up.

The fries were good. 

Nope, won't be back."}
{"text":"During a convention in Pittsburgh we had to try Primanti.  It was great.  Whoa, tiger, back it down, I had better explain a bit more.  The food was good, let's not get too crazy here.  You pick a meat, a decent quality meat, not great, they warm it on the grill, Slap it on some really good french bread, add a fist of coleslaw throw some fresh fries on top and call it a sammy.  

So the quality of ingredients is good, meat was good, bread great, fried and slaw good.  But the coolness factor adds a star and the price can't be beat.  We both got large sandwiches for about 8 bucks.  I'm definitely a fan, and will go back if I'm in town.  I wish there was a four and a half stars, that's what I would give, but, without that option, I have to round down, because to get a five from me is tough.  Nothing wrong with a four stars, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this location.  We got there late, and the server was awesome, great guy.  The atmosphere was great, and it's just so gosh darn cool.

Go!"}
{"text":"Over rated and well over self important feel at this place. It's not NY relax, don't take yourself that serious. A touch stuffy for a sandwich joint???"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding, and the beer is damn cheap. This is a must visit if you're in Pitt. 

Sidenote: While there, I saw Bruce Vilanch slamming down a sandwich. If that fat bastard eats at Primanti's, you know they are serving the best sandwiches around. His poor assistants (I think they were his assistants, or I hope so, for their sake) probably had to wipe the messiness of his face. They had their heads down following in Bruce's large sweaty shadow walking out of the place, most likely ashamed of what they just witnessed. You can't unsee certain things."}
{"text":"It is totally worth going here to get the tradition out of the way. Bread is really good, as are the pickles. The quality of meat is just so-so and it is a little hard to follow the service model when you are a newbie. They will sit you down- the menu is on the wall. The sandwiches all come with meat, fries, tomatoes and coleslaw on the sandwich. You have to order pickles on the side for extra. Order, eat, leave. You will be stupid and eat the whole sandwich. Accept it. You pay at the big signs that say \"PAY HERE.\" Cash only."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, waited about 8-10 minutes to just get waters and waited almost an hour for our sandwiches. When we questioned the waitress about our food. She stated we had only been there a half an hour?!?!! 
I will not return to this location, service was poor."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Primanti Bros while with family while visiting Pittsburgh. It was great! I love that Pennsylvanians put fries on everything! That's an awesome idea. It only improves salads and sandwiches.

I had the Pitts-burger and Cheese sandwich, which is listed as the \"#2 Best Seller\" on their menu. It was served on fresh Italian bread and piled high with french fries, coleslaw, and tomato. It was really good. If I make my way back to Primanti Bros I definitely want to try some other menu items though. 

I didn't order a side, since the sandwich was served with fries, but if I eat here again I'll definitely check out their tots. 

I think this is an awesome spot for lunch for sure! If you're in the area you should check it out."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and a great experience in itself. Along with the young gent, that seemed as if he was a bus boy/host with glasses and a hat on, greeted us very politely and seated us in a very timely manner. As well as, we saw him working very hard around the establishment. But on the other hand, our server, who we later found out goes by Nate, after we had to ask his name- was not very welcoming. Took quite a while to come over to greet us and just asked us what we wanted to drink. We ordered a few beers and waters, while we got our beers right away it took about 15 minutes to get the waters. He also stopped mid-sentence he used the term \"hold on\" to go to another table. Nate needs to work on his serving skills. I say all of this after working in a restaurant for many years. But, the food was fantastic! And I'm sure other servers are very good at what they do. Just don't have Nate as your server."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with a group of friends on our way to Cedar Point in Ohio.

My boyfriend and I ordered a sandwich, loaded tots & wings to share. We got the corned beef and cheese sandwich with aa fried egg, which was just okay for me. They cut the sandwich in half for us, but I only got about 1/4 of the meat. The coleslaw tasted a little weird at windiest and the fries make the sandwich a bit starchy. The meet, cheese, and bread were good though. I'd probably order the coleslaw and fries on the side next time. We ordered the ranch BLT tots, which were good but it's literally drowned in ranch. Good thing we both like ranch. They give you forks to eat it with because you wouldn't be able to eat it otherwise. I didn't eat the wings, but my boyfriend said the hot ranch flavor was pretty good. 

The service was good at this location. I know they have quite a few locations but this one was right off the highway we were on which was convenient. I was feeling a little off when we visited so I would definitely give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"Bland food, rude servers, and I was overcharged on my debit card. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"With all the hype I'd heard about this place, naturally I was curious to go to one at least once while in Pittsburgh. And from what I saw on their website, the closest one I could find was near Indianapolis. So decided to give it a try, on the first day of a 2 day trip I did to Pittsburgh last month.

Got the Capicola(spicy Italian ham) and Cheese sandwich to go(as I was staying at a nearby Holiday Inn Express), and to me there was something about the cole slaw and vinaigrette in the sandwich that unfortunately I didn't care about. I think it was more the vinaigrette that overwhelmed the sandwich, and made me not care for it. And thought there'd be a little more interesting taste to it, overall. It seems to be all white bread only on their sandwiches, and I wish you could get other types of bread as well such as wheat bread.

Glad I did try a sandwich at least once from Primanti Bros., but am not sure this place is for me. I'll give them this, that their drink specials at least looked nice from what I saw. I just wish I liked their sandwiches more, but ah well. Maybe one day I'll give them another shot, but I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Always a Pittsburgh staple when I make it back. Southside is a good alternative to the Strip District. I spent a lot of the late 80's and 90's elbowing to get a sandwich late night there. So a little crowd on the Southside is nothing. Pastrami was a little tough today. But the taste was on point. Staff were on it. My staple is cap egg n cheese. I'll be back before I head back west."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros is the dirty guilty pleasure that I give into once a year.

Most times, when out of towners ask for a local spot to eat, I'm one of the few that actually pushes them AWAY from this defacto Burgh tradition.  Don't get me wrong, Primanti's isn't bad, but it isn't exactly great either.  Typically I end up smothering mine in hot sauce and salt/pepper to get some flavor onto otherwise bland sandwiches.

With that said, every once in awhile, I get this odd, insatiable craving for a cap and egg sandwich (w/ onion)... and when I do cave to that temptation, it's oddly satisfying.

On the experience front, Primanti's is definitely one of a kind.  I don't know of anywhere else you can get burly bartenders to slam down a mess of a sandwich in wax paper on your table (something the suburban restaurants fail to provide).  If you're going to go, I highly suggest going either to the original in the Strip, or, if you don't feel like waiting in line during the busy times, the Market Square location."}
{"text":"Terrible. It's a bunch of flavorless vegetables, with a dog food grade \"beef\" patty that has no seasoning and cooked to burnt perfection, topped with terrible fries. Only bearable with ketchup. The chili was better than the \"pitts burger\", and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"A really popular burger restaurant in Pittsburgh and there was a long line outside even at noon. We had the Pittsburgh & cheese burger and pastrami's & cheese burger, with former being the 2nd popular. Fun fact: beer is the 1st popular! LOL 
The burgers were extremely huge, with beef, chips and tomatoes in them. Really yummy!"}
{"text":"What else can you say about a Primanti's sandwich?? Capicola or egg and cheese is my go to sandwich. What is really great here is the pizza. Hand tossed, great toppings. Love the white pizza with anchovies. Also a great deal on Tuesday nights. Pizza, salad, pitcher of beer for under $20. 
Great happy hours with discounted draughts, slices of pizza. 
This location is a nice one. Outdoor seating, specials on craft bottles on Mondays. 
Nice way to hit the Primanti's experience without heading into the strip."}
{"text":"The description of a Primanti Bros sandwich is tastier than the sandwich itself.  One of two dozen different meats topped with french fries and coleslaw;  I tried hot sausage.  The problem is that all that potato and cabbage mutes the flavor of the meat.  Expecting an extremely tasty sandwich, I found myself adding salt and ketchup.  Regardless of the sandwich not living up to expectations, I would go back if I lived in the area because it is a really pleasant place with draft beer and some outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I wish they had one of these in Wilmington, NC.  Awesome place to eat.  Food was good and nicely priced and the atmosphere was laid back but still classy.  This place was reccomended to me by three different people who had visited Pittsbourgh over the years.  I am very pleased and the left overs were great too!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed visiting here and ordering their 'original' corned beef sandwich where they pile in the cole slaw and fries. There is nothing like having a sandwich meal with a nice cold Yeungling beer (my first one).

Due to its location, it is definitely a college hangout. Service is decent as people come and go. But the food is what makes it here.  So delicious! And with the beer, super delicious! If you haven't tried Permantis yet, go ahead and do it!"}
{"text":"Horribly overrated. 

A goup of five of us driving through Pitt decided to visit this sandwich institution. All five of us had the farts or stomach discomfort. One in the group barfed a few hours later.

The guy cutting the bread was also taking $$$ without using gloves with the food.

Despite the intestinal after party being an epic fail, all of us thought our sandwiches were tasty. I personally reccomend having the egg added to your sandwich. The cole slaw here appears to have no mayo and despite my hatred for cole slaw, i actually enjoyed it.

The fries were slightly a little soggy but were very delicious. The chili ordered on the side was underwhealming and i encourage you not to waste your cash on it.

Overall, I do think I will come back next time im in Pitt"}
{"text":"I like it, people who came up with the idea of putting French fries into a burger is really genius! My friends didn't like it very much though"}
{"text":"It's like going to New York City & not trying Katz! The sandwiches are exactly what the pictures depict---lots of meat and plenty of fries. It's a simple sandwich with a lot of flavor.  We ordered the below items and all of them were delicious. MAKE reservations OR go after the lunch rush, of course it's worth the wait though! 
+pastrami + cheese
+pittz-burger + cheese
+spicy batter dipped pub pickles"}
{"text":"I had to try a sandwich from one of these places because so many people told me about it. To be honest I wasn't impressed. I ordered the loaded fries and the turkey and cheese. I felt the samdwich had more coleslaw and fries than meat! The flavor wasn't bad I just don't like biting down into a sandwich of coleslaw! The fries stole the show for me! They were amazing. I couldn't stop eating them."}
{"text":"It seems that a sandwich here is something you either get or don't get.  I feel fortunate that I get it, and will now be craving a Primanti Bro's sandwich at least once a week for the rest of my life.  Unfortunately I live 4 hours away so those cravings will go unsatisfied.  A pastrami sandwich with a fried egg on top yielded an amazing 5 minutes of my life that I will forever look back on and cherish.  The fries could have been crispier and the server was kind of a weenie, but that wasn't enough to take away from pure sandwich euphoria."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype with this place.  The sandwiches they serve are gross!  Super dry and no good flavor other than the cole slaw.  

They could make them better if they serve them with a sauce.  I asked for my egg over easy and they said no which kind of made angry, you're not eating my sandwich...  Needless to say I think I offended them.  

Other than that the service was good so I gave it two stars."}
{"text":"There is a reason that Primanti Brothers sandwiches are a staple in Pittsburgh. The highest quality meats, breads, cheeses, and produce all combined in an explosion of flavor. Greasy enough to satisfy you in you when you've had to much to drink but not so greasy that you can't eat it with a hangover. I would suggest if you are going to be in town for even a short trip making one of your meals Primanti Brothers. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"If you come to Pittsburgh, you have to make a stop at Primanti Brothers. It has been featured on several travel and food shows like Man Vs. Food.

My friend took me here for dinner and each of us ordered a cheesesteak, which is considered the #2 best seller. This sandwich is HUGE! Mainly because of all the coleslaw and french fries piled high within the sandwich. The cheesesteak itself was okay and the meat looked processed. Not that great. However, the bread is nice and soft. I also ordered a pint of Yuengling on draft. Good beer...

If I do come back, I'm interested in trying the roast beef. It seems like this restaurant is hit or miss depending on what you order. Also the original location is in the Strip district while this location is near the University of Pitt campus, so lots of college students."}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit them during my stay in Pittsburgh because 4 different people had recommended them to me, but when I called in to place a to-go order I was hung up on 3 times!! Horrible customer service! Y'all will not be getting ANY business/ recommendations from me!"}
{"text":"Came here is the late 70's before Food Network etc ever existed. Have always stopped since moving to California BUT the ownership change has let me down!
What had been cheesesteak is now Pitts-burger which was truly a burger before. It's now a oblong patty of mystery beef(?). The rest of the eats seem less quality than I remember also. Fries,slaw and tomato were good as old days as well as the bread."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Got there in the morning before the lunch rush. He sandwich is huge and delicious."}
{"text":"I came back here this evening (a Monday night) after several months away. As usual, it was busy; the parking lot was pretty packed, but we were seated almost immediately. I got a personal pizza and it was just as good as I remember it being. The service was pretty quick, considering the pizzas were made to order.

I also got the bread pudding for dessert. It looks like it changed since my last visit, as it's now served in a glass with a generous helping of whipped cream. I'm not sure if the recipe for the bread pudding itself changed, but I sort of preferred the way it was served before. In addition, my second glass of water tasted funny; I'm not sure if my first glass tasted the same and I didn't notice because of the food. I'm sure there wasn't anything wrong with the water, but I might stick with iced tea next time. 

Overall, I'm glad I got the chance to come back. This location remains one of my favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"After seeing Primanti Brothers featured on a Travel Channel show, I was excited to try it.  We visited the South side location.  So not worth the 45-minute wait and the absolutely crappy service.  

Their signs indicated you could get a grilled or cajun chicken sandwich.  I chose grillled but when my husband ordered, the cashier said they hadn't served that in years and only the cajun was available.  Um, okay...so take the darn false-advertising sign down. 

There was a long line from the time we arrived to the time we left and only four people working; all four were taking orders AND doing the cooking.  the cashier would take a few orders and then ignore the other customers in line for no less than 10 minutes while she helped with the grill.  Ridiculous.  There were some people who eventually left...I don't blame them.  

My order was brought out about 20 minutes before my husband's so of course, I ate since I was starving.  Nothing to brag home about; I threw half of the sandwich away. We had to wait at least another 10 minutes, back in line, for a drink refill.  There was a group who ordered before us who was just getting their food when we left.  He had to go to the other side of the restaurant to a refill on his beer.

I was just really confused about the whole place...it wasn't a sit-down restaurant because there were no official servers, but it most definitely was not \"fast\" food.  .  

It may be a Pittsburgh instituttion, but I would've rather gone to McDonald's for as long as we waited.  Never plan to go back."}
{"text":"We came on a week night. It was busy, but we were seated right away. This place is great to catch up with friends and have some good food and drinks. This is always a go to. The sandwiches are delicious. They also offer a large variety of different craft beers! Always appreciate ipa and a big selection! We got the bacon & cheese sandwich and the salami and cheese sandwich. We both ordered sides of fries with cheese. Everything was great, service was quick, and food was amazing. We never get tomatoes on ours, but the slaw and fries combo is perfect with basically any of their sandwiches! 

Ps.. the Primanti size fry is huge! Trust your waiter when they say it feeds multiple people!"}
{"text":"Whats not to love about Primanti's?  It's a classic.  The quintessential hot spot which any Pittsburgher will tell you that is the heart and soul of our city.  The service is always friendly and speedy.  Beer is always cold and the bartenders are always delightful."}
{"text":"Whoa! What a sandwich! This spot was recommended as a great place for lunch and is known for their sandwiches. We were down the way from the location and decided to give it a try. I was definitely pleased with the meal I got!

First and foremost, the place wreaks of PITTSBURGH, which is fantastic if you're a visitor. With memorabilia every where, you definitely know where you're at. The servers were so nice and gave a really great run down of the menu, even recommending several sandwiches to try. In case you weren't aware, Pittsburgh puts fries on everything, which was a surprise for me. I decided on the Capicola sandwich consisting of spicy italian ham, cole slaw, tomatoes and fries (yes, fries inside the sandwich). IT WAS AMAZING! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Quick service.  There was a line outside waiting to get seated for lunch and it didn't take too long to get seated.  I ordered the colossal fish and cheese and it was good but it wasn't as good as what everyone hypes it up to be. Maybe there are better choices other than the fish."}
{"text":"I LOVE everything about this place. The food, prices, staff, and environment keep me coming back for more. Never been disappointed and hopefully never will. I'm relatively new to the area so when I find a good place it stays on my list and this is a go to place for me, at least once a week!"}
{"text":"We've been to Primanti many times but not to this particular location and before this visit I've never had the pizza except for a plain slice that you can order on the side for a buck (a buck and a half now) when you order a sandwich.

It was about 10pm when we walked over to this place which was almost next door to our hotel.  Primanti has a sort of sports bar feeling to it and it is a bar but it also serves all sorts of food and even has take out beer as well.  I've seen this in places like Alberta that have take out beer from restaurants.  It's a little different than what I'm used to but it's cool.

This time we went with a 18\" gigante supreme which is a pizza with 5 toppings of our choice.  I went with pepperoni, bacon, sausage, onion and mushrooms.  My brother went with a half pound burger and fries.

The pizza was pretty good.  The crust seemed a little chewy but overall it was a nice pie.  The sauce a little sweet as opposed to acidic which was good and the toppings were generous.  For a 18\" 5 topping pizza, 18 bucks is not bad at all for a sit down place.  

I'm usually getting a sandwich with fries in it here but for some reason I wasn't feeling it but the pizza was good.  They have so many different items on the menu at Primanti's I think I've had or sampled almost everything except the wings and gyro by now."}
{"text":"My husband said it very accurately: \"its a once in a lifetime experience.\"  We tried it because it was our first time in Pittsburg, but next time we visit we will pass.  It seems to me that the sandwiches are not anything great once you look past its size.  I ate it with the fries and cole slaw, but I could have done without the fries.  It is just a filler.
The atmosphere as fun and very casual."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros. wins hands down. Great sandwiches, ice cold beer, great service. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Just try it. You won't regret it. We got the cajun chicken sandwich most of the times. And fries."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was told this was one of the places I needed to eat at before leaving Pittsburgh. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the \"Pittsburger\" along with a locally brewed beer which was tasty. The service was great and the atmosphere felt like a historic hometown location. I would recommend this as a place for tourists to eat. It was filled with locals when I went and they were very friendly and engaging and made recommendations for me. Overall I wouldn't consider the sandwiches impressive but I enjoyed their unique take on the cheese burger and felt it was well worth the money."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Pittsburgh this past week for a quick 2 day trip. When we arrived, we wanted to get something close to our Airbnb and after driving from Buffalo for 4 hours and visiting The Night of The Living Dead cemetery, we were definitely ready for lunch. 

I ordered a bacon and cheese sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the assorted cheese sandwich. The sandwiches are quite large and arrive to your table on a wrap instead of a plate. What Primanti's is most-known for is the Cole slaw and fries that are also on the sandwiches instead of on the side. 

Unfortunately, I thought my sandwich really lacked flavor and it basically tasted like I was eating French fries slapped between white bread. It was very dry. The coleslaw was an oil based slaw, whereas I think a mustard or mayo based slaw would have helped with the dryness. I think my boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich and said he'd return again but he's also a vegetarian and loves carbs more than anyone. 

This was my third trip to Pittsburgh and I've had multiple people freak out that I never stopped at Primanti Bros. so that's the main reason why I came here - to say that I did. It didn't do much for me but at least I finally tried it. This is apparently a Pittsburgh staple so if you're visiting the area you might want to check it out. But if you're not really a sandwich person or come from a food-city (like Buffalo NY) then this place can definitely be skipped."}
{"text":"People hyped about this place so much that I went and I was not impressed with their sandwiches at all. It is just a white bun with meat and fries inside to sandwich and you have to season it would ketchup. I was not impressed"}
{"text":"Lifetime Pittsburgher so knew what to expect as I had been to a Primantis many times. First time however to the Market Square location. Food was same as other locations and just what I was looking for. Service however was pathetic. And not to blame our server but the location was obviously understaffed. Waited 20 minutes to order a beer and a sandwich. Waited another 10 for the beer... won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"We waited 15 minutes to be seated with the restaurant being a quarter full. No sight of management. The service is consistently poor at this location. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on Saturday.  after so many people had recommended them we were really disappointed. The resturant was dirty, I mean really dirty. The waiter was less than attentive. They had one guy cooking for a packed restaurant. The waitresses, who looked like they had just rolled out of bed in yoga pants and t-shirts, were constantly flipping and flinging their hair over the food preparation area. Once we got our food it was so sloppily put together we had to reassemble it only to find 2 tiny slices of tomato and a practically non-existant dollop of cheese on each side of our Pittsburger.  We decided against the slaw which appeared to be only dry cabage anyway. It was terribly dry and tastesless.  The only good thing was the mozzarella wedges that kept us from staving while we waited. I saw many of these restaurants around Pittsburgh while we were there but because this one was so nasty with less than stellar wait staff, we won't try them again when we go back. Burgatory was much better!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't think the food here is as good as the hype is about it, but it's a classic \"one of the things you have to do when you visit Pittsburgh\" place. The wings are actually much better than the sandwiches in my opinion. I like the bone-in ones with smokey BBQ sauce, very crispy on the outside! When I get the sandwiches, I don't like their French fries (they're soggy) but I do like their coleslaw a lot and I don't usually like coleslaw. The chili is good, a lot spicier than you would expect! Overall, even though the sandwiches are what they're known for, the wings and chili are your best bet."}
{"text":"As a cap to my \"tour of Pittsburgh,\" why not hit up one more of the area's famous eateries? I know Primanti Brothers is a chain, but it's still great and there's definitely a reason it's so well-known. The \"unique\" concept of the French fries INSIDE the sandwich is pretty cool - It supposedly originated because they used to sell their sandwiches to a lot of truckers (again, we're eating at a \"trucker venue,\" see: \"JoJo's\") who could only use one hand to eat as they drove. Most people would be repulsed at the concept, but it all actually works pretty well together.

The South Side location is convenient to get to, but it was a bit grimy and unkempt. The service, however, was friendly and the prices are awesome - Something like $9 for a big, fresh sandwich. I chose the sandwich with roast chicken (which also has fries, lettuce and tomato between the Italian bread slices) and it was great... Satisfying and definitely something different. They have lots of choices (I think the one with eggs is the most popular), so there's certainly something for whatever suits your mood. The wait for our food wasn't long and there are a scattering of tables and chairs to eat at, though it seems a lot of people take it to go. This is definitely another \"unique\" Pittsburgh experience and one worth seeking out. Since it's a chain in the area, you've got your choices of locations too."}
{"text":"I am still here at Primanti Bros. writing this review.  I been to many Primanti Bros. throughout Pittsburgh  in the past 20yrs. and this establishment on Penn Ave has been the most dirtiest restaurant I've been to since the dirty O ( original 's hotdog shop) in Oakland years ago.  I don't know if they were short staffed or what . One bartender and the poor waiter was running around with his head cut off like a chicken.  My fries were cold on my sandwich and did not taste right, like the meat wasn't done and to top it off my fiancé ordered the Thursday pizza special and the waiter brought dirty silverware and the spatula was  dirty too, like took it from someone else and gave it to us. So he went and ask for plastic silverware and used his hands to get pizza. Well Need to said I didn't eat my sandwich and I will not be returning to this Primanti Bro ever. If this was my first time at a Primanti Bros. and didn't ever eat there food this place definitely would of turned me against the rest. It's a shame"}
{"text":"Good primanti sandwiches.   I got the #2- best seller.   It was a huge burger with coleslaw and fries on it.   Very reasonably priced.  The menu is no longer just sandwiches and they had great beer selections."}
{"text":"Our party of four went here while in town for a conference. We arrived during the noon hour on a Saturday so it was a very busy time with the line stretching outside and a bit down the sidewalk. Luckily the line moved quickly and we were seated in about 15 mins. 

This place was recommended by a good friend of ours and she specifically said have the cheese steak. We're from Maryland so when we hear cheese steak or steak n' cheese we think Philly style or something similar. Well we were not informed of the local Pittsburgh custom or perhaps more specifically that of Primanti Bros. All sandwiches are topped with slaw and fries (as clearly noted on the menu) and I was okay with that and ready to try something new. However, when the sandwiches came out the cheese steak (aka The Pitts-burger on the menu) was salisbury steak patties and the angus steak 'n cheese was angus beef chopped up. Hmmm. 

After being surprised at not seeing a more traditional steak 'n cheese/cheese steak and getting an explanation of what we did get from our server we dug in. Unfortunately we were underwhelmed. Sigh. No particular flavor was evident in the meat or sandwich and the slaw didn't add anything special either. We just didn't get all the hype. After I added salt, pepper and ketchup to my sandwich that helped but still all in all not what I expected or hoped for. Maybe we just weren't ready for this Pittsburgh experience. 

Our service was good though and because one of the orders was wrong it was comped. We appreciated that. All of the staff were very friendly too.

Sorry - not a fan of the food."}
{"text":"http://stevelerer.com

While in Pittsburgh for a family wedding we managed to swing by the original Primanti Bros which was a stop by Adam Richman on Man vs Food. This place is known for it's sandwiches stuffed with french fries and coleslaw just like the fat sandwiches from my college days. It is not known for it's ambiance, so let's get that out of the way and talk about the food. Primanti Bros has grown into a chain but I imagine all the stores look similar. It is a wood table and chair place with a nice old school looking bar. The menu is plastered all over the walls and you can only pay with cash. We grabbed a seat in the second section of the restaurant and waited to place our order.

After a few minutes our waiter came by and we ordered. I decided to check out their #2 best seller, the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak, and a cup of their almost famous chili. Everything came out together and ready to eat. The chili was a seriously tomato based with a smattering of beans and meat throughout. I love chili and I love tomato soup and in my opinion this was a very good tomato soup. Don't get me wrong, it was a good soup but in the end I am privy to the texas style chili with heavy amounts of spicy peppers and a lot more meat.

My sandwich was also pretty good, some serious after drinking food. The bread was nice and thick which held up pretty well to the wet slaw and cheese. So here is when I admit my failure to read menus carefully. I thought that this would be a real cheese steak but I neglected to recognized the play on words in the name Pitts-Burgher. Instead of thinly shaved meat I actually got a burger on this sandwich. I was not expecting that and honestly didn't want it so my review is a little skewed. While the sandwich tasted good I was thrown off by the burger texture with the cole slaw and the non bun bread. The burger was also cooked all the way through which is not to my liking, as I am a rare kind of guy. I found myself wishing I had read more carefully and ordered the pastrami because this sandwich was not for me. Next time we are back in town I will try it again and order the meat I really like and judge it more fairly. I will say though that I have and always will love adding cole slaw and french fries to my sandwiches!

In the end this was a good restaurant with a strong following and I can see why. Cheap and sizable sandwiches for people going on or off shift or stumbling in after a long night of drinking. Pretty much the same reason why the grease trucks at Rutgers do so well but I will take my Fat Darryl over the Pitts-Burgher every time.

Overall Review: 6/10"}
{"text":"Only go here if you want it for the \"Pittsburgh experience\" or a sandwich late at night, not if you are a snobby food lover like me.

We went there for lunch and got chili and the corned beef sandwich. The chili was fine, but it wasn't anything special. We expected more from the sandwich. Sandwich bread and meat were very normal. Fries weren't crispy or flavorful. The cole slaw had a horseradish-y scent, but it wasn't great or anything like I expected (and I usually love most cole slaw!). The highlight of the meal may have been the hot chili, because it was snowing on the day we were there and I was cold.

Service was fine, but the food did not live up to the expectations."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves it here because he's vegetarian but I wasn't impressed by the food :/ ta each is own I guess lol BUT!!! I did love the fact that they had a pool table for me to play!!!"}
{"text":"WOW was this place good and cheap! I had the cheesesteak, and I was not expecting it to be covered in as many french fries as it was... It was phenomenal! As a New Yorker, I always HAVE to get a cheesesteak if possible (when not in Philadelpha!) so getting one at Primanti's was an easy choice to make. Ive heard about this place from multiple people and heard only good things. I love how its a chain, hopefully they will expand out to New York! Had a nice bar atmosphere, almost didnt realize it was a restaurant!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I simply had to eat at the famous Primanti's while in Pittsburgh, and the Market Square location was most convenient to our hotel. The place was packed to the gills on a Saturday night, so we ate at the bar. Fast service. Excellent sandwich, not quite as big as we feared. :-) A really cheap dinner!

My only quibble is that they had a \"wait here\" sign on the host stand but it was not staffed, and we waited a couple of minutes before going in. Not a major issue."}
{"text":"Stopped in mid afternoon and had a great lunch and a cold brew. Delicious sandwich and great service. Nice outdoor area to people watch. So much nicer than their new restaurant close to us in dayton."}
{"text":"the harmarville primantis is not so great - service is always slow and the younger servers are really not into what is going on there...they are jsut going thru the motions to get their shift over with!   downtown is the best and cranberrys location is swell."}
{"text":"Food is good,waitresses are friendly ..overall a 4 out of 5! 
Ambiance need to be worked on it seems like they have not updated the seating area since the 1990's"}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is a Pittsburgh staple! The Burgh take on the classic sandwiches. You begin with delicious Italian bread which is filled with the scrumptious meat of your choice and then French fries and slaw are piled high to complete these monster sandwiches. 

This location has plenty of parking and is relatively large inside. It gives you that sports bar feel rather than a downtown sandwich joint like you get in the warehouse district. The inside is relatively clean and the waitress we had on our last visit was pretty attentive even though we had a large party. 

I think the prices are fine for what you get from the sandwiches. That is what partly makes the restaurant a must go. Their reputation could allow them to charge more but they don't do that. This is definitely a hometown fav. Try it when you come through!"}
{"text":"I heard good things..after all Primanti Brothers have developed a nice chain in the area.

Great service very helpful...I had the guys pick the sandwich for me.  I got There best selling burger....it was a hamburger with fries in it.   Not a fan of the idea.  Overall kinda boring(Sorry) but it is what it is.  The meat tasted like meat which was a nice change but the toppings were just down right sad.  Fries where a  step up from the norm and for a price of under 7 bucks it sure beats any fast food chain."}
{"text":"On my way back from dropping my Daughter off in Ann Arbor, I decided to make my solo return home s bit of a foodie side trip.  I diverted from my planned return route to experience the Primanti Bros. sandwiches.  Thanks to GPS I was able to find this fabled restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District.  After parking my car for $6 I headed towards Primanti Bros.  There was a long line but thankfully two large parties ahead of me.  Since I was solo I got in quickly and was seated at the bar.  TV's everywhere showing college football.  Very lively bar scene.  I perished the menu and decided on the pastrami sandwich which comes with tomato, coleslaw, and French fries.  I was so excited to be there that I
mistakenly ordered more fries.  The sandwich served on white bread arrived after the fries which were outstanding.  I bit into the sandwich and I was in love.  I normally hate coleslaw as it is creamy but this vinegary slaw was the perfect complement to the pastrami and fries.  Every bite was wonderful.  The layers of flavor in this sandwich were singing to me.  I wish I could have brought them home.  I devoured it and then settled up to
Make room for more patrons.  Picked up a T-shirt on the way out.  So if you are in Pittsburgh this is a must visit.  Well worth the detour!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Pittsburgh from Florida a friend took me here.  I thought it was great.  The idea of french fries in a sandwich?  Love it!  After seeing french fries in salads this was nothing.....  I loved the bread used and the fact that they sold beer too.   The place was extremely small and a bit cramped, the only downside."}
{"text":"Have been to this location twice. Inattentive staff so when you actually have the attention of the waitstaff, don't forget anything...or it'll be an exercise in frustration!  On the other hand, the staff was friendly enough and efficient for such a busy place. Don't expect plates or utensils.  (It's a great way to keep their costs down.) First time, I ordered a Pitts-burger. Meat was like a dry, flavorless hockey puck. Reminded me of school lunch 25 years ago. Second time I was there, had an Angus sirloin steak (not a solid piece or a pressed patty, as I expected, but more like chipped meat pieces piled together) and it was awesome! Delicious!  Saved my experience. Fries piled on top and I love the vinegar based coleslaw. Bam! Could eat it all day! And I tried my sons Colossal fish: deep fried heaven."}
{"text":"There are many locations to choose from but I prefer the one in the Strip District or Market Square.  I am not a fan of their infamous sandwiches but they have excellent pizza!  Actually the best location for pizza is their Harmar location.  They do have an appetizer menu special for happy hour but I would advise getting the wings on a different day.  They tend to be soggie, cold or taste like they have been sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"So being from out of town and seeing this place on several Food Network shows I thought there had to be something behind the hype. Well I'll break it down like this. 

Food - B   I had big hopes for what looks to be an amazing sandwich but it fell flat. I do like that you can select your meats but the fries on the sandwich are bland. The slaw is a nice addition, and the meat is decent. It's a great idea to combine your meal between bread but it needed more flavor. You get a large portion so that's a bonus. The street fries again look tasty but just don't hit the mark. Kids chicken strips were standard frozen tenders, nothing great. 

Staff - B-   It was busy as these places always are but the waitress was gone forever in between our order and getting the check and paying. Took way too long to get out the door. She was nice and explained the story and how the place works but with the no nonsense  attitude you expect. 

Atmosphere = A- They defiantly support their city. It's all Pittsburgh. Nice bar area and packed so the locals must like it."}
{"text":"It's not just the sandwhich, it's the experience people!  As Steeler fans, my family came all the way from LA to catch a game, and of course. . . A Primanti Bros. sandwhich.  We visited the location at The Strip and it was amazing!  We went there on the first night we arrived, close to midnight.  Guy behind the counter was conservatively friendly- very Pittsburgh.  I'm a vegetarian so I ordered a meatless sandwhich but went heavy on cheese and ketchup, Heinz of course.  It was crazy good, especially when it's chased down by a Yuengling. Love the city, love the people, love the Primantis.  Bread might even be better than San Francisco's!  What?!"}
{"text":"First, their fries that are a part of the famous sandwiches deserve to be enjoyed by themselves as we'll.   these are some of the bet darn fries I have ever had.   The sandwiches are wonderful.  We had the roast beef, ham and cheese steak.  All were great.   The combination of the fries, tangy coleslaw and fresh soft bread make a perfect sandwich.   I would have had a side of the coleslaw as ell, could I fit another bite in my stomach.   These sandwiches are massive by the way (although I don't think that is much of a secret)"}
{"text":"This was my second time going to Primanti Bros, and my first time going to the one in the strip district.  I freaking loved the sandwich I ate, which was the cheese combo with 2 eggs.  Absolutely mouth watering and filling.  The price is right, the wait was non-existent on a weekday and the service at the bar was prompt.  You have to try this location, as I can tell it's just overall much nicer than the other location I went to previously (southside---argh that Primanti was like a dump compared to this one).  The overall environment is actually inviting.  Just a nice place to hang.

This place drops a star because they don't have Tabasco sauce.  Only Red Devil.  Nothing wrong with Red Devil, but seriously, they need to step their game up in the hot sauce department."}
{"text":"I went to the Primanti's on South Side for lunch on a Monday.  I actually wasn't planning on going to South Side, but I got lost navigating through Oakland and ended up on a bridge.  Typical Clevelander trying to navigate the burgh. Figuring that I had to at least try this Pittsburgh tradition before leaving town, I stopped by.

Service was prompt and on cue.  I ordered the cheese combo sandwich which was two slices of thick white break containing a mound of cole-slaw, large-cut fries and melted cheese.  

The sandwich was ridiculously large as expected and very filling, though became kind of overwhelming after a few bites.  The taste was good, but nothing to write home about in my honest opinion.  I personally find that the large amount of coleslaw kind of overpowers the sandwich.  The bread got soggy pretty quick and became less appetizing by the minute.  

Who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it?  Give it a shot if you haven't experienced it before.  Just wasn't quite for me."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised!  I went in with low expectations after seeing the so-so reviews and hearing from people that it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Got the steak sandwich with everything on it.  I ate most of it and wasn't even that hungry to begin with.  Definitely needed salt/pepper and the hot sauce they had.  When you add potatoes to a sandwich it tends to make it taste bland unless you have a killer sauce.  The sandwich could feed most people for two meals and it's only $7..great value.  23 oz miller lite was only $4..also so cheap.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the head cook make quick work of 100+ sandwiches.  These people got the routine down pat.  I would definitely eat it again and appreciate the history of the place."}
{"text":"This place is dirty. Sat in the bar area and it had a weird smell like stagnant water or something. Food was good as ever and service was good. But this place needs a good scrub down!"}
{"text":"I spent my entire college career living with folks who were born and raised in Pittsburgh, and as such I've heard about Primanti's many times over.

I finally made my way to Pittsburgh and the Strip District to try it first-hand.  We saddled up to the bar right behind where the food is made.  Had the Pastrami w/ fried egg and...it tastes exactly like I thought it would (which is a good thing).  I was surprised at how high-quality the pastrami was.  This is probably not somewhere I would eat regularly, but I appreciated the experience.

One note:  I was AMAZED to watch the sandwiches being made.  I was there during the lunch rush and all of the sandwiches are made by only one person.  She cuts the bread (once every 5-6 sandwiches or so), works the griddle filled with meat and eggs, makes all of the fries, etc.  It is impressive.  She deserves every dollar she makes!"}
{"text":"Deliciously different!  I ordered capicola (ham) & cheese, hubby had corned beef.  Wasn't sure how the combo would taste with the slaw, tomato, and fries crammed in the middle...but WOW!  The tangy slaw and crispy fries were the perfect contrasting compliment to the sandwich meat.  None of the flavors were overpowering, they all melded perfectly together.  The fries in the sandwich and in the basket were a bit bland and needed a good sprinkling of salt, but once the salt was added, it was perfect.  This particular branch was not too busy, plenty of parking, we had an attentive young waitress (Jess) and we were served in a timely manner.  Glad to have stopped in.  The next time we're in the Pittsburgh area, we will make it a point to come back!"}
{"text":"Being out of town, I wanted to experience something truly local on my first trip. I was satisfied with the industrial look of the strip district and just as satisfied with the pittsburger. It takes some work to eat because it's stacked with fries and coke slaw in he sandwich but it's worth it. The white bread is a different take on a burger that really works well."}
{"text":"Came out from Philly for a wedding.  Went here twice while out here. Food was outstanding. Burgers were fresh made and the other items were just as good. Prices were average, and the staff every time I went in was extremely friendly. When I come back out to see my brother again I will return."}
{"text":"The meat and cheese of your choice topped with slaw and fries is what I call a sandwich!  They are huge and delicious.  I couldn't eat these all the time, but always a must when in the Burgh."}
{"text":"I grew up near Pittsburgh and remember eating Primantis as a kid. I always hated the fries on my sandwich but learned to love it. I recommend the Salami, Angus Cheesesteak, Capicola, and even the Burgher Cheesesteak. A true Pittsburgh staple."}
{"text":"Sandwich was all bread and lettuce with very little meat - I don't understand the draw to this place - never again"}
{"text":"Been to Primanti's in FL before and was excited to see where it all began when I was in town to catch some hockey and football.  Made the mistake of ordering the cheese steak not knowing it was a patty of some kind.  Still love the place but would recommend the Pastrami overall and don't forget CHEESE on your fries ... good cocktails too and at decent prices."}
{"text":"Best drunk sandwich concept- had it
For lunch :) 
Recommend adding egg to anything!!
Service was quick, some people also ate a pizza slice with the sandwich! 
I will be back- very interested in trying the other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Not bad. I honestly don't know what else needs to be said about this place. Customer service has been great so far. Would come again occasionally."}
{"text":"Oh, what can I say about Primanti Bros. 
My husband and I ate there because we were told we had to try it as it's a Pittsburgh institution. 
The fried zucchini appetizer was alright. I did like that it was cut the long way.
The sandwiches were not appealing. I had the pittsburger. The meat had no taste and the fries in the sandwich did nothing but add starchy, film to the roof of my mouth. 
My husband had the Carolina pork, which was better, but only because of the BBQ sauce. 

We were seated promptly, but the server barely looked at us when she spoke and twice I had to ask her to repeat herself. (I do not have bad hearing.)

We ate the food. We didn't die, but it certainly was not worth our time."}
{"text":"I kept reading about Primanti Brothers on suggested places to eat when visiting Pittsburgh so I had to try it out. I got the kielbasa and cheese sandwich which was very good. My only suggestion is less coleslaw on the sandwich which isn't a big deal because I can easily just remove some. My husband got the Pittsburger, and he loved it. He was in Pittsburgh last month on a business trip and went to two other locations which he didn't care for. He said that the location in the strip district area (surrounded by warehouses) makes the sandwiches the best! Next time I visit Pittsburgh, I will be returning to this location to try another sandwich!"}
{"text":"We were in town this last weekend to watch a Steeler's game and we had to make a stop at Primanti Bros.  We had a couple cheese steak and roast beef sandwiches and some Yuengling's.  Per usual the service is excellent the food comes out pretty quick.  

This is a popular place so if you are coming on a weekend (Especially during football season) then expect to wait in line.  Otherwise go mid-week.  Also this is a place for meat and potato lovers!!

Toni H. took care of our group and got us seated pretty quickly.  And of course we had to take some pic's with her.   This is a must have if you are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is a cool little place to go to grab a quick bite to eat. We were referred by a few people in the area and we were not disappointed. The environment is really chill and the food was amazing. The burgers and how they create them are great! Must try if you're around the area!"}
{"text":"Good place to have a sandwich. Outside tables were a nice place to sit and enjoy the city. Slaw was excellent!"}
{"text":"Did not eat at this location but couldn't find the location to Yelp my review. Still wanted to review Primanti Bros. I forgot the name of my order but it's there most popular sandwiches. It had cheeseburger and fries and I had the cole slaw on the side. It was tasteful and delicious. Would highly recommend trying Primanti Bros"}
{"text":"After learning of how famous Primanti is (it was named best sandwich by the Food Network), I decided to indulge in one of the most unhealthy yet amazing sandwiches I have yet to try. Every local I met in Pittsburgh said I needed to try it and so that is how I ended up at this location, which to my belief is the original. 

I had the pastrami & cheese. But it is not just pastrami and cheese. It's pastrami and cheese between two pieces of sourdough bread, coleslaw, and fat french fries. At first, I had no idea how I was going to eat it since it was larger than my mouth could fit, but I worked something out. It tasted pretty much like heaven. I would definitely come back anytime I'm in Pittsburgh.

The location has a nice older diner kind of feel. And the strip district outside is a nice place to walk around if you're looking for places to shop or explore."}
{"text":"What a great place with great eats!  Awesome sandwiches - I had a taste of two sandwiches half a pastrami and a capicola and both were topped off by Coleslaw and French Fries. Which went down nicely with out Iron City beers!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We come to Pittsburgh once a year for out annual Steelers Game. This place was close to the hotel and reviews were good, so we stopped by. We loved every bite. WE came around happy hour so we tried a little of everything (we had a picky group with us that trip). EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. This place was so good that we stopped a total of 3 times while in town. I think its official we have found a new local favorite."}
{"text":"This place was really good. We went based on a recommendation given to my sister. Since it was 6 of us we tried different things. John Michael was our waiter and he was amazing. He was very attentive. Now when it comes to the food we loved the queso, mozzarella squares, wings and Sangria. Neither one of us enjoyed the sandwiches. We all agreed the sandwiches were dry and more bread than meat. I wasn't a big fan of the fries on my burger but the coleslaw was really good. Happy hour was from 4-6 although the website says 5-7 but I still enjoyed the red Sangria. This was a great recommendation and I could see myself returning especially for the wings when in the area."}
{"text":"I had the sirloin steak sand which & my wife has the turkey & cheese - it was pretty good. This was my 1st time in Pittsburg and everyone I spoke too said PrimantiBrothers was a MUST. With all the hype, I was a little letdown. I thought the fries in the sand which dried it out a little. The bread was good though - I can say I even eaten there, but it's not something I care to eat again"}
{"text":"If you've never been to a Primanti's, definitely check out the one in the Strip District for the \"authentic\"
experience. That being said, the Oakland location is as good as any for a quick Pittsburgh staple. Service here is usually great and orders are filled quickly.

My personal favorite is a capicola with egg and onion. Whatever you get, leave the coleslaw and fries on the sandwich and add an egg, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Just the same as always! Good and fun! The food shows bring in too many lookie lous that want to order some kind of foo foo salad though........"}
{"text":"This place has a friendly atmosphere.

My sandwich was stacked high with all the fixin's that go on the pittsburgher. It was more than enough for one person. Especially if you plan to walk around the strip district afterwards.

There is a lot of history behind the famous sandwich shop which makes visiting this original location that much more special."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Primanti Bros. sandwiches. A must go if its your first time in the city as it is a Pittsburgh staple. 

My favorite is the Pittsburgher with cheese and a fried egg. Second favorite is the Capicola with cheese and a fried egg. In my opinion you should always get a fried egg on your Primanti sandwich. 

Also a little insider info... If your are wondering what their number 1 seller is... It's beer (more specifically Iron City, or Arhn City if your are a Yinzer)"}
{"text":"Wildly overrated.  I compare it to Pat's and Geno's in Philly, good when your drunk, but only when your drunk.

I went to Pitt for 4 years and I have to say I never understood the Primantis hype.  I dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck.  They are soggy and tasteless, maybe the worst I've ever had.  I will say the coleslaw is pretty good, and I'm not usually a coleslaw guy, but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings.  

Half the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The \"cheesesteak\" might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.  

Primantis sucks...go to Fatheads on the Southside or Uncle Sam's in Oakland."}
{"text":"Everyone that comes to Pittsburgh must try Primanti Bros at least once. I have been there multiple times but this is my first review of the place. The sandwich is something to see and eat especially after a night of drinking. The original location is definitely the best especially for the people watching aspect. 

I chose the sandwich with bacon and cheese and it was definitely consistent with the other times I have been there, but I will say this after you have gone once you will never need to go back unless its late and you need something to soak up the alcohol."}
{"text":"Putting a pile of fries and coleslaw on a sandwich is definitely original. It's also bland and unwieldy. Toast or garlic buns would help also, instead of putting it all on tasteless white bread. They do get a star for being open late, and the prices are more than fair."}
{"text":"It's always a great place to watch the pens game. The food is good, lots of TVs, and great specials during the game. I think that my only complaint would have to be that it gets rather crowded and can be a long wait for a table."}
{"text":"Got the pastrami and it was super good! I heard this was a must try and it did not disappoint. Went at 1:00 on a Tuesday and service was quick. It's a good Pittsburgh experience and the sandwich is good and soooo filling! If you are in Pittsburgh I would suggest this for something different from the usual food."}
{"text":"Love the lamp giro! World class tasting!"}
{"text":"I heard from everyone that the Primanti sandwiches are the quintessential Pittsburgh food. 

We scored a nice seat outside and indulged in some Iron Hill beer that was on special for $2 for a  20 oz beer. The sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive.

Be warned that everything here comes with french fries, even the salads."}
{"text":"Wanted to see why the reviews are so high for this place.  I have to say it was an experience to try at least once while visiting Pittsburgh.  We sat at the counter and that was a fun to eat there.  We shared a Pastrami sandwich and I thought the meat portions were small, mostly cold slaw and fries in your sandwich.  The pastrami was average and I would have liked more of that then the other items.  It was a big sandwich and enough for us.  We didn't have to order any fries, but we forgot it was in the sandwich.  The fries could be crisper and I thought they were tasty, but too soft for me.

Overall, I say go there once to experience it.  There's not a lot of attention from the staff, bc the place is so busy.  I don't need to go back.   If you miss getting a chance to eat there.....then catch it the next time you visit, not a must to visit."}
{"text":"Really glad I don't live close to this place or I would be a major fatty.... Loved the coleslaw/tomatos/french fries on every sandwich, what a great combo! I will def make it a priority to come back when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3.  I've been here several times, and I'll probably visit again.  Here's my take:

GOOD:
- It's quite big.  Lots of tables.  Bar is huge.
- It's got a neat feel inside.  It's a very old lodge, converted to a restaurant, so there are big, wooden beams in the ceiling, a giant stone fireplace, and some cool animal heads on the wall, staring at you while you eat.
- The food is consistent and good.  The big sammies are just like the ones in the Strip District.
- The menu is LARGE, with lots more stuff than they offer at the original location (e.g., entree salads, wings, pizza, nachos, burgers, etc.).

NOT SO GOOD:
- The parking lot is not quite large enough to accommodate the large size inside.  And given the location, there are no street-parking or other alternatives.  If you can't park, you can't eat.
- The floor and some of the booths are just a little STICKY!  Is this place really that clean?  Mercifully, it's dimly lighted, so I can't really see what might scare me under good lighting...
- Some of the servers act like they'd rather be elsewhere.  Others are good.  Hit or miss on service."}
{"text":"The first day I landed in Pittsburgh my Uber driver and  few other folks gave a tip to try this place out. Tried the chicken sandwich and fries 
Pros:
Open 24 hours 
Good quantity for price

Cons:
Sandwich was very dry
A bit dirty 

Good for native Pittsburgh experience and when you are hell drunk and want something to bite on."}
{"text":"Ok for the non-Pgher that is used to semi-healthy food, this place will gross you out.  At least it did gross me out.  

First of all, I don't want my fries on my sandwich.  If I am going to order them (which is what, once a month maybe?) I want them on the side.  And if the guy is going to bother deep fat frying them, the least he can do is let them sit there long enough to cook rather than just giving them a fat dip.  And draining them would be nice too!!  

The bread was cut from what appeared to be an Italian loaf but it was all crumbly... and after fries (strike that: grease laden uncooked potatoes) were added it was saturated with oil.

There's no lettuce, no tomato, no semblance of anything remotely edible on the once wax paper, now grease dripping mess, that is thrust at you.  

I'm sorry but this is just gross and inedible.  I could just about feel my arteries clog!"}
{"text":"Oh Primantis how many a late night snack or a weekday lunch  stop have we had?  Countless... There really isn't much I haven't tried from their menu.  I can recall eating here several times for lunch and feeling like I needed a nap and a shower when I got back to the office.  Very, very messy.  And that being said there isn't much I don't like.  The quality and quantity of food you receive is well matched to the price.  I personally can't finish an entire sandwich in one sitting and usually that is a good thing because all though I love it, me and greasy food tend not to  get along...

So Primanti just missed that 5 stars for the sometime sporadic service.  I have had really nice waitresses/waiters and not so nice ones.  I sat at the counter for lunch and I don't think the lady that took my order smiled once at me.  You know that look of complete yinzer annoyance?  Well she was dishing it up plenty along with the crispy coleslaw, otherwise would have easily been a 5 stars and a great staple of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"For being the must do in Pittsburgh, it was a huge disappointment. I ordered the Pitts-burger. It was an obvious processed meat patty. Think Swansons Salisbury steak minus the gravy. The cole slaw was dry, where's the dressing? There are many better options in Pittsburgh. *thumbs down*"}
{"text":"So bad. I wanted to try their sandwiches for a really long time. But it's way too much overhyped. You've to try to believe that something could be so overhyped!! For one thing, I hate raw un-toasted bread for my sandwich. I tried something with sardines. It was so dry and felt like a waste of everything - money, time and calories."}
{"text":"The food was alright but didn't live up to the hype.  I had the angus steak sandwich and it really didn't have much steak at all.  It was pretty much a bread, cole slaw and french fries sandwich garnished with steak.  With that said, it was actually pretty good.  The bar itself seemed like a good place to stop on your way home from work to sneek in a beer or two."}
{"text":"On my road trip across the US, my sisters and I took a detour to Pittsburgh because we had to try a sandwich at Primanti Brothers. We had heard about this place and seen things about on TV and we felt we couldn't pass up the opportunity since we didn't know if we'd ever be back in PA. It was one of the best detours I have ever taken! 

We'd been on the road for hours so we ended up stopping in at about 11pm on a Wednesday. Thankfully they're open 24hrs. We ordered a corn beef sandwich and a cheese-steak. The sandwiches are beautiful-if you're into overflowing goodness of fries and slaw. Unfortunately the guy got our order mixed up with someone else's and we ended up with a ham sandwich, not the cheese-steak. We were really looking forward to having a real cheese-steak since we were in the area. Alas, not to be. But our sandwiches were awesome and I just wish I could have try another..."}
{"text":"I used to be able to eat 3 cap n' cheeses per sitting  Now however I only can eat 1 per sitting.  :\  Yes I may be getting older but I still enjoy every bite."}
{"text":"Primanti's taste  better drunk then it does when sober and is a great greasy gut busting way to prevent hangovers.

I had my beer goggles  on and while in my drunken haze I feasted upon immaculate cheese fries and Cajun rub wings. That meal sobered me right up!"}
{"text":"I Loved this place. The server was attentive and friendly and the food was wonderful. The pastrami was seasoned perfectly. Everything came to the table hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I mean, I guess you have to go if you are in Pittsburgh. I ordered the Pittsburger and was disappointed since the burger itself didn't add much to the flavor. The fries on top of a sandwich is a great idea and I hope that if I order something different I will have a better experience. I would go back and order something different to give it another shot."}
{"text":"There is not much to add to the other reviews regarding Primanti Brothers.  I don't always eat Primanti sandwiches, but when I do, I try to do it at the one in the Strip District. I like the atmosphere here as you never know what you can expect.  Though, during the day, it is usually much more tame then once the sun goes down.  You find all sorts of people here, all in the mood for a stomach busting sandwich with your favorite meat, french fries, slaw and two big pieces of bread.

It was not as crowded today as expected, so we were able to get a seat at the bar.  Our servers were extremely prompt and efficient.  Sandwiches were great today. I had the Jumbo Baloney (one of my favorites).  

I always recommend to tourists to try this place as it is a long lasting tradition.  Definitely a good place to go sober, drunk or when looking for a hangover cure.  Good comfort food."}
{"text":"Guy who helped us provided excellent customer service. Even offered my 6 year old a sandwich with fries on side (which made him feel special). I ordered pastrami and cheese. He brought all of our sandwiches and asked if we needed condiments. My sandwich was AMAZING and my son loved his triple cheese. Fries were hot and crispy. I love how Pittsburgh the place feels and hope they don't ever change."}
{"text":"Ever since seeing Primanti Brothers featured on both Food Network and Man vs Food, I developed a craving for the famed Pittsburgh stuffed sandwich.  On a recent trip to the Steel City, I went to the Forbes Ave. (Oakland) location for a sample.

Even around 9PM on a Wednesday, the place was pretty packed.  Took a seat and was immediately asked what I wanted.  They have over 20 sandwich options, so I needed a moment to figure out my selection.  I opted for the cheesesteak, which they proclaim is their #2 most requested.  Oddly, they do not tell you what the top pick is.  Anyway, ordered a tall Yuengling (it is much better on draft than in the bottle, so don't hate) and within minutes my sandwich arrived.  It's a good thing the bread is so squishy, otherwise it would be impossible to get the thing in your craw.  Be advised on the cheesesteak, though.  This is not the Philly version.  In fact, the meat looked like some pre-formed, processed patty.   Despite this, the sandwich was tasty with nicely contrasting flavors and textures.  

Although I should have been as stuffed as the sandwich afterwards, I was still feeling a little hungry.  I ordered a capicola (at the recommendation of our waitress) and ate it back at the hotel.  That was a much tastier and more satisfying version.

You can buy tall boys and 6 packs to-go at this location.  May have something to do with its proximity to the colleges.  By the way, this is not the original location.  That would be the one in the Strip district, which is also the one featured on TV."}
{"text":"Alas. Primanti Brothers has completely sold out and massively expanded. I pine for the days of a nice rugged heap of sandwich the way it used to be.

Maybe it is just that this is a different location, but I didn't really feel like this was the same sandwich I had so many times before. The bread didn't seem the same and the meat wasn't quite there either. Also the fries seemed underdone. 

It is what it is, and I certainly got my fix during this visit to Pittsburgh, but I might have been better off going to the location in The Strip."}
{"text":"Damn you travel channel and food network for hyping this place up!

I was in Pittsburgh recently on business, and I was pretty excited to check out Primanti Brothers.  I didn't realize they had more than 1 restaurant, so when I found out they were close to the hotel I was staying at, I was pretty excited.

My friend and I went there for lunch and the place looked alright- lots of Pittsburgh sports decor, pretty decent size.  We were waiting for the hostess to seat us, but soon realized there was no dedicated hostess.  After about 5 minutes, we got seated (not sure why it took so long).

Our server asked us if this was our first time here, and yes, it certainly was.  She showed us the menu which was primarily sandwiches, and other standard bar menu items.  Their big thing is their sandwiches that are served on Italian bread with coleslaw and fries in it.  That's what I had seen on tv, so I ordered their #2 best seller (#1 is iron city beer) which was a ground beef sandwich with cheese and the aforementioned toppings.  My friend kind of let me down, and ordered chicken wings and fries.

The good- it was a relatively quick lunch, which was nice.  Plus they have this special where you can get a slice of pizza for $1 with any lunch purchase.  I elected to not get it, because I had heard these sandwiches were huge (I'll get to that in a bit).  My friend seemed to enjoy his chicken wings well enough.

The bad- so I got my sandwich, and yeah it was big, but the bulk of it was coleslaw.  I'm not a huge coleslaw, but I figured I had to try it.  It wasn't bad by any means, but not the earth shattering moment that I had hoped for.  I easily finished the sandwich, and considered getting the pizza at that point, but I elected not to be that unhealthy.

The mediocre- overall, I would say I'm glad I tried this place, but if I were local to this place, I probably wouldn't come back.  The people at the hotel I was staying at warned me it was a tourist trap, but they didn't have any decent alternatives, so I went with what I have heard about.  Actually, I take it back.  If I were watching a game or something, I would probably go here.  The sandwiches are pretty reasonably price, and for the money, it's tough to beat.  Primanti brothers- you're just ok."}
{"text":"I knew how popular Primanti Bros. sandwiches were for locals, tourists, and anyone who comes to the Pittsburgh area.  I was going to just try it once at the original Strip District location and not try it ever again.  

Of course, what happens?  I end up eating a sandwich every day that I stayed in the city, including buying a sandwich for the road before heading out.  

What makes these sandwiches so great and craveable?  No not cocaine laced in the meats but it just simply works.  The fries, slaw, meat, and bread just works together well.  And one sandwich is all you need to get full.  I wouldn't recommend eating two because that will lead to regrettable overeating stomach pains.

I did enjoy the old school vibe of the original location as I saw a bunch of old regulars sitting at their stools when I came in.  Also very old school style: they yelled out to the dining room to tell that a car in the parking lot had left their headlights on.  Priceless and not something you see every day when you sit in your average restaurant.

I've had the Capone with capicola, salami, and Italian sausage, the Jumbo Bologna, and the corned beef.  All were equally delicious and satisfying.  I'm so lucky that Primanti's is not on the West Coast because I'd become a fatty in absolutely no time.  So yes I'll miss your delicious sandwiches but at the same time, I won't miss your starchy calories as much as I enjoy eating them.

I definitely recommend going to the Strip District location as it is worth seeing the place where it all started.  The environment and atmosphere of the original really can't be duplicated anywhere else."}
{"text":"When you are in Pittsburgh, everyone will insist you go to Primanti bros! 

I'm happy I went just so I can say I've tried it but I think its just ok. The sandwiches are decently priced but I'm not a huge fan of fries and coleslaw in my sandwich. I'm fine with these sides on the side really.

I got the pastrimi sandwich and it was tasty. I had to add a lot of the hot sauce to it to get some extra flavor to it though.

It's a great price for a decent sized sandwich and paired with a nice cold beer, it's a great combo!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here won't ever be as good as those prepared at the original location in the strip, but they're still pretty darn good...and even better after a number of beers ;-). This location however is very close to the house and very family friendly for sure, so I'm here more than any other location. They have Great pizza deals on Tuesday & Thursday. Most importantly though is the very friendly and attentive service staff...even with kids in the mix. Thanks keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Primanti's is a great Pittsburgh tradition! The sandwiches are huge and have a choice of meat, french fries, vinegar based cole slaw and cheese. I always enjoy my meal and it is a great experience for our of towners. I have been to many of the locations but the market square location is my favorite!"}
{"text":"This is usually the one we prefer. Well today they obviously were short staffed. However no apology to everyone waiting for 30 mins to be seated when there were empty tables. I would of loved to just be seated and order a drink while we waited to order our food. The poor staff was running like chickens with their heads cut off. We ended up leaving without being seated as we couldn't take not just standing there being ignored."}
{"text":"Got the Pittsburgh and I must say it was quite disgusting.  I wouldn't even feed it to my dog. For something thats there 2nd best seller i expected something amazing. Barely edible could not finish it. Other than that the staff was very friendly and polite. Just stay away from the pittsburger it's dog chew. Hopefully this helps."}
{"text":"This is always a must stop for anyone who visit Pittsburgh.  As a foodie who wouldn't love french fries and coleslaw on there sandwich!  Friendly people,wait staff is great if you never been they will explain and make recommendations."}
{"text":"Must visit for any coming to visit Pittsburgh.  All the sandwich contain french fries and coleslaw a foodie heaven!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've had Primanti's. The first being about 10 years ago so I had to try again to reacquaint myself with Pittsburgh's culinary claim to fame.  For an added experience, I had to go to the original location.  For the place being as old as it says, you don't get the entire feel of it, but that's ok.  It's an intimate spot to get a sandwich with the closest of your fellow strangers and tourists.  

I first ordered the Smallman Street Fries.  Named after the street of the original location, they've got chili, cheese, jalapeños, and sour cream on it.  I should've just stopped eating here because my meal peaked already.  For the sandwich, I went with the Pitts-burger, their #2 best seller.  I asked what that meant and was told it was a joke.  I guess I didn't get the joke or it just wasn't obvious and funny. Probably the latter.  I wish I remembered what the sandwich was like because this was awful.  While trying to eat it, I was trying to figure out how and why this got to be so popular in this area.  The meat was more like a mystery meat that tasted gross.  Who knows what animal this came from.  As for the cole slaw, it had no flavor to it and seemed to be missing something.  I'd say the bread is the saving grace, but not for this sandwich.  It's a very good thick piece Italian, but for a sandwich like this it needs to be a bit harder with all of the ingredients in it.  

Lastly, I feel the need to comment on the service.  I rarely do unless it's extremely good or bad.  Unfortunately, it was not good.  Three different staff members served us.  After the food was brought out to the table, the server said someone will be right over to refill the drinks.  Ok fine.  After a few minutes, no one came over.  I started wondering why she herself didn't refill the drinks.  I had to eat the entire meal without anything to drink.  Not refilling drinks might be my biggest pet peeve dining out.  Thanks for being consistent Primanti's!  Terrible service to go with terrible food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants but tonight discouraged me. We arrived at 11:31pm and seated immediately but we did not see a waitress for 11 minutes. When Jess came towards our table, I noticed she had gotten up from another table with her (non-employee) friends. I have never had an issue with any restaurant in the Primanti's chain until this. The rest of the service was prompt and the food was good as usual, just watch out for Jess.
That being said, the manager brought us our food and after a brief discussion the problem was solved and were compensated accordingly."}
{"text":"I am visiting from California and was very disappointed with the service and food. It was all bread and coleslaw. The waiter was not nice at all!  Blah!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently had my first Primanti Brothers experience as a relative Pittsburgh newbie, and I must say it was delicious! I ordered the steak sandwich and it didn't disappoint. The meat was sliced more thinly than I had imagined it would be, however it made eating the monstrosity much easier. Obviously Primanti Bros knows what it's doing in that regard! Lots of people have described a Primanti sandwich to me as having \"fries all over the top of it\", so I was surprised to see the fries shoved right in the middle of the sandwich and cut in half. Since I ended up saving half for later I really liked the way they did that honestly. Additionally the massive yuengling drafts were super cheap the night my boyfriend and I went, so with half of a massive Pittsburgh sandwich I treated myself to the most Pennsylvanian beer one could drink. (A departure from my imperial stout fanaticism) I'll most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Waitress was awesome. Very attentive, pleasant, and answered a lot of our menu questions. No complaints there. Food came out fast and was tasty. Nothing special, but what you would expect for a burger and wings at a sports bar. I got a burger and cheese fries, and my husband got hot wings. He thought they were pretty average wings. 

It was really crowded and we waited almost a half hour for a table, but if you're there to watch the game then the atmosphere was worth it. They're also always short on parking when there's a full house and we have to park in the extended stay lot. We always go back, as its about 30 seconds from where we live, but this location is nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"The ambiance and food are very good. Been to other places before but this definitely beats all the other places hands down (other than the original one on the strip). Was there at night and the combo with IC Light Man can and Burger for under $10 that was a little unbelievable. This is not food for faint heart. They add generous portions of fries and cole slaw which are deliciously dripping as you savor them."}
{"text":"We were told this was a must while in Pittsburgh. I got the pitsburger and it was pretty bad. Clearly a cheap frozen party with out any flavor at all. The rest of the sandwich, while creative, did not make up for the low quality meat"}
{"text":"Love this place , finally got there last weekend after years of hearing about it and seeing it on tv and it did not disappoint from the atmosphere to the food , it's in a real cool part of town the restaurant as a real cool atmosphere the sandwiches are delicious and different from any other, the place is a great Pittsburgh experience gives you the Pittsburgh feel!"}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh tradition since 1975.  You can't completely understand Pittsburgh unless you visit Primanti's.    I wouldn't here all the time, but every so often I get the craving.  It's a unique dining experience, and they don't try to be exactly like everyone else, that's what makes eating here so charming.  The food is fresh and it's sandwiches you can't always get other places."}
{"text":"Only had this once but was an okay experience. I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong sandwich but I was left with a meh experience. I like the ambiance and the dressed up tots they offered"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome. Had an amazing sandwich and great service. The locals here were so nice. The area is great. We are from albuquerque and the people in pittsburgh have been great. This restaurant/bar rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"C'mon....there are absolutely NO words needed Joe is there a bad thing (well, it's all bad....but SOO good) to eat in this place! It's the original location. You MUST EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwiches are sooooooooooooooo good AND it has fries on it.  It's huge and horrible for you, but you'll love it."}
{"text":"Over-valued sandwiches! The meat tasted like canned meat....  the bread is plain white and ohhhh the French fries literally the worst I have had in my life! I would never come back. I did not get the magic of spending 30 minutes on line for this....."}
{"text":"I had the Cajun chicken sandwich in the classic Primanti style. While it was good, it fell well short of the hype. I had expected the mayonnaise component of the Cole slaw to keep the sandwich from drying out. Unfortunately, their slaw is almost all cabbage, so it only added to the dryness.

The bread also seemed needlessly thick and took over the entire sandwich at times. I wonder if a modernized version of this classic could build on the elements that work -- great chicken, great fries -- and take it to the next level.

Even some BBQ or dijonnaise on top could do wonders for this sandwich."}
{"text":"you sorta have to go here if you're in pittburgh.  i got the pastrami with cheese.  it's quite good."}
{"text":"Mandatory stop when in the Burgh.  I've tried most of the menu over the years but stick with the capicola now.  Great sandwich."}
{"text":"I guess since I'm not from Pittsburgh that's one of the reasons why this place is getting a bad review. We walked in and it just felt dirty, like it hasn't been cleaned some the place has opened. It was hectic and chaotic and people were just yelling at the waiting parties to get seated. When we finally got seated, we were asked what we want to drink and that was it. No menu, no explanation of the different sandwiches, nothing. Not very \"first timer friendly\" We ended up ordering and didn't even finish the sandwich it was that bad. They should really get more variety to the menu, not everyone eats coleslaw and fries on their sandwich."}
{"text":"The location of this Primanti's is hip and fun in Market Sq., Pittsburgh. There is both indoor and alfresco options available. The menu is limited to a dozen or so signature sandwiches, and their larger meatier cousins. There are a variety of drinks available as well. Overall it's a solid pick when in the burg for a meal that you'll not finish."}
{"text":"To be initiated into Pittsburgh, you have to go to Primanti's.  Sandwiches are a tradition and are the best anywhere.  You either have to go to the Market Square location or the Strip location..."}
{"text":"So, yeah, the sandwich is 3 inches tall and has fries in it.  You've got a problem with that?  This puppy tasted better and better with every bite just as it was disintegrating in my hands.  The beer was cheap and plentiful and service was just fantastic.  It's not a gastro-pub,  for sure, but if you expected it to be, then.. come on now..."}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh tradition that began in the Strip District.  Now that they have 17 stores, it's hard to keep the same kind of hometown appeal and character, but I feel that they do this reasonably well (without becoming too much of a chain).  The Moon location is managed fairly well, and the service is quite good.  My fries were very greasy, but I suppose some people like them like that.  The portion size is huge.

I was excited to find out Primanti's has a new vegetarian option, the Spicy Southwest Black Bean Burger.  It's pretty good, with a little bit heat and a delicious flavor.  But it shows Primanti's is keeping up with the times without sacrificing what they do best.

Don't expect to get the same ambiance of the original location, but this location is still pretty good."}
{"text":"Ate two of these bad boys in one sitting :) We had been working all day and needed a charge. Came here on a recommendation and happy we did. 

By the time we left Pittsburgh I had the following sandwiches.

Ranked in order:
1. Capicola - w/ egg
2. Pastrami
3. Angus Steak
4. Bologna 

These are only based on the ones I tried. I honestly can say enough about the Capicola with the egg on it. I just left Pittsburgh today and am already craving this place! 

The bread, the slaw and the fries on these sandwiches are an absolute flavor Mecca. 

The service was top notch too! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Primanti's for literally my entire life. My mother grew up in the Pittsburgh area, and is fond of recounting the time her aunt took her to the original location on Penn Ave. Her mother pitched a fit because back then, it was \"not a good area\". And...that's the whole story, actually. I guess you could call it more of an anecdote...

This weekend, I was in town with my parents and my brother, scouting out apartments in the city. One thing we could all agree on (a rare feat indeed): a stop at this famous spot was a must. After walking around in the steamy hot weather, our stomachs ravenously insisting on a rather-late lunch, we finally rolled into the location at Pitt around 2.30.

It was perfect. No one was there. Two of us got cheesesteaks (weirdly, they use patties instead of shaved steak), and two of us got pastrami with provolone (YES!). I've always particularly liked weird items on sandwiches, and fries and coleslaw would certainly fit that bill for some people. But really, it's an excellent combination. Their slaw isn't gloppy and heavy: it's dressed in a zesty, peppery vinaigrette, not a speck of mayo to be found (which is exactly how I like it). Their fries aren't greasy or overly salty: hot and crispy, they're a perfect complement to the cool, tangy taste of the slaw.  

The prices are reasonable. Considering you get your fries IN the sandwich, and the priciest selection tops out at around $7, it's plenty of food for your buck. Plus, as my dad remarked, \"Half a sandwich is honestly plenty\". However, we did all end up stuffing down the rest, because a good sandwich is always worth the ensuing food coma.  

I can guarantee I will be making a return visit."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out on my first trip to PA. A coworker described the sandwiches as \"unique\". Right up my alley. We went in on a Tuesday night after a long day of meetings and driving. Great beer selection and all types of delicious menu items. I went for the Cappicola Salami with extra meat and an egg. Why not? Beer, salami and an egg...  The filling part of the sandwich was great but the bread was not up to par for me. Bread makes the sandwich. It can also kill a sandwich. Dry bread that was sort of Texas toasty. 4 stars for a cool atmosphere and great sandwich fillings and a beer menu. I will try again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Super-sized Italian-style deli sandwiches at super-reasonable prices. You can't go wrong with just about anything, provided you're not vegetarian or vegan, in which case you'll probably have to stick with salads. The New Yorker (pastrami, corned beef, swiss, spicy mustard) and the Capone (capicola, salami, Italian sausage, provolone) are solid bets, and don't say you weren't warned when you're ordering these \"tall boys.\" They mean it. 

If you're out with a group, more gluttony is in order, whether it means ordering tons of loaded tots or some of their wings, tenders, fried pickles, or mozzarella wedges. Simply a classic Pittsburgh experience all around, especially at this particularly boisterous downtown location."}
{"text":"We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp, hoping to get a real taste of Pittsburgh. What I ordered was a sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat, cole slaw, and mediocre fries, on white bread. The sandwich was very small, but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway, and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.

I was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King. Luckily we had a nice lunch at Salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths."}
{"text":"I sincerely make an effort to try local favorites while I'm traveling and I've heard a lot of hype about Primanti's. Let me just say, for the record, carb on carb action is not really my thing. Frankly, french fries and sandwiches aren't really my thing. So together it was definitely scary. 

I sat at the bar for a late lunch. The staff was fine but mostly disengaged. I had an order of wings with the garlic parmesan sauce and a pittsburger (get it?) with an added egg. The wings were actually pretty good. I liked the sauce and it was fun to try something totally different compared to regular wing sauce. They had many other options of sauces that I would consider returning for. 

When the sandwich came out I could barely see the meat as it was overwhelmed by coleslaw and fries. Once I'd scraped off half of each of those to make it more mouth acceptable I noticed that the meat was pretty small compared to everything else going on here. And that it bore a concerning resemblance to a mcdonald's 'meat' patty. Hmm...

Frankly, even if I liked french fries or sandwiches I don't think I would have liked this rendition. The french fries were, weirdly, simultaneously soggy but also a little undercooked. The patty was gross. I ended up leaving much of this behind. I even tried to drown it in ketchup but it still left me feeling kind of gross. The rest of the day I felt a little queasy. Not really a good experience."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something...if you are in Pittsburgh and want to hit some of the local flavor then this is the SPOT. A native recommended this place to me and I'm glad he did.  I had the number 1 and the number 2 seller (as indicated by the menu) and, believe me, neither were disappointing. I'll start by describing the number 2 selling item and meanwhile I'll let you guess what the number 1 seller is (it's pretty obvious and I'm surprised I had to ask).  Anyway, the number 2 selling item is their cheese steak sandwich...but this is no ordinary cheese steak. It is PILED HIGH with meat, cheese, french fries (on the sandwich), a large slice of tomato, and coleslaw. Sound strange? ITS NOT...it is delicious and please keep in mind that I don't typically allow myself to eat  things that are as big as my face BUT this is absolutely WORTH IT!!!  

TIP: I should have read the fine print and ordered my sandwich with onions (available by request).

So...have you guessed what their number one selling item is? BEER...Iron City Beer to be exact. Good stuff and it compliments the massive sandwich very well.  Get it."}
{"text":"First time here but definitely not my last. Next time i am in Pittsburg i will be back.
Amazing fish sandwich where the fish fillet overhangs both end of the bread it is on."}
{"text":"One of a number of local sandwich chains in the 'burgh. Most well-known for their sandwiches being stuffed with fries and coleslaw (they're quite well-known for it). You can't really go wrong with picking any sandwich off the menu. Tots, fries, and sides are run of the mill. Sandwich portion sizes are rather large and extremely filling so take note of that when you place your order. As for quality, I find their sandwiches to be rather average and have tasted better ones elsewhere. Though the meal itself is rather filling, the quality of meats they use really leave something to be desired. Have tasted better sandwiches at other places (try Peppi's in the North Side; you won't be disappointed!)."}
{"text":"yes. that is all i have to say. the answer is yes.

the customer service at this location is especially excellent."}
{"text":"five stars for the food and atmosphere; three for the service.

don't feel guilty about ordering a bacon sandwich. just do it and relax knowing you've just made the best decision of your life. 

we waited almost an hour for our food. so, bring good company. also, make sure to request to sit outdoors because it's super pretty!"}
{"text":"Came here right after a long night of drinking... I guess that's not the best idea to rate food by since drinking then eating makes things taste a tad better. With everything they had in this sandwich, I would be too scared to eat it sober =P 
We ordered their corned beef & cheese- topped with french fries, coleslaw and tomatoes. Onion on request.
Their corned beef was tender, but I can't say it was the best tasting, but good. The fries were fresh and surprisingly not salty and the coleslaw was good. The combination all in a sandwich--perfect. Now after a long day or long night, this should be the way to finish off the night. Very filling and satisfying.
24 hours makes it even better =)"}
{"text":"I'm new to the city and this is one place that everyone keeps recommending.  It is well-known even outside of Pittsburgh ... thanks to word of mouth and Man vs. Food.  So when we walked in just before noon on a Wednesday I expected to find the place packed, but there was plenty of seating available.

We sat down and discussed our options, eventually deciding to split the Pastrami & Cheese and a Yeungling.  The lady that took our order was a little surly, which was fun to a newbie as she seemed to add to the atmosphere of the place.

Our sandwich?  Let's just say I was a little pissed off at myself for agreeing to share one.  The bread was so soft and wonderful, but my favorite part was the pairing of the pastrami with the fries.  What a perfect combination!  The cole slaw added freshness and crunch without overpowering the other flavors and there was nothing greasy about this sandwich.  Pure health food, hehe ;p

So yes, it would appear that I love Primanti Brothers.  I'm already agonizing over which sandwich to try next!"}
{"text":"This place just isn't that great, highly hyped. 

My girlfriend and I both got the Pittsburgher, it's just frankly a flavorless sandwich. We were with a big group and no one else seemed to love what they got either. If you go, definitely don't get the Pittsburgher, but I'd avoid going period. The food wasn't even hot. 

On a positive note, the service was good."}
{"text":"Just like New York pizza, Boston chowder, Philly hoagies, and Chicago dogs, you have not truly experienced Pittsburgh until you've had a Primanti's Bros. sandwich. The only difference is... the \"must-eats\" of named cities are actually top-notch, and Primanti's Bros. is just... okay.

The whole experience was underwhelming. I came to the original Strip District location expecting the best, and ordered a Corned Beef & Cheese. This place is over-hyped because:

1) The sandwiches are not as big as you've imagined. They are high because of the volume of the bread and fries. In reality, there isn't much meat. We ordered 1 sandwich to share between the two of us expecting a lot of food... but I could have easily finished it by myself.

2) The meat and fries are bland. All you taste when you bite into it is the acidity of the vinegar-based slaw. I'll admit that the slaw is delicious, but that should not be the highlight!

3) Service is friendly. I expected rough around the edges, blue-collared, no-nonsense attitudes, but I forgot this isn't New York.

Overall, happy to check it off my list, but probably don't need to come back to Primanti Bros, or Pittsburgh in general, ever again."}
{"text":"I always go here after I get my tattoos from down the street at Big Iron Tattoo. Every time I have great service and great food. Always a good time."}
{"text":"I would give 2.5 stars if that was a choice. It's just \"meh\". For all the hype I didn't find the sandwiches or the quality of food that impressive."}
{"text":"Since moving last year, this original Primanti's location is now the closest to our house and there are no complaints here about that. I have been to a handful of the other Primanti's locations around the city and this one is by far the best, with Oakland's location coming in at a close second. The sandwiches are perfect every time - fresh bread, crunchy slaw, melted cheese, hot fries, and quality meats. We have never had to wait for a seat at this location or had a negative experience here and everything is made fresh right in front of us. Favorites are the capicola and egg, cheese steak and egg, colossal fish, corned beef and egg, and fried pickles. Fast and friendly service with giant and amazing sandwiches - why wouldn't we keep coming back? If you are in the area or have never experienced Primantis - this is your go to location!"}
{"text":"I'm glad that I came here to finish off my trip to Pittsburgh but Primanti Bros didn't really live up to the hype. I went with the #2 favorite Pittsburger (still couldn't find the #1 favorite anywhere on the menu) and it was solid. To be honest I was expecting more but it was not a bad sandwich. The coleslaw they use tasted like there was too much vinegar which kind of threw me off; I guess I'm used to southern slaw after going to school in Richmond for 4 years. Also, although the fries were good and looked great when they are put in front of you they definitely tasted undercooked and were kind of soggy. The bread was also just regular thick white bread and nothing special, while the burger patty was definitely no Kobe beef. I think the hype of the place makes everything taste better than it really is. If it wasn't so famous they probably would be just another hole in the wall.  Oh yea, Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Capicola with cheese, with a fried egg. I always get it and I'm always happy. Along with two LARGE beers."}
{"text":"Just go to Central Diner. You won't regret it. Seriously why are you still reading this. Are you still thinking about going to Primanti Brothers. You should be at Central Diner by now. The food is only a little bit more expensive, there is way more of it and it's way higher quality. Please just go."}
{"text":"Service is bad. Pizza was bad. Dirty tables. Dirty dirty dirty. Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"All I can say is be prepared to leave stuffed!!! The sandwiches are huge! All of their sandwiches come with slaw and fries on it serve between two slices of Italian bread. I chose fish, which was real tasty. When the sandwich comes to the table it doesn't come on a plate. It comes on a couple pieces of wax paper. You all ready know it's about to go down. Everything about the sandwiches was amazing! I enjoyed every bite. I also enjoyed a very tasty Kentucky Mule. 

Primanti Bros was pretty busy when I was there but the service was actually quite fast. I definitely recommend a trip to Primanti Bros next time you're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We had asked a few friends for recommendations in Pittsburgh and heard this name multiple times, so we decided to give it a try on a pit-stop to Cleveland. 

I'm not sure what all the hype is about. It's a sandwich with french fries in it. The fries were average. I liked the soft white bread. The pastrami and corned beef were what you'd expect. I'm not too big a fan of either types of meat. The cole slaw was just meh, too. 

My one girl friend warned me and she said we should try Pamela's diner instead, which is just a skip away in the Strip District. Next time, fo' sho' cuz I'm not going back to Primanti Bros. 

NOTE: This place is cash only and affordable."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this place never was. I guess I'm not your typical pittsburgher but someone told me hey they have this pizza night it's cheap. Well i have a family of six so you just said the magic word. I was kind of worried because i thought hey 22$ it must be like little Cesars. Boy was i wrong got a warm welcome entering which gave me hope. Sat down and ordered the pizza feast. Which came with a large pizza a family salad that could be refiled for free. Also for a couple bucks more came with wings. And of course a 2 litter or soda. For 22$. The pizza was amazing loads of cheese. You can pick up to 3 toppings which we got extra cheese and didn't have to pay double like most places. Pep and mushrooms the mushrooms could of been bigger. They were like shaved pieces. But it was good i didn't really care. The wings were amazing i got the honey bbq. For 22$ you get a lot of food for your buck."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is famous? That's really the only reason we went to this place. I didn't really get a good vibe from this place. It's definitely an extremely casual place to eat at. The place was separated into two sections. Since the main floor and bar was taken, we sat at the back on the next room where they had the full drink bar. That was a mistake, the place reeked! There was trash all over the place. It seemed like we just came in right after they had a big rush of people, which is still not an excuse to have such a filthy environment. This is definitely not the place for germaphobes! Especially since they just serve your food on plain wrappers. 

Okay, okay, aside from nit picking about the cleanliness, the food was pretty amazing! I had their jumbo fish sandwich and trust me, they do not kid around when they say jumbo. It was huge! Not to mention, everything on their board menu was affordable.

I wish I could say I had the same amazing review about their staff. The lady was just rude and slapped everything so quickly and spoke too quickly too. She seemed like she did not want to serve us at all. She didn't even give us our ticket so we could pay for our meals. We had to tell the cashier to ring us up. The cashier/bar person was pretty nice though. She had a heavy accent but tried to tell us about when the merchandiser guy would be coming by to sell t-shirts and stuff, since we had asked her about purchasing some as souvenirs. Just hope that the next visit here would be better. 

Oh but I would say that you have to definitely try out a Primanti Brother restaurant at least once! It's a whole different world!"}
{"text":"I've never been as enchanted with Primanti bros as the average Pittsburgher.  The food is fine, and it's great that some locations are open 24 hours for food in a pinch."}
{"text":"My dad & I were in Pittsburgh for the weekend (8/4-8/6). We were recommended to Primanti Bros by a friend on Facebook. We decided to go on Saturday afternoon before the Pirates game. Food is very good. Sandwiches are very unique with the fries in the middle of the sandwich. It is pretty cheap, too. It was so good that we decided to go back Sunday after the Pirates game."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a day and had to stop by Primanti Bros since it was on every \"places to visit in Pittsburgh\" list that I saw. The chain restaurant is known for the hearty sandwiches stuffed with fries and coleslaw. I ordered a Pitts-burger (one of their many sandwiches stuffed with fries and coleslaw) and I was not disappointed by all the hype around the restaurant.

Note to non-Pitttsburgh natives: the menu at Primanti Bros claims that the Pitts-burger is the #2 best seller. This is an inside joke regarding Iron City Beer being the #1 seller. (So don't get confused like I did and search the menu for a ridiculous amount of time looking for the #1 best seller that did not exist.)

The service at the restaurant was great but a little slow."}
{"text":"It's Primanti's. It's a gem. A Pittsburgh legend. You're visiting from out of town? Then Primanti's you MUST go.

Normally, I hit up the Southside location to get my primanti's fix, but I was in the strip and we wanted something filling and cheap, so we came here. I got the turkey sandwich with a fried egg and my boyfriend got the steak. We both adored them, as we always do. The amount of food you get for the amount of money you pay, is insane. The bread is so fresh and everything is ALWAYS tasty. Plus, the staff is friendly and that's always a bonus.

If you haven't always tried Primanti's, then you must. There really isn't another choice."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is a must for tourists.  As a local, it's not a top destination, but it's certainly fun to bring out of town guests for the experience."}
{"text":"Luckily living close to this location, it's one of our favorite stops! I've never had a bad thing here as far as food is concerned. The colossal fish, cheese-steak, corned beef and egg, smallman street fries and fried pickles are some favorites! Sandwiches here are great every time with one exception of a colossal fish that was more deep fried breading than fish and had been clearly sitting under a heat lamp too long; but normally this is not the case. 

The only reason I have to give this particular location of Primanti brother's 4 out of 5 stars is the service. It is often hit or miss with this place. The reason we like Primanti's is that it can be a quick place to grab a bite to eat and not somewhere where you wait endlessly for your meal. We almost always sit at the \"seat yourself\" bar area and are usually greeted by a waitress right away. However, sometimes once seated it can take us 30-45 minutes to eat or up to 2 hours for a party of TWO to eat and get out of there. It really just depends on the day for whatever reason. The waitresses are never rude, however everything just can be VERY slow and sometimes I have been there for dinner, had to wait and never had my drink re-filled unless I asked several times. This is a pet peeve for me. 

If you are in Pittsburgh, it's definitely worth a trip, but just be sure you're not in a hurry..."}
{"text":"Deliciousness is the pastrami sandwich+fries. 2.5 day Pittsburgh visit but came here twice cause we just couldn't get enough."}
{"text":"Free Wi-Fi, whaaat? Seems so rare around here. Anyhow..

We came here based on the recommendation of friends, my boss (a native), and the fact that it was featured on Food Network a few times. The place is pretty small and cramped, with seating available upstairs or downstairs. They don't give you a menu here -- instead, there are two identical menus hanging above the kitchen area with a font size big enough to be readable from any seat in the house.

Every sandwich is piled high with the meat of your choice and stuffed with cole slaw, tomatoes, and fries. Yup, fries. The beau loved this idea because that's what he does for all his burgers anyway and saved him the effort. He ordered their #2 best seller, the PITTS-BURGHER CHEESE STEAK. Though he enjoyed his sandwich, he did mention that it wasn't very.. cheese steak-y, but was still good in its own right. I got full after half of my roast beef so I offered my other half to him and he SCARFED that down. He didn't even like roast beef until that night. Good job, Primanti Bros! The other guys finished off their sammies, too. Btw, what is their #1 best seller? Why.. beer, of course! $2 Yuengling on draft? Oh hell, yeah!

It seems like this restaurant is either a big hit or just okay. Half of our party loved it, while I was in the other half and found it alright and probably wouldn't come back if given the choice. The food was mediocre, in my opinion, but it does have a cool atmosphere about it and the beer is cheap. The restaurant was incredibly dirty, with bits of squished food all over the floor. If I was a native, I'd probably brush it off (since I'd expect it), but being an out-of-towner, I wasn't impressed and was actually put off by it.

FYI, Oakland is college town (home of a handful of schools within walking distance - e.g. Carnegie Mellon, University of PA, etc), so the beer is plentiful and there's plenty of eye candy for you fellas!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! I felt like I was an inconvenience.  Staff is lazy, doesn't acknowledge customers- no eye contact.  It's a shame, it's an Pittsburgh institution."}
{"text":"What a let down.

My corned beef was great, but the taste was drowned out by the crappy French fries that were soggy and had zero flavor.  The slaw was good, but I left the bread and fries untouched on the sheet of wax paper because it was all so unnecessary.  Good for people watching, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Do you like to rub elbows with tourists, drunk and/or obnoxious college kids?  All in a divey kind of place?  Think fries should be in its own food group?  Perfect, you're in luck because Primanti Brothers nicely fits the bill.  I give them credit, Primanti's sandwiches have become synonymous with Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh fare.  They've done a great job promoting their little empire of eateries.  

Unless you grew up in a cave, you know the components:  your choice of meat/cheese with a layer of vinegary cole slaw and handful of fries between two generous slices of Mancini's Italian bread.

The sandwiches are OK, and they are not inexpensive, most are about seven dollars.  The slaw and fries make up over half the filling, and the bread gets soggy.  Service is consistently gruff/brusque.  I'm sorry you work in a dive, working the line and putting handfuls of slaw on sandwiches, but don't take it out on me.

If you are coming in from out of town and want a great Pittsburgh sandwich, I would not recommend Primanti's.  Go to Tessaro's or the Smallman Street Deli or the Thin Man Sandwich.  Less hype and much better sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've ever eaten at in my entire life. It is dirty, lacking customer service & the food is not good. I could have gotten a better burger at mcdonalds and 5 of them for the same price."}
{"text":"A sandwich with French fries? Now that's what I call a good meal. I got the Cajun chicken sandwich and it was delicious! It was the best coleslaw I've had. I can't wait to visit again to try their other sandwiches!

The service was not the best, but it also was very busy. The lady that took our order had to come back three times to confirm and still ended up giving us the wrong food and forgot our drinks."}
{"text":"i guess if you are in Pittsburgh and you want to do Pittsburgh things you have to grab a Primanti Bros sandwich but it isn't that good of a sandwich. Pittsburgh is loaded with great places to eat.  you can certainly do better.  having said that, i  totally get grabbing a Primanti Bros if you are in Pitt."}
{"text":"Visited on Sunday around 6:00 pm- my friends & I sat at the bar, it wasn't crowded at all. They had decent drafts- I went with an amber ale. I ordered the ham & cheese sandwich & the rest of my party (5 of us all together) ordered theirs as well. We probably waited 10-12 minutes max for our food-impressive. The sandwich is very good-soft white bread, ham & cheese, delicious fries & their signature slaw. The slaw is not mayo based, it's light & very thin which I like. The fries are really good- I usually take some off of the sandwich & eat them by itself.  Although Primanti's is good- it's never something that I crave. Being that I'm from Pittsburgh, Primanti's is supposed to be the holy grail of food in our town. To me, it's not. Primanti's is definitely good and I haven't had a bad experience there- but personally, I never crave it and I never go out of my way to eat there. This particular location is the main one that I visit when I do- being that it's in Southside & a good place to load up on food before a night out. If you haven't been here, you should try it. It's a Pittsburgh favorite, so it's worth visiting."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my recent visit. I called around 4:00 pm on a Saturday to order the cheese steak sandwich. I was told it would take about 15 minutes. I arrived around 4:20 pm and was told to take a seat at the bar while I waited for the sandwich. By 5:00 pm, my order still wasn't ready and the employees were gossiping in the corner while I waited. I was on a time crunch, so I had to leave empty-handed and hungry. Extremely disappointed, as this is not the experience we typically have with Primanti's. Considering there are two other locations in a reasonable distance from my house, I won't chance it by coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I have eaten my whole life at primantis in the strip and in harmerville. If your from pittsburgh there is no reason for me to try and convince you that this is the best sandwich. If your not a yinzer your in for a shock.  Fries and coleslaw might scare you but welcome to the steel city.  If you get your egg on it then you deserve a firm hand shake accompanied by an ice cold yuingling. Not sure what to get?  Go with the pittsburger you will not be disappointed. 
To prove how good these sandwiches are. . . I was downtown and on my way out I stopped in market square for a delicious pittsburgh. On my way home after eating the first one I pulled off in harmerville and slammed another one of those babies.  Best day of my life!"}
{"text":"Great place to have fun and eat delicious food. The servers and management staff are top notch!"}
{"text":"oh primanti's, you always disappoint! how can so much food bear so little taste? despite a brilliant premise (put all your edibles in the sandwich, leave your other hand free for the potables) the execution leaves much to be desired.

1. these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly. they are always greasy on the outside, raw and mealy on the inside. don't think that just because they're INSIDE the sandwich doesn't mean you can get away with crappy fries.

2. the bread. what the heck dudes? if you're going to put 3 lbs of ingredients in the sandwich, try to use a bread that doesn't immediately turn into insipid play-doh in your hands.

I like disgusting junk food as much as anyone (see my rave review of the O), but I wish the primanti's goons would put a little bit more effort into their sandwiches. seriously guys -- take some pride in your work and make something good for once. and check the thermostat on your fryolator already!"}
{"text":"Great place for cold beer and tremendous pirmanti sandwiches!  The place is always packed. Be prepared to circle the lot for parking.  They can seat 200 but have pArking for 50 at the most.   Everyone here strives to please. No ball busting needed."}
{"text":"There were French fries on my sandwich!
This is my first time in PA, so I wasnt sure what to expect when we were sent to Market Square for \"the greatest sandwich in the world!\"

The prices were dead on - about 6$ for a sandwich and 1.5$ for a tea.  I split a ham and cheese with my friend and we both left full.  I had the cole slaw (which was more like sauerkraut) and it was yummy.

I am docking them a star because the service was less than desirable, even after the lunch rush ended."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place after seeing it on tv many times...I finally made it to the strip talked some friends into going and we were totally disappointed. We all got the # 2 special...and all you could taste was vinegar....the guy who took my order was very rude...explained this is our first time and from out of state....I would have got up and walked out however didn't want to make a scene since I was with friends. I only ate a little asked for a togo bag...ended up throwing it in their dumpster in lot......I do not reccomend for any one to waste their time or money...."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know.  Reviewing Primanti Bros is an easy shot!  How can you mess up pizza, beer, and those unique sandwiches?  Well, you can't, at least here!

I was in Monroeville, PA, and there's a Primanti Bros. nearby, so I had to go!  I had their famous Black Angus Sirloin Steak Sandwich and a Sam Adams Alpine Springs brew.  The sandwich was very good, but what makes it good is the cole slaw.  The meat was just ok. the provolone was there (I think...), the tomatoes were good and of course the fries were there and added that strange combination texture that tastes great!  But it's that very-vinegary cole slaw that is addicting!  Put it all on thick, Italian bread, and you've got a messy sandwich that shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"I've been busy with classes, but that's all done for a few weeks. I've been doing some traveling, and I want to get some pictures up about some of the food I had outside of Philadelphia. When I get back to Pittsburgh, I always make an attempt to eat at Primanti Brothers. These sandwhichs are delicious, and impossible to imitate. They stack griddle cooked meats, prefectly seasoned cole-slaw, and fries on squishy white bread in a heavenly combination. The sandwhiches are whipped out on pieces of wax paper and the whole atmoshpere of the place is quick and gruff; get in, eat, and out.

I was out with my good friend Callen and we split two different sandwiches, the pastrami and the capicola. Both were excellent, but I prefer the pastrami, which in my mind, is the best and most classic sandwich they serve. There's actually a lot of options on the menu, but stick to the sandwhiches.

I love this place, its a Pittsburgh institution, and I recommend everyone to hit it up when your in Pittsburgh, and regularly if you live there."}
{"text":"Not the original, but just as good.  Service is a bit better here, and the food is just as good.  Big bar in the front with tons of TVs.  Bunch of lower quality (but cheap) beers  on tap, you can smoke in the front room.  

When it's crowded, head straight for the back bar, nab a stool there, and watch them churn out hundreds of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Trying the well-known Pitts-burger at the original Primanti Bros. location. The Pitts-burger consists of a ground beef patty topped with fries, coleslaw with Italian dressing, and a slice or so of tomato. The sandwich comes wrapped in wax paper.

It was actually pretty good, the taste of burger meat and fries went well together, the flavor of the coleslaw stood out.

I would eat a Pitts-burger again.

I don't recommend this location, while there is plenty of tables on both sides, and two countertops with stools to sit at, it looks a bit like a rundown diner with dirty floors."}
{"text":"If this isn't a true yinzer sandwich, I'm not sure what is. Two slices of thick, soft Italian bread, your choice of meat and cheese, a heaping portion of coleslaw, and a fistful of French fries layered right in. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"I would say this place was not bad. If the line is longer then 20 mins don't bother. I had the pastrami sandwich and have to say it was good but I have had better.  Like many others wrote I am not a big fan of coldslaw on my sandwich.  This place definetly does have charqcter , it takes you back.  I think to be able to say I have tried it go, but I don't think I would really go back unless I was going with someone who has never been."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place. Not only is the service friendly but the food is awesome. 
It's my first time here and I'm here for the weekend with a friend and it's a great spot by Pitts university. 
I highly recommend stopping by for a meal. 
Be hungry though because it's a lot. 
Thanks for a great first experience Primanti Bros 

Fraternally, 
Dave from Chicago"}
{"text":"best turkey sandwich ever!!!! 
who would think fries n coleslaw on a sandwich would kick @ss."}
{"text":"On a vacation in Pittsburgh and we'd been recommended this spot by a few people. Got there at about noon, there were about twenty people in the line for seating. We were doing take out and were directed straight to the cash register

The place: decorated like a regular bar/restaurant with some cool art work and a meal of famous Pittsburgh(ers?)

Staff: The service was top notch. Everyone in the staff was super friendly and courteous

Food: unfortunately, worst part of the experience. We got a Pittsburgher, a capicola and a pastrami sandwich. The opinion from all three of us was that the whole thing needed a bit more spices and salt. My capicola was supposed to be spicy but it was just totally bland. Overall it's just tasted like some cheap deli sandwich and not something that should be putting Pittsburgh on the sandwich map"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are large and even include the fries INSIDE it! Not usually a fan of coleslaw, but theirs is quite good. Not overwhelming in flavor, just enough to make it a unique addition to the sandwiches. Don't be surprised when you get the sandwich and there's no plate that comes with it. Worth a stop when you get a chance!"}
{"text":"I was recommended here by a friend as a place to cross off the Pittsburgh \"bucket list\". I ended up getting the Pittsburger - it met my expectations, which was above average to begin with. I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Disappointingly mediocre. Ordered to go with a party and ate at the hotel a block away. The famous hot sandwich was cold and bland. Cole slaw bland. Fries soggy and limp. Burger was uninspired. Similar reactions from others in our party. 

Waited with two others in our party at the bar for 20 min at bar for a drink while we waited for our food before finally giving up. This is a franchise, so some may be better than others, but I'd definitely avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"drove 4 hrs from dc to check it out.

a bit overrated if you ask me. went here on a saturday afternoon. the line was almost out the door. we waited in line but didnt know if the line would get us a table. a friend of mine spotted some seats at the counter. she asked the surly woman working there if we could sit there and she said ok. we sit. (the surly woman later yelled at people in line saying \"DO NOT SEAT YOURSELF. THE LINE IS THERE FOR A REASON\" or something like that. she also yelled at patrons to keep the door closed.) the guy behind the counter gives us a look-at-these-f-ing-tourists look and asks us if we know what we want. we order. he doesnt write anything down, and surprise surprise, our order comes out wrong. i wanted slaw and my friend didnt. so that got mixed up. he also handed us the wrong sandwiches and said \"sometimes i mix things up\". yeah, no kidding, and i could tell he didnt give a crap either. i had no desire to even mention the mix up to the server. i just wanted to eat and get the hell out of there. my favorite part was when we asked for the bill and the guy stood and stared while i was trying to figure out the tip. oh and by the way, the sandwich sucked. i got the \"#2 best seller\" which was the cheesesteak sandwich. i wonder if this was a joke. the \"steak\" was like a crappy sausage patty. i added an egg on there, but for what? i dont even know. the sandwich was bland. the fries were meh. i left very bitter.

then, we went back late night. i am a glutton for punishment, and after all, we did drive 4 hrs to check this place out. the nighttime experience was much better. way less people. probably less tourists. we went to the other side of the restaurant and the guys behind the bar were very nice. ordered a kolbassi sandwich. it came out correctly this time. it was very good. much better experience at night. no complaints this time. but really though, this is the 1st time ive been to the same restaurant twice in one day. we got abused at 4pm and treated like humans at midnight. this place obviously has a \"we dont need your business to survive, so we'll treat you however we want\" attitude, and i dont appreciate that."}
{"text":"I'm not from Pittsburgh so when I moved here I was looking for something that was a local staple. This place fits the bill perfectly. Never have I seen slaw and French fried on a sandwich. Maybe one or the other but never both. I love cabbage but cole slaw is not my thing. That being said the steak sandwich with double meat and all the fixings was really good. I'm actually a fan. I did end up taking a bit of the slaw off but thats just personal preference. This is a place I will be visiting again. It's not my Mexican food from home (Phoenix) but its a must have while in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The exact reason why some people don't like this place is precisely why I love it.  1) They put fries and coleslaw on your sandwich.  Awesome.  2) They serve everything with cheese. 3) They have really good beer choices, including their house dark which isn't bad for $2 a pint, which is ridiculous.  

Pittsburgh is not a healthy town.  The salad craze hasn't made it's way here.  And therefore I love it.  Give me a big ass tasty sandwich, with good, cheap beer and you have made me a happy man.  I loved this place.  I'd totally come back when I'm in town next."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Friday afternoon and got and order of the pub pickles and the IC Light beer ($2.50 on Fridays!). Both were great, the pickles were AMAZING! The sandwiches were good, nothing special but have a cool history behind it. It wasn't super crowded and had a nice staff. Would definitely recommend it for the experience."}

{"text":"I was in town for an event at the Warhol museum and had to try a primanti brothers sandwich 

It was a Wednesday night so there were not a ton of people there but I was in love with the place as soon as I saw the neon outside.  

Service was quick friendly and courteous.  Although everything on the menue looked good I opted for the number 2 biggest seller the pittsburger.  The number one biggest seller is beer!!

The sandwich came wrapped in butcher paper.  It was visually appealing    The bread was very fresh Italian bread the Salisbury steak paddy cooked and seasoned well. All sandwiches come with French fries and cole slaw right on the sandwich. This is the tradition and charm of the place and it did not disappoint. 

I will return someday. 

I urge you if you are in Pittsburgh to not pass this place by."}
{"text":"I think I made the mistake of coming here sober. Primanti's is great if you've had a few. Oddly, this location closes at midnight so it's late night food without late night hours.

This location is much smaller than the others. There's no good way to get a group of 8+ people together here.

It's downtown near offices but doesn't seem to suit the after-work get together well. The food is still a decent value but that's about all it has going for it."}
{"text":"Had to try a classic cheesesteak sandwich since it got such great reviews on Yelp. It was tasteless without ketchup and hot sauce and even after adding those, it didn't taste very good. Also, the fries were cold-- bleh! I don't get what the hype is about. Yes it's cheap and filling, but it's also bland."}
{"text":"Went there after seeing them on TV and reading about them in Yelp

I ordered the pitt-burgher
My wife ordered the fish sandwich 

Coffee was hot. - average
Table was a little dirty
The coleslaw was bitter
Fries were made from frozen  below average
Burger pattie was stale 
Bread was nice 


Not worth a repeat visit
McDonalds has better burgers

Still feeling the effects of the bad food. This is now a place to avoid for me"}

I asked the waitress what was the most requested item and she said, \"You're drinking it honey.\" pointing to my Iron City pint.  Which was $2.95 by the way.  God bless the Burgh.  

So the sandwich is as I remember.  Huge, but if you squeeze you can get your mouth around it.  I realized my second time around that there's a reason they can keep prices low.  There's not a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.  It's dwarfed by the coleslaw and the fries.  I'd also pass on the cheesesteak next time.  It was a square beef patty which didn't seem right and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Would get pastrami next time for sure.  

So the sandwich and decor of this location would rate 3 stars, but the concept of a restaurant that serves you an oversized sandwich with coleslaw and fries on it for  around 5 bucks rates 5, so it equals out to 4.  This sandwich and chain are one of the reasons I love the Burgh so much."}
{"text":"Why waste time? Want a sandwich, fries and slaw? Put it all in one, this is what Primati Bro's  does. 

Every sandwich here is huge, not really due to the protein, but due to the handful(s) of fried and slaw and the thick bread each one is built with. I opted for the Colossal fish and cheese sandwich (6.99).  The fish had a nice crisp batter, the fires were a bit soggy , the bread was nice and soft and the slaw was decent.  Alone I loved the fish, All together the starch of the bread and fried over power the fish. There was hot sauce at the table to help add flavor (frank's red hot style). 

Seating is odd, seat your self and you will get service when you are noticed. Drink come in to go cups and the menu is on paper for you to keep as notice to you doctor of your  1000+ calorie meal. 

My coworker also got the cheese fires for extra cholesterol and to max his per diem. Cheese wiz smothered soggish fries. It was decent but it did not blow me away by any means.

Bottom line, if you are a tourist, give it a try, if you are a local come for the nostalgic name."}
{"text":"Still the same from the first time I visted 25 years ago

I've been frequenting the place since the time when I lived in Latrobe 25 years.  One of my favorite things to do on Saturday was drive and spend a couple of hours shopping for produce in the Strip District topped off with a stop at Primanti Bros.  This was in the days when this was the only store and the others elsewhere in PA and Florida had not opened yet.  Occassionally I'll hit the one in Harmarville or Greensburg and I have hit the store in Ft. Lauderdale a couple of years ago when I went to the Keys.

In anycase, this is still my favorite.

For those who do not know, The Strip District is a Strip of block alongside the old railroad tracks where the trains arriving with produce would be offloaded. Primanti Bros was established to feed these workers.  

Food is good, Food is simple, Food is quick because these guys did not have long to eat hence putting the french fries on the burger.

Was in town last weekend and decided to give them a try to see if it was as I remembered.

There have been some changes but in the end, it's the same Primanti's.  Had the same burger with french fries on top as I did 25 years ago. Still juicy and cooked perfectly with great flavor.

Service is the same and despite the updates, the atmosphere from the 1930's still prevails.

The rest of the Strip District is changing and not necessarily for the better but Primanti's remains the same."}
{"text":"Adam Richman on Man Vs. Food can make anything look good. That's why we went to Primanti's, so we could try a sandwich piled with meat, slaw, fries on hand sliced bread. My brother-in-law lives in the Iron City and we went back for a visit from Austin this past weekend so we had the golden opportunity to try the sandwich. 

We met at the main location in the Strip District and let him order. That was probably a mistake, because his meat of choice was not what Richman ordered. Rather, we got the steak sandwich, which is funny because it is not really steak, maybe Salisbury steak, but no rib-eye or anything like that. The sandwich was good, but not great. I had them add the fried egg as well, because my arteries needed the additional clogging. 

I think I would have enjoyed the sandwhich more had I ordered the pastrami instead. Oh well, maybe next time. This is the kind of food you should eat only about once or twice a decade anyway."}
{"text":"Love this place no better Pgh sanwich an at... love living in the burgh... a whole bunch of food in between two pieces of mancini's bread... delicious"}
{"text":"I can't believe all of the bad reviews of this place? No one ever said it was the best sandwich ever, or the most delicious. It was created so steel workers could get a filling meal with their limited lunch shift. Backbreaking work requires mondo calories.

Quit the cork sniffing and go there hungry. They excel at feeding you for a low price. If you eat with your pinky in the air, then this is not the place for you.

My family and I appreciate this place and consider it a Pittsburgh institution. As my grandma-in-law says, \"It will sicken you.\" Haha! Despite that, she never seems to have a problem wolfing down her Pitts-burger sandwich and cheese fries."}
{"text":"I am a huge sandwich fan and this place is famous for great sandwiches, so I had to check them out. However, I have to admit was I was thrilled with the idea of French fries on my sandwich, but I have to say me and everyone in my party was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the corned beef and cheese and it was huge, but also was moist and had a lot of flavor.  It was really big, but I made sure to eat it all and I would definitely eat one again if I am ever back in town."}
{"text":"I think the hype here is focused on local tradition, not necessarily the food or service. The sandwich wasn't bad, but I wasn't overly-impressed by any part of the meal. I think I would have enjoyed it more with the fries and slaw on the side. It's also pretty annoying that the bill they place on the table doesn't have any sort of item pricing or total. Makes it difficult to split, too!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the sandwich.  Sandwich and slaw shoved into there.  I'll have to agree with the others here.  It is an acquired taste.  Not blown away.  But I'm glad I got a chance to try it myself."}
{"text":"I grew up stopping at the Primanti Brother's in downtown so this brings back a lot of good memories. We stopped at this one as it was close to our hotel and before we headed downtown for the Indians/Pirates game. I remember the sandwiches being huge as a kid and I'm glad to say they still are! I went with my favorite the Corned Beef and Cheese. It was just as delicious as I remembered, if not better. I'm not a cole slaw fan, but as the waiter told us most people like it on the sandwich and I would agree. It's the perfect salty, vinegar that compliments the meat. My husband got a burger and said it was good, nothing special, but better then he's had a most place. My in-laws both had the chicken sandwich and found it to be good. My father-in-law really liked the cajun sauce that came with it. My brother-in-law had wings and found them to be just as good. 

We later ordered a carry out pizza, wings, and salad from them after the game so my daughter could run around the hotel room. The pizza was quite good with a sweeter sauce, we had honey barbecue wings and I really liked those. I found the fried chicken salad to be a little lacking partly because I don't like blue cheese, but the parts I ate without were good.

Overall definitely a nice spot to stop especially if you are staying out in Moon. I would highly recommend a trip to the downtown location if you're looking to try Primanti Brothers as the atmosphere can't be missed!"}
{"text":"Okay, not the best stuffed sandwich. I ordered a double meat pastrami corned beef sandwich. The meat: barely there, less than 6oz of meat. The fries and slaw were delicious. Cool tourist spot."}
{"text":"Had to try it. In all fairness, maybe we ordered the wrong thing and it was late at night. The sandwich tasted bland, with texture of some kind of ground meat. I thought I would like those fries in between, but it didn't add to the sandwich at all. Just lots of calories. It was a big sandwich. We didn't finish them. My husband loved the beer. He was going nuts without his beer and wine."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are obviously the best .  But this is about the pizza.  Possibly the worst pizza I've ever had.  The chef boyardee build at home kit is better.  The crust is not crusty, and the sauce is just bland crushed tomatoes.  It's flat out gross."}
{"text":"For my 50th review, I figured I'd tackle Primanti's, since it's a PGH classic.  I came here a couple of years ago for lunch around noon, after visiting the Heinz History Center.  Although there was a line, my dining partner and I were able to get seated fairly quickly at the counter.  I ordered the chicken sandwich, and it took awhile to come out, but when it did, it was quite filling, and not half bad.  The bread was soft and thick, the fries and coleslaw were fresh, and the meat was well-grilled.  Sure, the food here is on the blander side taste-wise, but this is to be expected, given that many yinzers don't like their food overly spicy or bursting with strong flavors.  If you come here, don't expect haute cuisine--just some filling and unique sandwiches.

During our visit, an old lady was selling pastries behind the counter, so I bought a lemon one, and it was delicious!  (This isn't part of Primanti's regular offerings, though--she may have been a friend of the owners.)  Service was gruff and perfunctory, and we waited awhile for our sandwiches.  The atmosphere, as others have noticed, is quite divey, but that's part of the appeal of this place.  People-watching opportunities abound.

This is a good place to take out-of-towners for a filling and unique lunch.  Take your guests to dinner at a place such as Cure or Legume, or perhaps an ethnic restaurant, to give them an idea of the range of PGH cuisine.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Service was very good and quick. Food was excellent, prepared perfectly. Great stop for lunch and a beverage. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area. Fries were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love Primanti Bros. sandwiches!  I must enjoy one every time I am back home.  The 3 star rating is NOT because of the food. The service was HORRIBLE. While I understand I was waiting for a friend to arrive (she got stuck in traffic) my serve repetitively walked by me and ignored me.  I wanted to order a beer and a appetizer but I couldn't get her attention. I ended up walking up to the bar to get the attention of the bartender that got me a beer and appetizer. We ended up sitting at the bar instead of returning to table because the bartender was will to take care of us."}
{"text":"This place was the only reason I was looking forward to my business trip out to Pittsburgh.  I heard Ed Rendell make mention of Primanti Brothers when he first became Governor of PA.  Ever since then, I've seen it on Food Network, the Travel Channel, Destination America....I was craving one of these sandwiches just from the description.

Finally, 10 or more years later, I have the need to travel to Pitt. for business.  I started doing my research on Primanti Brothers, their location, which one is the original, what type of meats are in their selection.  I was working up a panic thinking about whether or not I should try the pastrami.  I've never had pastrami, but am not a big fan of corned beef.  I started asking friends what they would do and alot of them said they love pastrami.  They also love corned beef.  What to do, what to do???

As soon as I got off the plane, I headed to the original, in the Strip District.  The mean lady I saw on TV was there.  She made my sandwich!!  Under pressure to hurry and order (not by the staff there, I just had to get on a conference call in 15 minutes) I went for the pastrami.  

When I got the sandwich, quickly, it was picture perfect! I smashed it down and dove in.  The combination of everything was really really good and I was glad I got the pastrami.  It turns out that there's no mayo in the coleslaw, but vinegar and maybe a little oil.  That counteracts the saltiness I was expecting from the pastrami.  The fries didn't seem to be salted either.  God, that was a good sandwich.  Definitely go here and def get the pastrami.  

Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because, well...it's no cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I came here as a pre-game activity for a Thursday night football game, so it was understandably busy.  I came ahead of my party, and the guy who was hosting was kind enough to seat me without them, but the server got pretty annoyed when my friends didn't appear rather quickly.  I ordered a drink and an appetizer to stave him off of giving up my able and shuffling me to the counter, and I totally get the urgency to turn over tables as quickly as possible when a) you work for tips and b) it's a game night.  But come on, if I got seated, then take it up with the person doing the seating!  I could have done without the attitude. Anyway, I got my usual sandwich and it was just fine.  I'm starting to think that the sandwiches really are just average, and the wings and pizza actually *are* a little more impressive, but hey, I only eat a Primanti Bros sandwich a handful of times a year at most, so I always order it regardless.  Anyway, it's awwwwright.  Certainly not bad, but not blowing me away."}
{"text":"Ok. We were going to Indiana to visit kids. Normally take south route. But took northern route to stop by Primanti Bros. See photos. Pretty excited. Got the pastrami sammy. Most ordered. Darn good. I appreciate the slaw fries on it. However, I would skip the fries. Everything else PERFECT!!!  Got the terror tots.Cheesy sauce, japs, bacon, needed scallions. Tasty. Was finished about half way thru. See photo. Gagged rest down. So good. Got the t shirt cuz, well, you know. 
All in all, go. Checked off a bucket list item. BTW Micheal at the bar was fabulous! Attentive, had some great comments about food. And beers! Not pushy and just what you need after  a four hour drive! 
Thx Mike!!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. The cheesesteak was a weird patty instead  of thin steak and thick bread instead of a roll. The bread to everything else ratio was way off. I ended up taking off half the bread. 

The server was rude when I asked for my sandwich without lettuce and tomato. He never returned to our table after delivering our food, so I sat with no tea for half my meal. 

Be warned if you have a baby. The restrooms are down a narrow flight of stairs, small, and have no changing station."}
{"text":"Snuck this place in minutes before heading back to the airport. It's a Pittsburgh classic and deserves to be so. Not my favorite pastrami every, but it's certainly the most interesting one I've had. Great service."}
{"text":"No big deal. They seem to be living off the idea that nobody put French fries on a sandwich before. Not that great actually. Tried it twice....never go back. What does that tell you?"}
{"text":"My favorite Primanti's is still the original. The original is much smaller than the other three locations that I have now been to around town, but the service was unmatched and the food was better. Tough experience to beat. 

We came here after a Penguins game for dinner. It was a short and easy walk from Consol to Market Square if you haven't walked between them before. Feels quite safe too. You'll get what you're expecting here, and it is a great, lively location. We had quick and pleasant  service last night at this Market Square location, but it was quite crowded and they really pack you in. I ordered the pastrami and cheese, and I wish there would have been just a bit more pastrami on it. 

I love that this location is next to many different bars and pubs, and right around the corner from the ice skating rink."}
{"text":"I like the original location better and that's just because the Monroeville location doesn't have milkshakes and was out of a couple of other small necessities (to-go boxes anyone? Service got a slow start but our server ended up being a-ok. I would go here again, I just know not to expect much next time. If you want a treat as you experience Primanti Bros for the first or event 174th time, check out the original location near downtown."}
{"text":"Got a dinner for Cappicola & Cheese ($6.29) it special sandwich with spicy ham, and fries + coleslaw in between the bread. Total include tap beer only less than $10 including tax. what a great DEAL!!"}
{"text":"Third try at Primanti on third trip to Pittsburgh.  Was disappointed with the meager amount of sandwich meat on the first two visits.  Ordered the Capone this time.  The sandwich has sliced Italian meats including a spicy sausage.  The sliced meat is still meager but the spicy sausage adds thickness and extra flavor.  This will be the reason for me to return to Primanti."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We've been here about 15 times and have had only one bad experience.  Their sandwiches are the bomb! My favorites are the capicola and egg, and the pastrami and cheese! Pretty good wings too. I am a Primanti's junkie!"}
{"text":"If it is your first time in PGH do it. Otherwise skip. You need to be drunk to think this is good or feeling very nostalgic. With all the great choices for food in PGH, I wouldn't waste my calories here."}
{"text":"Eh, not exactly what I expected but it was good the less. Not taking credit cards is always odd to me. I guess since I'm from NYC I expect credit cards to be accepted every where but for place that I as crowded as this place I just can't figure it out.

The primanti cheesesteak was nothing that I thought it would be. I was thinking of a dripping oozy Philly wrap but not in this part of town. Not in this part of PA. Although I enjoyed it, I doubt I'll ever take an hr trip from Ohio to it again.

I actually like the decor unlike other Yelpers. I had no idea about all the people who represented Pittsburgh but I left way more aware.

The bathrooms location is crazy, but its all part of the this place is weird type of thing.
Carol and my family seemed to enjoy it, because they were passed out on the drive back to Ohio and you know when something gives you the itus it's a good sign.

It's an experience and an experience is worth three stars."}
{"text":"My first trip to Pittsburgh and all I kept hearing about was this place and the Pitts Burger! WOW! I was not disappointed...there's definitely gonna be a mess after you get done grubbing but that's just the stamp of deliciousness!

The fries & slaw slapped on top of the burger just put it over the top. Great pricing, awesome service (Thanks Jay!!), and cool atmosphere. MUST TRY!!  Tip: If you want the restaurant section and its late go straight back...there's more seating...or go in the side door towards the back."}
{"text":"Still great sandwiches but service has gone down hill in past 3 years. I would recommend going during the week and with a small crowd . The staff seems to become disorganized when there are more than 5 tables to serve."}
{"text":"food was good i got the buffalo chicken flatbread and five boneless wings. appreciated the depth and large size of dipping sauces. seemed pretty busy although i did eat on st patrick's day. the waitress was nice and attentive however the screamo music was uncomforting but they ended up changing it halfway through the meal which was nice. overall good food and good service."}
{"text":"This was amazing. I haven't been back in a long time... but when I was here, It was well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwich joint.  The upstairs loft was a cool place to kind of watch the cooking and the crowd below.  Service was friendly and quick.  They have some unique sandwiches that were very good."}
{"text":"I think the best way to truly experience a city's culture is to partake in their beloved late night spot. I asked my host, the fiery red hot Rachel C on where to go in Steel City and she (begrudgingly) led me to this local haunt. Hey, a girl's got to eat! 

Open 24 hours, Primanti Brothers is a Pittsburgh staple. First things first, cash only. Show yourself to the ATM by the front door. For eight Sacajaweas you can eat like (an obsese) king here! Behold my trans-fat laden heart....this place is awesome!

We opted to share their #2 best selling item on the menu the Pittsburger (apparently beer is their #1 selling menu item) and the roast beef. I didn't get a chance to try the Pittsburger, but it was thoroughly enjoyed my table. The roast beef sandwich was piled mile high with meat, coleslaw, and the crispiest darn tootin' awesome french fries you've ever had. 

I was afraid that the coleslaw would be mayo based (I'm a big anti-mayo supporter) but to my surprise it was vinegar based.

Service was prompt and a bit of sassy. I love you City of Bridges!"}
{"text":"If you're from Pittsburgh, Primanti's goes hand-in-hand with Heinz ketchup and the Mon Incline! The history of Primanti's has always fascinated me as well - the steel workers would put everything plus their sides (fries and coleslaw) on their sandwich to save time at lunch and get back to work. Good thing they did and now we all enjoy it today - whether it be for lunch, dinner, during sporting games, or at 3am after you've been out with your friends! Saturday night after a friends birthday party, we stopped at the one on 18th and Carson in the South Side. This one is more of a counter style location - you're in and out and eating on the sidewalk, in your car, or back at your apartment. There are some tables but not many. Starting at about 1:30am there is a line out the door and down the sidewalk. The cheese fries I had on Saturday night were delicious!"}
{"text":"Go to the original. It worth it. A lot of the servers are really great and have worked there a long time. The place is packed but the original is the one you want to go to. Bring cash - no credit cards!"}
{"text":"Heavy stuff!  we were told it was a must while visiting Pittsburgh. Glad we tried it. David didn't like having everything on his sandwich. It was ok. Just heavy!  we had the Pastrami and cheese and Capicola and cheese."}
{"text":"It was just ok to me. Glad it was open real late the last time. Large portions but after two visits I can think of at least 20 places easily with a better sandwich."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've ever had, obscenely delicious. Recommend the pastrami , much better than the \"2nd best seller\" the steak and cheese which isnt shaved steak, it's more of a patty. Kosher pickles are also a must and since I can't get Yuengling back home, I have to get a 22 oz draft.

Be sure to check out the original down on the strip, it's crowded but worth it."}
{"text":"Great service!!! First time here visiting from Chicago. Had the Pitt-burger sandwich and the roast beef sandwich, both with fries and egg inside. Also had a giant slice of sausage pizza while we waited for $2."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a few years after seeing it on Man vs Food as well as hearing from one of my friends who grew up in Pittsburgh. Many of the students on campus told me that this is the best sandwich ever too. And after trying it, I can see why college students would like it - portion size is off the charts. But it really doesn't taste like much to me.

The appetizers are pretty good though - the loaded tater tots and fries are really flavorful and hot out of the fryer. The fried cheese triangles are really good too if you like fried gobs of mozzarella (and let's be honest, who doesn't?).

But the sandwich? It's an experience to be sure as its a Pittsburgh icon but I think its a one and done thing. Bread is soft italian bread but so soft that it can't hold up to the mass of stuff inside. I got a capicola and egg and the meat was a pretty good amount, but it still dwarfs the contents of the fries and slaw. The slaw is pretty good actually - I don't normally like slaw either. But when you got about 3 inches of fries to go through that are a bit limp and not crisp and unsalted, its really hard to taste the sandwich from top to bottom - you just taste bland fries. A lot of our group couldn't finish their sandwich cause it was just too much for them and I can see why."}
{"text":"I used to love primanti's bros, but I wish the would use fresh pressed ground meat for their burgers instead of frozen patties. It would be SO much better. Just not a fan anymore"}
{"text":"After watching man v food and hearing about the hype I was pretty excited to get my hands on one of these sandwiches. However, when I got the sandwich I was pretty disappointed. The sandwich I got was pretty bland and simple. It was a good sandwich, I just expected more with the hype."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Primatis for many years, but was dying for a taste of Pittsburgh. It is still what I remember and enjoyed every bite. Always a great place for good simple food."}
{"text":"THE MANLY MEAL by Primani Bros.

Proportions satisfy long-distance south-of-border driving hunger.
The portion size MORE than fulfill Two of my other companions.
In this, THE MANLY MEAL($8.99) certainly completes it's purpose.

24oz Iron City Light Man-Can inclusive of the combination. Swweeet.
Coleslaw & Tomato inside makes sure MANLY MAN eat their Veg.
I prefer Capicola ~over~ #2 Best Seller Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak.
Potato Fries inside the Sandwich? Definitely need a flavourful Meat.

Choose your Meat wisely my Friends."}
{"text":"locals seem to either love or hate this place. 

personally i don't feel the need to stop here every time i'm in pittsburgh, but about once a year i get a serious craving.

beyond the novelty factor of it, the sandwiches are good as shit. there's something about the fries and coleslaw and bread that compliment the meat and cheese perfectly.

363 days until i return..."}
{"text":"The quintessential Pittsburgh sandwich, many try to replicate it (looking at you Cleveland), but there's nothing like the real thing. 

Brought guys here from Columbus, Cincinnati and Chicago and everyone agreed it was the perfect late night* sandwich.

{"text":"I don't care for Primanti brothers.  It is overrated.  There are much better sandwiches in the city.

The sandwiches aren't bad, they just aren't great.  I like the fries.  I like the vinegar based cole slaw.  Both are great.  The white bread is fine.  My issue is with the main ingredients.  The main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality.

My other issue is their restaurants are all filthy.  I've been to 4 different Primanti locations and each one just seems greasy.

Better Pittsburgh Sandwich Alternatives:
Fathead's has a sandwich with kielbasa and pierogies.
Wingharts has a burger with fries and cole slaw."}
{"text":"I'd driven up to Pittsburgh with some friends for a punk/rock show. That night we lived it up to some raw quality music . Afterwards, since it was around St. Patrick's day we  cruised the frat parties - stumbling along the Pitt campus, looking for the most obnoxious partying scene to join - cat fights, flashing, and belligerent green painted guys  -all major pluses. 

After finding \"the one\" my friends spent the night attempting to play beer pong with brawny guys. One green beer after another....one high five after another...one spill after another....one \"hey, watch those hands\" after another.....it all came to a finale  - as my friend turned to me - his face matching the color of his beer and nodded. I understood. I grabbed my other friend, and we tripped over cups and half naked girls to the still snow covered ground outside - and painted it with our St. Patrick's day Guinnesses. YUCK. I was done......

The next morning - I was miserable. My friends were already all packed to go, both obviously lacking livers . I was in no such shape. I needed something before I could move, not to mention that all my clothes were ruined from the night before. The guy, who had put us up for the night, also out of laundry - provided some tiny running shorts, and someone  lent me some shoes (even my shoes were in horrible shape).   

\"take these....just go to Primanti's - you'll be fine in a few....\" I didn't care what Primanti's was - I just wanted to die. But my friends nodded. 

\"Yeah jess - get dressed - we're going to go to Primanti's.\"

And so...reluctantly....I put on an absurd outfit in the middle of freezing winter - white legs and all, and climbed into the car to Primanti's.

I kept on complaining, in between nauseousness that everyone would stare at my outfit in the middle of the winter weather. 

\"no Permanti's is cool - they've seen everything.\"  

They weren't messing around - within 20 minutes of a slowly eaten - to die for sandwich topped with french fries, fresh coleslaw, hot sauce, provolone cheese, and amazing thinly sliced turkey and Italian Bread....my stomach had settled and I was able to produce a slight smile.

\"no lie - this is the best sandwich I've had in awhile...I can't even taste the beer anymore.\"

And better yet, no one even flinched as I trudged out in my short shorts and clown shoes. Everyone was too engrossed in their sandwiches and discussing their crazy nights to care. Permanti's really is one of the best cure-alls for headache and nausea hell."}
{"text":"Another stop that I have enjoyed so far in my visit to Pittsburgh. Place is clean. Very fun environment. I tried their Roast Beef and Cheese and oh gosh it was the bomb. Friendly staff. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and get the same quality product every time I order. New to the area and this is definitely my go to"}
{"text":"It's a Pittburgh institution.  Nothing about the sandwich is particularly great, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  I can't imaging going anywhere else in Pitt for a greasy gut bomb at 2 in the morning after a night of drinking.  It's got fries, coleslaw and grilled meat all between two slices of italian bread.  It's not trying to be anything more than that."}
{"text":"Going through my old reviews and finding that this place was my second review ever on Yelp and that was over four years ago and add to that that I only reviewed it with two sentences is just not right, so I need to redo that and serve it some justice.  Especially since this is the original location.

I still stand by my original review, sit at the bar area for quick service and some entertainment as the sandwiches are under construction.  This location is great, especially at the wee hours of the morning when you are finishing up your night out and want some food to help you on your way home.  In all honesty this place is like an after party spot.  People just seem to show up and cram inside.  The only scary place here are the restrooms located in the basement (you all know what I mean).

The food is excellent and not just during those wee hours.  It is something that can be feeling at anytime during the day.  I'm actually making myself hungry thinking about it right now.  I want myself a Jumbo, my go to sandwich when I come here.  When you think about it, you are getting a complete meal that you can hold in your hands, well mostly hold in your hands, it is inevitable that you will be dropping something out of that sandwich.  Meat and cheese cooked fresh on the griddle topped with hand cut fries, tomato and a heaping handful of Cole slaw; all that between thick sliced Italian bread.  Tell me that isn't heaven.

I may hear a few people talking about how that isn't their thing, a messy sandwich loaded with food where you just might have to wear a bib, but not to worry, they do have other things to eat.  It may not be many things, but they do carry chili and vegetable soup.  They also have those fries that you can order sans sandwich.  If you do, you must try the Smallman Street Fries.  These fries are topped with their chili, cheese, jalapenos and I'm fairly sure that I'm forgetting something else here, but they are so good, maybe even a bit unnecessary if you order a sandwich but totally worth it.  

Let us touch on the fact how beloved Primanti Brothers is in Pittsburgh.  You can talk smack  all you want about the rest of the city, but once you say something bad about a sammich from Primantis you will be labeled a jagoff and possibly get a beating.  It is a Pittsburgh institution as many other reviewers, national publications and television shows have said.  You mess with it, you mess with the city and troves of dedicated fans of Primantis.  

*Later tonight I just might stop by here."}
{"text":"This isn't the original location, but that doesn't detract anything from this location.  You can tell this is a college hot spot before you even walk in there.  It is located within steps of Pitt campus.  

It's actually quite a small space inside, but they were able to make due with what they had.  There is a bar, some seating in the main area, and there is a small loft type of area for seating as well.  

As far as the food goes, it's just like all other locations for Primantis.  Greasy and good.  And with most city locations, you get to watch the prepare your food in front of you.  That is one of the best things, being able to see your food being made, this way you know it's piping hot off the grill.  The staff in here at that time were very polite and made our food ordering experience a breeze.  

Might I add, only order extra meat if you are serious.  Honestly, your appetite may be more than your stomach can handle."}
{"text":"This could possibly be the worst location for a Primanti.  From the moment we walked in, until the moment that the food we ordered arrived, I was totally at a loss of words.

Granted it was busy when we arrived, but the serviced lacked so horribly that I thought about leaving without retrieving our food.  I ended up getting the usual and my friend just wanted an order of fries.  As the minutes grew on and the shoves became more and more obvious because people were trying to get closer to the bar my temper started to rise.

When the food finally was ready I asked for it to go at this point.  I was happiest when I was finally walking out the door, away from this crowded spot."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, ok, y'all need to calm down.  Quit with the 'it's too small,' 'it's a Pittsburgh thing,' and 'it's so greasy' statements.  That's what Primanti's IS.  It's a compact, greasy Pittsburgh right.  

Yes, the place is small, it is in Market Square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed if one day you wanted Primanti's and no more Market Square location?  I know I would.  If I were in the downtown region and had that craving I wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the Strip just for a bite of that Pittsburgh goodness.  

The 'it's a Pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  If you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'Manliest Restaurant in America,'  I think that means it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  Why else would Primanti's be featured on such media?  Why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a Primanti's?  I mean that has to show you it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.

And 'it's so greasy?'  Did you not watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  Expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  Maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of Italian bread.  

Better yet, move out of my way, I'm about to chow down on that Pittsburgh grease fest awaiting my attention."}
{"text":"I've been to several different Primanti locations within the city limits, but never to one outside and that is mostly a sit down/restaurant setting.  With that, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed it.

Within seconds of walking in the door we were sat and our drink orders were placed.  Unlike at city located Primanti's we actually had a menu to look at and I was a little mixed up.  I was surprised by the selections that they had.  I opted for the Coney Dogs.  Interesting way to make some dogs.  Instead of a traditional hot dog bun the use of Italian bread was a great way to go.  The dogs were topped with their chilly, filled with beans and meat.  Then topped with some shredded cheese.  A huge serving of fresh cut fries and a fried pickle completed the place.  

Was loving  the tunes being pumped in overhead, a nice mix of older rock hits that just seemed to be the appropriate selection for such a place.  Sports memorabilia lined the walls along with some Pittsburgh themed items.  

The wait staff was amazing, very attentive and on top of their game.  I can say that I will definitely revisit this location."}
{"text":"OK, if you know me, you know I enjoy a good sammich.  And in Pittsburgh you go to Primanti's to get a good sammich.  I have been wanting to try the new location for a while, but never had an opportune time to do so until recently.  This place is not hard to miss, a bright green building is definitely something you can't miss.

I am hoping that Primanti's sticks here.  This space has gone through several businesses already and it's about time that it has a constant business inside.

The decor is kind of a mix of dark and rustic.  Black definitely plays a presence here, maybe they do that to downplay the brightness of the outside of the building.  It kind of gives you an outdoorsy type of feeling inside.  Corrugated metal lines the wall, huge windows for tons of natural light, and there is also an outdoor patio that basically continues the flow in this place.

I went with my old faithful here and got myself the Jumbo.  I am still amazed each time I see the sammich coming at me.  It's like watching happiness approach you even though you know this happiness is going to be messy.  It's a gut-punch of a sammich.  There are times you have to take part of it home with you.  With this sammich, there is no need to order a side because the sandwich contains the side.  Make your side, if you must have one, a sweet libation.  Full bar available to make your whatever your poison is.

Staff is amazing here.  They were on top of everything.  Making it a breeze of a time here.  

Only downside, and for real this is the only downside, is that parking is near impossible around here.  If you come at a busy time you will have two choices, walk or either take public transit."}
{"text":"Most hyped restaurant in Pittsburgh. Would eat here for the experience,  food quantity is good..but nothing to rave about..too much stuffed in a sandwich to stuff your face..."}
{"text":"Had to visit the \"Famous\" Primanti Brother's Bar and Grill during my first visit to Pittsburgh, but most likely will only go back if my friends/family really  want to eat there.

Food:  The portions are huge, not very greasy, served nice and hot but over all very bland.  I got the Colossal Fish and Cheese sandwich.  The beer batter fish was a very large piece and by itself was not bad tasting at all (just a little under seasoned.)  The fries were limp and had no seasoning what so ever. The fries were the worse part of the sandwich.  The coleslaw was  very mild, sweet and vinegar base, and by itself it was ok, but put everything together between two slices of white bread and it made for a bland pile of flavorless starch.  The bread was also too soft and did not hold up well at all, and the cheese was nonexistent.  I ended up having to add a ton of salt, pepper and malt vinegar to my sandwich, picked it apart and ate the pieces with my fingers.

Price:  For the size of the portions you get, the price is great!  I got two sandwiches and a soda for about $16.  Their sandwiches range from around $6 - $8 each, and are a good value since you will definitely leave full (I took home left overs.)

Atmosphere:  After reading a few reviews about the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was not packed with tourist.  For being such a small dinner, the place was fairly empty so I was able to sit anywhere I liked (being a solo traveler, restaurants often try to stick me at the bar but I prefer to sit at a table.)  The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.

Staff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.

Over all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.  I would rather get a sandwich that is half the size with more flavor, then a huge pile of bland food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment this restaurant was!  Had wanted to go ever since hearing from friends that were from Pittsburgh and loved the downtown venue. 
Our party had sandwiches and I'll just write about mine, the pastrami.  Thick slices of soft white bread. A layer of delicious slaw. A thick layer of almost warm fries and about one ounce of pastrami. Seriously took the sandwich apart to try and find the meat with no success. I cannot believe this could be the norm but the Mt Lebanon location was a true bust. If you go order pizza unless you desire a greasy, meat free sandwich"}
{"text":"Meh. The foods great as always but idk about this location.. Way way too loud there all the time even when the game isn't on. I used to be crazy about Primanti's but not anymore."}
{"text":"Weird place. Maybe it's because I'm not from Pittsburgh but I did not enjoy the mound of unseasoned fries on my sandwich served on plain untoasted white bread. Also the sandwiches aren't served on plates, just pieces of wax paper???? Even my beer was a little off. And they made us sit on an outdoor patio. In February. Yes there was siding and small heaters but I had to keep my jacket on the entire time. This was my first impression of Pittsburgh and I don't think I'll ever be going back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love primantis?!!! A place where the French fries, ranch dressing, and beer never stop coming! It's a friendly atmosphere and if you aren't from the burgh the staff and patrons will make you feel welcome. Get the steak salad, but be forewarned this isn't going to fall in your paleo/no carb/low fat diet. It's totally worth it tho!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Pittsburgh this weekend to see the Pirates (cross another stadium off my list ), and couldn't depart for home without trying Primanti Bros after seeing them on the Travel Channel. Definitely didn't disappoint!! My wife had the bacon egg and cheese and I had the kielbasa and cheese - both sandwiches with fries, coleslaw, and tomato. OUTSTANDING!! Will be back on the next trip!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Nachos and one of their feature beers, all good. Enjoyed our waitress banter, a fun place to grab a snack after watching the Colonials game at the Island. 
You certainly need to navigate the menu for choice items, but this snack worked out for us. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Actually giving it 4 1/2 - the sandwich was delicious.  Ordered a capicola and cheese (with everything of course).  The combination of fries w/ their cole slaw, inside the sandwich was a bit difficult for me to eat, but definitely the way you have to eat it.  Not giving it a 5 only because I think they could' ve put more meat in the sandwich."}
{"text":"luv this place!

My first trip to Primanti's was back in the 90's and I've been hooked ever since.  I like the fact that they have opened up the more resturant / bar 
atmosphere locations, but the one in the Strip will always be my favorite.

The fries are just greasy enough to make the sandwich sinful! I'm not a big Cole slaw person but I can't resist a roast beef w/egg at the closest Primanti Brothers!!!"}
{"text":"So bummed...
All the way from Cincinnati to catch the experience. 
Wish we had went elsewhere.

Served by a skinny jeaned, hipster wannabe who could have cared less about us, his job, or his life.

Fries were cold, which is a big problem when they are in your sandwich. 

Not one return trip to see about refilling our drinks, or check if we needed anything else.

Kicker came when we paid the bill,  35 bucks for 2 sandwiches and a coke!

Reviewing the reciept, discover I am charged fir 3 sandwiches,  when I point out to the manager the error,  I have to wait for the hipster to come over, then they have to walkaway to have a private discussion???

She comes back, sighing heavily about \"now I have to void this and get this back'...
Uhm, okay, you do whatever needs done, just refund me my 8 bucks for the Phantom sandwhich.

Sorry Primantis, just like the Steelers, you got the name, but the reality is a far cry from the hype."}
{"text":"It must really be you either love this place or hate it.  Unfortunately, we were the latter.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why people love this place.  I knew there were mixed reviews out there, and I should have listened to my gut and skipped this.  We had the cheese steak - their #2 best seller (beer is their #1) and the BLT.  The sandwiches are a little large b/c of the pile on of cole slaw and fries.  Let me start with the bread - it's plain white bread.  Nothing special...at all.  The slaw was decent but there wasn't enough of it.  The fries were the worst part of the sandwich!  I love fries but these things were completely tasteless.  They were just soggy and bland.

I'm sure there are better places out there for lunch in Pittsburgh - I recommend you try to find those before coming to Primanti's."}
{"text":"Recommended by hotel staff. Love the Rueben sandwich. Service is very fast and excellent prices.  Open 24/7 so bathroom are not the best"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwiches in the world!! 

I wish I lived in Pittsburgh because these babies are tasty! LOL Even though I scrape off the slaw and tomato. The meat the bread and the fries so good!

It's been about 4 years since I've had one, and I'd say that's about 4 years too long. 

It was a cool location me and my girls were walking around town and walked there. 

Nice area, great food in a beautiful city!"}
{"text":"The ultimate Sammich. The ultimate joint. If you don't want to wait in line... you want classy service... you want ambiance... then don't go to a sammich shop. Go somewhere where sit outside and get an umbrella in your bottled water. This is good eats. Lunch pail stuff. This is where my stomach comes to relax."}
{"text":"Known for fries and cole slaw on huge sandwiches.  Not a big fan of the slaw, so I usually take some of it off the sandwich.  They are extremely filling so I usually take half of mine home.  The chili is good and the Smallman Street Fries are great.  Family pizza night on Tues. & Thurs. - better than average pizza.  Although known as a sports' bar, Ptrimanti's is definitely \"family friendly,\""}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of the Primanti's in the Pittsburgh area and I really don't understand all the hype. Overall, it is a nice bar and grill, but I don't know why it is \"the place to go.\" I also didn't know it was so \"chainy\", there are like 15 locations, which kind of takes away from its \"mom and pop\" appeal. I got the turkey and cheese overstuffed sandwich and it was good, but again nothing out of this world. It is very comparable to The Winking Lizards or Panini's in the Cleveland area in terms of atmosphere, food selection, and number of locations (but I like Winking Lizard better). If you go to Pittsburgh and you've never been, I'd go, because everyone will ask you if you did. However, I don't expect you to be dying to go back."}
{"text":"Apparently the quintessential Pittsburgh eatery... a reputation it deserves. I rented a car just to drive here from the airport on my 3 hour layover, and it was worth it! It will be unusual for non-locals, but grab a seat at the counter and watch them pile on handfuls of coleslaw and fries onto each sandwich. I had a capicola/cheese sandwich that was out of this world. I had to try the chili fries too, and it can feed a 2 people easily.... above-average.

One warning: finding street parking will be difficult."}
{"text":"Great food in large portions, with good service and a great atmosphere! A must try if you're visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ok. That's all. It's considered a staple of Pittsburgh right? Nothing special for me. I don't eat beef so I guess if you do then get their burger because I think that's the only special thing. 
Customer service is bad. Slow actually that's all. We stood in the takeout line forever and the staff was ignoring us and I had to shout to someone behind the grill to let them know I need to order take out. There were three people standing around that could have asked me instead of me asking. 

I had the chicken and cheese and it was really good. The filling to bread ratio was bad though. The white bread just gets all soggy and can't hold the weight of the chicken piece. Still tasted good though not the best sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here to get a sandwich. I grew up in PGH and was visiting hoping to get a taste of home but felt a little rushed by the waitresses. When  I finally got up to pay I overheard one of the workers saying here they  come like they where talking about us. Food was good but kinda bummed that I felt rushed out."}
{"text":"Unhealthy food. French fries in a sandwich? Ugh!"}
{"text":"A flight attendant says to me at the airport \"first time in PIT?\" I said yeah mostly do international. She says you gotta get a Primanti Bros. sandwich; sold. 

This place is legit. Ashley took care of us at the bar. Decent selection of draft beer. Wish they offered more local on draft. Got 5 Smokey bbq wings to start and then a pastrami and provolone sandwich. Huge portions. I'm a fan. No clue why this place gets anything less than 4 stars; it's a sandwich and wing joint."}
{"text":"Dear Primanti Brothers,
Yelp says that you are open until midnight on Sunday.
The sign on your door says the same thing.
So why, Primanti Bros, why at 11:15 tonight were all of your stools up and your doors locked without even an explanation of why you were closed up early?

It wasn't like you were cleaning up when we got there. The floor lights were off and the manager was doing the end of the night count. Based on previous experience, I'd say you had been closed since at least 10:30, if not earlier than that.

Just as a recap: 10:30 =/= midnight.

No love, 
Me

I normally hate the people who write reviews without actually eating at the restaurant, but in this case I felt entitled :\

It gets two stars instead of one because I'm an optimistic person who hopes that maybe tonight was just a fluke or an emergency and not just a lazy staff. I might go back someday, but I probably won't bother. BLEH.


EDIT: Somebody from this area tells me that that isn't normal and tonight was probably an exception. That's pretty much what I figured, but is a sign to much to ask for?"}
{"text":"Great food! Even better service! Thank you to Tanner and Valerie for bringing great energy and laughter to a long day of travel. Flew out from San Diego, Ca. To visit our grand mother for her 99th birthday. Because of a delay at the gate we were concerned to how limited we would be for good eats after 11:50pm. We called another restaurant  who said their kitchen was open, but when we arrived, they were no longer serving food. Dejected we continued back towards our hotel, when we saw Primanti Bros.... We took a chance and whipped into the parking lot, I ran inside and asked if they were still serving food... This was 1am.. They said \"YES! Our kitchen is open till 2am on Fridays and Saturdays\"  OMG a kitchen actually open till the establishment closes! Wonderful! 
 We were ecstatic, and when we ordered the food, the taste was great. The manager Tanner was great to talk to and laugh with, and Valerie was a fun, quality server. Thank you both for the great end to our evening,"}
{"text":"You can't have a successful bar crawl in the South Side without a late night stop at Primanti Brothers to soak up the alcohol.

Cole slaw, thick potato fries, and the meat of your choice on fresh baked Italian bread. All my heart could desire at 2:00AM!

I frequently visit this Primanti Brothers location, and love the classic Pittsburgh sandwiches they serve.  People aren't going to culinary school to make their sandwiches, but for an awesome, \"blue collar\" sandwich that will satisfy your hunger and taste buds these are simply amazing.

This local restaurant is everything you'd expect from a Primanti Brothers, and anticipate that I'll be stopping in to visit on my next great Pittsburgh adventure."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a wedding and one of the places my gf who was with me wanted to eat at was Primanti Bros. You can either sit at table inside or outside and eat there or stand in the \"to go\" line. Since there were no tables available and we only had a few hours before the wedding, we opted to go. I ordered the italian sausage sandwich. So side note, we didn't eat the entire day, so in the moment, the sandwich hit the spot....in an okay way. I didn't think it was anything spectacular but the portion was pretty big. I did like the use of coleslaw instead of lettuce, not too keen on the fries, which is like carb overload.

So afterwards I asked myself, if I wasn't so starving, would I go back and eat a sandwich from there again? And the answer was, probably not. But you satiated my appetite, so thank you."}
{"text":"If you're in town and want to experience a little bit of Pittsburgh and what the area is known for, that'd be Primanti brothers. They have a great happy hour which has great draft beers and a lot of TVs to watch the big games on. I personally love the the mozzarella wedges because I'm a huge fan of mozzarella sticks and I always find myself going back to get these. The marinara sauce that comes with the wedges is pretty weak, but they're so good they really don't need the marinara dipping sauce. Then for the main course I either get the buffalo wings which are always consistent or the legendary primanti brothers sandwich which has the fries and coleslaw on the sandwich. The sandwich is what Pittsburgh is known for. I normally get the capicola sandwich or the pittsburger style sandwich. Both are good options just be aware if you get your order to go you have a knife to cut it in half if you don't want it to get messy. Also sometimes I've ordered the sandwich and sometime the fries that came on the sandwich were heavy on the salt, but with the coleslaw it usually evens out the salt ratio so still really good. I always come back to primanti's at least a few times a month. You will definitely enjoy this place, if your not from the area and want a Pittsburgh experience this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I had the Colossal Kicked Up Fish with the Old Bay fries!! It was very tasty! I also enjoyed an Angry Orchard that was ice cold. It was very refreshing since the fish was piping hot! Good service and speedy despite the fact that the place was packed Friday night. Will return again for sure!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the Pittsburgh area and could not wait to try this place out. On Sunday we were starving after moving all day and driving seven hours, we stopped by for carry out. Somehow we ordered six sandwiches but only got five. We called the place and somebody told us just come by and will take care of you next time. Well I just called and caught a massive attitude from a manager name \"Jamie\". All I wanted was the sandwich. One on Sunday and one today. But I got nothing, but an attitude from \"Jamie\". I'm not going to any of the restaurants in this chain if I can help it."}
{"text":"Been to Primanti Brothers before, but never this one, the original location! On my most recent trip I decided that a visit was long overdue. 

I do love the exterior of this location, and it looked especially cool with the icicles hanging from the roof (see picture!). I love that you know what you're getting when you walk in. Real, down to earth place with no pretensions. Waitress was super friendly and ... real. What you see is what you get with this place. 

It does differ from the Market Square location a bit - no credit cards & no tap beer. Both things are only slightly annoying though, not enough to make me stop coming! 

Tried a new sandwich this time - the \"Ragin' Cajun' Chicken\" with everything. Pretty darn good, but it wasn't too-too spicy.

When in the 'Burgh, it's a must visit!"}
{"text":"Well, almost exactly one year later I had my 2nd Primanti Bros sandwich. This time I give it 5 stars. It's a great place. It's local, and yet all the tourists go there. Sat at the aluminum counter this time, definitely a different experience. Will definitely be getting a sandwich from here every time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"If you're from Pittsburgh and you rate this place lower than a five you have some real issues. sacrilege! You don't see people from Philly rating their cheesesteaks low do you? Enough said. Five out of five."}
{"text":"For this to be called a staple of Pittsburgh it fails in comparison. The wait was extremely long and it was limited seating which was troublesome. I order the burger thinking how can you mess up a burger, and bam, they did it. My meal was below average and the fries were soggy and bland. Totally a waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy..."}
{"text":"Came here twice. Both times the food was good and the minimal wait staff was very attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Great sammich !  Tried pastrami, capricola, and corned beef sandwiched all w fried egg, slaw, fries... A must try when in Pitt."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to drive a bit out of the way last week on our road trip to Virginia to try this Man v Food feature. He ordered the \"cheese steak\" which surprisingly was more like a steak/burger patty while I ordered the corned beef. The quality of the meat in my sandwich was fine, but the \"unique\" attributes and what should be the stars of the sandwich - the fries and slaw - were severely underwhelming. The fries were undercooked, mushy and desperately needed seasoning yet salt and pepper shakers were nowhere to be found. The slaw was bland, so bland we both agreed that if it wasn't on the sandwich we wouldn't have even noticed. My friend complained that his cheese steak was dry (the small piece of cheese was hard to detect) and he had to keep using hot sauce just to get it down. Not exactly a good sign. It may have been better had he paid 50 cents for extra cheese. Oh yeah - the sandwich maker behind the counter was friendly, but made up both sandwiches without gloves and I never saw him wash his hands. I'm not normally a germophobe but I thought that was odd.

All in all we both agreed that the sandwiches were \"decent\" but it definitely is not worth driving out of the way for. I guess this is another one of those local legends that out of towners just don't get."}
{"text":"This is a neither a yay or nay place for me.  Understanding the underlying concept of the sandwiches from way back when, can make a person appreciate Primanti's for what they are.

I ordered the pastrami served on two thick slices of bread, layered with french fries and cole slaw.  Granted, I like my carbs, but this was overload for me.  I wasn't particularly fond of the cole slaw either.  

I think this is more of an acquired taste kind of place.  Not that I wouldn't go back, it's okay for an occasional visit.  There are other sandwiches to try.  But if you're used to the true pastrami with Swiss on rye, I wouldn't recommend the sandwich here.

The place itself is small and good for a group of four.  Eight if you don't mind sitting at two separate tables that are relatively close to each other."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, so much deliciousness. Cole slaw and fries on top of food that will elicit a chorus à la Handel's Messiah from any drunkard worth her salt. 

Glasses of beer that won't stop urging you to take a gander at their naked bottoms.  

All the goodness of tasty food that compels writers to make exclusive use of fragmented sentences.

I wanted to have an orgy with all the Primanti Brothers as a token of my gratitude, but since I almost fainted due to claustrophobia in the narrow stairwell on my way to the pissah, I suppose a thank you will just need to suffice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each experience is so-so. The first time everything was amazing. The second time I had won a gift card so my boyfriend and I went and everything was dry. When we went the third time, my boyfriend and I, we only order appetizers. That was better than before. The servers don't really give you much attention. We went as a group of 6 to drink and eat. It was so difficult to get drinks. Our server went and sat down 3 tables away to eat while we were trying to order more drinks and food. We sat there for 20 minutes until he came back to ask if we wanted more drinks. He was taking forever to grab beers and bring them to us, 20 minutes, and we were some of the only people there. The server, Corey, messed up all of our checks several times. After five tries he finally got things right. We were furious about the lack of serves that we left him with $1 tip between everyone. 

I hate not tipping 20% but if I'm going to be ignored or watch you eat and drink while we have nothing I'm going to tip in reflection to my serves."}
{"text":"My wife and I actually made the two-plus hour drive from Cleveland with the sole purpose of giving the famous Primanti Brothers a try. We've heard about it from friends, we've seen it on the Food Network and we simply had to give it a go for ourselves. 

Our visit was on a Saturday just before lunchtime. We knew there were plenty of locations for this place but we figured we'd better go to the original. It's located downtown in an older industrial area. For out-of-towners it can be a challenge to find. We managed OK with the help of our GPS.

We entered the space which isn't much bigger than most small bars and were seated at the back bar. It's small, there's exposed brick and there are two bars. Other than that, it's not much to talk about. Just about every table was full and the bars were nearly stuffed as well. Our server/bartender was friendly and prompt and not prone to the diarrhea of the mouth that seems to inflict most bartenders. We ordered a side of fries and two sandwiches - tuna and turkey.

First, let me start by saying that I get the whole \"landmark\" thing. They've been operating in the same location since 1933. They're a Pittsburgh institution. There's something to be said for a local business with staying power. It just becomes part of the city, nearly inseparable from the location itself. That being said, I've got to comment on the food.

If you go to Primanti Brothers you had better be in the mood for a sandwich cause that's about all you're gonna get. Oh, and there are sides, but they consist of everything you already get on the sandwiches. There are a number of variations on the theme, but for the most part you get:

-Soft, white Italian bread
-Vinegar-based slaw
-Fries
-Tomato
-Some sort of base meat

For my money, it's just OK. It's tasty and it's filling, but it's nothing to really write home about. I'd prefer a mayo-based slaw and crispy fries, but it is what it is. Maybe it's because I'm not genetically predisposed to have to love it or maybe it's because I can get exactly the same sandwich here in Cleveland at Panini's (sure, it's a blatant rip-off, but I don't really care).  Either way, I wasn't impressed. I had much more fun visiting the street market that was going on during our visit than I had during my dining experience at Primanti Brothers. 

If you live in Cleveland, don't bother. Just head over to Panini's and save yourself alot of time and gas money."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place when I told my friends I was visiting Pittsburgh. I ordered the \"Pitts-burger\" sandwich which was dry, under seasoned, and very disappointing to say the least. The meat seemed like it was previously frozen and reminded me of a Salisbury steak you'd be served at lunch in a cafeteria. The fries were unsalted and required lots of ketchup. The coleslaw lacked flavor and the bun was simple white bread. 

I know there is a lot of hype surrounding this place but I would recommend heading elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a conditional review. If you're drunk or hungover, Primanti gets 5 stars. Otherwise, it's an unimpressive and unwieldy sandwich. Dry/vinegar cole slaw and french fries along with normal sandwich filling between two thick slices of bread is good, but it's not the transcendent sandwich food network makes it out to be."}
{"text":"I've visited a number of Primanti Brothers locations and am a fan of their food. The service at this location, however, was awful. When we walked in the manager attempted to seat us even though there was a perfectly capable hostess standing right there. He took us into the dining area, asked us to wait in an awkward location and then disappeared. He never wrote our name or party number down at the hostess station or even bothered to tell her that we would need seated. We waited there for about 20 minutes, and a few other parties who seemed to have just walked in were seated ahead of us. At one point the manager even walked up to us again and asked if we needed a table. I honestly believe that in his mind this was the first time he had ever interacted with us.

After grabbing the hostess and explaining the situation, we were seated pretty quickly. Sadly that was not the end of our troubles. Our waiter was very obnoxious and more interested in hearing himself talk than actually listening to anyone. I got the impression that he was trying to imitate a tough-guy New York deli owner you might see on TV. A number of people asked for their coleslaw on the side because, frankly, it's gross. Each time he challenged the person, claiming that they must not have eaten here before and that we didn't know what we were doing and that \"that's just how we do it here in Pittsburgh\" (Just for the record we were all born and raised in Pittsburgh and have eaten at Primanti Brothers countless times). I think he thought he was being charming like those beloved caricatures he was clearly imitating from TV, but it was really just annoying.

I like Primantis a lot, and it was nice to visit the original location, but I think that status of \"first\" may have gone to their head. I would definitely recumbent that you visit a different location. Additionally, the other locations I've visited have wider beer and mixed drinks selection and more items on the menu, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly a fan of this place but hubby loved it! It's cheap and filling, and it's fun to add fries to your sandwich. Just don't expect too much -- it is just sandwich and fries after all."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Good prices. What else is there to say? Primanti Brothers is a Pittsburgh institution and my experience certainly lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Passing through Pittsburg (my mother's home town) on the way from LA to NY...

Call up Mom

Mom, do your uncles or cousins know of the best place to try the local fare?

\"Let me talk to Terry and find out\"

5 minutes later...Mom calls back and says Primanti Bros...noted for fries on their sandwich.

A couple of teeth pulling moments of telling my Mom we don't need directions...we have iPhones and an hour later and we're in Downtown Pittsburg enjoying our Primanti Bros. meal.

I ordered the  capicola, my girlfriend ordered the fish, and my friends got the pastrami and the steak salad.

The pickled and peppered cabbage is a nice treat on a sandwich piled high with fine deli meat and french fries...

Not something that you could eat every day without coronary bipass, but that doesn't stop this sandwhich from deserving 5 stars...a party for the mouth."}
{"text":"Thank you Adam Richman!! We had seen it on Man vs. Food and our mouths watered after seeing the sandwhiches.This was our second restaurant stop while visiting PGH with my fiance during the summer. We split the steak sandwhich (added a fried egg) and chilli cheese fries. Both were absolutely delectable! We were even served by the spunky older lady seen helping Adam on MVF. It was a great treat. Since we live in AZ and can't get this awesome sandwhich whenever our hearts desire we make our own \"Primanti Brothers\" style sandwhich at home...we still can't get that special cole slaw recipe down though! We'll definitely be coming back on our next PGH trip!"}
{"text":"yikes!! just make sure you don't go there during lunch. it's def a ton of food and sure cause for afternoon food coma. 

the food itself was delish. never really thought of putting everything, including the sides, in a sandwich... but it works. def something to try if/when you're out there."}
{"text":"What can be said of Primanti Bros. (pronounced \"Primanny's\") that hasn't been said already in other locations?  This suburban location fills up fast on game nights, offering beer specials and dollar pizza slices.  Even during the day, you'll find it a welcoming place to sit down on the pew-like booth benches, order a sandwich with hot fries and cold tangy slaw inside the rich, substantial slices of bread, and wash it down with an Iron City draft.

For those who have never visited Primanti's before:

1. Don't ask for the fries on the side.  They might oblige, but you're missing out.

2. Don't ask for the slaw on the side.  See item 1 above.  (Though I love a $1.50 side of slaw; it's a light, vinegar-style slaw bursting with crunchy wisps of thread-thin cabbage.)

3. If you're wondering why the menu advertises a \"#2 best seller\" but doesn't mention the #1 best seller, have a beer and think about it.  They'll tell you if you ask, but it's more fun to figure it out on your own.

4. Don't ask for a plate.  Your sandwich will be delivered on wax paper in a paper basket.  If you want something fancier than that, you're in the wrong place."}
{"text":"Let me just say, I love Primantis! The food, the company, all if it. 

I enjoyed my visit to this location immensely! Only negative--it was SO LOUD. It was pretty late on Saturday night & everyone was there to watch the pens. 

Our waitress was attentive and really pleasant. 

Get the nachos grande! It was amazing. my boyfriend and I plan to go again this Saturday to get nachos! Yum. 

Service was kinda slow, but it was super busy--it was not slow enough to be irritating at all. 
We were told 25-30 min wait, but were seated in 12, so that was good. 

Great experience, I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"If you are about to go here for your FIRST Primanti's experience, DON'T. I've had MUCH better service at the Oakland location, but I recommend a location outside the city over these. 

I LOVE Primanti's. I love everything about it and love that it's a Pittsburgh staple. I think the food is amazing. But the service at this Primanti's was unbearable. Okay, so it was slow because it was Saturday night, that is understandable. But the way the waitress was handling it? Unacceptable. She was unbelievably rude and had a terrible system of keeping  track of her tables. She was forgetting everyone's order and rarely apologizing. Terrible customer service. I never leave less than a 20% tip, but had to this night. I understand being stressed because it's busy, but you gotta suck it up and put a smile on.

I was so disappointed by this location. It's in a super nice area of downtown and one of the main locations that people from out of town come to try Primanti's. So upsetting. I contacted corporate, so hopefully they get this location in check."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh visiting Carnegie Mellon U and was told we had to come here. I ordered the local famous burger. Can't remember the name but it was really good. The bartender was cool and the atmosphere was dope too. Cool place. I'd spend my money there again."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh must-visit with good (not great) sandwiches in very generous portions.  Family restaurant/sports bar range atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Really? Is this what Pittsburgh considers their best sandwich? The pittsburgher?! I've had 47 sandwiches better than this."}
{"text":"Visited friend John Mo in Pittsburgh for one night and he brought me here...great move. Big fatty sandwich but really really delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you really have to visit if you're in from out of town. It just captures the flavor of the local culture beautifully.

I had the cheesesteak which is uniquely adorned with fried and coleslaw to become a \"Pittsburger\". The sandwich itself isn't all that exciting, but it is good, and it's grilled up right in front of you. My buddy had the ragin' cajun chicken sandwich which was not as spicy as advertised, but he did report that it was good.

Wash it down with a Yuengling, and life is good. 

It's ain't fancy, the service could hardly be called friendly, but it's one of those local joints you really have to see and taste for yourself."}
{"text":"You'll need Tums and a shot of whisky to wash down the grease but rest assured, it's a Pittsburgh delight.  Long life Primanti Bros!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to visit this fantastic place when I was on my job on the Great American Queen and I will say this place has some great food. Now the only reason I wanted to go there is because Man vs Food has gone there and the food looked delicious. I will say if you have a chance to go there make sure you get there early because that place will get packed very quickly....hope I'm able to go there in the future..."}
{"text":"Really, Pittsburgh? The Primanti bros cheeseteak is the best sandwich in the world? Didn't make me very happy. The freezer-burned soggy fries, bland bread, and gross hamburger patty just didn't cut it. It would be wise to skip this place.

Might be worth a stop for $2.50 big beers - anytime. That's a keeper."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich and cool diner. The Strip District is the spot to visit and Primanti Bros needs to be on every tourists list to eat."}
{"text":"Coleslaw and fries in your sammich tastes just as good as it sounds.

If you think it sounds awesome, then you'd probably find it awesome.

If you think it sounds nasty, then you'd probably find it nasty.

If you think it sounds questionable and confusing, then your'e not alone, because that's exactly how I felt after eating it, too.  Why, Primanti Brothers, why??"}
{"text":"My order didn't get started cooking till I came to pick it up and the hostess went to talk to the chef. I was made to STAND and wait by the front door while people walked in and out for at least 10 mins. I don't mind waiting for my food, but I ordered and paid online an hour in advance because I had places to be."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-visit when you're in Pittsburgh. Definitely get one of the sandwiches with fries and coleslaw in them (which is all of the sandwiches). Don't ask for the fries on the side, that defeats the purpose.

You'd be surprised how well the sandwich stays together given how packed it is, but it stays together well and makes for a really good indulgent meal. I got the genoa salami and really enjoyed it. Service isn't awesome but given how busy and touristy the place is it's about as good as you can expect."}
{"text":"Being in Pennsylvania, albeit not Philly, I searched Yelp this morning for a Cheesesteak near where I am staying.  Primanti Brothers came up at the top of the list.  I walked over to the shop and took a seat at the bar. Looking up at the menu I was a bit dissapointed to see no \"cheesesteak\" but they did have the Pitts-Burgher Steak (our #2 top seller).  I ordered, and the gentleman next to me said the sandwich was good, he was from Illinois and said that he had seen the place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives.  That amped up my expectations a bit.  

The waitress who was friendly mentioned that the sandwich was a mess, but that was a good thing.  But speaking of messes, the grill and fryers were filthy, but then again what else should I expect.

My sandwich arrived and it was an impressive quantity of food and utterly unique meal between bread.  There is a rectangular patty, provelone cheese, fries topped by slaw between two slices of italian bread.  The bread was great, but the rest of the sandwich was short on flavor.  The patty was just kinda a brown mass, and the fries and slaw topping the patty were just kinda there.  I found myself adding malt vinnegar to the slaw and eventually dipping in ketchup to add  some flavor.

I got out for $10, tip included.  For good price, good quantity of food, and friendly staff I give this place 3 stars, but no more because the flavor isn't there"}
{"text":"Had to make at least one stop while in town on business.  Ended up making two stops.  One night for a sandwich with the works and another night for pizza.  The food was great  and so was Jen (out waitress both nights)."}
{"text":"You can't come to Pittsburgh and not have a Primanti sandwich. This is a staple in our city. The menu has grown and typically there is something for everyone. On price it really can't get any better with all the food you get. For the kids it's a great place to eat as well. Awesome spot to watch games and great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service is great. Sandwich needs less fries and bread. Good concept, glad I tried it, and really good meat."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this location only has a handful of reviews, as it's right on the main drag of Southside. Now that I think about it, that's a perfectly logical explanation for there being only a few reviews, as I'm sure most patrons of this location don't recall the exact flavors and textures of their sandwich...

Anyway, I'd heard great things about this place, so my friend and I started our night in Pittsburgh with a 22oz Yeungling and splitting the cheese steak and the pastrami. If you've read any of my previous reviews, you may notice I love pastrami sandwiches, but I must say that I was underwhelmed by the offering at Primanti Brothers. There were only two slices of pastrami! The sandwich was dominated by fries and slaw, which for me took away from the experience of a pastrami sandwich. The cheese steak was much better. The meat was sliced thick and had a great flavor, and the texture just seemed to be more balanced than the pastrami. My friend and I split each sandwich and both agreed that the cheese steak took the proverbial cake.

You don't come here for the service, but it was pretty meh. Our waitress forgot to put in our order for a side of fries, even though I reminded her twice. However, she not only brought us a side of cheese sauce for free, but she forgot to charge us! Sometimes bad service pays off. Anyway, we were out the door for about 10 bucks a pop including tip, which in my mind is a bargain for a famous sandwich and a 22oz brew. The restaurant definitely has character, so if you're looking for a late dinner/early drink on Carson, I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Since I am dating a steel city native, this was a must do while visiting his home town this past weekend. The line was out the door around lunch time however it was constantly moving and we were through the doors in 10minutes. 
Once inside you are whisked away to a cozy booth and orders are taken right away. The service at this place is great! The waitresses actually smile and seem to really like working for the owners of Primanti's. The walls are decorated with the establishments awards and recognitions from famous athletes and tv celebs; definitely keeps you entertained. Also everyone in there is from everywhere around the country.
We had the popular item on the menu- The Pittsburger: philly cheese steak topped with french fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes on the AMAZING Mancini's bread. I have never had anything like it and loved this monster of a manwich. 
Can't wait to go back to Pittsburgh to get me some more Primanti's!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about these sandwiches, and decided one Saturday to take an overnight drive to Pittsburgh.  I don't think the sandwich was that great, but it was worth the drive and made my husbands day! He loved it.  Now, the french fries, those were really good!  Would definitely make the trip back and give the sandwiches another try."}
{"text":"This is why we eat. To go to dingy landmarks that are older than any citizen and filled with local beer and sports fans. Came for the cheese steak, stayed for the cheese steak. Bread thick and hearty, meat tender and juicy, slaw, fries and all other toppings, fantastic. The young lady cooking the food up is a sweetheart too, amazing service, I want give her a hug I am so happy, but a tip will have to do. I will always return here when I come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I had to go on my first trip to Pittsburgh after seeing it on the FoodNetwork. The employee recommended the corned beef. I got it to-go so I can eat out in Market Square since it was such a great day. I learned that by getting it to-go, they wrapped the sammich so tight that it flattened the bread to nothingness (see picture I posted). 

I was expecting a mayo based coleslaw, but it's vinegar based (which was better and better for you). Like others have said, the meat quantity is so small that it's a sidekick to the coleslaw and fries. I really liked the overall flavor. I just wished the meat, slaw, and fries were more in proportion to one another. (again, see picture). Having lived in NY/NJ, I'm used to the deli sandwiches where it's nothing but meat with two slices of bread. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this piece of local PIT culture and that's what counts. For $6-8, you can't beat it when you're in Pittsburgh, esp. when y'uns warsh it down wit some Yeungling Ale."}
{"text":"Good service. Cold beer. Classic Pittsburgh.

The place was packed but we didn't have to wait long. The service was good and the sandwiches were BIG!  This is a must-visit when visiting the Steel City."}
{"text":"Service was the best.pizza is delish Always get dble meat on sandwiches, my fav is the pastrami
Wait staff always do an excellent job"}
{"text":"While visiting family in the area my cousin insisted on eating here....I'm glad she did! I love places like this, that the locals eat at and are proud of. I equate it to getting a Coney Dog or a Detroit style pizza in my hometown. The service was very pleasant, the food was super filling. Normally I don't eat the bread with my sandwiches or at the very least take off the top bun, but not here. The bread is thick and delicious and I enjoyed every carb-loaded bite. We all got the burger and I got mine with grilled onions. Super delicious, and that slaw would be good on anything!  

Way to go Pittsburgh...You've got a gem here and a great place to be proud of!"}
{"text":"Totally worth the hype. Delicious and unique food! Definitely worth the price. Lots of good options. I will definitely come back when I'm in the area and keep suggesting to others."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is pronounced like this - Prih - MAN - Tee. It is not Prih - Mahn - Tee. People from Pittsburgh will take this error very seriously.

So, onto the food. The famous Primanti Brothers roast beef sandwich is a very regular sandwich with some soft fries and OK coleslaw in it. The size of the sandwich is \"above average\" but it is not the gargantuan monster that I was hoping to see. The roast beef is fine but it really isn't anything to write home about. 

Primanti Brothers suffers from \"Philly Cheesesteak Syndrome\" - It is a food item that has come to represent a city's food scene and really just for tourists. It is fine food at a reasonable price but there are a hundred other, superior options."}
{"text":"Well, I guess I'm happy with leaving 3 stars. Like my previous review stated, I realy didn't like Primanti's when I lived here during college. I've been back tiwce since graduating (one in February from my last review) and once in July, when I brought my bf. He had heard all about the famous sandwiches, so he wanted to try one.

My buffalo chicken sandwich wasn't quite as good as last time, and he was underwhelmed with his after hearing the hype. So, I think we'll leave it with 3 stars.

Not the best restaurant, but not terrible, either."}
{"text":"We love this place and make a point of coming here at least once every time we are in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately they got rid of the knockwurst sandwich (tragic), but the kielbasa is a close second. The BLT tots are delicious and the wings are some of the best we've ever tried, especially the maple chipotle bbq and spicy garlic. Service is usually fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh to the core.  It's not a good sandwich unless you have fries on it!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit obsessed.

I came here with a Pittsburgh native who told me that Primanti's is a Pittsburgh thing, so I definitely had to go. Hearing that all of their sandwiches come with french fries and cole slaw, I was sold.

The inside is dated, but fun with wood paneling on the walls. When you get in and sit at a table, there's a menu on the wall. The gist is that you pick the meat that goes on the sandwich and they all come with french fries, coleslaw and onions. There were some interesting choices on the board, so I thought I'd play it safe and get bacon.

WHAT A GREAT IDEA! The slaw was great, not too much mayo. The french were crispy yet soft on the inside, and the bacon was crispy as well. My sandwich was in the $6 range and it filled me up!

Will have to come back and try a different meat variety.

CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"This place was great! The hostesses were exceptionally trained and well-organized. There was a wait, but the atmosphere is so great that we didn't mind much at all. Once we were seated, we chose from the long list of drinks this place has to offer. We also got boneless wings and they were AMAZING! The sandwiches they rave about are okay, and the pizza was the same. But if you just want a wings and fries place, this is a great place to go! Our waiter wasn't the best. We had to wait several minutes to get refills multiple times, even though he passed our table often. But overall, it was a great experience and if you are looking for a great bar setting, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop if you are visiting Pittsburgh from what I have been told so of course I made the trip here and was not disappointed. I ordered the Pastrami and added the egg to the sandwich it was unreal. My only complaint was that they didn't have other types of bread to chose from. I ordered the Steak & Cheese to go as well, great choice as well."}
{"text":"The primantis in moon is seriously hard to beat and used to be my go-to, but since moving I've enjoyed coming to this franchise! The service is (almost) always excellent and the food is out of this world. As a yinzer, I really appreciate Pittsburgh tradition and primantis is part of that. They're happy hour is seriously the best (half off!!) and there are a ton of TVs to watch the Steelers, Buccos, and Pens! Love this place."}
{"text":"Overhyped. I was disappointed with everything--the fries, Pitts-Burger and buffalo wings. Why is this place so famous?"}
{"text":"Iiiiii don't get the appeal. While I liked my sandwich and the service was very quick and pretty good, it wasn't really anything to write home about. The sandwiches are gigantic! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The ingredients, as a standalone are halfway decent - the fries are the real deal and pretty good, the coleslaw is fresh and crunchy, etc. I just don't get why the sandwich is raved about. Overall my sandwich was pretty flavorless, not even salty. I wish there was a distinguishing flavor apart from like \"yep, that's egg, yep that's cabbage, yep, that's a potato.\" 

Ah well, it took me almost ten years to get around to visiting this place, and I don't think I'm too keen on going back. :-/"}
{"text":"We have been eating at this location for about five years. The service is always good and the food always delicious. A few menu favorites include the signature Primanti Bros style Cajun chicken sandwich and the baked Italian hoagie, in addition to the chicken salads and fries. Their pizza is also good. Tonight I branched out and tried the Primanti Bros stile colossal fish sandwich and it was out of this world. The fish was twice the size of the bread and the breading tasty and just the right amount."}
{"text":"Dropped in on Sunday, 12/22/2013, for a beer. We sat at the bar and were served promptly. Food looked amazing. The waitress checked in with us, we were under some time pressure so I took the opportunity to try to pay while things were slow.  Somehow the normal queues seem to have been missed and she simply stated \"oh, you can keep the tab open, there's no rush\" and walked away leaving the card on the counter.

And boy did she mean no rush. 

We finished our rounds and waited patiently, card on the counter, for the waitress to cash us out. Again, we were making our way to another event and seating was on our mind. We had arrived with plenty of time and somehow we had burned through that. 

She proceeded to avoid eye-contact taking her time with numerous other activities. Attempts to catch her attention were ignored. Stood up and put on coats, two of our party leaving to grab seats. We were beginning to be late. Still no attention. I began joking about whether our waitress already picked up the tab for us and we should just go. Rain began falling and people started to stream into the location from the holiday shopping happening outside. Still couldn't get cashed out and go. 

Finally I caught the attention of one of the other girls working there, who looked uncomfortable, deliberated with our waitress briefly and bluntly stated we could pay at the register. Third girl at the register seemed put-off by our intrusion and had to ask us what we had ordered, apparently a ticket wasn't available. 

Finally, freedom! 

I have never had to work so hard to pay a bill and leave. 

I'm easy to please, minor attention, get my order to me and cash me out in a timely manner. This trip was one of the few times I've ever struggled to find a compelling reason to tip once the bill came. I plan to drop by the original Primanti Bros located later this week. Here's to hoping the service is a bit better there."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you tell me that you're putting fries on a sandwich, I'm pretty much sold. I got the burger and was so pumped. I thought it was pretty good, but I ended up wishing it were a lot better. Mostly because the fries lacked flavor (so so sad) and the super cold coleslaw on the warm everything else just kind of felt weird texture-wise. I think this place is perfect for college kids, families, and for the stop at a legendary native shop, but I probably would not return."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were huge and tasty.  The only issue was the fries on the sandwiches were cold.  Being an out of towner, not sure if that is normal or a \"one offer\".  Cheese fries and Iron City on tap rocked."}
{"text":"One of the better Primanti Brothers.  When you go into this place you really get the feel of what Primanti's is supposed to be.  Nothing fancy, just some basic tables and an menu of the huge Pittsburgh sandwich with choice of meat/cheese and fries, coleslaw, and tomato in the sandwich.  It's huge and hard to eat but delicious and a must try if you've never been to Pittsburgh.

One nice thing about this location is that it has just been remodeled a bit everything in the kitchen area looks really clean.  Don't worry, they did not make anything fancy though, you still get that Prmanti's feeling when you walk into the place.

The manager at this location also took the time to personally great our table.  Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches as you expect, but a bit of a touristic atmosphere.  I'm a stickler for the original in the strip!"}
{"text":"I got a Fast, fresh, grilled chicken salad to go!  I miss Pittsburgh salad's with fresh cut fries and melted cheese....I cannot find this anywhere in Los Angeles!  Which is probably a good thing that LA eateries DO NOT know how to make fresh cut French Fries!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! There girls work together so well and is like a welcome committee to the city!! Parking was a bit tricky because of some construction in the square, cool area tho. Food - odd the way they put things together, you would think it would taste nasty but actually it's awesome... slaw, fries and all!!"}
{"text":"I don't remember when's the last time I had a healthy meal...

Oops I ate too much today...gonna feel really sad and chunky later...

Primanti Bros. Sandwich 

A sandwich with the fries and coleslaw added right in.... Invented during the Depression so that day people could hold their entire lunch in one hand!

The flame grilled meats and the deep fried cod fish....the tasty coleslaw.... the satis-fry's....six or seven bucks for a huge sandwich... It is the sandwich that is responsible for my taste bud awakening ... how I was able to put the US on the map. OK, I did go a little overboard.... Definitely try it at least once...since this is is what Pittsburgh is known for.... im not really a big fan of dry Italian bread as their buns for their yummy meaty goodness... wished they put more cheese inside the sandwiches...somewhat dry... the way they serve your meal...was in a bag or on a piece of paper...service was slow...waited about thirty five minutes for a sandwich is beyond me...lots of table seating...has their own parking lot...opens twenty four hours!!! which is great for late night munchies!!!"}
{"text":"My mom grew up in Pittsburgh, my grandparents still live there & I have been visiting since I was a little kid. Upon arrival in the steel city, Primanti Bros is always the first place I ask to go to. I always get a Pitt-burger (the classic) sandwich, love the combination of sweet and salty between the cole slaw and french fries. I went to this particular location yesterday when I was in town for a family reunion. We had a large group of 10-15 people and had to sit at separate tables. There was a fantasy draft going on, and the restaraunt was packed. Our waitress, Michelle ROCKED! She was outgoing, quick to take our order and refill our glasses, and able to split separate checks between a loud group that was composed of several families at three tables. Thanks for the excellent service! 

Also, this time I tried adding egg on my sandwich and it was BOMB!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Arizona, going to the steelers game, and checked out this spot from all the hype! Got the double decker and it was good- but not what I had expected with everyone's two sense :) enjoyed our meal- but nothing that I had expected. Come here with no expectations and you will be pleased- forget the hype or you'll be disappointed :) 

With all that said, the meat on its own it unlike any Arizona slice, but the Sandwich as a whole was a bit overrated."}
{"text":"This location is the worst. They have horrible customer service. The last 3 times my boyfriend and I have gone there they've messed up the order with no apologies. The last time we were there we were told it was too late to order beer and that it was takeout only even though it was only 11:00 and they close at midnight. We ordered takeout and sat there. 20 minutes later they handed us the wrong order. When my boyfriend took the bag to the counter to tell them it wasn't ours the guy rudely yelled \"what? No it's right\" and grabbed the bag from him. When he realized he was wrong he just walked away without saying anything. We sat there a few more minutes, but no one was checking on us. None of the sandwiches being made were ours. We left and went to the Carson Street location and had amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"For those not familiar with Primanti Bros. (you obviously are not from Pittsburgh), their signature items are delicious, giant sandwiches featuring your choice of meat, provolone cheese, their delicious fries, Italian dressing based cole slaw, and tomato on two slices of Italian bread.  The sandwich was invented to serve the workers in the warehouses nearby during the early Twentieth Century.  By including the fries and slaw on the sandwich, it made it easier to serve them quickly.  They have other items on the menu, like soup and their \"Soon to be Famous Chicken Wings,\" but the sandwiches are definitely the featured attraction.

I had been to Primanti Brothers before, but this was my first visit to the original location in the Strip District.  As I expected, the original location was definitely a cut above the rest.  I went at 2 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon during football season.  When I arrived, I walked in and found an open seat at the bar.  The person who previously sat there had just left, so as I sat, the bartender (I didn't get her name.  But she was cute!) offered to clean the spot for me, and did.  She immediately asked me what I was drinking.  I ordered an I.C. (Iron City) Light, which she promptly went and got for me.  Then, right away, she asked me if I knew what I wanted to eat.  I told her I did, and she took my order.  I ordered my favorite, the Kielbasa and Cheese (see the photo I posted).  She put the order in right away, and, since the grill is actually behind the bar, right near where I was sitting, I saw the cook begin to prepare it.  It didn't take very long before the bartender brought me my sandwich, cut in half, and served on wax paper.  It also didn't take very long before I had completely consumed the sandwich, as the bartender observed after seeing it gone and the wax paper crumpled into a ball, \"Well!  It looks like you enjoyed that!\"  I confirmed that I did.  It was definitely better than the Kielbasa and Cheese that I had had at other Primanti Bros. locations before.  While I was eating my sandwich, I noticed the cook preparing the same for someone else, and I noticed her dropping the sausage into the fryer.  I don't know whether or not this is a common practice in restaurants, as all the restaurants where I worked didn't serve kielbasa.  But I thought it was interesting, and I think it gave the sausage a nice flavor, and rendered it both crispy and juicy.  I was definitely pleased.

The one negative about this place is that it is cash-only.  It's not really a big deal because there is an ATM inside.  I don't know how much the fee is to use it, but if you want to be safe, then just come prepared.

Finally, I have one more suggestion.  The Strip District has a nice market nearby, as well as a lot of street vendors selling fresh fruit, baked goods, souvenirs, and sports memorabilia from the local teams.  You may want to arrive early and spend some time browsing before dining, or check it out afterwards.

I love Primanti Brothers, and will definitely be checking out the original location in the Strip District the next time I get to return to this wonderful city!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today.  Food was super quick - received it at most 7 minutes after we ordered.  However, they should have taken longer, as the french fries were not cooked.  It wasn't a matter of them not being crispy on the outside, they were actually raw in the middle.

Had the caribbean chopped salad with mango dressing - it was OK.  The red peppers were raw, not roasted as advertised, and the chicken was supposed to be marinated and grilled, but it was tasteless and had zero signs of being grilled."}
{"text":"Got there for happy hour took some effort to get a drink and a menu. Had to ask for it and it wasn't that busy. Ordered pizza and wings the pizza wasn't all the way cooked. Our bartender didn't check on us we had to get her attention every time to order anything. After being there an hour the bartender finally started talking to us, and she was nice."}
{"text":"So this was my second time at a Primanti Bros but I'm not sure my first one counted, since it was at their Fort Lauderdale location. Anyhow, as soon as we landed in Pittsburgh we looked up Primanti Bros and went to the closest location, which happens to be in Moon, PA, very close to the airport. We ordered the nachos and their Pastrami sandwich. The nachos were great, full of toppings and chili. The sandwich was quite tasty. The pastrami was buttery and perfectly salty. The mayo-less, but vinegary coleslaw works perfectly to cut the fat of the fries. I'm not sure why the portions have to be so big though. We ate the nachos for a while, but it still wouldn't fit into their biggest to-go box.
Overall, I would def be back for that sandwich. But I will probably starve for a few days beforehand to make sure I can finish it."}
{"text":"I'll be visiting Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving.  I can not wait.  Primanti Bros will be my first stop!  I love this location with all hipster looking people and laid back atmosphere.  The sandwiches are so good with the coleslaw and fries...It's junk food heaven.  And yes I can definitely appreciate some junk food.  I'll be there soon, until then...hugs&kisses."}
{"text":"Went there during my first trip to PA. Had a buffalo chicken sandwich and tater tots. Was DAMN GOOD. Went there again and I had a pizza, wasn't impressed at all. They didn't charge us for the pizza of course, I was disappointed"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and suggested to try Primanti as this is the Pittuburgh thing. 
I arrived here around 1:00pm, and the restaurant was very busy.  I was seated immediately at the bar, but it was very hard to get attention. 
I asked one of servers what he recommended, and he said Pitts-Burger was the most popular sandwich, so i decided to get it.
I waited about 20 minutes to get my sandwich. It was big. I had a bite and was very disappointed because the patty was overcooked and french fries are soggy.

The service wasn't good and the staff wasn't friendly at all.
I'm not sure this is located in downtown, the restaurant had a disgusting smell.
My expectation was too high overall. 
I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hype about this place, and I honestly don't see why.

Every seat was full when we walked in, but we were able to grab the last 2 seats at the bar. The servers were friendly and quickly got us some local beer and took our orders. We started with the tater tots, and they were by far the best part of the meal. Crispy and delicious. Served with a horseradish sauce. Yum. Then the lunch quickly slipped downhill. I ordered the Salami and Cheese sandwich which came with almost no meat or cheese (less than 10% of contents). The fries just tasted like a mush of plain potato and made up at least 50% of the sandwich. The cole slaw was tasteless (20% of sandwich). The bread was fresh, but there was just too much of it (20% of sandwich). Nothing was seasoned or salted, and everything about the sandwich was bland and boring. I even salted, peppered, and added hot sauce to my food, but nothing helped. This was a very inexpensive meal considering the portion size, but even so, it was not worth the price.

Sorry Primanti Brothers, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious one of a kind sandwiches, food comes out fairly quick, good service, clean restaurant, and friendly staff. I have been here numerous times and have had very few problems. Food is priced well and they always have drink/food specials. Its obviously not the original but it is a great family restaurant in Monroeville and is the closest, best location otherwise."}
{"text":"Wow. I may never be allowed in Pittsburgh again. I just straight up wasn't impressed by this sandwich. I went halfsies on a pastrami and cheese and their Pitts'burger' which is like a long cheeseburger between slices of bread. All sandwiches are suggested to come with the works: slaw, tomatoes and fries. (Fries are inside the sammy).

First of all, quality just wasn't there for me. The fries were super soggy, the bread is like a soft white bread, the kind where your fingers make imprints upon touching and the thing was all slaw. The pastrami was ok (my man liked it much more than I did) and the Pitts'burger' was definitely a let down, all I tasted was that slaw and bread. It was cheap for 3 sandwiches the meal rang up to to $21 and some change but, I, who never leaves a plate empty left half of a sammy behind. 

Looking back I bet the colossal fried fish sandwich would be banging with the combo of slaw and that white bread but for the other sandwiches, they were just nothing special. I wouldn't recommend as a place to try when visiting Pittsburgh and friends in Pittsburgh, no offense but, come to NJ and I'll show you a sammy.

* Cash Only.
** Open 24 hours - which is pretty awesome, I'll give it up."}
{"text":"When told I was taking a trip to Pittsburgh, many family members and friends only gave me one piece of advice -- go to Primanti Bros!

On the evening that we did (a Friday), it was fairly busy; a long line out the door almost turned us away, but it didn't take too long for us to get a seat. We ended up getting a spot at the bar.

I really liked the style of the restaurant, and was so eager to try a sandwich for myself. I ended up ordering the Ham and Cheese, which arrived stuffed with cole slaw and french fries in addition to the meat. Holy cow. I'd seen photos of their sandwiches of course, but getting to have the real thing was quite the experience.

Normally food that size is overwhelming for me, but I dove right into that thing and devoured most of it. I was surprised with how well the sandwich itself stayed together, considering how much is pressed between two thick slices of bread. 

We did have to wait a good while to get our check, which is my only real complaint, but I understand that it was a super busy Friday dinner. I would still highly recommend giving this place a try if you haven't been before, but maybe not too frequently for those who live in the area. I mean, a weekly diet of meat, fries, and cole slaw probably isn't that good for you. Sure is delicious though!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Primanti Bros after nine hours of driving, excited to try one of these giant sandwiches that I've heard about. This was a good place to catch the end of the NBA Finals game, but the Pitts-Burger & Cheese was just ok. The beef was really bland, and there was nothing special about the cole slaw. The fries that they used for the sandwich were very good. I just started pouring on the hot sauce to make it better. I will say: the fact that this location is 24 hours makes me appreciate it far more. While the burger was average for sober Kamron, I could see this as an ideal spot for Pittsburghers after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros is a staple in our house!. It is very true, you either love them or hate them.  We LOVE them.  I have even gone so far as to try to make my own at home. We have been eating Primanti's since the early 70's when the only place I knew of at the time was the strip district. Then several more popped up in all the right places. I am not as fond of the restaurant style they have now moved into, I still like the quick shop for a sandwich. The restaurant don't offer the quick service that the small sandwich shops do. It is nice to have a choice when you have kids with you.  The North Versailles is my least favorite, but it is the closest. The service is good here, but time from taking order to receiving isn't all that great. Monroeville isn't bad, either, slow service.  I still prefer the Strip District. They closed my favorite on Cherry Way, downtown, for a more of restaurant location in Market Square, just isn't the same.  The location in Oakland on campus is hard to get to when you can't find a parking space.  For the most part we have received a good sandwich, every now and then the bead was cut to small or the slaw was to over powering. For the most part it has been consistent. We have never had other restaurant foods either than the sandwiches. I have been meaning to try the pizza fest, but not as of now.  
Something about the fries and slaw on the sandwich makes it for me. I like the Genoa & Cheese, The Roast Beef and the Pastrami.  Other family members have gone for the When Pigs Fly.  I do like trying the new creations for the Penguins. 

One of our newest locations is Ft Lauderdale which is in another post. I am looking forward to trying the new restaurant in the Waterfront in Homestead."}
{"text":"Glorious sandwich, atmosphere and neighborhood. I spent one hour in Pittsburgh, all of it here, and if I make it that way again, this will be my first stop. It's not an all-time great meal like the reputation led me to believe, but it's an excellent sandwich nonetheless."}
{"text":"Would a stop in Pittsburgh really be a stop in Pittsburgh if I didn't stop into Primanti Brothers to have a sandwich?  Absolutely NOT.

I swear, we landed, checked into the hotel, and then immediately went to the first Primanti Brothers we saw and ordered their #1 and #2 best sellers.  #2 is their cheesesteak and #1, very appropriately so, is BEER.  

This particular location is quite spacious.  You can sit downstairs, you can sit at the counter and watch them make their famous sandwiches, or you can sit upstairs.  The waiters are really cool and so nice.  I could tell I was no longer in New York any more.

I ordered the #2, which is their philly cheese steak sandwich.  Unlike a traditional cheese steak, this one comes in the form of a patty, and in true Primanti form, it came loaded with french fries, coleslaw ( which is made without mayo, just salt, pepper, and vinegar), and tomatoes, crushed between two pieces of thick italian bread.  

We also ordered their chili fries, which was smothered with chili sauce, bacon, and cheese and topped with two ice cream sized dollops of sour cream. 

The sandwich lived up to its name.  I ate almost all of it, except for a handful of fries, but that is only because I ate so much of the chili fries beforehand.

It was a really cool experience and I can now rest in peace because I finally tried this sandwich that has been advertised and taunting me on the Food Network for so long.

I came, I conquered the Primanti Sandwich.  It was a proud moment in my life."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We won't be back. 

We ordered their burger - the 2nd most popular thing on the menu. The meat was grey and tasted boiled. No browning at all. Blah, tasteless. The fries which were supposed to be award winning were limp and tasted only of cold potato. Cold slaw was good but there was just a smidgen on the sandwich.

But worst part was the service. While each of the waitresses were friendly they couldn't do they're job. Service took forever. They never brought us silverware so we just ate with our hands. We were going to order dessert but they just flew by and dropping the check on the table. 

It was so noisy that we couldn't talk to the person directly across the table. We walked out instead realizing there were too many other places to try to ever go back."}
{"text":"A long wait at 5:30 pm on a Saturday and lots of hype raises one's expectations. This considered, the fish sandwich was still pretty damn good!  I am not one to go for a sandwich that consists of buttered toast, fried fish, cheese, cole slaw, and french fries. My husband recommended it and I figured I'd give it a go.  Delish!  You look at this thing and think \"should I? I shouldn't. But I will.\"  And then you are happy that you did.  On a practical note, there are plenty of tables in the square, so if they're busy I recommend taking your food to go and sitting there."}
{"text":"Pastrami, fries AND coleslaw in a sandwich?! What more do you want? It was like a party in my mouth with all the great flavors without being too greasy or over seasoned.  Goes perfect with some hot sauce by the way."}
{"text":"Primantis is the ideal Pittsburgh sandwich. Fries, coleslaw, provolone, whatever meat you'd like in between the famous mancinis bread. I love this location especially because of the hours. Living downtown it's hard to find places to eat late at night but the market Sqaure primantis is open till 12 o'clock 7 days a week. I've tried variations of the sandwich but my favorite so far is the pastrami. I went tonight and I'll be back again the near future."}
{"text":"Normally I really enjoy their food. I have gotten salads, pizza, sandwiches, etc. It's all been fairly good!! Tonight I ordered garlic parm wings, and celery with ranch to go. I received the celery, no ranch. The wings had almost no flavor. Pretty much just fryer flavor. Slight hint of garlic, zero parm on the wings at all. Also, they were some of the smallest wings I've ever seen. Very disappointing. It is a pain to get in and out of this location for me, so I didn't want to have to go back about this. But I probably won't order takeout here again."}
{"text":"Not personally impressed with this sandwich but I respect it.
The sandwich has \"potatoes\" (aka fries) on it, and a heaping mound of 'slaw - these fixins alone makes the trip and wait to get in worth it to some. I respect this sandwich because it wasn't too salty, heavy, or greasy - considering.
The meat/cheese ratio is actually on the lighter side, the slaw is vinegar based (not mayo), and the fries are less than a side order portion. 
The \"white bread\" is cut from an Italian loaf. 
I am just used to better sandwiches - this one was just subpar."}
{"text":"When asked, \"where should I eat in Pittsburgh?\" Everyone always mentions Primanti Bros Sandwiches. My experience was ok. I had the Genoa Salami Sandwich. With a Primanti bros sandwich you definitely need a juicy meat, the Genoa salami didn't quite cut it. It made the sandwich dry and I had to add sauce to make it juicy and more flavorful. The service was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I had heard about Primanti Bro's from Man vs. Food and had a few friends from Pitt recommend it for my family. I thought the idea was fabulous and had to give it a shot during a trip down in that area. I have to say that I was quite disappointed with the experience. 

I ordered a Roast Beef and thought that it came out quite flavorless. Although I love meals with massive portions, this sandwich didn't really have a clear way to attack it. It was overstuffed with french fries and ended up just being a spilled mess of fries on my plate. The idea of a sandwich stuff with slaw and fries sounds great in theory until you take a bite and realize how dry and flavorless those fries make it. I liked the slaw - it had a nice sweet taste, but would have preferred a quarter the number of fries so that I could actually enjoy some flavor. Otherwise I felt like the sandwich needed to be smothered in some sort of sauce.

I also felt that there was much to be desired with the restaurant staff. They weren't unfriendly to us, just indifferent and slightly socially retarded. Despite the objections that my pals from Pitt have thrown at me, I won't be going back to Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today.  Waitstaff was excellent.  An Italian sandwich and fries came to $11.  The Italian sandwich did not include fries so they were a side order.  I was very disappointed in the sandwich.  They put baloney on the sandwich instead of ham.  This is NOT disclosed on the menu!  Way too expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"THIS IS WHAT PA IS ABOUT !!!
    LOVE THIS PLACE !!!  Best place to eat in PITTSBURGH !!
  French Fries are thick and the sandwich w/ the works is the bomb !!!"}
{"text":"On my day to trip to visit Pitts, I was told this is a must visit! I went with the guys suggestion which was cappicola and egg. The sandwich came out with fries on it!?!? Weird but it worked. The sandwich looks impressive at first but then you realize it's just a lot of bread. I had a hard time getting \"slapped\" with flavor. I would assume that if there were more topping or less bread it would be more impressive. Meh"}
{"text":"I don't know why there seems to be so much hate for this place. From how it was explained to me, Primanti Bros. isn't necessarily famous for the quality of the food, but rather for it's culinary place/purpose in the history of Pittsburgh. I know it's probably hard to separate one's own experience from expectations raised from the Food Network hype, but this place is, and always will be, just a place that serves over the top, greasy, heart attack inducing grill food.  If you're coming here because you saw this place on a list, you're probably going to be disappointed.  

Seeing the grill, the shabbiness of the establishment, and reading over the menu helped to manage my expectations pretty quickly.  It's a greasy spoon restaurant, plain and simple.  Thankfully I have a soft spot (probably several soft spots with the amount of times I visit places like this) for grilled and fried monstrosities.  I think a mistake that people probably make is reading on the menu that the 'Pitts-burger' is the #2 seller (after #1, beer), and subsequently ordering it with the thought that #2 ='s 'best thing on menu'. This is probably a HUGE mistake Primanti Bros. makes by advertising it.  Our waitress, who was certainly an incredibly friendly oversharer (read:  brutally honest) said that she didn't really care for the Pitts-burger compared to other burgers around the city that she's eaten, despite it's popularity.  She actually gave us her top 3 menu recommendations, and we ordered those instead.  I ate the pastrami and cheese sandwich, which I thought was very tasty.  I had never had fries and coleslaw IN a sandwich, and the flavor was different than what I was expecting. I washed it down with a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, which I was happy to see they had on tap.  The prices for everything were all very reasonable for a 'tourist trap'.

Do I think this is the best food I've ever eaten?  Not even close.  But I do think it's near the top of the pecking order for greasy spoon dives."}
{"text":"Had their best seller for food and I would grade it a 1 out of 5 while service was a 4 out of 5. French fries were barely warm and the entire sandwich was unseasoned. The meal was definitely not light. However the server was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"It's the best sandwich with French fries. If you like cornbeef this is the best spot in pgh"}
{"text":"Primanti's Pleasant Hills location had great service, and the food was awesome!   The only place I know where the sandwiches actually look like the pictures!!!   And their drinks are superb - try the Drunk Duck - delicious plus it comes with a little drunk duck on its side.   The pizzas are good too - plenty of toppings and fresh dough crust !   The Smallman Street Fries are loaded !    Great place to eat !"}
{"text":"Our server olia was very friendly throughout the madness of market square tonight.  The sandwiches were great, fresh Italian bread, fresh slaw, lots of meat and toppings.  Parking does suck down here though."}
{"text":"Service is usually pretty fast in the beginning greeting you and getting the food, then they kind of take their time getting refills and the check to you.  Food is good during the day except watch at night sometimes they dont change the fryer oil and your fries come out pretty burnt or funky late night. (After 9 or 10). Drinks are excellent!!"}
{"text":"This location has great servers!   We got Bri and she was friendly and checked on us often, we didn't have to wait long for our food at all and the portion sizes were great !  I do wish we had a little more sauce for the O'Rings but the sandwiches were great.    You must try their Drunk Duck - it is delicious and refreshing on a hot day - a great drink for lunchtime!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows that that if you go to Pittsburgh, you go to Primanti Bros. (My friends and I were in town for a Pirates/Phillies game, and the PNC Park Primanti Bros was packed the entire game.) We visited the Market Square location, and if you eat on the patio, it's a fun place to hang out and drink some Iron City beers. 

 I got the Black Angus Sandwich. It was quite large, cut in half, and brought on a piece of wax paper. As it turned out, I'm pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better. It was really, really, not good. I did eat the first half, but the bread was so tasteless, I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely. Because you know, people being rude is hilarious. 

So I guess if you want an authentic Pittsburgh experience then go here. But if you want actual decent food, avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would! Usually I love coming here but Tuesday night my husband and myself went and the bartender that was working was so rude. We waited forever for her to even acknowledge us and when she finally did she was just nasty. She had such a bad attitude that we didn't even stay we ended up giving the menus back and going elsewhere for dinner. Find a new job if you don't want to deal with people!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite place to go.  Food is great and a part of pittsburgh.  The place can get busy and food can take longer but overall never a bad experience."}
{"text":"Trying really hard, but just not what it once was before opening 42 more locations. 42? Yup. The slide started when the Oakland location opened and you may as well stop in at any other national chain as here. It's a familiar model:

1. Add locations based on a really good idea and a fabulous reputation. 

2. Water down that reputation with inconsistent quality across stores and cutting costs to enhance profitability.

3. Remove the heart and soul of the dining experience. In this case by spreading something that was uniquely Pittsburgh across Pennsylvania and into 6 other states.

Once as much a Pittsburgh icon as our sports teams and bridges, visiting Primanti's is now more of a 'said I did it' than the unique eating experience it once was. Might as well go to Applebees."}
{"text":"I was recently in Pittsburgh with a friend and we were told we should try Primanti Bros.  First thing we did after checking into our AirBrB was go here.  We were prepared for this place to suckkkk because you know how it is when places get hyped right. 

I was actually pleasantly surprised at my experience.  My meal was definitely good and resulted in the toughest decision I've ever had to make about rating a place 3 or 4 stars.  Continue reading for more details.  

We got there on a Monday afternoon and it was packed out.  Service was slowwww as hell because it was so busy.  I asked the dude for his recommendation and he said go with the Pastrami.  I was like aigghttt.  We also got an order of Chili Fries.  

Damn, the Chili fries kind of suckeddd.  The fries were aight but the chili was like mad watery and just didn't go well with the fries.  The chili needs to be thicker and meatier for the fries to soak up.

The sandwich was pretty huge (we didn't order double meat) and was interesting because it has a bunch of stuff in it, like fries and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was surprisingly really good.  Honestly when I looked at my sandwich, I asked why there was so little meat on it.  But when I bit into it, it was sufficiently meaty.  Could have used a bit more though. 

I don't remember how much I paid but I think it was like $8 a sandwich and around $4.39 for the chili fries.  I might be wrong though.

All in all, I really enjoyed the sandwich.  It stood out nicely even with the negatives I mentioned so far.  As I pondered my rating, I concluded that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts in this case.  If I go another time, I'd probably order another sandwich (without fries) and ask for double meat ($2 extra).  

On a side note, Pittsburgh as a city kind of sucks.  We went on the dooshbag incline, which was pretty aight.  The Cathedral of Learning was the best part of our trip; that place is gangsta."}
{"text":"I am currently a Manta Ray. I float around like a carpet or an oversized kite on the ocean floor. But before I was a Manta Ray, I'd come here for sandwiches, often. Remember, I'm talking about Pre-Manta. ;)

First hand experience:

I've been to this Primanti's maybe 7 times, including the first time I was ever playing shows in Pitt, and then the next 2-3 times because I didn't know any better, and then I've taken some friends here including a barbie doll girl not too long ago. None of my guests were any more impressed by it than myself, so I'm sticking with a 4 star, sorry all.

Their food is just... it is good, it's just not amazing... I dunno. i don't get it. I do like it but there is something missing. It's a Pitt legend though. Don't ask them what the best seller is. The Cheesesteak is the #2 seller. Always get an egg on top of your sandwich.

An update on this to tell you that, while this isn't the friendliest place in the world, there is a kind of charm to their abrasiveness that makes you feel like you're at home. They don't seem to like you using the bathroom (it's in a nightspot, go figure). The great thing is that they are genuinely 24 hours and will make you anything at any time of day.

I have to admit the food is a bit more bland than other local Pittsburghese specialties along similar lines (like Peppi's). Having said that, I would recommend that everyone and their mother try eating there at least once, for three reasons. (1) It's the most famous eatery in Pitt. (2) A lot of people swear by it, so you might love it even though I don't. And (3) there is absolutely nothing in the world I have ever tried, that is similar to Primanti's sandwiches. They are, for lack of a better phrase, an entity unto themselves.

Another sticking point I have is the price. It's just too high for what it is and how busy they are. But then again, you do get a whole ton of food.

The only thing weirder than Primanti Bros, is that there is a Primanti Bros outside Pittsburgh. There are actually several, and they're all... yes, you guessed it. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I know, I know, that sounds weird. But look at it this way. If you had to pick ten large cities in America that did not have their own \"local\" flavour of food, Ft. Laud might be one of them, right? And if you had to guess where all the hot Italians in Pittsburgh go when they want to lay on a beach and get warm, you might guess Ft. Laud right? Well, perhaps that explains it then. Except that Primanti Bros is now not only the famous late night eatery in Pittsburgh.... it is also the most famous in Ft. Laud!

Plus the Ft Laud version has better scenery in all sorts of ways. To be honest Pittsburgh girls are probably as gorgeous as South Florida girls (probably the same girls on vacation?), but the difference is they're wearing different outfits because the weather is different... you might say. And the Ft Laud location is literally across from the beach. The very same beach that, on my first ever visit to Ft. Laud, I had an intimate encounter on, with a lovely girl. I got a ticket from the police during that encounter, but not for making love... for leaving the car parked illegally at 3am while going down onto the beach to do aforementioned activity. Sorry, was that too much information?

However, whereas in Pittsburgh I'd say, give it a try (the sandwich, not the sex, although that could be fun too)... if you're in Ft. Laud, do yourself a favour... drive to Miami, and try what is undeniably the best Cuban food in the United States... See my top lists for more on that.

PS
I don't think Primanti's Permeate's my fave sandwiches list. For that reason I'm renaming it Permeate's. And if you come in here when all the Pitt frat boys are drunk, then it's more like P*nis's. Or perhas Pre-Pubescent's. In terms of levels of maturity anyway.

Still, it's better than The O - Original Hot Dog Shop. Don't read my review for that place. Trust me."}
{"text":"Went to Pittsburgh for the first time to attend the Steelers/Patriots game.  A colleague is a Pittsburgh native and told me Primanti Bros is a MUST - plus Ive known about this legendary place for years.  I got the steak, and while the meat was GREAT, Im just not a fan of the sandwich with the fries and the cole slaw.  The slaw is vinegar based rather than mayo based and I didnt like the taste of it.

The ambiance of this place was cool to watch the other games before we headed to Heinz Field.  I would come back to try some of the other sandwich offerings w/o the slaw & the fries.

SIDE NOTE:  The dude with the light eyes (Avery, I think) from Greys Anatomy was standing in line behind us (we were sitting at the counter) and when I realized who he was I asked if it was him.  He slowly responded and said Yes like he was trying to be undercover.  I asked if I could take a pic with him and he said after he ate - PSSSHHHHHHHHH, NOT!!!  Its not like youre Idris Elba homeboy, Im good on that.  Later at the game, I saw him on the big screen as he started the waving of the Terrible Towels.  Meh... probably not even a Steelers fan."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while, but not much has changed. Styrofoam cups, wax paper for sandwiches, the menu is on the wall. This place has become a Pittsburgh landmark and is still worth visiting when in the Strip District!"}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype.  The sandwich was \"ok\".  The wait staff was friendly, and the beer choices are great!  I was expecting that a regular helping of meat on the sandwich would be overwhelming, that to order double meat would have been way too much food, but now I'm thinking a double meat sandwich would just barely cover it.  It all tasted good, I was just expecting more from my friends who swear up and down Primanti Brothers is \"the sandwich\".  

The fried pickles were awesome!  I'd go back, but I think I got sold a story more than a sandwich."}
{"text":"We stopped here as soon as we landed in Pittsburgh. This was suggested to us by a Pittsburgh native. We were very satisfied with the food we ordered and with the service we received. Although this place is more like a bar I would take children, but only during the day. It doesn't seem like a place to take children at night. 

For starters we ordered the fully loaded nachos. This came with chili, cheese, jalapeños, salsa, and sour cream. It was $7.95 and enough to feed at least 5 people! The chili was very tasty and the salsa was fresh and had a little kick to it. 

We then ordered the chicken wings and had honey mustard sauce added into it. This was OK( but it could be because I was starting after a 6 hour flight) the wings came out burnt and it seems they just dipped the burnt wings into honey mustard sauce. 

My husband ordered the \"when pigs fly\" sandwich and he was really please. This sandwich was HUGE! It was enough to feed to starving adults (so I would half the order with someone). We also had some cheese fries with our order. The fries came out soggy and the cheese was like cheese from a can. Yuck! 

All in all my favorite was the nachos!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are tasteless. Smallman st fries were pretty good. This place is famous for some reason and I cannot figure out why."}
{"text":"Went here this past Saturday night at 7pm with the intent of having a few drinks with friends, getting some dinner, and watching the penguins game.     We sat at the booth for 30 minutes after our drink order was taken and never got our drinks.  We could see them sitting on the end of the bar getting watered down.   Never did see our waitress again after she took the drink order and the one other waitress that came around ignored us.     Also, for a Pittsburgh sports bar, only 1 tv had the pens game on.   A small tv facing the corner of the dining room.   We ended up walking out and spent our money at another establishment."}
{"text":"I know it's a Pittsburgh staple, and it is unique to say the least, but the Primanti Brother's sandwich was just ok in my book.  

A sandwich with slaw and fries, greasy and dripping.  The fries weren't very hot, nor crispy.  The slaw was standard.   Nothing was exceptional.  Their drinks were unlimited refill (nice) in a Styrofoam cup (interesting).  The food came out fast, the staff was very nice, but Primanti's just left something to be desired.  Maybe even though it was a mom and pop shop, it almost felt like a chain.  It lacked that neighborhood feel.

Don't forget to check out the restrooms.  I felt like I was off to the dungeons!  

Check it out once, but I don't think I really need to come back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious we had the Smallman St. fries chili, cheese sauce, bacon, pickled jalapeños, and sour cream. Delicious!!!  and a colossal fish & cheese . We got here just in time after our order was finished there was a power outage and we're eating in the dark !! Lol lol hilarious."}
{"text":"Was very good - but could be 100 times better. Had the steak and cheese and the kilbasa and cheese. The problem is that the coleslaw lacks salt - it needs a lot more salt. And, the fries are not well done enough... if they were cooked a bit more and has some crispy bits to them, the sandwiches would be phenomenal..."}
{"text":"Not the same. Original location is the best obviously, but this is the worst tasting suburban location. Pizza wasn't bad but is far behind other locations I have been to . My go to sandwich is pastrami with egg. I decided to get a double meat pastrami and egg sandwich, the meat is tasteless. I bit into it and immediately disappointed. No matter how much hot sauce I put on this , it won't help... I'm not even going to call and complain because it's only $10 I don't care. If you are in the area just drive to harmarville , much better."}
{"text":"I eat Primanti's every time I'm in Pittsburgh. Happened to have two days off while here for work and ate here for the second time today. Their fires are properly made, hand cut and always fresh. I suggest trying the Ragin' Cajun. It's got the perfect amount of kick, and with the slaw they compliment each other perfectly."}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour for 2 measly sandwiches and 2 beers this place is for you. Wtf!"}
{"text":"While this place gets high reviews for the unusual, decadent, over-the-top sandwiches, I was sorely disappointed by the meager amount of corned beef in my sandwich. I ended up taking the meat out of one side and adding it to the other and not eating the other half. Not sure I would return -- too many other interesting cuisines to investigate."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are fine. Service, not so much. No one will take the time to explain to you that you're supposed to seat yourself, then someone will come take your order and deliver the food, but won't bring the check. Wait staff wasn't very friendly, seemed to be annoyed we were there. Not very clean."}
{"text":"The best part about Primanti's is that it's always the same no matter which location you're at, and always delicious. This specific location in Lebo gets it right every time! They have a really awesome beer selection too, because you cannot have that slaw, meat and potato deliciousness without washing her down with a cold beverage! Really good happy hour specials too. Btw, they do have other items on the menu besides their sandwiches but I could never, just no, not into anything besides what they're known for!"}
{"text":"The strip is a must stop for any tourist visiting Pittsburgh. Primanti's is a legend so we had to stop for lunch. The sandwich was delicious as was the chili. The place is dumpy but the service was quick."}
{"text":"Awwww yeaaah! 

Awesome service, awesome sammiches, cheap!

And we met some Cubs players there."}
{"text":"Definitely a must when you're in the Pittsburgh area. This place is set up to represent the city of Pittsburgh, with good food served by good people at a good price point. I got the vegetarian option (the deluxe egg/cheese) and it hit the spot--and was surprisingly flavorful with the different sauces. The people I was with loved the options they got, and everyone left full (and possibly ready to take a nap). I'm personally a big fan of fries on anything, but as a heads up, the fries can get a bit soggy over time. 

Overall, as someone who's never had a huuuge craving for sandwich, i was pleasantly surprised by the great service and comfort food!"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh Staple.  And apparently not just for tourists.

I have been to Pittsburgh a few dozen times. and almost every time, a stop at the original Primanti's on 18th St in the Strip District is a must.

Seeing how the reviews and pics have piled up here I feel I might be a bit redundant to say how awesome it is.  A one of a kind experience and sandwich goes without saying.  So let me talk about the personalities there for a quick minute.

The sandwiches as you see in the pics come on a piece of waxpaper.  That's it.  No utensils, no plates, just a squeeze bottle of ketchup and a piece of waxpaper.  So needless to say with the massiveness of these beasts, a mess is inevitable  A quick look at the napkin holder to grab as many as you can before anyone else at your table does, only to realize it's empty.  \"Miss, our napkin thing is empty, can we get some more?\" .... In a monotone voice, & an obviously not so thrilled manner, she replies \"They get filled once a day, before we open.  If they are empty, they are empty.\"  And then walks away as if we weren't even there.  

All we had to do was steal some from another table, but still, pretty funny.

Another time a small, clearly Italian man tosses our sandwiches at us, toothpick hanging out of his mouth, he says \"there yas go.\"  Now I know \"yas\" is a NY thing, and \"yinz\" is the Pittsburgh thing, but this was definitely a \"yas\".  

\"Excuse me sir, can we get a couple of forks?\"

In his best Chico Marx impression, he replies, \"What-cha gonna do witha fork?\"  And walks away.

Classic.

Wrap up;

A must!  Only gets 4/5 however, because as good as the food is, you can't help but leave there feelin pretty awful!"}
{"text":"Just not good at all.

I dig Primanti's.  I dig the tradition, that they are the local food of Pittsburgh (aka my city away from my city), I get that surly is the attitude the wait staff is supposed to have, I totally get it, and as I said I dig it.

I am not sure the people at this location get it however.

Miserable is the only word I would use to describe the staff.  There were maybe 10 tables packed waiting for food, and the staff must've thought that meant it was ok to take 45 minutes to make our sandwiches.  

In 45 minutes I literally could've gone in the back, made them, brought them out, ate them, and then perhaps got 2nds.  

Also when the waitress brought our food out, she was holding the sandwiches in a stack against her shirt, so all our food was getting all over her, and she didn't seem to care.  I guess a tray would've been too easy.

It also feels as if this location is more bar than restaurant, which is cool, and also what Carson St is mostly about anyways, so it should fit in.  Just don't call it Primanti's then.

And when the OG in the strip has a line around the corner, and I am with a couple of people who haven't had a Primanti's and want to experience it for the 1st time, this is the nearest option, their reactions said it all... \"Never again.\"  

And I totally get that as well.

Check the original in the strip, if it is super packed, skip it and save it for another time.  This place will ruin it for you.

Plenty of other places in the Burgh to eat and eat well at."}
{"text":"What can I say? This is a Pittsburgh classic. Pittsburgh wouldn't be complete without it and I hope I never see it go."}
{"text":"Very accommodating to large groups. Had to wait a little too long for refills, and food in general. Luckily, the food is worth it. (Honey buffalo wings, and steak salad) Hat off to the bartender, the drinks are made well!"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh institution. delicious sandwiches piled with french fries and coleslaw.  every part of the sandwich is delicious and it would be great separately but when you pile them all together it makes one of the most delicious things you'll ever eat. 

Wash it down with an Iron City and experience Pittsburgh at its best."}
{"text":"Very nice interior...updated rustic feel.  Service is solid and polite - especially for a primantis.  overall its a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"My first stop in the Strip District was the famous Primanti Bros., a chain of sandwich shops founded in 1933 in Pittsburgh. This is the original location. Its signature items are its sandwiches, which consist of grilled meat, an Italian dressing-based coleslaw, tomato slices, and French fries between two pieces of Italian bread.

I settled on pastrami, which was the original sandwich and a sweet tea. I'm not sure if you can tell but this sandwich is stacked! It's hard to get your hands around. The first bite is a bit of shock. Taking in all the tastes, including the slaw. It's different, but delicious, a winning combination for sure! The added fries give it more 'meat'.  I would eat here from time to time. It seems like a good hangover cure.

As I was leaving I ran into Toni. She saw me taking pictures and asked the couple I was sitting next to about me while I was in the restroom. She was waiting for me when I walked out, excited to hear about this girl from Nebraska. What a sweet little lady! Toni has been the manager at Primanti's for 40 years. She migrated here from Italy, which is pretty clear from her thick accent. She started working in a restaurant and became friends with the guy who now owns Primanti's. She said her favorite sandwich is also the pastrami and as far as the 'fame', she doesn't care. \"It's all about making the money.\" She also told me that out of all the famous foodies who have visited, that Bobby Flay is her favorite. \"He's my boyfriend!\"

The original shop is located in Pittsburgh's Strip District, a narrow strip of land where the warehouses and produce yards are located. In the 1930s, the Strip was a very busy place. Truckers delivered their goods in the middle of the night and had to get back on the road quickly. So Primanti's designed their sandwich to be eaten with one hand, while the driver drove the truck with the other. By combining the sides with the sandwich, a Pittsburgh staple was born. Of course, the restaurant offers a slightly humorous take on it, offering the explanation that the Primanti brothers simply forgot the plates and forks one day. According to the restaurant, Joe Primanti, born in suburban Wilmerding, Pennsylvania, invented the sandwich during the Great Depression. His brothers, Dick and Stanley, later joined him. The Primantis opened their hole-in-the-wall restaurant at Smallman Street and 18th Street in the Strip District and served the late-night and early-morning workers who were unloading fish, fruits, and vegetables.

The restaurant was featured in an article in the August 2003 edition of National Geographic magazine.

The restaurant was mentioned on the April 21, 2008, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in an interview with president Barack Obama. Stewart suggested that Obama visit the restaurant for their \"great sandwiches\", which Stewart had enjoyed as a comedian on the club circuit. 

Primanti Brothers made the list of 1,000 Places to See Before You Die in the USA and Canada by Patricia Schultz. The original Primanti Brothers location was also one of the featured stops of Man v. Food host Adam Richman during the show's visit to Pittsburgh.

In 2012, another Adam Richman-hosted show, Best Sandwich in America, featured Primanti's during the Northeast-region episode."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite stops in the Pittsburgh. My wife and I were on a trip to see the city etc and stopped here on the way into town. 

The sandwiches are great. I really haven't anything else since I'm a tourist so I always have to get them when I stop by. Get it loaded, the slaw and the fries really bring the sandwich to life. Enjoy! 

The beer selection was also pretty awesome. Not only did they have a to-go cooler but they had a pretty good selection on the menu. Yuengilng was on tap! That's not something that I always get to enjoy either being from Michigan so I definitely had to get a tall one of those. 

The chips and queso were a little suspect but everything else was really good. One other thing that was spot on was the service. Not only did our server take good care of us but he was engaging in good conversation and advice for what to see around town while we were there."}
{"text":"Blasphemous to speak of Primanti Bros in a bad light in the City of Champyinz but . . . I don't like their sandwiches . .  . AT ALL. 

A heaping amount of nearly raw, soggy fries heaped onto a sandwich with bread barely large enough to contain its components. 

Nice idea, bad product.  Too bad it is the signature food item (except, perhaps,  Heinz ketchup) for my beloved Pittsburgh.  

I want to love Primanti Bros sandwiches, I just don't.  At all : ("}
{"text":"So this is a Pittsburgh instiitution??  Am so underwhelmed.  After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches), they came out cold - and I'm not just talking about the meat, lettuce, tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.  What a disappointment.  Head to DiBellas - much better service, subs and sandwiches."}
{"text":"In case you haven't heard of this place, this is one of those restaurants you must visit before you die.  They stack all their sandwiches with coleslaw and fries, and are known far outside of Pittsburgh, mainly because of all the publicity they have gotten on TV *cough* Man v. Food *cough*.

I had a cheese steak sandwich, I believe, and the flavors of the fries and coleslaw just didn't go well with the cheese steak.  However, they have Yuengling, which is my favorite beer not available in Ohio (my home state).  Yuengling goes well with anything.

The individual ingredients were okay.  The cheese steak tasted nothing like what a cheese steak SHOULD taste like; it was more like a hamburger than a steak.  The fries were moist but not too moist, although I ended up liking the coleslaw the best.  It can get a little messy, though, so you might need a napkin.  Or twelve.

I had somebody tell me that I should have gotten a capicola sandwich after I told them about my trip there.  Considering how the slaw and fries were, that would have probably been a better choice.

The place is always packed, so make sure you are patient with finding a spot to sit and to park.

Overall, this was okay, but not perfect."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Bound!  Part XI

(For Part X, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/F9IJ3EddoyW89O0DFikPTQ/review/D5UPfn_UbOm4iqfWgSRygw?fsid=X4Q_wJ-wTj91tUUZ_DA3Eg)

Where to begin.  Primanti Brothers is an institutional staple in the Pittsburgh area.  The restaurant is famous for their sandwiches that are smothered with French fries and coleslaw.  Originally created as a whole meal-in-one for the truck drivers making early morning deliveries to the Strip, Primanti's sandwiches have since become a local go-to for tourists and has been featured on several Travel Channel and Food Network programs. 

Let me impart a little local knowledge here.  The sandwiches suck.  My parents have always hated Primanti's and I've had a hit or miss experience over the years, so I had to convince her that we needed to give it one more shot.  We stood in line to get in (which pissed my mom off to no end) and when we finally sat down, the sticky table didn't leave the best first impression.  

Our waiter arrived and we ordered two capicola and cheese's.  Although the prodigal sandwich was, as usual, dry and salty, it also had overwhelming flavor undertones of 'waste of money', and 'overrated'.  

I've had friends visit who felt it some sort of rite of passage to indulge in salty mediocrity, and I can see how people outside of Pittsburgh would find French fries and coleslaw on a sandwich a KA-RAAAZZZY premise, but Primanti's isn't anything special and in no way worth bypassing the plethora of amazing restaurants the city has to offer.  

(For Part XII, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/DGeupkmvo1X1oKn-sv9UQA/review/-HJfUYS0E_OklNDSFkWfbQ?fsid=FL_7zkBe4MUwc2VCDFMFNA)"}
{"text":"Dude. A meal on Mancini Bros. bread. Not much to say, except I'll have to book more trips to Pittsburgh to eat here again! Definitely a good way to gear up for or finish a night of drinking. The cooks were hilarious and only added to the post debauchery atmosphere. The fries and slaw on the sandwich are something I will absolutely have again. Go. Do it. If you can."}
{"text":"Low brow

Gross concoction 

No appeal whatsoever 

Yinzers with no standards like this place"}
{"text":"Straight up, this is the way to make a sandwich. Big hunks of fresh bread, all the toppings on the inside, and a really great price. I love this location in particular because it's the original, the dive, where everything is made right there amidst the delicious grease and darkness instead of in some sterile chain-restaurant kitchen. Somehow everything comes out better and tastes better here. I got a free double-meat coupon for joining their mailing list, and I put it to good use last time I visited here. I can see why single meat might seem kinda skimpy, because with the fries and slaw right there on the bread, they can overwhelm the main feature, but with double meat you get to taste everything in every bite. I also opted for chili fries as an appetizer this time, and was rewarded with a huge basket of fries (this is a two-person appetizer MIN.) covered with chili that puts anything in Cincinnati to shame. (Texas will still massacre anyone else's chili, but I'm talking about Cinci-style runny chili here, not the meaty thick good stuff, and now I want to go back to Texas just writing this parenthetical statement.)

Tl;dr? Go here. Detour here. Visit Pittsburgh again, get downtown, and get yourself a huge sandwich with no apologies. Throw back a local brew if you like, watch the game if it's on, and eat up!"}
{"text":"A myth, a legend, and all all-out nostalgic fest. Eerily reminiscent of old school dives and diners which parade the highways of the east coast, which added even more to the charm.

Exceptional, salt-of-the-earth service from the folks that work there. And the sandwich lived up to all expectations. A classic, meaty taste that touches to the heart of Pittsburgh (or perhaps your literal heart, clogged arteries and all)"}
{"text":"Primanti's, oh the memories lol I love a good sandwich with fries and coleslaw! I always add egg! Ypu can't go wrong with egg lol 
This bar is your basic bar. It's clean with nice and friendly staff.  They have a nice selection of beers on tap and a good selection of liquor.  I would come here for a beer while already down here but I wouldn't come out of my way to come down here.  
There were a few patrons, of whom I would assume are locals and regulars, who reached into the bar and turned the music up and poured themselves their own water. Incredibly distasteful.  I would never do that!"}
{"text":"This location of Primanti's gets my vote because of their rocking happy hour (4-6 Monday through Friday).  1/2 off any alcoholic drink?   Cheap pizza by the slice?  Yes please!  I still am partial to the Kielbasa sandwich, which is more than enough for one person, but one day I am going to try that pizza.  For now, it's pretty awesome that I can get three Captain and Cokes plus the Kielbasa sandwich for $13 and some change.  Bar service is good, though it appears that they do a shift change around 5, so there is always a lot of shuffling around that time."}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh classic. I always ask for the french fries and the coleslaw on the side of the sandwiches even though most pittsburghers say that is not the way to eat their Sandwiches."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family and my husband had to try this place. We were in downtown on a kind of cool, rainy day and stopped in. The wait staff was kind of rude, particularly the host we encountered. We were a bigger group than they were really equipped to host (4 adults, a teenager, 2 kids, and a baby), but you would have thought I asked the host to clear the restaurant for us. We agreed to sit outside so we didn't have a wait and they were not happy having to move tables together or letting us sit by the heaters in an attempt to keep the kids warm. 

The food we got was okay, but not mind blowing. I got a sandwich and was excited about the concept, but was overall not impressed. Having slaw and fries in the sandwich on white bread led to it being kind of bland. It needed a lot of hot sauce, which was thankfully out on each table. 

We did get fries as a side/appetizer to keep the kids entertained, and they were tasty. The chicken fingers the kids got were absolutely delicious and I, honestly, would have preferred to eat those rather than my sandwich. 

I've been here once and don't know that I'd need to come back if I was in town again."}
{"text":"Just alright if that. Nothing special. My husband saw it showcased on the food channel or something close and so we tried it while in Pittsburgh. So, I got a turkey sandwich with the coleslaw and fries on it. Sounds interesting but the coleslaw was slightly bitter and I'm used to coleslaw being a little sweet. Too many fries on the sandwich. Trust me on this, there is a such thing as too much of a good thing. Oh, and like 2 slices of meat and a slice of cheese. I thinks it's overhyped."}
{"text":"There are very few restaurants that I get that 'craving' for, after a hard day's work. and this is one of them. Don't listen to these 'out-of-townies' saying it's just OK, they have a different palate; being from a different area. Western Pennsylvania cuisine is heavily influenced by Polish, German, and Pennsylvania Dutch; I can understand where it might not be the best for some. But for people like me who were raised on pierogies, haluski, and golumpki -- this place is amazing. Pair the #2 best seller with a Yuengling, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about primanti bros but was sadly disappointed. I was rather unimpressed by my sandwich. Ordered the turkey breast and cheese with an egg. The French fries were not seasoned or fresh. Also I wish they toasted the bread."}
{"text":"I guess this place is good to say you tried, but really the food is not that good. I got the fish sandwich it just wasn't good, not a lot of flavor, the coleslaw really didn't taste good, and frankly a fish filet at McDonald's tastes better.. good if you wanna say you went, not good if you want good food."}
{"text":"Iconic restaurant. Visiting from Houston. A must if in Pittsburgh. Go to the original. We shared a jumbo bologna sandwich and were still full. We removed some of the fries and Coke slaw so we could savor the bologna."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros. was on my list of places to stop for awhile now. Being a fan of the famous RUHUNGRY grease trucks in New Brunswick, NJ this place owed me an explanation.

And boy oh boy did they respond. I ordered two sandwiches so I could taste each one but I ended up eating the entire Jumbo Baloney and Cheese as well as the Cajun Chicken.

The bread was the big player on these sandwiches. Soft but firm enough to hold together the meat, cheese, slaw, fries, tomato, and onions (optional but worth it). If I had my choice between an RUHUNGRY fat sandwich or one of these, yikes! Sorry RUHUNGRY but The Primanti Bros. win this battle!

What's wrong with it? As with any overstuffed sandwich you will fall victim to an avalanche. I don't suggest you wear your tuxedo here nor bring a first date. A bib is recommended!

When I return to PA, you know I'll be back, jack!"}
{"text":"Must do in Pittsburg. This is the original location. I had the pastrami and my hubby have #2 which is the burger. The burger looks generic frozen burger that you can get in a box. But the pastrami was delicious. It was too much to eat but it was worth the try!"}
{"text":"Had to give it 5 stars just for the tradition it brings to the Burgh. Sandwiches and fries were great, very nice server and my son who is Pittsburgh obsessed was in 7th heaven. Yinz guys gotta go if your in the Burgh...."}
{"text":"Sort of a last resort place to eat due to the late hour.  Had a grilled steak salad which wasn't so great.  Not really any complaints about the service although it was what you would expect from a high school or college kid.  Not a problem with me though.  Very noisey place, so if you want quiet, or a good steak salad, don't pick here!"}
{"text":"This is my city!! Authentic Pittsburgh style sandwiches can be a feast for kings and Primanti Bros really know how to make 'em. The prices are great, especially for the amount of food you receive. A man's portion of meat slapped on two thick slices of Italian bread and topped with french fries and their signature Pittsburgh style vinegary coleslaw. I order another side of coleslaw and split it with my friend because it is that good and really compliments the meal. The sandwiches are the highlight of the menu but are graced with a classic variety of pub favorites, salads and an extensive bar menu. Primanti is a MUST SEE and should be one of the highlights of every trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Meh, this place was over hyped. I ordered the steak sandwich, which was supposedly the #2 most popular thing on the menu. I pile of soggy fries, a bland microwaveable \"beef\" pattie, some tomatoes and lettuce with white bread. I'd give it another chance, but definitely order something else. Prices are fairly cheap."}
{"text":"So many people recommending this to us and we ended up at this location based off of proximity to one of our museum stops. The experience did not start off well, but our food was ... decent. I didn't know this place was that \"famous\". I also didn't realize it was a chain until we typed the name into our yelp search. We got in line and there are two guys waiting outside who we get behind. We read a sign that says to wait outside until someone seats you. The guys are with their wives/girlfriends, who are in the incredibly small area in front of the podium. We were waiting for awhile about 5-10 mins. Apparently no one has helped them and they figure that a party of 4 won't get seated based off of a quick scan of the restaurant. When they leave they offer us luck and we stand in front of he podium. Still no one has even walked past us. On the podium is a sign that says - seat yourself- I don't think this is accurate because there are no seats and it's pretty busy how would anyone know we've sat down. However this is the only indication we've gotten about seating. So I walk through to try and find someone everyone is just rushing past I finally have manage to call out to a waitress (?) and ask her if we seat ourselves. She seems completely irritated that I would even think that. She walks over to the podium sees the sign - which is a two sided sign by the way - and hangs it on the wall in a huff with the side that says to wait to be seated. She says it'll be a minute. Now at this time there are three other parties behind us. Who would have not gotten seated because no one was attending podium or even checking to see if people are there. Some crowds leave and there is promise of a seat! Finally we get seated in an extremely tight seat and order. My family all ordered different sandwiches. They come with slaw and fries on top as well as tomatoes. I got the kielbasa, which flavor wise was really good. I opted for now tomatoes and added onions. Our waiter was nice and attentive a little quiet, but his niceness made up for our first experience. Maybe she wasn't the -hostess- and I'm sure she was overwhelmed. But she did not leave us with a great first impression. Anyway the food was - ehh. The bread wasn't anything special and it wasn't warm or anything. The rest of my sandwich just tasted cold when it came out. I guess because of the slaw. I feel like there could be a better way to prepare it. Overall my family enjoyed their sandwiches, I didn't. Maybe I needed a \"hotter\" meat, like a burger. If you want to stop at this famous sandwich place - maybe choose a different location? This one is close to the arena and downtown so it gets a lot of traffic and maybe that's why not everything was up to par. Oh and side note. The sandwiches don't come on plates - they come on that generic hoagie/sandwich paper and the waiters/waitresses just hold your open sandwiches in their flimsy paper all bundled up in their arms. And just slide it on the table. Very strange."}
{"text":"This is the location to go to for Primanti's. The location is spacious and clean, with plenty of seating. Because the kitchen is in the back, it doesn't have the oil-soaked feeling of the Oakland location. The wait staff is fast, friendly, and efficient, and always check on our party frequently. The menu is also larger; my wife can't help but order their pizza every time we visit.

The sandwiches are still good; bread, fries, slaw, meats. As I have said elsewhere, some of the meats are hit or miss; if you find a good one, like the kielbasa, get double meat and really have something great."}
{"text":"When you first come to Pittsburgh, everyone will urge you to go to Primanti's (or \"Primanny's\" in Yinzer). I think it was good, but not great, at this particular location.

The restaurant is kind of cramped and dirty, and it seems like there is a layer of grease on everything. The service is pretty poor at the counter, although in one visit an older man waited at our table and he was quite good.

The portions are generous, the sandwich bread is good, and the fries are very good. You really have to pick the right meats; the cheese steak meat is sub-standard, and a few of the others are less than stellar. But the cajun chicken, hot sausage, kielbasa, and others are very good. They make for big, messy, good sandwiches. The coleslaw is good as a sandwich topping, but doesn't really qualify as a slaw, as it is mostly vinegar soaked cabbage. It still goes well."}
{"text":"Where is the foodie culture in Pittsburgh? It's always surprising how few registered users there are in the city...

With that said, as a Pittsburgh native Primanti's is in the blood of the City. Sure, it may not be culinary glory, and it probably will give you an early heart attack, and it isn't  going to be the best-tasting sandwich you've had. But going to Primanti's is not about having \"the best food ever,\" but rather the Pittsburgh experience (hanging around natives, understanding the working-class roots of the town, and of course ordering the Second-best seller). And hey, the cheese-steak really isn't bad for what it is, and pretty unique with the slaw on! Though you may need to douse it with hot sauce or ketchup for extra flavor!"}
{"text":"I was trying to eat right and decided to go with a Paleo diet.   You ask what is a Paleo diet?  It is basically a diet made of nothing but meat and vegetables (no complex carbs or refined sugars).  

That lasted for about 12 hours.    When I crashed... I crashed HARD.  What did I do to crash so hard??? I went to Primanti Brothers.   I tried their sandwich with peppers, french fries, and cole slaw in between to huge pieces of Itallian Bread - Oh - I was not done...  Because my stretchy slacks are in style, I decided to try a piece of pizza with the gallon of beer that was on sale.

I guess I was eating like a survivor contestant just released from his sequester.

The pizza was amazing and cheap ($1.50 for a quarter of  a pie)
The sandwich was really good and filling.
The beer was on sale.

After said and done - my bill was $13 (yes that is correct - 2,000 calories for $13- that is maximizing my investment and destroys any buffett)..

I will go back but not jump out of a tree after my eating the leftside of the menu.

If you are in the area - try it out (give the pizza a shot - it is cheap!)"}
{"text":"As a born and raised Pittsburgher, I feel like it's a must for me to give Primanny's (as we yinzers say) a 5 star rating. If this is your first time visiting, I highly recommend visiting the original location in the Strip District as there's just something more magical about the experience. Take a walk around the place and admire all of the famous Pittsburghers from Mr. Rogers to Mario Lemieux. 

Pro Tip: Don't order your fries or slaw on the side, you might just get yelled at!

Any time I visit Primanti's, I always go with the # 1 and # 2 seller. Iron City Beer and a Pittsburgher (Steak) sandwich. If you're really hungry, add an egg. Don't forget to add the Red Devil hot sauce, as it completes the sandwich. 

It usually is packed on the weekends, especially on Steeler game day, but it's a pretty quick turnaround. Great sandwich, and great establishment!"}
{"text":"I love Primantis and this location has some characters working there. My only problem with this location is that their fries on the sandwiches almost always seem to be undercooked."}
{"text":"A true pittsburgh classic.  Had a salami and cheese, stacked with fries and coleslaw snd hubby had the pittsburgher.  Both very good and hot.  Great cold beer and wine.  Pirates on all tv's and great service!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at a Primanti Bros and it was awful.  Food is below mediocre.  Buffalo wings were gross, the chicken on the salad and pizza were low grade, looked like the cheap frozen type chicken.  I gave it a star because their fries were really good and the BLT tots.

As for our waitress, she seemed drugged out.  She was annoyed with serving us, she didn't set the drinks out but handed them to us (like getting irritated when we didn't grab them/notice fast enough)... she also put her hand out for us to return the menus to her... I'm not petty but if you're going to be a server it's the little things.  Her finger nails were dirty (if you're in food service clean nails/hands is important).  She also was rubbing her eyes and mouth/face, super disturbing hygiene for someone handling your food.

Over all I'm going to say try somewhere else in the Burgh!! Definitely do not reccomend"}
{"text":"I travel for a living and Pittsburgh favorite of mine! I try to make sure to eat there when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This one is a little overrated, basically just a bar/restaurant place similar to Chili's or AppleBees, nothing special. Food is just ok."}
{"text":"Everyone in here has a story.  Hard not to love this place.  We sat at the counter right in front of the grill where the real action and stories are.  I had the pastrami sandwich and  I would have given this place (5) stars but they do not season anything.  I know that because I watched.  I think these days, with so much emphasis on 'no this' and 'no that', they leave it up to the customers to season for themselves.  Dude!  Look at the sandwich--it's not the salt or pepper that will kill you.  I am not a salt freak.  I hardly ever add it to anything, but  I do understand seasoning and why the best tasting food is cooked with butter and salt. I do have one observation, as delicious as these sandwiches are (after seasoning for myself) there is not as much substance (meat) as a NYC deli sandwich.  That is because the thickness of the bread (superb) and fries (delicious) and slaw( spectacular) leaves not much room for anything else.
I loved this place, and would go back in a heartbeat.  The people in it were terrific, fun, colorful and the sandwich was delicious--but you need to season it with salt to bring out the true taste of how good these sandwiches are.  By the way. My blood pressure is 112/78 if you are wondering"}
{"text":"Got a sandwich to go so I can't give a full review but when I ate it, the fries were soggy and SOO greasy.  I had the bag in my purse and the grease leaked through and eventually broke the bag.  Really want to eat in there next time since everyones sandwiches looked yummy.

Their vegetable soup was great!  The people who work there are the best.  Amazing service."}
{"text":"Listen I have lived in southside for a couple years, and I go to primantis about once a week. They recently hired a woman with half a pony tail, half a buzz cut. (Will add a photo). My friend and I walked in, and asked for sandwhiches. She said \"you know you can go to the back of the building for food\" we replied \"can't we get food here?\". She says \"I guess\". After this encounter she completely ignored us for the rest of the night. I had to get my own ketchup and buffalo sauce from the BACK of the building (apparently the only place I'm allowed)."}
{"text":"I was told that this was a famous hot spot out here. Can't complain too much decent heavy sandwich of filled me up really quick. A little too much starches and carbs on a sandwich for me but I get it."}
{"text":"When you do not want an item on your sandwich - they act offended. Sorry - I am paying for it."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Pittsburgh, which is about once a year, I have to stop in and get a Primanti sandwich.  I have had about five different varieties and they are all good.  I was apprehensive at first about getting the cole slaw on the sandwich, because I'm not a big fan of cabbage or cole slaw, but it is a sweet and sour slaw that is different than any I've ever had and goes well with the sandwich.  The bread is what really makes the sandwich.  I know they get it from a local place, and it is so good.  The fries are always perfect.  Get an Iron City or a Yuengling to wash it down with and you have the perfect meal.  This location is always busy and a bit touristy, but it has more Pittsburgh ambiance than the other locations in town.  Nonetheless, you'll get a great sandwich, for a good price that is uniquely Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the staff wasn't overly friendly (well at least not to me).  I guess there were some regulars in there that my server paid more attention to, and was very curt when it came to interacting with me.  I've been to the original Primanti's in the Strip District as well as the ones in Monroeville, Moon, and Harmarville and they all have friendly staff.  However, I guess it's who you know at this location.  Like I said, the food was good, it was clean and the price was right and that's what mattered the most.  I'll just stick to the other locations in the area next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Native Pittsburgher so this applies to every Primanti Bros and it pains me- I love Primantis's brothers sandwich filler, bread, and coleslaw but the French fries are consistently undercooked which ruins the overall rating.  Seriously - how hard is it to deep fry a fry?  This has been a consistent negative review for you for decades, when will you correct?    You can only improve- cook your fries!!!"}
{"text":"Disgustingly fattening food without much taste.  Sure it's a Pittsburgh \"tradition,\" but someone would have to pay me to eat there again."}
{"text":"Ate here after catching a play. Service was good and the food was good overall. Enjoyed our sandwiches (ham and turkey) and the cheese fries are pretty good too. Defiantly a place we'll go back to for late night burgh dining."}
{"text":"O was expecting more according to the reviews. I ordered a Angus & cheese sandwich, the meat was very tough, almost a chewing gum. We also ordered a buffalo salad and it was not good at all.. not coming back!"}
{"text":"The sandwich is special, so go at least once for the experience. The past reviews said it all- fries + coleslaw + your choice of meat between two slices of white bread. Do it. 

We also got the chili cheese fries, which were pretty bomb.com. If I ever went again, I would probably just get the chili which had large chunks of tomato. So good. 

Cash only unless you want to end up doing their dishes."}
{"text":"As soon as I laid my eyes on this sandwich on Man V. Food, I knew I had to take that 9 hour drive from Queens to Pittsburgh...best decision EVER. I arrived close to midnight, so I don't remember my exact order except that it contained cole slaw, fries, and i think pastrami..what's not to love about this combo?  The cole slaw gave a nice crunch and off set the greasiness of the fries.  I could see this as a great post-drinking meal.

I ended up coming back the morning I was headed back to NY and tried the ham version of what I originally ordered.  Definitely didn't have the same kick as the pastrami.  Also ordered the chili cheese fries. I remember the fries being a bit on the pricier side and not quite as delicious as I had imagined."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and I had heard about this place on Diners, drive in's and dives. Guy said that this is a must visit place. It was a group of us and we sat outside. The service was prompt and friendly. I ordered a Angus steak and cheese sandwich and a draft Summer ale. The sandwich was huge (see pic). Every sandwich has coleslaw and french fries on it. The cole slaw is a vinegar based slaw. It is is a little different but it had a nice tang to the sandwich. Although the sandwich was huge there really is not a lot of meat. You can ask for additional meat for a small charge. Overall it was a good experience but not quite as mind blowing as Guy described."}
{"text":"The fries (in the sandwich) were cold and mushy, the tots were cold and I think they were made two three hours earlier and it tastes really bad,  even the hamburger was so mediocre, maybe this is their new branch and they are not good, I have not tried the original one but nothing was good,   everything we tried was warmed up in microwave"}
{"text":"On my weekend visit to Pittsburgh, I quickly learned that Primanti Bros. was a must try.  My first taste was at PNC Park where they have an express version, but I must have had 10 to 20 people tell me that I must also try the original location in the Strip District to get the full experience.  So...at about 2am after a night of bar hopping, I wandered down through the warehouses and found myself in a packed restaurant.  I'd tried the roast beef & cheese at the ballpark and decided to try something different at this location.  I was disappointed when told that there was no more tuna, so I settled on the ham, egg & cheese.  Loaded with slaw and onions, I scarfed this monster sandwich down with ease.  Like the one at the ballpark, I found it to be good, but not great.  For me, the slaw is a bit overpowering and the soft bread makes it a huge mess to eat.  I'd order one again someday, but probably go with the black angus steak & cheese.  According to my last taxi driver, he claims that it's the best."}
{"text":"Came here because of the history behind it (and a recommendation from my uber driver). The sandwich is honestly more for the experience than the taste. It has too much going on and the flavor a are not a good compliment. The lettuce (which I suspect is actually shaved cabbage) is overpowering, the burger patty was so so, and same with the fries. Not a fan of the French bread. I like the open concept kitchen and the ambiance is great. Service is not great, but not bad. Won't be coming back after this visit."}
{"text":"Excellent Sandwiches!  Pastrami HIGHLY recommended...if you are close by be sure to make time to stop!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 15 years, I've visited nearly every Primanti Brother's there are.  It's
 - Historical: Back when the steel business was booming, the workers needed an all-in-one one-handed meal they could eat at work.  Primanti's famous sandwich provided an answer with their super sandwiches.  Pittsburgh is now known for putting potatoes or fries on all kinds of stuff (salads, perogies, etc.).  If you've never been to Primanti's you should go, if nothing else for the historicity.

 - The Food:  The sandwich is smartly made.  The German-style slaw isn't too sour, the fries aren't too salty, and the bread is fresh.  This combination of cheap, fill-ingredients makes for a tasty affordable sandwich.

 - The Hype: Fame has diminished the Primanti's experience over the years.  Service doesn't have to be good, because people will continue to eat here regardless.  Prices have risen over the years, and still there are lines out the door every weekend.  The quality of sandwich itself hasn't changed over the time I've been here as far as I can tell."}
{"text":"Always good food and they don't care if you order your sandwich without the fries (as I always do, since I'm not a fan of their fries on or off the sandwich). The sandwiches are delicious. The fries are normally soggy and not good at all."}
{"text":"Always great sandwiches and they don't care if you special order them (no fries or fries on the side, etc.) at this location. Amazingly fresh bread and really good service."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh Staple is an understatement! This place is like a haven for Pitt natives and visitors alike! 

The uber laid back feel you  gett eating off of brown paper and foil just wears even the snobbiest person bown to a easy going person similar to the pittsburgh way! 

I would travel 45 minutes from Morgantown, WV to get one of these Primanti sandwiches! And even after relocating to NYC everytime I fly into Pitt airport I'm sure to make sure I make my Primanti stop and my choice is only the original the 18th Street location!"}
{"text":"You can't go to Pittsburgh and not get Primanti Bros.  For my fellow Detroiters it's like not going to Coney Island when friends are in town.    

Sandwiches are great - all of them come with coleslaw and frenchfries (ON the sandwich).  They have a full bar at this location.   It was in the high 80's with high humidity so a Blue Moon went perfect with our meals."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Primanti's, but this location is terrible. This location had below average service, boring atmosphere, and my sandwich being the worst Primanti's sandwich I've ever had. It came out cold, my steak was undercooked extremely to the point of it being like chewing gum. will definitely never go back to this location.. Sticking to the classics in the city of Pitt."}
{"text":"For the price, you get a lot of food. I got the fried pickles, which were decent. But the sandwiches were not good at all. They were lacking in flavor and the fries weren't hot when I bit into my sandwich. My boyfriend didn't like his either and ended up eating only a quarter of it before throwing it away.

 The place was a bit dirty, but the people working here were very nice. I would come back here to get their appetizers (my friend is obsessed with their cheese wedges), but not for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was told by everyone that when visiting Pittsburgh, Primanti Bros is a must-visit, and I agree.  This location is the original and so I made sure this was the one I visited.  I came on a Thursday for lunch and got a table right away.  There is a large variety of sandwiches you can order and they all come with fries and coleslaw on top.  The price is great for the size of the sandwich that you get.  I got the \"Joe, Dick, & Stanley\" and one of the meats (I believe it was the roast beef) was a strange texture.  Also, it was lacking sauce and was pretty dry considering how much filling is in the sandwich.  However, the staff was friendly.  I definitely recommend trying it at least once if you are a visitor to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! So delicious!! However, our server Meghan was literally miserable. Granted we did come in pretty close to the kitchen closing, but we had come from an event and knew what we wanted immediately. I don't think this girl smiled one time. Brought our check with our meals. Never checked in. Never asked if we needed anything. Stopped her for some silver ware and she literally rolled her eyes. Ok Meghan, God forbid you do your job. It hasn't been the first time we had her as a server and her attitude mimicked last experience as well. 
As a member of the service industry I understand a lot goes on a customer doesn't see, and a late table can be frustrating but at least pretend to care; even a little."}
{"text":"Seriously, is that lady ALWAYS working?  She was there the first time I was there, she was there when Stupid Man vs. too much or inedibly spicy Food was there, she was there the other day.  Her likeness is on the menu.  Hmm.

So anyway, I don't have anything original to say here.  I always have the pastrami with everything + an egg.  It's great.  It's cheap, and a Pittsburg institution.  Eat at this location, not the suburban ones.  The food is better and the ambience (or lack thereof) is better.

Bring cash.  No credit cards accepted.  (the suburban ones do take CC)"}
{"text":"I like the location - plenty of parking. Great Bar Setting with plenty of HDTV to watch the games. They have a good selection of beers on tap. Few of the times I've been - here - the bar scene was mostly older men. However, they do have 1/2 off happy hour :)

The food is great but will mostly depend on your taste bud. Of course, if you're a first timer - make sure to try the original famous sandwich. But if you're a picky eater - their pizzas are pretty good.

The price is reasonable and definitely worth the portion. Service has always been good the time I've been there."}
{"text":"A must-try because it's famous and unique.  I personally like the knockwurst and/or capicola with egg.  Put some ketchup on the bottom of your basket, mix with some tabasco, and dip the sandwich.  That's the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Years ago I saw Primanti Bros. on the food network while I lived in Ohio. I promised myself that when given the opportunity to try them I would.  I came on a lovely Friday afternoon so all the out door tables were taken. We came inside and sat at the bar. I ordered the bacon sandwich (bacon, fries, cole slaw and a fried egg) while my friend had the colossal fish sandwich. There was some SERIOUS bacon on my sammich! I was taken aback since so many places are stingy with bacon. My sandwich was over indulgent and amazing. I only ate half but took the rest home."}
{"text":"tried this place based on everyones recommendation of visiting pittsburgh.  Worth trying at least once in your life, if not for the food definitely for the people and the camaraderie.  It's cool just to experience this restaurant with all the steelers fans. Personally did not like the food, but experience was worth it all."}
{"text":"Should be 7 star's food is amazing, local people who do it right, all these years, still Killin it. Service is great, something to be said for a place that is legendary, you just can't go wrong, open 24/7 I will return again, to those reviewers who said this was just eh, go eat cardboard, your tastebuds are burnt out on fast food crap. Let's get real, fresh food, prepared as you wait, beats , hot light held garbage any day."}
{"text":"It was really good just not my personal preference of taste. The Italian bread and coleslaw were both really good. The fries were okay but a tad bit dry and the Cajun chicken was über spicy. The tuna was a little sour but the bacon was good. Overall the food was good but definitely not amazing."}
{"text":"Always gotta love primantis when you're a pgh local. Staff was kind and quick. Food was excellent. Always a good experience eating here!"}
{"text":"Primanti's is a local food.  For anyone like me who grew up in the Pittsburgh area, your brain is already hardwired for borderline obsession with this product.  However, if you're a first-timer, you might love it, you might hate it.  Or maybe it will take you a few tries and it will grow on you.  That seem to be the case for any regional fare.  If it were a food that everyone instantly loved, Primanti's would be a national chain.  But thank goodness it's not, because the nostalgia of this Pittsburgh, blue-collared staple would be lost anywhere outside the city.  (But who am I kidding, I'd probably visit the Florida locations, too, if I were in the area.)  

You may not love it, but you owe it to yourself to at least try it."}
{"text":"Primanti's is classic Pittsburgh:  A lot of heavy food really cheap.  If you need to take an out-of-towner out to eat, this is the place to go.  You should also go to this particular one, as it's the original.  It's super informal.

Here is the breakdown:  Your choice of lunch meat/meat and coleslaw and french fries on fresh bread.  You can add cheese and a lot of other things as well.  If you aren't a huge eater, split it with a friend.  These sandwiches feel like lead in my stomach, and I am happy with just a 1/2.

They do serve beer in many sizes so you can have a beer or two with your sandwich.  There are also wings and pizza, but I've never tried them or seen anyone order them.  The sandwiches are the big draw.

Low point:  There are always a bunch of rude, drunk Yinzers here.  They're loud, and they'll harass you.  I don't like going out to eat and being bothered by others, but some people seem to not mind.  This isn't \"people being friendly.\"  It's people being annoying so just be prepared.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"i don't normally like to eat this kind of food because it's completely unhealthy. but it's so good late at night after drinking."}
{"text":"Really good overall. Great for late night since it's always open and loved trying the Pittsburgh classic. No complaints about the sandwich, very good!"}
{"text":"Good food reasonable price.  This time had hamburger and fries.Ordered on-line saved time because of limit time for lunch, It was ready when I got there."}
{"text":"When I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Pittsburgh I spent the days eating and drinking my way through this delightful town.
 I spent my first day on \"The Strip\", and of coarse I had to stop into Primanti Bros! I sat at the little counter and enjoyed chili cheese fries, beer and conversation with the servers!
  Obviously I still dream about the chili cheese fries and can not wait to visit again! I wish I could remember the  name of the woman that I chatted with, she has been working there for years and was so sweet!"}
{"text":"I like to stop at this Primantis when I am back in Pittsburgh.  I used to live in the south side... And would frequent the Primantis/Blue Note, the strip district, and downtown.  I like this Primantis better because there is more room... I think it was a former bennigans so there is a bar and a separate dining room.  Lots of TVs and noise but there is room to spread out.  As for the sandwiches I always add a fried egg and raw onions and keep the slaw and fries on the sandwich too.  I like to keep it real."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are fantastic unfortunately the atmosphere isn't something to strive for, but that's not the point! It's a city classic hole in the wall. It's a standard every time I go to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My taste for this place isn't good. I know a ton of people who live for this place, but I just can't bring myself to like it. I only gave it 3 stars based on my husbands taste. He LOVES this place. Bleh. I don't understand the deal with coleslaw on sandwiches. Yuck."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich shop I have ever been to. Very friendly and fast service. The lady on the grill would produce 10 sandwiches and could still hold a conversation with you. Prices were fantastic. Only down side is it is cash only."}
{"text":"It is the original and they know what they are doing!  I go on the weekends at 11am, otherwise you will most likely be waiting in line!  But it is worth it!  
There are no menus, so take a look on the wall menu and try to have your order ready by the time you get to your seat.  The server will be over quick!  They will take a drink order immediately.  Come back within a few minutes and want to take your food order.  I will save you the time, don't try to order the fries on the side.  They come on the sandwich!!  Its delicious that way!  Get yourself a yuengling and you are ready for the Steelers game!
The original shop has all kinds of celebrity pics including Hilary Clinton.  Very cool!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the original Down the strip!  
We went for some sandwiches before the baseball game a few days ago and the place was packed.  (Which we expected!) They do not have a check in, so we just scouted out a table and waited for them to finish to get a seat.  Lots of beers on tap, no complaints there!  But the sandwiches all cam out very overdone!!  I got the egg and cheese and there was a huge, I mean HUGE, hunk of burnt cheese on the sandwich.  My friend got a meat filled sandwich and had to take off a lay bc it was so cooked.  The grill master must have been having an off night!?  I was a little disappointed since I had friends visiting from out of town and they had heard so much about the sandwiches!  Kind of a bummer!  
Will prob stick to the Strip location from now on."}
{"text":"Definitely did not live up to the hype.  Sure, I ate my sandwich.  It was fine.  I was full afterwards.  But it just wasn't that good -- the white bread, the bland-tasting meat, the uninspired coleslaw and fries.  I should have listened to the Pittsburgh natives I consulted prior to my visit who all told me to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great Bar, always have some games on the t.v,  if you have  curious taste buds you can certainly find something new here

always good food, always great service, i eat here every time i touch down in city..... high recommend, no sandwich like it! 


Big portions, worth that money.......


try the corn beef or pastrami"}
{"text":"The sausage and cheese sandwiches were pretty good. It could be much better if the service was better."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is.  Lame sandwiches.  Much better options on the strip."}
{"text":"Good food and even better service. A bit cramped and a bit hard to find out where to wait in line, but don't let that deter you from this great restaurant"}
{"text":"So after hearing about all the raves and reviews about Primanti Bros, I had to try it for myself. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit disappointed. I think it is more of a novelty thing than anything. I would say yes, you should try it if you happen to come to Pittsburgh, but try not to expect a lot because that might have killed the sandwich for me.

The sandwich is packed with great meat, but the fries were pretty soggy and coleslaw that day was a bit too much pepper for my liking. I thought the fries might have been soggy because of the coleslaw so I ordered another order of fries (since I'm generally a fries fiend), but even those were soft and not up to par. I was pretty disappointed at that. However, the meat was pretty delicious. I got corned beef and it was delicious slices and it was cooked well.

I would say overall verdict: try the place but try with an open mind."}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh, you MUST grab a sandwich from Primanti's. When it's almost midnight and you need that last meal of the day, they've got you covered. If you need a snack, I recommend sharing :-) 

Don't let their appearance fool you, the staff may not be in suits, but they're nice and they'll help you navigate the menu like a regular (even if you're not)!  Also, please don't go all \"When Harry met Sally\" on your sandwich. The fries come standard ON your sandwich, as does the tomato and slaw. 

The bottom line: Go because you're \"supposed\" to, but enjoy something new and don't pass judgement on the atmosphere, you'll feel like a \"regular\" if you let it happen!"}
{"text":"I don't particularly like this location of Primanti Bros. because it's really small and the menu is limited. With that said, Primanti's is a Pittsburgh classic! The food is cheap, fast, and good. Definitely a great place to watch any sports game or have a quick lunch. One of my favorite Primanti sandwiches is the one with lots of bacon!! It's soooooooo good. I also enjoy the BLT Tots and Terror Tots. I'm not sure if they have them at this location but I've had them at the North Versailles location."}
{"text":"They accommodated a group of 25 or so hockey players/parents for \"linner\". My son and I both had the classic cheese-steak/coleslaw/fries sandwich for which they are known. It was very good (and filling). I wasn't a big fan of the plan, white bread used for my sandwich, but I guess that's part of the package. Overall, still very good."}
{"text":"Gave into the hype of the place and decided to check it out during my trip to Pittsburgh. It was extremely underwhelming. The place was clustered. Our waiter got our orders mixed up, and the sandwiches were lukewarm and unimpressive. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"SUPER BUSY- SUPER LOUD- SUPER PITTSBURGH- Great place to start our food journey in the Burgh. Everyone said its a must and they were RIGHT - we had a great time - great food - Everyone happy even bought the T-Shirts - a must when in the Burgh!  One of our sandwiches was made wrong waitress just gave us the sandwich and hurried back for the correct order - no excuses just completely \"how can I make you happy?\" Staff was BUSY, no time for small talk but So nice and we felt taken care of - so much food bring your appetite!  Must add the Cole slaw was bomb and a great addition! We are not slaw fans but it really added to the sandwich ! Loved the fries!"}
{"text":"We decided to meet friends here to start off a night out.  I really wish we had gone somewhere else. 

It was busy and there was a wait, which was about 20 minutes..... No biggie since it's Saturday night & there was a Pens game on. They sat all 4 of us in a small Booth next to the bar. It was pretty cramped, as my husband & his friend are both husky fellas. 

It took forever for our waiter to come over to say hi and get our drinks..... And such a long time to get our beers! We finally ordered. It took a little bit to get our food... A flat bread and wings. The food runner brought over our food. We finally saw our server and flagged him down to ask for a side of ranch.(which we never do because it's rude, but he had been nowhere in sight for some time.... not even at his other tables). He brought the ranch quickly and asked if we needed anything else. That was the last time we even saw him until it was time for the bill, at which time he asked if we needed anything else and dropped the checks when we said no. 

I used to work at a different Primantis and I really feel like the quality of the food has gone down hill & the prices are ridiculous. My hubby got a bucket of 24 wings and they were incredibly tiny and over cooked. We couldn't tell the server that though because he never stopped by our table to ask how everything was! There wasn't a manager in sight at all. 

Plus side..... We were in good company.... And the ladies room had framed pictures of good looking actors and models lining the walls, which was pretty funny & great at the same time..... Plus the restroom was clean. 

Don't know if I will be back any time soon (I can go elsewhere for better food for the same, if not lower, price)."}
{"text":"I have first visited to Primanti Bros. in 2009 and don't remember what the sandwiches tasted like.  We went back again in July of this year  on this trip to Pittsburgh and Cleveland and decided to visit it again since we have no recollection of what the hype on the sandwiches from the first visit.  The restaurant was not busy but it took a very long time to get a server and the server was not really  friendly toward us.  He took our orders and came back later with the bill when he saw that we were finished.   I ordered the New Yorker. My husband ordered the Pitts-burger. My son ordered the Joe,Dick and Stanley.   My sandwich was soggy with cold fries with not much meat. I tried a little of the Pitts-burger and the hamburger was bland.  My husband thought the Pitts-burger didn't have much taste either so it needed the hot sauce. This might explain why there was a bottle of hot sauce on the table to use. My son said his sandwich was very good but he is a child who always have positive things to say about everything. The sandwich was not memorable the first time and not memorable in a positive way for  taste or service this time. The bathroom was downstairs so you had to walk down the steps to a basement with concrete walls which felt kind of creepy if you are  alone. This is definitely a unique  touristy stop  but it really is over hyped. At least there was free parking!"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of a couple friends. They weren't lying, the food is amazing! To start, I grabbed a seat at the bar. My server was really nice. I asked for a Miller Lite, as she gave me a sample of a local brew called IC Light, and told me it was the special of the day. I liked it so I went with that. For my appetizer, I got boneless honey BBQ wings. They were amazing! Then it came time for my sandwich. I got the Capone. It was capicola, pastrami, Italian sausage, provolone cheese, Cole slaw, and fries. Normally comes with tomato also but I got it without that. Delicious!! The people who recommended this place didn't steer me wrong! The manager came and struck up a conversation with me about baseball since I was in town for the game. He shook my hand, said thanks for coming in, and made me feel welcome with open arms. I'd recommend this place for great food and great people. Definitely a place I would come back to if I'm in town again! And I hope I can come to this location! Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Looking for a local staple that also serves up hearty and delicious sandwiches with fries IN the sandwich? Then Primanti's is for you! I went here on a recommendation from my friend who is a local to Pittsburgh while I was in town on business. My group all opted for sandwiches which come with coleslaw and fries piled high on the sandwich itself. I heard rave reviews about the pastrami, but I opted for the bacon and provalone sandwich. Yes, it's a heavy meal, but so so good! The service was speedy and the whole vibe was definitely Pittsburgh proud. You only have to look anywhere in the place to be reminded that this is Steelers country and you should wear your gold and black loud and proud. It's always fun to visit a local landmark and this place will fill that need."}
{"text":"We talked to some locals who love this place. The food was good but the service was great! We came in after 9:00 and got a great deal off their $5 after 9 menu. The manager stopped by to ask us about our experience and our waitress, Tiffany was super attentive. The best part of our meal was definitely the bread pudding dessert! We shared an appetizer, huge sandwich, and dessert for under $20. It's a bar atmosphere with fun music and plenty of parking at this location."}
{"text":"Anyone on a diet should not eat at Primanti Bros. because it is simply a waste of time not to get their sandwiches. Their sandwiches are pretty much junk food glory as each one is topped with a pile of fries, coleslaw and tomatoes. 
Exhibit A: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TKDL0wiztnEr_rMkX8ZomQ?select=pvhrvuyT9zS0kOcS33X9lw
and Exhibit B: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TKDL0wiztnEr_rMkX8ZomQ?select=BxiqChmE8yGpRwMKcOnXgQ  

**Edit: A yelper brought up the subject of the meat - here it is - falling out of the back of the sandwich: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TKDL0wiztnEr_rMkX8ZomQ?select=bKY2O8RwCfJaCIRZU_ZXAA

I felt like quite a fatty after consuming my corned beef + cheese + fries + coleslaw + tomatoes but it was so good! I couldn't stop bite after bite even though I was full after eating the first half. The bread doesn't hold up too well toward the end but who cares? It's the insides that count, not the bread! The bread is just the vessel to get to your mouth so if it comes to it, just use your hands!

In the back room, the set up is to order at the counter and then pay later after you've eaten. They'll bring it to your table once you've found a seat and collect payment. If you wanted booze (as my friend did), he went to the front bar, ordered his beer and then came back with it. Otherwise, for sodas or water or whatever, you could order it at the regular counter and they'll give it to you. It seemed a bit disorganized but somehow it all worked. Others have complained about the service but really what do you expect? This is not exactly fine dining. You get your food, they get their money and everyone is happy...and fatter. 

Primanti Bros. is the must-do for any out-of-towner or guest and you should not make fun of them if they happen to misprounce \"Primanti\". This may or may not have happened to me but I cannot confirm or deny this. And for the newbies, Primanti sounds like [Pri-manty] and not [Pri-monty]. Just saying."}
{"text":"Never miss a chance for a classic Primanti Bros sandwich when passing through Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Pittsburgh,  this is a MUST! I've been to a couple of other locations: downtown, strip district and mt. lebanon. For this visit, we went to the one in mt. Lebanon. My cousin came from Toronto and I wanted him to experience Pittsburgh! Lucky for us, the pigs fly sandwich was back for a limited time. We ordered one of those and a Pittsburgher (#2 best seller). If you're wondering what #1 is, I was told that it was the beer. The food came out pretty quick.  We really liked them, I preferred the pigs fly over the Pittsburgher due to the egg and bacon. All their sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw on top. One thing that I wasn't a fan of was the coleslaw.  Although I love coleslaw, their coleslaw is a bit sour and I prefer them a bit sweet. Their sandwiches usually run around $7 which is pretty affordable. Overall,  we had a good lunch as our waiter was friendly and the atmosphere made us feel as if we were in a cabin."}
{"text":"Another score!

 Yet another as-seen-on-tv spot that thankfully lived up to the hype. 
I went to the original location on 18th Street, and I loved the warm 
tiny-hole-in-the-wall-that-serves-kickass-food feeling. 
My sandwich was overflowing, and very happily too if I may say so.
I haven't been to the newer locations, but I wonder if the atmosphere
is really what tied it all together for me. Regardless, one of the best
sandwiches I've ever had that I can still remember what it tasted like...

if I close my eyes... 

and dream."}
{"text":"One star is way too many here...  Such an awful experience.  If I could give it a negative five stars I would.  

1) bartender who thought she was straight out of the Jersey shore and too good to wait on people SUCKED beyond belief.  Nothing but attitude the whole time we were there.  Part of my meal never came out and she never checked on things and when I tried to flag her down was ignored. Poor service.  I was still charged for this item and since she would not wait on his, when I paid, I even made note of this... I saw her read it... and still no apology for sucking.  

2) with so many TV's, we found it ridiculous that they would not put on the Ravens/Bengals game.  I am a Steeler fan, but their season is over, and since the Ravens and Bengals are going to the playoffs it would have been nice to be able to watch this.  We even asked the manager... we got a NO, that the Steeler game would be on everything minus the one TV that would have Red Zone on.  Why have NFL Sunday Ticket I am asking then?  You have people coming to your establishment to spend money to watch a game, and you pretty much tell them to F off and follow it up with changing the TV's for some other people?  Klassy, Primanti's.  

We went here because it was where friends wanted to meet us... we will NEVER be back.  This was the final straw for me.  No matter what, even if I am craving one of these sandwiches, I cannot continue to patronize a place that has such poor customer service, rude employees and is not even that good (with the exception of the occasional sandwich)."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game for the most part, but I do have some tidbits that I can offer management....

Your bartender this past Sunday- she was awesome, on top of things, friendly, attentive and just plain good... she was super busy and did not miss a beat IMO.  I would give her 5 stars if I could.  

Your food runner this past Sunday- get someone who is not nasty and pi$$ed that they are a food runner.  She practically threw our food down at us and when a friend came and joined us, she did the same thing.  I do not care how miserable you are, try to be nice to your patrons when you are working... or get a new job if it makes you that miserable!  Even the bartender acknowledged her attitude and apologized.  

Food was yummy, better than many other locations as I usually frequent the city locations and not the suburbs so the atmosphere is a tad different."}
{"text":"I just moved here back in September and one of the first places i was told to go for great food was Primanti Bros. The food was great as I was told from several people from the area and back home.

What I was not happy with was the setting policy and service. Just to get a seat here I had to wait standing up watching people eat like a creepy stalker just to see who would get up first and finally when I got a seat no one cleaned our table for a while or even took our order cause no one even knew we had been seated. If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card. It took so long and with other people looking at us to get the hell up so they could sit we just walked in to retrieve the card at was just sitting on the back of the bar and had not yet been processed so I had to wait again.

Food can only get you so far, so my suggestion is if you want a good Food and can wait an hour feel free and come here. If you don't have the time just go next door to the Subway."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the Pitts-Burger sandwich and it was just the right amount of food. It was served on 2 thick slices of soft white bread and topped with fries and a crunchy, tangy coleslaw. All-in-all everything tasted good. They also serve alcohol and have TV screens on the patio so you can watch the game."}
{"text":"This wasnt my first trip to Primanti brothers but for some reason I remember it being more special and delicious than it was. I tried the Pitts-burger and it was good but not ,\" i think ill come back tomorrow good.\" The portion is huge. I would suggest splitting it if you can! We ordered fries which was a mistake because we were so full from the sandwhich. The fries we did eat tasted burnt and werent all I wanted and more. Service wasnt friendly and people seemed annoyed we were there. I think next time I am in Pittsburgh I will try something new. The burger was just a burger you could get out of the freezer and lacked a lot of seasoning. The fries were average and under seasoned. I think they just needed to add some salt and pizazz and a smile on their face. Give it a try. I mean it was featured on diners drive in and dives so it was worth the experience to say you had been there."}
{"text":"I suggest the hot sausage!! One place that you should get a bite to eat if your in Pittsburgh! I suggest a Steeler football victory and a sandwich at Primanti Brothers!! All on a Sunday or Monday night!! That would be after a Steeler game! But! lucky for you, Primati's is open 24hours a day!! 7 days a week!!!"}
{"text":"Owney's bottomline: DON'T DO IT!!!! It's TERRIBLE FOOD!!! People will try to convince you that you \"just have to do it while in Pittsburgh\"....BUT DONT!!! Waste of money, time and calories. 

Far overrated. I dont understand why this place get's so much attention. The take away is that these are BLAND, messy and boring creations. 

I tried the cheese steak, which was recommended to us as their best seller. The meat was tired and dull, the coleslaw was sub par (ive had better at the grocery store), and the french fries were boring and soggy. If this place is going to be famous for stuffing french fries in to their sandwiches then it should make sure those fries are phenomenal. These are not - not even close. 

I also tried the chili cheese fries. I literally had about 5 bites and couldnt take it anymore. A soggy, sloppy and disgusting mess. Dont get me wrong, I love sloppy food when it's done well, but this was just a disaster. Maybe adding bacon bits adds character to food, but it doesnt add taste and it was a bad idea on this concoction. 

Seriously - they make their money by out of towners like me who hear how great it is on TV and who convince themselves its going to be great and tell others. It's a vicious cycle that breathes life in to bad food. DONT DO IT! PS - nice people though.

Oh yeah....by the way...if you are going to be a \"Pittsburgh Institution\" and franchise your crappy food then you can at least get a card swipper for your IPhone and accept credit cards. 

It's this kind of mind boggling stupidity that makes me wonder why this HORRIBLE place is still in business."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting extended family and this place came highly recommended. We would not be back. 

My son had the kids macaroni and cheese. Overcooked noodles with some sort of cheddar cheese sauce. 

I ordered the turkey and cheese. The turkey itself was good. Everything else was dumped off my sandwich. It was just so bland and dry. 

My husband ordered a sandwich and said the same. The meat was good but it was dry overall. 

Our waitress was pleasant enough but we had to go to her for our bill."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak sandwiches + cole slaw + fries... mmm.
Best sandwich place in Pittsburgh. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love fries. Love slaw.  Love cajun chicken. But together in 1 bite? Amazing! We went to the original Primanti's in the Strip District, so the wait was a bit long (about 30 minutes on a Saturday afternoon) but well worth it!

Highly recommended to anyone dropping by da Burgh and looking to try what the city does best :)"}
{"text":"I always try to hit this location when I'm in town. Great staff menu is solid & a Pittsburgh tradition."}
{"text":"Primanti's always provides a great experience.  Whether you go to watch a game with a group or just a dinner, you are sure to have good service and great food.  They offer some great specials as well.

The sandwiches are obviously what they are known for.  The cheesesteak, which is not really a cheesesteak, is my favorite.  The bread is so fresh, fries are fresh cut, and I love the oil based coleslaw.  It all just comes together to make the perfect sandwich.

For those who aren't into the primanti's sandwiches they have plenty of other good food for you.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich is another favorite of mine here.  The pizza is surprisingly very good as well.  You can't go wrong with just about anything on their menu."}
{"text":"When will the food hype finally understand that BIG does not necessarily equate to GOOD? Primanti Bros was featured on TV for its enormous sandwiches, which in addition to a generous helping of meat also feature fries stuffed in between two slices of bread. That's what made them famous, that's what got them on national TV.

The quality is above average, and as expected, the fries just add more bland carbohydrate-ish taste and additional calories to an already unnecessarily calorific sandwich. The meat itself is good quality, but also nothing to write home about.

The short: overrated, nothing special, there are better sandwich shops to be had for the price."}
{"text":"Thick, homemade Italian bread. Light, vinegar-y slaw. Whatever meat you choose. I vote pastrami. Tomatoes. Hand-cut fries. 

I feel like people can't really understand the word sandwich without trying this one. I do recognize that not everyone can appreciate a good sandwich (particularly one that is mostly cold) but it's SOOO good!! Please walk around the Strip District. Maybe take in a museum or 2. Work up a good appetite.  And the eat this!!! All of it."}
{"text":"Definitely a must if you have never been here. They only have bottle beer and Coca Cola products, they call it Pop. IC light beer tastes like water literally.  The Pitts-burger is decent but cooked well done, juicy not over cooked.  The Colossal fish was delicious and of course all portions are generous.  Server was knowledgeable about places to go locally afterwards and friendly."}
{"text":"DUDE. These guys are not messing around. 

I was in Pittsburgh for literally 16 hours, but my friend from the area said we had to go to Primanti's, and she didn't lead us astray. It wasn't busy on a Monday night at 7, mainly because the city totally shuts down after 5 so we got great service from the gal at the bar. 

Despite the fact that we knew what we were getting into, everyone besides my hubby and I decided not to share. Bad move, buddy. These sandwiches are ridiculous. Our capicola & cheese came loaded with fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes. It was sort of an adventure figuring out how to eat that bad boy, but super good! I tried a piece of the hot sausage and it was just as tasty as ours.

If you're only in town for a short while (which I hope for your sake you are) Primanti Bros. is a must taste while in town!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food was good. Large portions for the meals. However the wings were tiny. And rather bland. Service was good though. A little disappointing considering the awesome experience I last had here."}
{"text":"Waited a month to get here with work to eat. Been to the original many times and it always was great.  Food was fine, but, rudest, nastiest, disrespectful people behind the counter at Market Square. Asked a few questions about different items and they we put out they had to answer. Asked for item to be added to my sandwich and cook was too busy flapping his yap with an off duty employee to listen and put the wrong thing on, then gave me attitude when i said that wasn't what I asked for....Last visit ever to Primanti's"}
{"text":"I tried them once because they were a huge deal in Pittsburgh. The sandwiches are too plain for my taste but the wings and pizza were ok. I haven't been back."}
{"text":"I am not a hater on Primanti Bro's.  I love me a Capicola & Cheese (double meat, and egg) any day of the week, but I was not impressed by this location at all because of the service. You can get a Primanti Sandwich from every corner of this city.  I would believe that if you are going to go to the one on Forbes, where they only serve their famous sandwiches, it would be a unique experience.  Actually it turned out to be a LONG experience, a lot longer than expected.  I got there around 1:30 in the afternoon, so I would assume after the lunch rush or towards the end at least.  In any case, the place was not packed, busy, but not overwhelming busy.   We were quickly seated, but it took about 20 minutes before a waitress even took our orders, and that was the easy part.  

Over the next 30 minutes we waited for three Primanti sandwiches, nothing special, just with egg on all three and a couple double meat.  Finally the sandwiches arrived, no double meat.  At this point, I really didn't care because I was so hungry, so I just enjoyed the feast that was before me.  The only reason why I am not rating this place lower, after the experience, is because the waitress was nice enough to apologize and not charge out us for the double meat (which we never got) and the sandwich  was as usual, l'awesome."}
{"text":"Not bad... I was in town for my son's football combine & decided to try it. It's been several years since eating here... Service was good... I ordered the Black Angus Steak Sandwich & it was huge... The french fries they put on the sandwich reminds me of Kennywood Fries (yummy)... I found out that they have $.48 wings all day on Sunday & ordered a few buffalo wings with ranch dipping sauce... The wings were a 10 on a scale of 1-10... The restroom was clean... I would have given them a 5 star, but the garbage cans outside the front door were overflowing from the day before..."}
{"text":"Woulda been a 1 star review if not for our cute & courteous waitress.

That said: YUCK!   This was my second supremely dissapointing Primanti's experience in nearly a decade of living in this fine little city.  I guess the fascination with this place must be that it it 1. has a bar 2. you don't have to order a side of fries or coleslaw because it's all gonna be slathered on your sandwich.  Bleh!  On my first Primanti experience, I ordered a corned beef sandwich as it shoud be, no fries or coleslaw on it.  So I was served 2 slices of bread and about 1.5 slices of corned beef.  What a rip off.  2nd experience, today, equally as awful.  But as i said... waitstaff was great.  I ordered a \"Pitts-burger\" with coleslaw and fries on the side.  Seriously, the quality of the burger I was served made 7-11 mini mart burgers seem gourmet.  I guess you really see what their overpriced, crappy sandwiches are truly made of when you strip off the fries & coleslaw.  Their fries are also soggy and gross.  Not a whole lot goin' on here except for cutie/attentive waitresses.  

If you want a decent, GIANT-sized sandwich and a real PGH experience, go to Peppi's."}
{"text":"I finely got to try this place after several visits to Pittsburgh. My sister and her bf said I had to try the Pitts-burger and they were right. That sandwich is so good! And I recommend it to everyone. There were 5 of us at the table laughing and talking, when the food came and everyone started digging in, there was complete silence. You know the food is good when everybody gets quiet! I tried my brother's wings and it made me consider getting an order to go for later. If a restaurant doesn't understand when you say you want your wings \"fried hard\" then run away...to the nearest Primantis because they do and pack in the flavor too."}

Everything was pretty good but wish i would of tried more as the sandwich i had was just a little better then average. Would like to give them more credit if i could"}
{"text":"First time in PA and Ive heard so many good reviews, so I tried it out. I ordered the steak sandwich, to my surprise I didnt know coleslaw and fries came on the sandwich. It added a different and unique touch to the sandwich. I will def visit again soon."}
{"text":"Love the garlic parm wings and this location did not disappoint once again the food was excellent the service was good  EXCEPT...
if you have leftovers...
We had a table of 6 with an $80 bill needing a box for pizza, fries, and 1/2 of a sandwich...our server brought the box for the pizza and 2 pieces of paper for me to wrap a wet sandwich in. I asked what the paper was she said \"that's for your take home sandwich\" \"ask my manager, that's what you get now\"...
Disappointing if that's the case, they do have boxes available if you push back.
I go out to eat to keep things simple, last thing I want to do is origami my food container."}
{"text":"\"Yinz goin to Primanny's fer a sammy after the Stiller game n nat?\"

This appears to be a Pittsburgh classic.  Coleslaw and fries up in your sandwich?  Ok.... that makes it easy to consume and turns out to be pretty effin' good.  Bomb ass sandwiches and relatively cheap beers.  Deals on Tuesday and Thursdays."}
{"text":"When I moved to Pittsburgh, I was told that I had to try this place because they had the best sandwiches and it was a great \"Pittsburgh experience.\" I could not have been more disappointed! I'm assuming the \"experience\" is waiting in a long line full of yinzer sports fanatics before/during/after a game. Luckily, when we went it was quite empty because I would have been extremely pissed if I waited more than 10 minutes for this awful sandwich. 

I'm not saying it's awful because it's greasy and unhealthy, I LOVE greasy and unhealthy. This was just bland and overrated. It really blows my mind that this is the sandwich shop that has grown to represent Pittsburgh! I ordered the Pittsburgher Cheese steak (the #2 bestseller according to the menu). Coming from Philadelphia, I have high standards for cheese steaks. I thought, \"Hmmm...a cheese steak with fries, coleslaw and an egg...what could go wrong?\"

EVERYTHING. 

The sandwiches are served on the softest bread that immediately soaks everything up and squishes paper-thin. I guess that's necessary because it's the only way you attempt to fit the giant disappointment in your mouth. The egg was flattened and dried out. The worst part of it was the meat. I became a little skeptical when i saw the cook carry out a box of frozen meat patties which made me reminiscent of time working at McDonald's in high school. The \"cheese steak\" consists of a beef patty that wouldn't even make a satisfactory burger. It was completely flavorless.

The best parts of the sandwich were the coleslaw and fresh cut fries, which I would have preferred to have on their own. I've hears the pastrami and cheese is pretty good, so if I'm ever pressured to try it again, I'd go with that. Otherwise, I'll get an overpriced sandwich somewhere else that won't be such a disappointment."}
{"text":"the Primanti Bros sammich was everything I expected it to be...and I inhaled it!  That's all I'll say."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Sandwich didn't wow me, yet that's what they're known for."}
{"text":"What can you say?  Pittsburgh's unique, signature sandwich, the envy of all my out-of-town friends who have seen this on cooking shows but have never visited the 'Burgh.  I prefer the hole-in-the-wall locations (the Strip, Oakland, Market Square) over the sit-down restaurants in the suburbs, but service is generally good at all of them.  My experience with the Oakland and Strip locations goes back 30 years now.  Very blessed (and I don't use that word) to have these here."}
{"text":"We were sat at a dirty table there was bloody napkins under the table. Our food was bland and cold and to top it off my husband went to use the restroom when we ARRIVED and it was covered in vomit. Still wasn't cleaned 30 minutes later and we told our waitress."}
{"text":"Since I am not from Pittsburgh, I may be missing the nostalgic taste of these sandwiches.  I don't understand how Primanti Bros is the crowned jewel of Pittsburgh eats.  If you go to Boston, eat lobster roll.  If you go to Texas, eat Texas BBQ.  If you go to Pittsburgh, eat at Primanti Bros ------ nope.  The sandwich looks big because they stuff it with fries.  The meat portion is so slim that when I opt out of fries, my sandwich looks sad.  The bread is not particularly different or unique.  The meat is what I'd expect at a NY corner deli.  Try it if you're curious and it's on your list because it's Pittsburgh.. otherwise, pass."}
{"text":"1. DON'T get the cheese-steak (\"2nd most popular item on the menu\") and DO get the corned beef sandwich. Much much better, not that it's going to be good.

2. DON'T expect anything fancy or amazing.  If you've ever been to canters or langers in LA, primanti's corned beef is just a shoddy knock-off version. Less meat, less flavor, soggy/dead fries.  And that coleslaw is pathetic.

Oh well, when in Pittsburgh..."}
{"text":"Not worth even a one-time visit.

\"Hey, it's my first time in Pittsburgh, and all the travel websites say to check out Primanti Bros!\"  That's what I said to myself, at least. Spoiler alert: it sucks. For one, the service was terrible. My server just straight up forgot my order, and instead of asking me again, just ignored me for 20 minutes. And I was sitting right at the grill, so he walked by me about 30 times. I figured things were backed up since it was busy, but I finally spoke up after I overheard him and the cook whispering about how he didn't know what I ordered.

The food sucks. Their \"signature sandwich\" is plain white bread, a tiny serving of unseasoned \"sirloin,\" a single slice of flavorless \"provolone\", a big stack of unseasoned French fries on the sandwich, and the blandest \"cole slaw\" I have ever had, then another slice of plain white bread. 

You will leave smelling like cooking oil. And their beer selection sucks. They had one local beer, and it's Iron City, which you can get anywhere. This place is surrounded by other restaurants, and I wish I had gone to literally any single one of them."}
{"text":"Good.  Not great.  Service is quick as expected.  Too much coleslaw for my liking. Sandwich is good but pastrami was chewy.  Fries were a little undercooked. Asked for double meat but same amount as friend.  Don't go out of your way"}
{"text":"We ate at Primanti's before watching a Steelers-Ravens matchup on a snowy December 24th a few years ago. It was five guys with lots of room to consume, and we needed the calories to keep us warm for the game. A cold and persistently penetrating wind whipped through the exposed stadium and made us get up from the garishly-colored, bright yellow seats to stamp our feet, clap our muffled hands, and generally cheer on \"our\" team to victory. But for whom to root? That was indeed the question. While I was wearing a Polamalu jersey - and grew up outside Pittsburgh in the northern panhandle of WVa - I was living at the time in Baltimore and had come to appreciate the defensive power and toughness of the Ravens squad (but not their arrogant, chinless former coach, or his idiotic sunglasses. Gloat after you've got more than one ring, buddy! Some Steelers have more rings than they do fingers, at least for one hand to bear). Still, I was totally on the fence about which side to cheer for, and that made me the enemy.

But we ALL could agree on Primanti's. I had the smoked turkey sandwich, the fries and slaw inside of course, and a local microbeer, the kind that once made this German-immigrant rich city famous before the world wars and the god awful mistake that was prohibition ended all that. Primati's was basically awash in black and yellow, terrible towels hanging from many a pocket. I thought about quoting Poe but wisely kept silent. It was a decision that likely saved my life in this football-frenzied city of the three rivers, in one of which my body likely would have been found floating the next morning, with purple blood floating on the dark waters (not the Monongahela, please! I can never spell that one right). Besides, my mouth was full with delicious food and brew. The Steel City never tasted so good. For even though the Steelers were vanquished on the gridiron that day by the Birdmen of Baltimore, Primanti's definitely came out a winner. But those fries and overstuffed sandwiches will get 'ya, even if Heinz, err, Hines Ward doesn't. Quoth my stomach, nevermore! Well, at least not more than once every visit to the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"Yep, I volunteered for a Pittsburgh work assignment strictly because of this restaurant.   Being a woman by myself in a town I'm not familiar with, this place was quite a challenge to find.   But I had to go to the original or why bother?

I had seen Primanti Bros featured on TV and it seemed like a really intimidating place to order and eat.   However, when I walked in there it was very casual and inviting.

I sat at the counter and ordered a roast beef and cheese with a Yuengling, and I watched as the cooks created my monster of a sandwich.  

I'm not a big fan of \"stuff\" in my sandwich but I was hooked by the first bite.   The roast beef was extremely juicy and soft, the coleslaw had the perfect tang, and the french fries were simply a fried bonus of goodness.

I would probably be about 500lbs if I lived in Pittsburgh because I would be eating there all of the time.  So good!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are interesting and the fries in them are interesting.

I don't like fries or potatoey fries, mostly just the crispy ones.

The sandwich was good and quick but because I'm not a huge fan of fries it wouldn't make sense for me to go back.

It also was super crowded."}
{"text":"When I think of Pittsburgh I think of two amazing things. Andy Warhol and Primanti Brothers. Even a vegetarian eating here can feel his arteries clogging from these ridiculously tasty concoctions. Cole slaw and fries on a sandwich! Amazing! I don't believe you will have lived until you have had one of these sandwiches."}
{"text":"So so good. My wife had the pastrami and I had the baloney. We both think it's really the bread that makes the sandwich . Got very lucky today in a Steelers weekend with no wait.  Service was great.  Go here it's worth it and the pricing is so fair."}
{"text":"Listen.  Primanti's isn't a place you go with your family, have a nice dinner, and talk about.  It's not \"the place you go when you come to Pittsburgh.\"  It's not a tradition.

So stop it.

Seriously...stop.

You know when Primanti's hits stride?  At one in the morning, when you're belligerently drunk, everything is closed, and you want something that is ok, and will put down a nice base to prevent tomorrow's hangover.

It's heavy, greasy, and full of starch, everything you want if you're trying to cope with the fact that you shouldn't have had that last shot of Jameson.

But to tell people that they need to come to this place, during regular business hours, and get a sandwich?  Shame on you Pittsburgh, how do you sleep at night?"}
{"text":"Best Bologna and cheese sandwich Ive ever had in my life! I was a bit concerned that they put coleslaw on all the sandwiches. I can not stand a soggy sandwich. So I was pleasantly surprised when the bread on my sandwich was was perfect not soggy at all. There was a long line outside when I visited on a Saturday around 2pm but we waited no longer than 5 mins to be seated. This place is busy so you will not get much attention from staff. The menu is not detailed and it is posted on the walls. It makes it difficult for first timers to make an informed decision. Do believe the hype. The sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are all right, kind of expected more and not quite worth the detour off of the highway. Semi-long wait, and just all right service. Original idea. Probably will come again if ever in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"made it a special point to stop by this joint on a recent trip to pittsburgh with a great expectation - however, did not seem to live up to all the hype.
ordered a cheese fries - my oh my - either fans of this establishment enjoy really salty fries or the server's wrist was hyperactive in sprinkling the salt shaker.
the pitt burger (#2 best seller) - although good size, the patty seemed much smaller than the bread and a bit overcooked too.  Concept is pretty nice though - fries/lettuce/coleslaw.  the waiter was in a hurry to take the order, but I wondered if there was an option to toast the bread.
the salty fries drove down the star ratings for me here.  hopefully others have had better experience."}
{"text":"Despite all the locals claiming this place is over rated, I felt that this was a place we still needed to check out for ourselves.  The staff was super nice & I even got a chance to say hi to the nice lady who is on all the food shows when they visit Pittsburgh.  Primanti Brothers is a cool place to park the car, grab a bite and take a walk to all the different stands on the surrounding streets.

 As far as the food goes I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't impressed either.  The sandwiches were just, OK.  The bread was freshly baked, the cold cuts were good but I guess what didn't do it for me was the cold soggy bland under cooked fries they crammed in the sandwich.  Now if your gonna have a sandwich as simple as that without so much as some mayo or some kind of dressing everything needs to be money.  

Any time I'm in an area where I can grab a cold Yuengling beer & some homemade chilli cheese fries (ironically enough our fries for the appetizer were cooked to perfection) I'm a happy camper.  I'm glad that I got a chance to cross Primanti Brothers off the list and would suggest a visit if you have never been and your in the area."}
{"text":"The sandwiches seem like a neat idea because they're stuffed with Fries and coleslaw.  But that's about all you taste when you eat their sandwiches.  In reality there's very little meat, lots of bread, lots of fries, and as a result their sandwiches are very dry and flavorless. Add lots of ketchup to help the chewing process."}
{"text":"How can I say this without betraying my commitment to my local deli... Well-- let's say this: if Primanti Brothers existed anywhere near San Francisco, I'd live next door. These sandwiches are sloppy, robust and full of goodness that is just essential to the signature Pittsburgh experience. 
I love this location because it's the original, and I have good memories drinking and devouring kielbasa like a Yinzer at their counter over the years when I'm in town. 
May Primanti Brothers reign supreme in sandwich world domination. Amen."}
{"text":"I am going to echo Colleen C here: \"A solid 4-stars for a solid-as-hell sandwich!\"

We sat outside on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. It was busy but we were able to be seated immediately. The waitress was running around like crazy but she took pretty good care of us. She did get my order wrong but I was willing to keep the wrong sandwich but she came back within 5 minutes with my correct one and apologized. That is great customer service. I am glad she did get me the correct one because I really wanted the ham and provolone.

So, the thing here that stands out to me (loving the north bread and missing it since I live in Orlando) is the BREAD! So freaking fresh and moist. So fluffy. You make fingerprints in it when you hold it, I love that. 

So my concern, the coleslaw... I hate mayo but here they make it with vinegar, win! 

Amazing bread, coleslaw, fries and tomatoes with whatever meats you want, delicious.

This is a must stop in Pitt just as everyone knows and tells you so do yourself a favor and listen to them!"}
{"text":"We split the pastrami sandwich which is supposedly the best seller. Very underwhelming. I heard this was a must try, whelp, I tried it. There was only a little bit of tasteless pastrami, lots of French fries, tomato slices, and some soggy cabbage (coleslaw), all on sliced French bread. It definitely lacked flavor and well, everything that could make it better."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very unique, at least for me. Everything was fresh and the slaw in the sandwich was much better than plain old lettuce. I had the pastrami and outside of the fact that it was just boars head, it came together very well. The kids enjoyed it as was. Cheddar fries were the highlight though. Yum."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!!! Fries, slaw, all on bread with meat doused with ketchup, malt vinegar and hot sauce...you CAN'T go wrong...PERIOD!!! LOVED IT! It was crowded as it was a Saturday and there was a Steelers game. The front was crowded and we went to the back part of the restaurant. The sandwiches are HUGE! We split one and were plenty FULL!!! If in Pittsburgh, you have to indulge in the local cuisine!"}
{"text":"The space is kind of tight and the presentation could be better but the sandwiches are delicious and fulling. Definately worth the wait for a table."}
{"text":"The best sandwich place in the world. I wish there was one in Austin, but that would be kind of wrong, I guess. The sandwiches all come (if you want) with fries and cole slaw ON THEM. This is the way steel mill and dock workers got them 100 years ago (or whatever) so they could finish during their short lunch breaks. And it is PERFECT! The corned beef is my favorite, but they're all good. The bread is Italian style, super light and flaky with crunchy crusts. Awesome. The cole slaw is vinegary, not the sweet mayonaise kind. Get a Coke or a beer and you are in heaven. I know I am--I was there a couple of weeks ago and it was as good as ever.

This is the best location, close to the original, if not in the same spot (the original was just a window). It's loud, crowded, and moves fast. The cranky woman who seats you is part of the deal. The counter guys are fast and really make sure you get what you want. The bathrooms are in the basement and kind of scary--don't go alone, ladies. This place is a national treasure. Best sammich ever and the pride of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd love Primanti Brothers. Places like this are my thing. But I give it a big MEH. I ordered the cheesesteak. Risky move for a Philly girl off her home turf. First mistake. How dare they call this patty of meat product cheesesteak!?! But okay, fine. Besides that, the fries are soggy and bland, and overwhelm the sandwich with their blandness. I pulled most of them off. The bread is bland and floppy -- not sturdy enough for it's job. The best part is the slaw which is a little zippy at least, but not enough to redeem this tower of bland."}
{"text":"It's an experience. But from the words of my husband, \"I wouldn't go here very often if I lived here.\" 

We stopped in after spending the night on a trip out east. We ordered the Philly cheese steak and turkey. I appreciated the fact that the waitress said they were big and we didn't need to order fries. They were more than enough to feed my husband, daughter and I! I did not like the slaw--I like sweeter slaw. I ended up scraping it off my two halves. The quality was so-so. I would recommend it for people just visiting the city but I personally would try something else next time I pass through town."}
{"text":"Alright internetz, I have a confession to make:

I can't stand this place.

My Pittsburgh friends will probably chide me for this...but I don't care.  It needs to be said.  I grew up in the small-ish town of Wheeling, WV.  It's about 45 minutes from Pittsburgh and I spent many weekends up there with family roaming the strip district and cheering on the Steelers.  I went to college in Pittsburgh and a few years after graduating moved back and lived in Pittsburgh again.  I've tried multiple Primanti locations.  I've tried it multiple times throughout my childhood and 20s.  I've tried different sandwiches.  I've tried it drunk.

I just...don't get it.

Maybe it's my hatred of cole slaw?  Maybe it's the fact that every time I've had one of these sandwiches the meat seems dried out, the bread seems stale, the fries are too greasy, and I just can't find anything to be excited about.  Nothing blows me away.  And I can appreciate a delicious, simple sandwich.  This just isn't it.

Probably one of the most over-hyped, over-rated places in the burgh.  Sorry yinz, I'm just not a fan.  Knocked it up to two stars only because the people working at the restaurants are uber friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Very mediocre at best...a major disappointment since we were looking forward to one of their \"legendary\" sandwiches. One of us got the \"Pittsburgher\"  (which reminded both of us of a salibury steak type of meat, not really a cheesesteak) and I got it with pastrami. The Pittsburger was poor and the other was barely passable.
They may be living on their reputation...  the current reality is a serious disappointment."}
{"text":"Had the Pittburgher.    Cheesesteak on thick-cut soft white bread with all the fixins (fries, coleslaw, lettuce, tomato on the sandwich).    Not bad, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.    Service was friendly and the food came out lightning-fast (less than 2 minutes). Cash only."}
{"text":"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!
The food is terrible, no flavor, dried, no sauce. The only sauce available is ketchup and hot sauce. I should have gone to subway. 
The service is terrible. She doesn't remember our order and just start throwing our sandwiches on the table and leave. We have to figure it out in our own. She had to open each sandwich and break them in half to see what inside and calling the name out. Who does that?! They are busy but they all have a big attitude here."}
{"text":"Very bad foods. No flavor, very dried and under-seasoned. 
Very bad service. They were rude. They had open each sandwich, break them into half, look into it to know what it is and start calling the name of the sandwich out at the table.  I do not recommend this place. I should have gone to subway."}
{"text":"we ordered the smallman street fries and ended up disappointed. they sounded waaayyy better on the menu. for some reason the market square primanti's taste the best out of all of them. i cant quite figure it out. even though i live in oakland, ill head to downtown for the Primanti's experience."}
{"text":"Average. I'm not big on the whole cole slaw-french fry sandwich thing but they are ok. Primanti's also has good wings. Also, their salad isnt too bad.

I often get cheese fries to go for lunch. You get a decent amount for $3.50 (for downtown standards). The only sucky thing is that the fries are normally cold.. not warm, cold. -_- they make up for by pouring scalding hot cheese sauce all over to mask the cold fries. Well played my friend. it doesnt stop me from coming once every 2 months"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros - doesn't need an introduction....they were on Man vs. Food, Pitt and Penn State has easy access to it now. Once you eat there, you'll probably love it provided you are occasionally ok with a full meal pressed into a single sandwich.  If you are a first time visitor to Pittsburgh and you like food, then you must visit the Primanti Bros in the Strip District.  The Strip District location is a solid 5 stars.  The original Primanti Bros location is able to easily overbuild the sandwiches and whatever else you order to give the food that signature character that these type of special unique region restaurants are able to provide.  The character is almost impossible to replicate, even by the remote locations.  The satellite locations are 3 to 4 stars each. They are trained in how to build the sandwiches with the same ingredients, but they usually come off as not being overbuilt the way the Strip location can constantly produce.  The satellite locations though do pull off the same flavors, and they do assemble the sandwiches correctly, so they get a 3 to 4 stars.  I highly highly recommend Primanti' son the Strip, especially if you are visiting from out of town for work or for play!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday since it seemed like they were the only ones open late with good recommendations from the locals. We walked into the restaurant and were greeted with a smoky atmosphere. This place is definitely the college go-to place for a Sammy! My boyfriend got the pitts-burger and I got the Capone. The pitts burger is this weird meatloaf-ish patty which was pretty disappointing as it was one of the most talked about sandwich. The only saving grace for the sandwich was the fact that it was stuffed with french fries and coke slaw. The Capone was wayyyyy better! Get this Sammy if you come here! I love the combo of the hot sausage with the cold cole slaw. Personally I think the fries were much and changed the texture of the sandwich. They should give you an option to have your fries on the side. Overall, fun experience but I prefer Ike's over this any day."}
{"text":"Stopped by Primanti Bros while I was visiting Pittsburgh with some friends. We were looking for a quick bite to eat before going out and this place hit the spot. I ordered the sirloin steak sandwich on the recommendation of the waitress. A lot of things looked really good on the menu so I needed a little direction. The meat was juicy and tasty, and was overall delicious. The remainder of the sandwich wasn't anything particularly special, but was good enough to leave me satisfied and full. The slaw inside the sandwich was a nice touch, and I also really enjoyed the fries stuffed into the sandwich as well. Beers were relatively cheap and there was plenty of parking around the restaurant. Definitely could see myself coming back to watch a football game or something similar to that."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, the burgers are amazing, and the service is even better. This is a must stop restaurant in Pennsylvania!"}
{"text":"Nope. Nope. NOPE. 
When I moved here, I got the \"Oh my ghad ya have to go to Pimanny's!\" 

After doing a search for Pimanny's, and the GPS asking if I meant Primanti's, I went to PRIMANTI'S. Actually, the boyfriend and I went to Primanti's. The boyfriend doesn't like a lot of stuff on his sandwich. He asked for the fries and slaw on the side. Enter first bad impression. \"You can't have it on the side!' The woman behind the counter snapped. Um, yeah, I can. I look around and notice that everything is served on wax paper, so I poke the boy and point to a patron's \"plate.\" So boyfriend says \"it's ok if you just pile it up next to the sandwich, I don't mind.\" She replies \"It comes on the sandwich. Not on the side.\" So needless to say, no slaw or fries for Mr. Boyfriend. At this point, I'm pissed. If you read my other reviews you know I work in customer service FOR TIPS. I don't care where I am, I don't care how it's served. This is bad service. We didn't ask for anything special or complicated. Whatever. I'm here, and he ordered, so I guess we are still eating. 

I ordered the fish. \"You want yours no slaw no fries too I bet, huh?\" Repress. Urge. To. Be. A. Jerk. \"No, as is will be fine, thanks.\" 

So it's Italian bread. Ok. The crust is hard, the bread gets soft with all the stuff on the sandwich. Eating these things is a hot mess. I don't mind a messy meal, but I don't get the appeal here. I understand the history, truck drivers needed to eat on the go, everything went on the sandwich, problem solved. Well, I'm not a truck driver. I'm not on the go. I'm sitting at your bar, wondering how the hell anyone ever ate this while they were driving without wearing it. Anyway, it wasn't epic. The fish was plain, the slaw was plain, the fries were fries, and the bread was meh. The lady came and asked my boyfriend \"how's your sandwich?\" He shrugged \"It's all right.\" Whoa, apparently that's grossly offensive language or something. \"It's all right?! It's the best around!'' No, maam. Not by a long shot. 

I'll pass. Thanks but no thanks. People say \"well, we grew up here, it's what we eat. It's better when you're drunk.\" Ok, I'll keep that in mind. Next time I'm hammered and want to eat a mediocre sandwich with a side of crappy service, I'll be sure to stop on by."}
{"text":"It's a Pittsburgh staple..  There is no better slaw in the world.  One of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"We come to Pittsburgh once a year for a family vacation. This restaurant was recommended by a front desk employee at our hotel. 

Their sandwiches are like no other. They are the best sandwiches I've ever had. They are served on French bread and are topped with cheese, cole slaw, and fries. This odd combination is surprisingly delicious. The service is very friendly and fast. Their dessert is great, too. 
I hope to come back next year."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and courteous waitstaff. The food is very good and I will definitely be a regular there. Service can be slow when the restaurant is busy, but that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Here in Pittsburgh visiting friends and was brought here for a meal.

Wow! Delicious, delicious food. Girlfriend and I shared their Smallman St. Fries and I had the pastrami sandwich, she had grilled chicken and cheese. All sandwiches come on delicious Italian toasted bread and has French fries in it as well!

Totally went into food coma from this. As a fan of sandwiches, these took the prize. Not to mention that as stacked a sandwich as it was, it was minimally messy! Would totally come back here on a future visit to Pittsburgh!

Almost forgot to mention, awesome service!"}
{"text":"It's one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! There is a big menu to choose from.  Even though Primanti sandwiches are not the healthiest, there are healthier foods to choose from.

FOOD:  I always choose their fish sandwich(not the colossal one).  Now if you're not familiar with Primanti's sandwiches, think about a sandwich using sliced Italian bread, with french fries, and coleslaw on top of the fried fish.  The french fries are like boardwalk fries that are a bit soggy, and the coleslaw is vinegar based and sweet.  It may not sound appetizing, but it's delicious!  It's also a huge sandwich, so you may not be a pretty sight when eating a Primanti's sandwich.  With your sandwich you can also get a slice of pizza for $1.  You can't beat that!

They're open late, so get  Primanti's sandwich after a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"Recommend by the staff at Atlantic aviation when asked about a local establishment. Got there right before the lunch rush so there wasn't much activity at that time. Ordered a chicken gyro with fries and the food arrived within a matter of minutes. The chicken gyro had great taste and the portions were more than enough. The rest of the menu items looked inviting and would stop here again next time I'm in the Pittsburgh airport area."}
{"text":"My first time there  I am visiting from New York. I loved my Italian it was perfect the fries were very good I look forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE EATING??!!! I was SO excited to eat here, we walked at least 2 miles to get here and for what?! Terrible service, TERRIBLE food.- and i was starving so it must have been REALLY bad. There were so many other restaurants that visually looked better but we sat here because of all the reviews we read about the Origional Primanti Bro. 
Without being dramatic- I ready to go to Mc Donalds afterwards but I ate too much of the nasty food because I kept thinking \"its got to get better soon.\"  :( so sad"}
{"text":"Just absolutely amazing. The pizza has come a long way over the years and it's better than ever. The sandwiches are always top notch and huge. You can't find better deals anywhere in Pittsburgh. The happy hour specials and atmosphere are great too. Love this place."}
{"text":"Can you really be disappointed in a place that puts fries and coleslaw on their sandwiches?  No way.  The bread was perfect to hold my monstrous sandwich together.  I need to try other options the next time that I'm back.  

We were there with a large group for lunch and the service was good.  We will be back since it's a Pittsburgh staple."}
{"text":"For being such a staple in the PITT- I wasn't blown away. Maybe it was my high expectations, or the size of the sandwich- but when it comes to making my mouth water- it just didn't create pools of drool like I anticipated. Turns out- we were eating with a 6 year old who ordered perogies, and I LOVED them (a lot more than my sandwich). Don't get me wrong- the sandwich was delicious, and the bf ate his and half of mine (that's a lot of food)- but it's not in my top 10 best sandwiches I've ever tasted- come on Pittsburgh! Don't let me down!

Also didn't dig the paper cups- made the water taste like... paper (that's not a good thing). However- friendly service and lively atmosphere made the experience a good one, and I definitely recommend trying their HUGE sandwiches if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely overrated, I had higher expectations after hearing about this place.  It was way too busy for the quality of food.  I think there has to be a better place when sober.  I think I would love it drunk, but not too much beef and fries had no taste to them.  Staff and customers were nice otherwise I'd only have given it one star.  I wonder if they suffer from quality decrease due to popularity because I definitely was expecting better.  Location is great with easy parking, I would try it out as an out of towner maybe, but I would look elsewhere for lunch or dinner and keep this in the pocket for late night dining after drinking."}
{"text":"This is more of a 2.5 stars but I'm usually a nice guy.  Maybe I had high expectations or maybe I'm a big sandwich snob, but I just wasn't impressed. 

So I got to try the Black Angus Top Sirloin and the Pitts-Burger Cheese Steak and my first thought was, they kind of taste the same.   I'm a HUGE sandwich fan and I believe the core of the sandwich should be the meat and 2nd should be the bread.  So with that said, my favorite part of this sandwich was the coleslaw.  Between the starchy fries, the large slices of the bread and fatty meat, the coleslaw was absolutely essential and I enjoyed it.  I just felt like the sandwich was bland and it was just one heap of food and bite after bite I was wanting the meat to stand out a bit more but I feel like the addition of fries kind of killed the sandiwch for me.  Not only did it add more grease to the mix but it also kind of made it seem like there was more bread (due to the starchiness) than there really was. 

I'm not opposed to visiting again, but, unfortunately, I can't say I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I love Primanti's, I take all visitors to this restaurant, it's the original!

You can't go wrong with the ham & cheese.  Sometimes I mix it up and go with the double egg.  I don't recommend the steak, my dad said it was like eating a hockey puck.  But the Italian bread is fresh, the slaw is crunchy, the fries are perfect, and the Iron City is cold!

If you go on a Saturday, be prepared to wait.  To me it's worth it.  Also, don't expect good service, to me, that's just part of the experience."}
{"text":"Counting can be a problem
Ordered the 8 wings for $5 off the after 9 menu and got 6 wings.  I love posting after a few 23 oz beers and two wings short,lol."}
{"text":"Yes. Post Cubs loss we trekked down Penn to the original location, man was it worth it. I thought it would be pretty good, but it was everything I'd dreamed of and more. The coleslaw and fries in my sandwich (I got the Kielbasa) made the bite layered and dripping with flavor. Usually I don't like white bread but it really worked here, and they gave me a side of perfect cheese sauce to dip into. To top it off, even though it was packed with drunk people the service was great and they even hooked up Chicagoans up with pickle back shots! Truly a legendary Yinzer establishment!"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents shortly after Primantis had opened for the day. It was my first ever experience with Primanti Bros, as well as my parents. The waiter we had (Matt) was an awesome dude who explained everything to my sometimes picky parents to a T. He gave some solid recommendations and wasn't overbearing or intrusive.

Anyways. We got some wings as appetizers, 5 Spicy and Hot, 5 Buffalo Ranch - both solid. Recommend. Wings were good, had enough meat to them and the sauces were both on point.

We ordered a Roast Beef and Cheese, Cajun Chicken, and Pitts-burger. All were fantastic and more than enough food. Fries and coleslaw on a sandwich is what made me leary of Primanti Bros at first, but it really made the sandwich.

Couldn't have been more satisfied with the waitstaff, the kitchen staff, the food, or the atmosphere. Great first Primanti Bros experience, I hope it carries through the other locations!"}
{"text":"I like Primanti's at Moon. I've gone there for lunch, dinner and happy hour and have never been disappointed. It's not the same experience as going to the original but I still enjoy it. The staff has always been friendly and the service is quick.
They always have good drink specials and the menu is extensive. My husband always gets the capicola with an egg. My favorite salad is the grilled chicken salad with the hot wing sauce. And recently I got hooked to their bbq chicken pizza. 

 I ordered a sandwich to go and it was ready within 5 minutes during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Used to come here at least once a month if not more when I went to college. Still get the cravings for it as it is your Pittsburgh tradition. Whenever I come back to town, Primanti Brothers is a stop that I must knock off my to do list. The combination of the bread, tomato, cole slaw, fries, cappicola and cheese are unlike any other. I've even tried to make one of these when I lived in St. Louis but it just was not the same."}
{"text":"How can you not like Primanti Brothers. I need to hit up this place whenever I'm in town. The combination of the cole slaw, fries, tomato, italian bread, cap and cheese are to die for. I've tried to make this sandwich when I lived in St. Louis after I graduated and I can never get it the same because the italian bread is near impossible to find there and the cole slaw is just so much better home made. Let's just get this straight, this sandwich is enormous. The cap and cheese is their number 1 best seller. They have the philly cheesesteak written down as their number 2 best but don't have anything mentioning the number 1. Well. It's the cap and cheese. Oh man. Have one of these with a nice bottle of Yuengling and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered the black angus top sirloin steak and cheese for 7.99$ cause the people next to us recommended it however it was nothing special. Way too much coleslaw. Def split it and get ice cream for dessert somewhere else. Only good part was an outdoor concert going on just outside of it!"}
{"text":"Glad to be checking it off from my Pittsburgh to-do list but probably won't come back. The sandwiches were very bland and the fries inside were kind of cold. Everything is pretty cheap here though and you do get a lot of food with the price."}
{"text":"It was a neat experience but it didn't have much flavor. Great decor. The service was bad but it was really crowded. I tried ordering fries, as in an extra side...but the waitress took our order and as she was walking away she says fries are on the sandwich. Yes, I know...but I wanted more but it was too late, she was gone and moved on."}
{"text":"I am quite the Primanti's expert, as the BF and I met while working in the Oakland store 10 years ago, and we are extremely brand loyal.  

I really enjoyed getting a drink at this location.  It was packed to the rafters, but we got good service for a good price.  The small guy with glasses who was cooking put on a great show and was fun to talk to.  If we hadn't gorged on 5 Guys ten minutes earlier, I would have ordered myself a Double Egg and Cheese."}
{"text":"As a former Primanti Brother's employee I can tell you that working at Primanti's is no easy job.

This Primanti's is much bigger than the one in Oakland, and you can usually find good seating.  The grilling area is in the back, away from the bar, and you can sit there, too.  

Sandwiches are just as good as they always are.  Beer is what you pay for.  I think their well drinks are a little overpriced.  And I miss how Primanti's used to be... before all the fried pickles and pizza and liquor... I liked the days of just sandwiches and beer.

The staff is pretty quick too, considering how busy they can be!"}
{"text":"The bleached, suburban, TGIFriday's version of Primanti Bros.  If you are coming in from out of town, or touring people from out of town, bring them to either the Southside, Oakland, or Strip District Primanti Bros. as this one does the food right (albeit the menu has expanded to include a bunch of other items beyond the classic menu), but the atmosphere is the same as any other suburban chain restaurant.  Get the authentic experience in a city Primantis."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service this time, saw our waitress once, no refill and the sandwich was tiny in comparison to last time.   Will come back, yes - it's still the best. Just not sure what happened, I was very disappointed to say the least. I rode a bike over 200 miles and was ready for some food and drink. We went up the street for additional beverage :-("}
{"text":"Years ago, while watching PBS, I stumbled across the greatest show I had ever seen. I can't remember the name but it was essentially one mans travel guide of American cities seen through their signature sandwich. This, before the food and travel network onset if foodie travel shows. 
Needless to say, the chresesteak was prominently featured as well as NYC hot dogs and the Maine Loster Roll, to name a few. I immediately made it my goal to seek some of these gems out.

One that caught my eye was the Primanti Brothers sandwich in Pittsburgh. So much so that when a Pittsburgh road trip was mentioned by a friend, even though I couldn't think of any reason other than sports to visit Pittsburgh, I jumped at the chance and reasoned that at least I can cross that pile of deliciousness off my list.

I'll interrupt this review to say that there are many cool things to do in Steel City that I was unaware of, so put it on your \"To Do\" list of places to visit. I visited the Strip location, which is also the original.

Here, you have the option of a sit down restaurant experience or just grabbing takeout and or sitting in the cafe section. We chose to order at the counter and sit nearby to eat. 

Based on my own preferences, as well as the suggestions of others ( both on Yelp and by other patrons there) we both chose the corned beef. It took a matter of minutes and I LOVED that it was delivered to us on a simple square of wax paper. A nice touch, that allowed us to be messy and able to be cleaned up easy afterwards. For the uninitiated, the gimmick of primanti bros is a hot coldcut sandwich on Italian bread slices with L&T and coleslaw and fries pressed in.

The Corned Beef Primanti didn't disappoint.  In my opinion, it had the perfect meat/bread/cheese/ topping ratio. It really hit the spot. I'd go as far to say that if we did nothing else in PBurgh, it was worth the trip.

My friend was a little nonplussed that their bathroom stalls didn't have doors but I didn't go there to poop, I went there to do the opposite! You should too! Put it on your bucket list and get your hands on one."}
{"text":"Where to begin? My salad was disorganized and made as if I were having my lunch at McDonald's. I got the steak salad on a very small plate with rubbery meat and cheap lettuce, a pile of onions and a pile of cheese next to it with not enough salad dressing, plastic forks and knives. Waitress wasn't very friendly. Won't ever go back."}
{"text":"It's a definite must if you are in Pittsburgh, and definitely great to be at the original location. Their sandwich style is an original. Although, I thought my sandwich to be just a tad on the bland side, you can change it up using hot sauce, etc."}
{"text":"I'm impressed by a no 'messing around' kind of establishment, they serve you quickly, feed you quickly; love it!  get you in and out.  the day we went the service was really friendly (and quick!), great chili, sandwiches...  Will return next time in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had the double steak Primanti Bros famous sandwich. It was good, coleslaw, French fries, tomatoes and steak. All stacked into an Italian sandwich. Yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Let's see I think this this is one of those places you just have to say you have been. Honestly the burger or per Mantee sandwich it's self was lacking in flavor but put together quite well from the very nice bread to the well cook fries the slaw and I got the corn beef style it was huge the reason I am giving this restaurant for stars is because we had great service I really feel like we got a bang for our buck I believe $15 dollars is the cheapest that I have spent on a meal In a long while."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, took over 15 minutes to get asked our drink order. Food was mediocre, cheap meat and very dry. Waited for the check for over 30 minutes since we were not checked in on by our waiter but one time and the restaurant was not busy. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"So an honest review.  Bland.  Service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made.  I ordered the new black bean burger sandwich.  Bread not toasted, burger tasted a lot like my morning star black bean burger that I get frozen.  Coleslaw was a lot better with the hot sauce I smothered on it.  The best part was by far the fries which weren't all that great.  I am glad that those were home made.  I picked all the bread off ate mostly the fries and was not very impressed.  The beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating.  I'm not a big foodie but I like my food taste better.  I still ate because I was hungry and it's not uneatable, just bland and kinda of boring.  It's still a must do in Pitts so go ahead and do it at least once, but skip the rest of your stay."}
{"text":"sandwich heaven. quick. affordable. heaven. yummmmmmmmmmm. yum."}
{"text":"If you visit pgh, going to Pirmanti's is a must. A sandwich just isn't a sandwich without fries and 'slaw heaped on it.  I personally recommend the  roast beef. It would rock if we had one in Atlanta"}
{"text":"Am I authoring YET ANOTHER  \"Pirmanti bros a Pittsburgh tradition blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda\"  type review ? Guess you'll have read on to find out, right ?

This was my first time visiting the harmarville location.. 
It was super busy; which probably has to do with the fact that primantis is relatively  close to the PA turnpike. We chose to visit on a Saturday night of a holiday weekend (xgiving)  And it just so happened that a   pens game was in progress.  Hockey games and bar traffic absolutely can't be taken for granted in western PA .  

 Our food arrived in a timely Manner. Despite the fact the fact the place was packed. 10 minute wait for seating.  I don't what make of our waitress telling us that certain menu items might take up to an hour to come out.. After mulling it over i guess I'll  err on the side of good customer service :) ( foolish is man who has mortons expectations on mcdonalds budget) 

Anyway I ordered sweet sausage sandwich sans   the cheese of course. Kudos to my waitress for getting my \"no cheese\" request right the first time in an extremely loud and seemingly chaotic bar environment. Everything  Tasted great. My sandwich came with a ton of that  vinigear based slaw , and fries!"}
{"text":"Easy 4stars. Idk bout it being 5 stars. Fries are a bit too greasy and the steak/beef sandwich (not their signature sandwich) is a bit of a mess. 

Don't get me wrong the flavors are good but it's like when people wear too many designer labels to create the facade that they're wealthy. Yeah, that's their sandwich. Don't need all that hoopla. IMO"}
{"text":"Service was fast! We ordered a fish sandwich to share - huge portions so you probably won't be able to finish a whole sandwich by yourself.

They were great about the parking situation. Cars had to be double parked because of the lack of space, but if you parked someone in, one of the servers will just scream the make and color of your vehicle so everyone can come eat here!"}
{"text":"Not sure that I could eat here more than once every 10 years, but I'll take my chances. I suppose it helps that my doctor's office is 2,500 miles away and the chances are slim that I'll run into him here."}
{"text":"This might be the worst restaurant in the area! The service was awful the waitress was rude and disrespectful. She couldn't take a simple order of boneless BBQ wings right instead I got bone-in dry rub with a ridiculous amount of nasty grease at the bottom. The chili cheese nachos didn't come with cheese, the chips wee soggy and the only thing on it was beans. Overall this was the worst experience at a restaurant in a long time. Gross place."}
{"text":"Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. 

Think a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.

First, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. 

My dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \"bacon\" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  

I will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, though not as good as the hype claims. I got the kielbasa sandwich, which was good, though the fries were soggy.  The service was superb, and though the place was mostly empty when we arrived, it was totally packed when we left."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  On several recommendations since we came to town we decided to try this place.  I can definately see what all the hype is about!  

My buddy and I ordered two sandwiches and split them, the cappicola and the pastrami.  They were great.  I preferred the pastrami slightly over the other but they were both great.  The waitress said the best way to eat them is to put hot sauce right on the slaw.  Great recommendation.

The bread was bulky but soft and held up nicely to the last bite.  The slaw that they used was great and like nothing I've had before.  It was vinegar based but not too strong.  

It was a cool atmosphere and they had an outdoor seating area.  The staff was fun and energetic.  Great late night food after a night of drinking.  I would definately recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Starving because I hadn't eaten lunch and being in downtown Pittsburgh, Primanti Brothers was suggested.  I had tried a Pittsburgh salad before (a tasty combination of steak, french fries and riveria dressing) but had only heard about the bizarre sandwich that combined coleslaw, fries and whatever meat you chose.  

We went to the original location in the Strip District. Since it was after 5:00, most of the shops and vendors in that area were closed, but I made note of the fact that I would need to return to this eclectic community filled with food vendors (including many ethnic varieties), Pittsburgh sports memorabilia, arts and culture venues and speciality boutiques to name just a few.  

The menu at Primanti Brothers was simple but I still had a hard time deciding which sandwich to try.  I was assured by our friendly server that regardless of what I chose I would not be disappointed so I quickly surveyed the menu and chose turkey breast and cheese.  The server told the story about how the original sandwich was constructed so workers could combine their favorite ingredients into one easy to handle lunch package.  It was enjoyable to know a little more about the history of the sandwich I was about to try.  

When our sandwiches arrived, I was amazed at the size.  Even though I was hungry, I doubted I could finish.  I took my first bite and knew I'd be back to this restaurant.  Not only was the sandwich tasty, but somehow the fries maintained some crispness and the bread didn't get soggy!  I ate the whole sandwich (probably quicker than I should have) and had plenty of praise to pass on to our server.  I can't wait to go back and try other varieties!"}
{"text":"It seems Primanti purists dislike suburban locations because of the increased menu options and space, but as a mom of twins, it's one of the reasons I like this location. 
The restaurant is split into the bar side and restaurant side.  Both sides have TVs and similar seating but the bar side tends to be louder.  They do have high chairs and kids menus available which is a huge plus in my book these days.  
The menu has the reasonably prices traditional Primanti sandwiches.  You can also add things like egg or double meat.  The menu also has wings, various appetizers, salads, pizzas and sandwiches.  There are daily specials as well.  I'm a wing lover and Sunday is 50 cent wings!
Service was friendly (although a bit slow) and all of our food was as promised on the menu and quite tasty.
Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"Every single thing is just really really greasy and heavy. Though I'm sure they spend plenty of time perfecting the meat, after a few bites, the only thing that registers with me is the oil. Definitely worth a try, but anything on the menu will not help you maintain an even remotely healthy lifestyle."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's classic! Must try!! When we visited Ft Lauderdale from Pittsburgh we asked for food suggestions and our uber driver suggested here! We laughed and told him we're from the original home of it!"}
{"text":"Great location. good service. Food is always consistent and quick! Highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"great food...great service! we got in and out of there in time for our hockey game and the food was better than we expected."}
{"text":"I've been to Primanti Brothers a couple times before in Cranberry Township, but yesterday was the 1st time at the original location in the Strip district. My wife and I went around 12:30 on a Friday afternoon. It was jam packed, but we got a seat in less than 5 minutes. Our food arrived in less than 3 minutes! Amazing fast. It was a very tasty meal. We shared a pastrami and a sirloin steak sandwiches. So tasty and filling!  We paid our modest sized bill and left, probably 20 minutes for the whole visit. My only small complaint was the noisiness of the place. Great meal!"}
{"text":"Wow..that is all that really needs to be said.  I was able to visit this location on my return to Indianapolis from the east coast when I had a four hour layover in Pittsburgh.  I walked down on the wednesday evening I was in town to find the place about 45% full when I got there around 8:30pm.  I sat at the bar area and after reviewing the menu went with the roast beef sandwhich.  And what a meal it was, not just a sandwhich but a meal.

As I sat there trying to finish the sandwich the placed cleared out to just me and the three guys working and wow again what great guys.  We talked sports and such and slowly the place filled back up to almost full.  They let me sit and watch the Pirates game and talked baseball.  The sandwhich was great, the service was super and the chance to check out a Pittsburgh legend was worth the 4 hour layover I had..."}
{"text":"If you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them, go for it.   But no good sandwich needs nonsense like that.  These are not very good sandwiches to begin with and adding soggy fries doesn't help.  Not to mention the bread is not fresh and is just a thick, bland wonder-bready thing.  

I appreciate that they're not aiming at  customers like me.  Big sloppy sandwiches are fun for a lot of people so I hate to be a party pooper, but I don't think the quality is there."}
{"text":"Very good big sandwiches. But the employees act like they want to die. They should smile more."}
{"text":"I like trying well-known places in various cities. I like it even better when they actually taste good!

Such is the case with Primanti Brothers. You get a gigantic, unique sandwich piled with cole slaw and french fries for a decent price. And it tastes good! I had the triple cheese one. The french fries are tasty and done well, and the cole slaw is peppery and vinegary and that's it, which I like. 

It wasn't crowded for a late dinner on Monday night, and service was decent. I think it's worth checking out, if just for how different the sandwiches are (and greasy delicious)."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Got the pastrami.  Fresh bread.  Well seasoned pastrami.  Loved the slaw and fries on the sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like mediocre food and cigar smoke in your face while you eat. Seriously, what a hype job. I much rather have a media noche or a Cuban Sandwich in a cafeteria in Hialeah, FL. 

The cole slaw and the fries had NO taste whatsoever. The steak and cheese? A frozen Salisbury steak not unlike anything you'd find in the frozen foods section of your local grocery store. The cheese? We still have a search party going. They can't find it.

For real, save your time, money and taste buds. Subway is a much better alternative. That is all."}
{"text":"I'm a tourist, so sure i'll stop at a tourist spot.  I guess Sunday at noon is a good time to go, because it wasn't that crowded and we were seated right away.  My wife ordered the #2 most popular menu item (I forget what it was). I asked what was popular, the pastrami, cheese and egg. So that's what I got.  We were served quickly, no complaints there.  My sandwich was fine, didn't blow me away.  It had good bread, a TON of vinegar coleslaw, some pastrami , fries and an egg.  My wife felt hers needed salt, so she salted it.  We ordered cheap coffee , as it was our first meal of the day.  And it was cheap coffee.  They served booze, looks like there have a full  bar.   Our waitress never checked in on us, refilled our coffee or anything. It's worth popping by for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"Guess I will be adding yet another \"meh\" review for this place on Yelp. I'm not really sure how to review this--it's not terrible, but I also definitely don't think it's one of those must-go places for people coming to Pittsburgh. The best word that I can think of is probably \"gimmicky.\" You hear all the raves about the place, you go in and order your Pittsburgher cheese steak loaded with coleslaw and fries, and you either go \"wow, this place is awesome\" or \"how the hell is this so famous?\"

I probably belong in the latter category. Personally, I'm not sure why these things are any special. If I really craved something like the Pittsburgher cheese steak, I could just as well go to any other cheese stake place, order fries and coleslaw on the side, and mash them all together to call it a day. That said, many people love Primanti for a feel-good, nostalgic type of experience, rather than the food itself; I'm not a native so I'm not qualified to comment on this.

In any case, the cheese steak itself is also pretty meh as a food item--meat is pretty bland, fries are soggy, and coleslaw is a bit overwhelming. Given a choice, I'd much rather eat the stuff separately at a place that makes them better. The place is also surprisingly small on the inside; there is an upper level, but the spacing between the tables on the first floor is really cramped. I guess it makes for a good atmosphere on Stiller days or late-night bar hopping."}
{"text":"Not my type of place.  I was told to check this place out as a visitor to Pittsburgh.  Guess its a Pittsburgh thing.  Didn't care for my sandwich at all.  I got the number one seller Sirloin sandwich.  All sandwiches come with fries and cole slaw built into the sandwich.  After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to taste the slaw.  Mine was tasteless.  There was hardly any meat, felt like I was eating a slaw and fry sandwich.  My husband got the corned beef, he felt the same.  Our boys got the chili, which they liked.  Again I don't know if it's a Pittsburgh thing, but the employees never really acknowledge you, we sat at the counter and saw many workers passing by.  Not one smile or look in our direction.  We were there at a slow time around 2:30 pm."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype leading up to a visit to Primanti Bros.

I was very excited and wanted badly to love it.  The place was packed, but the service was friendly and on top of it the whole time we were there, despite having a group of seven.

The Pitts-burgher: fries, coleslaw, cheese steak --all on a single sandwich.  I expected a taste explosion in my mouth, but somehow, everything just seemed to cancel everything out.  The Cheese-steak was just a burger.  The fries were mushy and undefined.  The only thing I could kind of taste was the slaw, and it was not my favorite.  

I'm saddened to say, I left half my sandwich completely untouched on the table when I left."}
{"text":"Only came here for drinks, but even as I looked around, I didn't think the food looked extremely tasty. It just looks like your normal bar food -- burgers and sandwiches and wraps."}
{"text":"So I found this place on the Food Network.  My God thank you!  I live in NY and was on holiday in Pitt.  I looked up the places to go and Man vs Food told me I had to go here.

The place has a divey awesome feel to it.  The sandwiches which are basically every meat under the sun on bread, with slaw and fries on the sandwich served on wax paper are super delicious.

I had the kielbasa and a beer.  Even though the sandwiches are huge, I wanted another.  They taste so good.  Anyone from out of town has to come here.  The only thing I didn't like was that now back in NY, I can't have one."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not the appropriate demographic for this restaurant but am wholly unimpressed with the food options as I don't eat red meat. The turkey sandwich perhaps had a slice of turkey on it but I can't be sure. It was mostly cabbage and soggy French fries (which I generally like tremendously). Honestly, just gross."}
{"text":"This place isn't for a light lunch. Their famous sandwiches include a variety of grilled meats (the cheese steak its second-best seller) with french fries, cole slaw, and tomatoes all squeezed between two soft slices of freshly-cut Italian bread. Rather than cool, mayo-based slaw, an Italian oil-based slaw is used that adds a spicy zing to the sandwich. It's a great meal on the go for game day, or you can watch it on one of the TVs surrounding the bar. It's a greasy handful, but you don't go to Primanti's to be healthy. You go to be full."}
{"text":"So, I moved to Pittsburgh about a year and a half ago. Everyone told me how great Primantis was.

O have tried .
Almost all of them now and I will admit, I like the place. 

Monroeville, awesome.
Downtown, awesome.
A couple others, awesome.

Moon township primantis? Awful.

If you want some where to drink beer, sure, go.

If you want somewhere for a family to eat, avoid this location.

The service is terrible. Shame on me for giving them so many tries.

I understand clearing tables for more people to sit, I'm sure you need traffic to make money.

However, I am in a party of 10 in the main dining area closest to the hostess podium at 3 last Sunday and the waitress was terrible.

We had no room on our table and had to start putting things on a table behind us.

Another thing....if you are going to have a wing special, don't be so upset when people order them!!!!!!

The time before this we came in and asked for wings and the waiter said you were out.

I then saw a party of 4 sit next to us and order 50 and their waitress ordered them and brought them out???"}
{"text":"After seeing this  on Food Network, I always wanted to go there, (the original location) well, I finally did and it was well worth it. You pick the meat, they make the sandwich. I chose pastrami which came between two thick cut slices of fresh Italian bread. Under the bread, in addition to the meat was a nice slice of tomato, a generous helping of a vinegar based cole slaw, provolone cheese and a mound of home cut perfectly cooked and seasoned french fries. Severed fast and friendly, but be careful.. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give 0 stars, cause this place deserves it. It's an embarrassment to Primanti's. Heck, it's an embarrassment to sandwiches. They should honestly close this branch because it's only giving Primanti Bros. a bad name. The food is not even close to representing what Primanti's on 18th street stands for. I'd recommend that anyone who's in the mood for comfort food in Oakland go to Uncle Sam's before they molest their pallet with this garbage."}
{"text":"It's good if you're in a pinch (or don't have cash) but do yourself a favor and hit-up the original location on 18th street. Seriously, you could walk there...and trust me, you'll need the exercise.."}
{"text":"I actually thought it was going to be bigger...and no I don't have a huge appetite as I just liked the novelty of it.  The cold slaw on it was really tasty but other than that I can't say it was the best deli sandwich I have ever had.  This location was cramped and a little dingy...not sure if it's better elsewhere but this is on campus pretty much."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said about a Primante Bros.? It is a cultural experience that can't be missed if you are in the Pittsburgh area.

This particular visit was at the Monroeville restaraunt. It was a welcome spot after walking around all day at the convention center. Speaking of which, this place is in easy driving or walking distance of the mall and convention center.

Of course I have heard of the famous Primante sandwiches so I had to order the standard with double meat, egg, and onions. Wow! Absolutely unreal. 

This was a huge sandwich. We were warned not to use silverware and once it was picked up, we weren't to set it down. I loved that from the waitress.

A friend also ordered a small pizza to go along with his sandwich. It was one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. He remarked that it reminded him of the pizza he use to have when he was in Italy for the Army. 

I truly have nothing bad to say about the place. They had my favorite Sam Adams on tap. The waitress was great. The atmosphere was excellent. I would drive the six hour round trip just to experience it again."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and horrible food! Don't waste your money. I got the fried pickles and steak salad. Both were terrible."}
{"text":"In light of keeping an open mind I've tried their sandwich twice. It was actually worse the second time. Huge slices of white bread, a large clump of under cooked french fry's and a meat disc make up their #1 sandwich. 
Service was okay even though they were very busy to say the least."}
{"text":"A sandwich with french fries inside? Yeah, that's something I can get behind.

My buddy took me here after a perfect Pittsburgh day: Pirates game followed by Primanti Bros. After a booze-soaked day there's nothing better than a greasy, amazing sandwich filled with potato pieces. 

The bartender here was super nice and brought us our grub really quickly. He also included some cheesy fries fo' free, because that's just how the 'burgh rolls.

You gotta stop here if you're rolling through Pittsburgh and this location is pretty swell."}
{"text":"We were the first ones to arrive on a Saturday morning at 11am. This was a perfect stop to shake off the cobwebs from a friends wedding the night before. 

I always enjoy the cheese combo. It's served with the best fries, coleslaw, and amazing French bread. For those visiting Pittsburgh and Ft Lauderdale, you must give it a try! After all, it is a Pittsburgh staple!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the Pitts-burger at Primanti Bros and it did not disappoint. The crunch from the cole slaw and fries worked so well with the runny egg and juicy beef patty. Damn do I love Primanti sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop off PA turnpike if you don't want travel plaza fast food.  Massive sandwiches which require a strategy for eating unless you break down and use a knife and fork.  All the sandwiches & salads come with French fries in them which is tastier than you'd think.  Loved the tots.  And sweet tea!"}
{"text":"A local favorite.. inexpensive food.  We had the Nacho Grande to start.. awesome.. 4 of us polished this off in minutes! 
Really good service.. had the New Yorker and the Pitt Burger.. Awesome!"}
{"text":"It's a big sandwich with the fries and slaw thrown in. It's big on volume, but not as big on flavor. It was interesting to eat though. If you're in the area you gotta try it at least once. Otherwise I'd head out for something with a little more flavor.

BTW, seat yourself and then the waiter will come to you, not the other way around."}
{"text":"Really about 3.5 but it was definitely worth going to. Wife and I split the pastrami (could've gotten extra meat for $2). The pastrami is very good, the ordinary sandwich bread works and the coleslaw is spot on. I'm a crunch french fry guy so the soft french fries were disappointing but all in all a solid sandwich. Lots of history in this place and the surrounding streets are cool to walk around too. 

Will definitely be back next time we are in the 'burgh, I'm just wondering if they would be offended if I asked for crispy fries."}
{"text":"After much recommendation we stopped here for lunch while we were in Pittsburgh for a wedding the other day.  I had never been there before so I asked the waitress for recommendations and she had suggested the angus beef or pastrami.  I had turkey on my mind so I ordered the turkey sandwich and my husband had the angus beef.  When we got the sandwiches both of them were overstuffed with the meat, French fries, cole slaw and tomatoes. I asked for my sandwich with no tomatoes and the coleslaw on the side and a side of ranch.  The sandwiches came in fresh Italian bread and with lots of napkins.  The sandwiches were definitely something to experience and very filling."}
{"text":"I was sucked in by the hype. I had a day in Pittsburgh and HAD to give it a try. I got the turkey sandwich, bland, boring, and no bang! I tried to add hot sauce (at the suggestion of my server) to make it more flavorful but it did little to help. Overall don't do it! There are many other places to try downtown Pittsburgh. 

**Side note** the servers were great!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Went there on a busy summer Sunday afternoon. I've visited there before during the week, and it was only marginally better then, so they blew their shot at redemption. Service was surly, sarcastic and inefficient. Sandwich (Pitts-Burgher cheese steak) was just okay-fries were fresh and hot (maybe I got lucky) and the cole slaw was tasty, but the pitifully small quantity of meat (maybe 2 oz. per sandwich) was galling; basically, I had a small cole slaw sandwich between two slices of cold white bread.  This place is incredibly overrated-honestly, don't subscribe to the hype and just skip it.  What a shame.

For what it's worth, I recently went to the Fort Lauderdale Beach location, and had a completely different experience entirely;  service was friendly and attentive, and my sandwich actually had meat in it!  I was very satisfied, and intend to visit that location again. Not sure how they lost the handle in Pittsburgh, and I sincerely hope they get it back."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant. Atmosphere is lively, the staff is friendly and attentive. I like visiting local culture restaurants, especially ones that have a long history in the area. This one did not disappoint! The food options were awesome. I'm always trying to decide between a salad and something with fries...they have salad with fries on top!!! I'm in food heaven! My hubs got the spicy chicken sandwich with fries on it and it too was a hit. Also got to eat outside and enjoy the Market atmosphere. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! Great place to meet up with friends. Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Good solid bread, pretty well cooked meat, cheese, fries and coleslaw! 
That pretty much sums up the experience. Taste was very good and the quantity was amazing. The only reason I took off a star is I found it dry! A sort of gravy or anything would have made it earn a star more. After a few bites it kind of felt sticking in the throat. Except that everyone on the table enjoyed the meal. A memorable one indeed. Primanti in a way defines pittsburgh. Its all well and good but somewhere it lacks something that we arent able to identify. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple, you must try a Primanti's sandwich whenever you visit the city.  I grew up in the area and wasn't much of a foodie in my youth (I didn't even have buffalo wings or Chinese food until I was 18), and I didn't care for their sandwiches when I had them as a kid.  Fast-forward twenty years and I love them... the vinegar based cole slaw is the perfect compliment to their hand cut fries.  I get the capicola with fried egg and it's spectacular.  I can't help but do a happy wiggle in my seat when I have my first bite.  We had Primanti's twice in as many days on our last trip to Pittsburgh.  You won't be disappointed... and if you are, you don't love food."}
{"text":"Go here if you've never been.  It's good to take people from out of town.  I am not personally a huge fan.  It's crowded all of the time and the food is pretty low quality, but it's definitely a Pittsburgh Tradition."}
{"text":"First place to eat in Pittsburgh.  Gotta love it!  Roast beef is the way to go.  An all in one sandwich"}
{"text":"We were at this location for lunch and despite it being a rough day our server Rachel was fantastic. My spicy bean burger was deelish! Wish I could remember what my DH had but he devoured it while I was on a horrible call outside so it must have been good."}
{"text":"It took a long time,  but I finally made it to a Primanti Brothers location. I will make this direct: everything I expected about the sandwiches was confirmed. They are big, gastro treats.

The rest? Meh.

Unfortunately service was less than I'd hoped for. The staff was disinterested at best. Food arrived at the table randomly. The restaurant wasn't clean. 

And then there are the wings. So disappointing. They are breaded as if they were from KFC. That's already a strike against. The sauce we tried was bland. Strike two. The breading turned then into greasy bombs. Strike three.

Conversely, the giant pickle was excellent.

Would I go back? Maybe to another location."}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh must visit because its also history!! The place is medium sized we had no problem getting seated on a late Saturday night. Old looking but service is incredibly friendly. They are known for putting french fries in their sandwiches and sauerkraut. Not a fan of sauerkraut but I would say its very unique tasting and gives a nice kick to the sandwich. We got the reuben, pastrami, kielbasa and pittburger. All great options! Don't forget to add the extra cheese, onions and egg. 

But by far my favorite was the chili. It is truly.... amazing... hands off the best chili I ever bad. I will be back and I will definitely bring friends!!"}
{"text":"plastic forks and knives, plastic plates, and paper coca-cola cups.  
bad food, not like original shop in the strip at all.
Food had no real taste at all, felt like can food warmed up.  Nothing original. 
Fries and cold \"slop\" in a sandwich is no big deal when its nasty.  
Dirty tables.

servers were polite and attentive, that's your one star.  

i asked for sparkling water, they had no idea what i was talking about.

If your not a drunk redneck, stay away."}
{"text":"This is a great spot with an amazing happy hour!  And their late night menu is such a deal. Check out the personal pizza for 4.00 after 9pm!  Hopefully you'll be lucky enough to have Jerry as your bartender. He'll take care of you and make you feel like a regular. Definitely a Pittsburgh tradition!"}
{"text":"Overhyped For Sure!!  One tomato & a slim slice of meat?  I've tried twice, & I'm done!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Good atmosphere. I like this one better than Cranberry. They removed pirogies from the menu which was a huge bummer. They accommodated our large party tonight of 20 adults and 12,kids. They did a great job. Food was hot and good."}
{"text":"Pitts-burger is a frozen beef patty with fries and coleslaw.  I originally asked for the burger well done.  I was told they can't do that since the patties are ready made and just heated up.  That should have been hint enough for me to change my choice. 

It has a weird old meat taste and the texture doesn't even resemble burger meat. I ate two bites, took out the meat and ate the bread and coleslaw. Unsure of how the menu claims its the #2 seller. Service was friendly but skip the burger and opt for a regular sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the Pittsburgh original Primanti Brothers. I absolutely love this place. If a sandwich piled with fries and coleslaw sounds appealing, visit this location. I recommend getting an egg on it and washing it down with a beer. I will continually visit this location for as long as I live anywhere near Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I like to stop in here after I get off of work. Though getting in and out from the busy road when you are turning left both times is a bit of a pain at times.

I check for any specials to see if something new is interesting. Sometimes they do have something neat to try and then I get it until they stop carrying it. My favorite thing to do though is to get a regular lamb gyro. But instead of getting it on pita bread I have it put on regular Italian bread like the rest of their sandwiches. It tastes SOOO much better this way.

The greeters are always really nice. The servers are usually really good too. Casey is a doll and real sweet. A few others do great jobs too. One, really, really tries, and is really nice. I have a couple of problems with one order one day and have heard a couple of complaints about them. But they normally make things right when it is all said and done. But I did hear one customer who was really upset about it and talked to the manager to get their meal for free. I understand their complaint but think they made FAR more of it than it needed to be and they should NOT have asked for the manager to cover their meal. It just was NOT that bad at all.

Some days I catch them at the right time and my food comes out really quickly and is always quite tasty. Other times the wait seems to be about average for the staff and customers there at the time."}
{"text":"I normally stop in this location when out with my mom and sisters. It is easier to get in and out of than the one in Mt. Lebanon for us. But everything about this location just seems average.

It seems like we have more issues with the order or waiting for food here. The quality seems the same as other locations. But there just seems to be more concern here. It may be possible that it could be because my one sister complains more and I go to the other location by myself. But maybe not. I've definitely noticed the issues myself

I was excited to stop in once as they had been running a special I was REALLY ENJOYING. However as it turns out this location wasn't doing that same special as the Mt. Lebanon one was. Here I thought the specials would have been company wide as with any other normal company. but I guess they figured they could just do whatever they wanted regardless. Oh well.

So with the extra issues and not having the same specials this location gets a 3 rather than a 4 that the other one got."}
{"text":"Another LONG day at work , the overtime is killin me. I need my Primanti fix , and decided to call them on the way home. (PS NEVER use directory assistance ! What a STUPID system !)

After almost driving the Ford into a telephone pole , I got the phone number to this Primantis.

I got a take out order of the WORLD FAMOUS Cheese steak and a big ole bowl of chili.

The staff here is tuned better than a Swiss watch ! timing was impeccable. great price , fast & courteous.

After getting home , I enjoyed my meal . I just wish they had a spicier chili, I used half a bottle of Tabasco sauce , and no crackers..

I still recommend the take out ! Great Job Guys !"}
{"text":"Best drunk/hangover food around. I get the double egg and cheese and add lots of hot sauce. Don't even think about trying to get anything on the side. It's all-or-nothing."}
{"text":"Great sandwich! Great Fries! Rude ass service this 50 something housewives waitress need some classes on manners and etiquette LOL"}
{"text":"Normally, I would give them 4 stars, but the last time I went there, they changed their pizzas by putting in more garlic. It just doesn't taste right."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this sandwich place, my boyfriend and I were in town and were told by everyone that we had to eat here, but after reading some reviews I was nervous about the greasiness content. However, our sandwiches were delicious. Thick bread that wasn't greasy at all, yummy French fries and coleslaw in the sandwich. My only complaint was the service, I had to go up to the bar to get my water refilled because the waitress just disappeared on us, otherwise, it was an enjoyable sandwich."}
{"text":"Wtf one bartender during happy hour. Drinks slow in coming both at the bar and in dining area.  Food was slow in coming as well.  Had to ask about the happy hour specials; not advertised anywhere which is a shame since the alcohol specials are pretty good.  Pizza slices which are part of the happy hour not even on the menu.

Place was mostly dead during the happy hour, but picked up soon after."}
{"text":"Iconic restaurant in the burgh but I'm just a mayo based coleslaw kind of girl that would take the sandwich to the level it needs to be but the fries are bomb"}
{"text":"After I did some research online (prior to visiting Pittsburgh for an interview), I decided to give this place a try.  

The ambiance was great, and the combination they put together a sandwich (fries, coleslaw, and cheesesteak) was interesting.  When I got the bill, wow...very good price.

I would def try again if I get to go to pitt again."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh it seems french fries are treated more like a condiment than a side. I'm not much of a sandwich fan but  Primanti's really does serve up a huge and filling sandwich for a decent price."}
{"text":"The food is great Pittsburgh food.  The atmosphere typical sports bar, so that's cool.  The bartender Jessica needs to go, she was absolutely the rudest bartender in town.  She rolled her eyes because I changed my mind.   If she is ever at he bar again when I come in I'll leave."}
{"text":"It is what it is. I am not from the Eastcoast or Pittsburgh, but I know it is an icon. I just don't really like the dressing on the coleslaw, or the soggy French fries on the sammich, or that the white bread that is supposed to hold the fat sammich together, always falls apart. I do enjoy the atmosphere especially when a local game is on and everyone is enjoying their beer."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on the way back home today.  The food was great - we really enjoyed their sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  Extremely taste - loved the vinegar coleslaw without the mayo.

Our serve, Jonathan was great and very responsive to our requests!

We also had them pack up a deconstructed sandwich to bring home to a displaced Pittsburghite who had suggested that we visit...  Hopefully this will bring back memories of home for him!"}
{"text":"Glad we went as everyone says YOU MUST.  My husband and I went at night on a Saturday.  It was the weekend before Christmas so if normally crowded with college kids, it was not.  There were a few tables and the bar wide open.  One of the best ruebens I have had.  Nice beer selection and very friendly and attentive bartenders.  I noticed MANY people come in for take out!  We'll go back as we stay yearly nearby at the Wyndym."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches. Each sandwich is large and is a meal by itself. This was our first trip and we enjoyed the experience. We plan on visiting Primanti each time we visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here 1:30pm on a Thursday, past the busy time. The place was half filled. The staff is pleasant and quick. Super casual atmosphere. You can see cooks preparing your food behind a glass counter, like at a Subway.
 
Prepare to eat with your hands and get really dirty. The sandwiches are served on a tissue, not a plate, so you can wrap up any remainders to toss out easily. Big, greasy, juicy hot sandwiches.
 
Got the jumbo baloney ($6.59) and steak ($8.39) sandwiches. Definitely go for the steak sandwich. Every sandwich is made with thick slices of white bread, so prepare for a carb overload. Each sandwich is tall because it is stuffed with cole slaw and french fries, which become soggy quickly. The cole slaw is full of flavor, tangy, tasty. The steak, melted with cheese was tasty. Wish there was more of it, as 80% of the sandwich consisted of bread, fries, and slaw.
 
Not the best sandwich I've ever had, but a filling bite for when you're craving something unhealthy."}
{"text":"Everyone said this was the local experience. Traveling alone, I ordered to go. It's only 2 blocks from my hotel room. Opened the bag in my room to find the side of fries were missing!!  and I guess the black bean burger doesn't come with fries on it like the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"\"We used to go here all the time when we were drunk.\" Turns out it isn't so great sober. Sorry. After being talked up by my companions I got really excited for this place but I was sadly let down. My angus steak sandwich had dry meat and seemingly no taste. I'll give them an extra star for cheap drinks but takeaway another star as our waitress seemed to think she didn't need to do her job...and essentially told us that. No offense but this place isn't good enough for me to put up with waiters who are mad at the world and/or their life...go find a deli with awesome an awesome Reuben and then we can talk. What made that even worse is that we started at the bar with a witty bartender who was really great at his job. Whomp. Whomp. 

Soooo...yeah skip. Their time is past...unless you are drunk..."}
{"text":"Felt a little jipped on my corned beef sandwich :( Service at this location was good. TVs everywhere with some type of sport playing. We got to sit in the outdoor patio which also had 2 TV's, couldn't get my toddler from watching it - so it can be a distraction, but I suppose it's good if you want to watch any major sports. This times experience at Primati's wasn't so wow as the first. Learned that Primanti is becoming a chain... which kind of doesn't make Primanti's as special. I liked my first time visiting Pittsburgh and getting their savory sandwich (with fries within the sandwich!) at the Strip."}
{"text":"When I lived in Philly, I would occasionally make a 2 am run to Pat's Steaks for a cheesesteak.  Was it the best cheesesteak in Philly? Not even close.  But it was something that you just did.  I'd group Primanti Brothers into the same category.

I'll ignore the sticky surfaces on the table & railing and focus my comments on the food.  My family ordered three sandwiches - pastrami, ham and hot sausage - along with the Smallman St. fries.  The food was delivered fairly quickly and we dug in.  After a few bites, we all came to the same conclusion:  the food was just OK.  My sandwich didn't have any type of flavor to elicit a reaction from my taste buds.  And even with all of the toppings, the fries weren't anything to get excited about.  We actually left the fries unfinished and chose not to take the remnants with us.

The food wasn't bad and the price was certainly reasonable.  But there wasn't anything there that would make me look forward to another visit in the near future.  Been there, done that.  Do something different on the next trip."}
{"text":"I am a Pittsburgher and love the original Primantis. It is a Pittsburgh staple and serves great food. Personally, I like the roast beef and the fish sandwiches. High quality consistent ingredients make for a yummy sandwich!"}
{"text":"During my time in Pittsburgh, I couldn't go without stopping by Primanti Bros. to see what all the hype was about. At least at this location, it seems like more of a sports bar than sandwich joint, which makes sense considering beer is the \"#1 best seller\". They had plenty of drink options and some interesting concoctions that sounded tasty. But I came here for the \"Almost Famous\" sandwiches.

I went with the Pitts-Burger & Cheese, considering it's the \"#2 best seller\". I really wanted to love this sandwich and I was so excited to try it. It definitely looked like a monster. But after I took a few bites I was really disappointed. I'm not a coleslaw fan, but I just could not get past this stuff. The bitter taste dominated the sandwich. I tried a few bites without the slaw but was still unimpressed. The meat had very little flavor, the fries just added starchiness, and the cheese was unnoticeable.

Despite great service and a fun and welcoming environment, I was disappointed in Primanti Bros. I definitely respect their uniqueness and don't knock anyone for raving about the sandwiches; it's just not for me."}
{"text":"I understand that some places get better reviews just because they were on some TV show. I get it. But this is seriously incredible that this place gets so much attention for what they serve. The atmosphere is great - but this is about food...which was seriously awful. I'm not a picky eater in any sense so it's rare I just flat out don't like something. 

I got their signature \"Pittsburger Cheesesteak\" and fried mushrooms. It looked amazing and I already had the mindset that I'd love it, but it was seriously up there in some of the worst meals ever. The burger (not sliced meat) was EXACTLY like the meat that comes in those Smart Ones frozen salisbury steak dinners. I've eaten those a lot so I know...but I never had high hopes for a $1.50 frozen entree. I ate most of it because I hadn't eaten all day, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It wasn't too greasy, it wasn't under/over cooked and it wasn't just short of some seasoning. It was just cheap meat thrown into a stacked sandwich in hopes it would just blend in and not get noticed. 

Cleveland has Panini's which is much like this place but way better and fresher food. It would be one thing if I didn't enjoy the combo of everything on it and I always take into account if the place was having one of those off nights - but it wasn't poorly prepared/cooked, it was just bad quality."}
{"text":"This place was tiny for such a downtown, central location. We went with the family after seeing the christmas decorations downtown.

Yummo I do love me some Primantis! Though I can really only justify partaking one or two (at the most!) times a year. Seriously it is SO freakin greasy and huge. what can be better then a hot sammy loaded with meat of your choice (or egg or cheese if that's your deal) topped with tangy slaw and salty crunchy fries?! If you are feeling like indulging even more, order the colossal fish sandwich. it is HUGE, like shocking! 

Their beer menus are totally standard types. They're cold and frothy and wash down the salt and grease perfectly."}
{"text":"Tried and true. It's all about the slaw. I always see the same workers and they're always on it. Good shop for a casual bite."}
{"text":"OK so coming from New Orleans I'm very critical of my food. So I was taken to lunch by upper management to a food place specific to Pittsburgh. This food place was this restaurant. The waitstaff was nice. I ordered the hot sausage sandwich since I miss New Orleans thinking I was going to get a mini slice of goodness like Pattons, but I was wrong. The bread was cold and it was waaaaaay too much cold slaw and French fries. The hot sausage was not even mild it had a pickled taste.  I think if it was separate it would be been better however that's not how it was meant to be."}
{"text":"Admitted: I was a tourist. In town visiting friends who are locals. This place was a great taste (punny) of Pittsburgh. Sure you should go in for a bypass immediately after eating here, but it's worth it. 

Sit at the counter. Order more food than you can probably eat and don't feel bad about it. Get cheese on your fries. 

Don't wear clothes that you care too terribly much about because there will be grease everywhere."}

This is my take on his comment on Primanti Brothers, \"Being born and raised in NYC makes you a fan of two things until you die, (1) the Giants, and (2) Primanti Brothers(once you've tried it).

The sandwich is ok. Now I know what is like to eat everything that normally gets mixed inside of my stomach. Not bad, not fantastic, just ok. 

On the side note, ...wow Pittsburg is full of Drowzees (Pokemon go).  Is it because there are so many bars???? Caught few sitting here eating..."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros. is a traditional Pittsburgh meal.  It consists of a sandwich that is stacked high with fries and coleslaw, and its pretty cheap as well.  If your in pittsburgh, or your looking for a cheap place to eat, then you should check it out.  The taste is very unique, and I love the huge sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just no flavor what so ever on these sandwiches. Tried the pastrami and the Cajun chicken.. Zzzzzz ... Boring. Got my hopes up for nothing... This is what they call a tourist trap"}
{"text":"I had a cheeseburger and it was decent. I'm not a fan of coleslaw which made the burger a little dry after taking it off. I'll have to give something else a try the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I was on a road trip back east from Ohio and was told there was no way that I could pass through PGH without stopping at Primanti Brothers. Through the best of fortunes, my friend whom I was meeting for lunch works very close to the Market Square location, so we decided to meet there.

I was not disappointed...not in the least! Actually, I was surprised at how moist and delicious a sandwich laden down (in the best possible way) with cheese, cold cuts, cole slaw and french fries could be. And the service was great, too - I was worried that not being a local/regular might work against me, but our server was very friendly and helped to make this a great lunch experience. Since I was continuing on my eastward trek, I passed on the Yuengling's and opted for a ginger ale. (I THINK it was a Vernor's...it better had been!) 

My only wish for Primanti's is that they had more vegetarian options (I know, I know...when in Rome, but my friend is a vegetarian and didn't have much to choose from on the menu). Also, trying to park in Market Square was, for want of a better word...trying. Not the restaurant's problem to solve, but I could imagine that those coming in who aren't on foot would like an easier way to leave their cars behind. Primanti Brothers is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Came here our first time ever in Pittsburgh! Was not disappointed, it's definitely a must when visiting the city. We got the Pittsburgher and I got the kelbasa one. They were HUGE and sooooo good! They also serve beer in large glasses which was nice. The food came out in no time."}
{"text":"Definitely didn't live up to the expectations.  Being from the east coast I've had my fair share of delicious sandwiches.  Stopped in for lunch and had the capicola sandwich.  Outside of the bread I can't say it was memorable in any way.

That said I could see this as a post night out stop and would probably enjoy it a lot more."}
{"text":"Holy overrated sandwich batman. I had the #2 best seller, and I almost asked for a refund. Fries were no where near crisp, slaw was bland, and the steak was just a poor cut of meat. The bread was definitely fresh, but it was the most flavorful component, and that was not what it was supposed to be. 

I likely will not return, because I have checked this one off my list... all I can think is that it got all the press on the Food channel by buying its way on."}
{"text":"When visiting back home, this is my go to place. I always get the Pitts-Burger, which is a burger patty, topped with coke slaw, tomatoes, and of course the most delicious fries. This is a Pittsburgh delicacy and I love going home for it. My parents love this location because there is a lot of parking and seats within the restaurant too. They always rave about how the staff is accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"So Delicious! 
Definitely worth the price and wait. I would maybe try to get in a little earlier as the line can be a little long. 
I got the Pittsburgh + Cheese and it was enough to fill me up without eating an appetizer or sides."}
{"text":"This was so gross. I remember it being much better in the past but this sandwich was terrible. I'm a pittsburgh local, and this was aweful. But I can check it off my list and never eat there again."}
{"text":"What can I say, Primanti Brothers is Pittsburgh. Ordered a Corned Beef & Cheese and decided to include a fried egg this time. I have been eating Primanti's since I was a kid, and I'm never disappointed with the food.  This location (like most) is a crowded place with somewhat slow service (but I expected this before walking in)  The joint was clean and have a good vibe.  I highly recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Arrived on busy Saturday needing a  table for 8. 20 min wait seemed about right.  Helpful staff. Great portions. Good place for hungry family.  Pizza, wings, chili, pastrami all solid in my book. Lots of TV's!! 
Bonus."}
{"text":"Great vibe and great food! If your in the Pittsburgh area you have to stop in and get a sandwich."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this location is legit and they have tv's everywhere. The reason for the low rating is because they don't cut your sandwich for you at this location and that just grinds my gears. I think it's annoying that the new owners tried changing a good thing. Don't just arrogantly put a knife in my sandwich and ask me to cut it myself! Get a grip primantis!"}
{"text":"Alright, I heard about this chain on Man v. Food and we just had to try it out. And honestly, we were quite disappointed. The sandwich is tasteless unless you douse it with condiments or get a particularly flavorful filling. I got the cheese one and my boyfriend got the colossal fish (both vegetarians--its not so friendly for us...fail). Neither sandwich was impressive--in size or taste. I'm a 5\"4' and 120lb girl and I finished mine no problem. Just incredibly bland. The bread tasted like cheap white bread, the fries were just incredibly greasy, the cole slaw was hardly cole slaw and more like wet cabbage. The cheese on mine was basically tasteless and my boyfriends fish was definitely from a box of something frozen. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Saw this place featured on the travel channel and was looking forwarded to trying it.  Got here and the place had limited customers and were not busy, service was poor and they were out of a variety of items.  I had the pastrami &cheese sandwich and it was good, but overall this place is overrated, very disappointed, considering the reviews from the travel channel.....Never coming back"}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for the weekend recently, and wanted to try this \"staple\" of pittsburgh.  We arrived at around 8:30ish and the four of us sat at a high top table.  We were the only table in the place and the bartender made it quite clear that she didn't feel like coming around from behind the bar to wait on us. The bar was almost full of people drinking and not eating, and overall the place felt a lot more like a bar than it did a restaurant.  They had quite a few options on draught and I'm sure sitting at the bar would even make for a fun night.

We got two pittsburgers, a steak and cheese and a reuben.  It took a very long time for us to get our food considering we were the only table in the restaurant, and when it came out it was cold and had very clearly been sitting back in the kitchen for a long time before anyone brought it out.   My pittsburger was like a cold sausage patty--not a burger and had no taste.  The cole slaw actually tasted like chemicals.  I figured i could at least eat the french fries out of the sandwich, but they were cold and soggy.  I ended up eating only the bread from my sandwich and my boyfriend's pickle slices both of which were actually delicious. After we finished eating our sandwiches (or not eating at all in my case) we waited and waited for our check which never came, so long that i called in a pizza to our air bnb.  Finally we had to go up to the bar to actually cash out.

I waited a while to write this review because i was pretty fired up after this meal/experience, and I really don't like leaving poor reviews for restaurants unless they are totally warranted, but this was just a very bad experience.  I definitely would recommend going elsewhere in southside."}
{"text":"I can understand why I was told this is the first place I need to go when I visited Pittsburgh. It was a unique and delicious meal! There was a line out the door, but it moved fairly quickly. We had to wait only 10-15 minutes. We did not realize the line was only to get in the door. It seemed like it was self seating though. You could also just walk up to the cash register and order to go, I suppose, if you didn't want to wait. It is pretty tiny inside, but they have TV's with sports on. The noise was average. The staff was super friendly and despite how busy it was, they were very attentive. We sat at the bar and really enjoyed our meal! The staff was good at suggesting what was the most popular and their favorite. We tried the pastrami sandwich and it comes on Italian bread with coleslaw and french fries in it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It is an experience worth having! I will definitely be getting another Primanti Brothers' sandwich next time I am in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Went with the Pitts-burger, and enjoyed it.  I agree with alot of my fellow Yelpers that throwing a bunch of odd toppings (French fires and Mayo-less Slaw) does not make a sandwich great, but for the 6 bucks that it was life will go on.  I am also a realist that remembers for each person that told me that I NEED to check this place out, a story of drunken shenanigans was close by, and the sandwich had the all of the right elements of a great drunken meal.  If I find myself in Pitt again, I will be sure to re-try Primantis under the influence."}
{"text":"I'm in town on business, so of course I had to try this place. I had the chicken gyro and a slice, which was still cheaper than what is pay for just a gyro back home in Cali. The food arrived fast, and it was pretty good. 

The cucumber sauce is spot on, but the meat and veggies were a little thick cut and unseasoned compared to traditional gyros. The pizza was great however - I preferred the more tangy sauce compared to the sweeter stuff you get on the west coast. Atmosphere and service were great as well."}
{"text":"We've been here many times since this location opened.    It's one of those things that you don't review unless it's one extreme or another.

Tonight was the final bad experience.   We were seated and waited 15 minutes before our waitress came by.      A food runner tried to give us another order and I told him we've never seen a waitress.    Mysteriously she finally shows up to take our drink order.     8 minutes later I finally had a beer in my hand and shortly after we ordered.

We ordered a pizza, couple salads and a smallman St fry.       The salads we're okay, but pizza and fries were completely inedible.    Fries were cold, and a blob of grease (more than normal).   The pizza dough was half cooked, paper flat, and wet.       

Took close to another 15 minutes to find our waitress to complain too.    The \"manager\" stopped by and told us he'd take them off the check.      I told him this wasn't our first bad experience.    I expected the salads to get comped too.    Nope.  Still left with a $40 check that half of our party didn't eat.

I explained my upset to our waitress.  To which she replied, yeah we get busy and things go down hill.      But it wasn't busy.  There was no wait for a table.

Guess when I'm craving Primantis, we'll have to sick to the Crafton location.     The crew of this Moon location cost themselves a long time customer in us."}
{"text":"Truly the most divine sandwich in the world. Primantis holds a special place in my heart, and was the first place I needed to go once back in Pgh. Cole slaw and fries ON TOP of a heap of meat. Perfect."}
{"text":"Had the Colossal Fish Sandwich flavors were great well worth the time to come here I know it's not the original but if it's better -- wow"}
{"text":"The sandwich was pretty tasty and filling. It's definitely worth a late night stop if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Really huge sandwiches with slaw and fried smooshed on. I had the pastrami and the hubby had the cheese steak, which is a patty not anything like a Philly cheese steak. I didn't care for his but the pastrami was really good. The fries needed some seasoning but the slaw and the bread were on the money. 

The place itself is pretty dirty but it was cool to sit at the bar and watch them cook the sandwiches. 

A classic..."}
{"text":"Ugh! I LOVE this place. These sandwiches are the best, the place is always packed, and it really is one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh. Truly an experience that shouldn't be missed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on our most recent trip to Pittsburgh. Neither of us had had dined at this Pittsburgh institution before, and we both wanted to try it after being told by our Pittsburgh friends that we had to go here. We ate here on a beautiful Sunday at noon when the Pirates and Penguins were playing, so it seemed busier than normal and we had to wait to be seated. No worries, we were seated fairly quickly inside. The restaurant itself was styled like mid-1900s diner and was really pretty cool. Service was quick and before I knew it I had a Pittsburgher sandwich - the quintessential Primanti Bros meal. It was a sizable sandwich stacked with Pittsburgh cheesesteak, coleslaw, fries, and tomatoes. The coleslaw was tangy but not creamy (a plus in my book), the fries were crispy, and the meat was tender. The meat and bread both left me wanting more. The Italian bread was thick...and that's about all I can say for it. Wholly generic otherwise. The meat also lacked any distinguishing flavor other than \"meaty.\" I really could have used some more seasoning and flavor from the two biggest components of the sandwich. I'm glad we made it out to Primanti Bros, but I'm not sure I'd rush back, especially since Pittsburgh has so much else to offer. Chances are good that if you're visiting from out of town, you'll wind up here. You should try it once, then move on to better local establishments."}
{"text":"Ok,

 I have friends that have raved about this joint for years.  So, it was time to put it to the test.  For starters, there was a Pens game starting up, so the place was packed. We stood for about 15 minutes, then got seated. Not too shabby.  The place is small and cramped but not too bad.

A friend recommended I order the Steak & Cheese w/ an egg, so I did.  My wife ordered the fish, and my daughter got the ham and cheese.

The server brought out a side of fries, which were lacking salt... Okay, no biggy, throw some ketchup in the mix and you're good to go.

and for the sammys...

Now, I get the whole, \"I'm from Pittsburgh, I grew up on this stuff and it's best thing since indoor plumbing.\"  But seriously folks... THIS is what everyone raves about?  I mean, let's break the sandwich down.

Two slices of bread and in between, coleslaw, french fries, steak and cheese, and a fried egg.  Grant it, the combination is exquisite, however.  THERE IS NO SEASONING ON ANYTHING.  The strongest flavor in every bite was cabbage.  I wish I was kidding, but it was so bland that I had to drown it in hot sauce to at least get some kind of flavor to it.

My wife's fish sammy was just the same. We probably could have swapped and couldn't have told the difference.

We were both thoroughly disappointed and couldn't even finish it.  Actually, my daughter's ham and cheese was the most flavorful of the 3 items ordered. 

In all, it was something that had to be tried. But to say this is a great sandwich, is a lie I can't pass along."}
{"text":"I went here because Thrillist said I had to have it while in Pittsburgh.

I got the colossal fish sandwich, fried pickles, and smallman fries (i think thats what they were called).

The pickles tasted good (briny and slighlty spicy), but the texture was off. The spears were not crunchy at all, so a bite just pulls the entire spear out of the batter.

Smallman fries were a bargain. Theyre chili cheese fries with bacon and fresh jalepenos. You get enough to hate yourself for less than 6 bucks. This can easily be shared. However, i found that the whole thing gets overwhelmed by the amount of chili, and the chili is a bit on the sweeter side so thats not how i want my fries to taste.

Now the sandwich. I guess the sandwiches are tomatoes, fries, cheese, and cole slaw plus a meat source between two thick slices of italian bread.

The bread is pretty good. It's soft, somewhat dense white bread with a hearty but not hard crust. The fries taste like handcut fries. Theyre soft and brown with little to no salt. The cole slaw is the kind i like: no mayonnaise. It tastes like the mayonnaisy kind of cole slaw without the mayo itself. The fish is sliced kind of thin (but its still a big piece of fish) and its in a crispy batter.

My overall impression of the sandwich was dry and kind of bland. The sandwich doesnt have any sauce in it; the only good source of moisture is the tomato and cole slaw. If the cole slwa wasnt a third of the sandwich's volume, it would be too dry. I couldnt taste the cheese at all; i wouldnt be surprised if they simply forgot to add any. There werent any elements of the sandwich with a dominant flavor, and the ketchup and hot sauce at the table make the sandwich taste worst.

Despite the food not being good (in my opinion), i had a fun time. Its a great place to go with a group and watch a game on tv, and it has a Hooters-like atmosphere minus the degradation of women.

With the great atmosphere but mediocre food, i found this place to be very average. However, the internet makes this place sound like an important place to try in Pittsburgh. Give it a shot of youre in town and looking for something casual and not too adventurous."}
{"text":"FRIES + MEAT + SLAW + ITALIAN BREAD = AWESOME.

We went twice for lunch while we were in the 'burgh- it was so good we had to go back the second day we were in town. The first day we were there we sat outside and were bracing ourselves as we looked at the menu preparing to fork over close to $10 for each sammy...but guess what?! They were about $6 each- fries and awesomeness included. 

This location offers a spacious dining area including a full bar and a ton of TVs- I'm sure it would be a superior spot to watch the Stillers. 

Yay, sammys!"}
{"text":"Bulky Sandwiches, piled high with toppings - solid!!!"}
{"text":"My partner wanted to try a Pittsburgh cheesesteak sandwich and we read this was the best place to go. I don't like fries and I don't eat cheese, but I still loved my sandwich! I ordered the chicken sans cheese and fries, of course. The cole slaw was very good; I loved that it didn't have mayo in it and the flavor was great. Our waitress recommended that we try their hot sauce on the sandwiches and so glad we did because it really spiced it up and made the sandwich even better. My partner ordered the real deal and said it was delicious as well! We also ordered a \"small\" beer, which is a full 12 oz glass, pretty sweet deal. 

Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Not the place to go if u are looking for a good burger. The place is great for people watching and has a lot of ambiance but the sandwiches were mediocre and lacked flavor. I tried both the chicken and the Pittsburgh burger and liked neither and I was starved after my plane ride.  In addition I had their  $6 dollar salad ....next time I'm grabbing a bag of salad from the dollar store-  it was pitiful!"}
{"text":"Honestly its nothing special at all.  Put fries on a sandwich?  Cool idea.  Not at all actually especially when the fries aren't cooked.  The quality of the meats is nothing special and yes the bread is fresh and soft but who cares when your sandwich tastes like chalk and is so soggy that you start to hate the city even more.  People talk about this place like it is so amazing but seriously there is so much more to Pittsburgh than this dinky sandwich place."}
{"text":"Three words: nom nom nom! ...What more can you say about a place that puts french fries and coleslaw INSIDE your kielbasa sandwich ... and a place that you are usually eating at (read: scarfing down entire bites whole at) around 2 AM on weekend nights.  I'll note though that I've eaten here sober and loved it just as much. The first time I had Primanti's I didn't understand the whole fries-in-your-sandwich hype.... more carbs inbetween bread slices? But I've honestly realized after eating there multiple times that ... well, two things: 1) it's delicious with the coleslaw & ketchup, and 2) I'm a total shameless fat-kid (at heart, thankfully not in real life.. although if I continue to love Primanti's as much as I do now, it could be in real life soon as well)."}
{"text":"A local tradition!  People talk about the Primanti Sandwich in Pittsburgh. We has to give it a try. At first you wonder if it is a good idea to stack french fries and coleslaw inside your sandwich. You have to try it to believe, it does taste good! We shared a Primanti Salad (I know!) and Primati Fish Sandwich. Both are not the original items on the menu, but definitely uniquely Primanti specials!

{"text":"This place is a dive of course but it's iconic. You have to stop by at least once. Especially on a Sunday during football season where you will get lost in the sea of black and gold! Everything I've ordered has been delicious. And you HAVE to get the slaw and fries on the sandwich - if you ask for them on the side then there's really no point of coming. Try the pastrami or turkey sandwiches. Those are probably my favorite. And if you're feeling extra naughty, go for the smallman street fries. And don't regret a minute of it!"}
{"text":"Their sandwich was just something that we would only try once.  I love corned beef and I like cold slaw.  I can even see them together but to add french fries on inside of  this sandwich just made it a soggy mess.  It was just greasy and oily.  The French fries were not hot and crunchy like McDs it was just a soggy oily mess.  It was something I would only try once because of the novelty but I would not try again.  Too oily for my taste."}
{"text":"I like a Primantis sandwich. I love the kielbasa and cheese. When I come to PBs, its been a few weeks since I had one, I almost always get the kielbasa and cheese (with an egg). Their pizzas rock as well and Sundays they have 51 cent wings. Great specials during Pens and Bucs games too. Oh, they have Yeungling Black and Tan on draft. Boom (mike drop)"}
{"text":"It's the only \"Pittsburgh thing\" I really knew about beforehand and it didn't disappoint.

Seems to me a lot of the negative reviews are from people who built this up too much. Yes, it's famous, but ultimately it's a just a lunch meat sandwich with fries on it. Enjoy it for what it is.

I went with pastrami and it was solid. Definitely left full and hey, now I can say I've been here. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"I know I'm known as a Primanti's hater, but if the one in The Strip was like this Mt. Lebo location, I'd have given it a better review. 

We took friends from Virginia here last weekend, and they loved it and can't wait to come back! I tried a sandwich with fried fish on it, and it was actually pretty good! This time the fries were crispy, and the slaw was a little sweet as well as tangy. 

The insides of this one are really cool and resemble a hunting lodge. It's clean (especially the restrooms) and spacious also, very much unlike the Strip District version. 

Our server was polite (also unlike the one in the Strip) and was very patient with my friend who has lupus and comes to Pittsburgh for treatment (her illness makes her lethargic and her brain foggy at times). 

In addition to the sandwich, I liked the pecan pie which came with awesome whipped cream (it wasn't from a can), vanilla ice cream, and was served in a large portion. They even have really good dill pickles. You get a whole one cut into fours per order! 

Give me this family-oriented version of Primanti Brothers anyday."}
{"text":"My little experience here has been bothering me so I have decided to put in my two cents. 

First of all, the place was filthy. I understand that they may have been busy, but I almost expected a rat to scurry across the floor at any given moment. I don't think I saw anyone run a washcloth over the counters or tables the entire time I was in this hole. 

Second, the service was God awful! There were 2 people serving/cooking. The guy came up to my companion and I, asked what we wanted to order, then before I had half a second to open my mouth and utter a sound the \"server\" walled away and served someone else. He did this no less than twice. I would have walked right out if this hadn't been the only place open to get a bit to eat within a reasonable walking distance from a concert venue I was attempting to visit. There was a woman making the food, and she didn't change her latex gloves between handling raw meat and cooked meat or rinse her hands when she handled meat to grabbing the coleslaw by hand. She seemed to know which orders were which, but the guy was having trouble keeping them straight. Maybe he could have TRIED to write them down. 

And lastly, the food. I had ordered the roast beef and an extra side of loaded fries. The bread was hard, not toasted hard, stale hard. The beef was just OK, but not bad. But the fries, the staple of a Primanti sandwich, were disgusting! The oil that they had been fried in tasted like it hadn't been changed in over a year, which I am sure is not the case...I hope..."}
{"text":"I'm sorry guys, really, I understand every place has to have something they can boast and call their own, but with all of the hype, I was beyond greatly disappointed in the food. Soggy as a rain drenched rat and as tasteless as one of the Kardashians. I am all for a good corned beef sandwich, when I find one, but not here. Seriously, save you time and energy fighting with a crowd and go to Sammy's instead. At least you can taste the meat on their sandwiches. The single star isn't to be spiteful, but for the shattered expectations."}
{"text":"Had to come get some primanti bros when in Pittsburgh! We came right around lunch time and was seated immediately. Our server was attentive and had mentioned that one of her favorites was the capicola. 

I decided to go for her recommendation and I wasn't disappointed. One teeny tiny regret was that I didn't ask for double meat! The flavors were great. The Slaw was really delicious and not what you would be expecting. Normally it would be mayo but their slaw was more vinegar based. The hint of spiciness/kick from the capicola was a perfect combo with the zing from the slaw. 

If you're trying to find parking you might have to circle the block a few times or else bite the bullet and pay for garage parking!"}
{"text":"I've been to both locations and for some reason the food was hittin' here more than the downtown location.

Not sure if out other was just so piping hot and fresh off the stove or if it was baptized in grease, but my French fry and slaw adorned Pittsburgher made a bigger impression on me this time around than at the downtown location.

While in the moment, you'll be cradling your dear food with utter indulgence and delight, you may want to make sure you've got some Tums handy. Not only was I still full the next morning and afternoon, but my stomach had a little Riverdance concert taking place inside.

Whatever you do, bring cash and show the folks here respect and appreciation and they'll take care of you."}
{"text":"Seriously. Amazing. 

Marissa, you rock. Thank you so much for your amazing service! Our bacon and egg sandwich was off the charts and we are so grateful we made it in time to meet the last call. I will be talking about this greasy and amazing meal for life! Primanti Bros has been on my list for a long time as a tourist, and I'm so glad I got to experience it first hand. Thank you, thank you! 

Ps- for those who show up at 2:00 and expect to be served after last call.:: and then proceed to act rude about it... Consider that each and every person who works at primanti Bros works hard and deserves to go home. Don't be entitled and feel like you deserve to be served just because you're inside the restaurant. Show respect!"}
{"text":"First time trying Primanti Bros and it was fantastic!

Location is large with restaurant and pub side. 

Super friendly staff and menu has wide range of food and pricing is perfect. 

We tried HBK sandwich as any Penguins fan has to try it. 

Delicious and huge portions! Added side of cheese fries. 

Overall must try in Pittsburgh area and one of few 5 stars for me!!"}
{"text":"This place is busy... and it's a Thursday. Big bar, plenty of table seating and patio area.  Great selection of alcohol and a crazy menu variety. I thought I would have waited forever for my food with how busy it was. Well, I was wrong. It was literally done and in front of me in less than 6 minutes. And it was awesome. Great customer service and the food was delicious!  I will definitely be back to this place!  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. 

We ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. 

Then, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry\". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. 

We were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner. Either Primanti Brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide, or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient. We will definitely not be coming back the next time we are in town. Our money is better spent else where."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich!!  Fries on a sandwich?! I think YES!! First time to Pittsburgh and our \"tour guide\" said this was a must.  The New Yorker was delish!! Put this on your list!"}
{"text":"Best Primanti experience yet!  Fast and friendly service, delicious Pittsburgher which my 11 year old son totally crushed.  Our server was wonderful and very attentive, and the manager even came out for a personal chat to ensure everything was proper and to talk about the big Steeler game tomorrow.  You gotta come here when you are near the airport!  Last tip--tried the Cajun chicken for the first time--very tasty."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying that I have never been to Pittsburgh, therefore, I've never had the opportunity to eat at any of the Primanti Bros establishments.  Holy cow.  There's a reason this place is a Pittsburgh landmark.  

My party of four sat down right away in a corner surrounded by hand painted murals.  We immediately put in orders for Cheese Fries and Smallman Street Fries (w/ cheese, chili, bacon, jalapeños, and sour cream).  We all ordered the Pitts-Burger, which is their version of a cheesesteak, served on fluffy, white, Italian bread and stacked with Primanti fries, their famous coleslaw, onions, and tomatoes.  Though not as good as Philly Cheesesteaks, this almost comes close.  

The prices here are great (about 8 for a massive sandwich and 4 for a heap of Smallman Street Fries).  The murals around the restaurant add an awesome touch to the restaurant, and the place reeks of Pittsburgh culture (in a good way!).  This is a must visit for anyone strolling through the Strip District in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"PROS:
consistent food quality
inexpensive
Great bar area for \"watchin' the game\" with HUGE TV's all over!
Pool Table

CONS:

Not much more to say on this one.
I remain unimpressed but there are some personal food cravings that I experience from time to time.

My FAVES: 
Pizza
Pulled Pork Sandwich
Ranch Fries (Soooo simple, but soooo tasty)

This place is good for kids earier in the evening.  Pretty friendly atmosphere for dinner."}
{"text":"This spot just opened... More restaurant style than the others in Pittsburgh, bit the food is just as good. Fast service, friendly staff, and greasy sandwiches with fries and slaw on everything..."}
{"text":"Everyone says, \"you have to have a Pramanti Brothers sandwich\". Been there, done that, now time to move on. I understand it is a fun sandwich with fries and coleslaw included. But it still lacked that thing you like in sandwiches... flavor. It wasn't extremely tasteful and the staff wasn't extremely helpful or friendly. The place was located in a nice area and had a nice steel town vibe to it. But the food was just average. I was expecting a signature sandwich to taste better.. like a New Orleans muffellata."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you'll either like it or not. But since it's one of Pittsburgh's famous food attractions, it's an experience a person should try at least once.

FIrst time I ordered the cheesesteak (minus the cheese) with an extra egg on top. Never had fries in a sandwich before and I liked that the coleslaw had no mayo. Fried eggs always makes sandwiches 10x better.

Second time I ordered the pastrami. Didn't enjoy it as much as the cheesesteak. For some reason, I couldn't stomach the fries and coleslaw this time around. The coleslaw started having a weird taste after a few bites and the fries were just weird and soggy. Mixed together with the squishy pastrami, definitely wasn't as good of an experience as my first time here.

Still, definitely come here, especially if you're hungry and need an outrageously large sandwich for a cheap price. It's like two meals in one."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh institution... and if you don't believe me, wait five minutes and they'll be sure and tell you themselves.  ;-)

Everyone in Pittsburgh knows what this is all about. . . it's cheap, good, filling, hot sandwiches with fries and cole-slaw on top.  For bar food, it is excellent!  If you're expecting it to be food-snob stuff, this place isn't for you.

They know what works and they stick to it.  The food, as I said, is of a better quality than you'd think.  They keep prices pretty low for everything.  They understand they're a bar and don't pretend to be something different.  I appreciate that.  Plenty of sports on TV.  Surprisingly clean and a fun atmosphere.  

Service isn't bad and isn't great.  Although I will say that they usually get your order right, keep your drink full, and give you what you ordered.

If you're visiting Pittsburgh, you have to stop in and see what it's all about.  If you live in Pittsburgh, you should stop in next time you want fast food.  This stuff is better and probably cheaper too.

Love it.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was told it was a Pittsburgh staple so I had tok give it a try. Great service however it's a sandwich of your choice of meats with fries and vinegar slaw on it.. Great experience thought!"}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in the area, he wanted me to take to the local Pittsburg institution of hangout places... it seems this place is very popular with the locals, especially the college students.  This location is their original store, thus it has lot of history... don't expect anything fancy, the place looks old and you definitely get that feeling when you walk in.  Also, CASH ONLY, so you better bring them, otherwise use the ATM machine by the main entrance to get cash... don't leave home without CASH!!!

When I visited, it wasn't busy, since it was spring break for the students.  We seated ourselves... then looked at the menu to decide what I wanted to get.  The waitress came and took our drink orders.... after our drink arrived, I asked what was the most popular and she informed me that it was cheesesteak, but I wasn't into it, so I decided to go with cornbeef and cheese with no onions.  

The server wasn't happy nor sad, she just seemed preoccupied, as she wasn't that friendly... maybe because she was the only one working the floor? I don't know, but she didn't make me feel welcomed while I was there... but again, serve all depends on who you get, thus the person we got today... well, let's just say she wasn't having a good day.

So we get our food... the sandwich is piled high, since they put the french fries and cole slaw on top of the meat.... (you can ask them on the side if you want)... but a true sandwich lover will never do that!  Prepare to open your mouth wide open.... if you can unlock your jaw, do it!

I ate the 1/2 of the sandwich, then the 2nd half, I deconstructed to try each item separately to how they held up on their own....

Cornbeef - the meat was good, not salty... 

French Fries - tasted like they cut them on site, but little soggy in my opion

Cole Slaw - the look and feel of the slaw reminds me of the Carolina's style... but it's very very BLEND.... need more salt and other seasoning.

Of all the sandwich shops I've been in Midwest, East & West coast... Primanti Brothers  doesn't fall on my top 10.... one thing that keeps bringing people - the cost... the sandwiches are cheap!!

If you are in Pittsburg, swing by and try it for yourself... see if Primanti Brothers stack up to other deli shops you've visited."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm from Pittsburgh and will and always come here when we come into town. It's  the only place I have been  to where they put the fries on the sandwich.  The sandwiches are huge, and my wife got 2 meals out of her roaat beef sandwich."}
{"text":"If you're from Pittsburgh, you already know.

If you aren't, I shouldn't torture you.

If you're there and you don't know, then you aren't from Pittsburgh.  You need to go.  You need to go right now.  Don't even finish reading this review.  Go right now.

You should be reading this sentence with hands full of Primanti sandwich.  If you aren't, I implore you to take a long, serious look at your life, and where it's leading you."}
{"text":"Came here with another couple who are from here. We ordered at same time.  We sat at the counter. They got their food after 5-10 minutes. We got ours 25 minutes later.  We saw orders both dine in take out come after our order - they went out while we still waited for ours.  Sitting at the counter,  we saw what we thought was our order on the grill just frying on the there for a long time.  We asked the skinny guy with glasses who was our waiter what happened to our sandwiches- he hand gestures towards the grill and mumbles something while walking quickly away. We finally get our food after the other couple 
had almost finished. Sure enough the food that had been sitting on the grill was ours - it was over cooked and burned.  I sent it back - showed the gal my burned pastrami sandwich.  Her response was that the black or burn was my pastrami.  She has an attitude and reluctantly made me a new one in 5 minutes. The ice tea tasted old and we had to wait until we got the bill to get a refill.  In watching this operation from the counter they were more interested in singing the words to piped in music than serving the customers. This staff needs some serious lessons in public relations and social skills. For the most part they were rude and inattentive.  The food was ok.  I felt bad for the other couple who brought us here - they apologized several times for the service and our bad experience.  People make or break a business- too bad a few employees can tarnish a businesses reputation- I will not recommend this place - sorry. One star - should be no star, no tip, not coming back Ever!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I know this is a Strip District staple, but I am not a fan. The cole slaw is pretty non-descript (i.e. flavorless). The fries are frequently soggy (unless you're there late at night when they are served up fresh). The homemade bread is very good and so is the meat, but the whole sandwich thing is just not for me. Many folks like it, so that's great. Just not me..."}
{"text":"The service has been really good every time I've gone to this location. I've had several of their sandwiches and their pizza; all of it was good, though I do think the sandwiches are a bit overhyped. The best is the steak sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the Pittsburgh native's Mecca.  We all at one point in our lives must make the trip to the Strip district, wait in a really long line, and have an amazing sandwich which is part of our heritage.  When it is something you have had all of your life, you can't disparage it by giving the restaurant less than 5 stars.  

So why are some of the reviews 1 star and 2 stars?  I guess some foodies expect a Tom Colicchio quality sandwich for the whopping $4.95 they are forking over.  I think you can only expect so much in way of presentation at this price point and need to reflect on the heritage of this fine institution and the part it plays in Pittsburgh culture."}
{"text":"This is probably my least favorite primanti bros in Pittsburgh. The food service is horrible. It took the server more than 30 mins to greet us. On top of all the time it took to greet us.. the food also took forever. It seemed so short staffed inside and the staff is very unpleasant to the customers. I hope primantis is able to fix this location because it makes me never want to come back."}
{"text":"I only went here because its a big name in Pittsburgh and anyone from here or who visited would say 'GO TO PRIMANTI!!!!' The inside is indescribable to me but reminds me if applebees met a subway. The service here is rude service intentionally, very short and in a hurry. 

I wasn't blown away with the sandwiches and I don't get what the big deal is. I wasn't really amazed by them. I suppose its just the pittsburgh thing to do, one thing off my bucket list. 

Cash only. 

I'd come back here."}
{"text":"Have to say that service was bad. I was sitting at the bar,there was not even 5 people, and the bartender girl was tripping hard-core......like there was 50 of us. Totally confuse 
Any ways,i ordered Chicken Cajun Sandwich from their famous sandwich menu. It was a fine white meat,friend w cajun seasoning on 2 pieces of french bread w fries,tomatoes and swiss cheese. It was OK,can't say i was blown away....sorry ( not trying to be party pooper) nothing special. In Chicago we have a place with same concept . Maybe because i already tried it before i think what i think.....or i don't know....thats me.
Still,if you never had anything like that and you are in the Pittsburg area,stop by"}
{"text":"These are the most amazing sandwiches I've ever had. The sandwiches are pretty tall and stuffed with coleslaw and fries instead of having the coleslaw and fries on the side. Also, prices are reasonable and food preparation is fast. One downside, if you're physically challenged, is the restrooms are located downstairs."}
{"text":"I usually go to Primanti Brothers in the Strip District but this location is pretty similar, only with reduced operating hours. (Their Strip District location is open 24/7.) I like the sandwiches. It seems Pittsburgh is the only place where I can find sandwiches stuffed with fries and coleslaw. It's a copious amount of food for not a lot of money and Primanti compares favorably in value to most other restaurants in the Pittsburgh downtown area. Only problem I can see is the restroom is a bit dingy and down a flight of stairs, which may be difficult for those with disability."}
{"text":"This is Primanti for when you can't make it to downtown Pittsburgh. I actually prefer the Monroeville location for ambiance and service, but the North Versailles location is not bad either.

Basically, I ignore everything on the menu except for the Primanti sandwiches. These are sandwiches where the fries and coleslaw are stuffed into the sandwich. If the fries are seasoned adequately and the coleslaw is not too sour, there's nothing quite like it. It's the sandwich I look forward to on my annual Pittsburgh trips, although perhaps not so much any more since I can now visit the new Primanti location in York."}
{"text":"This Primanti Brothers is a bit tricky to navigate to since the access road (off Northern Pike) doesn't look like it would go there but actually does. You have to use this little access road and go around a corner past a closed store. Then you'll see that Primanti Brothers has a separate parking area with a great view of the hilly town of Monroeville. I actually like this restaurant better than the one in the Strip District even if prices at the Monroeville location are a bit higher. Service is courteous and you get the exact same sandwiches stuffed with fries and coleslaw as you do at the Strip District location. I'm glad I stopped here on the way out of the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Apparently a Pittsburgh tradition. Had the pastrami sandwich which had a lot of fries, but hardly any pastrami. The fries weren't very good either -- took them off and was left with a sub-par sandwich."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try a Primanti Bros. sandwich after hearing about them from TV for years. Although this was not the original location (there are about 10) around it was a cool place. I tried the steak and cheese sandwich which of course comes with french fries and slaw piled high on the sandwich. I enjoyed it, but was not blown away. I think it was a little on the dry side even with the slaw. Maybe i should have added mayo or oil etc. I think i may like it better if i choose a sandwich on the cold side like salami or bologna etc. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"After years of seeing this place on every Sandwich Show the Travel Channel aired I decided to make the 50 mile detour on my way to Columbus, OH. 

Three friends and myself walked into the place at 330am, weary from the road and hungry as ever. We picked our own seat and within a few minutes our drink order was taken and delivered. Our Sandwich order was taken just then and within another 10 mins we were scarfing down these oh so good sandwiches. 

The bread: soft, thick and held the whole thing together nicely. 
The slaw: crunch, fresh, flavorful. 
The fries: not oily at all, very tasty and plentiful. 
The black angus: cooked to perfection, not rubbery. 
The hot sausage: sausage was good, but not better than my NYC italian sauage sandwiches. 

All said, it was a good experience, I'm glad I made the trip, the sandwiches satisfied our hunger and I got to visit Pittsburgh where Heinz ketchup was born. I won't be making a 6 hour drive just for these anytime in the future, but if I am near there I will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"I love primanti bros, and this is my neighborhood restaurant where I most frequently stop. I've never had a bad experience here.  The food and the service are great and they really have some amazing happy hour deals! The place is never ever empty but I've never had to wait for a table. Staff is good, bartenders are friendly and cooks very competent. I've never had an order that wasn't correct. 

Great place to go for a casual meal, and if you don't like these sandwiches then get the heck outta Pittsburgh! :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and cool atmosphere, cheesesteak is more like a hamburger but still good, dont forget fries come on the sandwich!"}
{"text":"The food is unhealthy and mediocre. The ambiance is too loud to allow you relax and eat. Not wanting to lard up, I ordered a vegetable soup (meh), a side salad (meh), and a pickle (good). My friend ordered a Garden Patch Salad with Fries and they spoiled it by putting tasteless melted cheese on the fries. Bad music was playing at high volume (this was Sunday, 10pm). I guess this chain appeals to lovers of grease, cheese, and noise, but not me. The next time I need mere sustenance I'll make myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at home - it would be far more enjoyable than a return to Primanti Brothers."}
{"text":"First off, I am giving 1 star because 0 stars is not an option.  We ordered the mozzarella half moons.  Complete garbage!  The half moons had 0 mozzarella in them.  One of the key things I was looking for in a mozz stick was mozz.  Next I split the cajun chicken sandwich.  It was dry and crappy but OK.  Afterward, I split the Pittsburger.  Worst sandwich ever!  The burger was a black dry hockey puck.  We heard that this was a must visit while in Pittsburgh.  This is a must skip!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pittsburgh multiple times and was always told to try primanti.  Underwhelmed is a good way to describe the experience.  In my opinion it tasted like a greasy French fry sandwich since fries were at least 60% of the sandwich itself.  I ordered the primanti favorite which i felt had very little meat on the sandwich. 

I wasn't impressed and one time was enough for me."}
{"text":"Food was average. Appreciated the dining room and the service was great. The floor under our table was dirty but otherwise it was a fine experience."}
{"text":"5 stars should not be something you give to many, but this place deserves it. When you have created something that no one even tries to copy because they just can't you know you have the best. 

We got a Capicola and cheese and the boys split the combo cheese both were excellent. It may seem weird for you to throw slaw, tomatoes, and fries on a sandwich, but just do it. Matt hates slaw, but after I insisted he at least try it he was sold and quickly put some on his. 

The best part of course is that our kids loved it too. Which is what for us sets these guys over the top."}
{"text":"I've been going to Primanti Brothers for years. I always get the corned beef. The best corned beef sandwich ever. I've been to the Strip, Market Square, and North Versailles locations. I loved the pizza as well that I got at the North Versailles location."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! My boyfriend had never eaten here, but grew up in Pittsburg and had heard great things. The corned beef was fine, but the fries on my sandwich were awful; undercooked, no salt and no flavor. The coleslaw was great, but the sandwich was too dry. Also the table was super sticky and seating was confusing. I won't be making a stop by next time in town."}
{"text":"Solid place for a Yuengling and a greasy sandwich. Try the Pittsburgher, a cheesesteak with a heaping helping of cole slaw and fries. A Pittsburgh institution, something that's worth checking out before leaving town."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant.

My friend and I were in town for the weekend, so we had to hit up Primanti's. I lived in the 'burgh for about three years, and have had it before (from the dahn-tahn location) but my friend hadn't.

We came in at 1pm on a Sunday, certainly not busy at all. We sat at a table by the bar for about 15 minutes being ignored until we got fed up and sat at the bar instead. 

My friend and I ordered a sandwich each and I asked for no cole slaw. Seeing as how I'm pretty sure that these sandwiches are not pre-made, I didn't think it was a big deal. The waitress stared blankly at the ceiling and replied \"I'll see what I can do.\" Eventually, our food got there and it was okay, not the greatness I had built up to my friend.

It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to bring the tab after asking for it (I almost thought about committing my first dine and ditch out of mercy). We had to flag down a different waitress to take our money. For the first time in my life, I left no tip."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! After some difficulties in securing dinner, my dad and I found ourselves at one of the billion Primanti's locations for a quick feast. I haven't ever been happier to see Angry Orchard on the menu, and once my dad was settled with a Blue Moon, we got to business - kielbasa for me, Angus steak for him, and fried pickles to start. The pickles were 5 star deliciousness! I just loved them, and may have pushed my dad out of the way to claim the last as my own. The sandwiches were yummy too! I loved the kielbasa itself, but had to hunt to find the promised cheese. The coleslaw is really excellent - tangy and light, and I personally like it a lot on the sandwich itself. The fries were less excellent. I don't know if they would have been better on the side rather than on the sandwich, but they were kind of cold, soggy, and unsalted. Didn't stop me from eating them, though. I think that if the fries were better, this would be a 4 star establishment."}
{"text":"This is an unpopular opinion, but oh well: I've lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and don't understand the hype behind Primanti Brothers. Their pizza is delicious, I will give them that, but the classic \"Pittsburgh personified\" sandwich with cole slaw and fries on it, while creative, is nothing to write home about. You could get something more flavorful by walking into the prepared foods section of any gas station along the way. I'm serious. 

Any time I've had the misfortune of being taken to Primanti's, especially at this location (which is dirty and trashy), I choose not to eat. I'd actually prefer not to eat at all than to waste my money on a sandwich with bread that has the consistency of the dried-out kitchen sponge you've had on your counter for too long and fries that taste kind of like kindling. No flavor, no texture, nothing of value. The meat stuffed inside isn't too bad, but to eat a sandwich with just the meat in mind isn't the best use of your money either. The cole slaw is lackluster. 

Yes, Primanti's has other items on its menu, but I have never seen anything there that made me want to jump for joy and get it into my stomach as fast as possible. The more 'restaurant-like' locations (such as the one in Harmar) offer a bigger menu with more palatable food. I've had nice big salads there. But the Strip Primanti Brothers is a greasy, nasty place. I'd rather eat the wax paper your sandwich is served on.

If you're visiting Pittsburgh as an out-of-towner, go to Primanti's if you want to go, \"Why is this place the talk of the town?,\" or for a good value, but not for quality food or for a meal actually worth your time."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was a little slow out in the patio! All in all it was good!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Pittsburgh, the sandwiches here are a must! Order whatever sandwich you want and they throw they're signature cole slaw and fries on their sandwich to compliment the tasty italian bread and meat of choice. As a consumer of food usually in the New York/ New Jersey area, my taste pallet is hard to please! But the cole slaw here is unrivaled (and I'm generally not a big fan of cole slaw) and I can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"I must admit, I was a bit skeptical about trying the Primanti Bros. Sandwich. For some reason, putting french fries on a sandwich was so foreign to me, but boy am I glad I sucked it up and gave it a try.

I had the pastrami sandwich (double meat). You can tell they use high quality meats, because the pastrami was very tender. It paired well with the tang and crunch of the coleslaw. 

Their french fries are delicious. I'm not sure what type of oil they use, but the fries have a distinct flavor that add an extra punch to the sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing, unique sandwiches! Very great for late night drunken romps or after a show. If your'e in Pittsburgh its a must try! Though, like the cheese steaks in Philly you better know what you're ordering or the cooks get pissed."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh classic. Nothing new, nothing bad nor out of this world. Service is fine. I'd go back."}
{"text":"In town for a wedding and decided to make our way to Primanti Brothers after hearing about it so much. I am from Chicago and I have been to Philly so I was expecting the Italian beef and Philly cheesesteak equivalent of Pittsburgh instead I got the MOST bland sandwich I have ever had. We tried the sirloin and cheese and the so called #2 rated pittsburger sandwich and we were disappointed. 

There was barely any meat and all I tasted was fries. The coleslaw was bland. I don't know how a sandwich with meat cheese and fries have no flavor?! The pittsburger was even worse! It tasted like a Salisbury steak you get at the super market put in a piece of bread.

Over all very disappointed in this place. I ate my sandwich coz it was late and I was starving but I feel disgusted. The service was nothing exceptional either. There were no lids for the drinks which was weird.

Would not go here again or recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh, without all the parking hassle.  This location is easily accessible from I-79 and just a little ways from the Parkway (now I-376).

My favorite is the capicola & cheese.  The chili is underrated and quite spicy.

If you're a Primanti's virgin, resist the urge to make any alterations to the Primanti's sandwich recipe -- you will like it!

The food tastes the same here as all the other locations. Pick some up on your way to the airport and carry on to the plane!"}
{"text":"So took a visit to Pittsburg over the weekend and always make an effort to try the local hotspots.....thus came across Primanti....upon walking in, the place was not over crowded which was a bit surprising. Ordering was at ease and with a smile..preparation....I hate when the grill keeps mix and match the food all over the place, I mean you had pastrami cooking near ham, and eggs near roast beef.... Maybe I like my taste specific to what I ordered. That being said went with the big fish sandwich with some hot  peppers. Upon opening the bag, i found a hefty sandwich which was a good starting point. The bread which I was a bit skeptical about actually tasted real good, fresh and a bit of tangy taste which i always like. The fish was about 9 inch filled with slaw & tomatoes. Overall not bad and worth a try but not overwhelmingly wow..... That being said what I did notice while watching them make the other sandwiches was their a bit shy with the meats, I mean who eats pastrami with 4 slices, the top off are the fries and slaw which adds to the size....one time try for me"}
{"text":"Disappointing sandwich, not worth the hype. Maybe we came on an off day, but the sandwich was bland and nothing special in my opinion."}
{"text":"I know this place is legendary to a Pittsburgh native. 

I've had a couple \"cheese steaks\" both sober and buzzed.

I don't get it. The bread is too thick, the French fries are over powering,the cold slaw has no business being in a sandwhich and the cheese steak is what I'd call a minute steak.

I think it's mass appeal comes from the days when this was one of the only late night resturants. It gave them drunks a chance to sober up before headed home. 

Just saying I'm not from Pittsburg and we got options now. Even Primanti's has options now. I roll with the chicken strips for my late night dine. 

P"}
{"text":"It is exactly as described... fast, fresh food with fries and slaw on the sandwich. The food comes out very quickly so there were a lot of people doing to go orders. The staff was friendly and attentive. It can get VERY crowded so if you don't want to wait, you really need to plan to go during a slow time. They are open 24 hours, so we went for breakfast but I don't mind a big sandwich and some chili cheese fries for breakfast. What better way to start the day?"}
{"text":"One of a kind!!!! Love the pastrami or the capicola!!!! Seriously before you die you need to visit primanti's, grab their famous sandwich piled high with Cole slaw and fries, and an IC light or two. There's not much else to be said except do not skip this pittsbirgh tradition."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential Pittsburgh Meal, it is what I ate after a late night of drinking in the south side, strip, or Oakland. This is a burgh staple like the Dirty O, or Cat on a Stick after a night at the bar. that being said now that I am arrived and settled down, with a couple of kids it is nice to hit the Suburban Primanti's for a meal with the family, you can sit and enjoy a beer and a sandwich, and bring the kids without it being shady, and I can reminisce about my lost drunken youth, in a family friendly way.

And if you have never had a Primanti's sandwich, it is a requirement to live in the burgh, and if you are particularly brave, try the imported sardine, actually one of their best offerings. Particularly with beer."}
{"text":"Worth the trip from CA! Walked the awesome city from Hinez field had a cold beer, grill lady was awesome had best seat in the house. Lucky me! Great service"}
{"text":"Don't know what's so special about this chain. The food was sub-par. Just adding fries to a greasy, tasteless sandwich does not make anything better. But I have to say the service was really good. The waitstaff was really friendly."}
{"text":"First off, the person making the sandwich grabbed the slaw for the sandwich out of the bin without gloves on, that's disgusting.  Beyond that, I have absolutely no idea what native Pittsburghers see in this place.  Soggy sandwich that turns into a complete mess because they use regular Italian bread.  Overall, the sandwich was just bland.  Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered  3 sandwiches to go.
Grilled baloney-no cheese
egg/cheese
egg/cheese and bacon.
Came to $20.00 and change....
and truthfully the potatoes were not quite done. Probably needed 1 minute more in fryer.
Never had an a la dente fry before.
Had hard time finding bacon...maybe there was 1.5 strips.
For almost $7.00 a sandwich, I think its time I said goodbye to one of my favorite places.
Too expensive and the value and quality is just not there anymore. I know there are new owners, but 
that's way too  much for 3 simple sandwiches plus the lack of bacon on mine.
It's a shame."}
{"text":"I walked in, sat down, and ordered an IC light. Looked around, and realized that this restaurant looks awfully like one of the restaurants I saw on the food network where the guy goes around and eats these ridiculously large meals. After eating a Pittsburgher (the second most popular dish) and trying the colossal fish sandwich, and a capicola sandwich, I've decided that the best part of my meal was the IC light. 

My friend's colossal fish was the best of the three and it's best eaten as two meals. My Pittsburgher was the pitts and I wouldn't order it again. Unlike your pitts on a 90+ degree day, it was really dry. The sandwich was only salvaged by my grotesque use of hot sauce. The concept isn't that ridiculous either. Just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich. The chili cheese fries were mediocre as well, but the portion again was hugemongous.

I'd come back here if I were in Pittsburgh again because its just a nice place to chill at on Market Square. But the food is only serviceable. Substituting quantity with quality can only get you so far.

The ambiance, service, atmosphere, and tradition makes this place pretty unique, but it don't make the food taste better."}
{"text":"Been hearong about this place all weekend long. Came here for a conversation and this place is the talk of the town. Im originally from chicago and i can say i wish we had something like this. Had the premany burger. Calslaw on it was amazing ill definitely come again"}
{"text":"OMG...first introduced in 2000 by my daughter who attended Pitt.  I was very impressed with the food service and the College atmosphere. Reminded me of my college days. I first thought eating everything on one sandwich was insane. Boy was I wrong...it was delicious and not greasy like I was expecting. It's a sandwich you buy for the whole day...For me it was lunch dinner and some for the next day! So if you ever are in Pittsburgh stop by and have something good...for now and later!"}
{"text":"We visited this location twice during our stay in the P'burgh.  

Primanti's is a classic experience here, from what I'm told, but I'll be honest - I'd never heard of it before Adam Richman decided that he was going to shove an entire sandwich down his gullet here.  But the idea of a huge sandwich with a bunch of fries and cole slaw shoved in the middle sounded pretty good - so we stopped.

You have to order your sandwich from the huge board that they have (if you're in the back section - if you're at the counter, it's located over the grills) - there's no \"menu\" here, per se.  I think that this is all they do - sandwiches and nothing more.  Don't come in expecting a huge variety of dishes.  

The first time we came, we dined in and were seated in the back.  I ordered a cappicola and egg sandwich, since this is what A.R. used as an example and he'd proclaimed it \"delicious\".  Well, it was definitely good, I will say that much - but I wish that the egg had been just a little \"runnier\" in the middle.  I like hard-cooked yolks as a rule, but in this case, a softer yolk would have made the dish.  Also, the sandwich was not nearly as big as it looked on television - I ate it and was like, \"Uh... still kind of hungry over here.\"  Kind of shocked, to be honest.  

They bring these to you on wax paper - no plates.  I was a little taken aback by that at first, but I got used to it.  Neat, actually.

The cole slaw is absolutely delicious.  I wish I had the recipe, because I'd make it at home all the time.  Fries were hot and added a nice touch to the sandwich - not bad at all.

The second time we came in was when we were literally on our way home - we stopped here before hitting the freeway.  This time I got a \"colossal fish\" - and ate it warmed up at home a few hours later.  Honestly, I think that the colossal fish was MUCH better - that sandwich was a monster size and I had trouble finishing it.  Again, the fries and cole slaw added to the texture and taste experience.  I'd probably recommend this over the cappicola version.  It was even great microwaved at home hours later, believe it or not.

My second sandwich was also made by Ms. Toni herself (the woman that Adam Richman interviewed), so I don't know if that had anything to do with how much better it tasted.  I bet it did, though!

Service is a little lacking, but not enough for me not to come back.  

Good stuff, and we'll be back to try other versions of the sandwich.  

Worth a stop if you're visiting the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Primantis can be hit or miss. 
Make sure you go during slower periods of the day and try to eat the sandwich at the restaurant if you can so everything will be fresh or the food gets soggy and rather quickly."}
{"text":"My husband was born and raised in Pittsburgh, so after seeing this place featured on the food network, I wanted to try it because I am not from the area.

As hubby silently rolled his eyes and urged me to rethink my decision while reluctantly  giving in to my wish to go to Primanti, we drove into a crowded parking lot.

Upon entering this sports type bar, the  loud environment with TVs everywhere didn't bode well with me for such a great experience.. I only came for the food, not the noise. Certainly not a place for conversation, but it appears a place for the Pittsburgh fans to hang out. 

  I tried the pastrami sandwich done the Primanti way, with Cole slow and fries on the sandwich. Loaded with Cole slaw and fries (not enough pastrami but they do have a double meat version if you are interested) I found the sandwich to be good, not great.
The Cole slow was sweet, and the fries were just greasy and so so.

Hubby was kind enough to not say \"I told you so\".

Went for the experience, and won't be needing to do it again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a drive home from Sandusky, OH after hearing about it from some friends and also on Man versus Food.   The very high expectations we had were not met.  The entire staff were great and super friendly but the sandwiches themselves were a little disappointing.  Hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway.  Scrapped that all off. Nothing special. We shared the corned beef and the salami.   The bread was fresh but so think between the bread and the fries with no salt it over powered the small amount of meet.  So sure it's a huge sandwich at a great price if you want bread with flavorless potatoes on it.  No need to go back but glad we finally tried it.   I do give the fried pickles a 5.  Probably some of the best i have had.  They saved this meal somewhat."}
{"text":"We visited because Primanti Brothers is obviously famous and we wanted to see what the hype was about.  It was a 95-degree day and their open-door facility offered shade but was still quite warm.  Our server was quick and attentive.  I ordered the bacon and cheese but it seemed more like a Coleslaw and french fry sandwich.  Perhaps I would have liked a heartier bread (like a bun) and more bacon or a better distribution of the ingredients on the bread.  We could reach one and sometimes two PokéStops from our table."}
{"text":"What's to say about Primanti Brothers that hasn't already been said?

I got the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak. I was unimpressed by the taste, but totally blown away by the food itself. As someone who can't eat a lot of bread, I found it still delicious when sharing with my friend. If i were to go again (which I probably will) I'll order the Reuben with an egg. That just sounds fun.

I also had the fries covered in cheese, chili, and sour cream. After reading other reviews about the bacobits I opted to not get those - I do have watch my figure after all! :)

The food comes quick. We go in, ordered, sat down, ate, and cleaned up within 30 minutes. Granted this was like a Thursday evening and I was going simply because EVERYONE said I had to go when I visited Pittsburgh, so I can't say it's like that every night. But when they're not busy, it's quick. When they are busy be prepared to order your food...properly. Apparently late night if you order incorrectly they'll kick you out of line and make you go to the back. Fair enough, drunk people gotta have their meat on bread ASAP. Now, don't ask me what \"ordering correctly\" means cause I don't understand. But I have a feeling it's like being rushed to order your hash browns at the Waffle House - smothered, covered, and diced please."}
{"text":"I hate Shitsburgh, but this place does it right! Hands-down the best sandwich on the planet"}
{"text":"For me, this place sums up Pittsburgh.   Utilitarian, hardly an ounce of bullsh*t, and made to do what it set out to do.

I love Primanti's, and eat here every time I'm in town.   Its not the best sammitch I've ever had, but I love the style, the atmosphere and the food.   

I'm partial to the pastrami, but they're all good.   Eat with one hand, and gesture to Ravens fans with the other.    Or use your cell phone.   Whatever you're into.   

Five stars."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere especially if it's nice outside to sit and eat. The food is good and it's a staple here in Pittsburgh. Easy to pick from menu and very friendly service. Beer here is great too!"}
{"text":"This is a Pittsburgh area tradition apparently, so I decided to try it out while I was in the area for work.  I LOVE the concept of the fries and sweet and sour coleslaw piled on the sandwich, but the quality of the meat on the sandwich was horrible; a big mouthful of fat and gristle with each bite."}
{"text":"So I understand this is the original location for Primanti Bros - is that right?  My sister-in-law and her husband were trying to talk me out of eating here... \"nasty sandwich\" is the phrase she used to describe it and I shrugged my shoulders.  Last Monday, she took us to breakfast @ Pamela's but I made a big deal about how I wasn't going to spoil my appetite and would hold out for one of your sandwiches - my sister-in-law was all like \"you won't like it\" but I pretended I couldn't hear her - she insisted on waiting in the car with the kids... whatever.  I ordered the hot sausage sandwich and it was a heart-stopper.  The lady at the grill was super nice and asked me where I was from and explained the Primanti to me... \"all ingredients are fresh, etc etc\" - at one point, what I believe was their tomato vendor came in to order a sandwich and she sent him back to get some more tomatoes... she spoke freely in the expletive vernacular - it was honestly refreshing.  Oh yeah - my sister-in-law, she's from St. Louis and is a college professor (in theology), so I hope that explains where she's coming from and why I cannot take her food critique seriously.  Some people eat sandwiches holding their pinkies out (she and her husband are that kind of sandwich eaters) but looking to my left and right @ the lunch counter, I don't think I saw any pinkies sticking out... just saying.

Your sandwiches are delicious and I look forward to having another one if/when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. Primanti's is one of Pittsburgh's most well know food joints in the country. Their signature dish is a deli sandwich with any meat you could imagine topped with provolone cheese, fresh cut fries, vinegar based coleslaw, and two fresh tomato slices. All packed into fresh slices of Italian bread. If that sounds appealing to you, it will be everything you imagine. If that doesn't sound your fancy, Primanti's also has excellent pizza, awesome wings, and some of the best loaded fries in all of Pittsburgh with the Smallman fries. Add in some quick, and unique service and you have a food legend that lives up to its name. Get a taste if you ever make your way to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Primanti's why do you LOOK amazing, but taste so sad?

This concept is genius, the execution is not. I am told, the idea behind it is that steel workers needed something grab and go so they would pile everything including the fries, cole slaw and deli meat in one and wrap it up for them. 

Here's my problem with this place. Why is the bread plain fluffy, starchy, stale white bread? It's not grilled, or buttered, and I might even be okay with that, but the weird part for me is just that is it not quality bread. If you are slingin' sammies all day why not invest in some good locally made bread?  

Fries on a sammie? YES PLEASE! I appreciate that they are hand cut. But mine were cold, sad and had absolutely no seasoning on them. It was like piling bland on top of bland. 

Last but not least the burger was NOT a burger. It was almost like a fake piece of meat or a JTM. I could not believe this was the standard here, and what they were KNOWN for! And the pastrami? I guess I was expecting a slow roasted juicy, succulent pastrami. This was shaved razor thing, and it was served cold. 

The pros - it's a tradition, and at least worth trying it to say you did it, and the concept is quirky and fun, but I just can't get over the execution and how low quality the ingredients used here are. Maybe they have fallen into the \"people will eat it no matter what stage\" and are ok with serving food like this, but that would make me really sad."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service by Nicole and the rest of the staff and delicious food as we always receive from Primanti Bros. 

Thankful we stopped in tonight ! We will be back again soon .

We had the brothers burger , honey buffalo wings & my son enjoyed a personal pizza with sausage, pepperoni and bacon . All delicious!"}
{"text":"Honest opinion... they're good... but I don't see the point in putting coleslaw AND fries on every single sandwich. I ate the first half of it and it was okay. I took the fries off the 2nd half and I enjoyed it more. It seems like more of a gimmick to me. Worth every penny of the $11.65 I paid for sure. I'm super full and am in a great place. Now maybe my recent decision to give up red meat has hindered my choices on restaurant menus and perhaps the coleslaw/fry combination on a different sandwich would've gone better with perhaps their roast beef, pastrami or corned beef options."}
{"text":"First trip to Pittsburgh last weekend, and first trip to Primanti Brothers. 

This place is a legend so it's worth the trip just for that. The sandwiches aren't bad either. Huge! I had the capicolla with cheese, and the requisite fries and cole slaw on the sandwich. The fries were pretty soggy and I ended up taking most of them off just so I could manage to eat the sandwich without it falling apart. Our friend the PA hometown boy had fun showing us the ropes. You stand in line at a chaotic counter, pick your sandwich, and you're on your way pretty quickly if you're carrying out (which we were.) There's table seating too but the servers were dealing with a post-last-call crowd and we didn't feel like waiting. 

We ended up in the place after a night out and it's fun to see so many people hanging out and eating freakishly large sandwiches at 3 a.m. I'd do it again in a minute. I don't know if I'd be convinced to try the egg on it, but I'd go for a corned beef...Capicolla was yummy, though, and so was the bread."}
{"text":"It's a classic! Can't hate on that. Haven't had a complete trip to the Pitts without eating at primanti brothers. Ya know when you have a heaping pile napkins that it's finger Lickn' good. Always Cheap and fulfilling..doesn't get better than that. Cajun chicken is the bomb I must say."}
{"text":"Made a visit to Pitt for an interview and everyone said that Primanti Bros. was the best in town. Although I had a great sandwich of Cappi and Egg it was somewhat drowned out by the fries and coleslaw on the sandwich. I was forced to douse the sandwich in hot sauce to regain some flavor. The atmosphere of a true blue collar bar offering a true blue collar sandwich paired with a tasty beer did make up for it though. Overall a decent sandwich with a great Pitt atmosphere but the sandwiches are nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience! I went to the one near Pitt at lunch, and aside from the difficulty I had finding parking, I enjoyed trying a sandwich from this iconic Pittsburgh chain. I went with the capicola sandwich, and of course, it came on thick, white bread, vinegar-y coleslaw that was crunchy and generous, and french fries on the sandwich itself. It was a big sandwich! I thought the ratio of meat to bread to coleslaw to french fries seemed to be a little low on the meat side, but it was still worth experiencing. I sat upstairs, and our server was friendly and on top of our dining experience, even though it was during lunch time on a week day. I recommend trying it out for a unique sandwich experience."}
{"text":"I can respect Primanti's and the following they have, but I just don't like their sandwiches that much.  I probably have them once a year b/c someone from out of town wants to go there.  

Sometimes I forget how much I don't like the sandwiches until that one time a year.  Sorta how you perceive the Holidays to be this joyous time and then reality hits you and realize that's it's completely overrated.

I usually get the Cappicola and Cheese sandwich and it's alot of salty meat, with some bland fries, mild cole slaw, cheese completely hidden by the other ingredients between two slices of bread.  Maybe Primanti's should make up a secret sauce b/c it's always so damn dry.  

I think I need to learn my lesson and stop going there.  I would have given it 2 stars but it seems like such a Pittsburgh staple that I didn't have the heart to dock them any stars.  See, this Pittsburgh girl still gives props to her roots!"}
{"text":"We traveled all the way from Florida to have a sandwich.   We loved it.  Ive been to the one in Florida - which is also amazing.  But being at the original - was something special.   I had the best fish sandwich ever.   The coleslaw and fries made this fish sandwich over the top.  My siblings had pastrami and corned beef sandwiches.  They are New Yorkers and know from this.   They loved it too."}
{"text":"Prices 4 stars. Service 5 star. Food 3....husband and sons loved the sandwiches. Breads a bit thick for me. We also got French fries w chili and jalapeños. We were only disappointed w these Cajun dry rub wings. All of us found them tasteless.  We will probably go back...it's a landmark."}
{"text":"I like this location because it's new, clean and has more space.  This time I got a burger with pastrami, bacon, cheese, and banana peppers.  It was really good and reasonably priced.  I thought it came w a fried egg but was mistaken.  Think I'd add that next time. $10.99 with a huge side of fries and pickle.  The rest of the family went with their usual sandwich.  After a bite of my burger, they all agreed it was good and would have it next time."}
{"text":"So, the older white woman with the glasses (usually cooking) is a no-bs sort of lady, and I love it. She's a bit intimidating, but she's also the only reason why I come to this location.
Don't mess with her.

There's nothing tastier (imo) than the Pastrami & Cheese...

The Capicola probably has the most meat for a regular sandwich (& it's good too)...

BUT
If you're hungover, the fried bologna is like medicine! It's a tried-&-true cure to the dreaded Hangover.
Kinda bland in flavor though, so I'd recommend a dash of hot sauce.


PRO TIP:
Add an egg and any sandwich is now a breakfast-sandwich"}
{"text":"I just don't get it. This is supposed to be Pittsburgh's thing. But it's just not that great. Make pierogies Pittsburgh's thing. Oh wait, they're Polish ..."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh staple. All the Primantis fail to come close to the authenticity of the true Pittsburgh sandwich compared to the Strip District. You will find the same old woman working there for the past 20+ years. Make sure you don't ask her to change anything on your sandwich or she will tell you that \"this place isn't  a McDonald's get the hell out.\" And I love that. Can't miss with the Pittsburgher which is just your basic cheesesteak with all the good fixings. I love the closet fish. And honestly that is the only two things I order. I haven't been disappointed with anything else from what I've heard from everyone needs at this restaurant. Absolute staple for Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I once met a guy from Pittsburgh who had never been to Primanti's.  WTF!?!?  It's like being from DC and never going to Ben's Chili Bowl.  This place is an institution.  Yeah, they'll say \"they put fries on the sandwiches\" as if that's the only allure of this place.  Not at all.  Primanti's came out of the great depression when the steelworkers needed a full meal, so Primanti's put everything between two huge slices of bread.  Boom, there it is.  So imagine yourself coming in from a hard morning at the mill, starving and looking for a square meal in an easy-to-carry sandwich.  The bread is soft and fluffy, the meat is tender, and the steaming hot fries are cooled off by the cool cole slaw and tomato.  Every time I leave Primanti's, I want to go back, it's that good.  I imagine some steel workers looked forward to Primanti's as the only highlight of their workday. The only difference now is that you can watch the Stillers while you eat your sammich."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros is what much of the US knows culinary wise about Pittsburgh.  Sandwich with coleslaw & fries on it.  Simple, effective and gluttonous.  What else does one need?  Well I'll say this much, its something you should try at least once for the fact of saying you've had it.  Its one of the first things I tried in Pittsburgh.  You can go to this location or one of the others.  As for the sandwich itself, its ok.  Not a fan of the bread they use and would like to see more ingredient options: marinated steak, chicken cutlet, grilled eggplant.. to name a few.  The sandwich itself lacks that kick.  But again, its an institution so one must try it once.

As for this location and other options.  The pizza is decent.  The last time around I had the buffalo chicken salad it was good.  They have a large beer selection as well.  Plenty of TVs and seating to catch the game (although it does not seem that many football/soccer fans dine in).  Plenty of options for the rest of the group too."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at a Primanti Brothers. Our service was excellent, however the food was pretty terrible. We ordered the hot sausage sandwich and 10 wings. The fries on sandwich took away from the flavor, but I understand this is what makes the sandwich what it is. The wings came out room temperature at best. I couldn't tell you how they tasted because the temperature was such a put off. Not sure I'll make it back to a Primanti Brothers."}
{"text":"We came here on a work trip, expecting a typical sports bar.  Our waiter Matthew went through the menu with us and was terrific!  We got a couple sandwiches with the intent to split.  I guess it was a little more complicated so the manager came over to figure out exactly what we wanted!  Above and beyond service that is rare to come by these days!! Terrific place and service!"}
{"text":"Last time I was here I had one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.  My brother wanted to eat here and I was reluctant.  We walked in the door and I peeked around to see how many people were in the bar and the hostess ( I thought hostesses were supposed to be young girls) started having a steroid moment, yelling at me like I was a moron.  Saying, \" you have to tell me if you want a table or a booth.\"  Very condescending and demeaning.  Typical D bag yinzer that you find working at a place like this.  

The host sat us at a table in the bar and I enjoyed watching him clean my table and pick up garbage off the floor (I tossed all my used napkins under the table for him to pick up again).

It was so loud in the bar area my ears were ringing.  Our server was nice enough, and fortunately quick as well.  I usually have to force down their food with hot sauce and ketchup however, I found my wings and sandwich enjoyable.  

I may even have enjoyed the entire experience if Mr tough, tattoo guy hadn't been such an asshat and ticked me off from the get go.  

I just try to avoid this place.  The parking lot alone is on of the poorest designs I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I definitely recommend going to the original location as it's authentic. And sit at the bar and watch them making the sandwiches is fun too. The employee I met had been there, working doing the same exact thing for like 27 years. No kidding. Crazy. 

Counter was filled with locales and got a great sampling of Pittsburgh in the hour lunch visit. 

If you like everything piled all together, this is the place."}
{"text":"over priced  food and water down drinks  oj manager hes useless to talk to"}
{"text":"The crown jewel of any trip to Pittsburgh.  It had been four long years since my last Primanti sandwich...worse than forty years in the desert.  

My friends visited here three times in 24 hours.  Arriving a few hours after them, I only made it two times.  But thanks to a local Yelp thread, I was able to move our last two trips to the Strip location--open 24 hours!  (And trust me, it's a much different crowd on Sunday at 2pm than Sunday at 2am.)  Plus it's the original, so there is history here.  But in the end, it's all about the food.  

Thanks to that thread, we put egg on some of the sandwiches from trip #3 and tried some of the recommended meats--capicola and corned beef.  All was great advice.  Before I got there, they were ordering turkey and cheesesteak (both got thumbs-down from the thread posters).

Yes, this location is a little grungy (the restrooms are dreadful).  Yes, it is cash-only.  Yes, it is usually full or overflowing.  And yes, the waitress was surly.  So what?  It's one of the best sandwiches that you will ever eat in your life.  And six bucks is a steal.  I would pay double."}
{"text":"This spot totally lives up to the hype! The most amazing MASSIVE sandwiches ever. The kids had the fish, the wife had the rAgin Cajun and I had the pastrami! Everything was outstanding. And to top it off we were fortunate to get a picture with the lady who appeared in the episode on DDD. Worth traveling for and very reasonable prices for such large portions.Im home now and i cant stop thinking about that sandwich lol"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are massive.  Whatever you order winds up between two pieces of bread which seems both wrong and logical.  Regardless it is a mighty fine sandwich.  I wish I could get one right now..."}
{"text":"I don't remember what I ordered but it was stacked high and falling out.  A bunch of stuff stacked in a haphazard, vertical, meaty goodness.  It wore bacon for a belt.  Yummay.

I plan to be back.  I've only been here once, and I swear I died and I had gone to heaven. 

Good thing that if I had died, I'm glad that I'm near the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, one of the finest medical institutions in the nation - next to UCSD (but, I'm a bit of a homer).  

That said, San Diego is to Mexican food (carne asada anything), as Pittsburgh is to Primanti Brothers.  Is there a correlation between good food and medical miracles, YES.

Oy vey."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

Our first meal in Pittsburgh was not disappointing. 

The chili cheese fries came out super quick and were hot, fresh and flavorful. They had a little bit of spice, but were great!

The sandwiches (bacon and cheese, ham and St Pittsburg) were all really delicious and came out really quick. 

The feeling is kinda \"divey\", but really friendly. We will be back."}

What else to know: If you're in Pittsburgh, you have to stop by this place. French Fries and coleslaw in a sandwich, what's that all about? Well, don't knock it til you try it. Apparently, this is the blue collar choice of a lunch. You're not going to get any plates or utensils, just sandwich and wrapping paper. It's going to get messy but once you bite into the sandwich you're going to tell yourself it's all worth it.

{"text":"We were in town visiting schools and decided to try this place for a quick, casual dinner based on reviews. We had no trouble getting a table around 5:45pm and the service was friendly and efficient. This is basically a greasy spoon with a lot of local flavor but the food was quite good. As expected, the sandwiches were enormous, though my hungry teens had no trouble polishing them off. They're served on the table on paper, without utensils so remember to ask your waitress for a fork if you want one (upon request only). We each had the Pitts-burger (#2 Best Seller) except for one person who had the vegetarian black bean burger, which was also delicious. Fountain drinks were on the small side, but refilled quickly. All in all a good experience and no one left hungry. We'd be happy to return on our next visit."}
{"text":"I ate at the Strip location in the 80's while in college.
Have waited 20 years or so to be able to go back.

I've also visited the Cranberry location several times over the last few years while visiting the in-laws.  Good - but not the same as the Strip.

This time we visited over the Veteran's Day holiday.  Peak lunch time on a Friday afternoon.
A bit hard to find (since we hadn't been there in 20yrs) and parking was a bit of a nightmare.  But it worked out.

The place is larger than I remembered.  We sat in the dining room to the left of the entrance.  I don't remember that being there in the 80's.
Food was excellent.  Love the fries!  Love the sandwich with fries & slaw.

Highly recommend checking out this location."}
{"text":"Why order a sanwich, a side of fries and cole slaw when everything can come in one on the cheap?

I was in town for a conference at William Penn and made a point to check out Primanti after learning about their sandwiches from Samantha L. Conveniently located nearby the conference hotel on the other side of Macy's, the place is right off a small tunnel and somewhat easy to miss. The decor was interestingly rugged hole in the wall and reminds me of a no-nonsense working class diner with a few small wobbly tables, napkin dispensers and conventional condiments dispersed throughout.

It was already 2pm and my good friend from Texas and I were starving all day so our expectation was fairly high. My order of knockwurst sandwhich ($5.79) came with two thick slices of soft white bread with sliced knockwurst, cheese, cole slaw, special sauce, and a huge load of french fries tightly stacked in between. At first it looked like a tall order to finish it, but the delicious spongy white bread made it easy. I'm a big sausage fan but would have preferred something other than their knockwurst. Otherwise, the blend of melted cheese on square-shaped hearty fries and slightly tart and the not too saucy pickled slaw made it a sinful and yet delightful experience. 

Albeit the interesting concept, it was nonetheless a heart clogging meal so thank goodness that I don't have access to this type of sandwiches all the time. It is still a must try however, for any first time visitors to Pittsburgh. Service was brief and straight forward and my food was served on a paper plate. Thanks Samantha, for the wonderful recommendation! 3 stars for the worthwhile experience. I hope to be back."}
{"text":"One of the worst sandwiches I ever had in my life. I couldn't eat more than two bites. 

The so-called \"sandwiches\" here are 80% bread, 15% French fries and 5% meat. That's not an exaggeration. There is practically NO MEAT in these sandwiches. 

So basically it's a French fry sandwich. Which maybe would be passable if the bread and fries are good. They aren't. They don't make the bread themselves. It tastes just like two slices of Wonderbread stacked on top of one another. And the fries are starchy and limp. 

Limp fries between jumbo slices of Wonderbread. They have some real nerve calling this a \"sandwhich\". 

If you're thinking about coming here, someone from Pittsburgh probably told you this is where to go for sandwiches. It isn't. The Subway next door is tastier and more authentic. 

Terrible. Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"While the Downtown location doesn't have the extensive menu that the suburban locations have, any Primanti Brothers location will fill u up with one of the most unique sandwiches in the nation. Highly recommend the new Black Angus sandwich over the traditional \"No 2 Best Seller\" ... or go with Capicola and Egg. Both delicious!"}
{"text":"I thought it was good.  I got a pastrami which I love but I was talked into getting the cole slaw on it which normally I'm not a fan of.  If I was, I would have loved this sandwich.  But I'm not, so it was ok.  I would love to try it again \"my way\" and I'm sure it would be super!  4-stars for something different and good quality."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and I was fairly disappointed in the \"coleslaw and fries in the sandwich\" bonanza. It may have been that my expectations were sky high due to the hype from the Food Network reviews and my friend raving about it being a must-have in town. The service was quick, and the atmosphere was very casual and cool. We ordered the burger (which I would probably decide against if I ever go back, just to try another) and the fried pickles, which were also just alright (nothing amazing). They serve the sandwich on a piece of paper (parchment paper?) instead of baskets or dishes, which was a little disappointing considering that the city seems to have quite a sustainability initiatives (more than we have in Honolulu--yay Pittsburgh). It also seemed to change my perspective on the sandwich a tad... Overall, our party had mixed reviews on their meals. If I ever make it back to the Burgh, I would give it another shot. Maybe a different sandwich and a beer the next time around to wash it all down."}
{"text":"I thought I saw how awesome these sanwhiches were on the Travel Channel. I ordered the #2. It was very bland. Burger was dry and fries had almost no taste. I never add salt to my meals but this one needed it. It wasn't until later that I found out that the Pastrami was the one to order. Good service great prices and Pitt atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out since I was in Pittsburgh. We got the colossal fish sandwich. It was pretty good, wished we would have gotten corn beef or pastrami instead of the fish. The fish was still good. French fries on my sandwich. Why not. Service was ok, took them a while to realize we just sat down. I recommend them to clean their tables and chairs a little better. I sat on a chair and it was a little sticky. Other than that it wasn't too bad. Next time I go back to this place, I'll def have to try their sandwich with corn beef or  pastrami."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here, but the food wasn't as spectacular as I thought it was going to be. I've been twice and tried two different sandwiches to see if perhaps I just ordered wrong. But both times they were completely bland. The fries in the sandwich were pretty soggy and didn't have any seasoning. I kept wishing for some ranch or something to make it a little better."}
{"text":"This place is basically \"the place\" you hear about when you say you are going to Pittsburgh. And I am glad I tried it. I can see it being bringing back memories of college days to any alumni.

+fries are delicious in general, and this place is no exception. 
+cheap. 6 bucks for a sandwich or burger. You're not in San Francisco anymore. 
+coke products and not pepsi. Win. 

-I just don't eat this type of food if I can help it. White bread, well done cheap meat. 
-Fried everything. 

So, if you would like a burger with fries, on white bread and are not looking to see a green thing in sight, this is the perfect place and you won't be disappointed. If you are a college student, you should eat here at least 1X per month, if not more."}
{"text":"I went here with low expectations, thanks to some of the reviews below.  

You're going here for a deli sandwich with grilled meat and fries on it.  The fries are delicious and the sandwich has adequate proportions and is properly warmed up.  I'm not a slaw guy (the cook rightfully poked fun at me for this), but I'm sure that the slaw is fine as well.  They aren't asking an arm and a leg for these and sure, some other places have taken the idea and might offer fancier fare.  This isn't the place for fancy.  It's a place for a sandwich that tastes like everything awesome about Pittsburgh.  The place was staffed by 3 or 4 friendly dudes and my bill with double meat and a soda came out to under 10 bucks.  This is the original Primanti Bros., and it absolutely wails."}

Stopped in for lunch on Sunday.

I had the Kielbasa with cheese and my other half had The Pitts-burger (The #2 Bestseller). What is the #1 bestseller you ask? Why beer, of course. We had a couple of those also.

I enjoyed my Kielbasa with cheese, but the other half didn't like the Pitts-burger, and I can understand why. The burger was of an inferior quality, no angus beef here."}
{"text":"We made a trip to Pittsburgh a month back and a friend of mine insisted that we get a sandwich from Primanti's.  It was everything I'd hoped for.  I had a roast beef.  It was topped with slaw and fries and I threw a little hot sauce in there.

Wash it down with an Iron City."}
{"text":"Saw this on food network. We had to try it. 60 minutes from order to being able to eat the sandwiches. Good sandwich but not something I would want to eat frequently for a meal."}
{"text":"Burgers here isn't what you'd expect, but a definite sandwich loaded and packed to the extent you don't know where to begin!

Likes: Great for watching Pittsburgh team games, friendly bar atmosphere, comfort of food that's overloaded for reasonable prices, facilitates large groups, and the detailing is spot on with a lot of Pittsburgh-esque memorabilia such as Pirates or Steelers portraits and gear!

Dislikes: Not sure if it was my luck but the tables are maybe particularly curved and not flat (mind you, I've ate at this location twice and I always feel like I have to play tipsy turvy with my meals and drinks since it might slide off the table), and if you're looking for a calming lunch/dinner it's a bit too noisy since it is a sporty atmosphere.

Overall, Primanti defines Pittsburgh all into one sandwich! Such a fun and tasty way of dining with family and friends, or maybe yourself. I wouldn't mind coming back~ black and yellow!"}
{"text":"I came to Primanti Brothers after my roommate said Pittsburgh was known for it.  I read several reviews and went with the pastrami sandwich.  It was good.  Just the right amount of meat (I hate it when the meat overpowers the entire sandwich), yummy vinegary cole slaw that made the sandwich refreshing, tomato, swiss, and of course french fries in the sandwich.  It was a good, ginormous sandwich just not as AMAZING as I thought it would be... If I come back to Pittsburgh I'd probably come back to try a different sandwich."}
{"text":"When I think primanti brothers I think of the original, in the strip district, with years of history behind it. Imagine my surprise when I came across a full fledged restaurant on Steubinville Pike...

I thought ahh, another one to dot this city. But I was amazingly surprised at the full menu. Of course they serve the signature sandwich with the flies and cole slaw, but they also serve a colossal variety of pasta dishes, pizza, steaks, burgers etc. 

Upon finding this place I made the infamous Pittsburgh U-turn and went in for lunch. As a veg, I could have ordered a salad just to enjoy a meal. Talking to the very helpful, and beautiful waitress, Andrea, she suggested a pizza without cheese, loaded with veggies. So I ordered  a small (6 cut) with mushrooms, onions, peppers, and black olives. What a great idea, never thought of that. And it was really good. Excellent pizza crust, chewy, crunchy, and yeasty. Good sauce not too sour or sweet. The vegetable were crisp tender. Basically I was eating an open-faced veggie Stromboli without cheese. Andrea stopped by a few times to refill my lemonade, and asked how I liked her suggestion. I thoroughly enjoyed my veg pizza, I would suggest they get a veg cheese and put it on the menu! Looking around I saw people eating the lasagna which looked huge, someone ordered spaghetti and meatballs, that looked great too. 

It's great to see a Pittsburgh institute grow with the times, and offer great Italian food at good prices."}
{"text":"Okay, a friend came back to the burgh for a long weekend and after much pleading, begging, and finally, paying me off to take her to this popular Pittsburgh heart clogging, frat boy hangout. If you've had one, you've had every sandwich they sell. They all taste the same, maybe if they salted the fries? Anyway I guess I outgrew the taste of these grease balls. A cold Sam Adams was sitting in front of me and suddenly I thought of it, I can eat healthy by getting turkey, no cheese, fries, or mayo. The waiter looked perplexed after asking him if I could just have turkey with onion, slaw, and tomato. Didn't matter, my sandwich came with fries anyway, guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks. I picked the fries off and gave them to my friend, who by the way does not take Zocor. As I stated before in a quick note, this original Primanti's is basically a tourist trap, Oakland college getaway, and food network geek paradise. I'll go to the primanti full service restaurant on the other side of Crafton where they cook a bit healthier and offer lighter fare."}
{"text":"Bf and I were in Pittsburgh for a day before we had to fly back to NYC. I yelped some good places to eat.. and found Primanti.

I ordered the corned beef and cheese sandwich and the bf ordered the roast beef and cheese sandwich. It comes with cole slaw, tomatoes and fries in the sandwich! It is THE most IMPOSSIBLE sandwich to eat but it was damn good!! I was glad that we decided to choose Primanti for lunch. Plus knowing that Anthony Bourdain had tried it, it makes it more well worth trying!

If I ever happen to be in Pittsburgh again, I'd definitely try the cheesesteak or the Capicola sandwich. OOH or the ragin cajun chicken sandwich.. MMMM...."}
{"text":"Awful awful awful awful. It's a damn shame that the steel city's most famous landmark eatery is staffed by people who are too lazy to do their damn job. Was seated at a table and waited for twenty minutes without speaking to anyone from the wait staff. Tried to order from the to go line and was rebuked since we had a table. Moved to the bar to order, waited for the jackass behind the bar to get back to his job when a commercial came on (sorry to pull you away from the chiefs game). The sandwich was mediocre at best, just a gimmick of putting soggy fries on a run of the mill deli sandwich. If anyone is looking to open a legitimately remarkable sandwich joint, Pittsburgh is prime realty."}
{"text":"The food was decent but we spent an hour in there, mostly waiting. it took us only like 10 minutes to actually eat. We didn't see our waitress for about 20 minutes even though she was going to bring us drinks back. Also, the bathroom didn't have toilet paper. I'm glad I bring kleenex with me wherever I go."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Sadly, the service was pretty slow. We were a party of six, so I totally understand that it might not be instant, but many parties came and left before we got our food. The staff was wonderful, but perhaps a note to the management: hire more people for the Saturday lunch hour? 

That aside, amazing! Great sandwiches, great fries. Yum!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, though not spectacular.
The service was friendly though not ecstatic nor enthusiastic.
The atmosphere was exactly what you would expect from a deli like this."}
{"text":"I feel like Primanti Brothers gets quite the polarizing perception around the 'Burgh.  Either people love it or hate it, and I can see why.  When I first moved to Pittsburgh 5 years ago, I found Primanti's to be quite the novelty.  I heard about it from food shows, and I think that novelty value made the flavor seem that much better.  In fact, if I would have rated Primanti's the first week I lived in Pittsburgh it would definitely have been a 5 star rating.

The reality is this for me.  The food is good.  It's not amazing, it's not bad.  At the city locations, including the original one in the Strip, the menu is quite limited. Sandwiches, fries, chili, drinks.  The suburban locations have a vastly expanded menu, and I highly recommend the fried pickles, but since we are talking about the Strip location, I will stop there.  Since the sandwiches are their staple, and they have a large selection of different kinds, let's break one down:

Bread: Thick cut Italian bread.  It's tasty, but be forewarned that the bottom piece may get mushy, or just fall apart.

Tomato: Nah... I don't do these.  You are on your own.

Cheese: Run of the mill provolone? Can't really taste it amongst all the other flavors.

Slaw:  If you are an out of towner (aht of tahner), don't enter Primanti's expecting a mayonnaise based slaw.  This is a vinegar based slaw.  This caught me off guard on my first visit. Once you are over that shock, it's quite tasty.

Fries: Nothing special. Sometimes I wish they were a bit more crispy, but once you start digging into the sandwich, expect them to become a large mashed ball of starch.

Meat:  I can't grade all the meats, as I haven't had them, but personally I recommend the capicola.  It always is good, and has a nice little spice to it.  I do not recommend the Pitts-burger.  Despite it being their top selling sandwich, I found the meat to have very little flavor.

Bonus: Add an egg... it takes the whole sandwich up another notch.

Bottom line, if you come to Pittsburgh, you have to try it at least once.  If you move here, you may choose to eat it more than that.  I don't understand the hate for the place, but I also would never put it in my top 10 list of Pittsburgh restaurants.  Also, I love the history and grit at the Strip location.  It's open 24 hours, so for an extra people-watching treat, stop in some night after the bars close.  It's always entertaining."}
{"text":"Had to try the sandwich with fries and slaw that John Madden used to feature during Steelers home games. I had the Pitts-burger for authentic taste of Pittsburgh. It was good but meat is more like meatloaf or meatball patty. I would probably try it with different meat if I had it do again"}
{"text":"Although this place has been hyped for its 'fries in the sandwich' concept, I do not enjoy it any more than five guys. They were out of chicken the last two times I went to this place. I have stopped going there since then."}
{"text":"Omg the BEST SANDWICH EVER!   I truly enjoyed my sandwich.  I had the pastrami!  All I can say is WOW!  I wish we had one in Los Angeles.  I have food allergies and it was easy to order here :).  We sat at the counter and watched the making of the sandwiches.  What a fun show, not really a show but it was a lot of fun watching employees.  It was very crowded because it was after the steeler opening game.  We stood in line for about 30 minutes.  So worth it :). The staff was very professional but interactive with customers.  Sandwiches came out very quick.  What s combination. Coleslaw and French fries on a sandwich.  This place came highly recommended from locals and people on our flight.  So glad we went. Will defined go back next time in area"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros sells sandwiches. Only, calling these sandwiches doesn't really do them justice. And I think there may have been salads and some other stuf fon the menu... but really, it's all about the almost famous sandwiches!!

The sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw (vinegar based not mayo based!!). No, not on the side, but on the sandwich. And as weird as it may sounds, it tastes really good that way! 

I didn't get anything to wild, just a turkey sandwich. The bread was fantastic, soft but still sturdy, and there was plenty of turkey. The fries could have been crispier, but they weren't limp and soggy so I can't complain too much there! My husband had a bowl of soup in addition to his sandwich and I stole a taste... Very flavorful! 

Service is where a star is lost... We had to flag someone down to get my water refilled and my mother-in-law had to ask for tartar sauce for her fish sandwich twice. Our waiter was friendly and took decent care of us other then those 2 minor hiccups. 

I can definitely see why these sandwiches have the following that they do. I can see myself going back next time my travels take me to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Quite the Pittsburgh experience.  I had been years ago when I went to college in the area; this past weekend, I was in town with my parents and wife, so we went back.  We had to wait in a bit of a line for the original location (since 1933!) but the manager (owner?) was fair and kept things moving.  He had a good sense of humor and smaller parties (2-3 people) were able to be sat more quickly.  Once inside, service was good (no complaints).  Portions are good; food was tasty.  They serve the sandwiches on wax paper; so minimalist; quick to clean up, no dishes, not much waste.  I love the soft, white Italian bread used to make the sandwich.  My only complaint, if you will, is that my sandwich could have used a little more meat on it (they give you an option to double the meat; oh, and I did get an egg on mine as well).  The fries were good (hand-cut, and pretty thick).  Remember, cash only.  Also, parking in the area is tough, but we totally lucked out and got a spot right by Primanti Brothers that is reserved for customers and was free!  We walked around the strip a little after lunch... is a very fun area (we were there on a Saturday around lunch time).  With two beers, four sandwiches, and an order of cheese-fries, our total (with tip) came to $43... not too shabby for lunch out for four adults."}
{"text":"This is a place you go to when you want to watch a game or you have an out of town guest, not something you go solely for the food, which is the same as any other sports bar's food. Personally i am not a big fan of the sandwiches (the different components just don't go together), but obviously it's something you need to try once if you're in Pittsburgh. Everything else is pretty average. They do have a good beer and drink selection though, and it's a fun place to go for games, so I'm giving it 4 stars based mainly on that"}
{"text":"So here I go. First of all when you travel to a new place and everyone tells you that you have to go to ...  you know you have high expectations. You kind of don't want to try it. Because after all what if it sucks. I know places that people say are great and I don't like them. 
Let me tell you that Primanti Bros is the real deal. For real!!!  That sandwich is more than big enough and packed with flavor. I had the spicy Italian with a fried egg!  Woo!   Man oh man!!!  It was an event. 
Watched some college football had a great sandwich and hung out with my brother. It was a great night. 
If you come to Pittsburgh you got to try it. Glad I came."}
{"text":"Cheap greasy and delicious.  The original.  Sit at the counter on the right side (as you walk in the door) and you will have what I would consider to be a long-time old-school Pittsburgh experience.  I have nothing bad to say about this Primanti's location, and anytime I'm entertaining a first-timer in Pittsburgh, it's a staple on the list of places to go."}
{"text":"A classic Pittsburgh experience.  Fries on sammiches.  Delicious, unhealthy, enjoyable.  The downtown location is hands-down the best place to go, but the Moon location is pretty good."}
{"text":"The waitress disappeared for over 20 minutes and my food was cold when it finally arrived.  The wings were not good. They charge for extra sauce but then barely put any sauce on the wings. 

The first table they sent us to was not clean and and when I said something about it they said \"okay just sit anywhere.\"  The chicken tasted old and the cheese on the salad tasted worst than government cheese.  

The food was HORRIBLE!  I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Even at the risk of a heart attack, I'm going to continue to frequent Primanti's. How unfair that they've opened a location just minutes from my home in the South Hills. Dammit Toni, have you no concern for my health? At least when you were only on the Strip, I had to work hard to get there.

That said, in all seriousness, the food is monster good (hot pastrami sandwich--yummy), cup of chili, and a flagon of Primanti's number 1 best seller. Best, and I mean best, onion rings in the tri-state -- even better than Eat 'n Park. Folks come in from out of town, and we do lunch at Primanti's. Put's them in a food coma every time :) 

Servers and greeters are genuinely sweet gals, and that's important to an old man like me. As Arnold said in the Terminator---\"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Wins are always subpar , online orders always take 2-3 times estimated time. Wouldn't even go here if it wasn't a quarter mile from my house."}
{"text":"Enjoyed 1/2 off happy hour beers and the angus beef, cheese, cole slaw and fries sandwich. Too big to truly enjoy with my hands, used fork instead.  Very tasty, though next time I would ask for the fries on the side. As the fries were a bit soggy in the sandwich."}
{"text":"Needs an update. I'm sure 20 years ago this place was the bees knees, but people's tastes have changed a bit.

If there was a 'New-mantis' with better ingredients I would be all over it."}
{"text":"The only Primanti's you should ever go to is the strip district location. This one is just as awful as the other suburban excuses for restaurants. They really are terrible. The wait staff is weak. Forgetting orders, bringing the wrong orders, not offering specials/promos etc...  I ordered wings extra crispy, well done.. Or however you want to describe it. I made sure I was vividly clear how they had to be done. They weren't. They were soggy and horrendous. And captain Morgan?  Don't get your hopes up on drinking that cause they ran out. HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF CAPTAIN MORGAN?!?!?  Bar manager is as incompetent as their wait staff. Do yourself a favor and skip this location."}
{"text":"What what!!!!! You can't go wrong but my fav is the Kielbasi with an egg. It's my first stop in the Burgh, my last before hitting the road, and as many times as I can in between. 

Plus ask for one packed up togo and enjoy when you get back home. I think they call it \"neat\" when they wrap everything separate. NOM NOM NOM!!!!"}
{"text":"When I think of a good sandwich & Pittsburgh, I think no further than Primanti Brothers. 

We made the trek over to Oakland time & time again... was never disappointed in the various sandwiches, fries &/or slaw. Still try to visit whenever I'm back in the 'burgh over 25 years after initially discovering the place. That says something.

Though, clearly it's not for everyone, there's a healthy balance between fawning & personal disdain.... the later of which I believe is overblown for this particular location based on the ratings for it so far."}
{"text":"So I did come back, and this time I ordered the Pittsburger like I said I would. I did enjoy it way better than the pastrami I had last time. I also dined in this time as well instead of taking it back to the hotel. It definitely taste much better when you dine in. The sandwich isn't all smushed and everything is nice and hot. The fries on the sandwich tasted fresh and were very delicious. I still think the Cole slaw overpowers the sandwich but not to the point where you can't eat it. Overall a very delicious sandwich that I wouldn't hesitate to order again. The guys were all cool and welcoming. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm working on Pittsburgh Strip District reviews from my latest trip to the city last Tuesday, and by now it's no secret that businesses on The Strip are near and dear to my heart.  Primanti Brothers is no exception.

You may or may not know what Primanti sandwiches are all about--large inexpensive sandwiches composed of thick slices of soft French bread, some sort of meat and/or cheese, Italian coleslaw, and fries.  A liquidity factor on sandwiches is really important to me, and for this reason Primanti Brothers gets 4 stars rather than 5 stars; about half the time I visit I find that the coleslaw isn't quite wet enough for my taste.  Sure, I could slather some Heinz all over my sandwich, but then the sandwich flavors would be lost in exchange for the flavor of ketchup.  

I've tried several different sandwiches over the years and have enjoyed them all.  They've got a ton of personality...well, as much personality as a sandwich can have!  If it's your 1st time visiting Primanti Brothers, then don't be shy about asking a server for his/her recommendations; they tend to be more than happy to provide their input.

The dirty old bathrooms are located down a steep flight of stairs on the dining area side that has the bar, but, you know, it just wouldn't seem right for Primanti Brothers to have shiny new bathrooms; the place is basically a dive.

Yum.  Primanti sandwiches are, in a word, satisfying!"}
{"text":"Been to Pittsburgh many, many times in the past, but have.......ready for this.........never been to Primanti Brothers.  Ever.  Any of them.  Even the Heinz Field location!  I know...I'm ashamed.  Anyway, went there twice on our most recent visit to the 'Burgh.  We ate dinner one night, and just a couple of nightcap drafts the following night.  The place was everything that I expected; decent food, cold beer, clean and staffed by friendly, helpful wait persons.  Had the pizza, some wings (garlic parmesan...yum!) and some beers.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a conference and was told by so many people to visit this restaurant and try their \"unique\" sandwiches, a Pittsburgh classic. I had the corned beef. Two in my party had the steak, one had turkey and the fifth had a salad. The bread was fresh and soft and very enjoyable on the sandwich. The rest was \"blah\". If you like cole slaw with vinegar instead of mayo, you may like the sandwich better than I.  The fries on the sandwich added no additional flavor. I've had much better sandwiches than this and all five of us left the restaurant wondering what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"The best! The pizza and classic sandwiches are the best. If you live in south hills, follow this advice...make this one of your usuals and you'll never be disappointed. Round out you list with Doridos, Galis, Pan Asia, and Big Jim's and you'll never need to try a new place!"}
{"text":"The world famous Pimanti brothers,  featured on man vs food. Supposed to be the best in PA.
I went to the monroeville branch.
I had the pastrami and cheese.
I really liked it.
The personal pizza, not so much.
Id come back ."}
{"text":"It's a sandwich.  A huge sandwich with fries and coleslaw on it.  

Primanti's is one of those places people love or love to hate, but I'm just ok with it--I don't really think it's fair for me to give a bad review, since I'm not a big meat eater and only get the cheese.

I find myself eating here once a week or so during the school year, and when I do, I don't have to eat another meal that day.  So...if you're hungry, in Oakland, and haven't stopped here I would recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"No trip to Pittsburgh is complete without a stop at Primanti Bros.  Hugh sandwiches made with fresh bread, your choice of meat, coleslaw and french fries (yes! on the sandwich!).  It was a solid meal an recommended if you are seeking something a little different.  This location is open 24/7 and offers breakfast too."}
{"text":"Delicious food. If you're from Pittsburgh, you have to eat here. Every time we have gone, the food has been wonderful, the service has been good, and we haven't had to wait. Love it."}
{"text":"Primanti's boasts gigantic sandwiches, topped with fries and cole slaw.  The sandwiches were definitely big enough to share, and they had a pretty good variety.  The Market Square location was very crowded on a Saturday afternoon.  We waited in line about 10 minutes to place our order, and another 25 to get our to-go sandwiches.  No one in our party had their preferences honored (no fries, cole slaw on the side, etc.)  We were a little disappointed in the service.  I had heard praises of the fresh bread, but didn't think it was anything special; by the time we got our sandwiches, it was soggy.

There was nowhere to sit, but we were fortunately able to find a table out in Market Square, which was probably better anyway because it was less crowded hectic.

As a Cleveland native, growing up with the similar restaurant, Panini's, I was excited to try Pittsburgh's version.  I was sadly disappointed.  The fries were unseasoned, and the cole slaw wasn't your typical mayonnaise base.  It was a perfectly find sandwich, just not all it was hyped up to be."}
{"text":"My husband was quite excited to eat here.  We saw a Man vs Food episode about this restaurant ages ago, and he has been excited ever since.  Having never been here before, we didn't' know what to expect.  We walked in, weren't greeted by anyone, although seen by several employees... once we saw, what we thought to be regulars, push passed us and seat themselves, we sat ourselves.  It was about 5 minutes before we had a waiter come to our table.  He was quite standoffish, and most unhelpful.  We ordered our meals, and waited with great expectation...  my husband really like his sandwich.  I, however, thought mine was the worst thing I had ever tasted.  It was supposed to be sirloin - it wasn't anything I had every tasted before; the fries were soggy, and I didn't enjoy the coleslaw either.
I would not dine here ever again."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich on Earth.
I'd rather eat a dead whore.
Please...never come here."}
{"text":"Only good AFTER YOU go to the bar. Sober it sucks. Drunk it's great"}
{"text":"If you want a cheap filling meal this is the place. That's the good. My wife and I got in relatively quick bypassing a long line of larger parties due to a table for two opening up. However, when we got in, it was not quick. Three large parties came in after us and was served first, one even noticed this and pointed it out to waitress and she didn't seem to care. Fries on sandwich were not fresh, even cold. Meat was skimpy and under seasoned. If it's not busy and you want a cheap meal, it's ok. DO NOT wait if it's busy, you'll probably be disappointed."}
{"text":"Prior to coming to Pittsburgh for a three-week stay, I asked my friends and acquaintances what things I needed to do while I was here, and one of them enthusiastically recommended Primanti Bros. 

I'm actually not a big sandwich person, so I wasn't expecting to eat at one of these but when I stumbled across the Market Square location, poked my head through the door, and saw a black bean burger on the menu, I quickly found myself a table on the patio. (The music--popular alternative from the past few years--was also a big draw.)

If this happens to be the first review of this place that you're reading, you should know that they put french fries, coleslaw, and (I think) tomatoes on all of this sandwiches. Yes, you read that right--french fries ON the sandwich. I'm not a coleslaw or tomato person, so I ordered my burger with fries only. (I wanted to add lettuce, but they don't have lettuce.)

Absolutely delicious! Both the burger and the fries were wonderful together and individually. 

I might just have to go again one more time before I leave PGH, but I might try a different location. I'm not a fan of the fact that the Market Square location only uses disposable cups, etc., because I don't like unnecessary waste. I did, however, peruse through the #primantibros hashtag on Instagram and saw a picture that had a reusable cup in it, so it seems as though not all locations have the same setup. 

Last but not least, the wait staff was very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Had the pastrami with cheese..very good. Unique taste. Also had the Smallman Street fries also very good! fast service."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in while visiting from Florida. She was hesitant when I told her about the place that I had seen on the Food Network that featured sandwiches with french fries. She said it sounded like \"fair food\". Skip ahead, she loved it! We both did! 

We headed in for an early dinner and were basically alone at the restaurant aside from a couple guys at the bar. We both ordered a sandwich, I had the turkey and she had the roast beef. Both came with fresh french fries and coleslaw piled on top. The bread was delicious as was the entire sandwich. We had a great time, had great service, and loved the food. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location a few weeks back to watch the national championship game. It was chill and relaxed atmosphere as there  wasn't many people there. The food was alright. I'm not a fan of the sandwiches just too much going on their but the chilli  was really good.  Also the bartender was friendly and checked on us often enough. I'd go back to this  locale."}
{"text":"OMG, whatever. I know this is a cliche for Pittsburghers or whatever, but it's soooo good. I'm not originally from Pittsburgh and this is the first place I was taken and it's the first place I take all my out of town friends when they visit. The one closest to downtown let us stay past close one night and were extremely friendly to our rowdiness. Love this place and I'll always go here!"}
{"text":"I was in area to visit friend,  and was trying to get the full Pittsburgh experience by trying one of these locations. 

The atmosphere was nice, table was a little dirty. Server was pleasant and attentive. 

Biggest complaint was my sandwich, I ordered the Pitts-burger, reasonable price and looked really good. I had to add a lot of ketchup it was fairly dry, was hoping the coleslaw had more dressing, between the fries, bread and meat was dry. Plus the burger meat had to be SUPER cheap, there was so much grissle in it, had to keep spitting it out and it had no flavor. 

Will still possibly go back maybe try something else."}
{"text":"My first time to Pittsburgh, and I came here by recommendation from a friend of mine who is a local here. 

First of all, i'm not a fan of sandwiches... but Primanti Brothers definitely opened my eye on how creative and \"big\" the sandwiches can be. 

This reminds me of the \"in and out\" of california... something unique to the area, yet tasteful. You have to try if you're visiting PIttsburgh like myself!"}
{"text":"How are there only 5 reviews?  As I understand it, it's a Pittsburgh institution, and who doesn't love french fries on top of a huge sandwich?
This particular location, right on Market Square, has great, picturesque dining (though the seat yourself policy is a little difficult, as it's hard to tell who's been waiting for a table and encourages you to hover over other diners to snag an elusive seat on a weekend night).  I loved my bologna sandwich, you can't beat the prices for a place that's loved by locals and demanded by tourists, and I'd be sure to stop back (at any location) when I'm back in the Steel City."}
{"text":"It's been years since I have eaten here but we had friends visiting and it seemed like the thing to do in Pittsburgh after visiting all the sites.   Market Square was bustling with vendors everywhere and we got a seat on the patio which was good because inside is crazy loud.  Service was quick and our drinks came out in a timely manner.   I ordered the Pitsburger and Cheese, which is a spicy burger on fresh Italian bread, with the fries, coleslaw and tomato on top.    The bread was super fresh and the sandwich so thick it was hard for me to take a complete bite.    The meat was a bit spicy for me,  but the overall flavor was good.    Others in my group got the roast beef and the pastrami, and being it was their first time here I was anxious to hear their reaction because when I explained the sandwiches, they didn't think it sounded appealing.   Fortunately they both liked their sandwiches and were happy to have indulged in a Pittsburgh tradition."}
{"text":"the sandwiches were good.  enough to hold us over through a game at heinz field.  definitely felt like their were a lot of local people at the time."}
{"text":"My wife went to Pitt for undergraduate studies, so we decided to go visit Pittsburgh and catch the 2014 - AFC North title game between the Steelers and Bengals.  I wanted to eat at all the famous/iconic Pittsburgh restaurants and that of course ultimately led me to Primanti Brothers.

I ordered the burger sandwich, which they advertised as the #2 best selling sandwich.  It kind of left me wondering what was the #1 best selling since that wasn't posted.  Anyhow, it was a great sandwich.  Loved the Cole slaw and the fries mixed in with the meat.  However, the sandwich is very dry and needs a sauce or ketchup to kind of balance things out. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend stopping through if you are ever in town just to try it out."}
{"text":"What a shame- this place has been heading a downhill track for 20 years.  I grew up on the sandwich- so I have been eating ham 
egg and cheese at Pramanti's  in the strip for over 40 years.  When I was a kid we would stay up late and go a midnight when they opened and they only had one location.  When they expanded to Oakland and other remote spots the place changed- but they still were good eats- then they sold and it has been a downhill trip.  The sandwichs are no longer unique but copied all over even at Eat n Park- the bread - the size - the love and care the quality of the slaw and the meats are all gone- now it is stadium food and it should be no surprise that you can buy them at PNC Park.  What really makes me mad is that is the official food of Pittsburgh and it is not very good.  Boo Hoo.  It also shocks me how loyal the city is to a long gone past.  Try something new or hope someone at Pramanti's will fix the failed sandwichs."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Staples for $1000. 

P-Bro's, as I like to call it, is always reliable with their food. This location is nothing different. Food, super fast, and always good. 

Service last night was pretty good. The waitress greeted us almost as all as we sat down, and got our drink order quickly. My Polish Hill special, and Matt's fish sandwich were there in a jiffy. Our server was back shortly to check up. Everything was great. I like the new Polish Hill sandwich. Its Kielbasa, cooked slaw, and pierogis. It came with a beer mustard concoction, that was not to either of our liking. Fortunately, our server had asked me if I wanted it on the side, and I'm so glad she did. It was just weird. 

Great place! 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Dear Primanti Bros.,

I honestly can say as a life long patron, I now absolutely hate the corporate fuck hole you've become. I've waited a week to post this just to make sure I actually felt the same way. 

Firstly, and I won't dive too far in to this end of the story, trying to excuse a manager placing his hands on an employee in any way as a \"management style\" is absolutely ridiculous. I have half a mind some days to return to that location and use my \"management style.\"

Following this incident I still tried going to Primanti Bros to enjoy a Penguins game. Ya know, because, Permannys has good game specials and is a great place to watch the game. Negative. The SOUTHSIDE, yes SOUTHSIDE location was empty. It was weird to me that there was no one there. I've watched many games there before and it was never empty. Soon after speaking to the bartender/server (who never told us her name, even when I asked she just walked away, so I'll just call her the hideously mannered strawberry blond) I completely understood. I asked the beer special, she didn't know, I asked if the Penguins game could be put on, she didn't know, I asked for spicy mustard with my sandwich, she assured me you didn't serve spicy mustard but then came out with it and made sure she threw it on the table to let me know she felt like an idiot. 

Man it was such a pleasant experience. I can't wait to go back! Or I'll just go to an Applebee's or Buffalo Wild Wings for the same, typical bullshit, corporate environment. It was one thing to expand to the suburbs and create the big restaurant but why would you turn the \"legacy\" stores into these spit shined shit shows? So with that, thank you Primantis for absolutely ruining a part of Pittsburgh, neigh, a part of my life and becoming the same \"sports bar\" in every mall shopping center. Next time I can at least go to a TGI Fridays and know that the Pens game will be on at the bar."}
{"text":"We are visiting from FL and my boyfriends step father told us we have to go to this place as for he lived here for many years. We've been here since last Tuesday and we were saving Primanti bros best for last! It was definitely a 10/10 recommend. If I could rate it 10 stars, I would! We ordered the fried mozz bites and they had a wing special 59 cent boneless wings for an app. Wow they were so, so good. They are known for their sandwiches but even their wings were good. The prices are very good. The food amount that you're getting is ridiculous. (In a good way!) I haven't mentioned it, but our server was Matt. He was very attentive but not in an annoying way. I'm a server too, so I thought he did a job well done. He recommended his favorites, told us about the specials. And knew how to hold a convo. Thank you, Matt! Made our first visit very well and one to remember. We're staying right next door at the La Quinta inn. So it's in perfect walking distance to walk off all the food we ate! GO AND EAT THERE! :D"}
{"text":"I had \"Pittsburgh\",its second best seller(Guest what is its first best seller: BEER!). It is interesting that it has fries and colw slaw inside the huge sandwich. It is hard to finish that in one stand. It tastes good and it is a good choice for a quick lunch/dinner. But it doesn't worth it if need to take the bus for a long time and come here for the food."}
{"text":"Amazing....I loved this place...recommend to everyone...I had the Pitts Burger amazing!!!! Would definitely come back here..."}
{"text":"Having heard of this place, the sandwiches really delivered. We tried the capicola and the corned beef which were outstanding! That being said, the service was pitiful. Almost like they were striving to be unpleasant. If that was the case, everyone certainly delivered. We weren't even there during a busy time (3pm). Can't imagine the attitude during a lunch rush hour... in my opinion they should simply have an ordering window, open seating, and a to-go pick up window. The service, or lack thereof, is a waste of time, energy, and money"}
{"text":"Cool to try local Pittsburgh flavor. The walls were painted with Pittsburgh sports heroes.  Just not for me not a fan of Cole slaw."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for famous food. If someone says you have to try a famous restaurant when I go to a new city, I must try that restaurant. I am all about new experiences, especially when it comes to food.

So, when I made my first trip to Pittsburgh, I knew I must try Primanti Brothers. It was so packed during my one-night, two-day stay that I wasn't able to snag a sandwich. However, I was back just a few months later and made it! We tried going on a Thursday night, and it was packed, so we opted to come back on Friday around 1 p.m., hopefully beating the lunch rush. 

Would definitely recommend trying this location at an off-time. Loved the decor and atmosphere. I love the area as well. I opted for the sweet sausage sandwich and it was tasty. Who doesn't love a sandwich with french fries on it? My only complaint about the meal is that the bread was a little soggy. Not sure if it was because of the sausage or if that's just what happens with their bread -- but that was a bit of a turn-off for me. 

I would definitely recommend it (at least once!) for anyone visiting Pittsburgh. I'll be back at least once more to give it another go!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Primanti's location in the area.  Service there last night was atrocious.Ordered my sandwich without coleslaw and it came out with coleslaw.  I mentioned this to the waitress and she asked me if I was allergic to it?  Why is that any of her business?  I sent it back and another one came out.  Very inattentive waitress and I got the vibe that she didn't want to be working on a Saturday night.  I generally have bad experiences at this location.  The suburban location are much better and friendlier."}
{"text":"I love primanti's but this local is less consistent than the strip. Need more fries on sandwiches. Generally packed during lunch."}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh food that can't be duplicated by imitators. Bar seating and hightop tables. Fast service. Draft beer was not as cold as it should be, order bottles. Crappy music."}
{"text":"Original and a really great experience.  Others reviewers... Dry and tasteless?  Really?   This isn't the best sandwich I've ever had but it's original and tasty.  Friendly, fast service.  This is a must visit if for no other reason than its iconic.  You won't be disappointed unless you're affected."}
{"text":"Wow, people obviously don't understand Primanti's...

I went to college in Pittsburgh, and I think I speak for most students in the Oakland area when I say that Primanti's is a vital part of our memories/experience there. Personally I still get cravings for a steak and cheese (no slaw, thanks).

Bottom line: Primanti's is one of a kind, and I guess Yelpers either love it or they hate it. I for one LOVE IT."}
{"text":"It is what it is, and what it was today was fine. I don't like fries on my sandwich, so I order them on the side. I got double capicola w/cheese. Just right. The service is nice, too. Left a 20% tip."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why people love this place so much. I appreciate that it's a nod to the history of Pittsburgh but it truly does the 'Burgh a disservice by being so flavorless. Add some seasoning or dressings or something to the sandwiches, please! I added one star back because the restaurants are an okay place to go for beer and a good vibe."}
{"text":"My Order: Pitts-Burger (ok) & Raspberry Lemon Tea (not bad; sweet) 

Pros: 
- notably, PB was called \"the place\" to go to in Pittsburg
- they put fries & coleslaw into their burgers (novelty idea) due to the history of Pittsburgh (and the working class men) 
- customize-able: you can put eggs, extra meat, etc. in your sandwich
- I sat on the second floor and was able to overlook the first floor & the open-designed kitchen (which was pretty neat) 

Cons:
- to be honest, I didn't think it was anything special. Just fries & coleslaw added into the burger as opposed to being a side
- no parking... 

Nonetheless, it's something worth trying if you're new to Pittsburgh. But would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I feel silly even having to review Primanti Brothers.  Come on - this legendary landmark (even though it has several locations, each are a landmark in my opinion) speaks for itself.  

I almost always order the Capicola and cheese.  If I've had a few drinks, and it is past midnight and I find my way to Primanti Brothers I usually will order it with an egg on it.  But the older I get I find myself there at much more reasonable times!

They claim that they are \"Almost Famous\".  I'm here to say that Primanti Brothers IS FAMOUS.  I mean, come on, Sophia Vegara just tweeted a photo of her Primanti's sandwich to her million + followers.  Primanti's has been on the Food Network God knows how many times.  Drop the \"Almost\", Primanti's, because you Are Famous.

The original location is in the Strip District but you can find one almost everywhere now.  Oakland and the South Side are probably closest to the \"authentic Primanti's\" atmosphere other than the original location, while the newer franchised Primanti's in locations like Monroeville or Harmar are much more of a restaurant type experience.  I like my floors greasy and my sandwich with fries and slaw."}
{"text":"I'm always a little hesitant to try different locations of restaurants, like Primanti's, when they aren't located in a traditional setting.  For example, it only feels like a real Primanti Bros. if it is in the Strip District, South Side, or Oakland.  But the food does not lack the originality that comes with the more nontraditional location, like this one at the Waterfront.  All the great sandwiches are there and made with the same love.  The fries are still on the sandwich.  So don't panic, it is ok to come here and have an authentic Primanti Brothers experience!

I decided to have a steak salad and it was probably one of the best steak salads I've had in the past ten years (I only eat their sandwiches after midnight and when I've been drinking).  

I also had a Bloody Mary that on a scale from 1 to 5 was probably a 3.  

Service was good and the place is clean, designed with a open layout and bonus - you can park for free."}
{"text":"Loved it loved it loved it here. It is exactly or even better that advertised. I had the kielbasa sandwich plate with a good local beer. Just delicious. The ambiance is fun with the original artwork painted directly on the walls. The people here have that wonderful Pittsburgh hospitality / genuinely nice and welcoming. The music is nice - perfect setting for The Bruce sound. TVs display sports while you eat. Beer selection is great and on full display for you to select your favorite. Hey - try something new - the locally made beer I had was excellent. Reasonable prices too. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I found myself in Pittsburgh one Sunday morning while pursuing the baseball parks of America, and a little bit of preemptive research made it unavoidable to visit Pittsburgh and NOT have a Primanti Bros. sandwich.

When I arrived into the city, I parked my car and made my way to Market Square location, where I was told that it was also where a few scenes of She's Out of My League was filmed, (which by the way, I enjoyed that movie since it so closely hit home to a dork like me), but upon arrival, I was mortified to see nothing but construction equipment and chain link fences.

But anyway, I go into Primanti's, and I'm bombarded by Pittsburgh sports - this does not bother me, but the sheer magnitude was a bit unexpected.  The wall of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal favorite, the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing to be considered one of the greatest plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  The rest of the establishment is clean and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.

So being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of \"what is THE food for a tourist like me?\"  With a confident smirk, she simply says \"pastrami,\" and I thank her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much \"a suggestion\" as it was \"the order,\" and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well - you guys know the drill.

So in conclusion, great success.  I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, and just thinking about it has me kind of craving one again, even after lunch.  In fact, the best part of this particular trip to Pittsburgh was Primanti Bros., because my Braves ended up sending out the D-team, who naturally failed to beat a mediocre Pirates squad.  But the food was good, and that's what's the most important."}
{"text":"My family lives in this area so I visit fairly frequently. I'm always up for a new place to try. I agree with the person who said that the food network hyped this one up big time. Were the sandwiches good? Yes. Were they OUTSTANDING? No. Were they so big I coudln't finish and didn't want anything else? No. Decent pricing. Service was ok but left a bit to be desired. I may go here to watch a sports event, but there are other places in the area to try and it just didn't give me that, \"I gotta go back here next time I'm in town\" feel. Try it once, you might like it."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for the 4th of July weekend to check out their fireworks and I visited the Market Sq. location on the 4th, place wasn't really packed when I arrived. I needed to feed myself, my wife and my two kids. I ordered a hot sausage and cheese for myself, a black angus top sirlion and cheese for the wife and split a order of 6 chicken fingers for the kids (it comes with fries, what a deal!). After I placed my order I waited by the bar and unfortunately it was when the death of Steve Mcnair started to air :-(. The bar quickly filled up after I placed my order. The sandwiches took a little while to prepare and not as quick as I've heard they are. I got my order and in my usual fashion I checked it. No chicken finger and fries....bummer. I go back to the cashier/bartender/cook and asked her for my order who asks the cook where it is and he shrugs like \"I dunno\" so , she grabs some new chicken fingers and tosses them into the fryer so now I have to wait even longer for my food. I was planning to take it to go and eat at my hotel because there was no free parking out front. My hotel is by the airport so I wanted the sandwiches to be fresh as possible so that I can get the full experience. The chicken fingers took even longer to prepare so I am waiting and hoping my food doesn't get cold. Finally, after awhile watching the news my order is ready and I dash out and drive back to my hotel. First let me say the kids INHALED the chicken fingers like I never seen them do before and they have tried chicken fingers everywhere. The fries they didn't care for so much. I ate half my sandwich which was no longer hot and it wasn't bad, my wife didn't really care for hers since the amount of steak was skimpy. We would definitely try Primanti's again just not the ones we got this time and we will eat them at the location so that they are fresh as another complaint my wife had was the ingredients didn't seem fresh. I can cross Primanti's off my list of things to do in the da 'burgh. Now if I can only get over my fear of heights and ride those inclines."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff. A little loud, but that's a sports bar for you! Parking is a bit difficult."}
{"text":"Definitely something people associate with Pittsburgh, but let's be honest, the questionable burger-fry-wonderbread thing is just a waste of 1700 calories.  I've eaten here 3 times (always in Oakland), even though I've been in Pittsburgh my entire life."}
{"text":"Love this place. We are practically regulars. Servers and staff are always so great. My four year old son was popping up and down out of our booth because the line cooks were playing with him - so cute. He even got a little rubber ducky from them! It was so nice of them to give us a second to eat, lol. 

The food has always been on point! Seriously, for the price, it can't be beat! 

Sometimes, the wait can be a little long, but that's not their fault! It's just because it's so great! 

Ps- in the summer, they have outdoor seating, which is awesome, and pet friendly! 

Definitely would recommend this location for sure, especially with so many other options in such a close place! 

Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The legendary Primanti Bros.  I believe I had been to Pittsburgh 10+ times before my first visit.  That being said I'm (a) glad I went (b) ok with it taking that long (c) really enjoyed the roast beef and cheese (d) easily would have paid more than the $7 ticket price (e) definitely need to hit the treadmill tomorrow and (f) thankful to not live next door.

Overall, a good local experience.  No burning desire to hit em up the next time in Pittsburgh, but wouldn't hesitate to recommend.  Great tasting glutinous original sandwiches at decent prices, that's what they are."}
{"text":"This restaurant and the surrounding area (The Strip District) are both Pittsburgh staples. You can't be a Pittsburgh resident without trying this restaurant at least once! Personally, my favorite sandwich is the Corned Beef and Cheese, especially with the Egg added on top.

I only give this restaurant 3 stars for several reasons - the wait time, the seating confusion, and the customer service. Sometimes, particularly during the summer, the wait for a table can be an hour or longer. Another frustration is the seating. There is very poor seating direction, which I feel can slow down the already long line. Finally, the customer service is lacking. I get that it's not fancy, but I've had a couple waitresses at this location who were pretty brusque. When asking for a soda refill, the reaction of the waitress is as if I requested a free meal."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Pittsburgh 2 years ago, I visited the Strip District Primanti Brothers location several times before trying this location in Market Square. I was initially a little skeptical but highly recommend this location over the original!

The sandwiches are just as good, if not better, in Market Square and actually bigger. I attribute this to the mostly male staff here vs. female in the Strip District since they seem to make most of their sandwiches based on \"handfuls.\"

I also enjoy the atmosphere at this location best. Yes, it's still a bit divey, but it's less diner and more bar than the Strip District Primanti. Overall, I recommend this restaurant as a great, inexpensive place to grab a sandwich and beer in Market Square."}
{"text":"Dudez.

I went to school in Pittsburgh and how did I never go here?  After admitting that, I can say that this place is crazy good.  I now live in San Francisco and a couple of schmo's from Pitt came out here and opened up a clone store.  NOWHERE near as good, prices are hella high, but it's SF so what can you expect...everything is stupidly priced.  I don't mind the price but at least get the sandwich down.

Fries and slaw on a sandwich? What? Oh hell yeah it's good.  I love the keilbasa sandwich.  Best of the best in my opinion.  Why else would they have been featured in Esquire?

http://www.esquire.com/features/food-drink/sandwiches

Bring it!"}
{"text":"As an avid Primanti's goer, I can hands down say that this Primanti Bros is the best. This location offers the full menu, not just the sandwiches. The wait staff is friendly, as well as at the top of their games- You won't be struggling to find your waiter/waitress to get a refill, they are always around and checking in. In terms of food, the taste also goes above other locations I've been to. Also, Primanti's new rewards program means a $10 gift card for every $100 spent, and if you go as frequently as my family, it adds up fast! A perfect spot to watch the Pens win the cup again!"}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE!  Walked in and nice guy greeted us right away.  My brother and I sat at the counter and were taken care of by another cool guy who gave us the skinny on what and how to order. The sandwich was fresh and delicious.  I added onions to mine bc I gotta have dem onions.  My only wish is that I wish the slaw was vinegary but it was not BUT still worth coming from NJ for.  a place you just have to try."}
{"text":"Location: Of much debate. The \"Original\" Primanti's is in the Strip District. Known to be a meal on a bun, they used to service workers (train/freight/trucking industry) in the middle of the night with their sandwiches. Sadly all locations are of the same corporate quality control. A Primanti's here will taste the same as in Florida or Michigan, complete with sides that never existed on the original menu.


Facility: To be fair here are a few of my favorite locations:
Oakland: Great for a sandwich and tall beer to kick off a study crunch in the heart of Pitt.
Strip District: A must do after late night clubbing or a good eat post 3a downtown walking distance.
Market Square: Good people watching outside, lively with many tv's with sports audio.
PNC Park: My favorite even without a horse in the race. Combine a Pittsburgher, Yeungling and a seat out of the rain and soak in the beauty of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" skyline.

Food/Drink: At these original locations the menu isn't as chain-esque. You have pickle option, fried foods, egg add on (must do.)
The sandwich is comprised of a processed beef patty, fries (not sure if fresh cut), tomatos (hit or miss on quality), and cole slaw (thick cabbage style also hit or miss on quality)

Drink: The No. 1 best seller. Tall pour, fair prices on beer drafts. Liquor is too expensive and under poured. A shot is 1.5oz no matter what your new ownership commands! 

Service: In these locations these guys rock. They are hard working Pittsburgh folk who stand behind their product, stories of our city and have that friendly tough look that keeps the tourists in line. 

Conclusion: If this is your first time in the city go to Market Square. It's the same experience without the Pittsburgh paraphernalia unless your already exploring the Strip (am must do)"}
{"text":"I love Primanti Bros! This location doesn't have the same vibe as the original location, but the sandwiches are just as good. Come in, enjoy the Fish & Cheese with fries and coleslaw piled mile high, and get a small dose of what Primanti Bros has to offer. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"What can one say? 
Great sandwich (corned beef) and a cold beer for lunch...tough to leave this place. 
Although not great....it's one of those places that you have to go to when you visit Pittsburgh...you won't be disappointed...but you won't be blown away either."}
{"text":"So, we were on  a road trip through Pittsburgh and made a detour especially for this place. I had eaten here before and knew how much of a Pittsburgh instistution this place is. The service staff were friendly but the service itself was satisfactory at best. I was not impressed with my Sandwich (Capicola and cheese); it was OK. My wife enjoyed her turkey sandwich - I tasted it too and found it better than mine. The atmosphere inside is fun with all the pictures and memorabilia but given the expectations and the detour we had to take for it, we were underwhelmed. We wonder why such an established institution that has existed for so long still has a \"cash only\" policy sending it customers scrambling for ATMs...ah well"}
{"text":"In short, my sandwich tasted like the great depression but the service was great.  If you need more info, read on.

Came here after a 5 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich I ever had.  I was served grocery store-quality \"roast beef\" on stale french bread; their Roast Beef sandwich.  No flavor and a serious lack of saltiness.  I can literally make a better tasting sandwich using Oscar Myer lunch meat and table condiments than what I tasted in your roast beef sandwich.  The sandwich sucked; no flavor, no excitement.  We had to add ketchup, salt, pepper, and hot sauce to make it anything other than bland.  I have had better food from back-woods gas stations in Louisiana at mid night than what I was served here. 

And the beer menu was mediocre, at best.  No hard hitters, just a couple local beers and generic bullshit.  

On the other hand, the fried pickles were great.  And the wait staff were awesome.  They had some pretty big parties to deal with at really busy times and handled it well.  Wait staff was 9/10 but the food was only good enough for the steel workers of the 1930's who needed to fill their bellies with something for energy.  

I'm not planning to go back to Pittsburgh, but if I do, I'm not going to this place.  It wasn't worth the trip, wasn't worth the money, and the food (at the very finest) was mediocre(and that is being gentle), 

Also, parking was shit.  Enjoy paying an additional $8 2 blocks away for something my kid could have made better in 5 minutes than the 80 minutes we spent there.  

I get it, this place is a local legend, but it's sad when every fast food sandwich I have ever had in my life beat what I got for less money.  I've had better sandwiches at Arby's,

My advice:  Locals must not know shit from their asshole.  There are a lot of other great places around this location, go there.  This place really did suck."}
{"text":"I love the food in Pittsburgh, but Primanti's is obviously living off of a reputation gained and lost years before I made it to this city. It's a sandwich...and there are fries on it. Can anyone give me directions to Big Jim's so I can enjoy a great meal? Thanks."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. My family is on vacation (obviously from out of town) and went to Primanti's because they advertise a 3am closing time online for the station square location. We arrived to Primanti's and immediately upon entering the establishment we were yelled at and degraded because apparently they were closed (although there was no indication of this seeing as they still had plenty of guests inside and outside). The rude man behind the counter was mocking us as he told us the strip district was still open... we do not know what here that is (again, we are on vacation). He very cold and rudely yelled at us to leave and then mocked us as we were walking out. Also, as we were leaving more people were walking in. 

This location has immature, young, rude staff. Not worth trying. Highly recommend everyone to steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"for as much as I have heard about this place (while in CA) i was expecting something on par with unicorn farts.... yeah, no. the bread was good. i hated the fries. the server/ cook was cocky and borderline rude. the coleslaw was just shredded cabbage with vinegar. i don't get what the big deal is. cheap, big sandwich, got the order quickly. but it isn't a culinary masterpiece nor should it be on your tourist list."}
{"text":"Oh Primanti's, I'm just going to lay it out there -- I think your signature sandwich is underwhelming. Sorry Pittsburgh, but I just don't get your obsession with fries and coleslaw on a sandwich. I know, I know...feel free to tar and feather me.  :)

But my feelings about a Primanti's-style sandwich are irrelevant to this review, because this is a suburban Primanti's -- as such, they offer a wider menu that goes beyond just the sandwiches. We happened to be in the area and my husband wanted to catch part of the Pens game, so we decided to stop by.

We were seated in a booth, and it wasn't very comfortable -- they are all wooden with low backs. The low back was particularly annoying because not only could I hear every single word of the conversation from the people in the booth behind us, but the woman sitting there had really long hair that she kept flipping over into my side of the booth. Gross. 

To add to my already-kinda-sour mood due to the hair-flipper sitting behind me, we were ignored for 15 minutes after we were seated. I finally had to walk up to the hostess and ask if we even had a waitress. Finally one appeared (and to her credit, she was very apologetic for ignoring us).

During Pens games (and apparently Wednesday Pirates games too), this Primanti's has a limited menu of snacks/apps that are on special (along with a Miller Lite beer special). Wanting to save money, we opted to share a few things from the special menu -- a slice of cheese pizza, chicken wings, chips and queso, and mozzarella wedges.

The food was mixed. I was surprisingly impressed with the pizza -- it was made with a nice chewy dough, tangy red sauce, and plenty of cheese. The wings were pretty standard-issue chicken wings (nothing notable), although the sauce they were tossed in (honey buffalo) was tasty (an interesting combination of sweet, spicy, and vinegary). The mozzarella wedges were also fairly standard-issue. They were cooked well -- crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, but otherwise pretty average. The biggest letdown was the chips and queso. The word \"queso\" to me implies a creamy blend of cheeses laced with spices. This queso, however, was more like glorified ballpark nacho cheese sauce -- really processed, overly salty, Velveeta-esque. Yuck!

Other than being ignored for the first 15 minutes, the service was decent. Although there was a server (not ours) who nearly wiped out after slipping on a greasy puddle on the floor near our table, and instead of cleaning it up, he just made sure to sidestep it the next time he went by. He's lucky a customer didn't slip like he did and hurt themselves. It seems really lazy and risky to just leave the puddle there, and that bugged me.

So overall, my first foray into the world of suburban Primantis was mediocre at best. I won't be rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's a great Pittsburgh experience! I ran the marathon on Sunday and carb loaded on Friday at PB. It's very unique. I recommend it for visitors and/or late night post bar dinning. I'll be sure to stop by next time I'm in \"The Burgh\"."}
{"text":"I'm an out of towner who is not a fan of coleslaw at all. I thought for sure I'd try it and be \"eh whatever about it\". We went after a Pirates game and it was honestly the best sandwich I've ever had. The coleslaw is not overpowering and adds a great texture with the fries and roast beef. One of my favorites. This will absolutely be a place I stop every time I'm in Pittsburgh to watch a game."}
{"text":"I know I'm being very aggressive with a two star rating. However, when I arrived there was a 15 minute wait was greeted politely. And requested a booth if all possible. Was explained that there is no guarantee and I understand. Once seated me and my significant other were placed in the smallest table top in the place. We were waited on by friendly waiter however the order was messed up from beginning to end. Asked for water with lemon, no lemon. Ordered an item with no tomatoes it came with tomatoes. Ordered a salad with extra shredded cheese and extra ranch. Neither of those came on it. I'm very forgiving and understand mistakes happen. But this was not a super busy night the place was not packed just really awful service. We asked to speak to manager, and we did. After kindly explain to him all that we had experience. He was a younger gentleman who seemed not to even care about our complaints. I would not recommend this place as a friendly enjoyable local restaurant. Perhaps it needs new management and a more caring staff"}
{"text":"When i told everyone I was going to Pittsburgh - Primanti Bros is one place everyone said I should try.

Primanti Bros.'s sandwich = meat + cole slaw + french fries

I ordered the pastrami and it was really good! The pastrami was lean and warm. I'm not a big fan of cole slaw but their cole slaw was pretty good. It was more like pickled vegetable; the pieces were big instead of chopped up finely which i liked. The french fries were a bit of a challenge to keep inside though.

I would recommend trying Primanti's if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The food always fabulous. We always stop on our way out of town to get sandwiches to go & tell them we are traveling, so they pack all the sandwich stuff separate so it doesn't get soggy. We ordered today & told the guy we needed them to be packed for traveling & he looked at me like I had two heads. I explained to him what I need & he say OK. When got my order, the sandwiches were put together. This moron had 4 sandwiches to make & couldn't handle a simple request. We will not return to this local. I'm absolutely fuming. We wasted $17 plus on food that will not be edible after our 3 hr drive home."}
{"text":"First time going...and I LOVED IT! Great service, tasty food, and a \"hometown\" ambiance. I'm not from Pittsburgh, but this place definitely made me feel at home. The portions are huge! My only regret is that I didn't try to split a meal w/ my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I was in town for a convention and we needed a quick lunch spot while we were walking around. My friend, who lives around Pittsburgh, suggested we check out Primantis. I see that it's gotten rave reviews but it honestly just wasn't my thing. The service kinda sucked and given that it was fairly empty I'm not entirely sure why. The sandwiches were okay, and the vinegar based coleslaw were quite interesting. However I found the fries to be rather tasteless which contributed to my lack of enjoyment in the food. Maybe I'll try it again and see if they were having an off day or I just picked the wrong type of sandwich for me."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would like it, but it was amazing! Every sandwich is topped with fries and slaw. I got the Pitts-burger and cheese and my husband got the Capone. Huge sandwiches, so make sure your hungry!"}
{"text":"most overrated restaurant in pittsburgh. they pay lots in advertising and sponsorships! that's all"}
{"text":"At first I didn't like this place. I tried a few sandwiches and liked the Pittsburgh classic idea more than the actual food. I was about to give up when I tried the roast beef. It's my sandwich every time I go now. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm from Pittsburgh, therefore Primanti's holds a special place in my heart. It may not be the best sandwich in the world, but it's definitely high up there with the best. 

However, I don't really want to focus too much on the food aspect in this review - service is the main point. 

We visited on a Friday night around 10:30 and the place had a decent crowd and looked to only have one server. She came to our table and didn't even bother to say \"hi\" - just a \"What do you guys want.\" Thankfully I was a little tipsy from the Pirate game and sort of ignored her lack of customer service. When our food came she was still very rushed and didn't say anything to us. My boyfriend finally had to pin her down after waiting for our check for nearly 15 minutes to pay. She was extremely rude and asked him where the bill was. When he told her we didn't have it yet she said responded by pretty much saying she's not a mind reader and she had no clue what we had. Rude! What the heck is wrong with you? I worked in a restaurant before and have had a full dining room to myself- I know how stressful it can be, however it is never okay to be so blatantly rude to customers. 

I'm giving this location three stars solely on food. My chicken sandwich was great and a great value for how big the sandwich was. I wasn't prepared by how spicy the chicken was going to be, but I was totally cool with it! Me love spicy foods! 

Soooo bottom line, this place was only bearable because I was drunk and hungry. If I was ever craving a Primanti's while sober in the area, I'll get it go to."}
{"text":"I love Primanti's. Over the years the style and flavors haven't changed at all. Oversized portions for a good price! Coleslaw and fries on the sandwich are a trademark of this place. Definitely a must to go to Primanti Bros!"}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich like other locations except a little skimpy. Cool local staple in Pitt. A must try if you are traveling through."}
{"text":"After arriving in Pittsburgh late on a Sunday night, there aren't too many places that are open, let alone a local restaurant.  Although it's located near the warehouses with a lot of trucks running by, it's still a safe place to park your car nearby and grab a bit to eat.

I'm not a big fan of mixing foods all in one, but the sandwiches \"work\" real well.  The cole slaw adds good texture and the vinegar gives it some needed spice.  The french fries add some heat (temperature) and some starchiness.  I ordered the pastrami and cheese so the cheese was melted and the pastrami was good quality.  The bread was soft so I could grab it and stuff a good bite of everything in my mouth.  It's a pretty good value for that time of night and a great way to finish off the night.  Staff was friendly, too."}
{"text":"Apparently this was a must visit when in Pittsburgh. The service was great and the food was hot. Apart from that there wasn't much there to differentiate this from other restaurants serving up greasy food. 

The pastrami sandwich was fine as were the fries and a pretty good bargain for $7 - I wouldn't go back but if your in the mood for a filling sandwich this is your spot."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Heard about it on the Travel Channel and since I was in Pittsburgh for a conference I decided to go. Me and a friend went and we ordered two sandwiches: The Cajun Chicken Brest & Cheese and the Pastrami & Cheese. Both sandwiches came topped with lettuce, tomato, and French fries, that's right I said French fries! Both were cut in half and we tried both sandwiches, and they were amazing! Both our bills were no more then 8 dollars which is real cheap for good food! The staff were friendly and the atmosphere great. I recommended for anyone visiting the Pittsburgh area, it's a must eat!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

It's my first time in Pittsburgh, so I went with the cheesesteak. The sandwich itself was alright, but the service was fast and the food and beers are cheap. You can't really go wrong. 

And as a bonus, we sat outside immediately on an 80deg day. Worth experiencing"}
{"text":"This joint makes excellent sandwiches. 

I ordered the fish sandwich and it was delicious! First off, its huge, and cheap. They stuff the sandwiches with cole slaw and fries (yummy). 

You really can't go wrong here. 

The place is usually packed to the brim, so you need to get in early before it gets full, which it will. Once it gets busy, the service gets worse. 

If you're in the area, its definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"What is there to say that hasn't been said before. Just go and enjoy, everything they make is just delicious!!
Quick tip: Flip your sandwich upside down as you don't want the cole slaw to tough your pallet first. You want the warm delicious pastrami or whatever meat you want to be what you first taste. That makes a huge difference, trust me!!"}
{"text":"The must-try sandwich in Pittsburgh with layers of coleslaw (vinegar-based), fries, meat, cheese, mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes between two huge slices of bread.  Yes, that is all on one sandwich.  It feels like a heart attack in a rectangular package but is simultaneously delicious.  I personally love the Angus black steak but the most popular version is definitely the cheesesteak, which I would guess is Pittsburgh's version of the Philly cheesesteak.  I also like the carved turkey breast version as well, which is a good option for a semi-lighter option.  This location is pretty low-key and akin to a bar but ot's usually packed and its prime location in Market Square makes it a popular lunch spot."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of food that can't be found anywhere else.  This restaurant has such food with their killer sandwiches.  A must like getting deep dish pizza in Chicago."}
{"text":"Fries, coleslaw, meat, and thick italian bread.  These could be a good combination if any one of the ingredients was quality - but they aren't.  Throw in a blaring TV, homeless people at the bar, and a sticky, dirty floor and you have a recipe for miserable meal.

College kids like this spot, but when did they ever know what they were talking about?"}
{"text":"If you visited pitt and didn't try primantis did you really do your trip right?! Primantis is bomb."}
{"text":"Finally after years of having no reason to ever go to Pittsburgh, a reason comes up and I make it to a Primanti Brothers. This location is on the south side on Carson which is a long street loaded with shops, bars etc. Parking was easy with a cheap paid lot almost next door. I had the capicola with cheese which was suggested by the bartender and it was real good. They use a nice thick slice chewy but soft Italian bread, good quality meat and then they pile on a french fries and a crunchy sweet and sour type coleslaw which seems to perfectly compliment the sammich. Reasonable prices and big selection in a menu you read off the wall. Glad I finally made it and was very happy with the quality."}
{"text":"This is the original Primanti Brothers though not my favorite. It is the best one to see a wide variety of Pittsburghers eating lunch. Last time I was there, I sat at the bar surrounded by general contractors and guys in suits. It's a nice bar and a surprisingly large area for eating inside. The sandwiches come quick and cheap as is to be expected. 

The wonder of a Primanti Brothers sandwich hinges on the great white bread, vinegary coleslaw, and hand-cut fries stacked high. 

I recommend the sweet sausage sandwich - though it's definitely one of the messiest."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Primanti Brothers restaurant. The Oakland location is tops for lunch because you can climb to the second half-level and look down at the grill while all the sandwiches are getting slapped together. 

As with all Primanti Brothers restaurants, you will get a great heaping sandwich with slaw and fries served on a delicious falling apart white bread. At this location adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh, you get the added bonus of some good beer specials to help wash down your sandwich."}
{"text":"What can I say about Primanti Bros?!

This is the place that most chefs, restaurant owners, bar owners, management, and servers need to study if they truly want to work and SUCCEED in the restaurant industry.  If you're in doubt...  Try to park - the parking lot is usually overflowing.  But you will still get seated faster than any other place with a line.  

We come here when we are sick of Pittsburgh's (really just South Hills') jackass attitude on customer service and low-brow outlook on food quality.  Primanti Bros relaxes us with ICE COLD BEERS - no matter bottled or tapped, and treats us with BIG sandwiches that are CHEAP but never lacking on quality nor quantity, and provides the absolute premium example of FIVE STAR service worth our time and money in Pittsburgh.  We leave loving Pittsburgh every time (that good!).  GO STEELERS!  GO PIRATES!  GO PENGUINS!  I would go as far as to call Primanti Bros the In-N-Out of Pittsburgh, a must for every visitor.

On one occasion, we went two nights in a row, almost three!!  Heck, I am going to go again this week, because I am craving the experience after another shitty day of smart ass attitude and zero help - this time just trying to get my damn bicycle fixed at a \"Pro\" Bikes.  A week to replace chain, tape, and tires for a 30 minute to 1 day job (if busy).  That would be an equivalent for waiting a week to replace your windshield wipers at a dealership.  Pittsburgh.  South Hills.  Yuck.  But no waiting nor BS servings of poor attitude is to be found at Primanti Bros!!  

Primanti Bros doesn't just have daytime beat.  The bar at night still scores just as high as daytime hours with excellent service and top quality food, past most other \"bars\" kitchen closing times.  The Walnut Grill for example was our first choice - went in and ordered drinks - the chairs were raised onto the tables hours before actual closing time - kitchen closed although the wrap-around bar and a few booths were seated with many parties - we had to go get the server to serve us and go get the server to pay even though it was not busy at all - and then we left, walked back to our house and went to Primanti Bros to actually eat and drink more!! Walnut Grill lost a lot of money on us and will continue to lose money to Primanti Bros because of that lazy, late eat-out night.  Not to mention the food quality is super inconsistent there - how hard is it to make edible nachos and serve them hot every time!!?!  Very hard apparently.

What do I order every time I go to Primanti Bros?  The Pittsburgher, because I can not get enough of it - go for the double to really satisfy your needs to be nurtured by your food.

We have brought guests here and sure they were not happy with an order or two for whatever reason that annoys them, but guess what?  NO ATTITUDE, servers take it with a smile and a new sandwich comes out, and they return with a smile!!  And the guests return to having a great time.  PERFECT. 

You want a sports bar?  YOU GOT IT.  A TV at every angle for you to comfortably watch TV.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that they sell t-shirts like it's Joe's Crab Shack!  I shouldn't have to go to a touristic place to get good, basic food and ice cold beers in Pittsburgh, but I do and really do not mind one bit!  TAKE MY MONEY!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their sammies are awesome. I am not a coleslaw fan but like it and choose to eat it here. The pictures below describe it nicely. It's a sandwhich with coleslaw and french fries on it. It may not sound right but it's excellent. The service isn't the best but it's usually because they are verrrry busy. It's not your healthiest place but hey, who cares."}
{"text":"I hate to diss an icon, but I thought it was bland. And when I'm inhaling food that will eventually result in death, it'd better be damn good.

Flies buzzing around, kinda gross. The servers were really friendly, though."}
{"text":"There is something to be said for simplicity, and this is it.  I've been looking forward to eating at Primanti's for a very long time, and I'm happy to have it crossed off my bucket list.

We waited outside for about 15 minutes before we made our way to the front of the line and got a table.  I have a high level of respect for the \"No BS\" hostess who was just trying to get everyone inside.  Of course, the idiots in front of us showed up with 12 people.  (Aside:  Look.  Don't freaking do that, alright?  You don't go to a place with a line out the door and ask to get 12 people seated.  Split up into smaller groups or something.  You're making life terrible for everyone else.)

And we're back...the sandwich was incredible.  Since every sandwich is identical except for the meat, the service is lightning quick.  From the moment we sat down, we had our food in less than 2 minutes, no exaggeration.  

Of course it was delicious and something I've never had before.  As I said, there is something to be said for doing one thing and doing it well.  I had another at the Pirates game that night!"}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and this place was delicious! The service was quick and efficient. I ordered the roast beef and the only complaint I had was I wished it came on a baguette vs regular sliced bread. Would def return!"}
{"text":"A great Primanti Bros. to go to if you don't want to drive into the city! I absolutely love the atmosphere in this location - it has almost a cabin feel to it. And the best part, there is rarely a wait to sit!

The staff at this location is always super friendly and quick. I actually enjoy the food at this one over other Primanti Bros. locations. I usually just get the bacon & cheese sandwich with an egg.

The only downfall to this location that I want to point out - it is noisy and a little cramped in spots. The last time we were here, we were sat right by the front door, with their arcade golf game right behind us as well as the bathroom. People kept walking past and a group of 5 kids decided to play the arcade game, so it wasn't ideal seating.

Overall, I 100% prefer this location over city ones. No wait, great tasting food, and the staff is quick. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I tried this place twice. Sandwiches are good, but I think they are over-rated. Good price for the value. I like the idea of fast service, no plates, no frills, but we had a bad experience with a server that used her hands to put back a slice of bread on top - gross.
Good cole slaw.
Not so good cheesy fries."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location. I have never had bad food or service at this one! I wish I could go there all the time. The PITTSBURGHer is the best!!  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointing. While sandwich is unique it was totally over cooked and under seasoned. No flavor"}
{"text":"True Pittsburgh original! You can't go to pittsburgh without getting a \"sammich\" ! I love the fries here and the beer of course! Be ready to feel full! Great staff as well !"}
{"text":"It was everything I hoped it would be, worth the wait. Quick service delicious double roast and cheddar."}
{"text":"It was a decently filling sandwich, but nothing special about it. I had the cheese fries (it was pretty much molten cheese with bits of fries in it) and the cheese steak sandwich.  It was definitely great to try but I didn't enjoy the mess and the sandwich was a bit bland. Great location to people watch, but would I come here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Awesome original Primanti's. Had cheese fries and salami sandwich. Super nice wait staff. Fast service."}
{"text":"Don't let the imitators fool you, this is THE overstuffed sandwich."}
{"text":"The restroom was one of the filthiest I've ever been in. Makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the rest of the place. Burger was a pressed meat of unknown origin and the black bean burger was chalky. Not much flavor in either. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Cajun chicken sandwich. It includes fries and Cole slaw - both of which were good."}
{"text":"Ohh, Primanni's...

I couldn't go a trip to Da Burgh without a visit to one of their shops.  It was the last place I went before leaving the area. Now, for those few of you who have never been, or are from out of town - this is basically a sports bar for families. We counted something like 18 televisions that we could see, and we couldn't see the whole place.   While our drinks came in glasses, I've been in branches where they came in paper take-away cups.  It's not fine dining, but it's very good at what it is.

I had a bacon, egg, & cheese, which sounds like it would be weird loaded up with tomatoes, that delicious vinegary cole slaw, and fries, but was wonderful.  I also had some fried zucchini which was crisp and zucchinilicious. 

With evil plotting, I also ordered two cheesesteaks to go.  Now, they're currently calling them \"Pitts-Burgers,\" which is nuts, because the 'steak' in the cheesesteak is more meatloaf than burger, but whatever.  The waitress said they've always had more than one name, but I've known them as cheesesteaks since there was only the one shop in the Strip.   Anyway. Because I wouldn't be eating them until the next day I asked for the slaw on the side. The waitress also suggested I get the tomato on the side -- genius!   When I unpacked them from the fridge the next day I opened the little tubs of slaw and found the tomato slices on top!  A little nuking, some quick re-assembly, and *poof* almost as good as fresh.  

The shop seemed handicapped accessible, although I did not try the restrooms. Staff was friendly and helpful.   All in all, a tasty and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! I'm from out of town and Primanti's was recommended to me. Seems like a very authentic Pittsburgh experience. Would definitely go back or try another location in the future."}
{"text":"Super cute little hole in the wall. If you're visiting Pittsburgh it's a great little nook to try. Parking can be kind of hard to find. I also found the French fries seemed to overpower the sandwich making it taste more \"doughy\" then flavorful from the meat."}
{"text":"Came in on a late night during the week to get food. Always enjoyed coming to this location since I live in LOLA ( Lower Lawrenceville ) and this is supposed to be a prime staple of the Steel City. I do agree with some reviews the place is filthy and dirty.... being a germaphob I somehow always seem to put the griminess of this location aside and eat here anyways until... as walking out the late week night I came in a pleasant little mouse  popped from underneath of one of the coolers or cooking station / prep area stations. 

Needless to say, I haven't been back since because seeing a LIVE mouse , kind of put a nail in the  coffin for me . One of the cities fine Health inspectors needs to take a stroll in here and diligently inspect and evaluate the conditions of this location ( I don't care how old or how great of a Pittsburgh landmark and staple this is ) mice carry harmful diseases that can be passed to humans. In addition to the Health Inspectors and Health Department getting involved this location needs thoroughly scrubbed down , cleaned, and their employees need to wash after they hop back inside from smoking out on the corner and wash their hands after they touch cash and then touch all the food on the line. Sorry Primanti's , but you need to get your cleaning act and rodent problem under control at this location. 

Ciao fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I would like to have seen more meat on the sandwich and a better choice of bread.  But then again, that's fast food for you!"}
{"text":"Five stars here for an all around great and fun experience. We had heard about the sandwiches, but didn't realize this was a great bar scene too. We showed up as happy hour was about to start and settled in with some of the locals. Great conversations, fantastic service, and plenty of great advice. I got the bacon sandwich with an egg added to it and enjoyed it. Nothing special, but a good intro to the Primanti Bros concept of putting fries and cole slaw on everything. Also had an order of the street fries which I believe had chili, cheese, bacon, sour cream, and jalapeños. Very tasty!  We added on some slices of pizza and we're not disappointed. After hitting so e other bars we stopped back by for some late night slices. Great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Well I can say I came to Pittsburgh and finally tried the famous sandwich. Oh yes I was in carb coma, but it was so enjoyable. But I have no guilt for eating a whole sandwich by myself. I did wash it down with an ice cold beer. If you are in Pittsburgh like the Food Channel said you have to visit this establishment.  

Now I have to be on a diet :-)"}
{"text":"When I visited Pittsburgh in July, everyone said I had to try a cheesesteak at Primanti's, so I did. Sliced white bread piled with beef, fries, and coleslaw, and topped with another piece of white bread. I ate the greaseball but didn't think it was very good. The slaw tasted like the stuff from a carton and the fries would have been better on the side. I don't get why people love these sandwiches, but it was lunchtime and I was sober so maybe it's really great when it's 2AM and you're drunk.  I love potato chips in sandwiches but fries in a cheesesteak didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Took our friends visiting from out of town and they loved it. I tend to prefer this particular location because it's not usually overcrowded like other locations, which in turn leads to better food. Our server was very friendly, and the food came out nice and tasty.

I actually would NOT recommend the cheese steak...no flavor really. But their other sandwiches are great. I usually get the Cajun chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"This is very near my work so I've been going often. This is one of the \"suburban\" style Primanti's so they have wings, salads, pizza, etc. It's a much smaller space than most of their locations however. Pros: Great happy hour and late night specials, even on weekends. Food has always been good. Cons: The service is pretty meh. The servers have all been very friendly but they all seem brand spanking new to the service industry so they are forgetful and often painfully slow and usually unfamiliar with the menu, draft list, prices, etc. I've tried the garlic parmesan wings a couple times and they are usually very dry, but the other wing flavors have been good. Their regular wings are pretty tiny so I stick with the boneless."}
{"text":"everyone we knew from pittsburgh told us not to leave the area without trying a sandwich from this place.  So as our last stop before hitting the road, we stopped by here.  

It looks like they put fries and coleslaw onto every sandwich. We sat at the bar and watched the cooks make each sandwich and i was in awe of just how much fries they stuff! The guy sitting next to me could tell I was not a local, so he suggested ordering the Capicola to get the true primanti brothers experience.  Whenever possible and if we think it will taste right, we like to order a fried egg on the sandwich. And so, they added that as well. My husband and I decided to share this since the portions are so huge. 

The sandwich itself was really tasty and yummy and I could see why it is a Pittsburgh favorite. If we are ever in the area again, we will come back to try the other options that they have."}
{"text":"Do the tourist thing and get a damn sandwich here.  Its good, honest and all the obnoxious Stiller fans here pack the joint 24/7!  A bottle of Iron City and a turkey provalone sandwich is great for a hangover and a night of regret.  Go Browns..."}
{"text":"Not really sure what the hype was all about. Maybe I ordered the wrong things? I had the burger and thought it was okay. The buffalo chicken wings were okay too. Giving the place 3 stars because at least the service was fast and the staff was nice. However I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  Do you people really eat this slop?  There was nothing good about this at all.  Not one thing.  The texture of the sandwich was foul and it was so greasy I was nauseous for the next 4 hours."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to the area. I am from Pittsburgh and have one close to me, but when I am passing though I like to stop it. Fast service and great Pizza! The Primantis pizza is a hidden gem. Also, the burgers are huge and delicious."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros is not for anyone on a diet. You can't hold the high calorie count against a place like this. This is a legend to anyone who is somewhat familiar with the greater Pittsburgh area. I usually don't go to this particular location on Carson but after a little directional miss-hap we ended up here. 

It's really quite nice and Carson Street is an up-and-coming area of the city. Overall, I thought this particular location was quite charming but my favorite location is still the original downtown. :-)"}
{"text":"Great place to visit if u are in PIT. Lots of character, friendly staff and no nonsense good food."}
{"text":"The food here was good. However, double up on the meat and ask for half the coleslaw. The sandwich was all coleslaw. Bread is really fresh and the service is half half."}
{"text":"Impress your parents
With your sandwich smarts*! Avoid
Going on game day.

*Double cheese, double roast beef"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place this past weekend.  When in Rome, so I tried the pastrami with the fries and cole slaw in it.  Very, good.  A very big sandwich loaded with meat.  And the bread...wow!  I really dug it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty gimmicky and the food is not very good. The queso dip was lack luster and the chicken sandwich was tough and stringy. This may be a good spot to have a drink as there are good drink specials."}
{"text":"This place was hard to find in the dark after a 5 day drive from Texas.

First off, what's up with Pittsburgh and ginger ale?  I've never heard of any place serving ginger ale in a cup, bottle or can in Texas, but here it seems to be everywhere!  Every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended I try their ginger ale and it's really good!  So we all got that to drink.  

To start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me \"don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.\"  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.

I got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich, the wife had the Philly, and the kids had corned beef and a ham.  We had seen the hundreds of TV shows about this place and we were finally here to see if the mix of coleslaw, fries and meat was really as awesome as they say it is.   They were right.   The sandwiches didn't seem as big as they were on TV but they were freakin' awesome.  We all enjoyed these sandwiches more than any sandwich we had ever had before.   We had just had a long day of eating tons of bacon and bacon booze, so I didn't think any of us would be able to finish a big sandwich.  WE DID.  It was soooo good.  

The only bad part about coming to Pittsburgh and visiting Primanti Bros is that we had to go back home the next day!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest - those 'famous' sandwiches aren't very good at all. 50 years ago, they were probably cutting edge; nowadays they are throw back, dull and boring. I'm sorry I just can't get excited about French fries and Cole slaw on a sandwich. 

However it is Pittsburgh history and it definitely a large tourist trap, I can also why people go to the other locations to catch a game and have a beer. But with that being said if you are going here to try their sandwiches because some TV show told you they are the best - you will find that you have been lied to.

Go for the history, go to say you have done it, but don't go expecting an amazing gourmet sandwich experience."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Just as advertised and wow the prices are great. This location was very busy for the holiday weekend of St Patrick's Day but our food came fast and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My family always wanted to try Primanti. What a huge disappointment at the Anchor drive one. The pizza was served with a mound of burnt ashes on the bottom. Not a little, but teaspoons of it, all over. The ovens are not cleaned. I ordered the fish sandwich which came out cold, a soppy mess from the oil on the bread and a chunk of coleslaw core inedible. My sons was no better. The waitress saw we had taken only one bite and asked if we wanted to take home. We both said 'no way.' She didn't flinch and didn't care. I don't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid. In Philly, they'd be out of business in a heartbeat. It is also a dirty, noisy unkempt premises."}
{"text":"Only came for drinks. Drunk duck. Too much for me to handle. Did not eat this visit but have eaten before. Good food."}
{"text":"I think TIM C sent me here to die when he recommended I eat here on my brief stop in Pittsburgh.  I think I got some chest pain eating that sandwich---not the kind from love, the kind from MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.  

Definitely a heavy sandwich.  Heavy on the fries.  Heavy on the thick WHITE bread (us health nuts like wheat/whole grain).  I lost the tomato in all the slaw.  Thumbs up for the slaw.  It was not a pretty sandwich and you will definitely not look pretty eating it BUT---worth a try."}
{"text":"This is a decent sandwich place that is a staple of Pittsburgh. The special feature of this place is that the fries are placed into the sandwich instead of on the side. The sandwiches are very large, and are served on thick Italian bread. I got the capicola and cheese, which one of the chefs told me was one of the most popular choices on the menu. The meat was okay, but overall I felt the sandwich was just a bit too greasy. I also wish there were other options for the bread, as I felt it was too thick. I also didn't like that the sandwiches were served on just paper instead of on a plate or basket - the tables were not exactly clean when I got there."}
{"text":"Best thing i had in Pittsburgh. My food was hot and quick. The beer was cold and there  was plenty of it. I ate and watched the steelers game. Very nice staff. Definitely stop by again next time i am in town."}
{"text":"Overrated, and I like using dishes and silverware when I eat, so I wasn't too impressed by the place."}
{"text":"THE BEST! 

This rating should be way higher. This location is a little divey, but I wouldn't want it any other way. 

The combination of the soft bread, fresh fries, and season vinegar slaw is perfection. I suggest the Cajun Chicken & Cheese!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced everyone who gave this place a 4 star or higher was completely DRUNK OFF their ASS when eating at this place...  i mean it just one of those places where you have to check out because you are visiting Pittsburgh... so only come here if your are tot tally F Up and need some of the night food."}
{"text":"This was definitely an experience. While visiting Pittsburgh, my friends couldn't let me leave without trying the original Primanti Brothers in the Strip District... what a place! We went for lunch, and it was generally busy. The hostess was very accommodating with our large group and seated us pretty quickly. Ordering is no frills; pick a \"base\" to your sandwich, and they're all served with fries (on it), slaw, tomatoes, and onions (if you ask). I ordered the turkey breast and cheese and it was pretty damn good. The turkey actually tasted like it had been hand carved. When the waitress brought our food out, I wasn't sure how we'd be able to eat it all; however, after a few minutes of eating in silence, the sandwiches didn't seem so big and we clearly didn't have a problem chowing down on them. Quick, no frills. It felt like kind of a heavy lunch but I bet this is the ultimate late-night, after-partying place! Would totally recommend for a one-of-a-kind sandwich."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest of restaurants but the service was friendly and the food came out quick and delish! Their sandwiches are insanely big and unique. The waitress was helpful in providing recommendations to us out-of-towers. Recommend the Black Angus sandwich! Yum."}
{"text":"Every great American city, has places you must go to that are practically institutions. Primanti's is one of those places. I first learned about Primanti's while watching a show on the Food Network that highlighted famous food joints around the country. 

While I was visiting a friend in Pittsburgh a few years back, we made the trip to Primanti's. Due to their huge popularity in Pittsburgh, they now have multiple locations, they're even in PNC Park. We made sure to go to the original Primanti's. 

Nothing really complicated here. They serve basically sandwiches, but with a twist. Rather than have your fries, coleslaw and sandwich separate, they bring it all together within the sandwich. 

Naturally, you don't need to order of wings or onion rings with your sandwich. One sandwich will fill you up. Despite the fact tourists frequent the place, Primanti's has the feel of a neighborhood hangout. 

The waiter service was great. The wait for our sandwiches wasn't too long. They have beer on tap, mostly domestic. 

The pastrami sandwich I ordered did not disappoint. Not too fatty. The bread was just right. If I visit Pittsburgh again, I am going to make another stop at Primanti's."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great food in a nice little square for people watching."}
{"text":"I freaking LOVED THIS PLACE!!! 

I recently visited the Keystone state and decided after hearing about Primanti's on TV and from some friends, along with my love of sandwiches, I'd give them a try. Let's just say, four days in Pittsburgh, PA. resulted in four trips to Primanti's Bros....and I can't wait to go back! 

My first venture to Primanti's (I went to the original on 18th Street, which opened in 1933) was at about 3:00am after having a drink or two. The original location is open 24 hours and has the ambiance of on old-fashioned sandwich shop, with that hard steel city type of vibe. I immediately liked it! Their sandwiches come with a mix of slaw, tomato, a touch of provolone cheese and french fries. I have always been leery about having fries in my sandwich but when in Rome, stick anything in your mouth. Being that it was my first trip I went with the Pitts-burger (#2 Best Seller) and a side of cheese fries. Voila! I had an instant mouth orgasm. I'm not a huge french fry guy but DAMN are their fresh cut fries a hit! Lightly salted and packing a ton of flavor. I mean I could not get enough of them and even stole most of the cheese fries from my better half. I was amazed by the flavors I was encountering as I ate my sandwich.

After the first trip I knew I had to go back but I kind of surprised myself when it was less than 12 hours later. When I went back I wanted to try my favorite sandwich, the pastrami. Come to find out that it's Toni's favorite sandwich too. Who's Toni you ask? She is the adorable, spitfire, beautiful, dream of human being who has been a part of Primanti's for decades. She was easily one of my favorite parts about the experiences at Primanti's, along with all of the staff who really care and appreciate you coming into their establishment. Something we don't see enough of these days! Back to my and Toni's favorite, the pastrami sandwich. Holy schnikes! I almost pooped my pants it was so damn good. Excuse my terminology but this was a religious food experience for me. As I ate the pastrami I began to truly appreciate the combination of meat, to slaw, to fries ratio. I mean they aren't the most complicated combinations in the world but damn do those people at Primanti's make the combo work. You even get to taste the acidity of the tomato, followed up with a hint of cheese but the slaw and fries do all the work. 

Day three...trip three, by know I am in love with Primanti's slaw as well as Toni as I run into her again. Pastrami is the choice of the day and I'm totally assured that the slaw is simply insane. Simple in it's mixture of slaw, vinegar, some salt and pepper, oil and sugar. It's just insane to me how it tastes so good. Sticking with the pastrami sandwich I began playing around with the ingredient combos. First, I added extra slaw (on the sandwich and on the side) and then I started to bury my delicacy in hot sauce. Tons of it! I have found my Primanti's sandwich perfection!

Day four...trip four and it was time to say goodbye to my brief but fulfilling edible encounter with Primanti's. On the way to the airport I make my final trip to see my love, she is there, waiting for me with open arms, giving me what I need and desire... Crap! What am I writing here? It was another round with the pastrami, the slaw, hot sauce, fries, and so on to give my pallet what it needs. I know this review is way over the top but that was my experience at Primanti's Bros. WAY OVER THE TOP! I love this place; highly recommend it and dream of a day when they open a joint down here in Texas!"}
{"text":"While in Pittsburgh, we HAD to try the legendary Primanti Bros. and it was the first stop on our trip once leaving the airport. I got the Cajun Chicken Sandwich and despite its deliciousness, I didn't taste any cajun seasoning really and it wasn't spicy in the least bit. The sandwich was still freshly prepared at a good serving size."}
{"text":"Whoa whoa wait, what??

I rarely EVER give one star. 

But, you know...I'm on Yelp to be honest and to help you make informed decisions. So here ya go. 

You know when you're traveling and you gotta pee, bad, so you stop at a gas station and they hand you a key...on a long wooden board, with a chain on it. Immediately you think, uh oh. Not good. 

Yeah. 

Dirty, sticky, trashy , sweaty, cramped. 

That's Primanti Bros (at least this location). 

After climbing the stairs to the second floor and trying not to touch the railing (I think it should be tested by the health department) we sat for approx 18 minutes. We cleaned our own table. Piles of cups and wrappers. 
The table was dirty and no one offered to wipe it. There is supposed to be table service, people. 

We were patient because the few (very few) people working were working hard. Way understaffed. 

People came in after us, got drinks. 
We got,  \"Be right with you.\"
5 more minutes. 
Another group came in after us. 
They got drinks.
We got ignored. 

The staff is not rude, they are highly understaffed.
And it's dirty. Did I mention that already?? Sorry. Not sorry. 

We left. 
Went across street to Stacked. 

That's it."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place got such great ratings. We got the Smallman Street fries, chili cheese fries, sausage sandwich, and corned beef sandwich. Overall, the food was flavorless. Maybe we're just spoiled since we're used to Philly's delicious cuisine.."}
{"text":"Um, wow... not a \"quality\" food place.  Bar food alert. Buffalo chicken and buffalo shrimp were almost inedible... gyro and club sandwich were great. Out of town WRs stopping in for late dinner so we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is about the 7th Primanti Bros. location I have been to and I'd rank this as one of my favorites. Love the location on the Southside. There are a lot of places to check out around the area and Primanti's is the perfect place to start you bar crawl with a tasty sandwich! Regardless of what you get, it is coming with Coleslaw, Tomato and fries. If you don't like that then it's best to know their lingo.  For example, if you don't want the coleslaw, order your sandwich with no grass. If you you just say no coleslaw you might get some strange looks. Luckily I like it all!  I've worked my way through most of the sandwiches and the Capicola and Cheese w/ Egg is my favorite but this time I tried on of their limited sandwiches called the When Pigs Fly. It had a huge pile of Ham and Bacon with Egg along with the other usual suspects. Excellent with some hot sauce added!  We also shared a order of the Loaded Nachos which were top notch!  You really can't go wrong here. Get an Iron City beer to go with your meal and you will be sitting pretty.  I will say this location is one of the smaller ones so seating is limited but we had no problem on a Friday night around 7:30p. The staff here were friendly and attentive so that coupled with excellent food is a win-win in my book!"}
{"text":"I've been to many different location numerous times but had to get to the original. It is smaller and has more of a limited menu (pretty much sandwiches and fries. Sorry no pizza.) and is much more on the divey side but you still get that amazing sandwich and it is an experience to be where it all started.

If to have never had a Primanti sandwich, here is the run down: Pick a meat, it goes on thick bread piled high with vinegar based coleslaw, tomatoes and french fries creating one of the most unique sandwiches out there. 

I know a lot of people say it is a gimmick and really isn't anything special but, forget those people. Try it yourself and make a decision based on your experience.  I've been eating them for years and they never get old to me. I like them and continue to throw money down for one every now and then.  

I had the Hot Sausage and Cheese with a Fried Egg which goes against my normal Capicola and Cheese but I was feeling something different. It was pretty good but not enough to take over my #1 spot! Coupled with cheese fries and an Iron City Beer and it was a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"We had heard about this restaurant on line and via mouth.   We drive 4 hours to a concert.  Arrived at. 11:53 and they sent us away.   Soooooo disappointed.  Service and personalities of staff was awful!"}
{"text":"Having to live in Northern Va for the past 24 years and missing my home town the Steel City of Pittsburgh.......this is a must stop for me when I am in town!!!!  Wahoo!!!! I live for this place.  After all these years we tried a slice of Pizza.  It was good!  My wife is from D.C. and now is in love with these wonderful sandwiches of delight!  If you never been in here your are missing on a treat!"}
{"text":"I visited this location with a friend when we flew into town for a football game. We had a very pleasant experience though the place was kind of small and cramped. The service was great, but I can't imagine what it would be like if the place was busier than it was when we went. The food was amazing. I don't remember what I had, but EVERYTHING was delicious. I would go to this location again."}
{"text":"The location is in a good spot but the parking lot can be a bit of a mess when you depend on people to follow the rules of the road. The interior of the restaurant is normally clean and inviting lots of bright lights the bars right about TVs yada yada

now when it comes down to the thing that you came here for , which is the food at Primanti's it's questionable the number one sandwich is dry most of the time even if you add it with coleslaw and dumped it in my pocket of water. The cajun chicken is reheated on the grill then a kettle bell weight is placed on it to verify it will be dry when you get. The pizza is pretty good for a sandwich shop. 

The bar is loaded with local men watching the games, and occasionally groups from nearby youth rink. You may see a new divorcees on a night but dont expect anything like Southside or strip."}
{"text":"I saw this place on man vs food and had to have it. Every time I come to Pitt I get one and take one home. This shop was one of the better ones I have been to. The staff was great food was great as always and serve time was great what more could you ask for"}
{"text":"Primanti is a MUST if you ever come to Pittsburgh.

The place bleeds with Pittsburgh pride, as the wall is painted with historic and famous Pittsburgh figures, the screens play local sports, and the food just reeks of the Steel City.

As you might expect, the food is rugged, big, and wholesome. There's lots of grease that goes around, and they seem to feel that everything tastes better fried (?). I'm not saying fried stuff isn't bad, but I think it's a little excessive. One of their trademarks is having fries in their sandwiches, and honestly, I think the starchiness makes the sandwiches a lot drier and difficult to down. It also adds a void of blandness that drowns out the sweet lettuce or the savory meat. Also, I'd say their Pitts-burger isn't that great. It's a very standard combination of lettuce, cheese and patty, but I felt that the patty was really dry, and again, the fries got in the way.

Overall though, the place is lively, and is great for bringing large groups of friends to. Definitely drop by if you want a taste of black and yellow."}
{"text":"I should have set my expectations appropriately for a Primanti's location that was not The Strip. The building was nice, the service was ok at best. Our sever seemed to have a lot of tables and was hard to flag down. The small parking lot sucked, I had to park in the overflow lot and walk about half a block. 

But the food was what I came here for - it had been a long time since my last trip to PGH and a hot on a heel, with fries and slaw on it. It was not great, it was pretty dry. My wife got a corned beef, it was as dry as the Sahara. Our fried zucchini app included several \"exploded\" ones that I wouldn't expect they'd serve. So this was a pretty disappointing visit, and the food sat like a rock in my belly all night. I should have picked another Pittsburgh tradition this night....."}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh original and it is awesome!  From the atmosphere to the food, you've GOT to try it!"}
{"text":"This place sucks if you want a primantis sandwich head downtown.  This place is the king of burning pizzas and watered down drinks.   Free benny b."}
{"text":"As a Pittsburgh transplant, the fascination with Primanti's always seemed a little ridiculous. The sandwiches are okay, but they're hardly good enough to overcompensate for their lack of quality service, and pure arrogance that I've experienced from their staff.

This particular location is the perfect example of how Primanti's thinks that living on \"Pittsburgh legend\" status is enough. Why should they provide decent service when your seat will just be replaced by some other fool looking for a sub-par meal because it's \"famous?\"

We only agreed to meet our friends at Primanti's because they advertise that they have NFL Sunday Ticket and we assumed that they'd actually show a variety of games...you know like every other bar that pays for the service. With our group made up of two Steelers fans, one Ravens fan, and one Eagles fan, we were hoping to be able to watch all of the games, but despite this location having a ridiculous abundance of televisions, we were denied the ability to watch the Eagles/Giants or Ravens/Bengals games. We were told that the Steelers would be on all of the televisions, and one TV at the bar would be turned to RedZone, and that since RedZone shows highlights of all of the games, that should suffice. This was coming from the manager, nonetheless! Thanks, man...thanks for not even trying to help your customers out. God forbid, not every one of your customers cares about the local team. Especially at a touristy spot. We saw 3 Ravens fans, and a Texans fan...all roaming around trying to find a TV with their games on. But, hey, they can't possibly change the channel on one of their 50 TV's.

Meanwhile, I look across the bar and we realize that one TV was turned to the Falcons game for ONE fan in a corner booth. Another TV actually had the Giants/Eagles game on it, but that, too, was in a corner booth and the only person who seemed to be watching it was our friend...who was forced to squint to watch from across the bar.

So, in the end, the manager and bartender both contradicted their \"policy\" of only showing the Steelers game. Too bad we couldn't get any reasoning for their decision.

As if that wasn't enough, the service at the bar was laughable. The bartender acted like customers were bothering her when we wanted a drink or to order food. She didn't get our order right, either. So to round off a horrible experience, we didn't get to watch our games AND we didn't get what we ordered, despite being charged for the things they didn't bring out. No apologies, no positive customer service, and nothing but arrogance coming from both the manager and the bartender.

It's a good thing their name will keep the money rolling in, because any other restaurant would be out of business with Primanti's level of service. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Since moving from Pittsburgh 5 years ago, my cravings for the wonderful \"Primanti sammich\" has increased. I make it back about once a year and a trip to this fine establishment is the law. Of course, the ones downtown are a little more \"YINZER\" but the suburban locations are a bit quieter, quaint and a lot less waxed paper is used. The food is still amazing though! My favorite sandwich is the cheese combination because when I started eating Primanti's they didn't have the turkey and I don't eat red meat or bacon.  I know a sandwich with french fries and cole slaws sounds weird...and I have to admit the first time I ate one I wasn't sold right away...but you'll get hooked, I promise! A must for anyone visiting the Burgh!"}
{"text":"This is the original location. GREAT sandwiches! The pastrami is my personal favorite; it is stacked along with a \"fist full\" of Cole Slaw, a \"fist full\" of fresh-cut French fries and tomatoes, between two   thick slices of  Italian bread. DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"I learned fast that Pittsburgh is known for putting fries on top of sandwiches (including salads). I ordered their chicken sandwich and it came with coleslaw and fries. I have to say... it was a bit dry and holy Batman, that was a lot of bread. I'm glad I had a large beer to wash it down with. My colleague had the pastrami sandwich and it came with sauce so hers wasn't as dry. 

The staff were very busy and didn't really check on us until we were finished. I could've used a fork and a glass of water. 

Take this review with a grain of salt. It was the first place I went to in Pittsburgh after a long travel day and it was hot and humid out, which makes me a bit irritable."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Very filling. Excellent service. Fast production. We came at 1230 on a Sunday (Steelers were out of town and a night game) and got our food in about 5-10 min. Amazing. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch at primantis on University blvd. it was delicious. Had the famous sandwich with sirloin steak. My son had the wings and they were tasty. The guys also had to try a slice of pizza and rated it up there with Supinos in Detroit. We did go in during the Steelers game and my husband had on his Lions gear. LOL. Got a few looks but all in all a very relaxed and enjoyable environment.  The fries were very tasty too!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't really buy into the whole random weird thing of putting fries on the inside of a sandwich.  I just don't get it.  But.. that's what they do here and I'm sure Guy Fieri would open his big mouth and talk about it all day.. but I digress.

My friend and I split a couple of the sandwiches, and they were so-so.  Nothing bad about them, and they were inexpensive (compared to Seattle, where I live) so we were satisfied enough.  Good place to get some beer and fill up the belly, but not a place I would excitedly come back to again."}
{"text":"I've loved Primanti's since pretty much my first bite years ago. There are so many options to choose from, but once one becomes a regular you seem to stick to what you like most. For me it is the \"No. 2 bestseller\" cheese steak. Since all the other reviews tell you the sandwich ingredients I won't bore you with the details except to say that even if you don't like traditional coleslaw give Primanti's a try anyway. It really is special. 

Primanti's has been feeding the working people of Pittsburgh for years and for years the sandwich has remained the same. It's great to know that know matter what happens some things in this world remain the same, and this stacked sandwich will always be one of them. 

Some people have complained about the blandness of the sandwich itself. Though I agree that by itself it can be a bit bland, but there is an assortment of condiments you can add to spice it up. I prefer to shake on a little salt and some hot sauce before each bite. I've seen others use pepper and ketchup, and still others just salt and pepper. That's what makes Primanti's so great, everyone's sandwich is personalized to their own tastes and each bite is a little different."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh classic. Cheap, filling, good vibe. I moved away from Pittsburgh a few years back and I crave these sandwiches all the time. Maybe it is just nostalgia, but I return every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is one if those places where you either love it or hate it; we loved it. We visited on a Sunday morning & were seated and served pretty quickly. There were five of us and we all had sandwiches. Recommend you get corned beef & not pastrami, as wife thought it was too bland. 
No real kids menu, So my son, who's give had soup and some pickles. 
There is small parking lot behind the restaurant & it's free."}
{"text":"On a Saturday around 11:30 a.m., I was nervous as we arrived in the Strip District.  There were people on the streets everywhere, there were cars everywhere, and there were parking spots...nowhere!  I was shocked when we walked into Primanti Bros and were seated immediately.  Of course, half an hour later, there was a line going out the door.

I had the Roast Beef & Cheese sandwich.  I wanted to try a cheesesteak, but to my surprise, I didn't see one on the menu.  The waitress insisted it was the \"Pitts-burger,\" but...burger?  The service was OK but impatient when it came to taking orders and overall just inattentive.

My roast beef sandwich was just okay.  I liked the thick bread and the fries embedded into the sandwich.  I don't like cole slaw, so I had my sandwich without.

The fries weren't anything great either.

I know Primanti Bros is famous, but I'd like to know how it became that way.  It reminds me of Gene & Jude's in Chicago - lines out the door, simple food, food that is just okay, but perhaps it's nostalgia that people are chasing after?

I like the simplicity of the menu and ingredients.  I like the giant pickles sliced into four spears.  I also liked the mural on the wall of famous Pittsburgh-ians.  But was it worth paying $5-6 in a public lot?  Not really.  

My opinion about the service changed about an hour after we left.  I looked down at my hand and noticed my ring (just costume jewelry) was missing.  I called Primanti first, to see if anyone turned anything in, and the man on the phone (OK, he was a little abrupt) told me to come in and look.  We went back in and I rushed to the bathroom (I had taken it off while washing my hands), but my ring wasn't on the sink where I left it.  It had slight sentimental value, so I interrupted the lady behind the bar to ask if anyone had turned anything in.  I described what it looked like, and within seconds she handed me my ring.  I don't know if a customer turned it in, or if an employee found it, but I was so grateful that they stuck it behind the bar thinking someone just MIGHT come back for it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches that will fill you up so you can walk the strip for a few hours."}
{"text":"I may get into a lot of trouble with the locals but we were not super impressed with Primanti Brothers. We decide to eat lunch there while exploring the Strip District instead of eating at the stadium location. When we first walked by, the line was wrapped around the building. We decided to explore some more and the second time we swung by, it looked a little less busy so we decided to give it a shot. We maybe waited 5 minutes for a table which wasn't a big deal at all. We ended up sitting at the bar and were immediately offered drinks and menus. 

As for lunch, we ordered some fries to split which we were served right away and they were really good. I had to quit eating them because I was afraid I wouldn't want my sandwich.  I ordered the turkey breast and cheese and my boyfriend ordered the Pittsburger cheese steak. If you've never been, each sandwich is topped with fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes. We both ate our first half of our sandwiches and then decided to try each others. We both liked each others sandwich better than our own. Doesn't it always happen that way! Everything that is on the sandwich sounds delicious and you have to wonder why we weren't jumping for joy but we both felt like the fries on top dried it out some and I know I could have used some more sauce or mayo or something on it.

I'm sure I would eat there again if given the chance and perhaps try a different sandwich. The service and the atmosphere were both great so I can see us returning for a second shot."}
{"text":"I had the Pittsburger and the chili with bread & butter. Both were amazing and the location is really great, I would definitely go back just for this sandwich!"}
{"text":"Tiffany was our waitress. She really  does her job well! Very helpful and seemed to really enjoy what she does. So nice to see someone so happy and smiling. Great food!"}
{"text":"I was in my home town recently and decided to try out one of the famous spots in the area. Specifically a recommendation of my daughter but I had heard of the place and wanted to try it.  I had one the sandwiches I seen on Man vs Food. It was a meal that I could not finish. The sandwich was tasty and large. It has a uniqueness with fries piled on top and a great coleslaw mixture. The setting is more like a pub but it was comfortable. If you are ever in the Pittsburgh area I would definitely recommend trying the place."}
{"text":"Local institution?  Check.
Great classic?  Check.
Provides a quintessential local food item?  Check.
Place to take every first-time visitor to the city?  Check.
Lots of history and culture?  Check.

But at the end of the day, it's basically a french fry sandwich.  You get some coleslaw, and no more than a garnish of meat if you order something sliced (and not a generous portion if you order anything else).  90% of your meal is pretty decent french fries on above average white bread.

Look, I'm glad Pittsburgh has some culinary identity, and having a classic food item you can only get here is awesome.  But compared to a Philly cheesesteak?  A Chicago pizza?  A New Orleans muffaletta?  Pittsburgh has a long, long, LONG way to go."}
{"text":"Awesome late night spot in Pittsburgh! Came here looking for a quieter chill spot and it was the perfect choice. All their sandwiches have fries, coleslaw, provolone cheese, and tomatoes on them. The coleslaw was surprisingly light, not the usual overly mayo-y kind you see. The sandwiches are very filling, so come hungry. The double egg and cheese was great. My friend had the capicola which he also enjoyed. They also have several beers on tap, including a local Church Brew beer. Our server was also patient and humorous with us as newbies :)"}
{"text":"I'm gonna get slaughtered for giving this place a bad review, but whatever. 

I was told by several people that I absolutely HAD to check out Primanti Bros while I was in Pittsburgh. I was excited about visiting this institution during my stay... but it really didn't deliver for me. 

Yes, this was a huge sandwich with fries and cole slaw in it, but the sheer quantity of food didn't make up for the fact that it was really bland. Maybe I just got the wrong thing (the Pittsburger Cheese Steak - which is somehow their #2 seller...?). My friend liked her sandwich, which was eggs and bacon, I believe. Maybe we just went to the wrong Primanti Bros location. 

I would give this place another shot if I'm ever in town again, but my first impression wasn't a great one."}
{"text":"First off, as everyone may know, there's a lot of hype surrounding the sandwiches from Primanti Bros so it's always been on my list of places to eat at in Pittsburgh.  I came looking for a late night meal on a whim with my boyfriend so I got to avoid all the lunch traffic.  There was one guy at the counter, who was neither friendly nor rude. Just asked us what we wanted, served it, and that was that.  Quick and simple. I ordered the pastrami and cheese with an egg, because that was recommended by so many yelpers. I could have done without the egg, I could barely taste it since it was completely cooked under all that pastrami.  I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich though.  The portion was huge and it was definitely flavorful.  Between my boyfriend and I, we devoured the pastrami.  His Pittsburgher cheese-steak was definitely a disappointment, on the other hand.  It was just an underwhelming, sad cheeseburger with fries and coleslaw on top.  He ended up eating just one half and I shared the other half of my sandwich with him.  

I would definitely go again if I were in the area late at night with munchies or something, but I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to eat there during the day, considering how busy it gets. It is definitely not my favorite restaurant, but I'm glad I went to try it."}
{"text":"Had the Pittsburger, which has the fries and slaw on the sandwich as I think most sandwiches do here, was very average...not a ton of flavor. Fries by themselves were good, slaw was average. It's a historic place with fun atmosphere. We had more than one person recommend it but we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Service with a smile and the warmth of the heart of Pennsylvania at this legendary institution of over 72 years! Known for their heartily crafted sandwiches, I had no problem eating a gob stopping gluttons gleeful gourmet of their nearly famous number two. The monstrosity was filed with hand cut potatoes, Salisbury steak, and a vinegar based coleslaw. Oddly delicious and a must try your first time here. I must say that the gracious service really made the food taste even better. Tonight, Chauncey is my server and her smile and genuine delight in serving the fare of this place makes her more than famous!
By the way... the salad and wings are very tasty here too. Nothing disappointing."}
{"text":"During a short get-a-way to Pittsbergh Primanti's was on of the places on the top of our list of must try its.  We have seen the restuarnt on TV, saw the large number of Yelp reviews, and heard from friends and family who have made the travels to the \"Steel City\".  The chain it's anything that will blow you away seating and decor wise, but it is a reflection of the area.  My wife and I tried the fish versino fo their famous sandwhich, and some ice cold local brews.  The sandwhich, much like the decor, is rather simple thick fried fish, slaw, and fries on top.  That said, I WANT ONE RIGHT NOW!!!  The fresh fries, vineger slaw and thick cut fish sandwhiched between fresh thick delicous french bread all come together perfectly.  Add on an ice cold Iron city, and you have yourself one hell of a hearty meal.  The total cost for the two sandwhiches and three beers was lower than I figured too.  I noticed the local chain has expanded all the way up to Erie, PA.  Now whats the chances we can open one out here in Phoenix, AZ!"}
{"text":"My first Primanti. It was good. I got their most popular one. I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a primanti bros, I have seen it numerous shows about this place on the travel channel and food network and I must say this place didn't disappoint.

For those that don't know anything about primanti to bros they make sandwich with meat, vinegar based coleslaw, tomato and fries stuffed between two slices of Italian bread.

If for whatever reason this tasty sandwich doesn't tickle your fancy, this location does offer a variety of other choices such as pizza, wings, and burgers.

 Enjoyed my experience at primanti bros and will be back next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Primanti's is to Pittsburgh as Pat's King of Steaks is to Philly - an icon, a novelty, a must try, and a quintessentiially hometown institution.  Ah, but how's the food?  My view: good food and great value.

I've been to this location (their flagship and the original) as well as the Steubenville Pike one.  I don't know if it's true for their other locations, but these two are very comparable.  So this review constitutes my take on both.  

This is bar food - greasy, flavorful, unpretentious, messy, and great with beer (though not Iron City Light - Yuck!).  The decor is pure Steeltown sports tribute,  heavy on Steelers and Pens, but nary a Pirate (I wonder why. It's not the Bucs' fault that MLB's economics make it impossible for small markets to compete, and the Pirates were GREAT before the Yanks and Sox started ruining baseball by outspending every other team).  Putting the fries and slaw right on the sandwich is fine with me, because the sandwich basically disintegrates after your first savory bite.  I suppose those who complain about the fries on the sandwich probably wanted to drown them in ketchup anyway.  The Italian bread is thick and soft; I've never been here and had it stale (despite some of the other reviewers' comments).  I do miss the knockwurst, but there's still a good array of choices.

Again, I think the prices are good and the food is a high quality bargain.  Well, maybe not the wings at the Steubenville location - I think $4 for 5 wings is a bit too much, but maybe that's the Western New Yorker in me talking.  Oh, and the chili was good (with onions and cheddar added), but not of the 5 alarm variety.  All joking about IC Light aside, their draft selection is solid - lots of variety.  This is a great place to watch a game, strap on the feedbag after a night on the town, or sample an authentic Pittsburgh institution."}
{"text":"We've been there because a lot of my friends recommend me this place. I liked it, as they put a lot of tasty stuff on their sandwiches. But unfortunately the bread tastes like nothing. They could improve on that.

The waiter was very rushing as there was a long line in front of the restaurant. We also had to wait there for about 15 minutes. After we ate our sandwiches, he couldn't wait to bring us the receipt and get our money. 

After all, I can say that you should go there once, because it is like a tourist feature. Though once is enough in my opinion."}
{"text":"I just went to the one by pitts pa airport. I had the steak sandwich with fries an slaw on it.  The fries were good. The steak chewy. The servers were really nice the place clean  .  I dont think i will order that sandwich again"}
{"text":"If you want Primanit's, you have to go to this one. It's the original, and in my opinion the best experience. I think some of the other ones offer more menu options, but you can't beat the real deal. I've never had a bad sandwich or experience here, and the service is always friendly and quick. And not to mention, they make strong drinks too! 

If you are new here and still unaware, this place is a Pittsburgh staple, it's been operating since the 30's, and is probably the most iconic Pittsburgh restaurant. Their deli 'sammiches' hit the spot, piled high on thick cut Italian bread with cole slaw and fresh cut French fries. 

Don't like deli sandwiches? That's fine, they also have wings, pizza, fish, spaghetti, chili, nachos, and salads just to name a few. I honestly can't vouch for any of those besides the chili because 9 times out of 10 I can't resist ordering the traditional sammich! But I've heard from many people they're all good! 

Another interesting thing, they don't take down orders; They've got this stuff down to a science! Even when they're getting slammed. And yes, they do get slammed; it's typically pretty busy around bar closing time since they are open 24/7. You have to experience that at least once to consider yourself a true Pittsburgher."}
{"text":"Not as good of an experience as eating it on the strip, but it'll do. I always get the salami and cheese. 

The differences I noticed: 

1) Bread crust was hard and chewy like it had been sitting out too long. 
2) Salami was cut thicker, wasn't as tender, and just didn't seem up to the quality of what they serve on the strip. 
3) Seemed slightly smaller, but that might also be because they didn't cut it in half here. 
4) The slaw was a lot more wet, which I still can't decide if it was a good or bad thing. 

Other than that, the sandwich still tasted good, just not as good as the strip."}
{"text":"I went there for the most unusual Saturday mid morning snack and was pleasantly surprised by their full offer of wings, of which I got the aptly titled \"snack portion\". 
The wings were zesty and crunchy and while they have a disappointing lack of dry rubs (they didn't even understand what that meant, surprisingly), their garlic and Parmesan wings were quite tasty and got devoured quickly.
Given the early time of day I didn't explore their alcoholic offering, but they seemed well stocked.
The server was kind but clearly inexperienced and would have needed some more supervision, and possibly a keener eye as regards refills.
Overall a pleasant quick stop"}
{"text":"Got here and your ago. Order loaded nacho and boneless wings. She comes out with the food and its only the boneless chicken. Like lol I only order 2 things are you kidding me"}
{"text":"I went to the Strip District location with a few friends and we were fortunate enough to get seats at the bar. This, from what I am told, is pretty uncommon. All the tables (all 4 or 5 of them) were full and the line was starting to form.

Anyway, we all ordered the \"famous\" cheese steak...fries in it and all. And, well, it was absolutely nothing special. The fries were soggy and the meat was tasteless. Basically, it was like eating cheese fries with boring bread. 

Between the lack of food quality, the crowded space, and the ugly decor, this place is possibly the most overrated restaurant in Pittsburgh. Save yourself the effort."}
{"text":"Maybe it's me just being from NYC but this place was kinda dirty looking. All that behind the food was pretty good. I got a massive grilled chicken sammich that came packed with French fries! It would have been better if it was a little warmer but the waitress apologized that multiple people called or of work that day so I understood. The beer selection was good as well with A variety of local brews. I'm glad I came here bc everyone said u can't go to Pittsburgh without trying this sand which joint. I hope to come back maybe try a different location and give a much better review. But to me it was just average for now."}
{"text":"If you want all that is Pittsburgh in a pile of deliciousness, GO HERE.  Primati's is one of my favorite places to eat at any time of the day.  I usually go here with a couple of guys and order a beer and a sweet sausage sandwich with bacon, egg and some extra cheese.

The coleslaw is sweet and has the perfect amount of vinegar.  The fries are that great kinda crunchy, kinda moist feel and the bread is a perfect cloud of lightness.  I prefer sweet sausage or kielbasa but everyone has their own preference.  I sometimes get a side of fries to go along with the meal and share it with the guys.

The guys that work here are awesome and care about people having a great experience.  Definitely get some quality sandwich here.

(Also, you should not be altering and substituting items on this sandwich, no fries or slaw on the side!!! Get it as is!!!)"}
{"text":"I don't care what any says about this place. I love it. 
The food is prepared in an open setting so even if they hate you, they can't spit in it. I've had a variety of food from the menu (from their colossal fish sandwich to their signature steak) and all of them have been BOMB (good). 
It's a pretty hip atmosphere/grunge possibly because they haven't washed the floors in centuries and it's caked with fatty goodness. 
The serving sizes are large and the price is pretty good, the meal could last a normal person for 2 days, or an insatiable like me, 30 minutes."}
{"text":"People knock on this place - but I always find myself defending it. 

While it may be overrated for being featured on the food network, it is a pretty good sandwich place (no not just because the portions...while they are generous) 

The fries are a bit bland but I'm a huge fan of the cole slaw they have there - while it may not be anything \"special\" it's a classic (not creamy cole slaw mind you). The colossal fish sandwich is pretty good. The cheese steak is not a cheese steak! But that's because I'm from Philadelphia and any cheese steak that isn't made and prepared there is not a cheese steak to me. 

The only thing is the sanitation there is...questionable.  Just don't think about the sticky surfaces and slimy-ish floors. 

For a cheap, giant sandwich I'd take the germs any day."}
{"text":"Everything was fine. Cant say anything bad about this experience. I stepped out of my comfort zone and instead of getting the fish sandwich, I tried the gyro with slaw, which was fantastic."}
{"text":"I thought this was a really unique restaurant with great service, great prices...I really didn't get the french fries built into the sandwich.  So I spent most of the meal picking fries out of a sandwich that I ordered as a grilled cheese & fries...it was not grilled but lightly warmed bread and the fries dumped into the sandwich, at the time I just found it strange.  In retrospect, I think it's one of the most brilliant sandwich ideas ever.  Now I regularly make panini sandwiches at home with fries in them.  Go to this place with a more open mind than I did and you'll love it...it will be my first stop next visit to the city!"}
{"text":"Maybe the second visit is what I needed. After the first, I was thinking \"yeah, that was cool. Now I can check it off my list.\" I guess over the past few years I have grown a new appreciated for a $6 sandwich stuffed with all of the \"necessaries\" - ya know, fries, coleslaw, corned beef and fresh bread. Or it could be my new appreciation for eating on paper with food dripping down my chin. It's hard to say really.

Don't let the line at the front door scare you away. It moves quickly. Inside you'll find that old time, roll your sleeves up vibe that fits Pittsburgh beautifully. Bathrooms are in the basement. Wrap around bars and booths available. Truly a staple if you find yourself in the Steel City!"}
{"text":"I had heard of this place when I was 16 from a couple of chefs I worked with in MA...I finally made it!!! 22 yrs later...eek! It did not disappoint! Pastrami and provolone sandwich with every thing!!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster, tasteless food.

Ate at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9), but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory, bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.

We also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day, but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning, explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.

The legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here, but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch."}
{"text":"Happy to try a Pittsburg local restaurant! =) I was quite pleased with my sandwich and the hospitality. Would def. go back."}
{"text":"Going for the must-have local eateries, we stopped by the original Primanti Brothers restaurant as suggested for our sandwiches.  

Similar to most of the other local famous eateries nationwide, this place is packed and has the typical \"charming\" decor with the wall of the famous celebrities who've eaten there, old chairs/tables/signs to give the place a sense of history, and lack of sincerity because you are there to eat a part of history.

I got the angus steak sirloin Primanti sandwich that was assembled by one guy using his bare hands as follows: white bread, beef, one slice of American (?) cheese, a handful of fries, a handful of cole slaw, one slice of tomato, white bread.  It was a tasty sandwich indeed, but seeing the how greasy and sloppy the guy made our sandwiches, I'd probably end up having a heart attack or food poisoning if I eat more of those sandwiches.  My friend got the regular cheesesteak, and that \"steak\" looked more like a mushed-up patty and didn't look so appetizing to eat.

Been there, done that.  No need to go for it again."}
{"text":"Really the only time I have eaten Primanti's is after a heavy night of drinking so I will say it's good 'drunk\" food (hence the 3 star rating) but the quality of the actual sandwich, to me, is subpar. Usually the fries are soggy, as is the bread. The coleslaw is usually overly dry and lacking that slight vinegar flavor it should have. There are always very loud,very intoxicated fellow patrons (not knocking that cause I was 21 once-been there done that) and service is (usually) gruff. I'm not a fan of the limited beer selection either. I will say I'm not a native Pittsburgher so maybe this is more acquired but there are much better places to take out of town visitors to eat that unless they begged, Primanti's would never even appear on my radar. Also,FYI it's cash only. They do have an ATM if you need it."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice however we only seen her when it was time to pay! Food was good! Work to do here, but disappointed compared to the others."}
{"text":"Girlfriend isn't a fan, but I enjoyed the Pittsburgh style sandwiches. The Roethlisburger is pretty good. Good experiences everytime here I thought."}
{"text":"Holy cow we've hit the motherload!  

Sammiches w/ cole slaw and fries (may sound gross) but it really is the best thing ever.  You should try it.  This is a MUST if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Carbs, carbs, and more carbs......this is a horrendous place to eat.
Steer as far away from this place as you can. 

Minus five if allowed.

Fries on a crummy beef sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than the Steelers have won AFC Championships and Super Bowls. I love this Primanti's the best because it has the most nostalgia and the sandwiches here always seem to taste better. It's a great environment and the employees rock. Stop by and grab a Pittsburgher Cheese Steak with egg and a Iron City beer the next time you're in the Steel City. Yinz Rock!!!"}
{"text":"Is there any greater joy than trying a city's food specialty, the thing that locals can't stop talking about? Whether or not you actually love the item is kind of beside the point. When I heard about the Primanti's sandwich and how passionately people felt about this long-standing institution, I knew I had to give it a shot. 

We're talking about a sandwich that comes on slices of white bread, your choice of meat, along with cole slaw and fries IN the sandwich. (Why is it that a local speciality is never a light, good for you, veggie-heavy dish?) You can go with a burger as the meat and then it's a Pittsburger. I went with the roast beef myself, and couldn't help but get a side of chili as well, which ended up being huge. It's a giant, messy sandwich eating experience and you just have to go for it and get your hands dirty. With no sauce on it I'd say it needed a bit more flavor, but it seems like the experts have their own ketchup and/or hot sauce solutions that greatly improve it. I was especially impressed by the cole slaw, which is crunchy and has a great flavor, which is probably due to a ton of sugar in it but I can't be sure. 

I definitely wouldn't suggest getting this to go, as I would imagine that the bread and fries would get soggy immediately. Anyway it's more fun to eat it in this old location which doesn't look like it's ever been remodeled (which I loved), served all messy just on a piece of paper by a hilarious and friendly server. 

Cash only, which isn't my favorite, but also open 24 hours which is just brilliant because though I give the sandwich a B+ at a normal hour, as a late-night snack after a night out I think I'd give it an A++++. A perfect example of an indulgent local treat that you've gotta try at least once!"}
{"text":"Not much else to be said. Ok, I get it. People have their opinions of this place and I guess I see how some are disappointed. To that I say COME ON! I went here 3 times over a 4 day trip to Pittsburgh. My first night there at around 1am I showed up. Of course it is a legendary establishment and the corned beef is a well-known sandwich there.  So I already mapped out this would be my first stop in Pittsburgh. I arrive, greeted by friendly, but not fake over the top friendly, more of a \"hey how you doing\" staff of 2 employees. They are no-nonsense, they aren't there to wear \"flare\" and serve every dish with a smile. Order your awesome sandwich and keep it moving. So I sit at the bar, get my corned beef sandwhich with \"everything\", and take a bite. I think to myself, this is everything I thought it would be. The entire time the employees checked in \"You good? Need anything?\". I saw lots of comments from people saying they are rude. No, they wont say \"sir, may I kindly get you a beverage for your meal?\". But they will ask \"can I get you a drink?\". Awesome staff.  Had a pastrami and bacon sandwich the 2nd and 3rd visit. I ate several places in Pittsburgh but this was by far the highlight. Just go here if you're in Pittsburgh, its that simple. Open 24/7 and cash only."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location on a visit from out of town. The sandwiches are tasty and the prices are good. You can sit up in the loft and see the whole kitchen from a bird's eye view."}
{"text":"Food is OK, the service was good, basically just average. Would go if someone else wanted to but wouldn't choose to go myself."}
{"text":"Service from Haley the bartenderess will spoil you! Despite the crowd, bartenders and kitchen worked as a very well-oiled team getting drinks and eats out. Very impressive team!

Food I ordered:
Boneless chicken wings/traditional buffalo sauce: ok, nothing special

Slice of pepperoni pizza: Ok, nothing special

Steak and french fry salad....unusual, ok...

Happy hour drink specials are The Reason to visit. It attracts a nice young working class crowd. Must try a Drunken Duck!"}
{"text":"After seeing Primanti Bros on Man versus Food, I had to go there. Driving through Pittsburgh with a broken Tom Tom GPS system I eventually got to Primanti Bros a long time after I had set out.

First impressions are that the restaurant is run down and needs a refurb. The staff are friendly, large screen tv in the back where I can only imagine is on 24/7 with the local sport. Bathrooms could be cleaner, the physical appearance needs work.

Now, down to the real part. I ordered the Black Angus Steak sandwich which an extra side of fries. The fries are tasty, amazing when covered in salt and vinegar but thats only the padding around the main reason you go to Primantis. If you are going there, you are going to taste their sandwiches.

The bread is so soft and fresh it makes the sandwich taste so much better than most sandwichs you will ever eat. The sandwich is piled high with fries, coleslaw and Angus steak. Whats not to like?

For $6.79 this is one of the best sandwishes you will ever get. Compare that to Hannahs Bretzel in downtown Chicago where you pay $10 for an average sandwich and you know you are onto a winner with Primantis.

If in Pittsburgh, go to Priumanti Bros."}
{"text":"So I had a sandwich they are famous for.  When it arrived I realized that the sandwich was HUGE- spicy Italian ham, coleslaw, tomatoes and french fries between delicious french bread.  No sauce but there was catsup and tobacco on the table.  The ham and bread was very good but that's the only items here worth recommending.  Then the floors OMG!!!! They were so greasy it was like a skating rink and treacherous!   I was wearing sketcher tennis shoes and it was like wearing ice skates. All the way from the front door to the restroom and to my table near the bar.  I mentioned the floors to the waitress.  I would tread very carefully if you step in.  It's a lawsuit waiting to happen."}
{"text":"The fries go inside, not on the side, of these deliciously messy sandwiches. 

Primanti Bros. is a historical and must-visit destination if you are doing a food tour of Pittsburgh. They are known for their innovation of putting the french fries inside of your sandwich (truckers not only need to keep their eyes on the road, but they also need their potatoes). 

I got a pastrami with a pickle on the side and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was piled high with fries and coleslaw. It was surprisingly well assembled so things never got too out of control. 

Our waitress seemed hostile, yet in the end was very attentive and responsive. It added to the atmosphere and fit the vibe of the place, so it was all good. 

Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Had to stop and visit the original while in Pittsburgh! Wasn't not disappointed with the \"pitts-burger sandwich! Coleslaw, French fries and your choice of meat! I did double meat with Pastrami and ham! It was delicious and being in the original takes you back 80 years to a very different time and place!"}
{"text":"I learned about Primanti Bros years ago after watching countless travel shows on iconic food establishments and finally had the opportunity to check it out on a road trip.  They're famous for meat-heavy sandwiches stuffed with fries which leaves you full and happy.

He got the Cajun Chicken and Cheese and I went with Pastrami and Cheese.  I think the slaw is what really makes the sandwiches - thinly shredded and vinegary!  The bread was too thick and soft for my liking but I usually prefer my sandwiches toasted so if I have a chance to go to Primanti Bros again, I'll ask for it toasted.

Service was good and it's definitely an ideal stop to watch games and for large group gatherings.  I'm glad I visited and while the experience wasn't totally memorable, I can totally see why Primanti Bros is a Pittsburgh highlight."}
{"text":"This is like a heart attack diabetes sandwiche that is sooooo filling yet delicious....we ordered the philly cheese and pastrami and only finished half of the sandwiche, it comes stacked with fries and slaw, just look at my pic and you'll get the picture....I had instant food coma right when I got back to the hotel....don't expect it to be a classy place...it's pretty dingy like a bar and limited seating, but hey this is the original primanti brothers"}
{"text":"If you haven't gone, go now. If you have gone, go again. If you are there now, order. If you've already ordered, order more. So good and a truly unique taste. Everything on the menu is outstanding and one of a kind."}
{"text":"Holy Sandwich Batman! 

When visiting Pittsburgh to attend my niece's graduation from CMU, she took us here for a bite to eat. 

Looking at the menu, it's hard to decide. I finally decided on the New Yorker with a local beer.
Their sandwiches come with slaw and fries on the sandwich. Mine came with pastrami, corned beef, Swiss, and a spicy beer cheese as well. 

The sandwich was huge!!!!! There's no skimping on meat here. And while the flavors of the sandwich went well together, the thing I liked best is the bread which was soft and when you pushed the slices together it made all those flavors marry together even better.

Definitely check one of their locations out if you ever get the chance. Best sandwich I ever had!"}
{"text":"So Primanti Brothers is definitely something you must try if you are visiting Pittsburgh, but that's about all you're going to do...try it and probably not come back.

It's an interesting sandwich with thick bread (not toasted), choice of meat, coleslaw, option for onions and of course fries in the sandwich.  The fries are not that flavorful and were quite dry when I had it.  I ordered it with easy fries and slaw and it still overpowered the sandwich.  The overall sandwich is not bad, but it's definitely not amazing or even up to par with other sandwich shops. 

I would recommend trying it at least once and I can see myself venturing back here every couple of months or so if someone new is in town to visit, but it is definitely not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"I think the best part of this location (other than the food), is watching the game of the moment. Not a bad seat exists because there are tvs everywhere. I went there (by myself) to watch the pens game. I got a great little table but was pretty much ignored by my server. I had to ask to order another drink and she never brought me water after I asked. I planned to eat and have a few drinks as the game went on but I left before the puck even dropped. I could understand if they were totally crowded but they weren't which made it nice, but the cold shoulder drove me away. The HBK Sandwich and Moscow mules were great though."}
{"text":"can anyone say, \"the best damn sandwich I've ever had\"? Because that's what this is. Primanti's uses fresh bread, crisp coleslaw, tasty french fries and heaps of meat to make their sandwiches.  Their quick service (although a little on the rough side at this location) makes sure you have your sandwich in your hands within 10 minutes of ordering.  Try the pastrami, pretty good if I say so myself, almost as good as the stuff you get in NY!  

This place rocks. A staple of any Pittsburgh visit."}
{"text":"best sandwich in all of Pittsburgh! I love their corned beef! This is truly a Pittsburgh staple and is always at the TOP of my list whenever I come to Pitt. This location is smaller than the one in the packing district with a lot less seating, this location is better for take out."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh recently a was told by more than one person that I have to visit Primanti Bros.  We originally planned on the Cherry Way location but were in Market Square and we were starving. 

We walked in and it was pretty busy.  We waited a few minutes for an empty table and found one.  We cleaned if off ourselves and that was okay with me.  I was pretty excited about this place because of the reviews and other personal recommendations.  

I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and my partner ordered one with more than one type of lunch meat.  The sandwiches were simply sandwiches with coleslaw and French fries on top.  There was nothing special about it and it's something easily made at home.  The price was good.  For a beer, coke, and two sandwiches we got of there for under $20.  

The condition of the women's restroom was horrible.  It ruined my appetite.  You'd think with such a reputation that that condition of the restroom would be a bit nicer.  The restaurant itself was in crappy shape as well.  I expect dive bars to look like this.  

Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I won't be coming back to a Primanti Bros.  There's surely better food out there and a better dining environment."}
{"text":"This was my very first very and it was pleasant. The sandwich was delicious. I had the burger which is the #2 best seller.  The service was good I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We loved the Bloody Mary Bar!  The thick sliced white bread that accompanied each sandwich was soft and very fresh.  This is an iconic Pittsburgh restaurant and my 20 something daughter is not sure she'd come back soon, but I would.  I always try every restaurant three times before making a final decision."}
{"text":"It was alright.  My husband got the Capone sandwich and I got the vegetarian one (black bean).  The unique thing that they do is add fries and cole slaw in the sandwiches, however, that makes the sandwich taste very bland and dry.  We doused it into hot sauce which helped.  It was alright, I don't think it lives up the hype and I don't think I'd recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Not much you can really add to reviews for Primanti's. I think everyone has eaten here at least once and it's pretty consistent. Great sandwiches, what's not to like. The bathroom here could use a good cleaning but the food was great"}
{"text":"Over-rated. I got the pastrami and I'm probably spoiled by Katz's and all the other amazing Jewish delis in NYC but this pastrami did not have enough flavor. I was also expecting a very vinegar/malty cole slaw but it was basically just plain cabbage. The fries were soggy and not good. 

It's incredibly cheap here with a great late evening happy hour although the IPA recommended by the waitress as \"everyone's favorite\" wasn't all that flavorful either. Unfortunately, Primanti's failed to live up to the hype."}
{"text":"The original. The best.  Cash only in the strip district.  Worth every effort. Get it with everything and always add the egg.."}
{"text":"Great service, super friendly staff.  Roast beef sandwich w/ cheddar, slaw and fries -- absolutely fine, in keeping w/ Primanti tradition.......but like so many reviewers before, would it kill them to keep the fries in the fryer 45 seconds longer to make them crisper?  If it's your signature move (slaw and fries on all sandwiches) you best execute it right.  Any trip to the 'burgh, a truly underrated city, deserves a stop at Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"WHOA! This place is INSANE. A Pittsburgh staple that must be explored! I had the corn beef, which was delicious....since it was my first sandwich I didn't know what to expect.  The meat and cheese were delicious, I LOVED THE COLESLAW, but the french fries were just a little too much for me, but OH WELL! I pulled those babies off and scarfed down the rest in two sittings because the sandwich was just too damn big....#firstworldproblems. Overall, I can't wait for my next experience, I'm going to hold the fries and enjoy the rest! So delicious, you cannot come to Pittsburgh without a Primanti's sandwich or what's the point??! ***Afterwards, I picked up some new Steeler swag at the shop next door! Primanti Brothers for the win!"}
{"text":"This location is the original and the best. Sandwiches are really good for what they are. If you've never tried one, they probably won't blow you away, but they are uniquely Pittsburgh and that's why you're here, right? That's not to say that I don't crave these damn things in the middle of the night sometimes, because I definitely do. Primanti sandwiches are what you'd make in your own kitchen if you were shit-faced drunk at 2am, only you don't have to because they've done all the work for you. Try the double-meat hot baloney. Jesus Christ, that sammich is good...Anyway, If you get just ok service here consider yourself lucky because most of the time it downright sucks. Tip: Order a large drink or two beers to start, because no one is EVER coming back to your table to see if you need anything. Just pretend that shitty service is part of the \"charm\" of this place and you'll have a great time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I hit the Primanti Brothers Market Square location to see if the sandwich lives up to the legend and it does. The shop offers a wide array of versions from beef to fish but the grilled steak has rich flavor that is nicely cut by the slightly vinegary Cole slaw. The addition of the fries and Cole slaw on top of the sandwich will make any of the offerings at Primanti a delicious and unique flavor of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I guess you have to try this out if your not from Pittsburgh!

I had the sweet sausage, Hubs had hot sausage, my oldest had ham and my youngest ordered chicken fingers.  The chilli was good, but the bread it came w/ was stale.  They put cole slaw and french fries on the sandwiches.  I thought that it just made the sandwiches bland and starchy.  But not bad...just blah.  The bread was nice and soft and they have several different kinds.  
I am not a beer drinker, but they looked like pretty good prices.  The place was very crowded and you seat yourself.  We lucked up on an empty table, although it was by the door.  The place looks much bigger on the outside."}
{"text":"Good beer and food was really good but the service was mediocre at best. But I love that I can here the game and not random music by Rihanna"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a must when you are in Pittsburgh, and the Strip District location is the original. Roast Beef with fresh slaw, tomatoes and fries on Mancini's bread makes for a sandwich you can just barely shove in your face. Bring your appetite and check your manners at the door, 'cause it's gonna get messy!"}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is a Pittsburgh legend. While this Primanti Brothers do not have the classic appearance of the original restaurant in the strip district it does offer the same classic Primanti Brother food. I have tried several of the Classic Sandwiches and my favorite is the Cajun Chicken. This Primanti Brothers is located near our Hotel and we tend to visit several times whenever I am in the area. We are always greeted and seated promptly and our waitress quickly appeared and took our drink order. Once our order was taken our food was prepared and delivered quick. During football season this would be a great place to catch a Steelers game and since the Pirates are back in the mix catch a baseball game here too if you can't make it to the park. As always our food was good and is the reason we keep returning."}

{"text":"Dinner Dec 7
  Service was incredible.  Atmosphere was \"my kinda place\" except for all the Steelers stuff, but hey, I was in Pittsburgh.
  Got the #2 best seller -- the #1 best seller you ask - BEER.
  This sandwich was a monster.  And at $7.99 a very very reasonably priced entree.  I heard tell Pittsburgians drink and can eat two of these things! SALUTE, cuz my fat arse couldn't finish 1 !  My only compliant/comment on the #2 was it needed a sauce of some sort or maybe ketchup/mayo - which I will do next time!
  Got the Retro Tots - loved them, but loved that house made dipping sauce EVEN more.  Upon further discussion, learned some of the Primanti insiders put that retro tot sauce on their sandwiches - great idea.
  Wings were very small and priced accordingly - but sauces were way above average."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going to Primanti's without having to go downtown.  Since moving from Pittsburgh 15 years ago, I didn't realize how much they had expanded.  The experience was one of the very few times that I left a very low tip:  about 10%.  The restaurant was not busy, yet our server was nowhere to be found.  She never asked how things were, asked if we wanted refills or even boxes and we had to flag another server down to find our server so that we could get our check.  Terrible service, but I'm sure it's not a standard in the restaurants.  The memories of the sandwiches had my mouth drooling.  However, it was not nearly as good as I had remembered.  The sandwich was lukewarm (I had the corned beef) and was nothing special.  My dining partners felt the same about their sandwiches:  they were just ok.  
Between the subpar service and the average food, it's worth checking out another restaurant or maybe just another location of Primanti Brothers.  There were never any complaints about the original."}
{"text":"Best and most filling sandwich ever. Packed with fries and coleslaw. I had seen it on tv on many shows. It was better than it looked.
Fast service and food preparation."}
{"text":"I got a pits-burger and a bud lite. It was $15 with tip. The sandwich was a great size but definitely nothing special. I'm not from Pittsburgh so I went there because of several recommendations. It's worth a try but wouldn't go  there again"}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives within walking distance of Market Square and Primanti's is our go to spot. They make a killer Moscow Mule and you can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches. We also like this place because it never gets too loud and the atmosphere is fun yet relaxing."}
{"text":"I've had their sandwiches both at their original place and at the ball park and they're excellent. They're opening locations in Michigan and Indiana hoping that they come to the Chicago area. Haven't tried their pizza and not sure how that would go over here."}
{"text":"Everything about the restaurant Primantis is the complete opposite about the original. Last night we had horrific service and that seems to be the theme    The server was friendly, but only came back one time. Pizza is great when you order a whole, but the last two times the pizza has been soggy and inedible. Stick to the originals when you order."}
{"text":"Early dinner today - the place was practically empty.  Seated quickly.  Waitress was good.  I hadn't had a sandwich in a while.  Couldn't wait to dig in.  I got a turkey-egg-cheese (no slaw), hubs had a pastrami-egg-cheese (naked).  Both were great.  Not as many fries as I remember, but that's ok.  Will go back for sure.  View of the Waterfront at the window is nice."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers: What hasn't been said? Nothing really, so I'll just jump in with my two cents. 

It's a great place to take people from out of town because 1. They always want to go here and 2. The food is decent and the atmosphere is entertaining. Those of us that live here, myself included, are understandably desensitized to the fact that all their sandwiches are topped with coleslaw and fries, but think about it: that's exactly the kind of bizarre and inventive combination that makes something as boring as a sandwich exciting.

And I love watching my friends wrestle with the behemoths (\"Is it shameful if I use a fork?!\") when they first get plopped down all bundled up in butcher paper with no instructions, explanations or apologies. I've tried the slaw and fries by themselves, and can safely say that you should stick to the sandwiches; the chili is a waste of time too.

The staff's attitude--brisk without being mean--is another big selling point. The row of old ladies behind the counter cooking up these monstrous creations laugh in a way that says, \"We're laughing at you, not with you,\" as you tear into those first giant bites. It's both a little embarrassing and charming. When I stopped in at 10 a.m. once the first thing the waiter asked me after I was seated was, \"Ready for a beer?\" It's the Pittsburgh experience-revel.

I've heard people complain that they're not as good as they used to be. I honestly don't know how they used to be, but here and now they're a pretty good sandwich, and yes they're famous, and yes the Strip location always has a million tourists under foot, but people from out of town don't mind fighting crowds-they're expecting it. 

If you hate the wait (or you're just a hungry drunk) you can always take advantage of the fact that they're open 24 hours and show up at 2 am., or 3 a.m., or...you get the idea."}
{"text":"I can't recall the last time I wanted to like a place as much as I wanted to like Primanti Bros. Saw them on several Food Network shows including Drive Ins, Diners and Dives and was totally stoked to eat there. Sadly, I don't get the hype. 

Ordered the recommended pastrami sandwich complete with fries and coleslaw. The bread was delicious but that's where it ended. The fries and coleslaw totally overpowered the pastrami, so much so that I dismantled it and ate the aforementioned components separately. Fries were good but since the place is literally a 10 second walk from the O, considered to have the best fries in the world, I was disappointed. Coleslaw was unremarkable which brings us to the pastrami. Mind you, I was weened on pastrami from several of NYC's best delis so my bar is set fairly high. But even if it wasn't, theirs tasted like shoe leather and I could barely bite through it.

Service was, however, awesome. I just wish I wasn't so disappointed in the food. Maybe when I visit my son in Pittsburgh again I will give them another whirl. But for now, a shake of the head and a sigh. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I personally prefer the strip district, but I was with the family, so we decided to try a more family friendly environment.  Sandwiches were just as delicious, they have a kids menu, and the environment was family conducive."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. Nobody's meal including the kids was seasoned to satisfaction. The pizza tasted like cardboard and the fries were burnt. The table was dirty and the waitress was impatient. The changing table was even dirty in the bathroom. I use to like this location, but now you'll have to pay me to return. Overall Primanti Brothers offers good food, especially the subs. I would just avoid this location."}
{"text":"This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  

The restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me."}
{"text":"Late night snack, steak egg and cheese please..."}
{"text":"It's a Pittsburgh classic but the fried on it didn't do it for me. I would still give them another shot if I went back. The service was great and they had a great selection. I would've preferred the fries if they were more crisp and less thick."}
{"text":"When I saw that the sandwhich came with potatoes and cole slaw I assumed that meant on the side.  I was suprised to find when my sandwich arrived that really meant french fries and slaw on the sandwich.  It was even more surprising to find that the combination of fresh delicious pastrami, tomatoes, cole claw and french fries between 2 large slices of french bread could be so pleasantly mouth watering.  Good job Primanti Bros!  I like your unique style."}
{"text":"Food is usually excellent, just don't come in when the bartender's friends are there. You'll wait a lifetime for drinks, food, anything. Took me an hr and ten minutes to get food to go."}
{"text":"YAWN!   The last thing the Waterfront needed was another substandard local chain - Primanti's.   They have turned their sandwiches into all fries and coleslaw and no meat.   Too bad a great local restaurant (Gran Agave) had to be sacrificed for this.    We won't be going here and hope others feel the same way.    They rely on their name more and more while the quality is always poor.   We have been to a number of their restaurants and are usually disappointed.   We won't be eating here."}
{"text":"In town for a surprise visit - had to make this stop! 

As always!! Great food! Great service! Great price! Awesome atmosphere! 

I don't think there has ever been a time that we have visited and not had a great visit!! 

BF had the fish primanti sandwich and I had the chicken sandwich - ordered cheese and bacon fries to share and took food home!! And sodas!! 

All that (with tip) $35!! 

I so miss this place! We live in FL but need to head to Miami to hit those locations!!"}
{"text":"Had the second best seller which was really good.   A nice carb coma from the italian bread and fries.  A great mix of salty from the meat and those aforementioned fries with the sweet from the slaw!  

The service was good so why only three stars?  Well, when your choice was seeing the stories on their televisions about our enemy murdering defenseless journalists or some show about naked people living off the land...kind of stifles the appetite and not appropriate for even the most casual of dining!   I would have expected better from the hipsters running the joint."}
{"text":"must visit while visiting Pittsburgh. recommended by a local, good food, surprising,"}
{"text":"Sorry but I really don't get all the hype.  I used to live in Philly and now there's a place that knows how to do a sandwich. I still haven't found anything comparable in Pittsburgh, and Primanti's was definitely a disappointment after all the hype.  I've unfortunately been here a few times since guests who visit want to go after hearing the hype, despite my warnings and protests, and each time it continues to disappoint.  At least they now serve beer, which helps somewhat. And the staff have always been friendly.

Now I get that the fries and coleslaw on a sandwich is a Pittsburgh thing, but it simply isn't good.  And do you have to make EVERY SINGLE SANDWICH that way? Is there no room for creativity?  Can't it just be a Pittsburghy add-on option for those interested? Also, I tried asking for my fries and coleslaw on the side the first time I went and was told that it was not the Pittsburgh way and that it could not be done.  And the fries aren't even that good.  They are rather soggy and flavorless, though I did really enjoy the coleslaw.  More importantly, the meats are pretty dry and flavorless and they are all served on this overly thick dry soft white bread that doesn't seem to have a toasting or heating option, which would make their sandwiches so much better.  I know it's supposedly homemade but I think the bread is just gross. How about some french or italian rolls?

Oh and don't ever order the cheesesteak and expect it to be anything like a Philly steak.  It's disgusting and an abomination to call itself a cheesesteak.

I was going to try their breakfast sandwiches sometime thinking maybe those might be different, but then I found out they don't open until 10am.  Why have breakfast and not open until 10am?  Then I saw on here that they put coleslaw and fries even on their breakfast sandwiches, so I give up.

Also, the seating area tends to get cramped and dirty, especially at busy times.  They didn't really seem to clean the tables that frequently after other people left.  And the sandwiches seem overpriced for what they are.  I just don't get why this is considered a Pittsburgh staple when there's such better food in this town.

I'm only giving this two stars because the staff were friendly and helpful and service is quick."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment all around. We were starving and had heard great things about this place but unfortunately the service was extremely slow, and the food was bad (except for the tater tots which are pretty much impossible to mess up). We had the steak sandwich Primanti style and a bowl of chili and thoroughly regretted both decisions. We are not picky eaters and I rarely give 2 stars but I discourage any fellow out of towners from trying this place."}
{"text":"Service is friendly enough but this place is WAY overpriced and crowded. The food is ok, but there isn't anything terribly special, it is frankly quite a bit overrated as well as being overpriced."}
{"text":"They serve their food on paper plates with plastic utensils. I had a hard time cutting my meat. You have to use cash only but they have an ATM inside. I do not like my fries on my sandwich too soggy. Unique but not impressed with sandwich. I would not go again - once was enough. Do not get the hipe with this one."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE PRIMANTI BROTHERS! And this is coming from a person who is not a fan of sandwiches. Been here about 3 times for lunch during my 3 week stay in Pittsburgh. The Pitts-burger was amazeballs! I was told that it was better with eggs included but I actually prefer it sans eggs.  I tried the Capicola & Cheese as well which was also pretty good but the Pitts-burger was just remarkably delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great.  A Pittsburgh staple.  However, I would definitely recommend the Market Square location.  More beers on tap, nice outdoor seating, better atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"I've developed a new take on vegetarianism, called, \"fuck it on vacationsim.\"  It developed on a recent trip to Hawaii, and I'm glad, because I got to splurge on this on a recent trip to steel town.
 
Had eaten too much at Joes Crab shack 40 minutes earlier and wanted something to take on the plane.  I now wish I'd skipped the crab shack and tried these hot off the grill, because the hot pastrami and corned beef were awesome at 1.5hours later in airport, and 4 hours later in ANOTHER airport.  Sure they got a little soggy and the fries were mush, but it was still good, which means I missed out on something by not getting it fresh.  

Live and learn, now my generally animal fat free belly has something to look forward to if I ever get to Pittsburgh again.

I wish I had realized they were serving these at the Pirates Park.  I saw no food of interest and only had beer... not even yuengling, just some other crap."}
{"text":"It was alright. I had the roast beef sandwich with all the toppings: slaw, cheese, and fries. It was good but not as good as many try and make it out to be. Definitely different. I also had wings and beer and those items were great.  Also, it's a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since Ive been here but Im sure it hasn't changed much.
I remember we would go to Pittsburgh to hang out, drink and then one day a friend said we've gotta go to Primanti's.  It's so good.  they put fires and slaw on the sandwiches.  HUH?!?!?  I despise soggy bread and the thought of runny slaw (like kfc) being on my sandwich grossed me out.  But after having multiple and probably 3 too many drinks, we ended up here.  Kielbasa double meat plz, no tomatoes.  
Well, the slaw is not runny, it's lightly dressed with vinegar and IDK what else.  I always take off about half of the French Fries and half of the slaw because they can be too much and I just eat them on the side.  
Overall, it is not the best sandwich Ive ever eaten but it is a pretty tasty sandwich, not just when I was tipsy :)
Now....the restrooms on the other hand....ICKY.  Do not go in the basement lol.  Smells like sewer and is just not right down there.  But when you're tipsy, nothing seems that bad :)"}
{"text":"We heard about this thing Pittsburgh is known for, putting fries in sandwiches - I love fries so why not try, right? We went a little crazy, and got the sandwich and loaded fries lol the more the fry the merrier, right??? I didn't love either, which was disappointing. The sandwich had a star, but it wasn't the fries. It was the coleslaw. I thought that made the sandwich more interesting. The fries were fine, but the chili really overpowered everything else. That's all I could taste. I probably won't come back here again, but super glad I give it a try."}
{"text":"Ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and it is a huge portion! Stuffed with fries and greens, yum! Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This location, near the original, pays homage to a Pittsburgh delicacy. Service is what I'd call \"bare essentials\"; they show up, grab you a drink, and take your order, and don't expect much more. But that's fine for a sandwich shop. 
The food itself though has started to taste a bit bland though the bread itself comes from another Pittsburgh icon, Mancini's. 
One cool thing- you don't get plates. Food is served on deli paper. Weird, but easy cleanup. Worth checking out, but I'm not sure if it's as good as it used to be :(."}
{"text":"You can easily see this place is all about  hats easy! No plates, sandwiches served on paper, plastic cups, plastic ware and the menus are on the wall. 

All sandwiches are served with coleslaw, provolone, tomato, fries & your choice of meat. 

Our server was a bit short at first. Seemed like it had been a long day & he was tired. He did end up being a tad nicer for a second but overall not the friendliest service but not the worst I have had. 

The sandwich was ok. Not very much meat in it. I saw a sign that said double meat for $1.99. Might be worth it. 

The fries were the best part to me. I could have eaten a whole lot of them! We asked for extra after our sandwiches came & they were brought out right away which was awesome."}
{"text":"Usually good food for the most part. But, they hide their Chipotle Tabasco because they don't want their customers using it. I usually have to ask for it. Last time I was there my server never brought it, I had to ask another server to bring it."}
{"text":"Service was shitty. Waited half an hour for a drink, after waiting for a waiter for 20 minutes. Food was good. Service was not."}
{"text":"First time at this Pittsburgh original! I was here for a day on business and I wanted to stop by Primanti Brother's for their special sandwiches. I ordered the Pittsburger and it was quite a treat. I asked the server whether I needed to order anything else beside the sandwich and she said the sandwich itself is plenty...and boy was she right!!! The portion was big and definitely filled me up. I love the idea of having fried inside the sandwich...the bread was soft and chewy...just the way I like it. I can definitely see myself come back to Primanti brothers anytime I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great to eat and the service was excellent. Friendly and knowledgeable of their ingredients. Too good not to try! I advise you to get the egg added!!! Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Way back in the 70's they made a great, unique sandwich.  Now they just crank out bland fare.  They put so little meat on them, you can barely taste it.  They offer 'double meat', but it is the amount you should get a regular sandwich.   I don't mean you should get as much meat as some of the ridiculous delis in NYC, but enough to realize there is meat in the sandwich with all the other stuff they pile on.  Definitely, do NOT go to the ones in Mt Lebo or Oakland."}
{"text":"If you go to one Primantis go to this one.  None of the rest really compare to this one.  Not that I love the food, I don't but once in a while I decide that I am intoxicated enough to enjoy a Primantis sandwich."}
{"text":"My boys LOVED their famous sandwich with fried egg, turkey, ham, bacon, cheese, fries and slaw piled on it! Could barely get it in your mouth but It was crazy good and great service too! Easy exit off 76/Pennsylvania Turnpike. Would totally stop in again!"}
{"text":"If you don't like it then you are not made for Pittsburgh :( This isn't foodie territory, this is about instant gratification and eating a really tall sandwich. Cole slaw is a vegetable.

Get the Pittsburgher, i.e. cheesesteak.

Also if you're from out of town you should order an Iron City beer. It tastes like metal and reliving your quarterback glory years."}
{"text":"You cant come to Pittsburgh PA. And not visit this place. I honestly love that they have a vegetarian option. That gives me a reason to visit this place with friends. Now let's get to the nitty gritty. I ordered the black bean sandwich it was good. It lacks tang. So make sure to order a pickle to balance out the carbs. I also put some hot sauce and pow, yum! Always a good experience. Friendly wait staff and go earlier then your normal meal time as this place gets busy. Also definitely a place to walk to not drive to."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype about Primantis. Most of which I don't quite understand. I ended up here late one night on a friday, and then again on a saturday afternoon.  They are cheap, I will give them that. You don't often find a place where you can get a beer and a sandwich for $10.  

The sandwich they advertise as their 2nd best order is not good. Its a sad patty on a sandwich, I would tell nobody to ever order that sandwich. Luckily I asked some friends the next day and got the sirloin steak sandwich with cheese, much better but again for all the hype just go down the street to fatheads."}
{"text":"One night I was watching the Travel channel, they had a show called Top 10 Places to Pig Out.  Of course I paying attention and taking notes :)  When they mentioned Primanti's and Pittsburgh I was like Yes! I'm there!  I could not wait to get my hands on this giant sammich of all sammiches.  My only regret is that I couldn't get it with a Yeungling :( All the more reason to come back!  Ok, so I went here with my host and we decided to strategize.  I got the capicola ham with provolone and he got the steak and cheese.  We got two sammiches and two cokes for $16, what a deal! We were supposed to share but ended up downing our own sammiches. I forgot to ask if the coleslaw was sweet before I ordered so I was a little worried, not a fan of sweet coleslaw.  Luckily, it was great! 
Here's the nitty gritty.  The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread.  They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting).  It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary.  The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.  The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better.  At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar!  Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven.  Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse...ssshh! Needless to say I devoured this bad boy and desperately needed a nap afterwards.    I came. I saw. I ate.

p.s. You can get it topped with a fried egg! I didn't see that on the menu until I was leaving! doh! next time!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for pulling off a sandwich that tasted as good as I thought it would be, even though I had serious reservations that it could be pulled off... 

I mean, the bread was thick and the steak was smashed, but the fries and Cole slaw just clicked! I enjoyed it enough to have another one at PNC Park later that night.

The only unfortunates were that it's really touristy now ( hence the reason I even knew of the place ) and we had to wait outside in extreme heat before getting a table, and there was no AC and I was having some serious heat sickness going on due to the fact that we weren't beneath a ceiling fan.

But I'll be back for the sandwich. I have no doubts."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  The waitress and I use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  Then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  When she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the burger meat is like a meat loaf. The fries taste burnt. All sandwiches are on thick white bread. If you were just coming for a beer maybe it would be better."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best, and the messy-ness around the kitchen was a turn-off. Went to Pitt for a week-end and everyone recommended Primanti sandwiches. So I was soo looking forward to the meal. 
It took 45 minutes to get the sandwiches, the server screwed up everyone's order and wasn't apologetic when they forget to serve us our fries. I had the Pastrami and Cheese and my wife had the pittsburgher cheese steak. Not a fan of the slaw in the sandwich and our whole table (4 of us) wished we ate somewhere else. I would of rated higher if the service wasn't as bad. But overall not a memorable sandwich and will not recommend to others. Sorry Everyone!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to a clean place: don't come here.
If you mind seeing fingerprints in your bread: don't come here.
If you wan't an amazing sandwich filled with pittsburgh history and tastiness: come here.
If you want a pittsburgh experience: come here.
If you are watching your weight: don't come here.

I love this place. Not healthy in the least, but you get awesome food with friendly people. If you are a tourist, you have to come here."}
{"text":"the service was friendly but SLOW .. went with my nephew's PeeWee hockey team for dinner b/4 a game at the nearby ice complex .. was assured by the waitress there was more than enough time (2 hours to kill) to fill individual orders from the menu w/so many people in our party despite asking if pizza for the group would be more efficient .. the sandwiches took nearly an hour to come out & most were cold after sitting while others were made .. the cook needs to know what SALT is .. my sandwich was tasteless until I added salt & even after that it was not much better .. most of the boys barely touched their meal which their parents had to pay full price for b/4 heading back to the rink .. if they cannot handle large parties they should not seat them .. never again .. too bad since we will be at that rink a lot .. will seek team meals elsewhere"}
{"text":"Harsh, difficult environment, food not worth it. No system of seating, difficult staff. The 'famous' sandwiches are nothing special. Don't give in to the hype, do yourself a favor and find a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Whenever I come back to Pittsburgh I always try to come back to this place. Ambiance is great, food is fast, and the sandwiches are great. If your looking for some greasy meat and fries on delicious Mancini bread you can't beat it !"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is good and the food is great. I like this location over others because I feel like it is not as crowded as the other locations."}
{"text":"I know Primanti's is a major Pittsburgh favorite but I personally am not a fan of coleslaw so I don't really like them! I know some people will think I'm crazy! Fans love the fries and coleslaw on the sandwich. I opted for the Caribbean Chopped Salad which was fine but not something l'll be dying to come back for. Pretzel app basket comes with nacho cheese and 2 different types of mustard. The pretzels were nice because they weren't fried and actually not bad. 

Our server was quick and polite. Prices pretty cheap. Three of us are for $40 including 4 beers (during happy hour). Cleanliness was average with nothing terrible but we did walk through spilled fries to our seat on the way in. 

The atmosphere is nothing special and just reminds me of any chain restaurant. There is nice patio seating though, TVs with sports on and lots of beer options. 

If you love the sandwiches or think you might, then definitely check it out, otherwise, I think there is better places to eat."}
{"text":"Oh so good and huge! Each sandwich is both tasty and large enough to feed two normal folks for lunch.

At the suggestion of the server, I ordered the Kolbassi Sandwich. It came fast and was oh so good! Also free soda refills.

Service was good mid afternoon on a weekday, and I enjoyed the whole experience watching the NFL Hall of Fame induction ceremony on the flatscreens while eating."}
{"text":"This was the first place in Oakland my boyfriend and I ate because of their reputation. Definitely Pittsburgh food. High calorie, fried deliciousness. I had the Pitts-burger and my boyfriend had the roast beef and cheese. We also ordered the small town street fries. We went during the mid afternoon hours so it was pretty empty. The guy serving us was good at picking up we were first timers and explained the menu to us. The food tasted great and it was a big serving...enough for us to take to go boxes and finish it later. We love primanti bros. Will be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  After hearing all the hype I was expecting more.  I hear the one in Pittsburg is better so maybe I should have tried that one.  Food was mediocre at best.  Good service."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are giant, the atmosphere is good. I was there while the Steelers were on, so it was festive.
I agree they are a little dry...so get hot sauce, or ask for some mayo or ranch, ect...
And it was quite warm in there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had a little mishap and were seated out of order, but they made it up to us with any drinks of our choice....forgiven! Otherwise, all items we tried we amazing! And, portions-not even a question. Highly recommend this place. However, be prepared to wait in line this place is that good but worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. After all the hype, it was a little disappointing that this restaurant had been ok so many food network shows. 

We had the pittsburger and salami. The burger was a spongey frozen like patty. And the salami was actually pretty flavorful. 
The slaw was so great. I can see why they put it on every sandwich! But I had to remove the fries. They just weren't seasoned enough and the thick cut potato taste was dominating the sandwich. 

I probably would not return if I lived near. But it was a great experience for a tourist to say I was here!"}
{"text":"Overhyped?  Over-televised?  Yes and yes.  However, they still make a very unique, bad-ass sandwich.

Let it be known that I don't really like cole slaw.  Nonetheless, I liked their slaw atop my mountain of a sandwich.  And how can you go wrong topping anything with fries?   

Fun place with a fun menu and good sandwiches.  

It isn't the Best Food in the Universe, so some folks who build the place up in their mind after seeing it 14 times on the food channel are bound to be disappointed.  But if you take it for what it really is...  Well, you should walk out happy."}
{"text":"Massive Sandwhich of great proportions!  Service was super friendly and the atmosphere of this place  was mad chill.  You can't leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"The place is what is suppose to be!!  A bar/ pub with good food and drinks. Unfortunately was during working hours so I could not try the drinks. The bear list looked good. The  sandwiches were great  but loaded with extra stuff as eaten here in Pittsburgh. Huge portions and tons of calories. I was there for a business meeting with someone out of town. She loved the lunch. I though it was good and I picked the turkey and the co worker ate the black beans. Both were as expected and were served on a wax paper. They gave us bags to take home. The cost is average. The only problem was the smell of burning oil and  I assume  the ventilation. I smell fried food on my clothes for the rest of the day. I will go back for a relaxed dinner with drinks."}
{"text":"This place oozes Pittsburgh. Unhealthy food and lots of beer. All in all, a decent experience. I loved the sports pub atmosphere. I thought the food was just ok. I think I was looking to be blown away by the flavors of the french fries in the sandwich, but I was unimpressed. If I am going to eat something THAT unhealthy, I want it to blow me away. Sounded amazing in theory."}
{"text":"Great Pittsburgh institution.  Had the fried bologna sandwich, took some of the fries and slaw off though. Very good"}
{"text":"This place happy hour is amazing!! And try the kielbasa and Chz add a egg!! Omfg it was amazing.. this city is a foodie.. so with this place I say share all food.."}
{"text":"On our way back from the Georgia, we made a stopover in Pittsburgh.  We wanted to try something special to the Pittsburgh area and settled on Primanti Brothers with this location in Market Square. 

There's a bunch of Primanti Brothers in the Pittsburgh and surrounding area and they are all known for their sandwiches.  Big fat sandwiches of deli meats stacked on freshly cut grilled Italian bread slathered with coleslaw and french fries in one single easy (well not so easy) to eat package!  In fact the original Primanti Brother's idea was to make an all in sandwich that workers can eat in one hand.

In have to admit I can see why they are so popular and are a local institution.  The freshly hand cut bread is grilled and stuffed with meat, coleslaw and fries which is in fact a delicious combo!  All sandwiches are served in paper wrap as no knives, forks or even plates are given!

We really enjoyed our meal here and next time we are in the area we would definitely be back for more.

Well done Primanti Brother's!  You are my kids second favorite brothers after the Mario Bros now!  Haha!"}
{"text":"Just tried. The pastrami and cheese sandwich.  It was good not great. Just wasn't  great."}
{"text":"These are some good sandwiches.  We had the New Yorker and it reminded me of the big Apple! What a crazy connection. My son, Dirk, had the Capone and he felt really good about it. He hated the cole slaw. Some of the floor was slippery from smudged fries but it added to the atmosphere. Try it and enjoy a fry sandwich!"}
{"text":"Yeah I really don't get it. I've tried it twice so far but each time I am unmoved and longing to be eating something else. I'll still take friends here because it is a Pittsburgh fav, but other than that..no thanks."}
{"text":"I was excited to go here as Primanti Bros. is a staple of Pittsburgh according to my family and friends who live there. Unfortunately, my first experience at one was not very good.

We stopped here on our way to the airport and luckily left ourselves plenty of time as our food took FOREVER to come out. It was around 45 minutes from the time we ordered until we actually got our food. Pretty ridiculous for a few sandwiches and a salad. Our server was very attentive and apologized many times so I'm not exactly sure what happened to cause the delay.

As for the food, it was fine but it did not meet my (admittedly high) expectations. I ordered the Sicilian cheesesteak and it was good enough, but nothing special. It came with a side of fries which were pretty pedestrian as well.

Although the service was good, the rest of my experience here doesn't exactly have me itching to go back to Primanti Bros. anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Wings ok. Specials/ happy hr. Good. 
Dry sandwich for being the catch/goto item... guess I like a toasted \"melty cheese\" crunchy bread kinda samich.. 
all in all.. 
I go back on occasion. Not a regular but if your thinking about going and haven't been?!? ya gotta try It!
if only for the hype o the sandwich"}
{"text":"When I told people I was going to Pittsburgh, everyone recommended Primanti Bros. I went and was underwhelmed. It was a big sandwich, but the flavour was not amazing. I also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me. As a Chicago native, I feel it's the equivalent of people recommending Giordano's or Portillo's. They're not exactly the greatest places in town, but they're well-known and popular for one reason or another. Do it just to say you did.

I don't like coleslaw."}
{"text":"Giant sandwich!  With fries!

There's nothing about this place that won't be unexpected, but each ingredient is so good that you won't care.  It's a big sloppy eat-a-thon.  And you will foodcoma."}
{"text":"GROSS!!! Many people told me to go here and I was totally disappointed! It was bland, the coleslaw was too tangy (and only contained cabbage) and the meat was scary! Good thing it's super cheap. Do NOT get the cheese-steak sandwich if you go even though it says #2 best seller, it's awful! 

Okay on to service... Everyone seemed like they hated their job. Someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onions.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day... Who knows."}
{"text":"I had never had a Primanti sandwich. It did not disappoint. The Cap & Cheese sandwich really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Expect what you read from other reviews. Yes everything comes with fries and coleslaw, and yes, it will do significant damage to your body immeidately upon consumption. Will you enjoy it? Probably. It's super cheap, food comes out pretty fast, and one thing is for sure... you won't be hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Filth. If you like this stuff, you have the palette of a pig and you should be fed in a trough.

The standards met here are so incredibly low, it literally qualifies as \"I'm so hungry I'll eat anything\". And at Primantis, that's what you get -- a sandwich that tastes and feels like it was dipped in a toilet before you got it. Just the thought is sickening.

I've had drunk food in State College, Philadelphia, parts of Jersey, parts of North Carolina, Atlanta and Orlando and I've never had worse than Primanti Bros. They do nothing right."}
{"text":"It gets the job done. Consistently good sandwiches, low price, fast service. This is the original Primanti's, and the one featured on food network. Love the pastrami sandwich.

It's also located right on the strip, so you can check out some other places if you go during the day. Has it's own parking lot.

Gotta say the people working there are a bit curt, not the friendliest. Menu doesn't have much variety, but it is a sandwich shop after all.

will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Was only okay... burger is the type of one you would expect when they don't ask for a temperature to cook-okay but not great. Sandwich needed some pizzazz...meat tasted great but got lost in all the layers of flavor suckers-fries, slaw, bun, etc. We loved the hometown feel but it was not the cleanest place-garbages overflowing, etc."}
{"text":"I just don't get the appeal. I know it's a Pittsburgh thing, but the appeal is lost on me. The place is dirty, there's no service to speak of, and my sandwich was extremely under-seasoned and bland.

They misunderstood our order, made me wait at the bar for them to take 6 orders until they agreed to fix it, and they forgot our side of fries. No apology, no \"please sit down and we'll bring it to you\", nothing. We had a roast beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich. The pastrami was better, but both were bland and the fries inside were unsalted and undercooked. Would not return, and don't recommend."}
{"text":"I am born-and-raised Pittsburgher. I hate Primanti's sandwiches. I just...can't.

But I do enjoy Primanti's booze specials! Especially when they have Woodchuck specials and give me a glass for every drink I purchase. That happened like 2 years ago though but I still enjoy their alcohol game whenever I go in once or twice a year. 

The waitstaff here are OK. Seem to be a lot of RMU college kids who hate their lives - that type doesn't make amazing waitstaff. The service time is average. The booze time is fast which is always a winner to me. 

The appetizers are my go-to. They aren't super special but the batter dipped pickles were good. I want some original apps - wow me, Primanti's! 

Pecan pie was good."}
{"text":"Got the Pitts-burger, nothing that blows you away, but it was no a normal burger for sure. Worth a trip if your in pitt for a visit."}
{"text":"I wouldn't imagine going anywhere else when we are in town. Yum! I dream of these sandwiches when I'm back home in VA. This is a total must for visitors and locals alike. The jumbo fish sandwich is our typical order but there's not a thing on the menu I wouldn't order. Seriously...go there. Just be prepared to get a little messy. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This was obviously a must on my trip to Pittsburgh to stop in at the original Primanti Bros. Holy moly I was not disappointed. We were seated very quickly which was impressive because they were slammed. Once we were seated our waiter was very friendly and our food came out quickly. Between the two of us we shared the Smallman Street Fries and the Capicola sandwich. I'm so glad we split them because it was an enormous amount of food and even splitting it we couldn't finish everything. It was incredibly delicious and a great nostalgic feel going to the original location. Will definitely be stopping here on my next trip to PGH!"}
{"text":"I was visiting some friends in Pittsburgh and they took me here to make sure I was getting the full experience. I like to make sure I try the staple food of every major city I go to, so this was the spot, apparently. I got the Pittsburger, obviously, and it was...interesting. Although I can't say it was too creative (it was basically just like taking everything on your plate and putting in between bread), but it wasn't bad. Not the best thing I've ever tasted, far from it, but wasn't bad.

The place had a rough-around-the-edges feel, which I think was perfect because I see Pittsburgh as that kind of city. Service was fine, too, and prices were nothing to complain about. If I lived in the area, I could see myself coming back here. I'd definitely recommend stopping through if you're just visiting."}
{"text":"Good happy hour deals, Interesting burgers for a Southerner like me. seems to be a local favorite. 

If your trying to cut calories don't go. 

If you like comfortable burger and fries Do go!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to eat here since I saw this on Man v Food. Started with the nachos which were delicious. Next on to the sandwiches which we ordered the pastrami and cheese, the beef and cheddar and the Pittsburgher. The pastrami was very good as was the beef sandwich. The pittsburger which they call their number 2 best seller was nasty. Also the cole slaw is very sour and not my favorite. The fries they get right. Just needed a little salt and they were excellent. On the side of service it was good just took a while for the sandwiches and it wasn't packed. I'm glad I went and would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's cheap and delicious. 

My husband and I split the capicola and cheese sandwich with a side of fries and it was more than enough for the two of us. We barely finished the sandwich let alone the delicious fries. In love with the coleslaw on the sandwich. Just so much deliciousness!

Only drawback is that it's cash only. However, the ATM up front only has a $2 fee instead of the usual $3 you find at most places."}
{"text":"Fresh-made sandwich by a guy/gal behind the counter. Pick your meat and style from a long list of options, and you get a HUGE helping of fries and slaw stuffed inside the thing itself. All that goodness for way under $10? This is a Pittsburgh legend, no two ways about it. The Oakland one is good for convenience (thinking about the college crowd here), and service is friendly. Sure you can nitpick about the quality and cleanliness of the place, but you're not here for fine dining. You're here to load up on some cheap eats to stave off that winter chill."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the Pittsburgh staple for the first time but ended up being disappointed. The fries in my sandwich were cold and soggy. They clearly were not freshly prepared. I got the pastrami and it's not really top notch deli quality. It could have used mustard, too. Still I'm happy I got a chance to try, and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out...buffalo chicken salad. The chicken was hard and cold. Dont waste your money on this, sorry I did!"}
{"text":"Food Network tourist trap is what I thought before I came here.  It may be that but it's also damn good!  We were in town for a Pirates game(we go to a few different stadiums each year) and wanted to try this place out.  Of course we had to go to the original. Being a good diner, I had scoped out the menu 1st online and kept seeing \"our #2 seller\" but never seeing number one.  So like any dumbass tourist, we asked what the number one seller was and she said \"the beer\".  I may as well have been wearing a fanny pack and a hawaaiin shirt at that point.  

I ordered the pastrami sandwich and Yuengling.  The beer was cold and pastrami was hot!  In case you don't know about Pirmanti's, the sandwich is an entrie meal.  It comes with what ever sammich you pick and then cole slaw and fries are on the sammich itself.  It's huge.  Sounds like a novelty but it works.  The crazy thing about it is it's only like 6.88 for this ginormous meal.  

There are about 50 different combinations of this sandwich and if I lived close, i'd try them all."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is a top take in Pittsburgh every time my wife and I visit.  We have been a few times and plan on going back every time we visit Pittsburgh.  I plan on trying a different main ingredient on my sandwich every time.  Despite being real busy all the time they are very friendly and the service is always great.  I cant wait to try the Capicola and egg next visit."}
{"text":"Every time I return to Pittsbirgh, I come here. Every time, I get the same thing. Sardine and cheese with an egg. Always fresh and satisfying. Very affordable. The staff is also friendly."}
{"text":"The concept of a gigantic sandwich piled high with coleslaw and fries sounded absolutely disgusting to me and i really wasn't sold on the concept.  And i really didn't get it until i took that amazing first bite of my \"cheese steak\" (I use this word loosely.  It really is more like a burger).  Who could have thought it'd be so tasty!  I was scared that i wouldn't be able to get it in my mouth, but the nice soft bread made it possible.  

Each part of the sandwich was good by itself.  The coleslaw was very tangy but also sweet and the fries were very tasty.   Overall it ended up being a fantastic experience and something i will crave frequently."}
{"text":"Kosher Pigswich with Dickfries and Ballzslaw!!!

Ladies and Gents, to comprehend what I am about to lay upon you I feel it's only right that I paint a picture of the womb from whence it came.
 
Welcome to Da Burgh, Ahhrn City --An old east coast city in Southwestern Pennsylvania, situated on the hills and valleys carved out by the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela.  It rains a good deal here.  The city was built by many Eastern Europeans, some Italian, and some German immigrants who worked their asses off in the steel mills years ago.  Currently, Pittsburgh is much less blue-collar, but it still maintains much of rough blue-collar charm.  People here are genuine, love their football, beer, cigarettes (Marlboros and Camels not Parliament Lights), and facial hair (usually unkempt ones with neck beardage or the cookie duster mustaches often popular with middle-aged men with last names ending in \"ski\".)

Only out of a city such as Pittsburgh, could the Primanti Bros. Sandwich become a legendary food.

A Primanti Bros. Sandwich starts with thick slice of homemade bread, then the usual suspects of meats, cheeses, french fries are put on top, and then sweet & sour slaw is slung on top of that, and finally a tomato, and another piece of thick homemade bread.  The entire creation is plopped down flimsy piece of cooking parchment and shoved across the counter your way.  It's a huge toppling sloppy mess.  The only way to fit the damn thing in your mug is too smash it down before you bite in.  Whatever your modus operandi for eating a Primanti, there just ain't a way to eat it with dignity and still eat it right.

If you're having trouble visualizing this, check out their website. Besides their city menu has the #2 best seller indicated and yet oddly enough absolutely no mention whatsoever of the #1 or #3? primantibrothers.com

The true yinzer sandwich option that I recommend is the Kolbassi and Cheese.  The Kolbassi is split open and dropped into the fryer.  Yes, a deep fried sausage topped with cheese, fries, and slaw.  The grease just glistening from the singed flesh as it absorbs into the thick white bread (dignity is overrated anyway). Make sure yinz warsh it dahn wit ah cold ahhrn city, en'at.  (translation: Make sure you wash it down with a cold Iron City Beer and that.)

Primanti Bros. is definitely not diet food, but most definitely a 100% genuine Pittsburgh food.  It is disgusting in all the right ways.

I leave you with the apt lyrics of South Carey. \"Where they don't pour steel, but the kids are real. But why do they all have beards (beers)? It's Pittsburgh, Go Steelers Pittsburgh.\""}
{"text":"Same ol' Primanti Bros. Nice and close location. Fries & Slaw on the Sam'ich, what's not to like?  Friendly staff. Quick service. I will say with all the TVs everywhere, the vibe is super sports bar. Which is fun... sometimes! Not a great place to have dinner with the family if what you want to do is TALK ('member that?) Ask to sit far away from the bar if you want to actually focus on your companions, not on the score. Great place to hang out when the Home Team's on!"}
{"text":"I came up for a Ravens/Squeelers game and my friend took me here because it was a Pittsburgh landmark. I am not one that normally complains about how clean a restaurant is, but this place was a little grimy. It was literally as if nobody cleaned the restaurant all day. Not one wipe down of a table, push of a broom... nothing. I had a sandwhich with a bunch of random stuff on it, it was ok but nothing special. I give this place a pity three stars since i guess it is the only \"special\" food spot that Pittsburgh has. Yes, sad... i know.

**Edited to say that i dont think that i went to this location... i went to the one by Pitt."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was slow. Its a chain so it is pretty consistant.  The chili is worth ordering and I always like the Pittsburger. The wings are ok not great."}
{"text":"Great salads too! Also the chili. Another good thing about Primanti's, as soon as it is time for face off all the TV's are tuned to the Pen's game."}
{"text":"A bit light on the slaw but satisfied my fix. Chili great as always. Roast beef had considerable fat which I never have had dealt with before at any Primanti shop.
Still, I will see you in a few months when I make it back here. Wish we did more work out here is nice area but for the traffic!"}
{"text":"At the suggestion of a friend, I tried this place. For less than $8 (including tax and tip), I tried the classic sandwich, which is beef (cut like you would for cheesesteak), fries, and coleslaw all in one sandwich. Aside from the flavor of the coleslaw, the sandwich was tasteless. The fries weren't seasoned, the coleslaw was good, and the meat was bland. Coming from Texas, I do expect beef to be somewhat salted and peppered. In addition, the normal grocery store bread couldn't hold the sandwich altogether, so as you ate, the sandwich fell apart. Although the sandwich was ready in less than five minutes (guess it's not cooked to order), I won't return!"}
{"text":"yes.

Duuuuuuuude. This place. I don't have words. We went there on recommendation from friends in Chicago, where we live, and don't regret it. I only regret not getting some of that crazy-good bread and coleslaw to go.

For those unfamiliar, the coleslaw they put on every sandwich is NOT made with mayo. It's the Italian way with oil/vinegar/sugar and it's freaking delicious. Like, I ate every little, tiny stringy piece of it. And french fries on my sandwich? Like really? UHmazing.

It's really not as grease-pit as some might think. Yeah, triple grilled cheese. Yeah, french fries on my sandwich. But they put fewer fries on your sandwich than you'd normally eat if you ordered them on the side. So don't get all \"fattening, blah blah blah\" on me and turn up your nose to this joint.

It's amazing and I love it and I want them to expand to Chicago. Tomorrow."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding. Mozzarella was great. But never having been before I was looking for a burger.  I did not get a burger. It was some type of mixed patty, tasty but not what I expected."}
{"text":"Decent Pittsburgh style sandwiches. I got the pastrami and it was a huge sandwich, and the fries inside the sandwich were a nice touch, but I don't think this is a destination spot at all. It's a definitely must go to in Pittsburgh, but I wouldn't go normally if this was down my street."}
{"text":"I saw this place on one of those food channel shows.  I ordered the house special burger with the slaw and fries piled on sour dough bread.  It might taste great after a night on the town, but this was lunch time and it wasn't doing it for me."}
{"text":"I thought this was the perfect way to end a whole day at the history Center. I had the cheese combo, my boyfriend the Pittsburger and my friend the bacon and cheese. All came out fast and we're delicious recipes. The concept is definitely different. I opted for my fries and coleslaw on the side which worked better for me but I can see the appeal. Will definitely do again."}
{"text":"If you come up here from out of Pittsburgh, get the primanti sandwich.  It is Pittsburgh's sandwich.  The service here is absolutely amazing.  Our waiter today was extremely friendly, and the food came in about ten minutes-and there were five other people with me!  If you don't want the primanti sandwich, the menu has so many more great things to offer.  The burgers are delicious, the pizza is good, and there are the chicken wings. They personally weren't my favorite as even the mild buffalo sauce was really spicy. But get the primanti sandwich.  I got bacon and cheese, but the coleslaw wasn't my favorite.  But don't give that a negative idea.  I know lots of people who say it's the best coleslaw ever.  I think it's a great place to eat, it's a combination of every restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just what you'd expect from a Pittsburgh staple. Don't be a snob. It's good."}
{"text":"\"Hi! One Pastrami sandwich please. The way it comes, yes. It can pay my bills, walk my dog, do my laundry & change my oil for me can't it?\"

The classic primanti brothers sandwich is the Wunderkid, the Ubermensch of American sandwiches. There's nothing else like it in the world. And, the Carson Street location is cozy & very Southside to me (being a newb to the area). 

Be sure to order it however they want to give it to you. I mean, d'you come all this way to Pittsburgh (or, if in Pittsburgh...d'you go through that hellish traffic) to say, \"please leave the fries on the side?\" 

Come on now...live a little. And, really, this sandie is cheap! Man, Pittsburgh proves again it knows how to roll. 

There should just be a doctor on every corner across from Primantis...just in case...and it'll keep folks coming back for more b/c they'll have the security the doc is right there!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can add anything too original for a review of primantis. If you're a primantis regular, you're not reading this.  Order the classic cheesesteak primantis is known for and don't ask for without French fries or coleslaw.  Enjoy!  It's both overrated and underrated kind of like Penn State's white away uniforms which won best and worst uniform one year from ESPN!"}
{"text":"If you have to get something other than the famous cheese steak with fries and coleslaw then order their pizza, it's under-rated."}
{"text":"If you like greasy fries on an otherwise delicious salad, you will LOVE it. Despite rave reviews and the fact that this no-longer-novel idea is beloved by many locals, I have to say yuk."}
{"text":"Great place - The Original Primanti's. We went here all of the time after hitting the clubs or local lounges/bars. It's good quality meat, fresh cut fries, a good slaw between two nicely cut slices of Italian Bread. Mind as well be homemade Italian bread because that's what it takes like. 

Mostly we go here after drinking so it REALLY taste good at that time. But still a great place for a sandwich and a beer. Doesn't need a happy hour because it's already cheap."}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh original. They now have several locations including Downtown, West Mifflin, Southside and this location in Mt Lebanon. Primanti's is known for their sandwiches which have coleslaw and French fries ON them. It sounds weird but tastes delicious. You have the crunch of the coke slaw and the saltiness of the fries which gives the sandwiches a lot of flavor. 
Primanti's also has pizza and wings. The pizza is really good with a great balance of cheese and sauce. 
If you are visiting Primanti's is a must try!"}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh tradition. We love to eat there and we love to take visitors there. The sandwiches are huge, piled high with French fries and coleslaw. Since this location is new I decided to try something new. Instead of my regular Pastrami sandwich I ordered a half pound cheeseburger. It came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and 2 slices of American, Swiss, or Provolone. I opted for American. The waitress asked if I wanted Pink or No Pink. I chose Pink. I'm not a fan of well done burgers. It wasn't long before my burger arrived. It was almost if not as big as their sandwiches. My fries, however, were on the side. 
My burger was cooked perfectly but they had forgotten to leave the tomato off as I requested. There side of fries was massive. They were hot and seasoned well. 
The restaurant was super loud. It's normally not that loud but they had the Penguin Playoff game on every tv. They have A LOT of TVs. Everyone had a good view of the game. When the Penguins scored the diners started a chant, \"Let's Go Pens!\"  As I said earlier-Primanti's = hometown. Good food, great service, and all of the local sports teams supported. It's definitely a fun way to watch the game. 
Welcome to the Waterfront, Primanti's!!  We're glad you are here."}
{"text":"Looking for a taste of Pittsburgh? Then this is the place for you. Primanti's is known for it's sandwiches which include coleslaw and fries. The back story is that the steelworkers needed a meal they could take with them but didnt need eating utensils and could even eat with one hand if necessary.  Hence the fully loaded sandwich.
I have eaten the Pastrami, the Corned Beef, the Italian, and a few others. They are all good. The coleslaw adds a nice crunch and the fries bring a saltiness. It is a great combination/bite of food. 
Their wings and their pizza are also good. Everyone in the family can find something on the menu."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this Primantis location. They have locations all over the city. I tend to order the same thing when I go to Primantis. I'm not sure why. I don't know if it's me but it seems every time I go to Primantis the quality of the food seems to go down. Today my bread seemed stale and my fries were cold. It also took quite awhile for our food to come to the table. 
We were at Primantis to meet up with extended family who live out of town/state. Every time they come to town they like to eat here. Most of them ordered the Pittsburgher. They seemed to like their food but I was disappointed.  
Here's hoping for a better experience and better food next time."}
{"text":"My Pittsburgh ex-colleague raved about this sandwich and how she really missed it when we were living in Wisconsin, so when I came to Pittsburgh, I had to try it. 

The concept is great - crispy fries with slaw and soft bread and salty meat, what's not to like? 

Maybe it's because we didn't eat it right away or b/c we crushed the two sandwiches in one bag, the bread was smushed and sandwich a bit soggy. 

I liked the pastrami better than the corned beef. It was a bit big for my mouth so I end up getting a bite of slaw/fries/bread and another bite w/ more meat but no slaw.. I am not sure what can be done to the sandwich to fix the \"small mouth\" issue, but I was sad I couldn't get it all in one bite. 

It was ~$6.50 for each sandwich so pretty cheap meal. The ambiance was really cool and seems like lots of college students. 

Will probably visit again to see if I like it better when it's eaten immediately."}
{"text":"Their signature sandwiches sadly did not live up to the hype for me.

Fries in the sandwich were soggy and not warm, slaw was pretty good, but nothing special. Meat was not high quality. On the plus side- it was cheap and they have some killer beer specials (think miller, yuengling, IC light, ect).

Might be worth dropping in for a quick bite and beer if you're nearby for lunch or have the late-night drunk munchies, but I don't understand how this is a tourist destination."}
{"text":"After leaving a very negative review for another Primanti's location in town, I have to say I'm quite impressed with this one. I went here one week after opening early on a Friday evening. The fries on the sandwiches were crispy and piping hot and the veggie burger seemed like it might actually be made in house? Service was speedy and friendly. Good beer selection and happy to see a full bar as well as a larger menu (items like Pizza and salads). There weren't any sports games on so the crowd wasn't very big which is a shame, because I feel like this Primanti's actually deserves the crowd. Despite being a chain of sorts, it does have a local vibe to it and I feel like it's going to do much better in this location than some of the upscale predecessors in this spot. Hopefully the service and quality holds up when they are busier too. I live nearby so I'm sure I'll be back often- excited to see what they do with the outdoor patio in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Went back, and got the corned beef this time instead of the cheesesteak.  MUCH better!  Also, have them add a fried egg to your sandwich for extra-awesomeness.

{"text":"This place is a straight up 5. RJ and I stopped here at midnight after the Flyers/Penguins Stadium Series. $5 for parking right outside the door. It 
was packed, but another couple had 2 empty seats and offered them to us. The employees bust their butts here, and we got waited on and served right away. I had roast beef and RJ had angus steak. RJ told me there would be French fries and slaw on my sandwich, but I had no idea how good that would be. And I expected a roll or toasted bread. It's served on slices of fresh Italian bread and I just loved the way the cold, fluffy bread absorbed all the flavor from the hot roast beef and fries and cold cole slaw. We also ordered cheese fries because the fries are so good. My only regret is that I didn't ask for cheese on my sandwich, I'll know for next time. But a weird thing. The girl who offered us a seat walked out. Her man friend said to us, I should settle up so you don't get stuck with our bill. Then he disappeared, and we never saw him pay which was right  in front of where we were sitting. We made sure their bill wasn't on our check, which it wasn't. $18 for all of that, and I took half of mine home for the next day and it was still delicious!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious sandwiches.  One of the best pastrami sandwiches we have ever had. The bread is extremely light and the cole slaw is crunchy, which compliments the sandwich well! :). Will most definitely come back when in town again!"}
{"text":"It was fine. Nothing to write home about.  Good for big families who want simple and cost efficient or college students."}
{"text":"We came here to experience the novelty of this place, due to the recent restaurant highlights on the Food Channel. I realize the ambiance is lost out in the suburbs but we wanted to try their massive sandwiches.

I really wished I read the review here before I went, for I ordered the steak and cheese and was really displeased with the texture of the  meat. It resembled the texture of chicken fried steak, which is spongy. The fries were the boardwalk kind and I don't like that. My dining companion ordered the Colossal fish and it was very large. That was a more appropriate texture and it was very crispy and crunchy. I also was not pleased with the thick white bread which really should be toasted or else it just tears apart with the wet components.

Messy messy!"}
{"text":"Being a Pittsburgh native it seems that giving anything below 5 stars would have me shunned. However, don't see how you can give Primanti's much more than 3, 4 at most.

When it comes to the beer selection and the price, you're paying below restaurant average and above dive average which earns P. Bros a star in my book. Good, you notice you can't charge 'Friday's' prices for a Yeungling. 

The sandwiches are where it is at. All the 2 and 1 star sandwich connoisseurs clearly don't know the background behind the sandwich and just don't understand. It's a trucker sandwich. It was made to have the sides you want ON the sandwich so that it wasn't a hassle on the go. 
The slaw is vinegary and not creamy because we are in Pittsburgh after all and a vinegary slaw is krauts cousin and kraut is a common factor in Polish, German, Czech and Slovakian cultures(all big communities in Pittsburgh). The 'coleslaw' at P Bros is easily my favorite part.

Furthermore, with plenty of meat options every sandwich experience is usually different although the Pastrami and the Corned Beef are go to for me. They aren't overly flavorful as you often find yourself adding ketchup and/or Hot Sauce, but over-all still a filling and delicious sandwich. 

I wish they would do-away with the restaurant style P bros and stick to small sandwich joints because that would earn it another star. These places are meant to be basic Pub and Grub not sit down restaurants. All that being said, it's still a must have if you are hungover or drunk, simply good grub."}
{"text":"I ordered a fave of diners, the Pittsburger. cheesesteak.  It's a burger with cheese coleslaw, French fries  all piled between 2 thick pieces of bread. Looked ok.  It, however, didn't work for me. 
The coleslaw was great though!!
It's not much of a cheesesteak. It's a weird burger. That burger seemed like a fried frozen burger. Not much cheese either. 
My crew had the kielbasa sandwich and the ham sandwich respectively. They looked great. 
I don't think fries on my sandwich works for me either. I can't hold it against them though. 
I chose poorly. I think they are probably good though. 
My motto: eat food you recognize."}
{"text":"Having heard from a co-worker originally from Pittsburgh to try PB and the fact that I am a french fry fanatic (see \"Last Meal on Earth\" on profile), I had to make a this a first priority when visiting Pittsburgh for my business trip.  

The friend that I was meeting for dinner had no objections to eating at PB.  This location is a no frills sports bar - plasma screen TVs on the wall, beers on tap, crinkly paper menus, and seat your own self kind of place.  I ordered the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak sandwich ($5.99 and #2 bestseller).  It consisted of a thin burger patty, cheese, coleslaw, tomato, a thick layer of french fries all in between 2 big slices of soft french bread.  

The sandwich came out on just the wrapper - no plates.  I was unsure of how to eat this sandwich that was considerably bigger than my mouth but I finished both halves in one sitting.  My friend was quite impressed by my gluttony especially for a petite person.  I highly recommend this sandwich for the portion, taste, and price.  

My friend ordered and swears by the Ragin Cajun chicken breast sandwich.  According to him, it's not too spicy.  He also ordered a beer from the tap served in the biggest beer glasses I've ever seen.  If you're visiting Pittsburgh, I would suggest that you too, make PB a priority."}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have ever seen. Sooooo rude. She made up rules and last calls as she went. And whined to us about her broken phone. No one cares. Interesting how she said we couldn't get a beer..yet continued to serve other patrons. We weren't drunk. And the ones they were serving were. I'm from out of town and was looking forward to this place. This place sucks. AVOID. The girls are RUDE. Visit another location."}
{"text":"We don't have a Primanti Brothers where I'm from so, while visiting Pittsburgh, I had to swing by and have a sandwich. I can only say that it was surprisingly fantastic. One wouldn't expect a sandwich of fries, beef and coleslaw to be tasty, but in fact it was. A hearty sandwich and a couple cold beers were perfect for this blustery, winter day."}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh institution.  

The Primanti's Sandwich is an absolutely disgustingly huge sandwich with french fries inside.  But boy is it great!  

Take a day off your healthy ways and go there, open your mind and enjoy!!  (and if hungover or looking for food after the bars ... this is your place)"}
{"text":"2 hours from Cleveland to Pittsburgh with tolls and no gas stations to be found...

I came there hungry and with low expectations because hyped up places usually disappoint, which this place did.  I love sandwiches..but this place was all novelty to me.

Bread-tasted like thicker wonder bread
Coleslaw-was bland
Corn beef-I had better
Pastrami-same thing
French fries-unseasoned

All together was filled with carbs and had so much potential, but was so boring. I think everyone should go once just to say they've been to this joint but that's about it. Also, some girl said she could finish a whole sandwich. I am 7 months pregnant and I couldn't finish the whole thing. 

PS. the bathrooms are creepy!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Food was good,quick and beers weren't to bad price wise. After we left we parked out back and sidewalk by back door is a grease pit and my wife slipped. What manager would not see this."}
{"text":"The sandwich was HUGE and full of fresh flavor. The photos show thick crusted, white, bread but it is soft and easy to eat. I was surprised that that fries (which are on the sandwich) aren't soggy. I selected the beef. Only three stars because although it has fresh flavor it's very plain. No spices or fresh herbs makes it a very flat sandwich experience."}
{"text":"Are these bartenders even serious???? Waited over 6 min for a drink from the older blonde lady with a clip in her hair, Jesus. Really (I actually set a timer, bc she was so ridiculous)??? Second drink needed before happy hour was over, nope. Wow. The younger tender to come on was at least more attentive, prompt, fast..... Promise, never again....."}
{"text":"This is a true landmark institution of Pittsburgh!   Trust the way they make their sandwiches and you will have an amazing meal!  I highly recommend going to the original location and it is always open!"}
{"text":"The cook was such a nice guy, plus he wasn't bad looking either. The food was made right in front of you (if you're sitting at the counter), so you know how your food is being prepared. The food is, what it is. Meat, slaw, bread, fries cheese etc. And lots of it. I only ate half of my sandwich. It was ok. Nothing super special. But I was told I had to go there when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We had lunch at the Market Square location yesterday, a Saturday, while on a tour of Pittsburgh. I've had some bad restaurant experiences in my life but this, hands down, was the worst. First, the waiter didn't write down our order. That could be OK if we were a party of two but we were seven. When the order arrived, predictably, it was wrong and missing the 5-year old's chicken tenders which didn't arrive until FIFTEEN minutes later. Three of the sandwich orders were wrong and most were cold. The waiter had to pry the sandwiches apart to tell what they were as he served them. And no knife and fork setups for anyone. My replacement sandwich was warm but the corned beef looked like it like it came from a supermarket deli counter. We also found out that sandwiches topped with french fries and coleslaw are really not a good concept especially when the bread is dry and breaks into pieces when handled. To be fair, Primanti Brothers at my request, comp'ed three sandwiches and when the bill arrived the waiter had also comp'ed the drinks. That gesture, however, could not erase the fact that the best part of the meal was our grateful departure."}
{"text":"Gyro was not as advertised. Not the mound of meat I expected for sure. Was the packaged meat too not like real gyros. Beer was good so not totally disappointed. Busy so maybe I just ordered something I shouldn't have."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on TV and hearing so much from locals, I had such high expectations.   I arrived a little before 11:00, a little early for lunch but too late for breakfast (which, according to the sign, ended at 10:30).   I sat at a table right across from the counter, and ordered a pastrami & cheese and a diet coke.  I got my drink, but my sandwich never made it out.   After almost 20 minutes and seeing several people who came in after me get their food, I got up and went to the counter to ask about my sandwich....for which no ticket could be found.  I was told that they'd get to work on it right away, so I sat back down (nobody EVER came back to check on me once my drink was delivered) to wait.  While I was waiting, I got out my wallet so I could go ahead and pay for it, since I'd been waiting a while, at which time the owner came out and asked me if I was waiting for my check.  When I told him I was still waiting for my food, he proceeded to start yelling at everyone behind the counter, telling them to get my sandwich (which they were already doing).   A couple of minutes later, he brought it to me personally.  

The sandwich itself was a bit of a letdown.  The bread was fresh, but the ingredients were nothing special.  And the whole thing fell apart as soon as I tried to pick it up, so I ended up eating the fries on the side, just like I normally would, instead of as part of the sandwich, as was intended.   I only ate half of it, tossed the other half, and left feeling somewhat let down."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must do while in Pittsburgh.  On a recent trip from Phoenix I wanted to check out a place that showcased history of the \"Burgh\" and this was at the top of my list.  

The food and quality of the items aren't the reason why you come here.  You also don't come to be impressed by the serivice.  The reason is to enjoy a long time staple of this wonderful city.  Where else have you ever heard of a sandwich with cole slaw and fries on it?  If so, I'm sure Primanti's started the idea.

Walking in you feel like you are walking back in time to when the place was first opened.  The decor is quite inviting for the worker/ or family type.  Not really for anyone fancy, but then again this place isn't anywhere near fancy!  

Located in the \"Srip District,\" just a short jaunt from downtown I would tell anyone to pop their head into this place.  To experience history as well as enjoying all of the stores/markets in this area."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Primanti Bros. - I've been coming to Pittsburgh for YEARS - now that I know what I've been missing I feel that my family has really failed me! 

Primanti Bros. knows how to make a friggin sandwich!!  They stack it a mile high with meat, fries, slaw, tomatoes, and so on.  You can hardly put your mouth around the whole thing!  They have a decent selection of brew-skis, the walls are painted with local celebrities, they are open 24-7, the staff is friendly, and they have a great location."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not worth the hype. I went with some old college friends last weekend and felt as if I was treated as a second-class citizen, regardless of the fact that we were all paying customers. When we finally were seated, after waiting in line half of an hour,  we were located right next to the door in the line of a obnoxious  people waiting to sit down and stuff their faces.  Maybe it's just the fact that we went to the market Square location, but I won't go out of my way for this place again. Also, the so-called \"fresh\" Italian bread isn't so fresh. The end"}
{"text":"Its one of my favorite places to eat I highly recommend it there's nothing like the pistrami with egg but that's my favorite everyone is different the service is always good the food is always delicious you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"To me, it's a sandwich with fries and coleslaw on it, nothing special...

In venturing to Primanti Bros. I heard from locals around \"Go to Primanti Bros! It's a Pittsburgh staple.\" When arriving and seeing that all sandwiches came with fries and slaw on top, as well as a tomato, it sounded intriguing and delicious. I got their turkey and cheese, and it was good; the fries were probably the best part, however the coleslaw didn't seem like coleslaw to me. It was more like pickled cabbage, and the bread the sandwich was served on, unfortunately fell apart.

Our service was actually quite bad; Saturday lunch hour can be busy, however I felt rushed every time our waitress came over to us.

Be prepared to wait in line as well when coming, we didn't wait long but there was a line."}
{"text":"There is no place that defines the pride and heritage of  Pittsburgh sports while giving us a slice of the best pizza in the steel city and the greatest sandwiches ever created with the slaw and fries integrated."}
{"text":"No pretense at all and when I think of where to go when in PGH for a relaxed meal and a drink or \"two\", this is always good.

I've had the wings the last couple times I've been and they are quite good-very crispy and meaty and dripping in sauce-hot Buffalo (medium plus, I'd say) and parmesan garlic were both good.

Eating one of their signature sandwiches is enhanced the later in the evening it is, or if you're fighting back the morning after a rough one.  Still, pretty good, but the beef patty (\"#2 best seller\") won't be my choice next time (BLT, fish or pastrami are better).

This particular location is comparable to the original or the one in Monroeville, so I wouldn't miss one to go to the other."}
{"text":"Simply awful.. Long line and wait and terrible food. If I wanted a French fry and coleslaw burger I would of ordered one. Will never go back and I will discourage anyone from making the same mistake as me. 70 years you'd think they would know how to make a sandwich. All me and my party of 10 could do was laugh at the people taking pictures there. Easily worst meal I've had in years and all 10 of us agreed. Avoid at all cost unless you think want the worst and most unhealthy meal you'll have in years."}
{"text":"Everyone told me that once I moved to Pittsburgh I HAD to try these sandwiches.  

And all I can say is that they were rated best sandwich by travel channel for a reason!

They were life changing good.  The bread with corned beef and melted cheese, topped with the coolness of the vinegar and oil cole slaw and the warm crunch of the french fries, was mind blowing! It hit every sense in a light and flavorful way.  

Since moving here I'm happy to say I haven't had them again, I'm also so happy that they are far away from my new apartment or I would be the size of a house!"}
{"text":"I loved my Pgh-style sandwich with cole slaw and fries in it. Wish I could have my sandwich like that everyday! The quality of the bread, and everything in general, was excellent. I would give this place 5 stars instead of 4, but the server was a little out-of-it and didn't get our order right in a couple ways."}
{"text":"Wait staff sucks. They have one waiter/bartender per side (AKA 1 waiter per 11 tables plus the bar). They don't write down orders, so I guess they just assume they can remember all this shit. But OBVIOUSLY not because every time that I come here I ask for a dill pickle (which is a menu item) and out of the 5 times that I have asked, I have never received a dill pickle. Annoying"}
{"text":"My wife and I ran the Pittsburgh marathon at the beginning of the month, and could not think of a better way to replenish afterwards than at Primanti Bros! I had the pistrami with everything, and she had the salami with everything but onions. Of course eggs topped both samiches.

Both samiches were perfectly delicious, and hit the spot so well as we washed them down with a cold beer. This place is always a must stop when we are in town!"}
{"text":"One of the most tasty sandwiches I had in the US. Extremely huge, extremely much stuffed with fries! I'd say the size is enough for 2-3 girls, with free refill soda. Yum!"}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time last night and it was really good. Better than the cranberry location we thought. Delicious sandwiches and wings. Fast and friendly service. And our two year old was not cooperating with dinner, but our server couldn't have been more understanding about it. Our new primanti's spot"}
{"text":"Well, I must say that if you are from the local area, then you probably like this place (these places - there are now several).  I've tried the multi-stack sandwiches and simply cannot get into it at all.  There are just so many other places that truly appeal over this local chain that I am struggling to shell out two starts, let alone cash for some of these meals. Hey, if you like the place, that's great! Enjoy it.  I will not join in, so count me out."}
{"text":"These places are what you would say \"acquired tastes.\" Listen, I get it. I honestly get it. It's a burgh thing. Right. Ok, woohoo, high five n'at. But I'm not giving this more than a single star. I like bread. This is not what I call bread. It's weak. The slop of fries...  Ok. Stop right there. I'm having an issue with these fries. They are dark. They are grease soaked. They might even have iron filings in them (could be a steel city thing, not sure) but my expectation of fries derives from the old country. Like bread. Did I mention bread before? Can someone please explain to me why the bread is flimsy and the fries are brown and greasy and not white and crispy?!? These are basic things, but it's entirely possible that if this is the stuff you grew up with and have no other frame of reference then it's completely understandable that you 1) like this food and 2) expect someone to give it a positive review.  For me this IS a positive review. I'm positive that the bread is weak, lacks any sort of crunch and density and the fries are like oil-soaked, limp, polystyrene. To eat here again it would have to be a serious emergency, under the influence of copious amounts of beer, liquor, what have you, and nothing else would have to be open for business. Out of town guests that are taken in to these places are simply being nice by saying \"mmm, nice!\" So, no. No to the bland. No to the tasteless. No to the recycled oil-soaked thingy's. Just no."}
{"text":"Good food .  Tons of TV's!  Great place to watch a Game!  BUT,  it's a Very Loud atmosphere.  You have to talk Very Loud to the person next to you so they can hear U."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I guess it's a historic place but  in my opinion the sandwich was really pretty poor.  My husband did have a great local beer recommended by our server. It was the highlight of the meal.  I ordered a glass of Chardonnay that was served warm.   Yuck!  I would recommend trying s different sandwich. On a positive note I thought the slaw on the sandwich was pretty good!"}
{"text":"I'm from Delaware so when I think of a great sandwich I think of a Philly cheese steak or a sub from Capriotis. 

I love this place. I got the capicola and cheese... With tomato, french (freedom?) fries, and coleslaw of course. Fresh bread, meat and cheese, what's not to like? Next time I'll get mine with a fried egg. 

I also had their own Iron City beer which they gave me a to-go cup for which I thought was awesome. 

Easily one of the best sandwiches I've had in ages. I cannot recommend them enough!"}
{"text":"I like this place very much and I really like th people who work here.  Very friendly and fast service.  I love their sandwiches because they are HUGE!!!  Bring your family!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We both had the Reuben
Sandwich but we could only eat half so we finished it off for dinner the same evening. Staff was nice & one of the waitresses took our picture for us. We sat at the counter, fun atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Primanti Bros but it wasn't my first sandwich like this. We have a place in Ohio called Paninis and it also has a sandwich with fries and coleslaw on it. I can say with great certainty that this sandwich was so much better than Paninis. 

There are so many different sandwiches to choose from! I had the hot sausage with cheese and an egg....yum. It was in no way greasy like other big sandwiches. The coleslaw was so flavorful and falling out of the bread there was so much. Definitely filled me up. 

Also it was really awesome to see a place in Pittsburgh that sold Great Lakes Christmas Ale. Seeing something familiar from your home state, especially beer, is a nice surprise. Hearing someone from Pittsburgh order it? Even cooler!"}
{"text":"All we heard about before taking the trip to Pittsburgh was how we HAD to try Promantie Brothers while we there, it was the classic, historic place to eat while visiting. So of course we tried it, and of course like I imagine, most people probably have it after a long night out, which we did. I have to say the best part is that they stay open late for the bar crowd to have an option of food after the long night. But that may just be the best part as all I could really taste on my sandwich was the fries. I know that is what they are known for and had heard the staff doesn't appreciate \"specialty\" orders that late, besides of course having to try the original on the first attempt, but I can't say it was for my taste having that many fries on there. If that's your thing I would certainly say this is your place or definitely say you have to try it on your first trip to Pittsburgh since it is the classic but would warn you to prepare for it. I would maybe give it another try if I were in Pitt just to see if it was that particular night/sandwich/location as it is a landmark itself but first impression was too many fries and wouldn't go out of my way for it. The place was small and the atmosphere was laid back, kind of a drinking crowd and pretty loud. We didn't eat there but it wouldn't be out of the question."}
{"text":"As a native Pittsburgh, I would say \"of course I'm a fan\" but can't because I know many Pittsburgh's that are not.  I love it though.  I rarely go home without getting my go-to Capicola and Cheese.  I have mixed feelings on their big expansion.  Happy for their success but sad because it seems to take away from the originality and charm of what I experienced growing up.  Will continue to go, one of my favs."}
{"text":"I love Primantis. I have never had a bad meal here and I highly recommend the \"Drunk Duck\", a delicious cocktail. Whether having a salad or a sandwich, a good place for good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Primanti is a highlight of pittsburgh and a must-visit when going! You walk in and the first thing that hits you is how loud it is! Come in when a game is playing and you can hear the cheers and whoops everytime pittsburgh scores. I personally love the Philly cheesesteaks- they are amazing! I love the fact that they put their fries in the sandwich! The prices are decent and the sizes are huge! Definitely eat here! The reason they lost a star is only because the service is pretty slow. It can take a while to get a seat (I usually like to take it out, though) and a while for them to make your sandwich- other than that- I would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I have always stayed at La Quinta while in Pittsburgh, and it's so nice to have Primanti Brothers within a short walking distance (and no highway to cross)!  Food is fantastic, great prices on both food and happy hour drinks, and you can get beer to go if you want to relax in your hotel room.  If only they had a smoking section but I understand the local laws.  Great ambiance, wonderful staff!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The  customer service was average. I went to try the pastrami. It was good. Kind of interesting with everything cramped into one sandwich. This would be a once in a blue moon type of place."}
{"text":"There are a few things you need to do if you visit Pittsburgh: see a Penguins game (or at least visit) the Consol Energy Center, view the downtown skyscrapers from one of the many picturesque view points across one of the bridges, and complain about the Primanti Brothers sandwich with a few Steelers fans.

In theory, it sounds like it would be fun to fit as much as you can between two loaves of bread; however, it is not as appeasing in practice. The best game-plan that I can offer is to try to bite the sandwich as is for the first bite in order to appreciate the experience, and then to \"accidentally\" allow the french fries to fallout during the second bite so that you can appreciate the food.

This location is also a memento for many Pitt students as a few late night journeys involve a stop here."}
{"text":"worst experience ever at this location. Waited over an hour to get burnt pizza and a cold sandwich. Waitress never came over to tell us they had burnt our first pizza but the second one was burnt also. She didn't want us to ask what was taking so long so she never came over so our glasses were empty. Very disappointed   They did take the pizza off but not the cold sandwich. The second pizza we got 3/4 of it was not burnt so we didn't mind that. Primanti use to be one of my favorite quick stop places to eat."}
{"text":"Holy cow this was the best sandwich i have ever eaten . It was so good my fiancé and I had to share another! Ughh I wish I lived in Pittsburgh just so I could go every day. 

That's all I gotta say. BEST DAMN SANDWICH EVER"}
{"text":"All the buzz about this place is true. Top 3 sandwiches I've ever head. Nothing can compare to Primanti on a Saturday before game day for lunch."}
{"text":"It's a deli that puts coleslaw and fries in a sandwich.  The sandwich was OK...nothing fantastic but not horrible either.  However, I fail to see why this place was featured on a number of food shows as one of the best sandwich places in America.  

Basically, as with many of the places on TV shows, the hype and reputation are actually better than the actual food."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner after a youth hockey game. We were all in good spirits since our team won. Being in good spirits always goes a long way in having a great time at a sports bar.  And a great time we had!  Two of us had the personal pizza. Their crust is the best. It is simultaneously crunchy and chewy.  The beer went well with it too. Another in our party had a classic primanti's sandwich which he devoured. This is a newer building so the layout is nice with enough room, natural light, and many HD tv's. The noise level was slightly elevated which heightened the sense of good time.  The only downside to this location is getting out onto Rt 19.  Sometimes turning left toward Bethel Park is not possible due to traffic."}
{"text":"Came to Primanti's after an amateur ice hockey game at Alpha Ice Complex.  The mood was great since we had a win, but the food unfortunately was a bit of disappointment.  I got the personal pizza, which while usually awesome, was under cooked and doughy.  I had no silverware, and when I asked for some the waitress replied \"I'll see if I can find some.\"  Ha ha whatever."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are often raved about, and they're good, but I come here for the pizza - specifically the personal pizza.  It includes 3 toppings which makes it easy to order instead of fretting over how much extra an additional topping is.  The crust I think is what makes these pizzas standout.  It also pairs great with a beer and they have good craft beers on tap. At my most recent visit, there was 3 of us and we all wanted the pizza so we decided to get a 14\" deluxe which includes 5 toppings. It was large enough because we weren't starving, but on a more usual night we would need to order a larger pizza.  The crust in the center of the pizza was soggy.  This doesn't seem to be an issue with the smaller personal size pizzas. This is a good place if you're looking for a fun time with conversation that prompts laughter, to watch sports in the background, maybe to tell a few exaggerated stories."}
{"text":"Get this: It's darn near 1 AM in the mornin' and we're dahn in the Strip for some jagoff concert at the Altar Bar (you know, next to the McDonald's, across the street from where that Chinese place used t'be). My cousin, who been drinkin' whiskey and pop all night, he look over at me and ask, \"Djeat yet?\" Other than the dozen or so Arn Cities I been poundin' back (and that's not even countin' the pahr hahr before we left), I was thinkin' we'd polish off a mangled box of Mrs. T's (that I fit back together to put in the freezer with some gumbands) that I have back at my hahs. I hit 'im with the \"Nah, djew?\" and next thing you know we're aht at the Priman'i's gettin' some food 'n' at. I'm big on the double egg and cheese, but some people like that capp and egg and some people are more abaht other meats. Honestly, yinz can get whatever you want, it ain't gonna bother me much."}
{"text":"We did the obligatory Primanti Bros stop on our recent first visit to Pittsburgh. We can understand how it's a novelty to have fries on everything. But if they're not seasoned well and crisp...what's the point? When a place gets talked up so much, you can't help but have big expectations. We were disappointed...

Here's the thing, when you sit down at a restaurant and the table is filthy, the menus have food all over them, and they bring your drinks in Solo cups...Without a doubt, if I were still in college and needed to nurse a hangover, this would probably be a go-to place. 

My husband ordered the Italian Sausage, which was obscenely big, with good flavor, but again the fries were mush and flavorless. Luckily, we had ordered an additional side of slaw, because that's truly what made the sandwich, which was very tasty. We also ordered the \"vegetarian\" soup which was good, but I ordered a chix salad because a MASSIVE sandwich with fries and slaw on it was just not calling me. Little did I know, the gimmick of fries on everything meant fries on everything....including my salad. It was really gross to have these tasteless grease piles on my salad which I couldn't even eat. Although we were dining there, the salad came in a plastic to-go box and pre-packaged dressing in a packet. The chicken was like tasteless rubber. 

We checked of the \"Primanti Bros\" box, but won't be back."}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh for a convention, and everyone I talked to said you have to go to Primanti Bros, so we did. Went there for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon and luckily it wasn't super crowded. The staff was semi-nice, not overly friendly and didn't seem to be too happy to be there. We ordered our sandwiches - I got the Rajun Cajun because I had a Philly Cheesesteak the day before and was trying to cut back on red meat. I kind of regretted it as the chicken was a bit dry. My coworkers had ordered  the pastrami and steak and made me wish I had. Not that the sandwich wasn't good - but red juicy meat would have been so much better.  The sandwich was massive - I got a huge piece of chicken breast with a crapload of coleslaw and fries on top.  My coworker did complain that he got very little pastrami meat on his.  Overall, a pretty good place - not sure if it lived up to the hype.  I hope to eventually go back and order the pastrami or steak."}
{"text":"Where to start!? On entering The lot I noticed the small building and was shocked. There's a small parking lot that was somewhat full. On entering I was greeted by victor he would be my server for my meal. I requested a booth bring it was only me and that's where I prefer to sit. He was totally chill about it and was happy to seat me. He asked if I been here before and wanted to see if I had any questions. (Thinking who hasn't had Primantis lol) He made it clear it was wing night and now I could pick between bone in and bone less now on Mondays. I took a few minutes to look over the menu and decided on a favorite of mine being the \"capicola and cheese add pickles\" and grabbed 5 honey mustard wings. The food came out in about10 minutes so I was pleased even tho I was in no rush. A thing I notice is the sandwich is really hot or just kinda warm when I come but today was really hot. The fries where nice and crispy not soggy. It was great it really hit the spot big time! As for the wings I got 4 drums and a 1 flat so I'm not complaining. The wings where very crispy yet super juicy and meaty and had a good amount of sauce. I was really craving a coke with fresh limes and when victor came back to get me a refill he even made sure to put more fresh limes in it. He was really attentive and made sure I was set the whole time. Also being wing night it was nice to have a roll of paper towels on the table for whenever you need a few. This trip may have been my best experience I've ever had at a Primantis. Overall I will definitely be returning to this location in the very near future."}
{"text":"Primantis in the waterfront? Count me in! This place looks awesome from the outside. I was surprised that after my recent visit to the waterfront I noticed this and knew I had to come back to try it. On pulling up parking was a breeze but it can definitely be tricky. After walking in to the establishment it was packed on a Sunday night after 7pm. I was shocked and worried about how things would go with staff because of the people waiting and standing around We decided to stay and wait it out. After being seated after about 10 minuets we then where ignored in the back section as staff continued to walk past us as no one knew who's table we where. After waiting around 15 minuets or so the waiter comes over and says \"did I help you yet\" we said no and he apologized and said sorry about that I'm having a bad night they fired two people and called me in on my day off and I was at the bar? I understand not every night is good with any job but key rule is make the guest happy. He kept saying sorry all night and saying how he shouldn't be working today and it just got upsetting. I do wanna say I liked the new menu they put out at this place. We decided to order 3 orders of wings and a steak sandwich to share also I'm not sure why some locations say they don't off pickles just a spare when I've had it before on a sandwich. Another waitress brought out the food and told her she forgot a order of wings and we asked for the coleslaw on the side. She did not seem happy and sent the sandwich back and said the other order of wings would still be another few minutes. We did not get a order of celery that they normally give. We asked for ketchup being the one at the table was empty and the new one was dirty and practically empty. We where really disappointed with the service even after this location is somewhat newer. Anymore I'm just upset with Primantis and I'm not sure if I'll return to this location."}
{"text":"As a  turkish guy, I found the sandwiches amazing! Good cuts of meat, hot dries, and Cole slaw! Brilliant! Btw Travis, you are the best."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches.  Could use a little more meat to offset all the French fries but still good.  Worth the wait if you have never had it before."}
{"text":"What's not to love about the original? IC light and the best sandwiches with the best bread? The other primantis are good but I prefer the original!"}
{"text":"We were expecting so much more. We of course wanted to see what the hype was all about. We ordered the \"Pitt burger\" and boy was it disappointing.  The burger is dry and lacks flavor. The fries were old and greasy. The Cole slaw was ok, it did help the taste buds experience a little flavor. The bread was the worst part. Big, dry, and old. Ugh. 
They were out of fried pickles so we didn't get a chance to try those. 

Trust the reviews, it's not worth the wait or the money!"}
{"text":"Stopped by two times this weekend as I was in the area again). Get an egg thrown in the mix on your sandwich. Tried the pittsburgher cheesesteak, I was expecting a regular burger patty or sliced steak, ended up being a weird patty almost like a meatloaf (not a burger). Not sure I'd order that again. Pastrami and cheese was still good. Wish the egg came a little runny."}
{"text":"While I was at my Hotel, I heard people talking about this place. I opted to check it out for myself, since it was walkable distance from my hotel.

Walking in, I took at seat and there was a young man RIGHT THERE offering me a menu. He surprised me.  He Shared with me his idea of what was best and I ordered a diet coke, a roast beef sandwich with the slaw on the side.  

I think what surprised me the most was that the sandwich didn't come on a plate, just wrapped in paper.  The slaw, since it was on the side,was a HUGE serving, and in one of the boats you'd get your fries in.  I was told it's best with a bit of hot sauce, since the hot sauce was only cyanne pepper, I tried it.  It was Ok. The slaw was a vinegar based so it was pretty tasty.  The sandwich was rather large.. I could only eat half of it.  The combo of Italian Bread, cheese, meat, fries, tomato and more cheese was absolutely delish. I'd have eaten more if I could. 

Damned fine solid sammy."}
{"text":"On our way home from Canada, we decided to cut thru Pittsburgh!! The hubby wanted to try this place because Adam Richman from Man vs Food ate here. It was a Sunday, football Sunday, ugh.. so the street was packed like anything. Parking was a nightmare, we had to wait in line to get a table, but we ended up taking the sandwiches to go and headed out to a parking lot and chow down there.

Sandwiches were pretty decent, prices were reasonable, but this place is too over hyped. I had the pastrami and that was delicious, I thought the cole slaw had a sour punch to it, bread tasted fresh, fries were kinda cold.  The hubby got angus steak and that was delicious too. 

Definitely will come back if i'm in town."}
{"text":"The satellite Primanti's locations leave a lot to be desired, and Hampton may be the worst I've been to thus far.  The suburban locations lose the charm and edge that made Primanti's a Pittsburgh icon, and make just as drastic sacrifices in food.  The expanded menu would best be avoided.  They make one thing well, and that's the standard Primanti's sandwich.  If you're interested in anything else, you're better off eating elsewhere.

Service was slow at the Hampton location, and it felt like they tried to cram too many tables into the space.  The tables were uncomfortably close, and we couldn't so much as adjust our chairs without bumping people at another table.  The sandwiches were alright, but below the quality I'm used to.  It was an alright meal, but I won't go back.  If you want Primanti's, it's worth making the 20 minute drive to one of the original locations."}
{"text":"Ate here today, now sick in the stomach !!  Had the jumbo. Very bad choice. They should take it off the menu!  BUYER BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"A solid 4-stars for a solid-as-hell sandwich! 

I mean, why mess with silverware?...just pile all those side dishes (slaw and fries) between those buns and get to work. You should be full for approximately 29 hours. 

On a recent beautiful day in Pittsburgh, my pal Rachel C and I popped over to Primanti Bros. Of course, an institution...visitors must at least try it once. Like Deep Dish pizza in Chicago or bagels in New York. You just gotta, ok? Locals seem to be split on whether its worth it...so, saddle on up to give it a shot yourself. 

Sitting outside on Market Square in the sunshine (and with Batman filming in the near distance!), we embarked on my first Primanti experience. Bros is right...these are definitely NOT dainty sandwiches, by any means! DO not come here on a first date, there is literally no way to eat this beast politely. 

My turkey and cheese was a \"lighter\" option, if that exists...but I will still full for the requisite 29 hours or so. Did it blow my mind? No. Did I find it fun and interesting and did it taste good? YES! Wash it down with a Diet Coke and we were set to jet to take Pittsburgh by storm the rest of the day. 

Or, needed a nap. 

Wear the stretchy pants.

{"text":"While in Pittsburgh we gave this popular place a try. The seating process was a little confusing. There was a hostess stand by the front door but it wasn't staffed. After waiting a while thinking the hostess was seating another party, we stopped waiting and found seats at the bar. It took a little longer than expected to be waited on but once we were the food and drinks came fast.

The sandwich was enjoyable but wasn't anything that I'm missing now that I'm home. If you're in town it's worth giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I ve been to Pittsburgh many times, this was my first visit and it was great !! Had the Pittsburger, and it was all it was hyped up to be !! Delicious and a must do in the burg !! Friendly staff, a truly iconic place , in my favorite part of Pittsburgh, strip district and Primanti brothers are amazing !!"}
{"text":"I'm a recent transplant to Pittsburgh and Primanti's has quickly become one of my family's go to spots for dinner. It's close, doesn't cost much and the food and service is great. What's not to like?  They also have Dr Pepper which, oddly enough, is not that easy to find in Pittsburgh area restaurants for some reason."}
{"text":"Primantis has changed a lot over the years. They now have more options than ever, you don't order at the kitchen counter anymore. (Someone will come take your order). This location is the most authentic to the original Primantis. It's kindof divey & not overly corporate like the ones outside of the city. Quick service, same taste as always. This is a casual setting where you can grab a quick bite, or bring your friends to hang out for a couple beers, and load up on carbs."}
{"text":"Love it!  The food is always fresh tasting.  There is a decent beer selection and the service is great! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I went for lunch.  It was very quick and the rajun Cajun was great!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite primantis location. Fantastic happy hour- half price drinks, even beer. The sandwiches of course, are amazing and a must-try of in the area. Turkey and corn beef are my favorites. Don't get the $1 slices of pizza during happy hour- not even worth a dollar."}
{"text":"If there is a better late night feast than Primanti Brothers' cheeseburger and fries, I do not know where to find it.  For the low price of $7.99, one receives a delicious half pound burger with choice of cheese and toppings, plus a generous order of Primanti's great french fries.  Couple this with the 9:00 p. m. to 11:00 p. m. happy hour where one can receive a glass of fine house wine for a mere $2.38, and the case is made to come to Primanti Brothers virtually every time my wife and I dine out after a Pittsburgh Pirates game (as well as coming here at other times). The restaurant excels with service as well.  Server Michelle, who took care of us on Saturday, September 13, 2014, is top-notch in every respect as is our good friend, Matt R.  The servers are somehow able to hear the diner above the frenzy that one can count on at the bar on Saturday nights. It is rare that one does not receive attentive, friendly service here. Residents of the area are fortunate to have an exceptional restaurant like Primanti Brothers in their backyard!"}
{"text":"I really, really, really want to like this place because everyone has been raving about it.

I'll have to come back and give it another try, the service here was pretty slow and the food came out kind of cold. Not my best experience"}
{"text":"I feel like Primanti's is the Pittsburgh equivalent of the Billy Goat in Chicago. Crappy food and crappy service, but people tell you to go there for a slice of nostalgia you don't care about not being from the city or ever planning to return. 

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The Garlic Parmesan wings are delicious! Good price for satisfying (and rather larger portions of) food! It's a must-eat in Pittsburgh. Only thing is that some of the workers pronounce \"gyros\" wrong... Really made me cringe."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple that you have to try at least once while you're there.  The sandwiches are massive and piled with coleslaw and fries-I had pastrami with egg and bacon and it was delish.  The cheese, bacon, chili, etc fries were lackluster-the bacon is really just bacos.  Not exactly the best sandwich I've ever had, but an experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"I'm not a native pittsburgher, maybe that's the problem, but I found the sandwiches with the coleslaw and french fries really disgusting. I've tried it several times, at different locations, and pretty much the same at all locations.... I guess I just don't get it"}
{"text":"I know it's a Pittsburgh thing, and I've really tried to like it. Three or four times. But I really find it pretty disgusting. There's no subtlety or taste, just a bunch of stuff piled On bread."}
{"text":"Sometimes things are famous simply because they're famous, or tenacious and then people think they're good because they just stick around.  Well, not so with Primanti Brothers.  Their soups and chili are surprisingly good, and I do like the messy slaw/fry/sandwich on waxed paper deal.  They run a tight ship - no plates, no credit cards, but good food and an extensive selection.  They are even accommodating for little kids and will do a grilled cheese sans slaw.  I've never had bad service or a bad experience and will gladly go when the lines aren't too bad.  It's a good, solid pub food experience.  Expect that, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My expectations started off pretty high; after all, this is a Pittsburgh landmark that almost everybody has ever heard about. I love french fries on pretty much everything, however, I was rather let down. The cole slaw was delicious on the sandwich, but the french fries were disappointing. The fries were soggy, flavorless, and they were a waste of space on my sandwich. This place does not deserve all of the hype that it gets."}
{"text":"Gone downhill so fast!  

What happened?? 

Sandwiches completely suck.  No meat!! They've completely skimped.

Now, their pizza, which was once excellent and one of the best in the city, completely stinks!!! It's awful!!  They use much cheaper, salty, tasteless ingredients.  Their sauce, which was awesome, is non existent.  Crust is sooo thin!! 

Whole family once loved the place.  Now it's someplace we avoid."}
{"text":"Arrived from CA, was told I needed to stop by before I leave. One of the best advice given.  Crew was great and sandwiches are awesome. My advice to anyone who comes in,  the menu is above the grill and on the wall. You can tell who's not from around when asking for a menu.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Simply awesome. Cold slaw and hot fries in the heart of the sandwich. Add a beer and achieve complete satisfaction. Don't miss this truly Pittsburg experience."}
{"text":"Primantis is BAE  I will never ever let it go. I will follow it to the depths of the sea even after our ship goes down. Thank you for never giving up on me like Jack never gave up on Rose. This is my favorite place to eat more than any of the other thousands of places I have eaten in my life."}
{"text":"Me and my girl visited this place last weekend for our small out of towner to Pittsburgh and was told by the locals to come here for a good sandwich. Holy cow was our meal awesome! First off this is a tiny little spot that seats about 20/30 people. We both ordered a drunk duck which was like a amf drink and came with a really cool little rubber duck in it. Next came our entrees and she got the pittsburger which came with fries and cole slaw on it and I got a kielbasa with cheese which also came with fries and cole slaw, and we also shared some freakin delicious chili cheese fries. All in all it was an amazing experience and the only reason I gave it four stars was because the waiting staff passed us around a couple of times and it got a little confusing. Definitely recommend coming back!"}
{"text":"I feel like a traitor to Pittsburgh, but I really don't like this place.  Some of their meats, when they should be slow cooked and cut thick, are paper thin and are more like something the deli at Shop n Save would serve.  The bread for their sandwiches just isn't good bread...try some thick cut rye or whole grain maybe????  The sandwiches are filling, but when I have to slather on mayo, ketchup, mustard and whatever else to make a sandwich flavorful...why did I just order it? Beer is good and cheap there.  Ambiance is ok.  But if I want a really, really good sandwich, I'll go elsewhere.  

I love the history, and I love what the sandwiches stand for...just not going to visit there for a meal if something else is available."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. However, it is a local's joint and since there really isn't much that Pittsburgh is known for food wise, it's worth trying. 

When deciding what to order, try one of their famous fries and slaw stuffed sandwiches on two slices of French bread. You can't go wrong with the pastrami and cheese sandwich. It almost reminds me of a Reuben sandwich, but without the sauerkraut. I'd probably ask them to double the meat or put the fries on the side next time. I felt like the fries overpowered the pastrami and slaw. 

The service here is friendly and they've got a limited selection of beer comprising mostly of watered down american beer. Ambiance is like that of a Lucille's or any chain that serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Had a Pitts-burger, ground meat, cole slaw, fries, and cheese all built into a sandwich. Very crowded the day after Christmas. Burger was very good, atmosphere was lively, lots of fun. Service as good but the servers were very busy, we didn't see ours very often. Our pace was slow so it didn't matter."}
{"text":"how can you not be a fan of a huge pile of whatever you ordered with fresh cut fries, tangy coleslaw, cheese, and tomato smooshed between 2 thick slices of fresh italian bread?  if you aren't, there is something seriously wrong with you.  oh, and don't forget to pair it with a yuengling and a whole bunch of the cayenne pepper sauce.  also - make sure to say 'hi' to lefty!  he'll appreciate that."}
{"text":"Absolute worst experience ever. Started out with the waitress (later learned was Mylee) , asking us our order without writing it down. After giving my order she grabbed the menu from my hands and said \"I'm sorry I need to look at the menu and can you tell me it again?\" I almost wanted to invest in a notepad for her. Our food was then brought out missing two items I ordered, by ANOTHER server because Mylee was too busy sitting in a booth eating her dinner and txting. Never once were we asked how our food was, to which I would have explained I never even got half the stuff I ordered. The food was terrible enough that my mother literally didn't even want to take it home. Worst primantis experience ever and would never come back to this store again."}
{"text":"This is a Pittsburgh institution. Offers great food for a great value. It's in the heart of downtown in Market Square. 
 
So what do you order here? A sandwich, of course. Every sandwich here is topped with french fries and coleslaw. Can't go wrong with french fries in a sandwich! We ordered the corned beef, cheese and egg sandwich. It was absolutely amazing. It is big enough to share! The egg is perfectly cook so when you take a bite into the sandwich the yolk is oozing out of the sandwich. Definitely a must try in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"To be quite honest... I was expecting a lot better from a place that has such a fine reputation within the city.  I ordered the #2 best seller, the Cheesesteak and I really wasn't impressed. 

Believe me I wanted it to be quite yummy and it really did look amazing, except the taste was just not there.  The slaw dominated the sandwich and the patty itself had no flavor whatsoever.

The people there were friendly and the chili cheese fries did really save the experience and kept me from giving this place 1 star.  I would love to try some of the other sandwiches sometime, but sadly for my first time, I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong - Primanti's is a Pittsburgh staple, and nothing beats going here at 1 AM after a night at the bars and grabbing a sandwich and suds, but this place is what Pittsburgh is known for and the city is moving in a different direction. I will always cherish this place and I recommend trying it at least once so you can say you did it, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. If you are going I recommend a cap with cheese or a fish colossal fish sandwich. I do still find myself wandering over on Friday's during lent."}
{"text":"If I were on death row and asked what I wanted for my last meal, it would definitely be a Primanti Bros sandwich. I've been going to Primanti Bros for years and whenever I come back to Da Burgh, I always stop here.

You don't go here for the decor or atmosphere. You go for the most unique sandwich this side of the Mississippi. When deciding on a sandwich go for the Kolbassi -- you won't be disappointed. Yes, its greasy. Yes, its a gut bomb. and Yes, it will be the best sandwich you've had in LONG time.  

No person can truly say they've been to Pittsburgh until they've been to Primanti Bros and washed it all down with an Iron City."}
{"text":"This place is great for cheap beer. I have to be in a special mood for their food since it's focused on their sandwiches. Their famous sandwiches are good, but that's about it."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the world. All of these negative reviews are trash and should not be acknowledged."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Primantis before they sold out and franchised. Evidence of corporate takeover is everywhere at this location. 
When we got there I went to wash my hands. I was accompanied by a friendly but annoying fruit fly. The paper towel dispenser was empty so I dried my hands on my pants. 
Someone other than our server brought our sandwiches to our table. He tried to figure out which was which for a minute until we told him to just set them down and we'd figure it out. We also saw him stroll the length of the dining room with tray of food looking for its expectant diners. 
The fries on our sandwiches ranged in color from dark brown to black and in texture from crunchy to rock hard. And they were cold. We sent them back and they were replaced by acceptable ones. 
It's really sad that the Primanti Brothers once proud name is attached to a place that stinks of corporate greed and apathy."}
{"text":"The fabled Primanti's sandwich has been a favorite of yinzers from time immemorial. Now that I live in Vegas, Primanti's is a required stop every time I come home."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros. is ok.  Their signature sandwiches with fries in the sandwich are not anything I would order again.  Their pizza is awesome however.  Not my favorite place, but it's ok."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what I write in this review. If you've never tried it before and you find yourself in Pittsburgh, you're going to try Primanti Brothers. I tried it despite reading all the reviews telling me how mediocre it is. I needed to try it for myself. And I'm glad I did. Now I know I need to never come back here again. 

This place is just one big NO. I have no idea how it has become so popular. I really do not get it. I got the pastrami and cheese. This was the sandwich: a slice of regular white bread, three slices of tomatoes, two tablespoons of bland cole slaw, 2 pounds of french fries, one tiny little slice of cheese, about 3-4 slices of pastrami, and another slice of regular white bread. As you can tell from my description, there was not enough meat, non-existent cheese, and way too many fries. The only thing on my sandwich with any flavor was the pastrami (that was actually pretty good and what earned this place a 2-star rating instead of a 1-star). But there just wasn't enough pastrami and the signature fries and cole slaw were not very good. 

My sister ordered the cheesesteak, which is really just a cheeseburger. We also ordered the Smallman St. Fries, which are fries with cheese, bacon, chili, and sour cream. They sound delicious right? They looked delicious too. I was super excited to eat them. Sadly, like my sandwich, they did not live up to the hype. I think it was the chili, but I did not enjoy them. 

This place was crazy crowded and it's clearly a Pittsburgh staple so maybe it's just me. It's sad really because the sandwiched have so much potential to be amazing!"}
{"text":"After a night at the bars in this area, some fries and burgers will always be fucking bomb. So this place is supposedly a \"must go\" in Pittsburgh. So here I am. 

The burger meat is ok. Not the highest quality, the bread was not toasted which was different but very good. Their thing here is to put fries and cole slaw in their burgers. It adds an additional layer of flavor and texture to the food. 

I wish the ingredients were higher quality but for $6.89 what can you really expect? 

The bartender is really super friendly and nice. Cool chill spot."}
{"text":"This is a Pittsburgh favorite. I have eaten at Primanti Brothers on several visits. They are good  but not the holy experience that locals would have you believe. It's worth eating there because for my friends that live in Pittsburgh this is their restaurant of choice. Maybe it's the slaw on the sandwich or the fries. I don't know. Maybe I don't get it or something. I really want to love this place but will just have to say yeah I like Primanti Bros. but I also like Subway."}
{"text":"This place was a really fun stop while I was in Pittsburgh.  I had the corned beef and cheese sandwich with an Iron City beer.  It was truly an unique experience.  I can't say I have ever had a sandwich like that.  The service was really great.  The giller was very friendly and made an excellent recommendation for the sandwich and the other staff asked several times if I needed anything else.  One warning: they only take cash.  There is an ATM in the entrance way if you need to take some out.  The next time I'm visiting Pittsburgh or driving through I'll be sure to hit up a Primanti Brothers location."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours so DON'T believe it if YELP says its closing in 3 minutes!!!  Food was outstanding - try the Kielbasa with cheese - that's what I had - chase it down with a few golden bevs and walk out satisfied and with a great, classic Pittsburgh experience. Joghly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you pass through Pittsburgh this place is a must visit. Their specialty sandwich is like no other. They're a little short on conversation but I guess that's part of the packaged deal. If I ever moved to Pittsburgh I'd move near one of their locations ; )"}
{"text":"Love hitting up food joints that are authentically Piitsburgh! Kind of hard to eat a sandwich with fries and slaw in the middle on soft slices of bread, but once you understand the history and tradition of the sandwich it magically tastes better!

Not exactly family friendly but they do have high chairs and can accommodate a large party"}
{"text":"According to their website these sandwiches were designed for hungry truckers who had to make quick late night deliveries so they could eat with one hand and drive with the other hand.
I'm not sure I really buy that story because even with two hands, it's nearly impossible to eat one successfully without everything falling out.

It's definitely something very authentic to Pittsburgh, and even if you don't enjoy the food, is worth dropping by just to say you've had one."}
{"text":"Love hitting this place up every time we come to Pittsburgh. Bathroom stinks like piss. Wish they would keep it clean and fresh. Sandwiches are great... not out of this world delicious, but always hits the spot. Very satisfying and filling."}
{"text":"Decided to try the place since I heard about it and is listed in things to do in Pittsburgh. This place is really connected to Pittsburgh itself and Conan even mentioned it in one of his shows as a place to eat at.

Ordered the \"2nd most popular\" item which was the cheesesteak that was very, very plain. Nothing great about the patty. The thing was HUGE and stacked with fries and coleslaw which I found didn't work well (although there are others out there that do it with success!)

You can't deviate and ask for it without the coleslaw either and their menu stated it as \"All of our sandwiches come with...\"

The portions are huge, one order can feed 2 average appetites.  

The fries were the only upside of this place.

The service here is horrible.. there was 2 people running the place and our tables werent clean and it takes forever.. I don't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place.

I don't think I will ever go back again."}
{"text":"We just did a quick dinner here last night. Sundays are $.48 wings so we ordered hot ranch and honey BBQ. Both were good, I preferred the hot ranch over the bbq but my husband liked it the other way around. The wings were crispy and perfectly sauced so that was a relief. 

They don't have a lot of specialty beers on draft, most of them are cheap domestics. They do however have craft beers in the bottle, maybe 10 -12 choices.

We really wanted a salad so we shared the caribbean chopped salad with mango vinaigrette. It said it came with apple wood smoked bacon, shredded cheddar cheese and corn which sounded great. But when the salad came to the table it looked like a premixed bag tossed with corn, bacon bits, no onions and the cheese were those tiny shreds. I was not impressed at all. for $8.49 I'm expecting more than bacon bits and cold freezer burned chicken. Yea the chicken on my salad was hard and warm like the through it in the microwave from frozen.

I only really like to play pool here or get a sandwich otherwise its not worth it to me."}
{"text":"Our last dinner in town and we wanted to try the place we saw on tv. Great service, we sat upstairs and watched the kitchen make food for us and others. I had the corned beef and cheese. They pile the sandwiches high with meat, cheese, French fries and Cole slaw. Come hungry or plan on bringing some home. The bread is key to their sandwiches, fresh and cut thick. If you come from out of town, like local institutions, and want a hearty meal, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Came here for the hype, but was pretty disappointed. The food was decent, but would probably not be back again. 

We ordered the buffalo and garlic wings. The wings were very small and overcooked. The buffalo sauce was extremely salty and the garlic was too oily. I've had better wings at buffalo wild wings. 

As for the sandwich, we got the #2. The sandwich was packed with so much stuff, it was hard to eat and it just became very messy. The only thing good about this place is the price. It was pretty cheap and everything came out to around $25."}
{"text":"Was promptly seated at the restaurant that was about 25% occupied. My server, Angela, dropped the menu and asked if I had eaten at the restaurant previously. I answered \"no\" and that's when the fun began. 

She raced through an introduction of the place advising all the sandwiches look like the one on the cover of the menu (some sort of special bread...not exactly sure what else she said as she ran through the script at  laser speed). And the special is the When Pigs Fly  \"that you can see on the card that's on top of the napkin holder.\" No other info just,  \"on the card.\" By the way, the menu Angela left was filthy with dried grease and food. When she returned to take my order she stood almost behind my chair. In order to have any eye contact I literally had to turn more than 45 degrees in my chair. That interesting approach to dining service was maintained throughout the meal including when she refilled my drink and brought the check. Very weird.

The salad arrived in a short time and was of good size. The greens used are obviously the same plastic bagged variety any of us can purchase in the market veggie aisle (couple of lettuce varieties, cabbage and carrot slivers...sound familiar?), some red pepper tossed in for color and artificial bacon bits. I had assumed the steak and fries would be warm. Wrong. Neither was much more than room temperature.

The server was bad enough but small flies/gnats hovered around my table and the one adjacent (just ask the family who mentioned it to me on their way out). It's usually a sign of poor cleanliness but I didn't want to hang around to see any more. The flies and the dirty menu were enough for me. 

So, obviously Angela didn't want to be at the restaurant on this day and did her best to make others feel the same. Had she been the least bit friendly the experience would have been OK. As it was, the inexpensive meal, at less than $15 included a tip that was twice what she deserved. I've no interest in returning or recommending to friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"We were told that we HAD to try Primanti's when we were in town. Everyone said they have the best sandwiches in town... so we gave it a try!

We visited Primanti's on a Friday night. We walked up and there was no wait. They were known for putting fries and coleslaw on the sandwich which makes them huge!

We all ordered the a sandwich, which took a while to come out. When they arrived, they were \"huge\". We decided to take off the fries and coleslaw and there was almost nothing left. A few slices of meat and cheese, which was expected. 

Also, this isn't a fast restaurant. We waited quite a bit for the food. If you are wanting to be in and out, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Hey not bad! Not bad at all! If you want a gut busting, filling, tasty meal on the cheap this is for you! They serve sandwiches. Yeah soup and wings and fries are there- but 90% of menu is sandwich- from egg to sardine to burger to all types of lunch meat.  Formula: thick cut fresh fluffy white bread that barely holds it all together; very tasty shredded vinegar slaw with nice horseradish kick; very fresh soft-fried fries (we call them Boardwalk style here- well cooked, browned, but not crispy- they are soft); fresh tomato, cheese- then the meat. I got fried fish; wife did pastrami; son did capicola. All very tasty and filling. Not high-class, not organic or sustainable or remotely low carb or low fat- but simple, filling, tasty, protein-carb calorie bomb to the gut!! Good beer on tap; few liquors at bat but they can't mix Manhattan (!). Service brusque but on point and quick to booze you up!!
So as a Ravens fan Baltimore boy I'll admit  Primantis is good! But Steelers still suck ass!!  Caw Caw!!!"}
{"text":"So this is our first time in Pittsburgh. Only a one-nighter and I don't figure we'll be here again. In that spirit we are trying to do Pittsburgian?...Pittsburghers?... type stuff. Just left its neighbor so round 2 of gluttony is here. Started off with Iron City beer. Yeah I know but I actually drank it back when the Texas Wisconsin Border Cafe was around. Ya know, when it was actually brewed in The 'Burgh. Next comes the Hot Chilli Bowl. Sorry but this may be the lamest attempt at \"chilli\" I've ever tasted...and I've eaten Army chilli. Now the wait begins for the sandwich.  \"Miss Personality\" delivered it about  20 minutes after ordering. Here is where this place redeemed itself. Pastrami on white bread with fries and kraut was frighin' phenomenal."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh staple. Got the Ragin' Cajun Chicken sandwich and a Victory Summer Luv to wash it down. Perfect alternative to paying the exuberant Arts Fest food prices. The sandwich was delicious and most filling. The Summer Luv is a yummy summer beer without being lemony or sweet or wheaty that complimented the Cajun Chicken nicely. So glad I elected to stick around town today after work."}
{"text":"So I was super excited to eat here. 
I had seen Primanti's on so many \"Best of\" shows finally, being in Pittsburgh last Christmas I got my chance. 

Now. I love old dive places. Places that clearly have history. Places where you can just feel how many families and friends have had truly special times there. All of the pictures on the wall. The raucous Steeler fans. I was in nostalgia heaven. 

With all of that said. I really wanted to love Primanti's, maybe I'm a snobby New Yorker. But.
Yeah.
I'm sorry Pittsburgh. 
Really i am. 
Don't hate me. 
I don't even want to say it. 
But....I didn't like my sandwich. 
The table of Pittsburgh kids I ate with were all in shock. But idk it really just didn't do it for me. 

Clearly it does it for thousands of Steel City residents everyday so decide for yourself."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a lot since it is next to our hotel. Angus sirloin sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich and the wings are good. Onion rings are great and the egg and cheese sandwich with capicola is yummy."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law, husband, and I visited this Primanti Bros from all the hype we'd been hearing about it. I have to say its overrated. I wasn't impressed with my sandwich at all. I ordered the chicken breast, my hubby got the fish, and my SIL got the steak. It had thick white bread, an overload of cole slaw, and fries. I don't think the \"meat\" you order makes a difference in the bland taste, as it's overpowered by the slaw and fries. The bread was dry on the crust and yet soggy from the slaw/oil from fries. The wait staff wasn't friendly either. They seemed to have the \"I don't need try to so hard because we're busy no matter what\" attitude. We had to go up to the bar to get refills on our drinks after waiting over 10 min. for the waitress to notice we were out. The place was constantly busy due to the full bar and nostalgic feel of the restaurant; it had it's own local charm. I'm glad to say I tried it, however I probably wouldn't go back on our next visit."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. The meat was over cooked so it was dry and tough. The sandwich as a whole, was way too salty for my liking with the fries and salted meat together. The bread reminded me of wonder bread, it wasn't dense enough to hold the meat and slaw. All in all it was disappointing and a place I could've done without eating at. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed!! 

After hearing about Primanti Bros from everyone that has ever stepped foot in Pittsburgh, I made a point of going to the original location and having the \"Pittsburgh experience\". I had visions of grandeur...

My boyfriend ordered the pastrami and I ordered the Pittsburgh \"cheese steak\" which is totally misleading, but the waiter explained what it was, and I LOVE egg on my cheeseburger so I was all in. I don't like coleslaw, but I thought, \"No, you have to have the whole experience, get it with coleslaw\". 
In all fairness, the coleslaw was the most flavorful part of my sandwich. I pushed it off towards the end though because I couldn't taste anything else. The pastrami sandwich was slightly more flavorful, but not much.

I've been there, done that. I don't need to go back. The owners are some lucky lucky people... Fill sandwiches with cheap fries and coleslaw instead of meat, don't worry with washing plates or the expense of paper plates and make lots of money. All the hype keeps them in business I guess. 

Thank goodness I saved our trip to Fat Heads until the end of the trip. They renewed my faith in Pittsburgh food!!!"}
{"text":"I realize this is not the original Strip District location and might lack in charm somewhat.  However, when you live any place that does not have a Primanti Brothers nearby, charm takes a back seat to food.  And the food here is good.  

They have pizza, salads, and more conventional sandwiches, if you wish. But why would you wish?  This is the place to order the prototypical Primanti Brothers sandwich: meat, cheese, cole slaw, and fries all between the two slices of excellent bread.   Be warned that the sandwiches are huge and thick, so it takes some effort to eat them.

Service is quite speedy.  The noise factor can be high - I had to ask if they could turn down the music a bit so that we could hear each other.  They complied, but the volume slowly crept up.  Not a deal breaker - I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying \"fries inside the sandwich!!!!' so what?!?!? Even Burger King puts fries inside their sandwich now....doesn't mean it's good!

There was a time that Primanti  was probably the best. There was a time that their sandwiches were probably jaw dropping and awe-inspiring however, that time has passed.

Much like a Pat's or Geno's here we have another iconic Pennsylvania restaurant that by name alone manages to draw crowds and visitors. And much like Pat's and Geno's these once inventive sandwiches have been recreated and remade by countless others who have actually improved on the original recipes. So what do these iconic names do to retain their prestige?!?!? Nothing! No changes, no improvement they just live off the what was....and some how it continues to work for them?!?!? 

I had the Primanti Cheese Steak: Cheese, Steak, Egg, Fries, Slaw, Tomato. Fries could have been good if seasoned. Egg was a nice surprise...I forgot they did that. Steak was meh! 

I'm not sure that going to a place to \"say I've been there\" or \"for the experience\" is good enough anymore...the experience of what?!?! Subpar food?!?!? Yay me, I settled for crap!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich, but could use more meat.  Sandwich was mostly fries and slaw.  The French fries were great and bread was fresh.  This location gets busy, so give yourself plenty of time."}
{"text":"Authentic sandwiches fills you up. A good place to stop when visiting Pittsburgh. The Market Square location is close to downtown shopping and dining."}
{"text":"Inconsistent.  Sometimes the service and food is great sometimes the food is over cooked and the service is just ok.  The place has never been packed when we went in so that wasn't the issue.  I think they have expanded the franchise and lost the magic of the original place.  The quality of the ingredients doesn't seem to be the best either.  I think they rely on the tourist factor and their name recognition more than the fact they still make great food."}
{"text":"Ya gotta do it, just to say you've experienced it.

If you're in a hurry make sure you sit at the bar, as you can get in and out in ~15 minutes if the line is short. Also most of the people in the line are waiting for a table, so if you're sick of waiting have someone check out the bar space.

The cheesesteak wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but still delicious regardless. Never been a big cole slaw kinda guy as I don't like large quantities of mayo or cabbage, especially together but the cole slaw here IS good.

Don't forget like many other wonderful establishments this place is CASH only!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after a night of having a bit too much to drink and it was the best cure for any ill-feelings. I had the double egg and cheese and he had the capricola. We were speechless as we ate, which is always a good sign that we're too busy enjoying the food. The service was fast and friendly and we couldn't ask for much more than that! Would highly recommend it as a must-do when you come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I drove over 4 hours to experience this place....n it was beyond worth it! I'm not a fan of cole slaw cuz of the mayo but the vinegar based slaw on the sandwich was mighty tasty."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Was very excited to finally visit the place after seeing it on tv. I was hungry and ready for a big sandwich. We ordered a couple different sandwiches to try. I am not a big Cole slaw fan but decided when in Rome...  The sandwiches were good, not great. The bread was awesome, nice and fresh. The meats were good, and the Cole slaw was ok. The two biggest disappointments to me were the fries (they were awful - soggy and bland) and the sandwiches were not that big. I was hungry when I left. I would go back again but not get the Cole slaw and fries on the sandwich. The bread is sooooo good I am craving another sandwich. My faves were the double egg & cheese and the corned beef sandwich. The fountain coke was really good by the way."}
{"text":"If you can't make it to some of the older, or original locations this location will do just fine. The food was pretty good, and there are definitely some pros to the suburban restaurants vs the urban locations. Our favorite thing to do is split and share two sandwiches (each get a half of the others.)

1. Knife to cut your own sandwich. This is GREAT! Our kids eat a little over half of their own sandwich and take the rest home. Now we can cut our own size sandwich for the kids without it getting overly messy. (Cut in half, and cut the other half perpendicular, or just cut a 3/4 sandwich.)

2. Bright, open, and clean location.

3. Ragin' Cajun sandwich was most definitely not ragin' at all. I feel it was very under-seasoned, not spicy at all. This is one of our favorite sandwiches and we were surprised how lacking in spiciness it was.

4. Fairly popular for college football games. Random people clapping and cheering at the wide variety of screens available. When we entered it was about 1/3 filled and quiet, but slowly the tables started to fill. The random clapping and hollering startled us the first few times."}
{"text":"Underwhelming is one word that comes to mind. The meat tasted cheap, the fries were soggy and the sandwich as a whole was pretty tasteless.
Maybe my expectations were just too high, I don't know. I went bc I had to, but I definitely will skip next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"John Michael the bartender took great cafe of me. It was slow on a Friday afternoon then picked up quickly. Was always there to slide me my next Miller Lite. Thanks brother nice meeting you. 

Food is always amazing. If you haven't had a Primanti Brothers sandwich you are missing the boat!!!"}
{"text":"I should know after being disappointed at Monroeville and North Versailles that Homestead wouldn't make the grade either.   Cold limp fries, skimpy coleslaw.  Yuck. 

Nothing is better than the original on 18th.  Why try."}
{"text":"It's not all the hype they make it out to be. I really tried to like it as much as I hoped I would. We traveled to Pittsburgh for a week from California and this was our last spot to check out before leaving. My boyfriend, brother's and myself were all disappointed. The sandwich bread was too dry and I ordered the Pitts-Burgher cheese steak. To my surprise I figured it would be thin slices of steak and it happened to be a beef patty, which happened to be very dry and bland.

I agree with what many have pointed out that sandwiches have 50 percent coleslaw. The only thing we really liked were the smallman street fries that come with chili, cheese, bacon and sour cream. My brothers ordered the pastrami and they said they've had better even and fast food hamburger chains. My Pitts-Burgher 
May look good but don't let the looks fool you."}
{"text":"Spent a night in Pittsburgh on our way from NY to Norton, Ohio.  Heard all about these sandwiches, needed to give it a go while here.  

We spent a weekend in Philly in December, thought maybe this was a rival sandwich to the cheesesteak.  It is not.  We split the Pitts-burger, very dry, even with the recommended hot sauce.  It tasted more like meat-loaf than a burger, not even some cole-slaw and fries on the actual sandwich could salvage this - imagine how bad it must be if even that can't help.  We had an order of Buffalo wings as well, they would have to be included in a conversation of the worst wings we've ever had.  The tater-tots were great, should definitely stay on the menu.  

The service and the beer selection was fine, especially the service.  Glasses were never empty for long, they would even ask to fill up right before you were done.  Super helpful to any questions we may have had.  We were immediately seated, even though they were swamped and working their asses off.

So all the stars are for the service and beer, the sandwich is not something I would do again, unlike some of those Philly cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Had to try it when my Steelers fan-friend said it's a must do if you can only eat in Pitt once.

But as our only meal in the city on a quick stop, I must say I was quite disappointed. The famous corned beef sandwich was very average. Bland, average bread...

I didn't care for the soggy fries they put on top of it. Basically, if I'm gonna eat something that has 10k calories in it, it better be orgasmic... This sandwich left me with \"taste bud blue balls.\"

Props for being open 24-7, parking lot, and  having large portions... but I wouldn't rush to go back.

Boo, for cash only!"}
{"text":"There is no better sandwich you can have after leaving Mario's for the night. The service is quick and the food is exactly what you need to fulfill your late night hunger!"}
{"text":"First time to Primanti Brothers.
I ordered Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak Sandwich at lunch time.
It was huge sandwich and difference between the other sandwich shop was fries are inside of your sandwich.
Also taste of salad inside of your sandwich was little sour to me.
If you want to experience different taste for sandwich, I strongly recommend Primanti Brothers.
I will stop by Primanti Brothers for next trip again."}
{"text":"Great service and selection of crazy sandwich options. If you don't love coleslaw, fries, and tomatoes on a pile of meat and cheese, between two fluffy pieces of bread, this isn't for you."}
{"text":"Dbl Roast and Cheddar was awesome! No wait on a Monday night while I guess the city was all at the penguins game. First time trying this place after a friends recommendation on a 1 night trip to Pittsburgh. Delicious, thick sandwich served quick!"}
{"text":"After watching the Man v. Food episode of Pittsburgh(yes I do enjoy that show) I was thrilled when I went on a trip to Pittsburgh for a convention that is held there every year in the summer time.The friends who I was staying with made it a goal to go to Primanti during our visit and indeed we did. We decided on mostly the same sandwich all around which was the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak and their signature fries. We were not disappointed at all with the meal as it was tasty and delicious, although we may have needed two to fill us up! I'm usually not one for cole slaw or tomatoes but my sandwich alone was delicious enough to eat the entire thing!"}
{"text":"Although there are several locations, Primantis is a Pittsburgh Must See!"}
{"text":"A lot of times, superior experiences will immediately hit you over the head with how awesome they are. You knew after the first time that you beat Super Mario Brothers or touched a boob that something pretty spectacular had just happened. 

Primanti Bros wasn't quite like that. I saw the sandwich on TV and built expectations up insanely high. Upon arrival, we noted that the restaurant itself had a pretty cool set-up with the long diner-style counter... they served beer... they had plenty of hot sauce... all great news. But the cheesesteak was... different. The meat was more like a run-of-the-mill hamburger puck, though on great bread with a variety of glorious non-traditional toppings. The fries were a spectaular sandwich addition, and the slaw was not at all like the usual gag-inducing mayo-heavy concoction. There was a whirlwind of emotions and analysis as the sandwich and my expectations came to terms, then it all sunk in-- it was damn good!!-- and by that point it was gone. 

I had another each night for three nights, and by the end of the third, I was furious that I had to leave Pittsburgh. I had only tried the cheesesteak and there were so many other sandwiches to try! The cheesesteak was great, however-- a real trendsetter. Sure, the Southside Slopes at Fat Heads is a phenomenal sandwich, but you couldn't enjoy one every day like you could a Primanti Bros sandwich, and that's part of the charm. The other part is that you can't get these sandwiches anywhere else (outside of Ft. Lauderdale, but who's keeping track?). That makes for one damn charming sandwich experience. Bon apetit."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Many try to copy it, but it just can't be done. Okay, I admit you have to have a taste for it. I have found many non locals who don't enjoy it. Me, I'm from Wheeling, so I consider myself part Pittsburgh and yes, Primanti Brothers is awesome. This is the original one, my personal favorite. They have fancier ones with bigger menus in other locations, but this is real deal and they don't mess around with their menu. It's sandwiches, fries, chili, and a few other things. I love the Cajun chicken, and the cheesesteak. My husband loves the fish. This is cash only and parking can be rough sometimes, but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. No gimmick so there is no time or money wasted on the unimportant things. This was an amazing sandwich that was beyond well priced. My wife and I both had the New Yorker. I can not stress enough how amazing this sandwich was."}
{"text":"This is the original location so it's definitely a tourist destination.  The menu doesn't have as many options as their chains.  Personally I like that it doesn't have that \"chain restaurant feel\".  

If you are going to try Primanti's just once in your life.  This is the location I would recommend.  The food is delicious and tastes even better after a few beers.

Primanti's is an experience not just a restaurant."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple. Just try one. It is everything you know you shouldn't eat all on one sandwich. Although I can't say I would hands down eat one at any chance I could, its one of those things you must check off your bucket list."}
{"text":"Worst service with horrible food. Never coming back here again! The lady that hosts you is the rudest person I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Expected More
The food was good but for being famous I was expecting out of this world. It was good but nothing really spectacular."}
{"text":"I love primantis. But the original location in the strip is not worth to go to. I believe it's more of a \"tourist trap\". The quality of the food and service isn't as good as their other locations that I have been too. I would recommend going to a different location if you want to try a great sandwich. The harmerville has always been good."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh and decided to try this place since it comes so highly recommended. Neither I nor my husband understood the hype about this place. The sandwich didn't really have much flavor and I would have rather just had the fries on the side with some malt vinegar. It did the trick of filling me up, but that's about it. We'd probably never go back."}
{"text":"I've tried a bunch of different locations and they each have their own vibe. I prefer the sports bar vibe in N Versailles over the family restaurant vibe that some of the other locations possess. Primantis' is great for watching the game, drinking cold beer and eating their famous sandwiches. If you order an entree then you're missing the whole reason why Primanti Bros is famous! Order the piled high Roast Beef with tomato, fries and slaw and enjoy one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have!"}
{"text":"I can see why people come here....the prices are great and the sandwiches are huge....after the bf saw Primanti Bros on one of the food networks, he made it a point to have a sandwich here when we made an overnight stop in Pittsburgh.  The waitress recommended the pastrami, so we shared it....I wasn't sure how this whole fries and slaw thing was going to work, but it did...it was tasty and yummy."}
{"text":"We just can't put on pounds fast enough, the Primanti Brothers were likely thinking when considering what to put on the menu. How can we inject the maximum amount of calories in the shortest amount of time into our customers? Their solution is Pittsburgh's most famous sandwich.......

Sandwiches topped with french fries, cole slaw, tomatoes and onions by request.

Next up in the sandwich's evolution? Coca-cola soaked bread? Chocolate shake dressing? We'll have to see...

In the meantime, worth a try for the novelty aspect. If the concept doesn't interest you, pass it up."}
{"text":"When first arrived in Pittsburgh, I heard rumors of this mythical \"Primanti Bros\" and of the brave men who had gone to slay the dragons that lurked therein, only to be dealt ignominious defeat by way of too much food for even the manliest of men to handle at once.  When I went, therefore, I approached the estabishment with mixed eagerness and trepidation.

My greatest fears and greatest hopes were confirmed: food, food, and more food.  Sandwiches as big as your head, filled with fresh-cut french fries, vinegary cole slaw, deli meat piled high, and at least 1000% of the daily recommendations for fat, sodium, and moral fiber.  I plowed ahead, entering uncharted culinary waters for the sake of glory -- and science.  And I staggered out a little bit wiser -- and probably much closer to death by myocardial infarct.  Glorious!

In sum, if you happen to belong to the (apparently very extensive) set of people who (a) value stupendously large sandwiches packed with more cholesterol than sense and (b) do not value their coronary arteries, then this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"Can't drive through Pittsburgh and not grab a sammich.  That's turkey, ham and bacon with an egg Cole slaw cheese and tomatoes called \"The get porked\". My husband had the pastrami and he says it is totally worth getting fat for."}
{"text":"If you want to get full and eat something unique this is the place. You get coleslaw and fries on your sandwich and it works. Truly a slice of pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Pittsburgh area, but moved away when I was 16, so I never got to explore the city like I wanted to. The first time I returned, though, I went to Primanti Bros. in the Strip District, and I've become a regular there since. Every time I pass through the Fort Pitt Tunnel when I arrive back in town, I make a bee line through downtown to the Strip District for a roast beef sandwich! The meat and fries are salty, and the cole slaw is tangy, and the two flavors work well together. It's basically a meal in the form of a sandwich, and I've never had one that I didn't like.

Sometimes I get the sense that many people who don't like Primanti Bros. are either gourmands who don't know how to appreciate \"bar food,\" or people who have some sort of problem with the culture of Pittsburgh, and thus target Primanti Bros. because it's promoted by the locals as the city's signature food item. But that's their loss. I think it's great bar food, and I've promoted it to people who have never been to Pittsburgh. One person I know from small-town south Georgia went to Pittsburgh a year and a half ago on business, and he tried Primanti Bros. and liked it a lot.

Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll be back on 18th Street in the Strip District getting my grub on and enjoying life!"}
{"text":"I go to Primanti's about once per month, and it has to be a horrible day for me to go- one of those sleep deprived, headachey Mondays. On those days, Primanti's is what picks me back up. I almost always get a hot sausage sandwich with fried egg, and there's no better comfort food on earth- it's an earthquake of spicy, meaty, blue-collar goodness. It's ambrosia to my rust-belt soul.

I'm very sad seeing the number of horrible reviews people have given this place. I'm a current customer, so I know it's not the case that the place has just \"gone downhill\" or whatever. I don't know what people are expecting when they walk in the door, but it's clear that a lot of folks aren't quite getting the magic of the place and its food. It's been said that Pittsburgh has a \"nostalgia-industrial complex\", and maybe that's part of it: I go to Primanti's when I need to remind myself of who I am, where I've come from, and where I'm going. I know that that sounds terribly hokey, but it's the honest-to-God truth. Going to Primanti's is like going back home after a hard day, and seeing people trash it in their reviews gives me the same feeling I imagine I'd get if I saw someone belittling their own child's artwork: the point isn't to decide whether it's a world-class technical masterpiece... the point is to enjoy it for its uniqueness and its idiosyncrasies."}
{"text":"This place gets stars because it is open 24 HOURS!! Yes. All the time. I wish it served a variety of foods, but sadly they just do sandwiches. Still, The fish sandwich was great and so was the coleslaw, which is not mayo-based but more kraut-like or middle eastern style. The fries in the sandwich were actually a nice touch too."}
{"text":"After all of the hype and a long trip from Cincinnati, I was fairly disappointed in the food. I got the Pittsburgh-er (spelling?) which apparently is the #2 best seller. My brother informed me that Yuengling or beer in general is the #1 best seller. And at the price I am not surprised! A 23 oz Yuengling was only about $2.35 or so!

We walked through the main entrance through the bar and into the back. It is interesting when people smoke in bars in other states since it is illegal in Ohio (I don't agree or disagree with it). I am glad that the restaurant portion of the place was smoke free. Bars I can deal with, but not restaurants.

The food was relatively bland, but increased dramatically when I dipped it in ketchup. I may try to get hot sauce on it next time to add some flavor. I don't really see what is so special about the sandwich. I mean, I am sure restaurants around the country have put coleslaw and french fries on top of a burger without being inspired by Primanti Bros. I favor Skyline (a Cincinnati chain) more than Primanti Bros. and I favor Hudepohl Amber Lager more than Yuengling (don't get me wrong, I did enjoy Yuengling very much). And I know you could say it is because I am from Cincinnati and my bias shows, but I will admit I loved the city of Pittsburgh when I was there.

My boss (who is from Pittsburgh) said the original Primanti Bros. in \"the Strip\" is better. I don't know if it actually is better, or if he was just saying that so that I would not dislike one of his hometown favorites. I will try the one in the Strip when I go back next time."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Market Square Primanti's this weekend after a Pirates game.  Salami sandwich was out of this world, and the 24 oz. IC Light wasn't too shabby, either.  Great post-10pm food!"}
{"text":"I live in Atlanta and, as far as I know, we don't have anything comparable to a Primanti Bros. sandwich nearby.  There is just nothing like it.  That being said, I have to go to Primanti Bros. every time I am in Pitt on a business trip.

My favorite has to be the Pastrami, but I have tried a different sandwich each time and I have never... ever... been disappointed.  The fries are good and the cole slaw is out of control.  Throw all that on some Italian bread and... 

I'm speechless.  

I can't wait to taste you again, Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"Prior to writing my review for Primanti Bros., I put on my helmet, tooth guard, started my car and prepared to run away once the angry hordes of Pittsburghers read my review...Why you ask?   Get ready for it....deep breath...

I...don't...like...Primantis...

Gasp!  Choke!  Faint!

Yes, yes, I know.  As a born and bred Pittsburgher, I am committing blasphemy by admitting I don't like Primantis.  I don't like their sandwiches, I don't like their nachos, I don't like their soups, salads, wings or fries.  I find the whole idea of a sandwich containing 3,000 calories worth of Italian bread, cole slaw, meat, and fries just too over the top.  The fries are a soggy mess, the slaw has too much vinegar, the meats are cheap, and the bread is...well the bread is actually ok.

I know it's a Pittsburgh institution and it even served a very pragmatic purpose back in the day, but now it's just kitsch that gets the city featured on Food Network on occasion.  I've eaten there numerous times and have done my Pittsburgh duty of taking all out of towners to the (in)famous Primanti's, but always with the caveat that, \"It's not that good.\" and usually an apology afterward.

So there you have it.  I do feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I no longer have to carry around my terrible, terrible secret."}
{"text":"I went here about three years ago and had the \"original\" which is some sort of cheese steak, mystery meat sandwich. It was awful--I have no idea what the meat actually was. I swore I would never come back to this place, but I decided to give it another try. This location was way nicer inside than the one on Carson street, which I thought was weird since this is the original, and what I thought was the oldest Primanti Bros. 
The service is typical Pittsburgh service. A slight chip on the shoulder, somehow laid back and uptight at the same time. We got there around 11:30 am, which was right before the Sunday rush started. 
This time I tried the Corned beef with cheese. One of these days I'm going to try the sardine sandwich, but after a night of binge drinking on Carson... The corned beef was to die for. The best corned beef I have ever had, actually. As with the last time, the bread is also really delicious. It's soft, flavorful and yeasty. What throws me is the coleslaw/ fries on the sandwich. I know that's what actually makes it Primanti's, but I'm not a huge coleslaw fan to begin with, and I really don't think their fries are that good. The fries are too soft and have almost a sweet, off putting flavor. I understand the thought process/ history behind putting everything ON the sandwich, but it really is not my ideal way to eat. 
Stay away from the cheese steak, stick with the other meat choices!"}
{"text":"Alright, I have dreaded writing this review ever since returning from our trip because i loved Pittsburgh and the amazing people who live there that we were able to make friends with. I don't want to show any disrespect, so lets get that out of the way. My buddies and I went into this experience blind. We were later told by locals that we needed to visit Primanti Bros. after several drinks and not sober, but unfortunately our experience was sober. With that said here we go.....

The service was not that great. Folks seemed grumpy. I was shocked because the folks we met in Pittsburgh were some of the friendliest i have met in all my travels across the United States.

Capicola and Cheese- First off the coleslaw is more of a kraut then coleslaw. The capicola tasted like bologna and didn't resemble any capicola i've ever eaten. The french fries were soggy.

Roast Beef and Cheese- I didn't try it, but my buddy said it was the worst variation of a roast beef he's ever tried.

Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak- This one is on us, but to put cheesesteak on anything for outsiders of Penn. people are thinking thinly sliced delicious rib-eye... not ground beef. Nonetheless it was the worst of all of the sandwiches.

Like i said we tried this place sober and everyone who we told our story to said that we should have drank first. I would like to give it a second chance, but my first impressions are sadly not very good."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad for this review since this is a Pittsburgh staple, but I don't since this place is SO DIRTY. Holy crap, are the floors ever cleaned? Are the tables? I know I walked in at 10 PM, but it's a 24-hour joint so what gives?? The floors were DISGUSTING and full of old cabbage and other food particles everywhere. The tables were dirty, but less than the floor so I was definitely better off eating off the table. The sandwiches come wrapped with no plates, etc., which is probably part of the problem. The whole place is messy and disgusting from start to finish.

Also, I'm sorry I don't like the sandwiches, but I don't. They're so, so, so dry. There's a little bit of meat and cheese (like three slices of meat?) and the rest is just fries, bread, and coleslaw. The coleslaw does not have enough vinegar to cut through the dry fries and dry bread. Eating my sandwich felt like a chore, but I was so hungry that I powered through it with the aid of a lot of ketchup.

I guess it's nice that the sandwiches are so cheap, but I sure see no reason to ever return."}
{"text":"Old fashioned sandwich shop.  Landmark in Pittsburgh, in the district.  Little overated, but still good.  Touristy."}
{"text":"As good as advertised.  The sandwiches are big with quality cuts of meat.  I thought the slaw was delicious too adding a little vinegary tang to the fries.  Great atmosphere and friendly wait staff,"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The cole slaw was so delicious. SOOOOO delicious. Especially in the sandwich with the pastrami (I had a pastrami sandwich btw). But the fries in the sandwich were Eh. I wish they were seasoned better, but i think i would have enjoyed it better on the side. Overall, it was super tasty and the next time i'm in Pittsburgh, most definitely going here again."}
{"text":"Sandwiches look pretty good, service is pretty bad, I asked if I could get an egg over easy, and the staff said what's that. I explained it to them, and still didn't get what I wanted. I felt really uneasy in this place, and didn't want to talk to the staff any further, so I got up and walked out. Never going back. I know these guys are a staple of PGH, but the staff felt pretty dumb to me."}
{"text":"For the cost this is a really good sandwich. I would like to think it's the only good thing in Pittsburgh and it might just be ;) I got their main sandwich which is the pittsburger, and the slaw could use more mayo. The bread was absolutely delightful, and the fries added a nice element to your average sandwich. Be sure to get mayo and hot sauce with it! Overall wasn't too bad"}
{"text":"Went in for beer and wings. The wings were good got them on $5 after 9 special and had the nightly beer special. The only problem was a mixup on the order and being billed twice but the server took care of it quick and friendly. I really like this location . When I come from out of town this place is a go to."}
{"text":"Was in town last weekend and stopped by Primanti Brothers in the Strip District based on the countless times I've seen it featured on tv. I had to try the Pitts-burger which is their burger with cole slaw and french fries added. Sometimes with tv shows they hype up a place that just ends up being \"meh\". However, Primanti's is one of those places that actually fits the hype.

The place has a nostalgic feel to it, kind of like a renovated bar from the old days. Surrounded by drawings of famous people who have come to Primanti's (this is the original location), we sat at the counter to order. The people behind the counter were friendly and helpful. 

We ordered the Pitts-burger which is the #2 seller. The slaw is not creamy but rather vinegary which added a nice sour taste to the savoriness of the burger itself. Of course, adding fries to the burger is a win! It's simple and very good so I can see why our friends who had visited Pittsburgh all told us to try Primanti's. It's a staple in two and has a great history serving some really good food."}
{"text":"Drove from Detroit to see a Tigers/Pirates baseball game, and decided to stop at the Man v. Food locations while there - Primanti Bros. was my least favorite. I wound up getting the pastrami sandwich, and I didn't care for it much at all. For about $7, you get a DECENT size sandwich - not nearly as big as what's shown on MvF - with DECENT flavor. Not a great value, and not the best sandwich in the world, but if you've seen Man v. Food, I'd recommend going just to say you went there. Really though, don't expect anything mind-blowing - Adam definitely overdoes his reaction on the show. Absolutely average."}
{"text":"If you had asked me 5,10, 15 years ago I'd of said 4-5 stars without a doubt!  Yet when I go to Primanit's (always taking friends from out of town) I am unimpressed.  I guess many places have been cutting back while raising prices so I shouldn't be surprised, but Primanti's should be above this as an iconic place that seems to always be featured when Food Network \"stars\" venture to the city of bridges.  
But alas, Primanti's has dwindled to below average in my mind and always leaves me hungry for something better.  Their \"sammiches\" used to be piled high with good meats, slaw, and fries and are now a shadow of their former selves.  A carnivore would not be happy with the finger full of meat presented on the sandwich.  The coleslaw and fries are still top notch, but the often rude and ever busy staff, the higher prices, the swelling pride, and lean portions of animal proteins have me buying their slaw and making my own Pittsburgh sammiches at home!"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros. is never a bad choice. Great food and great place to watch sports. They always have good beer specials and recently added specials for after 9pm. The happy hour is always a plus, being half off all drinks. If you have never been to Primanti's before, you must try one of their famous sandwiches, piled high with whatever meat you want, French fries, cole slaw, and tomatoes. The Pittsburgher is their number two best seller, with their number one seller being Iron City beer. If you live in Pittsburgh and have never been to Primanti's before, you should go ASAP.  If you are a visitor, this should definitely be on your list to visit while you are in town!"}
{"text":"The only reason you should go there is to take a picture, not to eat. The food was just not that good. I guess their history makes it fun, but not worth eating at."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any more Pittsburgh than this!  Five stars for \"local flavor\" and friendly, efficient service and three stars for the food.  Unless of course, you were born and raised in Western PA, then I'm guessing you'd award 4-5 stars for the sandwich that everyone around here is eating.  

Spoiler alert for the rest of you, it's just not that good.  Two pieces of plain white bread, with a thin layer of meat (corned beef, pastrami & capicola are the crowd favorites), cheese, plain coleslaw, a pile of french fries (yes, french fries) and a tomato slice between them.  Just blah, layered on top of blah, layered on top of blah.  The meatball sub is actually pretty good.  The chili is very good, but spicy, so get the cheese, onions and sour cream to tame the beast.  

Limited beer selection, but great prices and I'd never complain about an ice cold 22oz Yuengling Black & Tan.  Good sangria, too!"}
{"text":"Everyone, I mean Everyone tells you to eat at this Primanti Bros when you are in Pittsburg. So I did, twice in fact, once here at the stadium and once at the one in the strip district. I don't see the ahhh or the oooooh about these sandos. They are fine if I'm being nice. WHich I am. 

I think the little stand in the corner behind you with the craved pork sandwich on the soft roll is better but I didn't try it. I was too busy crying in my tears after Pittsburg kicked the 49ers ass. On the flip side they sell beer just about anywhere in this stadium unlike the city where getting a beer can be a mission. How is it that Pittsburg doesn't sell beer in Liquor stores? Meanwhile at the stadium you can get a beer about every ten feet. Dudes are walking around carrying buckets of beer. It just doesn't make sense.  

So yeah get a beer and skip the sandwich."}
{"text":"Sorry to have bothered you....

I don't even know where to begin.  I really wish I had the option to give negative stars.  I have NEVER had such a horrible experience at a restaurant.  We were from out of town visiting some friends and decided to go to the downtown location for lunch after shopping the strip.  We walk in and are pointed to a table to go to from a dark haired waitress who looked like we were interrupting her relaxation and wanted to be any where but there.  Our lovely table was situated between an overflowing garbage can and the wall where the menu was located.  As I crank my head around to attempt to read the menu another cranky blonde waitress comes over barking at us for our drink order.  We asked if we could split the check and were sternly informed we could tell them what we had when we checked out.  We get our drinks and are again barked at to place our food order.  At this point the garbage keeps getting more and more overflowing and my friend is disgusted so we moved to the table next to us which was empty along with pretty much every other table in the place.  Dark haired waitress looks at us like we just crapped on the floor.   I take a sip from my drink and look at the lemon and notice it is covered in dirt.  As blonde waitress plops down soggy fries to two people in our party I nicely inform her about the nasty lemon and without so much of an apology she takes my drink to begrudgingly make me a new one.  At this point I am thoroughly in shock by how rude the staff has been.  Then as the two in our party are finishing their soggy fries a gentleman comes out to deliver the rest of our order.  He is shouting names of items we did not order and is getting more and more aggravated we do not know what he is talking about.  Finally I tell him he might want to treat his costumers with a little more respect.  We finally figure out the items and he plops down sandwiches on what seems to be wax paper where half of the fries fly on the table which I could only assume has not been cleaned well by the staffs lack of motivation.  We were all confused by the sandwiches as we were never informed that the fries we were getting were actually on the sandwich along with a big lump of coleslaw that tasted like it was all vinegar.  My one friend ordered a Pittsburger which seemed to be what she described as a \"dehydrated mystery meat\" and couldn't even eat it.  She was however still thirsty and being she ran out of soda 10 minutes prior and no one asked if she wanted a refill I called the dark haired waitress over and asked her if she could get one.  She literally rolled her eyes and sighed.  At that point I mentioned I was so sorry to bother her.  It got to the point I really wanted to speak to a manager but with the demeanor of everyone we encountered I figured it was pointless.  We went to check out where the rude gentleman could not read our ticket and we left.  I'm a big tipper everywhere we go even if we have to wait for our food or if a waitress gets backed up and can't take care of us right away because that typically is not their fault and everyone has off days, I worked in the restaurant business, I know how it goes but this was literally unbelievable and the worst dining experience I ever had.  I almost thought we were on a hidden tv show because it was so bad.  Needless to say I waked out without giving them any sort of a tip and would never give them a dime of my business again.  A hint Primanti Brothers people do not have to give them your business I support local businesses because I'd like to see them survive but with your staff's attitude good luck with that.  I'm assuming you do survive because the drunks that go there after the club don't give a shit as to their service or the quality of food just something to fill the void."}
{"text":"Uff I'm from Texas and we have nothing like this in our city... I highly recommend this place. Staff was great and friendly and informative. I had a beer with mine. I did have to add ketchup but you don't have too. Kudos to the owner"}
{"text":"Horrible food and service! The fries and the coleslaw in the sandwich were the worst part. The bread was soggy. Waitress touched my bread and left finger marks on. This was probably invented by someone who did not have anything else to cook."}
{"text":"Combined review.

Primanti in Cranberry on Freedom Road.   

Service was about  a 2 on the 4 times we went there.
Parking excellent however.  Easy to get there, and find a space.

Food -- well, just a variant of Olive Garden's canned/packaged materials.  

A nice place to visit.  And an okay place to eat.  

But against real competition in the foodie world, not so much.

Jeff"}
{"text":"Well, I wanted a place to hang out a bit and wait for the Sander's event on the square.  Service was excellent.  This however was the worst food I've experience ever.  Two big slabs of white bread, then an inch or more of fries....  I asked for a knife and fork to help find the meat,  

Waiters/waitress excellent.  But the food is horrible.  McDonald's is far better.  And I do not at all like McDonald's....   

This is a venue on the Square?

{"text":"I was in town for a wedding,  and from what I was told by people I asked in Pittsburgh,  I had to try Primanti Brothers. I saw the restaurant featured on Man vs Food on the Travel Channel as well.

I took the groom to be and a fellow groomsmen there a few days before the wedding for a manly meal of oversized sandwiches and beer. From the moment we walked in, we knew we would like this establishment. They have plenty of televisions to watch sports while you wait for your food.

I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and it definitely did not disappoint. My friends got burgers and they liked them as well. The sandwiches are piled high with slaw and fries. It definitely is something different,  but in a good way.

Overall, I'm glad we decided to try this Pittsburgh establishment. I will make sure to stop by next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fries on a sandwich. Pittsburgh classic that anyone needs to try."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to Primanti's, because who doesn't like a big ol' delicious sandwich with fries and slaw heaped on? This location is well-kept...I was meeting an old friend I served in the military with for lunch. The server was friendly and efficient, and she kept tabs on us. It was opening time when we strolled in, so the place was clean. Both of our sandwiches were tasty as usual, and the extras of onion rings good!
Great job, all around! One to return to!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff...works for me everytime! Nothing says Picksburgh like a Primanti's n'at!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Primanti's locations...from the original in the Strip years ago, to Oakland, Harmar, Moon Twp, Robinson, Grove City and North Versailles. Been to one, been to them all, to tell you the truth. Their \"formula\" seems set in stone wherever you go - and you know what? That's not a bad thing, because they're great.
I'm pretty sure they sell stuff besides their sandwiches, but that's of no mind to me. Pastrami and cheese man here. They're all delicious though, and here's a secret - get a designated driver because they taste even better in proportion to the number of beers you've had! Shhh!!!
Seriously, not a bad experience yet, and I've been to their spots plenty of times. It's all good, so go there with your friends or family and enjoy great food, good atmosphere, and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Worst primantis location by far. Upon arrival , my family and i stepped over chicken , fench fries , napkins and wrappers all over the floor in the middle of the dining area.  Our waitress , santara , wasnt friendly at all and had no pep in her step . we ordered Queso and chips to start - the chips came out soft and rubbery . they were never dried , the were saturated in fryer grease. We told our server who took our chips and let our cheese sit on the table . 20 minutes later , my sandwich & my fiances wings came out - and the chips from our appetizer were no where to be seen . the waitress that brought our dinner out(not santara) then took our cheese only to reheat it and reserve it with my chips that came another 15 minutes after my main course. Filthy , rude employees , crap service and the food was hardly warm wheb it came out . GROSS ."}
{"text":"There is NO SANDWICH other than a Primanti's sandwich. This is perhaps one of the greatest restaurants in America. It is incredible, incredible fare for what it is. It's a working-class Pittsburgh joint at heart, so if you want your rump kissed and a quick seating at a plush table, skip it... but if you like FOOD, this place is for you. Cash only! An outstanding selection of delectable meats, cole slaw that's a uniquely savory vinegary glory of goodness, and fries right on the bread. Eat it together, and relish in the complexity of the taste. It's a phenomenal selection. I'm a pastrami man as a rule when I go here, but I've had terrific experiences with the angus, roast beef, corned beef (outstanding) capicola (particularly excellent), and kolbassi (very, very good) as well. The pastrami is exceptional in my opinion. And yeah, I've been here that many times. It's a MUST-GO in the 'burgh. Notes: Treat your server like gold. Watch how hard she's working! NEVER say no to the baklava; it's the best I've ever had. ($1 on a tray from grandma. Perfect!) When it's cold out, keep the door closed or prepare to be yelled at. No, you can't seat yourself, so stop asking. And for the love of god, YES it's worth the wait! Get in line!"}
{"text":"While here on a community service road trip, my friends and I dined at this location. I tried the Ragin Cajun Chicken Breast and Cheese sandwich which was well-worth the 6.99. It came with a moderate helping of coleslaw and tomatoes as well. It was really delicious and the meat was seasoned very well. Would definitely recommend to  people new or visiting the area as it is a unique restaurant among all the fast food and other common chains down the street. This restaurant (not sure which location) was also featured on Man v Food if that adds any incentive."}
{"text":"I am a food blogger and occasional restaurant reviewer and need to talk about the Primante Brothers in Moon Township, Pa. I visit Pittsburgh every August or September to see family.  I always stay within walking distance of this restaurant for convenience. I ate there three evenings the last week in August 2015.  I had anticipated the homemade spaghetti sauce (that reminds me of my childhood growing up in Ellwood City, Pa. with Italian neighbors) that I always order but they discontinued it.  I guess no one is ordering it and I don't know why.  It was great and I suffered a homemade spaghetti sauce withdrawal. 

Evening One:  Personal Pizza
Evening Two:  Traditional Gyro
Evening Three:  White Pizza

All good and margaritas are good too."}
{"text":"Primanti's is Pittsburgh in sandwich form. it embodies all that would help one get what it means to be in pittsburgh, through a bite of the sandwich. I'm not kidding. as most things you do in pittsburgh, it goes well with iron city beer or any beer at that. the sandwiches have fries, tomatoes and slaw on it. and its yummy. the chili cheese fries are just greasy yummy. 

straight off, i'm a bit of a food snob. but i respect food that has somehow been able to help you understand the city's history and the people. i would suggest having a primantis at the end of the night of going out, or right before you go and do some sight seeing of the city. this city has an amazing character and great history in the hard working men and women. and primantis is what these people eat. 

go steelers."}
{"text":"The story of 'Primanti Brothers' is really cool to me. Over 80 years ago, a couple of brothers own a sandwich cart (circa great depression), which leads to the opening of a brick and mortar diner in the strip district, and eventually expansion to +15 locations. Seems like a great recipe for success.

That being said, this is a place you come to see a little bit of Pittsburgh history and nostalgia, not for fantastic food. Prices are good and I enjoyed seeing the 'strip district' but other than that, I would take a pass on making a visit to Primanti Brothers."}
{"text":"Local icon.  Love it or be wrong.  Tell me how much better the original place is.  Who cares?  They're all fantastic.  As for value of food per money paid... you can't beat it.  It's a great place to go to have a beer, a sandwich, wings, pizza, etc.  It's also a great place to bring the kids.  They do it all well.  This location is very consistent with great quality & stellar service."}
{"text":"My review is going to sound like the several I read on here.  Spent two days in Pittsburgh and I told my hubby, \"I don't care what we do but we HAVE to go to Primanti Brothers before we go home!\"  Primanti Brothers is what i've associated with Pittsburgh and now that I've been there, for the life of me, I don't understand why.   
    First of all, no credit cards??  Your sales might sore if you accepted cards but then again, your food would have to match up to offering that feature.  
      We ordered Cheese steak.  Very little cheese.  It's a CHEESE steak.  Very little meat.  I couldn't even finish my half and not because it was too  big.  Hubby agrees with the comments on the food being bland.  I felt like I ordered a french fry sammy and everything else on the sandwhich were just condiments for the fries.   
Probably the worst chili cheese fries I've ever had.   
Ok, so I had my Pittsburgh experience and I walked out of the place thinking I'm was just being a food snob because nothing because Cincinnati food.   But now that I've read the reviews, i know its not just me."}
{"text":"All it took was three canceled flights and I found myself stuck in Pittsburgh for the weekend. A friend native to the city suggested I visit Primanti's so I ventured out to the Strip District location. Thankfully, I arrived right before the tourist/lunch rush. As a Cincinnati resident, I wasn't sure if I should love or hate the interior, specifically the scores of black & yellow. Pun intended. I know, I'm having a ball. 

I ordered the pastrami sandwich with fried egg and liked it. It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had, but I liked it. The most impressive part of my visit? Watching the cook remember all of the orders without writing anything down."}
{"text":"I never go to Primantis I just end up here around 2am because I'm hungry after a night out and what other way to eat a meal than on a sandwich? A Primanti sandwich isn't just a sandwich as it has all the fixings in between two slices of bread. I always opt to go for the turkey sandwich. At first I was weary about the fries on the sandwich but what real Pittsburgher wouldn't? There's no need to even get a side of fries because the side is on the sandwich. I give this three stars as it's not really my go to. Primantis is a Pittsburgh staple but if it was anywhere else it wouldn't work."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a Primanti sandwich?!?! Each time I head to Pittsburgh, the anticipation starts a craving then a need to get one. Luckily, I can usually talk my FIL in to going to get one with me.  This is what happens when you marry a girl from Pittsburgh.  You get sucked in to the incredible traditions...too bad I'm not a Steelers or Penguins fan...I'm a die-hard DC sports fan but am a HUGE fan of the food in Pittsburgh.  Where else can you get slaw and fries on a sandwich? Those that don't haven't lived.  Primanti's isn't known for their stellar service, but if you know what to expect going in, you will be lost and have judgments about the service.  I go for the food...not the service.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I definitely think that if you are traveling to Pittsburgh, you should stop by this regional favorite. The food is pretty delicious and quite unique. I only give it 4 stars because of what it was before. I remember when they would cut the sandwich and put it into bigger trays for you. 

Pros: good service, clean atmosphere, food is great tasting and delivered in a timely fashion, cheap, unique foods

Cons: the chicken wings were a little dry, the sandwichs are put on a plate that is too small for the sandwich

Overall: I always like going to Primanti's when I'm in town. A must go for anyone passing through."}
{"text":"I had a yearning for their hand-cut fries on this cold evening and my husband just wanted a quick bowl of chili. We didn't have time for one of the legendary sandwiches, and I like my fries plain. They have \"Primanti fries\" which are smothered with cheese and topped with bacon, but as I said, hand-cut fries with the skins on are perfect on their own. 

We had 15 minutes to spare and had to be in and out. Service is always fast and the order appeared in front of us in about 2 minutes. 

The mural, caricatures on the wall, tin ceiling, team logos, everything black and gold screams \"tourist trap\" and it is always recommended for first-time  visitors to Pittsburgh, but the prices, food and local clientele says otherwise. Doesn't disappoint. This IS Pittsburgh.

Love it!"}
{"text":"A sandwich is a sandwich. Had the steak and cheese. Food was good but the grease soaked through the bottom of the bread."}
{"text":"They did have Dogstyle Head Ale 60 Minute IPA, so good job there.  I got the \"Angus\" steak sandwich with double meat and the meat was a f-ing dogchew.  Jack Link's would have been a step up.  This is NOT a Philly cheesesteak, it is a Pittsburgh dogchew.  The fried pickles were actually very good.  The cheese sauce must be powder, it is not good.  I don't think they salt their fries either.  Sad, I keep wanting to like this place (3rd visit, 3rd location) because of the history but man that sandwich dogchew meat was bad.  The people here are friendly and very nice.  The service was good."}
{"text":"If we're in Pittsburgh, we gotta try Primanti Bros.! Their Corned Beef and Cheese sandwich is amazing. Fresh Italian bread with corned beef, provolone cheese, Primanti fresh-made fries, tomato, and coleslaw (more similar to sauerkraut). I got an additional egg on my sandwich and it really helps bind everything together. Having the sour element of the coleslaw helped cut through the collective thickness of the meat, fries, and bread."}
{"text":"I love this place because with everyone I talked to, they were like \"Oh yeah, you gotta go there!\" or \"No way, echhhh! It's not worth it at all!\"

Polarizing. That is the stuff I want. And I loved the sandwich; A heap of meat, covered with damn good fries and a dry, vinegary cole slaw inside soft, thick slices of bread. The formula is seen in other places around the country, and is even what brought about the hamburger itself: the working man wanted it all in a portable pouch that wouldn't get their hands too dirty. Come to Binghamton for spiedies or Jersey for a ripper, potatoes and peppers in a b read pocket. There are others around the country - all regional and either adored or misunderstood by locals. 

Yes, I would say this is a must-visit in Pittsburgh. And because there are so many around the city, you probably won't have to make a special visit to experience it."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: we had a bigger party than this place usually handles. So the cards were stacked against them. 

That being said, this place was NOT good. Firstly, the food had no flavor. That has nothing to do with our party size. I ordered the sardine & cheese, but in our party there were grilled chicken sandwiches, black bean burgers, & cheese steaks ordered. The sandwiches were big, especially for the price. But no flavoring, just overcooked, unseasoned meat with too many steak fries (in the sandwich) & weak cheese. The only seasoning available are salt, pepper, hot sauce, & ketchup. BIG disappointment. 

I'll cut them slack on the service because we were a big party, but they couldn't handle it well. Their stress was evident, & it took away from their service.

If it were me by myself or one other person, it would be 1 star. But the second start is pity for the party size"}
{"text":"So our friends from VA wanted to return to Primanti Brothers, which gave me an opportunity to try their pizza in personalized 4-cut form. 

Tomatoes, ham, and bacon filled my required quota of 3 toppings (as per the menu) for the pie, and I found its chunky sauce to be robust, its cheese to be akin to gossamer, and its balloon-edged cornmeal crust to be killingly crisp and chewy. Primanti's excels at their signature sandwiches as well as pizza. 

Chaperoning my pie was a salad dressed with a fantastic sweet/spicy clash of a honey dijon dressing, and speaking of salads, I finished massive Kay's Carribean Chopped Salad for her. Grateful for her full stomach, I eagerly ate up the remnants of it. Sweet corn kernels (!), cubed cucumber, roasted red peppers, smoked cheddar, a corned beef-ish bacon, and flatiron-grilled chicken breast cavorted on a UFO-wide plate underneath a terrific and tart mango dressing. 

Shared for dessert was their BIG Brownie Sundae. More like a pliable sheet cake than a brownie, it came topped with the usual hot fudge, vanilla ice cream, and a whipped cream that may or may not be Cool Whip (it looked to be piped on). Whether or not this is made from scratch in-house, I don't know, but I at least didn't mind eating it. 

Primanti Brothers may be going national, but the homogeneity usually associated with chain restaurants has yet to take hold. 

P.S. The funny, personable, entertaining, good-natured, and wonderfully \"nebby\" Michelle provided us with service that was nothing less than outstanding.

P.P.S. This location was previously the Lebanon Lodge and was known as Bimbo's (????) in the 60's and 70's. The building itself was erected sometime in the 1930's. Some of the old design features remain."}
{"text":"Somewhere, smack dab in the middle of last week, Kay and I experienced Primanti's; Kay for the first time, and I for the first time since the summer of 1994 when I worked at the long-dead Three Rivers Stadium location while on break from college. It was at that location where I lacerated two of my fingers while trying to open a can of cheese as a Bluto-like managerial figure bellowed at me. 14 stitches distributed between a duo of digits became my souvenir. So yes, the feared Primanti's sandwich and I have a history, and I bear scars from the ordeal to this day. I'll show 'em to yas sometime. 

While waiting in vain for an aborted concert to begin at an abortive venue, we came here to stifle our hunger pangs. How fitting it was for my next encounter, 17 years in the making, to occur at the original restaurant.

The Primanti's sandwich is contentious, cantankerous. Locals love it like a cousin who can't hold down a job or stay out of prison. Outsiders are often befuddled over it at best or are ruthlessly derisive of it at worst, even going so far as to use it as a vehicle to slander Pittsburgh and Pittsburgher alike. Defamers often view it as a microcosm of what they think is irredeemably wrong with our metropolis and its inhabitants. 

This primary satellite hides on a side street that is easy to miss along the main drag. As you walk down the dark alley, you may feel as if a killer is lying in wait, hunched over, ready to pounce. Oily as a cobra, weightier than a bull, angrier than a wolverine, a Primanti's sandwich is an agitated rat's nest of a meal in itself, and remains THE razor-wielding maniac of a bar food scene littered with the corpses of its challengers.

And I like mine with corned beef, egg, and provolone. 

There are gobs of imitators throughout the city, but this is the one true Primanti's; your choice of a slew of flat top-grilled meats, tomato, a tart, sauerkrautesque slaw consisting of nothing but cabbage, and a pile of rusty, hot fat-anointed fresh-cut \"potatoes\" all crushed between dense, dual cuts of Italian bread. 

The fries are supposed to be brown. The slaw is supposed to have a twang. The bread slices had better be thick. The meat must be cooked through. Anything else, as tasty as it might be, is a fake. 

Eating it is a backstreet brawl. Just when you think you've prevailed, it kips up, leaps at you, and keeps doing so until it just falls apart like one of Ray Harryhausen's animated skeletons only to come back to life! Paradoxically ramshackle yet indestructible, there's seemingly always more of it left to eat, and you want to eat it all so that you can say that you've conquered it or at least survived it. 

Its appeal lies partly in its convenience borne of blue-collar disenfranchisement. To us this is is a delicacy, a novelty, one of those things to try at least once when in town. Since they were only allowed brief breaks, to Depression-era workers, this was essential nourishment and helped to keep them moving while trying to earn a meager living; lunch all in one hand. The labor struggles of yesteryear created the conditions that let us enjoy this sandwich as a treat and nothing more, and as a working man, I am grateful for that. 

For the detractors, I pose these questions: Would it be more enjoyable (culinarily correct?) if the bread slices came from Pumpernickel and were cut into crustless triangles? What if the slaw was made of red cabbage, carrot shavings, and cilantro? Should brie, prosciutto, and heirloom tomatoes be used? Perhaps the potatoes should be sliced into medallions and sauteed in olive oil with garlic?  You'd like it more, especially if the alternative city paper critics did and if it was a NY thing. Don't lie.

Yes, and I will not stop saying this: There is far more to Pittsburgh dining than Primanti's. I was 19 years old before I had ever even heard of the thing, 20 before I ever bit into one (I got free sandwiches when I worked for 'em that summer) and went 17 years without having another. 

It's slapdash. It's supposed to be. It's taunting you while you're having a wild time attempting to consume it. It's The Sex Pistols, The Damned, and The Stooges wrapped in wax paper with no plate because no plate=punk as hell! If you can't handle it, get out of the moshpit! Order quick! Don't putzy arahnd! Do you know what you want? If you don't, come back later, they're gettin' slammed 'n 'at! It's madness! I know firsthand! I used to smell like cooking oil and bread because all I did was slice 'n fry! I'd like to think it built character, something Primanti's has in spades.

P.S. I found the service to be acceptably efficient. No, they're not rude, they're just very busy. There were only 2 people on duty! Once 2 barstools opened up, we sat down and even chatted with the gal running the grill along with a gent from Chicago. We were served fairly quickly, and the kid running the place appreciated my tip. You get in, order up, eat, and get out, 24/7."}
{"text":"Before I begin my account of last weekend's double date lunch at this Primanti's, I must first address some of the snarkier (obnoxious? rude? insincere? worthy of a boot to the head?) reviews.

#1-The place was not dirty. Those who say it was either came on a bad night or are attempting to libel a city through one of its institutions for whatever warped reasons they have floating around in their malformed brains. 

#2-The staff was not rude, socially backward, or any such thing. I had zero caveats about the service. Our waiter was attentive, clean-cut, spot-on, and unintrusive.  See #1 for the rest. My God, do you people hate our city that much? High school is over. You are no longer in 10th grade. Move on. 

#3-I had no problem with the paper cups. I don't know why one would not expect paper cups from an eatery such as this.

#4-We were given real silverware. 

#5-Who in the frack orders sparkling water at a Primanti's restaurant only to slag them for not having it?

Having ranted sufficiently, this very suburban Primanti's is for people who find the original Strip District locale to be a little too raw for their timid souls; the self-titled Metallica album vs. Kill 'Em All. This is a case of the Bob Rock figure coming to the Primanti's people and telling them they need to be a little more like Applebee's. 

Now having said all of THAT, I was shocked at the amount of choices this Primanti's offers and at how relatively tranquil it was. There were even video games! How's that for family friendly? 

This Primanti's has pizza, pierogi, 8 different salads, fried pickles, stuffed pretzels, jalapeno poppers, nachos, wings, a gyro, 5 Crostini sandwiches, Chicken Al Fredo (!), Sausage Al Forno (uhhh what?) a burger (I almost ordered one just to see how they do a burger but was thwarted by my companions), and (I'm not jaggin' ze wires) dessert! More on the sweets later. 

No, I would go Black like Venom and Angus like Mr. Young of AC/DC, eschewing the Italian and Kosher meats for the marinated supremacy of The Black Angus Sirloin Steak Sandwich. 

I picked up one half of it and noticed that the meat and cut french fries made it look as if it was an angry, sneering, overconfident mob boss with a mouthful of cigars being confronted by the Punisher towards the end of a long story arc. 

\"What? You wanna play hero, huh? You think yer gonna stop me ya do-gooder sonovabitch?\" My imagination had nearly come unglued. 

The heat from the sandwich burned my fingers, causing me to drop it. The egg I ordered on it spilled out as if it was a tongue, taunting me like many a rough trade sandwich. That's when I realized something: You can take a Primanti's off the street and into the suburbs, but you can't take the street OUT of a Primanti's sandwich! It is a rumbler no matter where it is made, and B.A.S.S.S is certainly one of the baddest bad-ass sandwiches ever prepared. 

One a hell of an alleyway brawl, the Italian bread damn near disintegrated, frustrating me. I flipped it over several times to gain leverage, but once I did and tasted THOSE fries mingling with THAT chilled, sauerkraut-ish cole slaw, and the most seared and searing steak ever, I was suddenly a laborer on a truck in Pittsburgh during the Great Depression, grime on my face, one hand on the steering wheel, the other hand holding an entire meal between two bread slices. There's a reason for the renown, even if not every one \"gets\" it because it's not expensive or gourmet or New York or L.A. enough for them. It is a serious sandwich, one that could put Au Bon Pain out of commission forever if it felt like it. This alone was more than enough...but wait! They have chili too?

Oh yes they do, and it's quite strong, not only in terms of quality but in terms of spice as well. *cough cough* Christ, it kicked like a mule, man, the cheese not cutting the heat a whole lot, the raw diced onion only aggravating matters. It's a soupy chili that has plenty of beans but isn't overrun with them for the purposes of being a filler, the amount of ground meat proving ample. Give this to me on a bitter winter day and watch me plow through 2 feet of snow afterwards. Primanti's chili is evidence that the chain has a bag of tricks apart from their famous sandwiches. 

Dessert was decent but quite obviously pre-fabricated. Kay's brother and his New York girlfriend (she LOVED the place by the way) ordered a brownie sundae that looked frozen then thawed via microwave magic (the ProTools of cooking), our pecan pie cut tasting like it. Is it that hard to bake your own pies and brownies? You've only got two desserts on your menu!

For that I deduct a star. The urbanite in me wanted to dock them another for the feeling that something unnameable is missing. Perhaps its the idea of having a Primanti's in Moon Township. Contrived? 

Accessible. Ah, that's the word. Hey, if it acts as a calling-card, so be it.

P.S. The NRA boycotted them. Bonus!"}
{"text":"West Mifflin (or is it Pleasant Hills?) has their own Primanti Brothers franchise. How 'bout that? Now one can grab a pastrami/corned beef monster sandwich before or after an ordeal at the Mart of Walls nearby.

Primanti Brothers sandwiches are often maligned, particularly when consumed at the original Strip District locale, but I will continue to vouch for the suburban satellites for they offer streamlined, more professional service, preparation, and atmosphere. Take your mother-in-law to this one and convert. 

But back to that sandwich on the Italian bread, the one with the slightly sweet sauerkraut-ish slaw, the french fried tater blades, the tomato, the onion...the bacon???

Hence the beauty of the suburban Primanti Brothers restaurants: the menus are more flexible and expansive. If you don't like the slaw, you can leave it off. Do you feel like a burger, pasta, pizza, or a gyro? This Primanti's has 'em, and will bring 'em to your table on that custom, bakery tissue-lined aluminum cookie pan that always evokes sheer comfort. 

And, unlike PB's grittier urban establisments, here one can indulge in dessert. In this case, we went with their...bread pudding? Hell yeah, you can have some of that here (brownie sundaes and pecan pie are also on the card)! Topped with a potent Maker's Mark whiskey sauce and raisins, this tart, spongy, honeyed, wholly housemade end to dinner brings to mind french toast or Bananas Foster sans bananas, if that reads sensibly.

I'm knocking off a star due to a slightly bitter aftertaste left by the slaw towards the last couple of bites. Was the cabbage cored before shredding? That faux pas aside, Primanti Brothers is a surefire way to make me smile on a wintery shopping trip, their sandwiches never failing to remind me why they are legend, clueless haters be damned."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch mid afternoon for the first time on a Sunday.  I ordered the New Yorker, hubby ordered the Ragin Cajun, and we ordered the Terror Tots.

What's hot
- Freshness.  Love love love the freshness of all the ingredients.  Saw the cook regularly slice fresh bread slices for all the sandwiches.  Never saw a frozen french fry.  In fact, I saw fresh cut french fries being poured outta buckets.  Their coleslaw and tomatoes are fresh, as well.  Our terror tots had fresh jalapeño slices.  Definitely adds a kick.
- Quality.  The flavor of my New Yorker sandwich was delish!  Could definitely taste the pastrami.  Even though there are fries in the sandwich, it's not overly salty, which is important.  Could definitely taste the stone ground deli mustard in my sandwich.  Additionally, the food isn't very greasy, which is a definite plus.
- Portions. You can hold your sandwich with one hand, but you better eat it with two!  Otherwise, your fillings fall out.  
- Prices.  It's about $10 per sandwich, so it's not cheap.  But you're getting good quality for your prices.

What's not
- Service.  We sat at the counter, right next to the grill, so our waiter was the cook.  None of the other staff checked in on us during our time there.  The cook is already hella busy and he wasn't getting much help for our orders.  Put it this way, we didn't get refills on our drinks and the cook had to bring up our check instead of one of the wait staff.  The other staff were doing their jobs, but everything looked haphazard.  It looks like they need a better system or more help.  
- Layout.  This place is hella busy.  Their Strip District location is open 24/7, which tells you something.  As a result, it's not always easy to find seating, especially at a table.  Their counter seats seem to be the most flexible.  If you're a party of 2, I recommend counter seats.  Anything more, good luck.

Final answer
Would definitely come back, but recommend finding as close to a down time as you can."}
{"text":"Want to gain 2 lbs just by eating a sandwich, here you go!
Stay skinny and good looking Pittsburg, or not!"}
{"text":"I came while on vacation in Pittsburgh and the sandwich I had was fantastic! I forget the exact one but it had pastrami! I'd love to come back the next time I visit."}
{"text":"There's a reason these are some the \"best sandwiches in America.\" Fresh ingredients is the name of the game here. You can watch your sandwich being assembled before your eyes and it's construction is a true art form, leading to explosive taste. Highly recommend the Capicola & Cheese (add bacon and egg), then top with the Red Devil hot sauce provided on the table for a true Primanti Bros experience!"}
{"text":"After all the hype and multiple people telling me i couldn't go to Pittsburgh without making a stop here, i decided i would try it out. The food itself is pretty good. You get a large amount for a super reasonable price. But the food wasn't what i had heard bad things about. The service was very subpar. We waited for someone to even come to the hostess stand for at least 6 or 7 minutes and after being directed to the bar we proceeded to sit down and order waters which we never received until we asked 2 other people for them. We ordered our sandwiches and waited and waited and watched 3 other people who sat at the bar and ordered after us get their food. We finally got the food and it was decent. But the fact that every single employee was stomping around clearly annoyed or mad about something and the lack of customer service made it clear that I'll never come back."}
{"text":"My favorite guilty pleasure. Love the egg bomb. Service always amazing and love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"I got a pizza since I have had the famous sandwich many times before at other locations. The pizza was made with fresh dough and had tons of cheese. The olives were a bit strong and salty, but it was pretty good. They also had WIFI and the staff was so nice to my 4 year old niece and my 2 year old son. I'd actually give them 3.5 stars. Bathroom was super clean."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance went here late one night and split a famous Primanti Bros cheesesteak sandwich. Just like they say, it's packed with way too much coleslaw (little or no mayo, but still good), french fries and soft italian bread. Definitely over the top. But good nonetheless."}
{"text":"As someone who has visited Pittsburgh but not a fan of the city I must say I enjoyed the place. I took my daughter there while staying in the area. I have to say that people up here thing anything \"that is Pittsburgh\" is good. I can tell you that is not the case 90% of the time. The restaurant has a local family type place feel that you could also enjoy a beer and watch a game. I hate Pittsburgh sports so I can not take points away since I know this is in Pittsburgh and it covered in the stuff. I got the Corned Beef and it was well cooked and just enough of the other toppings.  The kids menu is pretty expansive and had about 8 different things for a child to choose. You get used to having about 4 to 5 normally. Overall I must say I would enjoy and go back."}
{"text":"I just moved from San Francisco to here and we have a very similiar restuarant. Nothing is better than the Pittsburgh's version- hot capicolas all the way. Sinced being here beginning of January, I've had it literally 6+ times and stopped counting. Love the fried pickles as well!!"}
{"text":"I really want to give them 5 stars as I grew up on the sandwiches but I think they have let the fame go to their head. I can understand all the low reviews becuase the food channels have over hyped this place beyond all reason. Realistically it's a good cheap and local place to grab a big sandwich and wash it down with an ice cold \"America's Oldest Brews\" (Yuengling). It really is a GOOD sandwich though but I feel it was better before all the hype. Also if it's your first time order some smallman st. fries as well. This is the only Pirmanti's I will go to and I love the fact it is 24/7."}
{"text":"We celebrated my moms 60th birthday here with family and the management was a pleasure to work with. They did their best to offer us a private area and were so accommodating. The service was great and the food is always consistently good. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and friendly staff.  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  Definitely get your taste buds ready for some awesomeness!!"}
{"text":"While the food is not too great here, the company does business with a crooked valet service"}
{"text":"I've been to this pb before and have had really good experiences but I have never written a review.   I usually done at the original in the strip weekly but occasionally I find myself at the Harmar location.   This review is about my most recent visit.   I planned on writing a review regardless if it was good or bad....tonight is somewhere in between.    Came in a little late off pa28 heading to airport.  Arrived about 930.   Got a table outside right away.   Food was friendly but really really.    R.   E.  A. L.  L. Y. Slow.  We waited for almost 25 min to get a check.   No check backs from the time we got food to really the time we left.  We had to have someone down each time.  It was Not busy.   No server.    Where'd she go?   Hmmm.   Men's room urinals walls and floors had so much urine built up on it that it looked like someone was cracking eggs in there.  I've made deliveries to farms that smelled better too.   Along the way I scoped out the server station. Really bad.  Maybe they were really slammed right before we got there but who knows...Hey, Anyone reading his seen my server?   Look.  Like I said.  This may be one of those times you just get the short straw and have a bad experience but I would come back and give them another shot.   This place is usually pretty decent.  But you can definitely tell there are issues with training and management tonight.  Lots of employees standing around and everything is a disaster.  Zero server attentiveness.   Atmosphere great.    I'd recommend it with an asterisk.    This experience was terrible."}
{"text":"Ok, another update.  We occasionally come to this location and the service is always excellent.  We actually come on Mother's Day (not our traditional Mom's Day place but fun) in the evening and had a short wait for a table but it was less time then quoted, which was a plus.  Our waitress was so good and on top of everything.  She even stepped away as our kids gave their Mom a card and present.  
The food was good and is the standard Primanti's which we enjoy but I do realize not everyone wants fries on there sandwich.  We started with some wings that were good and piping hot.  I had PB Rueben, that was really enjoyable and not to many calories, lol.  All in all, a fun place to celebrate."}
{"text":"It was alright. We had so many people from Pittsburgh recommend this place- everyone we asked about one thing we can't miss went on and on about trying Primanti's. It wasn't horrible but I'm sure the street vendor down the block selling fried rice was better. I didn't understand all the hype."}
{"text":"The main reason you go is for the experience, to experience the place and the fun sandwich.  

Went before the Pirate game a couple of days ago.  Place was not crowded and had quick and Ok service, which can be a change depending on the mood of the staff.  

Having been to Primati's many times have learned to get some of the meats that have a little bit of zip/taste so ordered the capicolla, and the sandwich came out hot and the capicolla was very good.  The slaw had a tart taste and went well with the sandwich, my only grip is the fries, why are they so eh and so soft and mushy.  Yes the Italian bread was good and yes the sandwich got a little soggy and the bread started to get little hard to handle and break apart. But that is all part of a Fun Experience of Primanti's."}
{"text":"During my weekend trip to Pittsburgh, I knew there was one place I had to try other than Meat & Potatoes. Primanti Brother's is a hometown classic that some may call a tourist trap, but for many it's the place to go after a late night of drinking.

Joe Primanti sold sandwiches in the Strip District during the Great Depression to hungry truckers looking for a filling, yet affordable meal. With sandwiches filled with fries, it's no surprise they became popular. Primanti Brothers changed hands a few times since, but current owner Jim Patrinos has been continuing the tradition for the past 40+ years.

Spicy Pub Pickles [$5.29]

I started with the spicy pub pickles, which were crisply battered and had the faintest hint of spice. These briny hits of goodness were accompanied by a pat of ranch dressing.

The Pitts-burgher [$6.89] + Fried Egg [$0.50]

Sadly, I was disappointed with what was designated as the #2 best sandwich here (read: it's a Primanti Brothers joke). I loved the bread, which was fresh, soft, and housed a huge mound of fries and slaw. The fries could have benefited from a crisper fry to provide some texture to each bite, but the tangy slaw really made each bite. And who can complain about the fried egg I added? But the steak was a sad sausage-like patty. If this was fresh-sliced steak grilled a la Philly style, this sandwich could have been money. But the consistency of the \"meat\" was sad to say the least. Next time I'll need to try some of the other sandwiches because unfortunately I was not having it with the meat on the Pittsburgher."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich for a great price. This place is a must stop for anyone new to PA or Steelers fans."}
{"text":"I LOVE Primanti Bros. Every thing on the menu is cooked to perfection and of coarse the fries help make the meal even better the salty crunchy fries add a nice touch on you sandwich too!"}
{"text":"I loved the pastrami here. There was a women who served me and she was so nice to me especially when I told her I was visiting from NY. The sandwich was so big that I didn't even need to order fries but I still packed everything down lol. I wish there was a location in NY or CT."}
{"text":"While living in Pittsburgh, I ate at many Primanti's, but this was my neighborhood location. Wife and I used to go there to watch games, or just hang out at the bar. Super awesome staff, hella cheap beer, great food....just wish they'd ban smoking inside."}
{"text":"A legendary Pittsburgh hot spot. Picture this.  A sandwich with tomatoes, fries, coleslaw and your favorite choice of meat. Choose from ham, turkey, roast beef, chicken or from one of the countless sandwich choices on the menu. My favorite is the steak and cheese. This is definitely a spot to hit up when you're in the 'burgh, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5, amanda the server was so fun on both trips. Food is ok, pizza was good, the mystery meat with fries and slaw was ok."}
{"text":"Boring sandwich. Period. I fell for the \"hype\" and while it was filling for $7 bucks, it just did not satisfy a craving...I had the corned beef."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches but wish there was a sauce on them.  Our waiter was amazing.  The boneless wings were very small but did have good flavor.  If you buy them on happy hour, then they are worth the price."}
{"text":"An over-sized, over-stuffed, freshly made-to-order sandwich with whatever meat you want in it, complete with fries and slaw (and optional egg!)... how can you go wrong? I usually end up just using a fork to eat the sandwich, but it's still good otherwise."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I have ever had! The seats on the corner of the bar were awesome!!! Guest review by BBB, and I agree!"}
{"text":"Weekly stop for me. I'm new to Pittsburgh and love a big sandwich.
The chili is really good."}
{"text":"On my last trip to Pittsburgh, I saw Primanti and thought this is a must try. It's a local institution with awesome sandwiches and pop, right?  On this trip, I was able to fit it in - it was an experience that I don't need to experience again.   I hadn't looked at the reviews so I didn't realize that it was so limiting - essentially a meat and cheese on gigantic white bread with vinegar based coleslaw and fries.
I asked the server for a recommmendation and went with the pastrami and cheese - it was fine - a huge sandwhich and I was super hungry and was able to eat most of it but it's just not my thing.
Kudos to Primanti for knowing how to provide a big sandwich with just the right balance of toppings.  Only the coleslaw overflowed.
They go light on the cheese but it's a good thing.  You will be full after eating here and probably will not want to eat anything or look at food for a long while.

Vegetarians and people on gluten free diets should stay away in my opinion - the options would be very very limiting."}
{"text":"It was like a right of passage for me....a personnel mission. To sit in Primanti Bros, in Pittsburgh and having the Pittsburger! I came and it was everything I dreamed it would be lol. Simple: Get there, order it, be happy my friends!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are not that great.. .Fries inside the sandwich are soggy and the coleslaw is flavorless... Very overrated!"}
{"text":"Can't go to Pittsburgh and not try one of their sandwiches! A bit overrated in my option though... Sandwiches are huge, but the fries they stuff the sandwiches with are very dry and soggy, and not crispy at all! This is definitely one of those restaurants you go to, just to say you have!"}
{"text":"I have grown up in Pittsburgh, and no matter where I travel in the world, this is my favorite place. I have been an avid, loyal, and devoted customer to my fav place. Cheesesteak rules.  I have brought friends here and anyone from out of town can find something on their menu to eat.  Every city has their niche - and this one is truly, uniquely Pittsburgh. Long live Primantis."}
{"text":"Usually 5 stars...sometimes the bartenders are overworked and completely ignore you when trying to place an order for a drink while you wait.  

All that said - great food and waiter was awesome. We make it a point to stop at a Primanti Bros when in Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Greates restaurant of all time there is a reason why this restaurant is featured on food Channel all the time. If you come you must order a Pittsburger and a iron city beer."}
{"text":"Everywhere I searched about where to eat in Pittsburgh, Primanti Bros. was always mentioned. We went on a weekday and it was packed but we were seated promptly. I really like the sports feel to the place and that I can enjoy my lunch while catching up with the latest news. Since I was visiting Pittsburgh I found it only fair to order the Pittsburger with a double patty!! I shared it because it was huge. We couldn't stay too long because we had a flight to catch but this is the type of place that we would've stayed to enjoy some beers and football talk."}
{"text":"I had the capicola and cheese sandwich topped with fries, slaw and tomatoes. The sandwich is different and great at the same time. The different ingredients combine to create a unique flavorful explosion in your mouth. I always come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, we had to check this place out. I ignored the mediocre reviews and paid the price. The food was average at best. The two guys working couldn't care less if we there or not. Cash only! I noticed throughout Pittsburgh many \"cash only\" establishments. I understand avoiding taxes, but these places are also avoiding a lot if potential business. There are many better restaurants, believe the other reviewers that this dive is not special."}
{"text":"What?  This place was insane today!  Slinging the food like nobody's business!  So fun to watch and so busy today!  Only regret was sharing a sandwich with my dining partner and getting the small half!  Deliciously decadent, if not obscene."}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh Primati Bros. is the place too eat for sure.
It is so nice as a New Yorker when you are out of state and you see what real friendly service actually is.
Wife and I got to Primate's and were seated immediately.
The place is laid out nice and the tables are large, We got a nice large table upstairs with a view of the whole restaurant.
The service was totally freakin super amazing,
I had the roast beef with provolone and a corona to wash it down.
The waiter was super super super friendly and was probably among the best service I have ever had in any restaurant anywhere.
The sandwich was delicious and among the best roast beef I have eaten.
I would highly recommend Primate Brothers to anyone visiting Pittsburg it is definitely a must goto."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd Primate Bros. I have been to in the last few weeks.
This time my wife and I ordered to go as we were in a rush and had to head home.
I had a angus sirloin sandwich with the coleslaw on the side.
The sandwich was good and the service was ecellent.
I think the prices are a bit high but the service and food is good.
I am not a huge fan but would probably go again in the future."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are legen, wait for it dary. All you have to do is ask a local and they will tell this is like a diner in New Jersey. No frills, no BS, just darn good food with Iron City beer or IC Lights. Don't go in here, thinking it's all about the service, or linen tablecloths. It's sandwiches and local beer in the OG Strip District. If you want a real treat, go when the bars close and stumble into this bad boy, just don't forget what you want to order, because you will get \"stoned, caned or water boarded\". LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is INCREDIBLY immature and EXTREMELY INATTENTIVE (we sat at the bar). Having to ask for a beer from Marissa after she picked up my empty and walked away was the first flag. Watching another of the 9 people behind the bar pour wine into a dirty glass (then wiping it with his towel hanging off his backside) was enough to make me wish I hadn't already eaten food here. Capacolla was terrible...generic \"spiced ham\". There is another location (I believe the original) that is AWESOME. If your downtown, don't waste your time at this place in Market Square.  You would be FAR better off at \"Sammy's New York Style famous corned beef\". Much better mature and laid back staff.  Not to mention a deal on Southern Tier 2X IPA... $4.25 @ Sammy's,  but $6.50 @ Primates."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple. I had to go, well, I was highly suggested to go. This was a perfect meal for a Saturday night. Not too greasy, filling and cheap. I've written in another review that Pittsburgh has great bread and Primanti Brothers falls into that category. 

The soft Italian bread envelopes a tasty sandwich of your choice. I opted for the cheese steak, but I should've gone with turkey. (next time!) Each Primanti Brothers sandwich comes with coleslaw and french fries on it. Yes, in the sandwich. Since I was in the PIttsburgh staple, I went with my friends suggestions and had an Iron City brew too. 
Uh, perfect."}
{"text":"This location is ok, only plus for me tends to be that it is out of the way from everything. Though it is almost always packed and parking can be very tricky when it is packed.

It's your typical Primanti experience, with the typical Primanti fare. 

I have never had a problem with service, and actually usually have a great waitress that is usually attentive (or as attentive as you can be in a busy restaurant).

My favorites to get though are the Pastrami and cheese, the Capi and Cheese (sometimes i get crazy and put an egg on top of it), and the Pitts-burger. What I love about the sandwich(s) though is that tangy slaw. Literally tastes good on everything. I tend to enjoy the wings as well. Enough to usually share with someone else and still have room to eat half of my sandwich.

I have ordered online before and it was generally an ok experience. The place was packed so I had to wait a little while but I have no problem doing that."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are good, but not my favorite. Fries and cole slaw on my sandwich just aren't my style. Always dirty in the store, I don't mind brushing a few crumbs off the table but darn it, clean up a little."}
{"text":"Once again, Primanti's delivers...delicious food at great prices. 

Just know what you want because they're always busy, and they look at you funny if you try to order something special. 

Me, I like the fries on the side, and I like the sandwich grilled, but if I'm the last to order--which I usually am--I have to spit it all out at once and hope that I don't sound like Meg Ryan ordering a sandwich. 

I highly recommend the pastrami. It's always lean and tender."}
{"text":"Fun and friendly, great prices, yummy food, and a great happy hour...what more could you want?

Third trip here, and it's definitely  going on my list of favorite haunts when I move here."}
{"text":"I have heard about Primanti Bros, from many sources, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I've had better food. I was glad that i tried the place, and I would may possibly go back there, but I was expecting the sandwich to be a little better. I got mine with pastrami on it, and I'm not a huge cole slaw fan, so maybe that's why i didn't like the sandwich as much. There was a little bit too much fries and coleslaw on it for me. The bread was outstanding though! I would still recommend going there for the experience!"}
{"text":"After all the hype, the sandwich was made with old fries that tasted as if the oil they were fried in had not been changed in months. Add spoiled Cole slaw and nothing tastes good. 

I definitely appreciate the college town feel of the place, however the food is awful. Everyone talks about it being an experience, and it actually is an experience, one you do not need to try. 

Stay away, not good !"}
{"text":"A friend found out we were going to Pittsburgh and told us that we HAD to go to the original Primanti location. He raved on and on and used words like 'amazing' and let us know that it would be the best decision we made all weekend. Yup, I was majorly disappointed.

I don't know if it's just me, but if I'm going to a sandwich shop, I expect some stellar or special bread. Due to the massive amounts of cole slaw on the sandwich, my bread was soggy and limp. Bummer. A guy at another table sat down right after us and I overheard him order his sandwich without the cole slaw. At first, I thought this guy was a novice, but after I ate it I understood why -- damnit. (Side note, I didn't even really like the taste of the cole slaw and I picked most of it off.)

I did however enjoy the french fries on my Pittsburgh cheese steak sandwich (the #2 most ordered sandwich. Never did figure out what #1 was) and had it just been fries and the patty, I would have probably loved it a lot more and given 4 stars. But me no like soggy bread :(

Adam Richman ate here and I have a huge crush on him, so I am happy to report that I ate in the same place as him but that's as far as my excitement over Primanti goes.

Also, after dining here I realized I have a really small mouth. I couldn't even get the massive sandwich in my mouth."}
{"text":"Really, really wanted to give this place a 5, but the wait was just to long. Now granted I can't fault a place for being busy, but the whole time we were there, there was always a line of about 5 people or more out the door, and they literally had a packed house with 3 people working, total, including the cook.

Now granted, the food was OUTSTANDING as we predicted. My girlfriend saw this place on the Food Network, and I grew up in and around \"The Burgh\", so this wasn't my first time here, but I hadn't been in about 5 years after moving to California.

We were not disappointed taste wise, as everyone knows about this place. But again, I really wanted to put a 5, but with the wait, which for us was literally 20 minutes, an extremely solid 4 is the best I can do."}
{"text":"This is a Pittsburgh staple, so on our trip here a few months ago, my friend as I wanted to visit the original location. We were not disappointed! I love this place because it reminds me of a greasy-spoon type local joint. A place to watch the game, a place to meet up with friends before or after the bar, a place that I would love to go to on a casual date and a place I could bring my parents. Be warned, though, this is not a place to watch your calories!"}
{"text":"The legend of Primanti Bros. and their original cart in the Strip District in the 1930's has been well documented - featured on no less than 5 Food Network programs the history of Joe Primanti and his hefty sandwiches loaded with fresh cut fries, sweet slaw, and plenty of toppings is perhaps the most legendary in the Pittsburgh dining scene.  Driving up from Columbus early on a Monday morning we decided to kick off our trip with the legendary (albeit revised) original location - a small bar on 18th Street, at the heart of the Strip District.  Arriving at 9am we arrived between breakfast and lunch and found easy free parking before making our way into the heavily wooded and entirely homey feeling bar.

Finding the location surprisingly empty (we were the only patrons) I was a bit put off as the two older ladies behind the register eyed us without saying a word.  Making our way further into the restaurant and chuckling at the legendary Pittsburgh caricatures lining the walls I rather guessed that the 24-hour nature of Primanti Brothers had left us with employees at the beginning or end of a shift as it actually required a concerted effort to place an order.  Not wanting to get filled up as we had a whole day of eating and museum hopping ahead of us we opted for a single sandwich and two \"pops\" to which our cashier stated \"is that it?\" almost incredulously.

Undeterred we sat down and waited while our sandwich was prepped, dressed, and brought to the table on white paper.  By the time our sandwich had arrived another couple groups had entered the restaurant and our server's mood began to soften - a little.  Presented with a smile our Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich was quite good.  Thick yet yielding the white bread provided a great transport medium that stood up well to the sweet and savory slaw, crispy golden fries, salty bacon, creamy egg, and (honestly) somewhat underwhelming cheese.  Divided amongst the three of us the sandwich was enough to get a taste of what the restaurant was all about and enough for me to say the food largely makes  up for the service.  Much like many \"legendary\" restaurants (Tony Packo's, Central Grocery, etc) the food at Primanti's isn't going to blow your mind - but the setting, style, and experience are definitely something to witness when you're visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Parking lot for Primanti Bros. customers, 
centralized location, downtown in the strip district,
hospitable staff and very homey feel,
fast and efficient service,
good pastrami on soft Italian bread stuffed with french fries and coleslaw!!!!
ya,
its kinda like that.
black and yellow black and yellow!"}
{"text":"We always go to the original primantis location in The Strip but decided to try the Southside location today. We won't be coming here again,first I've ordered our drinks 3 times! First we had dirt or dust in our drinks,then got something that tastes like carbonated water,third time we just went with something else. The waitress looks like she crawled out of bed 10 minutes ago and keeps playing with her hair! All the garbage cans are overflowing and the floors are filthy....I have a feeling the food isint gonna be up to Primanti standards either."}
{"text":"Terrible sandwich. I don't care if it's a Pgh staple-- it's gross."}
{"text":"A good sandwich spot for lunch if you want to eat something unique in Pittsburgh. Primanti Sandwiches have been around forever and they're essentially Meat, Coleslaw and French Fries between 2 slides of bread. 

It's filling and delicious, but I wouldn't say I would eat this every week. Every once in a while when I get a craving.

Service is always friendly and prices are pretty affordable. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Was in town on a baseball stadium tour and heard about this place from the locals.I enjoyed my sandwiches and was hooked with the special slaw added to the sandwiches.I was also in luck once we caught the pirates game I noticed they had primantis in the park so I ordered another sandwich."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great food. Lots of it and tasty. Had the Pitts Burger and was awesome. Enjoyed the friendliness of the staff and how quickly I was served. Definitely will come back here."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Terribly overrated.

Had the pastrami and cheese.  Sloppily built, scrimped on meat, bread had Wonder Bread texture."}
{"text":"The Primanti Bros sandwich is one of those things you just have to do when you are in this area.  Great French bread, your choice of grilled meat, fresh cut fries, and a vinegar slaw piled high and served on waxed paper, without a plate.  The sandwich is a little light on meat, but the piles of fries and slaw really make for a beautiful pile of awesome.

The corner location with unfinished interior makes for a cool neighborhood feel, but the service (staff in general) is curt to the point of being a little rude.  Beers are all mainstream...some local taps would be nice.  

Bottom line: this location has a cool old-city vibe and the food is great."}
{"text":"Pittsburgher Cheesesteak, the number 2 best seller one would think  would be amazing....
This was a place my husband found and thought since it is a Pittsburgh institution with locations all over the city it must be good.
Coming in to the bar area they sent us to the back right away since the bar is smoking and not for kids.
The back not so nice.
I was over it and the man got the cheesesteak for $9 and if you see the picture once he unwrapped it was like WTF?
Not very large or innovative, the steak a burger like patty, sure it had fries, cheese and coleslaw (my fav part of the sandwich, tasted more sauerkraut like) but overall just not as stellar as hoped.
Service is fast, atmosphere kind of dingy, not really worth the stop or the money."}
{"text":"Long lines on game days, so expect a line out the door, if so. Don't be discouraged, they seat quickly! If you sit at the bar, you can see them flip Cappicola and other items around the kitchen. There are enough TVs to see sports from anywhere in the restaurant. Most sandwiches have their traditional slaw and fries so be prepared to eat...or share! Try their battered pickles as well."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the most anticipated sandwiches of my life. After seeing this place on Man v Food, I was determined to come here. Well on a business trip to Pittsburgh, I lightning bolted over to this place as soon as I got off the plane.

Point blank, this sandwich IS worth all the hype. As excited as I was, I was slightly skeptical about how fries and slaw would mix with some of the sandwiches. So I ordered the Pastrami sandwich which comes with the aforementioned on top... It was straight up unbelievable. Surprisingly, everything mixed perfectly together and the bread even stood out as being very good. 

If you're a health conscience, then it makes absolutely no sense to come here at all. You're here for the most unhealthy and delicious sandwich you'll ever have, so keep that in mind. That being said, this is place is delicious and it's an absolute must when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Good prices and a Pittsburgh Classic. Kolbassi sandwich with Fries? Yum. Spicy rub pickles? Yum. Good beer, too. Nice outside seating but beware the pigeons, sit-down and counter service,"}
{"text":"Local dining icons deserve their own criteria for recognition.  That said, adding sliced tomato, coleslaw and a pile of fries to a deli sandwich defines the Primanti as a Pittsburgh-area institution.  Their cheesesteaks will never threaten the best of Philly's, nor will their pastrami or corned beef be mistaken for New York deli; this only serves to make the Primanti style unique.  I find their meats to be generally good, and reasonably generous.  Tomato on a corned beef sandwich can only be regarded as an acquired taste.  Personally, I'm not a fan of loading a sandwich with fries, but again, this is a matter of preference.  The assembled work is a massive sandwich which invites a machismo-driven, face-first dive into its mismatched imperfection.  After the second or third surfacing-for-air, the conclusion I've always had was of an enjoyable adventure.  Prices are downright cheap."}
{"text":"Ive got to think I shed at least a few years off my life with this sandwich!

I was told when in Pittsburgh, you have to have a Primanti Brothers sammy...so I did. It was good. I'm not sure it was great, but I don't require eggs and french fries on my sandwich. 

I think the fact that since it's the thing to eat it  slightly better."}
{"text":"I wanted a Philly Cheesesteak and he recommended the sirloin sandwich. I thought it was nice and tasty - but I'm not a local and was kind of surprised the fries went into the sandwich. At first it was a fun novelty, but later the fries become soggier and soggier and I had to start pulling them out of the sandwich. Kind of moot if you put fries in so the customer has to take them out. Not my thing. 

Beers were super cheap, but for some reason, tasted a little funky to me that day. Can't really complain though. All in all, a decent experience, nothing that good or that bad. I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh for a couple days for an interview and wanted some authentic Pittsburgh food. After a quick Google search I found out this place was right near my hotel. What a filling sandwich that was! Delicious too! Some of the best fries I've had in a while too!"}
{"text":"Only been there once and would not return.

Server wasn't great, but wasn't bad either.

We had the pastrami and cheese sandwich. Between the bread, coleslaw, fries, cheese, and pastrami the  only bit of taste came from the little bit of meat. As a side we had the cheese fries. Make some fries and microwave some cheesewhiz and you could make them much better at home."}
{"text":"Had to make a special stop on my road trip to DC here. Love their sandwiches, my top  2 are the corn beef and the Sirloin steak (my#1 favorite, the vinegar of the slaw goes perfect with the steak and fries). I wish i could of stayed long enough to have wings and beer. Big menu with something for everybody. Oh and if you can't handle the sight of the Steelers, don't even bother coming here, because it is all decked out in Steelers garb. Oh and they also have really good cheese fries here."}
{"text":"Its good for you to know that though the location (strip street) is in a bustling neighbourhood, there is free parking at the back for Primati customers! we parked elsewhere not knowing, and paid a tenner for 1 hour. 
So anyways, we came in around 4pm on a saturday afternoon and though it was full, there was no line. We were seated almost immediately. The menu says \"pittsburger cheesesteak\": is the second best.  Dont ask them whats #1 since they will always say \"what you order is\". Okay! that doesnot help!
So we ordered the colossal fish, pastrami, double egg & cheesesteak. 
HUGE portion sizes. I could barely finish one half of the s/w. LOVED the pastrami. The others were just okay. Infact I didnt like the cheesesteak much. Yumm fries, but they get mushy sandwiched with the coleslaw. 
The coleslaw has no mayo - its vinegar based, but delish!

We ended up going there twice (Pittsburgh downtown restaurants are strangely closed on sunday mornings), I dont think I will go back though."}
{"text":"I don't think that this place is my cup of tea, but based on the line out the door and down the sidewalk; there are certainly a lot of people with the opposite opinion.

Primanti Brothers is obviously an institution in Pittsburg, and I had heard of it many times before I ever got the chance to visit. This location in the Strip District puts it right in the middle of an area with tons of shops and places to visit either before or after your meal, and has a lot of options for paid parking. I thought we had done well in avoiding the lunch crowd by arriving around 1:30 on a Friday, but like I said, the line out the door proved that wrong. The line went pretty quickly, as it is a fast meal for a sit down place. Before you go stand in that line, know that this is a cash only place so be prepared ahead of time.

The menu is pretty simple. Basically just pick your meat from a very long list of options, and they will put that on white bread and pile it with some cheese, french fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes. Onions are an optional extra, and you can get an extra order of fries on the side if the ones on your sandwich aren't enough. The loaded fries actually look pretty delicious, and since this is a 24 hour place I can imagine that those become pretty popular later in the evening. We got our drink and food orders in quickly with the waitress shortly after we got seated. The staff was more of a no-bullshit, get you in and out with everything you need quickly, type of staff. They reminded me of what you'd find in a New Jersey diner, in that they aren't going for over the top friendly service, but you'll get everything you order and you'll get it quickly. 

The sandwiches all came out on pieces of wax paper shortly after we put our order in. There are no plates, and they just set them down in front of you on the table, but the overly sized paper squares that they are served on is helpful to keep the fillings that fall out of the sandwich contained and not all over the place. The sandwiches are massive, and will easily leave you full. At under $7 a piece, it's a lot of food for the price. Unfortunately, the sandwich to me just tasted like I was eating a french fry and coleslaw sandwich. It's too big to get a bite of everything, and the smaller portion of meat is easily masked by the giant stack of fries and big scoop of coleslaw even if you could get a representative sample of everything. The white bread is nice and thick and does a good job of keeping the sandwich contents contained. I got pastrami, which is usually a pretty flavorful meat, but it was definitely playing well behind the fries and coleslaw when it came to flavors, due entirely to portion sizes. They have the options to pay extra to get double meat, and I think that I will definitely do that if I find myself here again. I ended up putting hot sauce or ketchup on the last bites of my sandwich to mix up the flavors since it was just too much of the same thing.

All in all, they provide what they try to provide. It's a good sized sandwich at a reasonable price. The place definitely has a nostalgic feeling to it, and doesn't appear to have changed much in a while. It's a great fit for the strip district. They have a unique offering that helps set themselves apart from the rest of the crowd, but I personally think that that is their biggest downfall. The sandwich itself just isn't that good based on the amount of each thing they put on it. 

Additionally, if you're looking for something to wash down the food with, they have a full bar inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"What do you mean Santa Claus isn't real?  

Mommy?  

Daddy?!

That's kind of the feeling I have now about the Food Network.  

Not every restaurant they rave about on TV is amazing??  

Mommy?  

Mistake #1:  I made and ass out of umed.  
I figured the \"Cheese Steak\" sandwich was just a cool shortened title for the almighty Philly.  I thought it was odd how I said, \"I'll have the Philly\" and the bartender said, \"The Cheese Steak?\"  and actually waited for me to confirm.  
My friend and I both got the Cheese Steak sandwich.  The price was right and you'd think if it's the \"#2 best seller\" you can't go wrong.  Therein lies...

Mistake #2:  Bestsellers are not always the best tasting.  
Or maybe the gap between #1 and #2 is just really big.  After the first few bites, I felt like an idiot.  The only thing in the sandwich that had any real flavor was the cole slaw, and even that was so-so.  The meat was a flavorless beef patty, and the texture was disappointing.  Like microwaved leftovers.  I had to drowned the thing in hot sauce to finish it.  I love the concept, I really wanted to like my food.  In fact, I acted like I was enjoying it.  It wasn't until later that day that I expressed my disappointment to my friend.  He was quick to agree.  It sat heavy in my stomach for the rest of the day.  And not in a good way.

We had one day in Pittsburgh.  I did see other great looking eats on Yelp, but we played it safe.  I don't regret it.  And if I had a few weeks there, I'd probably give 'em a second chance.  Maybe someday."}
{"text":"My husband and I had never been to Primanti Brothers before.  We met some of his family there over Thanksgiving week-end.   We had a wait, but it was worth it.   They will not serve a party until all members of the party are there which is fair.  They can't hold tables because it's so busy.   I didn't realize how huge the sandwiches are.  I got Kielbasa and cheese.   For those of you who have never been there, they put the cole slaw and Fries right on the sandwich.  It's huge.  I had to take half of mine home.  The food is very good and the atmosphere is fun.   They may take reservations, but I'm not sure about that."}
{"text":"So good. Really nice people, hard working staff (like off the hook hard-working). Crazy cheap food and really tasty too. Every time I'm in Pittsburgh I try to make it here at least once. I've been to the downtown location after a Pirates game it and was a blast and also the original location by The Strip is a great lunchtime and dinner time thing during the weekends. Lines can be long at both but nothing but love for this very real establishment."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing it on the Food channel. The pastrami sandwich was bland and it was difficult to eat with the soggy fries and unseasoned cole slaw. Overall, I would definitely not return."}
{"text":"I've been a Primanti's fan for years so I decided to try out the new location in Hampton.   It's the worst Primanti's I've been to so far.   I've enjoyed all of the other locations more than this one.

To be fair and give the Hampton location a fair try, I've eaten there four times so far.   Each time it has been way too busy (packed with people) and the food takes FOREVER to be served.   At our last visit, we waited over a half hour for our salad, wings, and sandwiches.   The server didn't have the sense to even bring out the salad before the rest of the food.   

It's always way too noisy.

They have a windowed enclosure on the one side of the building and it's too cold in the winter.  

The food was good there a couple of times and a couple of times the food was crappy.    It's a gamble."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many a Primanti Brothers. This store in the Waterfront is now my favorite. Downloaded their app received a free sandwich last week. Because we ate there last week and scanned the receipt using the app, we were eligible for a free fish sandwich on Friday only during Lent. This is not why it's my favorite place. 
 We ate there on a Saturday during lunch. The service was super fast and attentive. So going on a Friday night during the dinner rush we were lucky to get one of the last tables. Ordered a drink from the bar and both had the fish. Let me say the food nearly beat the drink to the table!  The fish sandwich was every bit as good if not better than any local fish fry. 
 So all that being said, if you are from out of town, I suggest you try a Pittsburgh favorite. Try any of the many sandwiches with coleslaw, fries and choice of meat on thick Italian bread and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was told this was a must stop while in Pittsburg. Ordered the burger, tater tots and chili. Chili was more like a tomato soup with beef and beans. The burger itself was not tasty but I did like the slaw and the bread. The idea of French fries on the burger were ok but they were cold and bland. I would not order the burger or chili again. The tots were good but nothing special. Will give it one more shot though."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros. Lives up to the hype!  Loved the Cap & egg sandwich! I'm not a fan of regular coleslaw, but enjoyed the texture and flavor of Primanti's!
A must when visiting PGH."}
{"text":"An amazing sandwich if your hammered drunk. Eat one of these and you'll be sober before you walk out the door. Great Coke."}
{"text":"This is becoming such a go-to spot for us! We came in tonight and ended up putting in a table on the no wait app. It only took a few minutes and we were seated quite quickly. 
Brooke was our server and she was incredible. She was efficient and super nice. She made sure we got a drink in before happy hour was over and she even brought us extra pico de Gallo for our chips. She is a real hustler! 
When it was time to order, obviously I was a little difficult and she didn't sweat. I also sent her on a man hunt to find a dressing that is free of animal products and she had no problem at all helping me out. She came back with the red wine vinegar dressing. 
Our beers came fast as super cold with a fresh orange slice ! 
I had the garden patch salad with fries and my hubby had the fish Sammy for lent. We loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Stopped  in on a cold Thursday. Recently have been trying not to eat dairy, but was craving a Primanti Sammy! So I asked for the cheese combo with no cheese, he said no problem! Sweet, they added onions too! It was actually very yummy and filling. The food came quick and of course hot. Our beers were cold and we enjoyed our time."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles.  I live in Dallas.  And I've traveled to the north, south, east, and west of this great country.  So, I've been around the food block to know a good sandwich when I see one... and the sandwiches here are off da hook!  It's probably unlike any other sandwich you've ever had (unless you're a Pittsburgher, duhhh).  Who puts French fries on a sandwich?  And piles on the sweet and sour cole slaw?  On soft, thick sliced French bread?  Primanti Bros does!  

I was in town for work, and of course had to catch a Penguins game...  and was glad to see how close this place was to the arena!  My co-worker and I came here afterward and were majorly impressed.  The corned beef one is sooooo good.  I seriously was sad when it was finished, haha.  I'm sure it's not super healthy, but it didn't feel unhealthy either.  It wasn't greasy, there weren't too many fries on it (a good thing, it was balanced well with probably 8-10 fries on top), the slaw was fresh and crisp, and the corned beef wasn't too greasy at all.  That soft French bread is the perfect surrounding for it all.  

The place itself is cool.  It has a nice patio facing the Square, and the inside has a cool diner feel to it.  Service was great and quick, parking was easy... but probably because it was late on a weeknight.  Metered parking, but it was free at that hour. :)  There aren't that many spots on the street, so during the daytime lunch rush or weekend I heard that there is a parking structure nearby.  Oh and prices?  Very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  One sandwich is around $7-8.  I think my sandwich had around 8 slices of corned beef, so that's a great deal. 

Also, for what it's worth... we heard from native Pittsburghers that this one in Market Square and the other one on The Strip are the only two you should go to, as the other locations are not up to the same quality."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned by others, when visiting Pittsburgh you must go to Primanti Bros.  Well, this time around we did and I can say I've been there.  Will I be going back?  Probably not.  The grill and dining area is located in a separate section behind the bar.  

The menu is pretty big with a variety of options, but pretty much all of the sandwiches include a ton of dry coleslaw and french fries.  In fact, you don't even have to order a side of fries, you can just take them out of your sandwich! 

Be sure to try the fried pickles, they were pretty good."}
{"text":"My brother talked this place up and wanted to take us there. After eating there, I'm not really sure why. There was a bunch of us so we ordered several appetizers including the zucchini, mozzarella, and mushrooms. All of it was ok, but nothing worth talking about. He also insisted we try the Pitts-Burger, which we shared and was honestly not just underwhelming, it wasn't very good at all. I ordered myself a gyro, which shouldn't even be called a gyro since it's not actually gyro meat. And they shove fries in and on everything. I won't say it was horrible, because it wasn't, but it also wasn't good. I'd give it 1 star except the server was helpful and attentive and the restaurant wasn't dirty."}
{"text":"How to have the best Primanti's experience:

(1) Bring cash.
(2) Go hungry.
(3) Be prepared to wait.
(4) Add an egg to your sandwich.
(5) Don't bother ordering anything other than your sandwich.

My favorite has always been a bacon, egg and cheese, but pastrami and corned beef are also must haves. The bread is fluffy and fresh; the fries are thick; the slaw compliments any combo; and, the overall effect is a whole tasty meal in your hands.

At off times, services is incredibly fast. During the weekend and late at night, wait times for seating and food service can be slow, but the wait is worth it. 

(Side Note: If there's an old lady there selling baklava, try some.)

Whether it's 2am or after a long day walking through the Strip, Primanti's should be a planned stop for anyone."}
{"text":"The sandwiches definitely don't taste the same when you're not in the Strip District. And the service isn't the same either so don't expect piping hot food delivered nearly instantaneously. However, if you just want some Primanti's and you near this location, it will suffice."}
{"text":"Always love Primantis !  My favorite part of there sandwiches is the coleslaw, it adds a nice crunch to the sandwich!"}
{"text":"First -- I made the bad decision to go to Primanti Bros when I was only moderately hungry.  Bad idea.  Don't do that.

When I arrived, I stood there like a dope for 8 minutes until someone finally seated me.  I could see 15 empty tables and I was a single.  Irritating.

Then, I got the single most wobbly table I have ever sat at.  I was going to move, but frankly, I checked the one next to me and it seemed marginally better so I gutted it out at the gyro scoping table.  Irritating.  How can a restaurant make its customers sit at crappy tables?

Thankfully after that intro, it got better.  Friendly waitress.  I got a side salad, which was surprisingly decent for a gastro-pub.  I got the meatball sandwich which was great. Meatballs the size of pool balls and the whole Sammy the size of a Duke Jr football.  It was quite tasty.  I'd recommend it.  If the roll was toasted, it would have been epic.  No toasted roll was a bit of a surprise.  The fries are awesome!

If I was starving, or, had just run 26.2 or 13.1, this place would get probably 3-4 stars.  It is the definition of \"gastro\" pub, because trust me, my gastro will be working overtime tonight."}
{"text":"Amaze-balls!!

 I got the Pitts-Burger Cheesesteak which is #2 best-seller (and per them there isn't a #1 lol go figure right)...honestly I have NO CLUE where cheasesteak part comes from in the title unless Pittsburgh's definition of cheesesteak is WAY OFF from the rest of the country but its more patty melt than anything.  It was cooked perfectly - no cow left yet wasn't jerky! 

Here's the groundbreaking thing in my Foodie world...I consumed cold slaw! If its one thing I will always list as something I will never be a fan of its SLAW (gag) but this packed a surprise I was delighted to receive, the slaw has vinegar kick, there was no mayo in this and for that I say THANK YOU! Seeing how whe you first trying the sandwich you don't want to be rude and ask them to remove toppings lol.

Usually any kind of white bread is not my thing but it fits this, plus more of an italian bread that was very soft which makes unhinging your jaw to down this massive sandwich that much easier since your not biting into a bread-brick!

The fries were amazing like fresh cut that day or something

I give it 4 stars for simple fact its so unique in flavor...can't wait go back to try some different ones"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me as a \"Pittsburgh institution\"' and it certainly did not disappoint.  I'd describe it as definitely catering to the college age crowd, though it was chock full of business professionals and other satisfied looking patrons during our noontime visit.

The joint's claim to fame are the piled high sandwiches served with coleslaw and fries ON THE SANDWICH.  At the cashier's recommendation for a newby, I went with the pastrami sandwich.  The flavors all worked great together, though I would absolutely recommend jazzing up your sammy with some of the available hot sauce. 

I can absolutely see why this place is a local favorite.  If there was a Primanti Bros back home, I'd definitely work it into my regular lunch rotation.  Thanks for the great lunch!"}
{"text":"having heard stories about the amazing \"primanny bruddas sammiches\"  for weeks leading up to my visit, i was pretty stoked.  and the corned beef with coleslaw and fries did meet expectations.  

but here's where i screwed up: i ordered the small beer. nobody told me they would have 2 sizes of beer! so, when i returned to the table with a measly 12-oz beer, i couldn't understand the looks of disgust on my friends' faces.  until i looked at their supersize beers and realized i was, indeed, every inch the wussy new yorker they always suspected i was.  

so, hear it from me folks.  save face.  get the big beer.  that's all."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted and told we could help ourselves to a seat if we were eating in. Our drinks were served quickly and the burgers came about 5-10 minutes later. The staff was very friendly and ready for soda refills. The place has crisp air conditioning which was nice considering today was in the 80s. 

As far as the food, the bread was fresh and the fries and cole slaw on top were excellent. Keep in mind everything is included in the sandwich itself and not as sides. The slaw had just the right amount of vinegar on it and totally worked in the veggie southwest bean burger I got. The meal was huge and neither of us could eat it all. If I lived nearby I would have taken the other half home for later. This was my first time here and I will definitely try to make it back if I'm in town."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and the place was packed so full that we took a seat at the bar.  I was expecting to have the most fantastic sandwich I have ever had but it was the most bland sandwich I have ever had. 

I ordered the pastrami and there were a few scraps that didn't taste like anything.  The sandwich came with a PILE of French Fries and a PILE of coleslaw on the sandwich.  I would have preferred the French Fries on the side as they were pretty good fries.   As for the coleslaw it was good but I do prefer the creamy style coleslaw.  The bread they use is fantastic!  My husband had the #2 steak burger and it did have a little flavor but still not that great.  He ate his sandwich as prepared and didn't dissect it like I did mine.  Even dissected it still wasn't that great.

The service here is NOT good or welcoming.  It might have been better if the poor girl serving us had a little more help.  The sandwiches came out fast however, if you need anything else, don't bother to ask unless you want to see some attitude.  

I guess if you are interested in an \"experience\" this would be a place to go when you are not really hungry.  I wouldn't come back here personally nor would I bring anyone here.  Just saying..........................."}
{"text":"Best stuffed sandwich I have ever had. We need a Primanti's in California."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited after seeing people rave about it on TV.  I've been to dirty places before and I am a fan of dives.  But when it comes to unsanitary conditions, this place takes the grand prize.  

Slaw and fries were ok, but the meat on my cheesesteak was an artificial \"beef patty,\" about five steps below a McDonald's burger.  It was more like a low-quality meatloaf.  

If you want fries on a sandwich done well, visit the famous grease trucks at Rutgers University."}
{"text":"Excited for a new spot to grab food/drink in friendship area. My group had salads, pizza, and sandwiches. Sandwiches are always a winner obviously, but the salads and pizza were just ok. We also had sangria which was very good - comes in a huge glass for only $3.25. The atmosphere is great at this new primantis location - lots of tvs and lots of people sitting at the bar having a drink. Will definitely be back! 

Update: I have returned to this location multiple times as I live very close. We have had relatively good experiences here, but we're charged for celery and blue cheese with our wings. I pointed it out to the waitress who said the price shown in the menu includes the price of celery and dressing, but it's broken out on the receipt. Can't be true since 8 wings are 6.99 and I was charged 7.99. Just kind of a bummer that the staff doesn't even know what their menu says!"}
{"text":"We went to Primanti Brothers while visiting Pittsburgh this past weekend. My sister-in-law recommended this place and we went for lunch. I ordered the chicken breast sandwich with cheese, fries, and coleslaw in it. Yes....the fries and coleslaw were IN the sandwich! I also ordered a sweet tea.

That was my first experience with coleslaw made with vinegar. That was really weird! I have to say, the vinegar overpowered everything else. After a few bites, I had to wipe off the coleslaw. The sandwich was much better without it. The chicken breast was very good. The sweet tea was better than the tea we have in CA, but it was not as good as the sweet tea in Atlanta.

I liked the big portion...even though it was a heart-attack on a plate. I'd go back again the next time I'm in town. (Overall grade: B-)"}
{"text":"Once upon a time...before profiteering became more important than product, there were a lot of good food items to be had.   Anyone remember when Twinkies or Ho Ho's actually tasted like food, and not like chemical compounds?

Well, the same applies to Primanti Brothers.

Once upon a time, there was a little sandwich shop in Pittsburgh that was trying very hard to be like the famous steak sandwich shops in Philly.  After all, Pittsburgh really wasn't (and still isn't) 'known' for anything other than dirty steel mills, followed closely by closed steel mills, and the mill workers who sat around waiting for them to reopen, even after they'd been torn down and the property turned into malls.

Primanti Brother at one time was a decent sandwich shop with a quirky gimmick.  They put your sides ON the sandwich.  Yes, you could get a steak sandwich piled high with your favorites...french fries and cole slaw...in addition to the usual lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and cheese.

As time rolled by, the restaurants sprang up in several locations around the city, primarily anywhere that there might be a mall nearby, or a bunch of drunks who really didn't care WHAT they were eating, and there even sprang up one of the shops in Ft. Lauderdale.

As the business grew, the Primanti Brothers started cutting corners to maximize profits.  The meat became nothing more than Steak-Ums, and they started adding everything under the sun that could be served on a bun to their menu to try to draw in more people.  A nice healthy chicken breast...grilled in the same grease as everything else and topped with fries and cole slaw. 

Now, anyone not from Pittsburgh should know...native Pittsburghers are not exactly known for having distinguished tastes...in anything.  In fact, people in Pittsburgh will stand and give a raving standing ovation and scream 'faaaaabulous'...for what most folks around the country in more metropolitan cities would say 'eh'.

Last year, I had jury duty.  The Pittsburgh Courthouse is located near one of the many Primanti grease pits.  I thought I'd try a fish sandwich since I was on a limited budget for the day, and time was too short to sit down in any other restaurant.

Greasy, didn't taste much like fish, the batter was soggy from the grease, the cheese clearly came in little squares from a plastic package, and even the tartar sauce couldn't make it more palatable.  My stomach felt rock laden the rest of the day.

More recently, a couple from San Francisco came into the store where I work, which is near one of the Primanti restaurants.  They'd heard all the hype, and had lunch.

The woman said to me: \"WHAT is up with Primanti?  Everyone kept telling us we had to have a Primanti while we were in Pittsburgh!\"

She looked at me, rolled her eyes, stuck out her tongue and said:  \"Bleeech!\"

I shrugged my shoulders and told her I agreed.

I guess we could say that Primanti is kind of the White Castle of Pittsburgh, only with more \"GOOOO Steelers\" - ambience.

It is best eaten after a drunken bender, when you aren't really hungry, but are the type to eat like you're at a trough after guzzling half a keg of beer.

Or...you think McD's is fine dining.

Don't buy the hype.  The gimmick of the fries and slaw on the sandwich doesn't make it a decent meal.  Just means you're gullible to local yokel advertising.  And sadly, there really isn't another thing in Pittsburgh that stands out."}
{"text":"Quintessential Pittsburgh sandwich place. Great drunk food. Don't come here if you're looking for gourmet food. These sandwiches are heavy, down-to-earth, artery-clogging, and real. That's all I have to say. I wouldn't come here sober haha. Also, the wings are excellent."}
{"text":"I really didn't enjoy anything here. They man handle your sandwich throwing everything on it smashing it up. My boyfriend got the chilli and he hated it, overall the soda was good and the butter bread with the chilli. I guess open 24 hours in convienant if you're drunk and don't care."}
{"text":"Ordered three sandwiches to go and had one beer at the bar while I waited. When I placed my order to begin with, I asked for lots of extra mayo, Red Devil sauce, and a Coke to go as well.  When I received the food, none of the sauce was in there. I had to find someone and ask for it again. While I was driving home is when I realized that the bottle of Coke was not in there. It was not worth it for me to turnaround and go get it. Lastly, not once did anyone thank me for my order, my payment, or my business. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the food was decent."}
{"text":"Just moved to Pittsburgh and decided to try Pittsburgh's prized food chain ... and let me tell you I was ready to move back to California after trying Primanti's.  This was AWFUL.  I wasn't even able to finish my sandwich.  Practically inedible.  The meat was nasty.  Do yourself a favor and go to Smallman Deli."}
{"text":"Deece.

I guess I was expecting more with the hype. The restaurant location is pretty easy to find. We didn't have to wait as we went in between lunch and dinner times. 

The sandwich wasn't as flavorful as I expected. Kind of bland. The fries left a lot to be desired.

Go and try for yourself to say you've had the famous Pittsburgh sandwich."}
{"text":"A must for bringing tourists,  or a fix if you haven't been in a while, but not fabulous.   Nostalgic yes.  Good quality and value?  Meh. Last visit ordered the spicy fried pickles.  Heat scale 1 to 10? Actual temperature a 2. Spiciness,  a dialed down American 3. Poster price was 4.99,  paper menu and charged price was I believe 50 cents more. Served room temperature at best. 

Price discrepancy for Ragin Cajun chicken as well. Ten cents more.  (Which was really dry and chewy.) They should update their signs.  Manager comped me a drink to make up for it,  but really didn't get a sense he cared.  To be fair,  staff had just been crushed by a ton of middle school kids on a field trip.  A bit more enthusiastic staff and a better eye for quality and I might come back more."}
{"text":"A real feel for Pittsburgh at a reasonable price. We order the burgers and they came with the fries and coleslaw inside. It's not your average coleslaw it's more like a vinegar sauerkraut. I loved the breaded pickles snd vegetable soup served with JUMBO slices of sourdough bread slices . 
This was perfect late night hot spot after skating I the MASS MUTUAL skating rink."}
{"text":"Don't bust out the pitchforks but I may have committed the ultimate faux pas in Pittsburgh history.  I went into Primantis and ordered the spaghetti.  \"Wait, what?!\" you say.  Let me explain.

I was a young and innocent city transplant and was taken to Primantis by a very insistent local.  I noticed a chalkboard sign for spaghetti while trying to deciper the menu.  Sold.  I walk up to the counter, and with a shamefully straight face, place my order.  Crickets.  I guess I appeared so adamant that they actually brought out some chefboyardee in a styrofoam bowl.  

I slid into the booth and happily munched on my canned noodles while my date buried his head in his hands.

The noodles are top notch but I hear the sandwichs are even better."}
{"text":"What's not to like! Fries fries fries! Fries on everything! Apparently even the salads have fries on them. I had the pastrami and cheese! The portions were huge! And I love the fries on the sandwich! We also had the Smallman street fries which were fries with jalepeno, cheese, bacon and sour cream. Yummy! 
The waiter we had was super friendly and accommodating for the kids we had in out group."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. This is an old school vibe place that makes me feel truly American and I loved the fact that various types of people visited (we were a group of Arab/Mexican/White ladies)  for one common cause--a good meal! The food was beyond belief...fries in a sandwich!?!  I stuck with the steak and cheese and a side of chili cheese fries, both great! I will be back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Of course I had to try the original primanti sandwich while visiting Pittsburgh. And of course I probably went at the busiest time- Saturday afternoon at about 12:30. There was a long line wrapped around the corner of the building. It honestly moves pretty quick. I was a party of 3 and waited about 30 minutes outside. People are usually respectful that this is an in demand place, so they don't take too long to wrap up their meal and get the check. Once your seated, a waiter comes to get your order. I recommend starting with a beer while deciding which French fry stuffed creation to order. I went with the pittsburger - this was a thin hamburger patty with a heaping handful of fries and coleslaw piles between two slices of French bread- yum! I only ate half of this beast in the restaurant and took the other half home.. It's filling. Definitely a must try if in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype I'd say. A must see place in the Steel City!

When people say to split a sandwich here they aren't joking. I split a roast beef and provolone with the cole slaw and fries (on the sandwich of course). The roast beef is thin cut and served hot almost like cheese steak meat with the provolone melted on top. They also add lettuce, tomato, vinegar based cole slaw (I hate mayo and liked this cole slaw since no mayo), and of course a ton on fries to the sandwich. The fries are actually pretty good on the sandwich but combine that with an Iron City beer (great beer) and their chili cheese fries (chili was good but they use \"fake cheese\" sauce which hardens in your stomach like a brick) and you'll have a great Pittsburgh meal that you won't even be able to finish before you get full. 

Where else but here can you get a sandwich like this for about the price of a Subway sub? I'd say you'll take 20 yrs off your life if you eat here more than once a month though!

Oh and this being Pittsburgh they of course had the Pens game on every TV in the place. It's great if you're a Pens fan but good luck trying to catch any other sports on the TV!"}
{"text":"My initial introduction to Primanti's began about a year ago with everyone insisting, \"You have to go to primanti's! They make these amazing sandwiches piled with french fries and cole slaw. It's a Pittsburgh institution!!\"  Well, to be honest, they said the one thing that will keep me miles away from any peice of food - cole slaw or more particularly a cabbage product. Trust me, if I don't want to be around myself when cabbage is in my stomach, no one else does.

My actual first visit to Primanti's was just last week. After spending a night out with the guys, we decided we needed some grub. We were at Smallville's, only a few doors down from the strip district Primanti's which I believe is the original. The bars had just closed. The streets were littered with the scantily clad and utterly drunk. I was neither drunk nor scantily clad!

The place was packed with a ring side view of a man sweating over a hot grill and smushing fries and coleslaw with his hands onto said sandwich. And then another guy smushing and cutting the pile of intestine turning \"staples\" and handing them across the bar to the awaiting group. 

This is not the place for the timid. While not typically timid, my mindset viewed Primanti's (at 2:00 am when swamped with drunken masses) as a sort of \"soup-nazi\" mentality on ordering. While my friends insisted I could order a sandwich sans-cole slaw - something about the whole grilling, smushing, and well...smushing really. . .just did not intice me. And beyond that, I fears a random riot or glare of disgruntlement from the cook who was indeed \"on a roll\" with his quickly produced orders. When we ordered there were over 10 orders on the grill that were completed (WITH COLE SLAW) while we waited in line. The numbers were not letting up, people were coming in behind us...

On the other hand, they did have chili fries on the menu. Never one to turn down chili fries, I gave my friend some money and stood back while he went to order.  He was told he can only order french fries on the other side of the store (the bar side which was packed with drinkers and diners). He goes over there, to the bartender he knows no less, and was summarily told that there were three people ahead of us for chili fry orders. . .in the \"don't bother\" mentality. They wouldn't take his order or his money essentially. Honestly, I was sober, I could have waited but at the same time - if the state of the front grill was telling - I didn't want to know why making an order of chili fries in the back may be too time consuming for me to bother. Bucket of chili, fries, smush smush...how hard can THAT be.

So while I can see Primanti's for its historical/regional value (and I am sure if sampled drunk. . .no wait. . .my stomach just isn't that strong. . .), it's definitely not for the weak of heart or stomach. On par with the cheese steak legions in Philadelphia, its definitely worth experiencing.  And everyone who could stomach it (primarily men, I believe I was outnumbered almost 1 to 7 there) live and die by this food. So for that reason, I give a rather nuetral 3 stars...I would definitely take someone there, but I am not sure I will ever eat anything myself."}
{"text":"My husband placed an online order tonight and it said it would be ready at 7:42; I went in around 7:45 and the order wasn't ready.....which was fine. I sat down to wait and more people kept coming in for seating, including a table for 20....the wait staff didn't have a person manning the front so people came in and stood for 10-15 minutes before someone even asked them what they needed. I waited for over 30 minutes for a take out order that BTW ended up coming out and no one called my name or told me it was ready so by the time we got it, it was cold. The wait staff were  horrible; just refused to make eye contact as they walked past the front area crowded with people. I also got zero apology from the person that eventually gave me my food. Never. Again."}
{"text":"OK, so the french fries and cole slaw are served on the sandwich, which is served on wax paper.  That doesn't make the bread anything better than plain white and didn't make our service any better than fair.
Primanti's used to be special-single location with good service, open into the wee hours, and uniquely presented sandwiches.  Now it's a local chain, widely imitated, and no longer special."}
{"text":"I give this place 5-stars. Although it took about 30 mins to get my sandwich it was well worth it. Especially with the line being out the door. The sandwiches here are HUGE!!!! Good luck ladies trying to finish the whole thing in one setting. I got the colossal fish sandwich and it was amazing. Piled high with fries, vinegar base coleslaw, cheese and tomatoes--Ahhh man it works!! I added some hot sauce to mine. Great place to just chill and get full for around $10 w/a drink. I will def go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Is cold french fries on a sandwich a thing? The sandwich tasted great after pulling the cold fries off. Neat place but needs a good cleaning. I guess if your immune system needs a workout this is your place."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Being a displaced Southern Belle I have always loved Primanti's. a true Pittsburgh tradition. I called my lunch in and asked if I could get it to go but eat it there since I may be short on time. The bartender, who I later found out was the person that took my order was a little snotty about me wanting them to have it made ahead of time. Almost made me feel like I was doing something wrong. Meh... Whatever. The rest of the staff were great ad I still enjoyed my lunch. For the bartender... I am going to drop it a star. I was going to give it four. It's difficult to get a five from me. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and want to eat like a local!  :)"}
{"text":"When I entered the area of Pittsburgh I was staying in I sought a place that would be showing the Washington Caps game. So here I  came.

Sports bar with lots of tv, most showing UFC,  none in the dining room showing the caps. 

I was seated in a booth in the bar where they were showing hockey and there were other caps fans. 

The staff ignored me for a good 15 minutes but once  a server woke up she was good.

Ordered the Philly burger.  I don't think it was a burger or food. It was suspect at best.

All in all perhaps it you are a drinker it's a great  place but if you're not it's not."}
{"text":"I read several mixed reviews of this place.  I'm from the Philly area and I was thinking that this might be like the hype you read about Pat's or Geno's cheese steak.

This location has a very large parking lot and the restaurant is pretty large.  It was very clean and we were seated quickly.

I had the waitress pick the sandwich for me and I got the sirloin steak sandwich.  As you've read a gizzillion times, it's cut white bread, fries and slaw on the meat.  Although the fries seem like they had been sitting around for a while in the kitchen, I was pleasantly surprise at how much I enjoyed it.
It's not a lot of meat, but it's also not a thin layer of nothingness either.  The ratio of fries and slaw with the meat really worked well for me.

The atmosphere was great because Pittsburgh sports fans are enthusiastic.  The Pirates game was on and there was a lot of cheering for their hometown faves.

It's worth the trip for the vibe and for the grub."}
{"text":"What a bummer.  When I ate at the one on Steubenville Pike, I was happy with their service and sandwich.

This joint really disappointed me.  First of all, I had to wipe down my table and get our placemat/menus.  It took forever for our server to finally get to us.  I get it's busy, but WTH, hire more people to serve the patrons.

Then I ordered the pastrami sandwich.  Lots of fries.  Lots of coleslaw.  Lots of bread.  Okay with the cheese.  Then I asked, where's the pastrami?  Well, where was it?  

I was sorely disappointed and wish I had gone around the corner to that burger joint that I know I would have been happy with. 

The rest of my family felt the same way too.  Unless you like eating a french fry, coleslaw, cheese sandwich for $7 and wait for a long time, I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Watching Packer's game in Steelers Nation what more can I say.

Ordered the Pittsburghier & Cheese and it was delicious to the last bite. The bartenders were very hospitable and were on it each time my glass went empty. The city was a little dead that day and they were closing early but the bartenders provided the best service I would definitely come back again. A special bonus was there were a few other Packers fans in the bar which made the space even more inviting. There was no Go Steelers or nothing like that from anyone no harassment so overall great time, great food, great drinks. If you haven't eaten here before go for it. I read mixed reviews on the food but my Pittsburghier was delicious. Go Pack Go"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, and four for the experience....that's the best way I can start. Have the corned beef, NOT the steak. Both were quite passable, but the corned beef was much more of a standout, and I was left wondering what animal the steak had actually come from! We went before a Pirates game, so the dictum to come early was in our case very true. I'm guessing that would apply for most any major event in downtown Pittsburgh. Just off Penn Ave. in a former warehouse/commercial area of town, be sure to visit the candy shop (you'll wish you were 6 again!) or the fruit/veggie market across the street afterwards. Close to everywhere in Town, but seems like a whole different vibe from any of the other places around. Def go to the original, NOT the one in Market Square."}
{"text":"Beyond Belief!!!!!!!!     Capicola or the Pittsburger is off the Chain Good!!!!!   A+++++++"}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge fan of this place but recently the service has been very disappointing. I ordered online and it said the order will be ready in 8 minutes. I drive to the store and notice they are busier than usual. I try to get one of the employees' attention but they ignore me. After waiting 10 minutes I ask to pick up my order and the guy says it will be 30 minutes sorry and walks away. I come back to the store 20 minutes later and ask if my order is ready yet and they scramble around and say here's your online order. The bag was greasy, cold and when I got home I saw did not add the extra meat. If you want primanti's my advice is to go to a different location with better service."}
{"text":"As a Pittsburgher this place is a classic! Must Visit!
Cap and Cheese is the go to. Perfect flavor balance with the saltiness of the capicola and fries and the sweetness of the coleslaw."}

{"text":"There was a line out the door at the Strip District and Market Square locations so we drove to the Southside location and walked right in on a Sunday afternoon at 1 when the NFL games were starting. We were able to sit at a table in the back and received table service from there.

It's been about 10 years since I've had Primanti Brothers and it's just as good as I remembered. I ordered the Pitts-burger. Great combination for a sandwich: super soft bread, vinegary cole slaw that provided a little crunch, salt from fresh cut french french fries and a little sweetness from tomatoes to balance everything out.

In and out in about 30 minutes and left very satisfied. I would recommend this location  if the downtown locations are busy and you don't want an excessive wait outside. They also have good drink and food specials during football season."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches on the planet! I'm a fan of pastrami and cheese. You can't go wrong with anything. 

If you haven't eaten here before watch them make the sandwiches so you know what you are ordering. Some people don't like the slaw and fries on the sandwich (I couldn't imagine why) but you can order that stuff on the side (I don't encourage this but you can).  The Primanti's in the Strip is the orginal so if you really want the experience you've got to go here but the food is the same at just about all the spots around town. 

It is a unique place with great food and is 100% Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I had been to one of their locations in Florida and when in Rome....I was really looking forward to eating here and made it a priority while visiting Pittsburgh.  I ordered the turkey sandwich and it was ok, not great.  The nice thing about this place is that the sandwiches are inexpensive so if one doesn't fill you up, two or three of them isn't going to cost you a whole lot.  The waiter was nice enough and refilled our drinks in a timely manner; however, I just wasn't that impressed by the sandwich.  It wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be and if I had been by myself (wife was with me), I might have ordered another one.  The fries and cole slaw are decent and they do give you a nice amount of each item.  I simply can't say that I would go back here if given the opportunity.  Maybe if you are in college and need a cheap meal, I'd say go for it.  I do think that everyone needs to try one of these sandwiches for themselves, though.  I just wasn't overly satisfied and I think I have tamed my Primanti Bros. craving for a long time."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try these guys out after I saw a different location featured on \"Man vs Food\". The sandwiches, while good, were not as good as I'd hoped. But they are definitely big and hearty portions and decent, just not the best I've had. I had the ham and cheese, overall it was a bit on the bland side. I did manage to eat the whole thing with just a few fries left over (and somehow was hungry again within the hour!).

Service was good, everyone was very nice. I would try them again because maybe it was an off-night when we went and food not as good as usual?"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it but just didn`t do it for me. I understand these sandwiches are a PTG staple and a must try, but the taste was lacking. I feel they recommend you put hot suause on it b/c it needs that moisture and layer of flavor, but the really disapointing thing was the slaw; I love onions but the slaw seemed to be 90% onions and was a little over powering. The staff was nice and helpful but overall i belive the \"greatness\" of this place is hype."}
{"text":"Talk about the hostess with the mostest!

My sandwich was huge and delicious. And they all come packed with fries, tomato, and coleslaw. Admittedly, I'm a coleslaw snob - it's one of those things that can go so wrong so quickly - but I absolutely love it here. I would have ordered it as a side in addition to being on my sandwich if I knew was I was in for. All I ordered was a sandwich and it was definitely enough to eat for lunch. All the flavors together are what really make it though, so don't go picking the fries out and eating them separately. ;)

I subtracted a star for a couple of reasons - the child size Dr. Pepper I got was over $2 and that left a bad taste in my mouth. Plus they didn't do a great job keeping the lunch rush organized. I get the seating is first come, first serve, but I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't gone there with regulars."}
{"text":"It was worth the long walk over from where I was staying, I'd have to say that much! I figured this was a cash only place but also did not realize how small they are. They did have a few seatings for small groups and bar stool sitting for those (which was many were) come alone for a meal before heading to their destination. The guys were super friendly and everything was quick. 

I loved the pastrami sandwich that was filled with pastrami, cheese, cole slaw (even tho I'm not normally a fan) and fries. There is no right way of eating it OR a clean way of eating it for that matter. It WILL fall apart on you. I was ambitious and got the hot chilli also which I was glad I did ... but my stomach yelled at me for stuffing so much in there in one sitting. If you're a light eater.... you may want to pack the other half. The best part is,  you can kick back and have a beer for like $3 (coors) with your meal."}
{"text":"Of course Primanti's is a Pittsburgh classic due to hearty french fry laden sandwiches on Mancini's tender white bread. My favorite location of the local chain is this one in Market Square.

Even on a busy summer Saturday evening the service is friendly and caring.

Also: I have a happy Christmas memory of eating a big Primanti's meal in the outside Market Square patio section...and enjoying hot chocolate that they seasonally served which was great in the nippy air and surprisingly great with the sandwiches.

In addition to the famous sandwiches the deep fried pub pickles are also yummy."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend and Pittsburgh native. It was horrible! Obviously I'd never been there when I asked for a menu and duh! it's on the wall. Got a beer, made a decision, waited 10 minutes to order. Placed my order for a double egg and side of fries. Food came out quickly. Fries were cold and soggy. Sandwich was horrible. In part bc it was not what I expected. I took one bite and pushed it away. Bartender never asked how I was doing,could she get me anything. I finally out my credit card out for payment. She processed it and then asked if I'd like a box. I laughed out loud, said \"no\" and left."}
{"text":"I wish I could find a pastrami/corn beef sandwich stuffed with cole slaw and French fries in Los Angeles!

It has also been a tradition for the late night crowd to go to Primanti's after the bars have closed. Crowds line up with standing room only; however, the cooks prepare the sandwiches at a very fast pace and keep the crowd moving. This place can be hit or MISS but it's definitely a must-try for the first time visitor to the City of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went to college in Pittsburgh & Primantis was probably what I missed the most after moving away. I love the sweet sausage, egg & cheese. Last time I went out to The Burgh I brought home 3 sandwiches to the Philly suburbs. Not as good after the long trip but they still held up! I have eaten at 3 of the other Primantis around the city and they are good but not the same as the strip district shop. Nothing better than a Primantis sandwich & an IC Light!"}
{"text":"So what if this place has been around for a while.  The food is terrible.  The only \"logical\" reason for coming here is if you are ridiculously wasted.  And I don't mean drunk, I mean you forgot your name and you are feeling pretty hungry, so you stumble in.  Other than that, there is no excuse for eating here.  You are simply wasting your money."}
{"text":"Disclaimers, I guess: I was here on St. Patrick's day and the line was long and rowdy, and we took our food to go since there was no seating. I had the kielbasa and cheese sandwich, and by the time I got to sit down and enjoy it probably 30 minutes had passed. The kielbasa was good, the coleslaw seemed good, but overall the sandwich as a whole did not live up to the hype. The French fries weren't anything special, and they honestly didn't seem to add anything positive to the sandwich. I had some cheese fries too, which were soggy and the cheese had practically no flavor. 

It's possible I'd enjoy the food more if it were fresh, but I don't think I was impressed enough to return the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The hours are convenient, service was fast and friendly, it was right next to my hotel so that was nice. The food was okay, generous serving of fries, general bar food selection nothing special and bun was stale on my burger."}
{"text":"The only reason why this location, specifically, gets a 4 is because of the bathroom - it was gross and downstairs. If you had an elderly man who maybe couldn't climb the stairs, he would have a really tough time, unlike the women's room which is on the main floor. Our seating was a little tight, there were TVs which was nice for the games that were on. The atmosphere was very lively which made you feel at home- away from home, which was a plus. No complaints about our waiter, he was quick and attentive and everything he needed to be. Our food came up really quick. Their style of sandwich is probably different from what you are used to but it makes this place what it is. I definitely recommend the Founders' Favorite, which was what I got. The sandwich was SUPER yummy. It was overflowing with wonderful goodness. It wasn't messy and it was very filling and honestly I don't know how I finished the whole thing, and I eat a lot. Would return, especially to this location because of everything nearby."}
{"text":"So convenient after a night of partying...

They're open 24 hours! What could be better? 

I had the double egg & cheese sandwich with bacon. So good, and wonderful after the abundance of alcohol consumed at the club earlier :-)

Service was very fast. Even on a Friday night at 2:15am with crowds of people. Waiter was very nice, and he remembered our orders without having to write them down. 

Will definitely be my go-to place after late night Strip antics."}
{"text":"This is a must stop whenever I am in Pittsburgh, which is monthly. Food is well priced, good, lots of cold beers on tap and the place is clean. What else do you need? Tr"}
{"text":"The Pittsburger is amazing especially with egg! This place is on Carson St which is the party street in Pittsburgh. This place is open super late and is always busy on the weekends. There is no better food after a night out on Carson."}
{"text":"You know I've seen this place showcased on Food Network about 5 times in the span of 5 years or so and it looked delicious.    So during Prego 2012 (the wife) we went on our last trip prior to Ava being born to Cleveland, Ohio (I already know...relax).

So we spontaneously map the drive to Pittsburgh cause we're just wingin' this shit.  Drove 2 1/2 hours and wow were we disappointed!  I know, we sort of set ourselves up for disappointment by driving over a hour with lofty expectations but oh well...we do what we do.  How can you go wrong with pastrami, coleslaw, fries on Italian bread?!  The entire thing needed more flavor...some au jus maybe, some salt maybe?  

On TV it looked like salt punch from the pastrami or corned beef, the starch and salt from the natural cut fries and Italian bread is the pinnacle of bread (for me) would be a perfect marriage but come to find out it's just a standard marriage with room for improvement (not ours dear).  I wanted to LOVE this place so much...hopefully it gets better.

All in all a great place to stop by for the nostalgia and what not but don't get your hopes and expectations in the way."}
{"text":"I moved from out of state a couple yrs ago. And I heard really good things about P-bros. And then they put one in down the rd and I had to go. It is worth all the hype. The sandwiches are awesome. I don't even like coleslaw but I love these sandwiches. The only thing left for improvement would be the service. I know it's new and they are probably working through a few kinks, but the service was slower and the food took a while to come out. When it did it was cold."}
{"text":"Visiting from Florida, we were too told that a stop for sandwiches at this landmark was a must. After a thirty minute wait outside to be seated then another twenty for food to arrive, the final product did not prove to be as solid as the experience. Glad that we made the stop and knocked it off the list. - 7/3/2010"}
{"text":"As an out of towner I got lost of recommendation as this is a Pittsburgh must. The sandwiches and fries were so good. In Ohio we are used to creamy cole slaw so know that it's not the same but still really good!! The portions are so big and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"customer service is always nice but dont you all think that this place is little over-rated? Their 'Almost Famous Sandwitches' need some hard work to get famous. Basically, this place is like Dr. Pepper soda. People are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers serves as a sort of museum for Pittsburgh's Strip District.  The streets are sealed in tar much the same way Primanti cakes their sandwiches with fries and coleslaw.  It just works.  Everything about this place fits in well with this righteous and proud community.

If it's good enough for Bruno Sammartino, then it's good enough for me!"}
{"text":"Normally, I'm a super picky eater. Everything has to be separate, and not touching each other. (I know, maybe a little OCD, but hey, we all have our issues!) 

My friend picked me up from the airport, and took me STRAIGHT here. Wow! He warned me of the concoction that I would be receiving, and that everything would be mashed together. I started to panic, but hey, I kept an open mind! 

Fast forward to deliciousness.....WOW! Super great! I had the black angus sandwich, and mmmmmmmmmmmmm I'm still thinking about it! 

The bread was amazing, fries super good, and the black angus, pretty tasty! 

This really is a must stop for any visitor to this fine city!! 

PS--CASH ONLY here!"}
{"text":"I understand Primanti is a historic institution here in Pittsburgh but other than the name I don't think it has much going on unless you're in the mood for quantity versus quality. I got reeled into my experience because everyone said to try it when I moved here. Really simple menu as you just choose the meat you'd like in your sandwich. I went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw, tomato, french fries and bread was just okay and made it soggy as I finished the second half. The sheer size of it all was just too much too. I wouldn't return again, though if you're visiting and into doing Pittsburgh touristy stuff I would say you would need to experience Primanti to judge for yourself."}
{"text":"If you're reading this review you're either really bored or don't live in Pittsburgh.  Primanti's is a local favorite. I have personally been eating at their various locations for 20+ years.  They offer large portions with reasonable prices. The food is nothing amazing but it's good. The signature item is the sandwich. It's made on two slices of thick sliced Italian bread with fries, cole slaw, and your choice of meat.  The #2 best seller is listed as the cheesesteak. It's kind of an inside joke as the cheesesteak is a crappy steak burger patty.  The locals mostly order roast beef, or my favorite capicola.  If you're really hungry you can add a fried egg. If it's lunch time you can also order a slice of pizza, slices are not available after lunch.  Anyway, if you're visiting the burg' I highly recommend you try it at least once. It's loud and kid friendly and great if your here on vacation or visiting relatives."}
{"text":"Just as I remembered. Took my wife and kids by for a sandwich (as only Primanti can do) during a Steeler's game while we were visiting relatives for the holidays. Nothing compares to a Cap & Cheese, Primanti Style, with a cold Iron during a Steeler's game. Some things just work together..."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh, but it really does depend on what you get. I suggest the Bologna, Capicola, or Pastrami with cheese and I don't even like Bologna! These sandwiches are excellent! My twin sister loves to get a fried egg on her's, which is also very tasty. 

My favorite thing here is the coleslaw! It's very simple, not made with MAYO, which I love! The fries are on the sandwich, typical Pittsburgh, so good!

In a classic dive, working man's place like this, who cares about service? It's served to you on a piece of parchment paper, not even a plate. If you need a drink refilled, go to the counter and ask. It's really not that big of a deal. If you are looking to be pampered and treated special GO SOMEPLACE ELSE TO EAT!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Pittsburgh's iconic sandwich place but it just wasn't good. I had the Pittsburger. The meat was dry, grey, and flavourless. French fries in the sandwich were soggy and had no seasoning. The ingredients and cooking just weren't there. A disappointment."}
{"text":"Well I tried Prim. Bros. once before, at a downtown location and like it a lot.  Believe I had either corned beef or pastrami.  This time I tried turkey and roast beef.  Bleh!  Turkey tasted chemically.  Rest of sandwich not much better.  Would have been like $12 for a sammy and a beer but they took the sandwich off the check because I didn't / couldn't eat it.  Don't think I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Did not like.  The first time I tried Prim. Bros.  I thought it was okay.  That was at this location.  The next time was a location in Greentree and I thought it was awful.  Today I found I don't like the food from this branch anymore either.  I had the sirloin steak sandwich.  Made my stomach make noises and it tasted weird.  Have to say the service was very nice here but I think I'm all done with the chances for them.  Sorry people!"}
{"text":"Great location and very affordable for lunch or for grabbing a few drinks. This is the only location that still has a pizza oven and Primantis pizza has become a staple option for me.  I alwaya get their Italian hoagie or the signature with ham and salami with fries on the side. If you want a burger order their 1/2 lb burger,  I would not advise anyone trying the \"pittsburger\" its a gray \"meat\" pattie. Overall compared to other locations this is my favorite and the food is always on point."}
{"text":"Great, attentive service with great local Pittsburgh decor - Go Steelers!  The food, traditional favorites that add slaw and fries to sandwiches or pizza, is delicious!  If you want a taste of \"Pittsburgh\" look no further!"}
{"text":"It's only okay. I compare this to the sandwich juggernaut that is Melt Bar & Grill and it falls short on all accounts. However, as a casual sandwich place, it's not terrible. 

Portions - average. I can finish the whole sandwich in one sitting.
Creativity - not too many options to choose from. The fries being INSIDE the sandwich turns them soggy and flavorless. 
Taste - very mediocre. Cole slaw is one of my favorite sides and it was bland and too vinegary. The bread they use is not grilled or buttered or anything. Weak.

My husband originally raved about this place being so filling and just what he needed. Later on he tried Melt and forgot about this place entirely. I asked him again what he thought of Primanti's and he chalked up his initial reaction to not having a sandwich in a long time. At the time, it hit the spot."}
{"text":"I would actually give this place a 3.5, but I couldn't bare giving it only 3 stars. Maybe because it's such a \"Pittsburgh\" restaurant. A must try once type of deal. You have to order the #2 most sold item. The cheesesteak. It was quite good. Really good. Why 3.5 and not a 4 or 5? One I wish it was hot, maybe it's not suppose to come out? Not totally sure. Also was a little dry. Which for a cheesesteak is kind of shocking. Though great, not over the top. Though it could have been because they were quite busy and only a couple girls on the floor. Must have been an unsuspecting rush. Which I don't care. Perhaps why the food wasn't hot. Understandable. 
Service was the nice, quick and to the point. 
Would I go back? Damn right I would."}
{"text":"Primanti's it's a Pittsburgh institution! When my husband and I lived in the South Side we'd always stop by Primanti's on our way home after weekends out of town, so happy to be back in Pgh. I always appreciate that they leave off the coleslaw when requested, and you can't go wrong with a bacon and cheese w/ egg. Being able to add an egg is key b/c this is a great place for a no nonsense brunch, in addition to a filling lunch, and life-saving stop post last call."}
{"text":"Their sandwich scared me. It was way too overwhelming. i'm still contemplating if I ever want to go back...."}
{"text":"Dined here on Jan. 15 and was not disappointed. Had the fish and cheese sandwich. Fish was crispy and flaky and the fries and Cole slaw on top were delicious. Came back for dinner and had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, which was nearly as good. Stayed away from the steak and cheese like some reviewers recommended. 

Service at lunch and dinner was speedy and courteous. And the great thing was that unlike Max & Erma's, Primanti Bros. was open until 2 am."}
{"text":"French fries are the shining star here... 

Wonderful service, great prices, classic dive in a working mans section of the city. 

The Pittsburg \"thing\" is the Pitts-burger. Fries and slaw right on the burger. This sandwich. I desperately wanted to love this sandwich, but, I didn't. It was soooooo dry. A hockey puck really. So sad. The bread was like fluffy white clouds, the way white bread should be, the slaw was amazing not sweet and very fresh, the fries were so great, but I had to choke it down. 

We got a side of fries and they are rich dark golden brown with squishy mashed potatoe centers. 

I'd come again simply for those fries! And a beer."}
{"text":"Absolute Yinzer classic! Doesn't get better than this folks! Definitely a must to take your out of town guests, I recommend the original in the Strip District! It's open 24 hours, perfect for a drunk snack after the bars. (Don't drink and drive kids) 

Last time we went I got the \"Pittsburgher\" which is a burger on that amazing Italian bread, sandwiched between a tomato, fries and slaw. Perfection!

The atmosphere is a little divey. Keep in mind it's been there, in that location, since the 1930s. I wouldn't have it any other way!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here at about 11:30pm last night. Saw all the great reviews plus my friend recommended it! They helped us quickly and the food came out just as fast. Sandwiches were AMAZING. I got turkey and cheese and oh my that coleslaw was fantastic! Fries on it too...so good! Only reason it's 4 stars is because he never dropped the check and then at the resister we were ignored for a few minutes and then he had to ask us what we got. Also, after they drop the food they kind of just abandon you so be prepared to go up to get a refill or anything else you need. Otherwise, great food!!"}
{"text":"I know it's just sandwiches but they are AWESOME!  I had capicola and cheese, Darcy had fish and cheese.  They were very good.  I LOVED the capicola!  Spicy and tangy.  The tots with the Parmesan sauce were a good side, and a single order is big enough go two.  The service was fast - took more time for us to decide what we wanted!  All in all, the best sub I've had in a LONG time!"}
{"text":"Primanti Bros. does not disappoint! I had the Ragin' Cajun Chicken sandwich and it was amazing!  Stuffed with a spicy chicken breast, perfectly cooked fries & a vinegar based coleslaw that was to die for. Shout out to Julianne was so helpful with recommendations, super sweet & kept the food & drinks coming, she is so on top of it. Come visit her and Julianne will be sure you leave here stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Ferguson joined me on a business trip here and wanted to try the famed food network acclaimed Primanti Bros. So we did.  It is now crossed off his  bucket list with heavy, angry lines that ripped through the paper in spots.  To those of you with it on your bucket list cross it off now.  It may have been a great place when you were rolling through town with a load of pig iron and had 15 minutes to fill your gullet but it currently has no redeemable value other than the kitschy idea of putting everything on your sandwich.  

Bread - big,thick fluffy pieces that consumes the sandwich,
Meat - under proportioned for the size and quantity of bread. 
Slaw - yes.  There's also slaw in sandwich.
Fries - precooked.  Soggy.

So many other things in Pittsburgh to try. Heck, potato filled pasta pockets (pierogis) have more character.

So no more. Food network hype."}
{"text":"Went to this place after a friend recommended it as it was a must try thing in Pittsburgh. Came here for lunch and the sandwiches were very mediocre. There was really nothing special about them. They were, however, not bad either."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite place in Pittsburgh.  I ate there yesterday afternoon with 3 colleagues.  2 of the guys were from Canada and this was their first trip to PB's.  We were all blown away.  Our server was such a sweetheart and took great care of us!  I had the Cappicola & Cheese.  It was marvelous!!!  Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 stop here for lunch today. We arrived before 11:30 so was able to get in within a few minutes. It has been a few years since I have been to this location. I must say I was fairly disappointed, Not only with my food which was average, but the entire place seemed extremely dirty. When my feet are sticking to the floor, that's a problem. They have limited seating on the inside, and they do have a covered patio area with heaters which was where we were seated. They pulled some tables together and accommodated us which was great. But the floor on the patio was literally so greasy and dirty it was very disgusting. The tables are patio table style, metal with holes in them. They as well we're not clean. I put paper towel down in my area just to be able to have a cleaner place to eat. Also used the restroom while there, (men's room is in the basement) and it as well was not very clean and smelled. If it were not because I was with a group, I most likely would have left. This establishment is known for their sandwiches, which all come with fries on the sandwich. A Pittsburgh novelty. I elected for a salad with Cajun chicken which was decent, but nothing to write home about.Several others had sandwiches which they all enjoyed. The service was very so so and we constantly had to ask for drink refills if we wanted anything. I never did get my second refill. Probably not a place I would go back to nor recommend."}
{"text":"Primantis has always been a pittsburgh favorite. This primantis is the original! Fast service, open 24/7 awesome food. Can't ask for much more. The cole slaw is awesome the fries are kinda bland, bread is soft and yummy! Very good place for a sandwich drink and fries!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big Primantis guy.  I used to go all the time for lunch when i worked in the area.  Dollar lunch pizza slices are clutch.  I go cap and cheese, but the Pittsburger, fish sandwich, and chicken are all also very good.  I like how the NFL primetime games in the burgh also do a quick promo for Primantis.  Yeah!"}
{"text":"Well I have to give it to them it was pretty damn good. 

Me and my fiancé came here because we were in Pittsburg and we were told we had to try this place out I was skeptical at first because when we walked in it took forever to find a waitress.. But as soon as a waitress arrived she was amazing and very fast as well as correct with our orders I'm just going to review what I experienced.

I started the by ordering the chili with cheese as well and the street man fries I believe it's called. The chili was amazing and just the right size it came out quick and it was hot and spicy which is how I like it the cheese melted off of it and it tasted like home made chili instead of proceeded chili. The fried were spicy and hot as well they had peppers and melted cheese on the top of it, it had the perfect amount of fries mixed in there.

I ordered the corn beef sandwich for my main course i guess and it was huge and amazing I loved it, it was full of corn beef and had coleslaw loaded with fries and it came out almost immediately after we finished the sides which is perfect time.

For our drinks we both ordered the sunk ducks and it was humongous and mixed perfectly and it came with a small rubber ducky inside of it.

The service was incredible, I believe we she was actually a hostess but she couldn't get the waitress or waiter to serve our table due to it being extremely busy so she took care of us and she did amazing she was fun very nice and she knew everything about the menu which is good for us because my fiancé had Aton of questions.

All in all this was a great experience. Great waitress great food and great atmosphere. If we are in Pittsburgh again we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is lengendary so naturally as a tourist - I had to go. I can sum it up in one word YUM!! Staff was friendly as we sat at the bar and watched the cook in action. I have never had a sandwich quite like that with a coleslaw like substance and fries on it, but I'd gladly eat it again. Lively fun place with people to match. Great for a quick casual bite."}
{"text":"I've been to 3 of these places now.
Thick plain bread, cole slaw and fries on a sandwich?
Most places would boast of the MEAT on a sandwich - 
not the vegetables.
I cannot understand why people like this place...until I 
see that most of the 5-star ratings are from Pittsburghers.
Of all the local foods of all the cities I've visited - this is 
right down there with Cincinnati's \"chili\" as the worst."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic sandwich. Service was great and the atmosphere is very fun. Definitely the place to go when visiting Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here! And the first time I was there the male daylight bartender was very rude to me. So I decided to go again hoping he wasn't there. I'm sitting here now and he continues to make facial expressions as he make peoples drinks. He didn't acknowledge me when I came in! So I decided to sit at a table instead. A other guys comes up to the bar and I believe he had an expired ID and he couldn't be served (understandable), but the laugh and talked about them to another customer. I'm a state employee and have seen it all. But someone or manager need to Check him. 


My waiter was very nice and attentive"}
{"text":"The original!  Primanti's offers such a great cheesesteak/fries/slaw combo. What I enjoy so much about this location is that it probably hasn't changed a bit in years. It is a necessary stop on a visit to the Burgh. 

There's nothing typical about a primantis cheesestrak.  The bread is thin and airy but is always savory and delish. The steak itself would not be much to yelp over except that it is accentuated by heavy fries and a mound of slaw.  It is so stacked that you could almost use a fork to devour it."}
{"text":"Great \"sports bar-ish\" Pittsburgh favorite. Nothing healthy, but if you're off the diet wagon and want to pig out on great sandwiches and shakes, it's really good."}
{"text":"I always stop here when I'm in Pittsburgh. Pastrami was good. Servers were friendly. Left with a full belly."}
{"text":"Another one of my go to places for lunch when I'm in Pittsburgh.  I had the corned beef sandwich with a raspberry lemonade.  Always a great experience. Friendly service in a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overrated. The sandwiches were not as BIG as I were told they would be. Nothing fancy about them, in my opinion very mediocre. I support local
businesses and Pittsburgh seems to have a lot of pride in this place, but it's nothing special about it. Keep in mind I'm not from Pittsburgh, I was visiting and I wanted to try a local eatery. Primantis Bros was recommended to me and sadly I was dissatisfied on the quality of the sandwich. For such a long wait outside I was anticipating more of a premium tasting commodity, not a substandard byproduct."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, not being from Pittsburgh, all I had to go on was yelp and photos ... and the photos looked, well, we'll call it interesting.... I mean I like all the ingredients, but fries and slaw in the sandwich.... hmmm.....

Yeah, it works.

The slaw is delicious, the fries are perfectly cooked, and when you bite into the sandwich the flavors go perfect.

My mistake was not doing double meat.... the sandwich is big, but the standard meat portion will leave you hanging.

Cool ambiance in market square - it was a beautiful day and being out on the patio section was outstanding.

Only downside is the drink sizes don't match the sandwich size and they are busy that it's tough to flag down the refill.... but still highly recommend you trying this place if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"I'm a Philly Pats and Genos guy but when in Pitt nothing beat Primantis Bros. we ordered a Pitts-burger, loaded Pastrami, Loaded Cornedbeef, Loaded Cajun Chicken and a Steak ( no tomatoes ) we also also housed three ordered of cheese fries. 
 Took the hotel shuttle down to the restaurant and sat in the back of the left side dinning room. What a fun and nostalgic place, that has a lot of character. After we finished we walked back to the Hotel ( Residence Inn Marroit ) next to PNC Park where we watched the Pirates beat the Nats. Great game! Took us about 25 minutes to walk it and got to see a bit of the city, crossed the Andy Whorl bridge taking photos along the way. Great sandwiches and very nice people working at Primantis"}
{"text":"Monday night.  Called our order in ...picked up 15 mins later.  Walked in to pick up and place wasnt packed.  

I ordered a fish sandwich.  NOT good at all!  The fish barely covers the bread!!!  They piled on the fries and slaw.  But hardly any fish!  

Next was my SMALL STREET FRIES.  For over $4.00 I EXPECT REAL BACON..NOT IMMATATION BACON BITS!!! OMG!  I had to feed these fries to my dog!  FRICKEN GROSS!!!!!  Along with the great big pieces of pinto beans.  :(  This is horrible.  I was so looking forward to this food!  

Thanks for letting me down!"}
{"text":"THIS is the best primantis of them all! I had the pastrami and cheese and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this one! It's a good sized sandwich and don't forget to ask for onions. We got their chili cheese fries on the side which are nothing special but still good. And this place is open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"How can this place keep bringing out cold food? I'd like both my fries and sandwich warm at the same time just once.  I usually get one warm, today, after 45 minutes both were cold"}
{"text":"How far is heard about this place on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives one time when I was watching it and I've always been a huge Pittsburgh Steeler fan so I was like man I'm going to try this place one time when we go up to Pittsburgh and we did and I even saw the one lady that yells everybody it doesn't seem too friendly is that I saw on the TV she was there and she wasn't the nicest this place has what I like to call Nostalgia I guess for a lot of people because they just love it for some reason because they throw coleslaw and french fries on a damn sandwich and call it a day they won't take the coleslaw if they want take the fries off so you kind of get what you get but I enjoy it it's kind of like a yo-yo here it is take it leave it whatever in the Strip District of Pittsburgh which I really like also kind of salami kind of dirty but I like it kind of grimy but it just kind of fits kind of fits the hard-hitting nation of the Steelers so I'm definitely go back 4 out of  Stars"}

{"text":"Yeah, I know, it's the famous \"Primanti Brothers.\" An institution in Pittsburgh. A rite of passage for locals and travelers alike. To be revered and spoken of in only the most reverent tones. I have several Pittsburgh born co-workers who know my love for food and recommend this as the \"best sandwich in the 'Burgh. Started as a 3 a.m to 3 p.m. food cart for nearby late night truckers in the 1930's, Primanti's has grown tremendously, and everyone, foodie or not, has to go there. Or so it seems. Adam from Man vs. Food; Rachel Ray; National Geographic - they've all been to the \"Shrine of the Primanti's\". Well now I have, too.

Although they have expanded to 20 stores in PA, and three in Florida, If I am making the trek, I might as well trek to Mecca - The original Primanti's in the Strip District, just a mile or so northeast of downtown. Brightly illuminated and highly visible with enough exterior neon to make a strip club jealous, the Strip's Primanti's sits in what deceptively looks like a \"rough neighborhood\". Nearby are a number of nice little restaurants and bars, and if you stay reasonably close, there is nothing to fear, appearances aside. Walking in you will find nothing special. Brightly lit with a food prep area and a couple of employees behind a counter with bar height backless stools on the left. A moderate amount of evenly spaced tables and chairs along the wall to the right and down the center aisle. The menu, as well as some minimally artful local sports depictions, are painted on the wall. There is a moderate selection of sandwiches, with soup, chili and fries available here. None of the Nachos, salads, wings and deep fried items that are available in the suburban stores. No, not here. No Potato Boats, Hoagies or Pizzas. No kids menu. Exotic here is chili and cheese on the side order of fries.

After sitting for several minutes in a relatively empty restaurant, I finally walked up and got myself a beer at the counter. I picked Iron City Beer, a premium lager from a local brewery, the Pittsburgh Brewing Company. The beer was pretty good for what it was. A working man's beer in the Pabst Blue Ribbon or Old Milwaukee style. Nothing wrong with that. It goes perfectly with the Primanti Bros. Experience. A Young's Double Chocolate Stout or something similar would be entirely out of place here, as would the person ordering it. I placed my order when the beer showed up. I stuck with a classic: Pastrami and Swiss. I was told - \"Sorry, no Swiss - only provolone.\" The menu mentions Swiss, but tonight, for some reason, it was only Provolone. Missing the sharp bite that Swiss provides, I pass on the cheese. Bread is thick cut Italian, no other option. Cole slaw and the fries (a Primanti \"Secret to their success\"), comes on there too, unless you ask otherwise. Onions on request - so of course - I request. 

Served on a piece of paper, the sandwich doesn't look like anything special. I tear open a few packets of Grey Poupon, spread those around, and dig in. And the pronouncement on the Legendary Primanti Pastrami is ----Meh. Bread is OK, a little dry. The fries add nothing, they are better eaten off the sandwich. The slaw is fine, it's actually quite nicely seasoned, and there is a single tomato. The sandwich is cut in half. The pastrami itself? Pretty good, but not as much Pastrami on there as you would think upon first look. While the sandwich seems thick, the meat is more of a \"ball\" in the center giving the sandwich it's height, than it is a \"crust to crust\" adventure. It's maybe a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would be disappointed if this is what I made at home and served to friends. And they would get it for free. Almost $7.00, and completely overpriced compared to an equivalent elsewhere. 

Apparently a life changing event for some, I found myself deeply disappointed after all of the hype. Even based on the \"Diner or Dive\" scale, I was still less than impressed.

I leave, pushing past the semi-drunk crowd of younger folks pushing in for a late night bite. Perhaps they'll think it's great, I certainly did not. I wanted to, I really, really wanted to. But sadly, I did not. Sorry my friends, I tried."}
{"text":"We were told that a visit to PIttsburgh was not complete without a trip to Primanti Bros. We tried to head to 3 different locations in downtown and the lines were out the door and around the corner. Luckily we found this location in a small neighborhood with locals instead of tourist. 

When we walked in we got lucky as a table just opened up. We sat down and were quickly greeted for our drink orders. The server came back for our food order and then it all headed down hill. She mixed up our order with another table and told me she would bring my sandwich shortly. Well that turned in to asking her twice and waiting over 30 minutes for a sandwich. By the time I got my food everyone else was finished and I was STARVING. She also forgot our cheese fries and took forever to take the bill. 

I am glad we tried this place out, but their sandwich's were not that great and the service sucked. Sorry Primanti Bro's we tried."}
{"text":"Can't beat $0.49 wings on Sunday. Decided to try one of the new Oktoberfest sandwiches and it was amazing! Well worth the cost and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to these massive sandwiches since the last time we were in the area.  The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere was very cool. Full belly without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"OK, I am a total slob, so I had been dying to try Primanti Bros. since I heard of the fry on sandwich gig. My eldest and I planned a father/son sports trip to Pittsburgh since the EAGLES were playing the Stillers. Yes, sorry to say the 'lil creep is a Steelers fan, but what better way to teach him a lesson than to watch the birds beat up on his team at home.  Sorry, I digress.  That being said, our first stop in town was Primanti Brothers in the Strip District.  I ordered the Pittsburgher while Liam ordered the Roast Beef and Cheese.  Boy were we excited.  Soon after we ordered the sandwiches arrived on wax paper looking oh so good.  Time to party!!! 1st bites, yeah this is good.  2nd bites...I like it how bout you (unsure glances)..3rd bite a capital, MEH.  To quote my son, \"it was ok, it's just like eating food.\"  Nothing special....any corner deli in Philly blows the top off this popsicle stand.  So in a nutshell, glad I went, you should too, but move on after your visit to better things...."}
{"text":"This is a must go if you are in the Pittsburg area. Every seat in the restaurant was full, but they were quick to seat our group. I have been able to try serval sandwich options. 

The Bologna was as good as a bologna sandwich gets. Because of all the addition on the sandwich (the fries, veggies, and sauces) the bologna flavor was not overpowering, but just right.  

Capicola & Cheese very good. I liked the meat flavor and combination of sauces. 

Pastrami & Cheese has been my favorite so far. It was just enough spice and the pastrami was delicious. I had some trouble eating it as at the sandwich is so large.

These sandwiches are big enough to split if you usually eat small meals like me or more then filling by them selves. 

Make sure to put your sandwich with a beer! If you are in Pittsburgh this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"You can't visit the Pittsburgh area without trying a Primanti Bros. sandwich. Luckily there is one located in North Versailles, my wife's hometown. If we need a quick lunch or we are meeting up people Primanti's is usually the go to location. 

As you know, the best part about their sandwich is that they put the slaw and fries in the sandwich. These sandwiches are HUGE and I have a hard time finishing one. I usually get the Black Angus Top Sirloin or the The Pitts-burger.

This location has a great wait staff. They never let your drink get empty. The food comes out fast and hot. I have not been to other locations but the one in North Versailles is top notch."}
{"text":"Makes me sad to write this review. I have been coming to this location for about 6-7 years. Every time we come to visit family this is one of our first stops. Tonight may have made it a last one!!

We came in and it wasn't busy, that's a first for us. I expect to have a little bit of a wait time, or even a little lesser service, because we have small children with us. 

However this evening was hands down terrible!!!! We placed our orders, and it took FOREVER!!! Not even the kids food came out to at least help bide the time we were waiting. When it did finally come out that's when it really took a turn for the worst. My Neice ordered the Mac and cheese. I took a small bite to make sure it wasn't too hot. The dish was lukewarm. It was also supposed to come with a side of applesauce. That didn't bother to show up until we were almost completely done with our meal. My brother in law ordered some wings, there was hardly any sauce on them.  We asked for some additional sauce, that too didn't come till the very end.... An when it did the sauce was straight out of the refrigerator. When we spoke to then manager about our experience ..... the freezing cold sauce in particular, he seemed as if this was common practice. I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1, because our sandwiches were amazing as always. Even though it was quite the wait. And I'm hoping that that this was our server Maria's first day....praying that she gets better over time."}
{"text":"Unreal! I typically never eat cole slaw, but this is one place that uses it so well in the sandwich that one pretty much has no choice but to dive right in. There is usually a wait to get seated, as everyone wants to eat this sandwich. If you don't know it is served on special bread piled high with hand-cut fries, cole slaw, cheese and meat of your liking. They have tons of memorabilia and have been around forever. In addition, they're open late. There are many locations, but the original one is by far the best."}
{"text":"Good place to eat when you're drunk but I have had better fries in many they locations and the sandwiches are so so. Not a big fan to be honest"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love primantis. There is nothing more pittsburgh then this place to me. However I was pretty disappointed in the service this time. The food was great the staff was friendly. Sadly not very attentive. It took almost 15 minutes to be waited on. Needless to say I will be back because who doesn't love fries and coleslaw on a sandwich."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Nice casual place when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"For a place that prides itself on sandwiches, their bread - arguably the most important part of the sandwich - is just outright terrible. I gave up flavorless and textureless wonderbread in like 3rd grade. If you want a real sandwich that is made for adults with taste buds - go to Dibella's. 

I do like the beer selection, though. And the fries are pretty decent. So 2 stars."}
{"text":"Good Lord.

When it comes to tourist spots, it doesn't get more touristy than this. But I guess that comes with every city. 

Before coming to Pittsburgh, I was advised to make a trip to Primanti Brothers because of their famous sandwiches. I just didn't know how good they would be, until now. All their sandwiches have meats, french fries, coleslaw, tomato, all piled up high and they are just fantastic. My friend got his with tuna, but I got the traditional Pitts-burger. This was one great thing to enjoy and was able to eat the whole thing. It took a minute how to figure out how to eat it, but wow was this good. 

The location is also great as its on the Pittsburgh \"strip\" and was not terribly far from PNC Park, so it gave us great proximity and a overall base as to getting a feel around the city. Plus all the walking will give you a chance to walk off those calories before the Pirates game begins! 

For this spot, it is okay to be a tourist. Just get here like we did before the lunch rush, otherwise you could be staring at a really long wait. But this was worth it! Plus the prices were amazing too! Awesome!"}
{"text":"It a small but cozy place, they serve the food quickly so many people can eat. Delicious and it is excellent for after Steelers game, also has tables outside so you can enjoy the view when weather is right. They also have music the tables are comfortable"}
{"text":"You're on Yelp, right? So I assume you're actually reading these reviews. In which case you have no excuse for thinking this place is going to give you anything more than what it does -- warm meat and melty cheese with a handful of fries and another handful of vinegary cole slaw between two slices of soft fresh Italian bread. (Sit at the counter and you'll see that I'm not kidding about the handfuls.)

So if that's what you're in the mood for, this is your place. It's a Pittsburgh institution, and it's pretty yummy. Although the fries could use some salt."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in town!! The sandwiches are huge and messy but soooo good. Must go to the original shop. All of the additional shops let you make changes to the sandwiches and the coleslaw doesn't taste the same as the original shop. They wait outside in the long lines for a reason, it's just that good. The turkey, rothlisburger, and the kielbasa are favorites."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in the Steel City. A real classic. Home of the stuffed sandwich often imitated but never duplicated.  I wish they had one in Chicago."}
{"text":"Heard about this sandwich for years. Finally got to try it and was very disappointed. Coming from a huge sandwich town in Philadelphia I was a little biased though. There could of been more cheese and melted. price and atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Dined here on October 23. Service was good, and the caricatures on the walls were super cute. Ordered the pastrami & cheese with a coke. The taste was fine, but nothing super unique. Not sure what all the hype is about. Apparently credit cards are accepted now, and one can get double meat for $1.99. Recommend anyone who has a good appetite to get that option. It's basically a regular sized sandwich on soft white bread with french fries, cabbage with mayo & meat. The cabbage with mayo seemed to be the biggest layer. They have a parking lot for customers, but depending on how many people are dining there, maybe small."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is a must have in Pittsburgh. I ordered the hamburger. So let's break it up step by step:  
1). The was nothing special. It tastes like something you would get at a super market.  
2). The French fries in the sandwich were too soggy; definitely not worth the calories. I ended up taking out all of the fries from the sandwich.
3). The meat was great! I truly enjoyed the softness and flavor. I added an egg to my burger and I enjoyed the enhancement. I am a huge egg lover!

I did not get the Cole slaw that comes in all of their sandwiches but apparently it is significant. I do not like Cole slaw one bit. So maybe I did not get the full Primanti Bros experience.
But I am still giving 4 starts since I really think they did a great job on the burger patty."}
{"text":"Good place for a sandwich at a Penguins game! The line is usually ridiculous, but they usually have everything ready by the time you make it to the front. I tried the Pittsburgher and was not disappointed. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting a taste of Pittsburgh at a game!"}
{"text":"JR H and I seemed to miss each other this weekend in Pitt. Always going to the same place yet not really.  Our little group, which inlcuded the parents(yeah i still get free food) went to the Market Square location. The location is nice. Market Square is a nice area. Brick inlaid street. Clsoe to 3 river point park and my hotel.
This restaurant is something one must do when in town. It was also on Food Network, and man times reviewed here at Yelp. The food is pretty good. Where else can you get a \"value meal\" between to slices of bread. The sandwiches for those just learning. Your choice of meat with some nice itailian deli selections, kolbassi(haven't seen that  on a menu i around SF), or fish, below a nice bed of fresh made and not too dripping wet coleslaw. Fries with that? Heck yes and they sit right on top.  All on a Itialian sliced bread. The have a daily beer special 24oz beer for about  $2.50. 
Now this place and the food is fun. The food gets better tasting as the hours get late on a night out. Think how great a bacon wrapped dog is after \"dancing\" the night away. You know that fun 3 step dance. Raise beer, tip glass, put back down. The kind of food and place you want to head when you cheat on your diet, watch some footbal and chat up with the locals.
The staff was very good. The food came quick. Best of all. It had no kick back later or the next day."}
{"text":"Try it once while watching the game or visit the location in the strip. Then you can cross it off your list."}
{"text":"Server was awful!! Had a group of 8 and he stuck us in a booth that fits 4! Never came around for refills service was not good. Gave people in my group attitude And stole my change... Just terrible"}
{"text":"Sooo good. The pastrami is delicious and the burger is tasty. Line was long but moved very quickly. Everyone was super excited nice and helpful. Loved it!"}
{"text":"So, I will say this...The restaurant is quite overhyped, however, for what the sandwich is, it was pretty good. We ordered three sandwiches, beef and cheese, corned beef and cheese, and ham and cheese. All three came with tomatoes, cole slaw, and french fries, on the sandwich. The bread was very fresh and cut at a good thickness. The fries were a little undercooked, the corned beef wasn't the best quality, the cheese was okay, the coleslaw was very heavily black peppered and a little under dressed. BUT, when you put it all together it was pretty successful."}
{"text":"2 words: Pleasantly surprised

After the mediocre reviews on yelp and my brother's average comments about this place, I was reluctant to try this place, but it was on MvF, so how could I not? I was in Pittsburgh for 20 hours (got in at 11pm and was leaving at 7pm the next day). Turned out my hotel was a few blocks from this location and it was open till midnight, so as fate would have it, I gorged.

I didn't want to mess up my one and only shot to get Primanti Bros, so I wavered and asked the employee what I should get since I was debating between the corned beef or pastrami. AHA! There was a corned beef/pastrami combo. DONE.

I really enjoyed my sandwich. Meaty, carby, cheesy, crunchy, delicious. The meat was nice and tender, the russian dressing was a classic addition, the fries were fresh and hot. It was all really good. Was it the best pastrami/corned beef, I've ever had in my life? Not quite, but it is damn good. I'd definitely go back.

I even ran back to my hotel at 11:30pm so I could hurry up and eat it and it was still good. Also, it helped burn off 10 of the 1000+ calorie dinner."}
{"text":"On my first trip to Pittsburgh I asked many locals what was the 1 iconic food/restaurant that I had to try and The original Primanti Bros was the hands down recommendation. Everything they have is some variation of a gigantic sandwich  In my group we tried the Pitts-burger, pastrami, fish (pollock) and egg  & ham/egg/cheese. If you are ordering any type of deli meat sandwich you will need to double up on meat.  Other than that it is definitely something a tourist should try. Locals seemed to like it as well."}
{"text":"Dieters and supermodels stay away...there is nothing for you here.

Great big honking sandwiches.  You've seen them on TV and maybe they seem like a gimmick, but they really work.  Love the corned beef especially.  This location is not as \"real\" as the one down in the Strip District, but it's pretty cool.

There's a long line to order but it moves fairly fast.  Getting your food is a different story, so don't come here in a rush.  However, do come here.  If it's too crowded in the restaurant (or at their outdoor tables), then grab a table in the Market Square across the street and ingest these delicious gutbombs.   They also have a great beer selection so you can finish a pint or two while you're waiting for your grub."}
{"text":"I feel 3/5 is fair bc it's more like 2.5. We live super close to here and were excited to have a Primanti's right down the hill bc we just love that it's relaxed, good for groups, and good food. Put it this way -our rehearsal dinner was at the Mt. Lebo location in 2016. I digress. This location however needs some improving. The difference in quality of food AND wait staff is noticeable. The food has never been outright BAD, but I have no time for crappy service. It's been a few months since we've gone (compared to probably every other week) because of our last visit. It was a pizza feast night and we ordered two fountain drinks while deciding if we were going to get that, then we did end up ordering it. That comes with a pitcher of pop/soda -which was never brought out to us but it really didn't matter as we had cups already. Long story short, we were charged for the two fountain drinks and when my husband asked the waitress about it, she informed him (with way too much attitude) that it was OUR fault for ordering those prior. I know enough to realize that fountain drinks cost restaurants pennies -that's why you get free refills. We both couldn't believe she was arguing about this so we just said \"okay\" and handed her the credit card. Upon her return she had taken the two drinks off and acted like she did us a huge favor. That was the icing on the cake of multiple less than great experiences we kind of just ignored -drinks never getting refilled, wait staff disappearing for 15+ min and coming back smelling like a cigarette, pizza being significantly less appetizing than other locations, burned wings, etc.  The convenience outweighed all of this previously, but not anymore. If someone suggests going here fine, but I will never suggest it."}
{"text":"everything is so delicious. our waiter Piero was hilarious. such a good man. we got our food in 10 minutes and it was packed. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Deep fried with cheese. Pretty uninspiring menu. It's a local classic, but it didn't wow me for anything. The service is excellent and the food came out quickly despite the place being busy. It has a great location. I'd go back for beers after eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time there, so good :) great food great people, we went back the next Day !! Wish Texas had one.."}
{"text":"After sitting there and being ignored for 25 minutes we just left!"}
{"text":"The service was right on point.  Next,  the hot sausage sandwich was nice especially the toasted buns wit added a nice crunch to the bite. the cheese was melted once again fully and perfectly. tomatoes were nice and juicy the sausage was definitely the star. it was spicy to a level you can enjoy the spice. the fries were crispy some were crunchy! Overall, had a very pleasant meal will definitely go back in and dine. did see a deal they are doing."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Friday night.  It's a casual vibe with inside and outside seating.  I ordered the spicy Italian sandwich.  The sandwich looked thick but it was mostly the bread and fries that made it look this way.  The meat itself looked to be a piece of meat and a piece of cheese under all the fries.  The bread was tasty as it tasted like like rye.  All sandwiches come with fries and cole slaw within the sandwich.  The cole slaw is a sweet and sour base instead of a mayo base.   

I gave 3 stars as the sandwich was average among the other sandwich shops available to choose from in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I get it: the fries in the sandwich is a worthy gimmick (heck the Yinzers put it under a green salad!) but the slaw in the sandwich should be copied everywhere.  Clever to use a wrap so there's no dishes, the sandwiches taste great, the bread is pretty good as well.  If it could look like a Carnegie Deli (NY) sandwich with the slaw it would take Pgh by storm.  Funny that the Yinzers are lukewarm about these but the tourists are gaga over them."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, and the price is hard to beat. Just remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"Don't expect anything great and you won't be dissapointed.
I got a bunch of appetizers that were on par with Applebee's.
There famous for putting french fries on their heros, I don't get it,
It's not that great of an idea, its kind of stupid to me!!"}
{"text":"Two words, Delicious and Cheap!

I travel 100% of the time for work with my team and we stop at amazing food places in cities across the country and this has got to be one of my favorites.  

The atmosphere is super casual, seat yourself.  It's pretty small on the inside, so you want to show up before the lunch or dinner rushes if you plan to have a seat.  Also, not the best for very large groups unless you get there outside of the rush.  We had 7ppl, 4 sat at a table and the other 3 at the bar.

I sat at the bar and got to see both Nick (Chef) and Sierra (Server) at work.  It was just the two of them and they managed a packed house like a pros. As hectic as it seemed to me, they didn't miss a beat.  Not  one order was missed or made incorrectly.  They worked really well together.  

My team got an array of items and everyone loved what they had.  I had the Ragin Cajun Chicken sandwich and it was fantastic.  Every sandwich comes with this super yummy cole slaw (made w/o mayo), French fries and provolone cheese.  The sandwich alone is more than enough food for one person, you may not want to order additional fries unless you're sharing.  The chicken had a perfect level of spice and it paired well with all of the toppings.

I will definitely be coming back for more the next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Tried it once. Not a fan of potatoes and slaw where the meat and cheese are supposed to be."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is one of those Pittsburgh traditions that I regret to say I've never quite been able to get into. I've been here a couple of different times, and the truth is that I think it's a bit underwhelming for the hype that it's given by locals. 

My first time here I got the classic Pitts-burgher sandwich, and I didn't really enjoy the fries and coleslaw piled onto the sandwich. There, I said it. It's just too many flavors going on at once, and I would prefer to have a side of fries rather than have them mashed onto my sandwich so that I can barely taste them. Ever since that first experience, I've asked for my fries and coleslaw on the side (much to the dismay of the waitresses, who look at me like I'm insane for not wanting them on the sandwich). What can I say? I'm from Cleveland. I just can't get into a sandwich piled high with things I usually eat as sides. After trying a few of the different sandwiches, I just don't find that they're anything to write home about. I enjoy the fresh bread of the sandwich, but that's about it. The fries are always a little soggy. If it's your first time in Pittsburgh, I absolutely recommend giving it a try since it's such a Pittsburgh classic. I just don't think I will be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"The Strip location is always a hotbed of activity.  Other locations, like Market Square, are decent but are more for the bar crowd.  The food has gone downhill over the past couple years; to me it is overrated but out of state visitors make me take them there like its some sort of pilgrimage.  Any time you see a program on one of the travel or food channels and it has anything to do with Pittsburgh you know Primanti's is going to be featured.  This really doesn't do anything for the reputation of the place because it gets built up to be some kind of mouth watering experience when it really isn't.  If you are craving a sandwich like this go to the grocery store and get some frozen fries, toss some burgers on the grill and make your own coleslaw - it will be a fraction of the price and you won't end up with two thick ass pieces of bread.  I'd love to give this place more than three stars (and ten years ago I would have) but now it's more about getting customers in and out than it is making good food at a decent price."}
{"text":"This iconic Pittsburgh place just doesn't live up to the hype.

I liked the concept - take all the ingredients you would find on the side of a sandwich and dump them IN the sandwich but it wasn't well executed. I've tried the cheese steak and the pastrami and wasn't blown away by either. The fries are a bit on the soggier side and the ratio of coleslaw to fries isn't right (too much slaw), but these factors don't detract too much from the sandwich for me (you can always remove some slaw). I think the main problem is that the sandwiches as a whole are lacking flavor.

Don't get me wrong - these aren't BAD sandwiches. I think it's definitely worth the experience to go once and see what it's like but the sandwiches could be a lot better."}
{"text":"Subway calls their line folks \"sandwich artists.\"  If those people are considered artists, then the cooks at Primanti Bros are friggin' Picasso.  
If you've never sat by the grill, you should, just to see them in action.  On a busy lunch day, it's not uncommon for them to have 15 things going at once, and they keep track of what's what via...broken french fries.  I've never seen or heard them get anything wrong, either!  While I wouldn't call them chefs, as the menu at the end of the day is simple, they definitely have a solid skill set at the griddle.

If you've never been to Primaniti's, here are a few tips from a seasoned veteran.  
Tip 1:  Always get fried egg.  Always.  On everything.  
Tip 2:  Pick up a bottle of hot sauce and sploosh it on the fries...those of you complaining about bland fries definitely need to try the hot sauce technique, as it makes a definite difference.  
Tip 3: The \"cheesesteak\" sucks and is a travesty that people are encouraged to order this abomination, as compared to many other items of deliciousness on the menu. 
Tip 4: I'm a  big fan of capicola (with egg) and the colossal fish.  The fish is huge, and you will feel like a fat kid if you finish it.  
Tip 5: A 23oz  \"Iron\" is only like $4.  Get one and talk like a Yinzer for a complete experience.

The Market Square location is just as good as the original in the Strip.  Oakland is meh, Southside comes up third in my book.  I haven't been to others.  If you're coming in from out of town though, any of them will fit the ill."}
{"text":"First time in this one and I will never go again. Out of roast beef and hot sausage at 4pm on a Sunday. The kids pizza was terrible. My 5 year old wouldn't eat it. It looked sloppy and tasted crap. I could make better pizza at home.
The service was slow and some stuff we ordered never arrived. Worst dining out experience I've had in a long time. My wife said her sandwich was good and mine was ok.
Skip this place!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty shocked that Primanti's doesn't have 5 stars across the board, but I guess some people don't know good food when they see it. 
I agree with the reviewer who said that people either love or hate Primantis, but personally I think the people who hate it just don't quite understand it. People: this is not gourmet food. This is greasy, artery-clogging trucker food. Adjust your expectations before going in, and you'll have a great experience. Don't go to Primantis if you don't want to get stuffed on bad-for-you-but-oh-so-good food. It's really that simple. 
The Oakland location is my favorite precisely because I love the dingy, dirty atmosphere. I enjoy sitting on the second floor and looking out over all the other diners enjoying their food, but it's also fun to pull a seat up at the bar and watch the guys behind the counter do their work. It's impressive. Plus, my boyfriend and I have discovered that the sandwiches served at the bar are actually bigger than the ones served at the table! (Not that it needs to get any bigger.)
My favorite is the double egg and cheese, though if I'm feeling crazy I'll add bacon. You can't go wrong with the sausage, either: sweet or hot, take your pick.  
If I lived in the Burgh, I'd probably go all the time and maybe get sick of it and want to write a bad review, but as it stands, the five or six times a year I get to enjoy a Primantis sandwich are some of my happiest food experiences."}
{"text":"For all the hype this was very disappointing. 
Just a bunch of random flavors (Bologna, coleslaw, friend fries)  that just seemed to cancel each other out. You needed the supplied hot sauce to give it any flavor. 
Skip it."}
{"text":"There are some places that are better when you grow up or at least have memories while eating at a restaurant. This was highly recommended to us while visiting Pittsburgh. First, we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a Sunday. We wanted bar type food with a couple of drinks. We were told to go there by several people. I got the capacola, great concept putting the coleslaw and fries in the sandwich but it just tasted bland to me. I asked for them to toast the bread but they said they couldn't do it because it sticks to the grill... \"Can't put a piece of bread on the grill?\" Again, when there a memories of this place I am sure the sandwich taste better than they really are. But as an outsider judging the food alone, it was sub par."}
{"text":"Yes, we made the rookie mistake of visiting on game day. Some of the staff seemed happy to be there and helpful. The food was good and unique, and the Black Angus Sirloin Strip Sandwich was quite large. Unfortunately, we had a really bad experience with service that was pushy, impatient and unhelpful. The server seemed completely uninterested in helping us. We could have walked out without even being noticed, but instead, we had to grab the server's attention just to pay our bill. Don't let this dissuade you from trying it out and drawing your own conclusion."}
{"text":"This is walking distance for me! I finally found a sandwich that I love- Angus beef sandwich.  i tried the fried pickles for the first time today and wasnt impressed by it. As others have mentioned, this Primanti Brothers is tougher to drive into from the hwy. I always drive through from the back so its easier for me. Theres a little side street entrance across from the CVS, you will see the Primanti Bros sign. Then just follow the sign to happy eating!"}
{"text":"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh classic, and I've always felt some sort of obligation to love this place. Although I can certainly appreciate the uniqueness of a Primanti's sandwich, I just don't understand all the hype. So there I was again, hoping this was the time I finally become a Primanti's fanatic.

The restaurant was very busy when we came in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was a bit of a wait, but the employees were efficient when it came to getting us seated as quickly as possible. Our waitress, however, seemed too preoccupied with other customers, so we spent a lot of time waiting to get her attention. Frustrating, but it is what it is. 

They offer two vegetarian sandwich options: the Deluxe Double Egg & Cheese and the Southwest Black Bean Burger. Both are good, and I've always preferred the black bean burger, but I decided to give the egg & cheese another shot. It was an average quality sandwich. Nothing mind-blowing. Though I usually love how they pile on the fries, these fries were so undercooked to the point where the insides were RAW. Once again, Primanti's, you have failed to impress me.

Purely because it's Primanti's, I will probably be back. If it was any other sandwich shop, no thanks."}
{"text":"I stopped here while visiting  Pittsburgh. I heard a lot about Primanti Brothers and figured I would stop by. The line was outside of the building, but the wait was not long at all. The atmosphere wasn't to inviting and the staff weren't really welcoming. I ordered the Colossal fish sandwich. The sandwich included fries and coleslaw. The fish was not fresh and I think that is because it was pre cooked and maybe leftovers. Other than that I will return when I go back but I will order something else."}
{"text":"this is a must try sandwich if in Pitt - the concept of putting the whole meal on bread is unusual - steak n cheese, fries and slaw.  it really works!  A fellow customer talked me into it and it was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in Hawaii, so when we were on vacation in PA we knew we HAD to stop in!
The time we went was during pregaming for the Steelers game so it was a crowded sea of black and yellow!
Service was fast, we sat against the window facing the street and drank giant yuenglings. I ordered their philly sandwich and my man ordered pastrami. I wasnt very fond of mine, it was sorta like a funny tasting long rectangular hamburger looking patty with the slaw and fries. My boyfriends was AMAZING though! No way I could finish more than one half.
It was a great experience!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the original location in the Strip since writing my Oakland review. It definitely is better overall than the Oakland shop (fries were better, and just tasted fresher), but still nothing too amazing. I think the concept of the sandwich just doesn't do it for me (See Oakland Primanti's review)."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are filling. I like the cole-slaw because it's made with oil and vinegar, and not mayonnaise. There's really nothing else to write home about. The meat is decent, but the fries on the sandwich are somewhat soggy. The fries and bread have the same texture, and so it's kind of the same consistency throughout most of the sandwich. Maybe if the fries were a little crispier it'd taste better, but that's just a hypothetical. A sandwich is about 7 bucks and certainly is filling, yet it's not all that palatable. I think it's mostly name recognition at this point."}
{"text":"I mean what else is there to say about this place that hasnt been covered???

Their sandwiches are a meal packed between two pieces of amazingly fresh Itallian bread. The fish sandwich is my favorite and the steak is where I go when I wanna change things up! Service is great, food always comes out hot. 

This time I tried the chili......It was cool outside, so I figured why not.....Its def got some kick to it!!!

This place defines the city it calls home to a \"T\""}
{"text":"A group of us traveled to Pittsburgh to watch our Anaheim Ducks against the Pens.  We had the opportunity to watch our team practice and afterward, a group of us decided to have lunch at the famous Primanti. We walked from the arena to the restaurant, which took about 20 minutes.  The GPS used off Yelp took us on a scenic route, and later we found out it would have been easier to take the Transit and get off the Gateway stop.

Seating inside is first come first serve and we grabbed a few tables. The menu had everything kind of sandwich you could think of, but according to the menu: it's not a Primanti Brothers signature sandwich without a generous serving of crunchy, tart coleslaw and crisp French Fries piled high on top of soft Italian bread.

I shared a pastrami sandwich with Stephen, and they were served on waxed paper, not even on plates. Indeed their sandwich was served on top of a layer of french fries, coleslaw, and cheese, piled higher than a mouth could open. Fortunately for us, our server tossed in a few forks.

My friends LeeAnne and Sandy chose not to get the sandwich, and shared the BLT Tots, while Karen had the Pitts-Burger.  Lunch was relatively inexpensive, and the sandwiches were large enough to share."}
{"text":"Great local fair in Pittsburg!  The Pittsburger is the best sandwich in PA!  The fries are hand cut and made to order!  If you come to see the Steelers, Pirates or Penguins you gotta stop by Market Square and experience Primanti Bros for yourself!"}
{"text":"I simply don't get why Primanti's is such a staple here. I'm sitting at the bar desperately trying to season my sandwich, keep it from falling apart, and keep my mouth from getting dry b/c of the desiccating combo of fries and french loaf. I guess it makes sense b/c Pittsburgh seems to be all about the blandest food, esp. pierogies. If you're in Oakland, go to Uncle Sam's around the corner instead"}
{"text":"Original Strip District location is my go-to choice. The others are OK. Strip is always the spot on no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"I'm never a fan of the suburban locations or most of the city locations to be honest. Original Strip location and Garfield are the best in my opinion.

With that said this location is a step above their other soccer mom spots. 

It's always packed but waiting for seating isn't awful. Also every single time I eat somewhere other than Strip or Garfield, the Mancini bread is stale. That's unacceptable! Never the case here. It's always fresh and soft as it should be.

The staff are young, friendly and a lot of fun.

This is a location where I'm always happy to return."}
{"text":"What can ya say about this local/regional now semi-national chain that's not been said before?

Sandwiches hit the spot each and every time. My goto? Cap & cheese with extra tomato and fries on the side."}
{"text":"Well here's our local chain's latest expansion. I love Primanti's and always have. I'm never a fan of the suburban restaurant version. I'm a Strip District girl through and through. With that said...I approve of this location. The layout isn't much different than when it was Prairie or Verde.
Bartenders and servers are super friendly and talkative.
Sandwich was good. Cheese combo with extra cheese and slaw on the side. The bread was fresh which is a huge deal because usually stale at locations like Market Square, Robinson and South Side.
Kudos to this one indeed."}
{"text":"I am a Pittsburgh native and never had a Primanti sandwich until a couple years ago. I go when I bring family and they want to try the famous sandwich. Even at the prime Market Square area the prices are very good. The concept is simple which I like, the bread is amazing and the service if friendly.

I got the steak and cheese - didn't really have that much steak - guess that's why its $6.99. My daughter got the traditional #2 Pittsburgher. I asked for no Cole slaw and my fries on the side. Got a funny look and remark from the waiter.

We went 2 days later after the steeler game and they ran out of wings. It reminds me of In n Out Burger on the west coast. Crazy loyal following with a good product that I don't mind eating at but I just don't find it as great as everyone else."}
{"text":"I had the famous Pitts-Burger and it was disgusting! The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the bread. The bread is super soft and tasty but the meat was gross and the cole slaw was bitter. I don't see what the hype is all about!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Pittsburgh I was told that Primanti Bros was THE spot to grab a bite. The food is quite good, but, honestly, I was expecting more. While I do enjoy the variety of sandwiches they offer, I, often times, find the slaw to be pretty bland. Not much flavor at all. That's really my only gripe. The portions are gracious, the price isn't bad either. So, I would recommend this place as a definite stop if you're looking for a taste of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We figured we'd go to PB because of the great reputation, but we weren't impressed. Super overrated and the service was subpar at best. The sandwiches lived up to being stuffed full of toppings, but the meat was lacking and everything tasted bland. We're glad we went, but wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"The definition of Pittsburgh. There is nothing quite like a Primanti's sandwich......served on wax paper (awesome) these monsters are piled high with toppings including coleslaw and fries. My favorite is the Capicola & Egg. Slap some Red Devil sauce on there and order up an Iron City and you are set for a fantastic meal. 

Probably not the most healthy but it will fill you up and make you happy. Born and raised in Pittsburgh but living in Southern California, I make a trip to Primanti's every time I am back in the Steel City!"}
{"text":"I was visiting family in the area and they said I had to try this place. They weren't kidding. It was a unique experience. I was surprised how great the service was. We were treated very well. We split a bologna and cheese and a pitts-burger. I loved the coleslaw on the sandwich and they had good coke. We didn't try any other sides because the sandwiches were so big. Yum."}
{"text":"I have eaten better sandwiches but stopping for lunch at Primanti Bros was an overall great experience. I sat inside at the bar where I was afforded a bird's eye view of the grill. You should expect to eat a sandwich with a handful of french fries and a handful of cole slaw smashed on top of whatever meat/cheese combination you may have ordered. I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar to take in the full experience."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to a comedy show.  We ordered the steak sandwich.  We had been drooling over this sandwich since the first time we saw an article written about it. I am happy to say this sandwich was everything we had expected! The sandwich was so big we had to share.   The slaw was better than I expected (I am very picky about my slaw) and the fresh cut fries made the sandwich perfect!"}
{"text":"This place was good and was what I was expecting for a Pittsburgh food staple. I had the burger sandwich which was the #2 best selling sandwich. The coleslaw was tangy and the fries tasted good. This particular location had primarily sandwiches and a full bar. The other main location has more of an extensive menu. Not a bad place to grab a sandwich for a not so expensive price to start off a night of bar hoping."}
{"text":"I was first excited that it's one of those places they review on the Food Network where they make specialty sandwiches, NYC style.
In reality, their food is not that great. Yes, the sandwiches are huge, come with fries inside, and a ton of meat, etc. But I've definitely had better.
I was disappointed that the salads are premade; the ones you'd buy at a super market or gas station. I mean it is a casual place, but I was at least expecting a fresh salad.
In short, if you're on Market Square and are hungry for inexpensive (considering some of the other options there) and mediocare quick meal, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I found the sandwich I ate at Primanti Bros to be quite tasty!  As others have mentioned, the signature toppings of cole slaw (which I normally loathe, but, in this case, loved!), french fries and cheese accompany any of your \"meat\" choices for a sandwich.  The menu is limited, and there are no frills or false pretenses here.  I would definitely eat here again!  I had the fish and cheese sandwich, and it was outstanding!  I can't give the place 5 stars, because it didn't completely wow me, and the others in my party were a little disappointed.  I think they may have just made bad choices for their \"meat\" (kielbasa and the Pittsburgher), but I doubt I could get them to try it again.  But hey for only a little over $6 per sandwich, can one really complain?  Delicious!  I'll go back without 'em.  ;)  Not a lot of tables, and not even sure it's air conditioned, so don't bring your fancy clothes or your roaming toddler.  ;)"}
{"text":"Kentucky Mule was one of the best drinks I've ever had. Great service. Hey all work very hard to keep the flow so even if the line seems long it will move quickly."}
{"text":"While Permanti Brothers may be a tradition in Pittsburgh, it is one that I will never pass on. The place had the feeling that grease permeates everything. The sandwiches are practically tasteless. The soggy fries stuffed inside give it bulk, but dull the flavor. The slaw inside was equally tasteless. By far the most memorable part of my Permanti Brothers visit was the trip to the filthy restroom. I'll consider myself lucky if I avoid an illness from the experience."}
{"text":"I love Primanti's! It doesn't matter whether it's noon or 4am, which it was for this visit to the flagship location.

What happens at 4am here? Not really much. Cops come in to get a sandwich. Some drunks are eating at the bar, but not as much action, as I thought there would be. Just good ole' sammiches topped with some of the most delicious fries you've ever tasted. Just add a touch of vinegar and you're golden. 

Moral of the story is, their sandwiches are delicious at any time of the day or night!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anybody says. I love Primanti's. My last dying wish may be a sammie from here. Haters wanna hate, riiiiight?

I usually go with the roast beef or kielbasa. I don't know what it was tonight, but the stars aligned and that kielbasa was grilled to perfection. Pile on the crispy fries, that sweet vinegary coleslaw AND cheese and I'm a happy lady.  It's honestly the only sandwich I don't feel weird about eating white bread. I think it's those thick cuts of Italian bread that seal the deal. 

The only complaint I have for this location is that it's smokey. The bar next door allows smoking, but it smells like stale smoke on the restaurant side. Also, it could be cleaned up maybe a little bit inside. I guess the \"dirty\" appearance gives it some charm?? I guess?? Whatever, I'll be the one sitting at a dirty table shoving the the sammie in my mouth..."}
{"text":"Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.  Pile on your choice of meat and cheese....then the grand finale....cole slaw and fries!  Then the put both hands on the sandwich and proceed to smoosh it all down flat. All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware! 

I don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique. 

If you're visiting Pittsburgh, go here?  If you're new to Pittsburgh, go here! If you just need your fill of a sandwich with more sides on it than you usually order in a regular sitting, go here!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I like sandwiches, fries, cole slaw and homemade bread.   I was so looking forward to trying Primanti.  I couldn't wait to see what all of the hype was about.   Why then don't I like Primanti?  I've tried a couple of versions  (pastrami, steak) and was completely uninspired.  The bread is blah, the cole slaw is nothing more that shredded cabbage and the meat is not what I would consider to be quality.  While the pastrami is certainly better than the steak (or what THEY call steak), I was not impressed.

IMO, the bread's the thing, and with Primanti, the bread is nothing more than what you get out of a supermarket.  A better sandwich would be made on a nice, crusty italian role, then doctor up that \"cole slaw\" with some vinegar, mayo or something to give it flavor, and use better quality meat and THEN you got a sandwich.  

A Philly cheese steak is a much better option."}
{"text":"this place lives up to its reputation. cole slaw and french fries on a sandwich? delicious! and for only around $6 for a giant sandwich, this is a really cheap meal. and it's a pittsburgh classic."}
{"text":"We accidentally went to a Primanti Bros that was closed (it was midnight) but our Uber Drive let us get back in and drove us to an open Primanti. The sandwiches were huge and yummy. The fries were full of all sorts of delicious unhealthy toppings."}
{"text":"REALLY great place with tons of history. A must-eat while in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"First time trying a Primanti Bros. sandwich and I was not disappointed. I came in after seeing the show featured on numerous television programs and through word of mouth. I wasn't sure what to order at first, but the employees were super nice and explained each sandwich and just what I'd get. I ended up with the pastrami and cheese with egg and fries and coleslaw and, wowie, it was just spectacular. It was a bit messy, but that's par for the course with these types of sandwiches. The price of a $7 plus sandwich seemed hi at first but made more sense after I could barely eat half. Could have been a by cleaner, but I'm reaching here. Go eat here at least once in your life."}
{"text":"Awesome beer and food. Visiting Pittsburgh and this was recommended. Definitely worth a stop.  Awesome food... wings killer... everything great."}
{"text":"Had to try this while in Pittsburgh. Ate the first half of my sandwich with the slaw & the fries but by the time I got to the second half I took the fries off because they were cold. I had the pastrami & asked for extra cheese. Didn't get the extra cheese. Feel like the sandwiches are missing something. Might be good with a thousand island dressing or \"secret sauce\". 

Underwhelmed but still recommend trying it at least once for the experience.

Market square location was confusing because seat yourself but wasn't clear."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh stable at its finest! The service was quick & thats about the most exciting this about it. My sandwich which was the Pittsburgh Cheese Steak. The meat was very dry, which made me wonder on how quick is was for us to get our food. I sampled other sandwiches that my family got & theirs were much better!! Capicola was on point! And so was the salami!"}
{"text":"I go to Point Park so this Primanti's is a staple for me and my friends. We go here probably 4 or 5 times a semester - always in groups of at least 4 and often more. The food is so great it's hard to care about anything else. I usually get the capicola with an egg, or pastrami with an egg. I have realized recently that the service is getting worse and worse (last time I went there I wasn't able to get a refill on my drink because our server never even came by our table after he served our food). Also, I was super upset that you were completely out of malt vinegar for my sandwich. Other than that, it's always great."}
{"text":"It was certainly a great experience eating at this restaurant.  Sandwich was good, but nothing to rave about. Very messy and hard to get a bit because of it's size.  One of those places you tried once because it's a well known place."}
{"text":"Want to stack the cards on getting a heart attack before any of your friends?? Get a meal here!!! ;) 

Fries, slaw, meat, cheese, dressing, giant rolls of bread... it all adds up to one amazingly yummy Primanti Bro's dinner! Its not nearly the only place in the country that does this kind of sandwich, but its the only one I know of in Pittsburgh that does... so go for it! :)"}
{"text":"Really not sure what all the hype and popularity of this place is all about. Sandwich was meh. Fries were meh. Tater tots were meh. But the dipping sauce for the tots were on point. That's about it.  There is very little meat on the sandwich. It's mostly bread and a huge clump of coleslaw. Came here because everyone says it's \"the place\" when in Pittsburgh. I'd pass....  Service isn't that great either."}
{"text":"The service was decent but my sandwich was terrible & had to be sent back twice without a decent apology. Once it was almost correct, the meat & bread were both cold. It was probably the worst lunch I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"maybe i just dont get it, but i was very unimpressed.  The sandwich came on bread that was a borderline joke, the meat was about as greasy as it could possibly have been.  The fries and coleslaw were good, but not anything special.  The overall concept intrigued me, but it didnt really deliver on any level.  I'd say check out one of their other locations, which seem to have better reviews, but I'm not quite sure it was worth the excessive hype."}
{"text":"A juicy burger with slaw, fries, and a fried egg. I don't order in this way anywhere else, nor do I care to do so. Other places simply cannot execute this meal with the skill and confidence of Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"I can't believe this was recommended to out-of-towners as a must eat. The floor was greasy enough to ice skate on; I seriously had to walk carefully to avoid slipping. The bathrooms were not clean. No local cider offerings at the bar. We ordered the cheesesteak and got a cheeseburger, which was a weirdly textured slab of meat. The wings were good and they get the one star, otherwise the service and atmosphere were severely lacking and I would not ever come back."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed by Primanti Bros. I was recommended the capicola sandwich, and ordered a side of chili cheese fries to go. The sandwich was odoriferous, as it was over 50% coleslaw. The pickled smell just ruins everything and washes out any other flavors. I ended up taking out all of the coleslaw, which made the sandwich more bearable. The bread was soggy from all of the greasy overcooked fries. There was also barely any capicola.

The chili cheese fries were terrible. The fries weren't even crisp, and they used cheap nacho cheese over the fries. The chili tasted as if it were from a soup can. I definitely expected better, especially from how much hype this establishment has received."}
{"text":"Double egg and cheese (plus fries & coleslaw squished between two fresh pieces of italian bread) with a Diet Coke. YESSSSS. 

Service was decent at this location. It seemed like they were understaffed, but our waitress was very sweet. Also, it was FREEZING. Like, tip of my nose was numb. I had to go outside after I was finished eating to thaw. 

Moral of the story: bring a sweater and don't drink your Diet Coke too fast or you'll be waiting for a refill."}
{"text":"Yum. The Primanti Cheesesteak.
Hamburger+Fries+Lettuce+Toms all on some white bread.
Delicious. Instant heartburn, instant gratification.

Don't come here for the decor. Don't bother putting your bra on.
Just order and eat up. Thank me later.
Don't bring your vegan friend."}
{"text":"Terrible staff! Walked out after guy seating patrons screamed at us twice for waiting by the door, literally asking us to get out of the restaurant. We were waiting near the sign which said wait to be seated. Too bad we were looking forward to having Pittsburgh's popular sandwich."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak with extra cheese. The soft bread turned to mush as it was damp. The cheese steak was overwhelmed by the large amount of cole slaw on the sandwich, making it taste more like a cole slaw sandwich than a cheese steak. 

Based on the description of the sandwich you would wonder why I gave this restaurant even three stars. This is because of the classic local restaurant atmosphere and a great atmosphere can make sub-par food taste so much better."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros. is our guilty pleasure.  We are regulars at the South Side spot.  Great prices, really cordial (and patient) staff, and the pride of Yinzerdom: Meat, egg, fries, cheese, slaw, and tomato served on a piece of wax paper.  My personal favorite is chicken breast, bacon and egg.  My wife always gets odd looks with sardine and egg, extra crispy fries on the side."}
{"text":"My husband and I just arrived in town. I am originally from the area. My first thought was to get a Primanti Sandwich, of course! We walked directly to this location from our hotel right after checking in. Upon arriving, hostess asked us if we would like to sit at the bar. We thought it might be fun to watch them make the sandwiches. There were random seats, one in an area that we thought would block the servers from picking up drinks. My husband asked a male (maybe in his late 20's, medium build, darker hair with a beard) standing behind the area if we would be in anyone's way sitting there. Easy question, right? His reply to my husband in a very condescending tone, \" if you sit at the bar, you are sitting at the bar. If you sit at a table, you are sitting at a table.\" Then walked away!!! After recovering from complete shock as to how rude he had been, we immediately left. We walked directly across the square to Diamond Market where we had great service, great food and got to sit outside enjoying the square. Here is the saddest part, my husband owns 10 \"RESTAURANTS \" in Florida. He employs over 600 people! I was the one that asked him if we could go to Primanti's only for him to be treated like crap by some young condescending punk! I have lots of friends and family here and I will certainly be sharing this info. My advice: avoid this location! We obviously will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"I know this place is famous, but I can't think of why.  I ate there for the first and last time last night.  Fried pickles - greasey and spicy.  Fried artichokes - greasy and flavorless.  And the steak sandwich.  Literally swimming in grease, boring Wonderbread, fries that tasted like they had dirt on them, and I couldn't taste the meat at all.  I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would eat here.  And I'm not that hard to please."}
{"text":"I am glad to have experienced an iconic sandwich, while getting my HRC shot glass in the city of Steel.  Starting with the bread, it is soft and really complements the meat, the slaw and fries packed inside.  The place was like the \"Cheers\" bar and many local patrons were watching the Pirates losing on TV (lol).   There are multiple locations but I went to this one.  Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend the restaurant if anyone is visiting Pittsburgh and wants a quick bite."}
{"text":"Came here because NOTHING else is open in Pittsburgh after the bars close. I'm a vegetarian, and the options available are slim to none. Got the double egg and cheese, and it was bland - absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Came here with friends who ordered the \"Ragin' Cajun\" and pastrami. They weren't impressed either. Both friends disliked the large pieces of bread. I agreed with them on the entire lack of flavor. 

I don't know why people recommend this place, but they need to stop. This place is not good and not worth coming to. If they'd like to improve, add some FLAVOR to the sandwiches! Consider garlic, onion, spices, mayo, salt....these things are important in enhancing food.

Would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches. .I am from los Angeles and we have nothing like it..the staff and food were perfect"}
{"text":"This establishment choose to treat me like scum. They choose to yell and direct me toward the exit even though it was 1:30 am and the posted closing time was 2am, I can understand closing early but hey I'm not from here and heard I should try it out. This will be one spot I will NEVER come to due to service. I only wish I would have gotten the servers name prior to being rudely spoken to, thus forcing me out of the establishment. There are better ways to tell paying customers that you are closed."}
{"text":"We ordered the Thursday Family Special.  The salad was good with plenty of dressing.  The pizza was soggy. They must have run out of mozzarella cheese because it seemed to only have parmesan on it.  We have had pizzas at Primanti's before and this was the worst."}
{"text":"Tiny little place and very popular...highly suggest going early if you're a newbie in town and never had their sammiches before. They get pretty busy after 12.

I couldn't decide what to get, and was told their number 2 popular choice is  not that great and I should try salami or black angus. Tough! So, I ended going with roast beef. I really enjoyed it, not greasy at all, and I actually ate the whole thing. Ha unbelievable, it was that good! 

Overall service was great."}
{"text":"I'm giving it five stars because it is a classic. They haven't let the fame change them. Having said that - don't go there looking for anything but what it is - big food and lots of it - you can get the half sandwich without fries but if your there you need to be all in. I took that attitude and actually ate it all - unusual - you need to do it!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price. It feels like getting a sandwich at home, but it's way better. Most importantly, the meat is delicious. Not for the faint of heart, but these sandwiches are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal.

Phenomenal sandwich. Phenomenal fries (inside & out the sandwich). Phenomenal atmosphere.

Please open a chain here in San Diego!
SO good!! 

I had a pastrami and cheese I split with a friend/coworker and my other coworker ordered a cappicolli or something spicy Italian sub that was 1.huge and 2. Delicious. And we ordered cheese fries to split- absolutely fantastic.

It was so perfect, I swear I wish they'd have one back home. And all with a sassy sweet bartender, sure why not?!"}
{"text":"Busy place and ended up in bar area and the noise level was a bit high. The food and service are good"}
{"text":"Great burgers. French fries are crispy and our in the sandwich. They also have use lettuce and tomato. I personally recommend getting the kapicola and egg"}
{"text":"OK, so my bf and I go intending to split a cheese steak sandwich once we see the size of it  but had no idea there would be french fries in it (sucks to be allergic to potatoes!) so had to order one for each of us. The bread is exactly how I like to eat white bread (since it's such a rarity for me) fresh, soft with chewy crust mmmm. And who knew that a sammie would taste so delish with coleslaw it in? Well worth trying for $6.95 but easily shared if you're not starving but just want to try something new."}
{"text":"It's a Primanti's so pretty much exactly what you would expect. A Pittsburgh classic where sandwiches are piled high with cole slaw and fries. It's pitched as one of those \"must trys\", but the novelty of slaw and fries wears off after the first few bites and you're left with a very meh sandwich. 

This particular location is constantly filled with Pitt students, and service here is very slow. We waited an hour for a few sandwiches. The best part of the meal was the tater tots, which were nice and crispy and piping hot!

I would come here only if you're working on a Pittsburgh bucket list. If I find my way back, I'll skip the sandwich in favor of some top notch tots."}
{"text":"Run don't walk for their famous huge sandwiches with fries and slaw on soft Italian bread. Order the cap, cap and egg, or sausage."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Location was clean.  Service was poor.  Given a choice, I would save my annual Primanti experience for the locations in downtown.  That being said, this is a great alternative to the Burger King Down the road..."}
{"text":"I was there two days ago  I had a rueben sandwich  the sandwich came with French fries steak cheese sauerkraut and it is one of my most enjoyed sandwich although there are many more to enjoy always be a customer favorite"}
{"text":"The girlfriend, J, was in a Pittsburgh wedding. I agreed to go along for the sole purpose of going to Primanti Brothers for one of their sandwiches. I always thought that people made fun of major cities like Pittsburgh because their favorite sports team was beaten by the Steelers, Penguins or Pirates. By my fourth say in Pittsburgh I realized sports had nothing to do with the mockery. Pittsburgh will always hold the record for the highest concentration of people asking me, \"Holy sh*t! You're from LA? Ever see any movie stars?\" 

So yeah, by the 4th day Primanti Brothers had a huge burden on its proverbial shoulders in order to change my opinion of Iron City. We arrived at the original location about noon on a spring Sunday. When we walked in there were a lot of empty tables with food on them. J and I weren't sure where to go or what to do so we just stood there by the door with that newbie stare. A waitress finally talked to us realizing we needed some guidance. I believe her gravely smokers voice told us to \"sit anywhere.\" As we walked to the least offensive looking table I noticed that J and I were the only people not wearing a Troy Polamalu Steelers jersey. Being a lifelong Trojan fan I had to laugh because even though I was from out of town I had been a Polamalu fan at least four years longer than even the most die hard fan in this place. BTW, the second most popular question I was asked that weekend was, \"You're a USC fan? Did you know Troy Polamalu went to USC?\" 

The sandwiches were good but I definitely had my expectations set way too high. If I had been out drinking and just wanted to bury my face in a messy sandwich that allowed me to taste everything in one bite, including what most people consider sides, then Primanti Brothers would be the answer. If you have ever heard Patton Oswalt's routine on the KFC Famous Bowl you can relates to the Primanti Brothers sandwich experience. 

But here's the proof in the pudding; would I come back? Abso-freakin-lutely! This place is good as long as you know what you are getting yourself into. It's fun to be messy sometimes and for a guy like me, all I have to do is mention Polamalu or Lynn Swann and I know I'll be welcome."}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich didn't disappoint!   After hearing so much about this iconic spot, I had to stop in and see what was going on!  Well worth the visit if you're in Pittsburgh.  Great to eat at a non-chain restaurant with such rich history and quality food!  Bread.....awesome!!"}
{"text":"MEMO:DEAR WHITE PEOPLE,Yesterday Downtown market Square just wanted to stop and have a quick drink , against my better judgment, I decided on Primantis, in my experience every time I go to this restaurant there always seem to be a problem with The way I'm treated, assumingely because I'm an African-American, I always get rude looks unprofessional,waiters ,waitresses ,they are very rude it's as if they don't want Black people to patronize their business, in my opinion this is just another form of subtle racism, we will take your money and we will let you know that we don't prefer that you patronize our Business, by the way we treat you,why don't They just put a big sign out there no BLACKS allowed, it would be much better to just be frank about it ,that way we would know not to do business with Primantis...."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like this Pittsburgh establishment!? I took my sister there when she visited from out of town, and she loved it. She's a picky eater, so I was worried she might not like the slaw and fries on the sandwich, but she loved it. Their slaw is my son's fave, and I was able to go home with a tub for his graduation party - and at a very reasonable price. We visited on the day that Corbett and Christie were in town, so there was a small group of protesters outside the door. That certainly made things interesting, and instead of the politicians coming in to see everyone, they were brought in from some side door, and we never got to see them. Oh, well. The food is what we were there for, anyway. And it's always good."}
{"text":"It's Primanti's. Who in Pittsburgh doesn't know this joint? 

You know the cliché: fries come on he sandwich, big portions, and it puts hair on your chest. 

The only slightly interesting thing I can say is that this location is actually my favorite. Purists will say the Strip or South Side but this is definitely a contender for best Primantis (also don't be fooled by the standalone chains or stadium varieties if that's all you know, these are the 'real' locations). 

Best combo: bacon egg and cheese with an IC Light. Seriously best thing possible. 

Outdoor seating with a lot of TVs. The only downside is limited seating but what Primanti's doesn't have limited seating? 

Go, eat, regret your gluttony, have a beer, repeat."}
{"text":"I've been in Pittsburgh for 3 days and I have eaten primanti brothers everyday. I'm about to go again now for breakfast. When people tell you you have to eat here when you come to Pittsburgh they are CORRECT.

Only complaint I have was the \"pittsburger\" sandwich... that hamburger patty is not good. It's pretty gross. I don't know how it's a best seller. Acquired taste maybe. BUT the roast beef, hot sausage, kielbasa.... TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"No trip to Pittsburgh is complete without a visit to Primanti Brothers.  We usually visit the South Hills location which is close to our friend's house but on this beautiful spring Saturday, we thought it would be fun to go downtown and hit the Strip District.  

This is the original location so it's a bit more touristy than the others.  The menu is more limited, no pizza or anything like that, and they only accept CASH so be prepared for that.  For me, there seems to be a general urgency to turn the tables as fast as possible, something I don't see in the other locations.  If you're looking to hang out for a while this probably isn't your stop.  It's kind of ironic that this original location with it's history of developing the all-in-1 sandwich for the local workers now serves more tourists and weekend visitors to the Strip District than anything else.

So, all that said, why 5 stars.  Well, for several reasons.  1. It's Primanti's so the sandwiches are simply amazing, I can't come to Pittsburgh without one, they're that good. The meat, the bread, the slaw, it's all good.  2. The history of the location trumps the transition.  You can meet Toni, the worker that's been there forever and is featured on Man vs. Food.  And it's in such a cool spot, in the Strip District. 3. It's part of the Pittsburgh experience, at least it is for us.

Prices run about $10 per person for a sandwich and a drink, not a bad deal for the massive sandwich.  And don't even think about splitting one, trust me, you can eat the whole thing!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon and say down right away, plus! But our waitress didn't really seem to know anything about the menu. The bread on the sandwiches is so soft and tasty, the meat was also good, but the fries didn't seem fried long enough and the coleslaw was missing some salt and pepper. Glad we went but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Eating Primanti Brothers food is like taking tranquilizers while listening to elevator music in a beige room.  Boring, unhealthy, and coma inducing.  

It is horrifying that Primanti Bros is some of the burghs best known food, and what most out of towners associate with our cities culinary stylings.  Don't get me wrong, we love our potatoes, fried, baked, hashed, mashed, or in pierogies, but Primanti Bros is the worst example of Pittsburgh staples.

The people watching is entertaining (especially when the bars let out at 2AM) and the Pittsburgh focused murals painted on the wall are fun. Primanti Bros signature sandwich has fries and coleslaw on it.  I'm all for fries and coleslaw on a sandwich.  In fact, take any side dish you want and throw it on a sandwich, but the combination will only be as good as the ingredients you start out with.  

Primanti Bros fries and coleslaw are soggy, bland, and lack any flavor, crispy crunch, or lightness.  Their sandwiches are heavy, boring, and put me to sleep, and are the lowest form of Pittsburgh fare."}
{"text":"I've tried it twice now because if you ever mention you're going to Pittsburgh the first thing you hear is \"Oh Man, you HAVE to go to Primanti's\".  Sorry, I guess it's just not my thing.  It's not horrible once I take off all the french fries they pile up, but it's definitely not my thing."}
{"text":"Solid not great. If you're in need of a good sandwich with fixings that are towering, this is the place for you. Sandwiches of many varieties that are topped with slaw, fries, and tomatoes on thick slices of bread...there goes the diet. Lol"}
{"text":"Visited this Primanti Bros. Last Saturday night when I came to town for a Steelers game.  Had never been here before and tried the steak sandwhich.  It was not that good for the #2 sandwich in town (I'm assuming). I was told by a cousin who has lived in town for 5 years that it was overrated and found this to be true with the quality of food.  

On a positive note the staff was amazing and so was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like Primanti's, don't get me wrong - but the fries could be cooked more and the coleslaw could be more flavorful. I might be a slaw zealot - I really like the stuff. But just because you're putting the slaw on the sandwich doesn't mean it shouldn't be good on its own.

Upsides: atmosphere, the bread's great, the meat is good, and it's not pricey."}
{"text":"Enjoy the Pittsburgh Experience without the Downtown Traffic.  This location is near the PA Turnpike in Monroeville.  Food & Service was out of this world.  I can't wait to go back & bring my friends.  

I recommend the Angus Steak Sandwich with fries."}
{"text":"We had been warned about cranky customer service, but we encountered none of that. All friendly faces. On a Wednesday morning at 11 there was a lunch crowd streaming in, but no wait at all, and our waitress was nice as can be. She yelled at the TV a couple of times, which made me feel instantly akin. 

So, as I have lived in three cities with famous foodstuffs, I am naturally prone to raising a skeptical eyebrow, to beware of claims of the second-coming in sandwich form. And besides that, to put it plain, I didn't like the looks of the bread. Appeared  to be a thick width-cut of soft Italian bread. While fresh, the bread slices were just as I had figured. 

Those slices had all the power of Wonder Bread when it came to holding that sandwich together. Come on bread, where's ya integrity? Where's ya pride?! The sandwich fries, though hand-cut-looking, were unseasoned and mostly flabby. I'm tellin you, if the fries were fried to crispy salty perfection, I'd be singin a lot different tune here... a tune that might go something like, \"Ooooh you're bread's too soft, but everything else is awright...\" or something like that. I'm not really a song-writer. 

The coleslaw didn't offend me! The pastrami was the best part of the whole t'do. My travelin' pal had the sandwich with \"kolbassi,\" and he agreed that the meatsy was the highlight of the sandwich too. 

So, I just wanted to taste for myself. Good to know that Primanti Brothers is open 24 hours. While I don't ever see me on a line stretched round the back, I can see the appeal at 3:07 AM or some such situation."}
{"text":"Love it. great place for kids and adults alike. One of the few restaurants I crave when I travel abroad..."}
{"text":"Fridays are good for happy hour and food is good too. It can be busy so be prepared to wait for a table once in a while. Or just sit on the back deck."}
{"text":"I, personally, do not understand why everyone from Pittsburgh raves about Primanti sandwiches. As someone from Pittsburgh, I don't particularly think they are better sandwiches than average, but most Pittsburghers say that it's a staple. Most people go for the experience of saying that they've been to Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"If you visit Pittsburgh Primantis is a must stop place. The boast a unique sandwich with your choice of meat, fresh cut French fries and coleslaw on fresh, soft Italian bread. My favorite is the roast beef!"}
{"text":"Primantis has there reputation and if you've been there before you know what you're going to get. A classic Pittsburgh sandwich. This particular location was pretty good!"}
{"text":"ate at the one in North Versailles. floor filty, all young kids running the place, poor service, poorly made sandwich, very bad overall. The should have a manager on duty. I wont be back. thanks"}
{"text":"My slogan for Primanti Brothers? Most efficient sandwich in the U.S.!  Everything you could want in a meal is piled generously onto this sandwich. Layers of French fries, coleslaw, salami (or your choice of meat), and cheese are heaped on and will inevitably lead to a food coma. 

Love this place! It's so authentically Pittsburgh with a great bar atmosphere, excellent food, a plethora of televisions with sports galore, and an endless stream of beer. God I came here my first time in Pitt and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was a recommendation by our Lyft driver. We had no idea how good it was going to be. We split the sandwich and it was too much for the both of us. We also had the loaded tots which were amazing and I could have stuffed my face with them all day long but my belly just couldn't handle any more. 

Super friendly and efficient staff. They know how to work a lunch crowd. One staff in particular stood out. She was this guy's angel. 

A little old man walked in. He was maybe 5 feet tall. He had a box. He opened the box and looked at her and said can you help me. She said sure. He asked where he would go to find out if he was a winner. Long story short he was holding a small cardboard box with his hearing aid batteries in it. He kept asking if they were winners or where he could go to see if they were winners. No-one could really figure out what he wanted. She asked him to hold on and she gave him a bottled water which he sucked down quickly. She then gave him another water and a vat of fries. He didn't eat the fries but she kept him occupied long enough for the police/paramedics to come. They were kind to him and they ended up loading him into the ambulance to check him over. HE said he felt ok but his sugars may have been a bit off or he just got a little confused on the way here. He had taken the bus in town. He gave the police his address and his emergency number. His nephew did not answer. They called his high-rise apartment and LM for them. 

This place was great for their food. But to watch this unfold in front of us and see how the staff handled it!? This place would be a got to of mine for sure. Stellar staff with really good food!"}
{"text":"Fairly bland sandwich, very weak drinks. They no longer sell their famous Pittsburgher with roast beef, ham and turkey that made them famous. I had to order that special. And I ordered a rum drink. It had no rum in it at all that I could tell. I tasted no rum in it so I assume that it had none. I asked the waitress about it and she told me that Primanti's is not known for their mixed drinks but it is for their sandwiches and beer. Maybe that's why. It was an expensive fruit drink.  The service though was superb."}
{"text":"After a couple restaurant iterations at this location, Primanti's is an ideal fit for the space and surrounding 'hoods. The diverse crowd and continual take-out orders are healthy signs for longevity if you aren't already a convert to their \"Almost Famous\" sammies that helped put da 'burgh on the map. At happy hour with your large half-off beer, you'll be lucky to get two sips in before the larger than life sandwich appears...even before the appetizers! The service is quick and can be overly attentive depending on the server. Not a bad \"problem\" to have, really. For a bite filled with your choice o' meat, fresh cut fries, sweet 'n sour slaw, cheese + tomato you're going to have to mash down the Italian bread (and/or cut it in half), but it will be so worth it. FWIW, their pizza is actually quite good, but their wings are on the smallish side and sometimes not the greatest quality...oh and my kid is partial to their hamburger. For the real deal hunters, late night is where it's at. All the aforementioned n'at for $5 at 5 after 10:00 (time & grub vary by location). You can't tap into your inner yinzer more than breakin' bread at your local James Beard award-winning Primanti Bruthas! 4-1-2 stand up!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and heard this was the place to go. It had been on the food network and all the reviews said it's Pittsburgh's staple food. I have to say I was not impressed. My husband got their best seller (the burger) and I got our servers favorite (spicy Italian) we also got their signature drink and fried pickles that were recommended to us by a couple waiting with us to be seated. Service was great but the food didn't have much flavor. The signature drink, the drunk duck, was very sweet although we kind of expected that. The French fries were very good but overall was just not very impressed. Maybe my expectations were set too high. Also wish they had bread options. All the sandwiches come on white French bread and I really do not enjoy white bread.."}
{"text":"It's the original. The other locations would get four stars. #2 best seller (cheesesteak) + #1 best seller (beer) = awesome. Open 24 hours and cash only. Bring your broomstick because the sandwiches are awesome."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped as we were driving through. Seated immediately, and our waitress was super friendly. We both ordered the New Yorker and they came out quickly. It's a massive, massive sandwich but delicious. Neither of us were able to finish even half, but we left full and happy."}
{"text":"Went here Twice with my grandfather before he passed away years ago, I must say that I like the sandwiches and the combination with the fries and coleslaw is amazing. I need to come back here at some point it's been years since I've been here but it's always crowded."}
{"text":"Just visiting from Seattle WA. Tried the chili with bread and butter then had to get a sandwich to-go it was all sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Ordered an Oktoberfest, it came out and was obviously not an Oktoberfest but a Summer Ale. The waitress said the bartender told her the tap was changed today and would be lighter than normal, which makes no sense. The acting manager came by and I asked about it again and was told the manager had been drinking it all day so it was obviously right. Slightly annoyed at this point, received my food which turned out pretty good (honey buffalo wings) but had to ask for my side, sauce and silverware. The waitress seemed steadily more annoyed and didn't refill drinks or return to the table until she was requested through the manager."}
{"text":"Don't see what all the fuss is about...can't really say much about Primanti's except that when it comes to sloppy drunk food, I've had better."}
{"text":"I was with a local Pittsburgh friend and he indicated eating here is a must-do if you really want to experience the area like a local. Apparently, this is the place to go to for the sandwiches that include french fries in between the buns so to speak, which is the Pittsburgh way. 

The friend warned me that there might not be anything for a vegetarian like me, but I'm glad he was incorrect! They had me covered with several options! 

Their famous sandwich is called the Almost Famous Sandwich which has a unilateral base of french fries, coleslaw, tomatoes, and of course bread. The base serves as a jumping off point to a wide variety of options that include your heavy meat choices or the simply cheese combo option (Provolone, American, Swiss) that I selected. These options range from around $5.99-8.99 which is quite reasonable. The sandwich was actually quite delicious and the unique mixture was a nice surprise to the expectation of a conventional sandwich. I really like that you can choose your options - something for everyone!  

It's worthy to note that their coleslaw is a vinegar based style, not that heavy mayo doused rendition that you find more in the south. This is important because it helps in not making your sandwich a gut bomb that sticks with you well into the next day. They also have salads which as a vegetarian are always appreciated. 

The ambiance is a sports bar type place but in a more welcoming way than normal. It's worth your time to check out and get a feel for how Pittsburgh folks spend their time."}
{"text":"Many of the locals told us that we HAVE to try this place. After hearing all of the raves, we were sure that we were going to have a great meal. Wow! Just wow! I don't mean that in a good way either. Very disappointing! We ordered a sandwich the Primanti way with the coleslaw on top. Gross! I tried it again after scraping off the coleslaw. It still didn't taste any better. We also ordered a slice of pizza since you really can't go wrong with that. Not good! Tostino's frozen pizza tastes better than that. None of the food was good. We both actually got sick that night from the food. The only plus side was the service and bar area."}
{"text":"The restaurant did their level best to make it up to me, so here's another star for giving a damn. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on one of those food shows that tells you the best places to eat and knew I had to try it. I really liked the ambiance.  All of the employees worked really well together to take care of the patrons and my sandwich was delectable. It was loaded with French fries,  tomato,  and cole slaw. I'm not a huge cole slaw fan but theirs was really good.  It was more tangy and not just a big sloppy pile of mayo and cabbage. It's a must if you are in the Pittsburgh area,  for sure."}
{"text":"OK...let me preface this by saying I too was swayed by Adam swooning over a sandwich on Man Vs. Food...I think he nearly passed out from pleasure. 
So, when my family and I found ourselves in downtown Pittsburgh, hungry as heck, passing this famous restaurant, I said \"OMG, there's that place with the fries on the sandwich!!\"  Wifey said 'why not' and son/man-child mumbled something incoherent about 'hungry'.
We were seated quickly (large wood booth...we aren't the slimmest family), since the place was mostly empty.  No menu? OHHH...it's one of those places where you just look up on the chalkboard. COOL!!
I had the Cheesesteak, wifey had the roast beef something or other, and my son/man-child had the kid's cheeseburger. Cokes all around.  No need to order sides of fries or coleslaw, CUZ IT COMES ON THE SANDWICH!! How cool is that?  I regaled my family with my knowledge... \"they created this sandwich so truckers could eat the thing with one hand...\"  Wifey rolled her eyes and returned to her texting, and son/man-child kept playing his Nintendo 3DS.  Hmmm...maybe I'll keep my knowledge to myself for a while.  Looked around: Cool paintings/graphics on the walls, sports icons from SteelTown, USA, etc... Long counter with your typical customers doing typical things..
Food arrives in about 15 minutes...Not bad...ready to chow down!!! Smells great!!!
And...
Umm... 
a bunch of coleslaw slid out of my sandwich into my lap.  Wifey complained her fries were soggy as h*ll. \"should I send it back? are they supposed to soak up the coleslaw liquid?\"  ManChild ate his cheeseburger in about 3 bites and looked at me in anger, with that \"I told you I wanted to go to Taco Bell\" accusatory stare...

What can I say?  I was duped.  The sandwiches are flavorless... the fries, had they been crispy, would have been good, but they soak up the coleslaw liquid...so they are mushy.  Coleslaw has a TON of vineger, so if you don't like that style (I prefer the mayo-based) you probably won't like it.  Interesting concept, but I have no idea why this is Pittsburgh's famous sandwich.

Too bad... Adam steered me right in Philly for a cheesesteak, and in Chicago for pizza, and Detroit for a coney dog, but this was a big miss. Pittsburgh needs a new 'must have.'

Side note: I was not allowed to choose restaurants the rest of the trip.  Thanks Adam!!  :-P"}
{"text":"Perhaps my taste buds have died.  Or perhaps it's mass hysteria that is causing everyone to rave about these \"almost famous\" sandwiches.  Because yet again, I visit a TV featured restaurant only to find I have been suckered in by the hype.

We visited Primanti Bros. Monroeville a few days ago for dinner while we were passing through PA.  The waitress was very nice.  No problems there.  I ordered some chicken wings.   Crispy on the outside with a good sauce.  They were good.  (Except for the one that was ice cold inside!)

I ordered the Cappicola & Cheese.  I waited and hoped.  And....I was disappointed.  It was a sandwich.  An average sandwich with little flavor or excitement.  The \"slaw\" is shredded cabbage soaked in vinegar.  Maybe there's a touch of sugar in it as well.  But it's unremarkable.

I was so bored with the sandwich that I didn't even bother to finish about 1/3 of it.  It was that unexciting, that unappealing.

My husband had the black angus sandwich, and it was average, too.  There is nothing to write home about, and nothing to be excited about.  Maybe the original restaurant is where all the good food is, because I've had better sandwiches at my local, no frills, diner."}
{"text":"I brought 80 high school kids to this location on a SATURDAY, and I was floored at how prepared they were for us. Large ensemble directors, this is your place. The organization was impeccable, and I just can't thank Hagen, Sean, and their talented team for giving us such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Okay. I get it. People like soggy, greasy fries on their sandwiches. Also tasteless \"coleslaw\". Nope. Just no. I've tried 3 locations and have been disappointed for different reasons. Once I found I didn't care for all the extras on my burger/sandwiches I specified such. 2 out of 3 times I got the whole schmear anyway. Ok. Scrape it all off... But nowhere on the plate to put it all. Ugh. Once I got  to the meat, I found it dry and bland. The sandwiches literally had only 3 slices of meat! Pastrami, capicola or salami sandwiches were very sparse on the meat. Plus there's no Italian hoagie! Nope! Really!? No pizza by the slice. 
I expected more than glorified bar food."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and I don't think I could ever get bored of their sandwiches.  Everything was reasonably-priced, and the sandwiches were gigantic and delicious.

I've never had a wait here, nor have I ever had bad service.  I remember they had a fair selection of beers as well.

Look, you're not going to Primanti's for five-star filet mignon, posh decorations and furnishing and waiters in black ties and suits.

You're going to Primanti's for a big manly sandwich that gets right to the chase.  Easy in, easy out...your taste buds will be delighted...and you'll leave with a full belly.

That's what you're getting here."}
{"text":"Well I had high expectations being from out of town, but it fell short of the mark (way short).  The bread was really fresh, but the ingredients were not great.  Just very average. I'd pass on trying it again.

I tried the cheese steak sandwich and also the Pastrami"}
{"text":"half a sandwich was plenty for one person... it's pretty much a balanced meal in one - dairy, bread, meat, veggies, and sugar. what else is needed? a napkin definitely along with a drink. 
for those that don't know... it's pretty much the same for everyone but different insides. so just pick your innards and watch them put it together, lastly enjoy."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try a Primantis sandwich ever since I seen it on Man v Food. Went to Pittsburgh for a weekend trip to the zoo and aquarium so we had to stop!  Had a ragin' cajun chicken sandwich. It was great! Normally I hate coleslaw but this was something different. Not your normal mayonnaise-y coleslaw, it was oil and vinegar. It was fabulous. Fries were crispy and sandwich was cooked well. :) When I go back to Pittsburgh this will be on my list of places to stop."}
{"text":"Dude! These are huge. I was skeptical at first these would taste any good, but they did. I still tell people about this sandwich.

The drinks are strong and super cheap. 

I'm in love..."}
{"text":"you've never been to Pittsburgh if yunz havent ate here! it's a  Pittsburgh landmark....the fries the best, a sandwich with coleslaw, phenomenal!!!! p.s vinegar and fries!!! try it!!!"}
{"text":"I knew I had to make a stop at Primanti Bros a priority when I visited Pittsburgh last August! This review is a bit after the fact, but anyway... I had heard so much about their sandwiches and was really excited to try them. The Market Square location is really nice and there's plenty of outdoor seating with pretty city scenery and people watching opportunities. My dad and I chose the Market Square location instead of the original because we were in town to catch a Cubs/Pirates game and this one was within walking distance of our hotel near PNC Park. There's also a stand within PNC Park, but we wanted to get the full experience of one of the standalone restaurants.

I ordered the Turkey and Cheese sandwich and thought it was pretty good. I guess I was expecting a little bit more from it. By more I guess I mean more flavor. Don't get me wrong, it was a great and filling sandwich, but next time I would probably ask for some kind of sauce on it or something. All of the sandwiches are topped with fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes and I wanted to try the classic without any add-ons. I like a good vinegar-y coleslaw with a lot of bite, and this was crunchy but didn't have a ton of flavor.

My dad got medium wings and they were good and spicy. Being from Rochester, we take our wings seriously and these stood up really well to the wings we're used to. Nice and crispy with a good amount of heat and flavor.

I really enjoyed my visit to Primanti Bros and will be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh. I think the Pitts-Burger is next on my list to try."}
{"text":"Hot Pastrami + cheese + tomatoes + onion + cole slaw + french fries on thick crusty bread = One TallBadAssGreasyMuthaFukinGood Sandwich... :D"}
{"text":"I've noticed that many, if not all, of the negative reviews here are from foreigners (would you really trust their opinions on what a great American sandwich is?), tourists whining about bad service/ambience, and the refined palates out there lol. Listen, it's a sandwich shop. A greasy one. If you wanted some gourmet experience, you could've gone down to the Capital Grill. This is a gritty little eatery in a gritty city, so appreciate it for what it is and its historical significance. And for Christ's sake, give the people that work here a break. It's hot in there and they're hustlin for you. They don't care about your beaming smiling touristy faces and your cameras and how you can't wait to try what you saw on some TV show.

Back to the food...so far I've had the capicola and the pastrami. Capicola is sliced on the thick side (I'm more of a fan of the thin sliced Italian style that I'm used to in NJ/NY) so I'm partial to the pastrami. Double meat this bitch up. It's top notch. The cole slaw is fantastic, vinegar not mayo, adds the perfect crunchy bite. Fries are not crispy, but they're great on the sandwich itself. The bread is just ok, it's holding all the good stuff together. 

Somehow when you put everything together, something magical happens. It's def worth a try. Avoid the lunch crowds. Open 24/7. Bring cash and leave your \"I'm the customer and I demand stellar service\" attitude at home."}
{"text":"Oh man...how do a reviw a place that does something very unique, yet is somewhat gross, yet, tasty, but original.
I ventured over to the burgh fo a few days and everyone mentioned this place to me, but when hanging out with them, they wanted to go somewhere else to eat...so, the last day, i ventured over here solo and got a dose of one mega sandwich.

The rustic, diner like environment gave me a taste of what to expect, but man was i wrong.
Upon ordering the waiters quickly sid, whadaya want!
I went with the pastromi and she quicly threw a few slabs on the grill, topped with cheese. As she prepped that one, I saw the finishing touches of some other orders.
OH MY GOSH ThoSE ARE HUGE.

2 thick slices of bread, greasy meat with cheese though tasty...then samshed on top were thick layers of french fried and a nice does of cole slaw!!
this monster was probably 6-7 inches tall.....Many newbies remarked, how are we suppose to eat this, and they just said \"smash it down and enjoy\"

I'd love to give this place a 5 for uniqueness, but it is not something I'd go to everyday, nor even weekely. It's more of a \"damn, you have to give it a try\" place.
Throw some hot sauce of an egg to give it a good mix of flavor.

I give it a 3 mainly cause my style of food is the type I can eat a few times a week. 
This place is great, but after the first time, your like, uhggg, i feel ill, but love it."}
{"text":"Had to go because everyone said I did.  It was OK.  It's shtick is putting the fries and cole slaw on the sandwich.  That's a great idea if the underlying sandwich itself...meat, bread, some unique dressing, was itself awesome.  But the underlying sandwich was OK...nothing to get excited about.  So putting the cole slaw and fries on the sandwich just made eating it more messy.  If you are a tourist, you'll probably want to go because your supposed to.  But from what I've seen walking \"the strip\", there's got to be better food you can eat.  The price was good in any event."}
{"text":"Great food and very filling. Definitely need to walk this meal off when finished. Turkey and cheese was delicious. Fish sandwich was ok, not exceptional."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by Primanti brothers after hearing all the hype from everyone. We were already primed with the fact that their sandwiches are stuffed with fries so we decided to just share one sandwich. And holy moley was it colossal (well we DID get the colossal fish and cheese). We ended up taking most of the fries out because it got too heavy and filling. The coleslaw in the sandwich was pretty good-- not a huge amount of mayo which is what I like. However, even finishing half the sandwich was a huge battle for me. Toward the end, it wasn't pleasant at all because it was just way too filling."}
{"text":"Not the best. 
I've been here three times and it's been inconsistent. 
The sandwiches will come out on a piece of wax paper so it's pretty simple. They really overload the sandwiches with coleslaw and french fries. I end up picking half of my sandwich apart.
I brought my family here thinking it would be a good \"Pittsburgh sandwich shop.\" My family got the Pittsburgher sandwich, which is supposed to be their #2 seller, and all of them said it tasted terrible. It looked pretty awful like a hard, dry, high school cafeteria lunch. 
Some waiters are great, others will completely forget about you. 
Prices are decent. 
I wouldn't recommend this place. There is much better places right in market square."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Not a place to linger after finishing your meal with another beer. 

Service was not overly friendly but attentive. Sandwiches were perfect size for me. Did have the cheesesteak which was more like faux-meat pressed into a burger patty which would've been fine except it tasted about as good as it looked- meh.  Will have to check out again next trip into town and make sure I get something besides the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Cheap, satisfying, and quick. They're even open late. Perfect for any college student."}
{"text":"I was just visiting Pittsburgh and I never been to the city before so I came here because everyone said that Primanti Brothers is a rite of passage.  So I went.

HISTORY:  The original one is located in the Pittsburgh Strip District, a really busy area along with the Allegheny River which are dotted with warehouses and produce yards.  The owner, Joe Primanti, invented his famous sandwich during the Great Depression.  This spawned all kinds of sandwiches and the restaurant became a stop for late-night and early-morning workers.  For decades, it was a big food stop for truck drivers. Because they usually had to get their burgers or sandwiches to go, the restaurant started putting the fries inside the burgers and sandwiches so they can eat their entire meal with ease while driving. That eventually became their signature piece for all their sandwiches. Even though it's an eatery for all and is a foodery stop for everyone crazy about the Burgh, the original Primantis still keeps it's super large parking lot for truck drivers to make their routine stop for food. Pittsburgh is a working class city who loves (LOVES) their sports so Primanti Brothers is an insanely popular place to pre or post-game or to game-game while eating and drinking. It's now a chain that is all throughout the east coast but in Pittsburgh it's a staple.  Whenever TV stations (notably ESPN) do an expose on the city, Primanti Brothers is always mentioned, visited and spotlighted.

FOOD: Heavy. They put their fries inside their burger. Um, I guess that's a novelty but conceptually it's like a turducken. Kind of too much.  But excess is the theme of all their signature burgers and sandwiches or you can custom-make your excess.  Add more fries, sauces, an egg, double up on meat, combine different kinds of meat.  Mention the word diet and everyone will look at you as if you're from California, which in this case, is true. But the restaurant, per their menu, states that their sandwiches are only the number 2 favorite.  The title of number one favorite goes to beer.  Not a particular kind.  Just beer in general.  Smile.

SERVICE: Incredibly friendly and they love the question \"What's your favorite?\" to which the answer will, again, be beer.  Another smile.  Tell them you're new and just visiting Pittsburgh, they'll relish the opportunity to fill you in on not just the favorites of the menu but their personal favorites in the city at large.

CONSENSUS:  Definitely not a place to eat if you're dieting, paleo or vegan unless it's a cheat day or you relapse into the world of meat.  But if you can appreciate the hearty sports bar fanfare, you'll find yourself at home here with your stomachs full.  The restaurant, itself, is very welcoming and the bar area is incredibly social, especially if there is a game playing.  As a visiter of the city as a whole, I don't know if this is characteristic to the restaurant or the city as a whole, but, regardless, I will swing by again when I have business in Pittsburg in the future.  I'll just make sure that it is also a cheat day."}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes for the waitress to take our order. After 62 minutes of no food (after the order was taken) we left. We both ordered salads! The table next to us that arrived 20 min after us had there sandwiches and finished while we were still waiting.  The waitress was not very attentive. The manager was no where to be found to even voice our frustration to. So frustrating! We will never be back at this location. This location makes the entire chain look bad. Close this place down!"}
{"text":"This has been over 10 years waiting for this sandwich. The secret to an awesome sandwich from average one is to place a fried egg on top of it. This will send it out into orbit and I am not kidding!"}
{"text":"Primanti's employees were very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is on the louder side and the lower level (there's also an upper level) has a bar area. The service was normal paced. The sandwiches are definitely unique! The sandwiches include French fries, coleslaw, and your choice of meat. I had a hard time eating the entire sandwich because it ended up being very messy, but I would definitely recommend trying it out! Overall, I'd probably come here again and I would recommend others to try this unique Pittsburgh sandwich as well."}
{"text":"A staple in Pittsburgh it was my second time eating here and like the first it was a great experience. Never would I think fries and coleslaw in a deli sandwich would be so great but Oh yeah!!!  First time I got the corned beef and the coleslaw's tangy flavor meshed so well with the fries. This time I got the knockwurst and again just an amazing flavor. I recommend getting there right at 11 am. there was a non-stop line from 11:30 til 6 pm when we left the strip. Nice cold beer, staff is very helpful but don't  be a flake when ordering they will speed you up with their Northeast attitude but for me it adds to the experience."}
{"text":"I went to college in Pittsburgh so I have been before and missed it.  Was in cleveland forba business trip and drove to Pittsburgh just for it.  It did not disappoint.  One of the most unique sandwiches I have ever had.  Would never think that Cole slaw and French fries would be so good but it is.  A must for anybody visiting Pittsburgh as this is something you can only get here"}
{"text":"If I could think of the perfect word to describe Primanti Brothers, that would be, \"underwhelming\". VERY underwhelming. I'm a little upset that the Travel Channel hyped it up so much on Man v. Food. They made it sound like the perfect sandwich. French fries AND cole slaw IN the sandwich, with meat (and tomatoes)? What's not to like about that?

Unfortunately, the best part about the sandwich was the cole slaw, which I actually really liked.
I ordered the pastrami and cheese, which is pastrami with cheese, tomatoes, cole slaw, and french fries. The meat wasn't bad. It's no Katz's, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It wasn't great either. It almost tasted like any other sliced pastrami I would get from the cold cuts section at a deli. The french fries were soggy and flavorless. The bread was super soft and could barely hold the cole slaw together, let along the rest of the ingredients. By the time I was a few bites in, the bread was already smushed and lost into the rest of the sammie.

My boyfriend ordered the Pitts-burger which boasts itself as its #2 seller, but nowhere on the menu does it say what #1 is. So I asked the waitress (who seemed like she hated life, or at least hated Primanti Brothers) what #1 was and she responded with the Pitts-burger. Makes no sense but okay. He went with it. The Pitts-burger is the same as my sandwich but instead of pastrami and cheese, it's a hamburger patty. An old-tasting hamburger patty. I'll leave it at that.

We also order two Pittsburgh beers. I forgot one of the names (but it tasted like Miller Lite), but the other one was called Steel City. I think this brewery might have taken its name too literally because it had an unpleasant metal aftertaste (to no fault of Primanti Bros, since it was bottled).

The only other thing I liked about this place (you know, besides the cole slaw), was the chili. It was a tad spicy but it was very flavorful. So if you do decide to come to Primanti Brothers, your best bet is probably to just stick with a cup of chili and a side of cole slaw."}
{"text":"Walked around 11pm and the waitress was very rude. She did not welcome us and very short when we asked simple questions about the menu. I'm unsure if she was having a bad night or if she didn't like us. Lol, none the less we left."}
{"text":"The bomb-diggity of Pittsburgh restaurants!  Fries an slaw on phenomenal local bread with ever sandwich combo you'd expect. Many other menu choices all of consistent quality...Great funky good time atmosphere without pretentiousness. Lots of Pittsburgh \"vibe\"! Great food, great prices and a real \" in da 'burgh\" experience."}
{"text":"Long wait for a seat, but it was worth it to give an institution a try. Is it the best sandwich ever? No, but it was a fun time and interesting! Topped it off with an Iron City beer to complete the Pittsburgh experience. :)"}
{"text":"We went here after the wedding rehearsal/out of towners dinner ended to get some drunk food. It was chaotic, the women's room was out of order, and apparently in the men's room there was an entire soap dispenser thrown in the toilet. Needless to say, no women visited the facilities."}
{"text":"We heard that a trip to Pittsburgh wasn't complete without a visit to Primanti Brothers so we found this location in Moon on the way to the airport.  Our server was really great and talked us through the menu since it was our first visit.   He was patient and kind and explained a lot.  The food was good.  I had the tater tots with bacon, cheese, and ranch dressing and they were delicious.  Shared a piece of pizza, ours was not very well done but the guy next to us had a piece that looked amazing.  The chili was good, obviously made fresh, crunchy onions, a touch of sweetness.  
This location is very close to a military base and when we were there the place was filled with men and women in uniform... support our troops in any way you can and if you have the opportunity and the ability, contribute towards their meal!  They deserve to know that they have our support.  **=="}
{"text":"Was in town for a bodybuilding show. As a bodybuilder I know my way around food. Was super stoked about coming here. The waiter rushed us and the food was not good. Do not order the cheese fries. Its only nacho cheese. If your a tourist I would recommend Peppi's. Waaaay better."}
{"text":"I was told that we absolutely had to check this place out, as it's apparently a famous local chain, dating back to the coal mining days. We went there for lunch, at a fairly busy time, so waiting for service took a little while. I was a little confused as to whether we were supposed to order up or just seat ourselves, but it was apparently the latter. Do make sure you catch someone's eye when you're going there for lunch, as they have an upstairs and a downstairs to serve, and, as far as i can tell, barely a handful of people at work.

It's probably a good thing we went there, hungry... Each item on the menu is already more than filling, including the so-called \"sides.\" They definitely deliver on their promise that every sandwich ordered is piled high with fries, cole slaw, and tomatoes unless you ask otherwise. The meat might be a little hard to find beneath all these, but, not to worry... it's there, and you can still taste it. Their streetman fries are a heart attack in a basket - fries with chili, cheese, bacon, and sour cream. Don't order it as a side, unless there's quite a few in your party. It really is a meal to itself, and more.

It's definitely worth at least one visit."}
{"text":"Do not care for the place or the food, been to 5 locations and still came out with the same opinion. Nope! Too much bread for sandwiches, coleslaw on sandwiches? its an acquire taste. I rather not acquire."}
{"text":"Five of us are visiting Pittsburgh, and Primanti was highly recommended by local friends. So, dutifully we made our way here for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We found a table upstairs. A very helpful waitress greeted us. Patiently she answered all our questions and made recommendations. Around thy able we ordered Pastrami (with onions), roast beef (x2), their #2 popular sandwich, Pitts-burger, and chicken breast Ragin' Cajun style. We also ordered their pub pickle which was battered and deep fried - it was really good!  All sandwiches came in with two large slices of Italian bread and jammed packed with fries, coleslaw and tomatoes. Everything was good except for two problems. First, there is just too much fries within a sandwich -it just overpowers everything. Second, sandwiches are a bit dry with no sauce. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. The staff was very friendly and entertained all of our questions about Pittsburgh. Julianne probably made 50 sandwiches as we ate and had great conversation! Thank you for handling out of towners/Dallas fans!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very different and the sandwiches might sound gross, but they are delicious! We ordered the turkey breast and cheese and the pastrami and cheese. The sandwiches come out piled with meat and cheese and they are topped with tomato, french fries, and coleslaw. You feel like a pig when you are eating this sandwich, but they are so good! The place was so busy that it was hard to find somewhere to sit.
Another plus is it's open 24 hours. If you go to Primanti Brothers you have to go to this one. This is the original one. Also, take cash because they do not accept credit cards. Primanti Brothers is unlike any other sandwich shop in America and it is so good!"}
{"text":"Delish sandwiches, but you better go when you're hungry because it's a lot of food! We sat at the bar which was cool to watch them cook. The place fills up quick, so don't go when you're already starving, or plan to get takeout."}
{"text":"Ahh the pride and joy of Pittsburgh. Make sure you stop here before leaving Pittsburgh. As the old tale goes steel workers used to come here on lunch break for a quick lunch. Often they didn't have time to eat a side of coleslaw and fries seperately so they just threw it on the sandwich. And thank God they did. A truly unique experience. Don't ask for them on the side or you'll look like a complete idiot. If the waitress doesn't refuse I will come myself and throw the fries on the sandwich. A great icon for the city of Pittsburgh and a great value"}
{"text":"Super dirty college kid food! Bar like atmosphere, I found a hair in my food and my meal was free but what can you really expect from a college kid hangout"}
{"text":"Pretty sub-par. The spicy battered pickles were thin slivers and not spicy. Bummer. My ranch fries were pretty good but don't let them fool you into believe this stuff is freshly cut. All of my friends had their Pitts-burger and most didn't finish because it was so poorly done. Oh, well. Don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"The food was okay there l. Nothing to special but okay. The cook and the cashier were complete jag offs yelled at me 5 different times even though I was following there directions. They were completely and underly rude to me and belittled me. I would never go back there just because of the piss poor service they had and the terrible way they treat their costumers."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to any Primanti Bros location since we are rarely ever in Pittsburgh, so we had to try it to cross off the list. It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had, but it was a good serving size and solid lunch spot. Sandwich is a bit messy but that's to be expected when you throw fries inside (I'm a fan). Just not sure how anyone manages to eat this in a vehicle (I'm sure it happens - they started by catering to truckers). 

We sat at the bar since we were trying to make it a quick visit. The mood seemed odd - not sure if it was because we were there on a Sunday afternoon. It worked fine for us...we were just excited that they have a good beer selection. We enjoyed our sandwich and a great PA beer (Java Head by Troegs) before hitting the road again a cross country journey from DC to Seattle. Kept us full and really hopeful that we were going to eat some decent local eats and brews on this road trip."}
{"text":"I am decidedly not a Pittsburgh native, or \"Yinzer\" as the locals would say, but my family's roots are firmly planted in Pittsburgh soil.  My trip to Primanti Brothers kicked off my first visit to Pittsburgh to see a Steelers game.  Having seen the shop on multiple TV shows and hearing all about it from my \"Yinzer\" friends, I had to try it.  It is as advertised, big, delicious, and not in the slightest bit healthy, which is just fine.  I loved the simplicity of my salami sandwich with cole slaw and french fries, it was just what I wanted and nothing I needed, and I loved it. 

Fine dining it is not, but if you want that, you picked the wrong crowd.  Every single return trip to the Steel City (and I plan many) will include a visit to Primanti Brothers.  The atmosphere was lively (even though it was packed the night before a Steelers game), the service was friendly and prompt, and the food was delicious.  Keep this up, Primantis, you got something good going, although something tells me you already know that."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a place thats been on any of the Food or Travel channels, but perhaps I'm just not \"American\" enough to truly appreciate a big \"sloppy joe\" style sandwich, piled high with cole slaw, a hunk of \"steak\" and fries tucked into it... but please dont get me wrong, each element on its own was delish (except the mystery meat square) and the servers were attentive, quick and cool. Because I respect old school, neighborhood favorites just as much as the next gal, I do recommend this place, I just expect fresh, thinly sliced meat when I order a \"philly cheese style\" pittsburger... but maybe I should've just verified what I'd be getting into before I jumped on the band wagon and ordered one.  Oh well, live and learn! P.S Ca$h Only!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you visit Pittsburgh. The sandwiches are fantastic and they have a good selection of beer."}
{"text":"The one constant recommendation on our trip to Pittsburgh was to make a stop at Primanti Bros. Before they opened at 10am, a line was already starting to form. They've got a great selection of sandwiches, service was quick, and prices were reasonable. The restaurant quickly became over-run with Steelers fans and the big screen televisions hyping the games were everywhere. Portions are huge and while not your healthiest option, this is certainly a Pittsburgh staple worth checking out."}
{"text":"Maybe Primanti Bros doesn't suit everybody's style but this is a must in Pitt.  Every year I come to Pittsburg I always stop here.  Last year, my sandwich wasn't really great and I attribute to ordering wrong.  You really have to order well here otherwise your sandwich won't have flavor.  So we ordered the Capicola and Cheese and a Kilbasa.  I figured the Polish style sausage is packed with flavor.  And boy both sandwiches were AMAZING.  Great prices, friendly people and overall a great time."}
{"text":"I tried this sandwich at one of their out of town locations and decided to try it at the original location. It was fun to eat in a restaurant that has been around since 1933. They are open 24/7 and are located in an old part of Pittsburgh known as The Strip. It looks like a bunch of old warehouses have been converted to other purposes. There is metered street parking except parking is free on Sunday.  Though cold, it was sunny and lots of people were out and about. 

Though crowded, I was seated quickly by a friendly staff person. My waitress took my order. I ordered a roast beef and cheese with everything and requested that it be toasted. A runner brought a turkey sandwich to me and I told her that was not my order. Then my waitress came over and apologized but then wanted to \"make sure\" that the roast beef was what I \"really wanted.\" There was a bit of condescension in her tone as if this old lady had ordered the wrong thing (they don't write down any orders). She got it right - except it was not toasted - and then checked on me after that. The sandwich was good. The fries are very good and I'd prefer them on the side, but then it wouldn't be a Primanti Bros sandwich. 

The area is full of shops and it is next to a sports stadium. Lots of people were sporting Pittsburgh Steelers and Steelers gear. There are a variety of restaurants in the area. If you come to Pittsburg, I would definitely check it out."}
{"text":"As a visitor to Pittsburgh, I certainly can't claim to understand the nuances of the local culture.  But Primanti Bros., aside from being at the top of everyone's recommendation list for places to eat, just oozes personality, and to boot, it's a fun place to just chill and get a damn good meal.

The whole french-fries-and-coleslaw-stuffed-into-a-sandwich thing would only be gimmicky if it weren't freakin' delicious.  It's impossible to look cute and shove one of these things into your mouth at the same time... although perhaps that's the idea.

Now I just have to try all the locations and figure out which one is the best of the best."}
{"text":"They have quite possibly the best sandwiches in America and it was well worth the hype. Had seen them featured on Food Network and was looking forward to my first visit and they didn't disappoint!!"}
{"text":"This place is Burgh famous for a reason. GIANT sandwiches are sure to fill you up. Try the Pittsburger!"}
{"text":"This place was featured on Man vs Food, which happens to be one of my favorite shows so I knew I wanted to hit it for lunch while in Pittsburgh. I tried really hard to be blown away by the experience but in the end it was just \"A-OK\" for me. Nothing really special about it. 

First, our server was horrible and I have hard time with poor customer service. Trust me, I'm not a guy with ridiculous expectations either, I rarely (if ever) complain to a manager, etc.. Anyway, she was really preoccupied with this group of young guys who were drinking a few beers and giving her some attention. To say she was train wreck would be an understatement so I'm sure it felt good to have a couple of buzzed construction workers flirting with her BUT I don't want to suffer over her self-indulgence. Just saying. 

We both ordered the pastrami sandwich and it came out rather quickly. The bread, which is made fresh daily was amazing; it literally melted in your mouth. The pastrami was just \"ehhh, ok.\" It was lean but it didn't seem to pack a real punch from a flavor standpoint. I prefer mine I little more charred up with some seasoning. I could probably go with out having the fries on my actually sandwich as well. Apparently, that's there big move; they put the fries and cole slaw on your sandwich. I was also a little bummed about the fries; they end up getting really greasy and soggy. I'm a fries \"well-done\" kind of guy so this didn't really impress me from a flavor or texture standpoint. In the end, it didn't add to the flavor of the sandwich for me; it actually made it a big soggy mess.

The portions are enormous and the price is right for lunch. Well under what I think they could charge for the amount of food they give you. 

For those Pittsburgh-ians who travel to the Los Angeles area, let me recommend Langers (look it up). The place is a landmark in Los Angeles and their pastrami and corned beef is absolutely second-to-none. In a fight, it would smoke Primanit Bros. like cheap crack. Just my two cents. The neighborhood is a little sketchy though so pack some heat if you have it!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm a non-local hater who doesn't get it?  It had so much hype that I was let down when my mind was not blown at all and instead I longed for the cheesesteaks I used to order from a greasy spoon down the street when I was in high school instead of what I was actually eating.  I am a lifelong hater of coleslaw too, that probably didn't help."}
{"text":"Always love Primanti's and I was Central Pittsburgh area, so I went for lunch. It was after the rush and wasn't too busy but the waitresses acted like it was. I was told to sit myself, which is cool since I wanted to sit outside. But then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me. Finally a third came and took my order. I got my usual.... pastrami, extra cheese, no tomato, add egg. When did she miss the \"no tomato\"? I got my sammich (eventually) and there was the tomato. I immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again MIA. She just disappeared again. I waited as long as I could but she never came back. I finally carried the sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back into the restaurant myself and told the cook I needed a new piece of bread. He gave it to me with a funny look, then I ate my sammich, and then five minutes later the waitress finally showed up. Until then she was just missing. I was so annoyed, but when she came back it was just to refill my drink. A few minutes later I needed my bill, but guess what, she was gone again! I had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it. I was really annoyed. Love me some Primantis but the Market Square one has terrible service."}
{"text":"The first time I came was great. The second time was great. The third & fourth times are the reason I'm giving only 3 stars. Seems like as soon as I said this place was awesome is when it became un-awesome. I learned to ask for my piña colada to be well blended because the chunks of ice hinder drinking from a straw. No matter how many times I kindly asked them, it came back chunky. The food is ok. The service is not that great.. sorry :("}
{"text":"I ate the steak and cheese. It was ok I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. It was nonetheless good, I will try a different one next for sure and definitely with less coleslaw"}
{"text":"Come hungry!
This is a very relaxed atmosphere with friendly service, super affordable prices and delicious sandwiches.

A must visit when in Pittsburg"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try if you've never been to Pittsburgh, since it seems to be a staple here and recommended by many.

A pretty big sandwich, but only because it's overloaded with coleslaw and French fries. There's not a lot of meat in the sandwich, and the flavor is overpowered by the vinegar in the coleslaw.

This would have probably been better if I was drunk and hungry at 2am."}
{"text":"Really disappointing after seeing their sandwiches on TV.
I had the Pastrami with cole slaw. The cole slaw tasted like old lettuce. Maybe it was the vinegar but it was a gross flavor and it overwhelmed the sandwich.

The chili was tasty but not hot enough.

The quality of the Wings was below average although they were tasty.

Our waitress was nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"I know, I know, I'm supposed to give Primanti Bros. a 5 star review because they are iconic Pittsburgh.  The bottom line is that their food is just OK.  It's average.  Yeah it's cool that they put fries and slaw on a sandwich but that alone does very little to impress.  The ingredients don't stand out nor are they cooked to be flavorful."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh from out of town, so naturally I asked my hosts to take me to Primanti's (and they were happy to oblige).  We went to the one at \"PPG.\" The place was busy but not crowded on a Friday night.  The menu was on the wall along with murals of Pittsburgh's finest sports starts.

Our server was quick and efficient and we never were in need of refills or anything else.

I got the Pitts-burgher cheese steak and we tried an order of the Smallman Street Fries.  The fries were truly loaded.  The chili had a nice kick to it and there was literally an ice cream scoop of sour cream on top.  However, the fries were actually seasoned that well and were under done in my opinion.  That didn't bode well for the fries on the sandwich, but I kept my hopes high.

The sandwich comes out and its a monster.  I love the italian bread, the beef patty and cheese, the slaw was good (shredded cabbage, not like southern cole slaw).  Everything was fresh but, again, the fries were the worst part.  Underdone, underseasoned.  Definitely my least favorite part.

Nonetheless, I would definitely return because I want to try some of the other menu items.  I've heard double-meat is the way to go.  I'm intrigued."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Truly one of my least favorite places to visit in the neighborhood. Guests always mention they can't wait to try go here. I dread it at this point. Id prefer to never go back to this location. The staff is friendly. The bar isn't terrible, but the food is. You would think that since this is a chain then the food would be the same. Wrong. Somehow this location serves up poorly executed examples of menu items. Save yourself the hassle. Go to any other Primanti's besides this one."}
{"text":"You can't come to Pittsburgh and not go to Primanti Bros.  So we came. 

The hubby and I shared the Pitts-burger with an egg as well as a Corned Beef and Cheese.  We both preferred the corned beef. The Pitts-burger patty was strangely peppery and globbed together. 

We enjoyed our meal but it's definitely not a meaI I would want to have on the regular. I liked the coleslaw. It's was shredded fine and added a nice refreshing crunch to the sandwich. The fries I definitely like on the side. It kind of disappears in the sandwich and does nothing for it."}
