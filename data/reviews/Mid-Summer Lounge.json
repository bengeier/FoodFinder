{"text":"It is a highly recommended place to have traditional hand-made and fresh Chinese dumplings, buns (Bao zi), and noodles with a variety of flavors. The managers are nice to welcome and serve all the customers either dine in or take out. Also an important thing is that the price is very fair!"}
{"text":"Dumplings and Bun are really good! Best in town! Especially the pork bum, can't stop eating it! This really was the food I'd gladly have again."}
{"text":"If you'd like traditional HAND-MADE dumplings, you're at the right place. Recommend beef-carrot dumplings and pork cabbage dumplings. 
Compared to many Chinese restaurants, they are very neat and clean, most importantly, with a fair price! Great place for lunch.
They also serve Chinese traditional buns (Bao Zi), much like American wraps/gyros in a traditional Chinese way!

A few advice to the restaurant: 
1. The restaurant sign could be bigger or more obvious - me as a first-time customer, it took a while for me to find the restaurant and door entrance.
2. There should be at least one person staying in the lounge and greeting customers. The first time I stepped in, I was wandering around and not sure if I should find a seat myself OR to be seated.

Still great food and an awesome place overall! Good luck."}
{"text":"Mid-Summer Lounge is one of those places you really want to like. Most of the places that serve Chinese food in Champaign are not really authentic, so my expectations have been tempered. 
I'll start with the good:

The food is here is great - I got the Beef and Onion dumplings and they tasted great (a plate of dumplings is $9.81 with tax). I would recommend dipping dumplings in the Chili sauce and eating them.  The interiors are pretty cool and honestly much better than most other stores in Campustown.

The bad:
The service here needs serious work. It seems like most of the staff cannot speak English, and to order, I had to enlist the help of customers who could speak Chinese. There is \"menu\" on the wall made out of wooden placards, but everything is written with Chinese characters. There is no English menu. I get wanting to stick to your \"theme\" of not having English on the walls but what really makes it worse is that your staff cannot help customers order either (because they don't speak English). 

It will take a while for your food to be made because it is prepared fresh. It took almost 30 minutes to get my order. Since I was warned beforehand about how long it would take, I agreed to wait. But service here is really slow and you'll need a Chinese friend (or at least know how to say what you ordered in Chinese) when one of the staff comes out and calls out the dish you ordered.

It's a cool place and the food tastes great but I don't think I'll go back until the service is better."}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend. 

The food was beyond fantastic. I had ben really wanting to try the food since they opened and I was not disappointed.

I usually need help cutting food etc. (my friends too - disabilities don't lend themselves to stellar dexterity) and the staff were more than helpful in dishing out food. 

It might be a tad extensive for some, but it's totally worth it. Great atmosphere for having a social dinner, and the place was packed! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorate Chinese restaurant near the school. It is super good for a two-person dinner or lunch if you would like to try authentic Chinese flavor.  

The restaurant has a beautiful name outside with a traditional and mysterious imago. The environment is quiet and tasteful as if you can chat in an alley under the moon in mid-summer.

The spicy beef noodle is fantastic with extra spicy oil and vinegar. The noodles could be better if the restaurant use hand-made ones. Still it could be the best Chinese restaurant for you to try noodles."}
{"text":"Great soup base! The only complaint is that the noodles are not chewy enough, the rest of bowl tastes exactly like what I had in China."}
{"text":"I quite like this restaurant, I've been there many times. Quite like their dumplings, but they sometimes got sold out since they are hand-made everyday."}
{"text":"First of all, the name is beautiful and romantic. I tried several noodles, hmm either too oily or no flavor at all. But hand made dumplings are really really good. Highly recommend the dumplings."}
{"text":"Food is really good! Had their dumplings and they tasted great! The spicy pork noodle was not spicy at all to me, but they have chili oil on the side so you can add to whatever spicy level you'd like. Will definitely go back to try their beef chunk noodle and other dumplings!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out! I searched yelp for dumplings and came to this restaurant accompanied by its great rating. It was my first time visiting this area of Champaign. My excitement immediately diminished upon walking in. My boyfriend and I walked in and quickly locked eyes with the young lady behind the register. She had her phone in her face almost blocking our view but in a quick glance, did notice us. I said \"hello\" to no response.

   This being our first time at this restaurant, we weren't quite sure if we should seat ourselves or not. After standing there awkwardly for a while, we made our way through the packed restaurant to an empty table near the register. Again, I locked eyes with the young woman, a who was aggressively scrolling through her phone and smiled. There were no menus on the table so we sat there patiently waiting for someone to approach us. After about 5 minutes or so my boyfriend walked up to her (phone still in her face) and asked her for menus. She pointed to some next to her and he grabbed two. She went back to her phone. 

    Maybe I'm not familiar with how this place runs but I was offended that she said nothing to us. She watched us stand in front of the restaurant for a ridiculously amount of time and gave no instruction, not even a \"hello.\" We gave our menus back to the young lady and left. I've never been so blatantly ignored at a restaurant. We definitely felt unwanted there. We decided to visit Mr. Kyoto instead and received amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best spicy fish fillet I've ever had in Champaign! The service was quick, and the cashier was professional and really nice! This is a new item that just came out, AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! The entire noodle dish was flavorful and had the perfect amount of spiciness. I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to stop by for some Chinese noodle soups. At my first visit, I was kind of taken aback by how heavy the soup is. It's super filling and pretty heavy with oil, but packed with flavor. After getting used to it after the second or third time coming here, I think I learned to appreciate the flavors. Definitely recommend the beef brisket noodle soup. The establishment has made the menus more English-friendly, which I appreciate. You used to have to bring someone who could read and order in Chinese. Definitely a spot to stop by for your savory noodle cravings."}
{"text":"one of the best restaurants on green street. Beef noodles and dumplings are one of the best I've had in America. The price is relatively cheap for the quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"I was hoping to give this place a really bad review because a previous rater had such poor experience.  Service was prompt and a younger Chinese man took my order.  I knew what what I wanted but the cashier helped me out, but the food was good.  The dumplings looked handmade.  I ordered the cabbage and pork dumplings, and braised beef noodles.  Portions were good.  Overall service is OK, FOOD was excellent and CLEAN.  IM GOING BACK FOR MORE."}
{"text":"Just no.

This place does not have an actual menu, in English or Chinese. They have little placards on the wall with the names of dishes in Chinese but those don't have descriptions of the food or tell you what anything costs.

I came here for the first time on a Sunday night and the service was terrible. The woman at the counter has godawful memory and honestly seemed kind of sexist. I stood at the counter for 10 minutes while she shouted across me to double and triple and quadruple check her other (male) customers' orders. I didn't see her doing this to any guys.

I ended up just leaving due to the service and the fact that they ran out of baozi (AND noodles) but my roommate got me some of their dumplings later. They were so-so. Not particularly good or bad: they were just run of the mill dumplings. I get that handmade dumplings are hard to find around here but anyone who's been to northern China or even a decently sized Chinatown will tell you they've had better. Hell, my roommate and I can make better ones at home when we have the time.

No menu, bad service, and running out of multiple main items before 7pm? I can't see this place staying open for too long if it keeps this up."}
{"text":"Great food, origin flavor from china, hard to found a authentic Chinese food like this around here."}
{"text":"The food is really authentic and tasty. I would say it's probably one of the best Chinese food in town. But they are never opened at the published business hours. I went there three times and they were sold out of food every time. It's not even that late! I went there before 7pm each time. I understand it's on soft opening but that is very ill prepared. This kind of service is disappointing."}
{"text":"I disagree with the low star comments here; when I was there last week, the quality of service was definitely not 1 star, not to mention that they don't even take tips. I don't mind getting food from the counter myself or putting bowls and plates back. You get what you pay for. 

That being said, I think the most important thing about restaurant is their food, which was superb. They have dumplings here that are just delicious."}
{"text":"I had the spicy pork bowl, which was quite tasty. They DO have a very basic english menu now. I thought I was ordering dumplings but was surprised by a bowl of noodles and meat. Fortunately, I liked it. The cashier did speak english and was happy to help. They were also wiping down tables. 
minus 1-star for lack of description of the dishes on the menu. Near $13 for lunch was a bit steep."}
{"text":"I had the beef brisket noodles and the pork dumplings as they were the recommended and popular ones. The dishes I felt were ok and not upto the expected mark. I personally felt Lai Lai Wok is much better and cheaper than this restaurant."}
{"text":"This one of my favorite ramen places in town. You get a lot for the price you pay, and dumplings are absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"I'm truly a fan of this place, but only during the school year.   I've brought my two kids (5 & 8) here several times, and they LOVE the dumplings, as do I.  They are delicate, delicious and everything a dumpling should be.   We come here when they have a long weekend, or march break, or thanksgiving break... and everytime, the dumplings are amazing and the service is fantastic -- our orders come out within 10 minutes of ordering.   We came here last week -- first full week of school was off.   The place wasn't that busy -- maybe 5 tables full.... there were 2 tables ahead of us who were waiting.   Twenty five minutes later (and I had the call ticket that showed when my food was order) and there was still nothing.   My kids were starting to complain that they were starving... heck, I was starving.   I go up to the young man at the counter and ask where our dumplings were.   He said, \"our dumplings our made fresh to order, so you have to wait.\".  I told him that we are regular customers and have never waited more than 10 minutes for our dumplings.   The young man again argued, \"but we make them fresh and we are busy\".    There are two tables ahead of us, and they both ordered Noodle Soups!?  And he just argued, \"they take time, so we will bring them to you when they are ready.\".   (WTF?!?!?!)   The dumplings eventually came about 5 minutes later, and they were luke warm at best.   Not pleased.    Am hoping that they get rid of the front guy and bring back the nice lady who wears her hat sideways....."}
{"text":"Mid-Summer Lounge is a Chinese restaurant that showcases various types of dry noodles, soup noodles, and dumplings.

My whole table ordered noodles with soup. My soup came with pork and pickled vegetables. The taste of the broth was complex and I everything I tried. It's always really satisfying being able to find a soup that has a nice depth of flavor and a perfect amount of oil. The noodles were cooked really well and the pork was super tender. The beef noodle soup was pretty good as well. It's not as good as the homemade beef noodle soup my grandma makes and it's not as good as the beef noodle soups I get overseas but it passes the flavor test of a beef noodle soup in a restaurant in America. It was really filling but not too heavy. The noodles were also cooked well and the meat was tender with the perfect amount of salt.

The service here is a little bit subpar. It can get difficult to grab a table during lunch / dinner times because you have to seat yourself. A lot of single diners come here and sit at four person tables because of the lack of smaller tables or booths. Dirty plates are also not immediately taken away and so a lot of tables are empty but occupied by trays full of used bowls. We sat at a table with dirty plates and it took about 25min for the items to be removed. I think this problem can be attributed to understaffing. The whole time we were there, there was just one girl taking orders at the counter and clearing the plates. 

Like other yelpers have mentioned, the language barrier here can be an issue if you're looking to customize specific menu items or special orders. However, like in most foreign places, I find it easy to simply point at pictures and pay when asked."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Chinese food. Focused menu, and they get the flavors right. And for all the people complaining about the language barrier, here's my take: it's part of the experience! When I step into the restaurant I feel transported to a different country, and now I am the foreigner! Everybody, including the customers, is speaking Mandarin, and that forces me to communicate with the cashier rather than just read off of a boring English menu.

There is always just enough seating for everyone, but--- Oh no! --- you might have to sit with someone you don't know.  This restaurant gives you an excuse to sit with that cute Chinese boy or girl sitting alone eating pork noodles.

That being said, I am not Chinese, so I don't have much say in what is authentic Chinese or not! But at least that is the way it seems to me; also the sheer volume of Chinese International students that I see enjoying a meal here attests to this as well.  

Definitely worth visiting at least once. You could spend thousands of dollars to buy a plane ticket to visit China, or just spend 9 dollars to get a taste of China right here in Campus Town."}
{"text":"Has to be the most authentic food in town. Interior is clean and modern, loved their noodle. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I went there twice. The first time I went with two American friends. I ordered the dumplings since they're cheaper and seemed to be a safer option. One friend ordered Pork noodles. My dumplings are good and authentic, although a little bit salty. My friend's pork noodles looked really good, and I decided that I should come back for the noodles. 

I went alone today and got beef brisket noodles. I was really amazed by how good it is. It's authentic Chinese flavor but not like anything I had before. It's on the expensive side since it's more than $14 after tax, but you don't have to pay tip here.

The only thing you may want to know before you go is that the service is probably not particularly good (but again you don't pay tip here). You probably should go with a Chinese friend who has better ideas and can recommend things to you."}
{"text":"Solid beef brisket noodles and pork&nappa cabbage dumplings here."}
{"text":"I love this place; the mood is intimate and the workers are kind. Their noodles are oily but delicious and that's what i feel is authentic. their style of noodle tastes like a mix between buckwheat and classic chinese flour noodle. The establishment is niche in noodle and dumplings and it does it very well. The portions are fair for the price and i always have left overs, which is best packed separately, broth from noodles, to maintain the chewiness of the noodles. i just can't stop coming back here! I get zacai pork noodle soup (off menu). V good every time."}
{"text":"The food is good! I knocked off a star because I came in for their dumplings but the cashier lady said they didn't have any. Maybe it was the language barrier but I was a bit upset. Anyway, I went ahead and got the beef noodles and was not disappointed. The noodle bowls are a good portion are very fragrant. It's a bit oily but eating it felt better than home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Authentic & satisfying, also relatively inexpensive. Looking forward to going back the next time I'm in Champaign."}
{"text":"I always appreciate authentic Chinese food places in america. As a Chinese student in US, whenever I go to Chinese food in America, I always get hesitated. What if it's over sweet, salty or oily to fit with the \"American taste\", just like your general Chinese takeout place with panda or great Wall in their names are. 

However, to my very surprise, this place has some fairly decent dumplings and buns, which tasted just like what I can get at my hometown in China. Also the price is quite nice comparing to any other decent Chinese places."}
{"text":"I can see myself go there a lot in the future. Delicious traditional Chinese noodles, very kind owner, decent price. For those who speak English you might found it different from what you thought but you will be amazed by the quality of the food. And shout out to those immigrants who work so hard for their dream here, this restaurant is clearly a good example."}
{"text":"Very good place, beef and spicy fish noodles are fantastic. Definitely recommend for Chinese food"}
{"text":"this was some of the BEST noodles and dumplings i've ever tasted!! we ordered the beef brisket noodles (add the spicy sauce on the table to it - it makes it even better) and the pork and napa cabbage dumplings!! everything tasted amazing, and not too salty which i like
will be back if i'm ever back in illinois"}
{"text":"Best Authentic Chinese Noodles in town! Came with friends several times and really enjoyed the cold dishes and beef noodles."}
{"text":"I haven't try the noodle yet because it take forever to cook. Yeah in the summer, lunch, there are about 20 people there but it took 1 hour for them to get my noodle.?? I mean.. disappointed and i don't have the whole day to wait for them. I left!!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum yum. Love their dumplings and noodle soups. Love everything I've tried here but I keep going back for chicken shiitake noodle soup and the pork cabbage dumpling. Could you offer hot tea (complimentary or for small charge?) - then you would be absolutely perfect. Tip: small discount if you pay w cash."}
{"text":"My chinese labmates have been raving about this place since they opened. I can understand why. 

You order at the cashier and you seat yourself. The service was difficult at first because we ordered with a sweet lady who spoke only Mandarin but we got by just fine. There's a paper menu up front and you can point to what you want. She recommended the Beef Brisket Noodle. It was quite pricy but I went for it. We also got the pork & cabbage dumplings (16 pieces). 

The dumpling wrapper is a bit bland but the filling is so flavorful. Dip it in a little chili oil and it's perfect. 

The noodle soup. That is the star player. The broth is so flavorful. It looks spicy in photos but it only has a mild kick to it. The noodles are hearty. The beef is seasoned perfectly. It was such a heartwarming dish. If it weren't so pricey, I would come here all the time. 

I'm not sure what the hours are. We ended up sitting there until 11pm when we realized no one was left and the staff was enjoying dinner. Oops! They never rushed us or kicked us out. And I promised them a good review on my way out. So here you go :) Much deserved. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The service is greatly improved, there's chili oil and vinegar at every table now, and the menu items have been translated into English.

The food is still amazing and the guy who runs it is very sweet and gave my husband and I an extra bowl to split our noodles.  The noodles and dumplings have very unique flavors that you just can't find anywhere else in town.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and I really felt like I was in hometown! The boss there looks very busy... maybe because this is a grand new restaurant. However, the boss was very nice and introduced us the dumplings and Baozi. I checked the review that some of the customers thought the service was not that good, but I think the service was great."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best authentic Chinese soups and dumplings I've ever had.  The broth they use is so refined and hella flavorful.  I've eaten here 3 or 4 times now and I'm hooked.  Don't be afraid to try some of the things that are written in on the menu, those are their \"specials\" at the time and they're pretty incredible.  In particular, the fish pickle soup was pretty outstanding!  The atmosphere is nice yet casual, good date spot.  Don't expect an elaborate menu."}
{"text":"I came here for a Hooked deal (15% off noodle dishes), and the food was delicious! I got the sliced beef spicy hot pot noodles, which had fish balls, tofu, cabbage, bok choy, wood ear mushrooms, crab, and a fried egg, too! I also ordered a wood ear mushroom appetizer, and I loved how it was cooked & prepared. I'll be coming back for the dumpling, based on reading other Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Recommend green onion beef dumplings. Vinegar is not necessarily since dumplings are salty enough. You can add spicy oil if you like.

Bun is good too, but it is northern-China's style, and I prefer southern taste."}
{"text":"WOW!  The real deal. Had a mix of Pork and Cabbage and beef and green onion.  1 serving is 16 pieces and perfect for a lunch.  Free hot/cold water so bring a tea bag.  The clerk spoke English but everyone else was speaking another language - a sure sign of authenticity."}
{"text":"It is definitely the best and most authentic Chinese food in Champaign. The meat are high quality, unlike another Chinese restaurant using fatty and junky beef or pork, their spear ribs and beef shanks are tender and juicy. 
REALLY one of the few Asian restaurant advocates the idea of eating heathy and green. 
Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Noodles and dumplings are so good! They don't have many varieties of food but they really did so well on the noodle broth. The broth was thick and flavorful. And some chili oil added more flavor to it. A little bit pricy. Beef shank noodle is 13$. But the taste was good. 


Second time having lunch here, I absolutely love the broth but I wish it would be less salty and I would suggest them to add more veggies and green onions into noodles"}
{"text":"Pretty good dumplings, somewhat worth if it only if you can speak Mandarin. This restaurant engages in price discrimination by charging double for dumplings if you can't speak Mandarin.

If you can't speak Mandarin please find someone who can to go with you so you don't get screwed."}
{"text":"You come here for dumplings, and you get fantastic dumplings. If you're fake Chinese like me, you can ask for soy sauce at the cashier to complement the vinegar and spicy sauce provided at the tables.

They also have good soups but the hand-made dumplings are the stars of the show."}
{"text":"Probably the best noodle place in Champaign. Don't expect American style service here- it has a local restaurant in China vibes, which I like! Definitely must a visit."}
{"text":"their food and noodles are very authentic, but one thing freaks me out every time is this place does not provide the customers with receipt. maybe most of the customers don't even care but I am a person who would like to document my spending, and this can really be a reason that drives me away. the charge is already more expensive if you use a credit card than if you pay with cash, then why they can't give customer receipt? I had a similar experience with going with ???, as I had to have a \"talk\" with the cashier every time in order to get my own receipt, after a few time, I just walk away. I though Mid-summer lounge can be a nice replacement, but it turned out the same way. I think they loose me not because of their food, but because of their operation and service. 

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\"???\"?????????????\"?\"????????????????????????Mid-summer lounge?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Only been here once and ordered the spicy fish and sauerkraut noodles and beef noodles. It was slightly bland and the fish noodles were a bit oily. If you can't read Chinese then you may have a hard time with most of the menu.
Wasn't pricey at all and a pretty good deal for the amount of food they give."}
{"text":"To be honest, it is the most authentic Chinese Noodle place I have ever tried in US. Food here is even way above average, if compared the noodle you can get in China"}
{"text":"The older reviews of this place couldn't be more wrong. My wife and I walked into a clean, counter-service restaurant. Drink options were cold water and warm water. Not sure why they didn't have tea.

Anyway, the pork and cabbage dumplings (16 for $8.50) were awesome. These are best eaten with a fork. The inside contains a ton of heat so the first bite with chopsticks is often just opening the dumpling. Cut the one you are about to eat in half and enjoy quickly. The spicy oil is insanely spicy in large quantities.

They had tofu and preserved eggs, also really good.

There is now a tie for my favorite Asian places in town - Cravings and Mid-Summer Lounge."}
{"text":"The food is so good! I recommend the fish fillet soup. I have had two kinds of the fillet soup but don't remember the exact name. The service is great as well. Been here twice and have not been disappointed. I think they were close to closing and even though they ran out of the item I wanted, they made an exception. Super sweet of them and the noodles were yummy as usual. Cannot wait to be back here again!"}
{"text":"I believe in giving second chances :). So, after reading good reviews and that they have English menu now, I went here again. This time the restaurant had just one customer. I looked at the paper menu and selected chili noodles. I asked the lady behind counter if it contains any meat or just vegetables? She couldn't understand English and gestured me to wait for someone. After few minutes a man came out and I asked him same thing, but guess what? He too couldn't understand English. They then asked the only customer there, having his lunch very seriously, to translate for us and he did :). I felt so sorry to bother him. 
Finally we got the chili noodles and they were good. I felt like playing dumb charades for whole time I was there :)"}
{"text":"We went at 5:30 on Saturday and they were closed. Next day, we tried calling the place multiple times to make sure it was open. They didn't pick up any of our calls, but my boyfriend and I were adamant about trying this place. Thankfully, they were open when we dropped by in-person.

I think only the owner is fluent in English. As far as I saw, there were only two other workers. There was a menu written in Mandarin and English on the back of an envelope at the cash register. All noodles were sold out, and they only had two dumpling items left on the menu. After we ordered, we turned to see that all tables were either occupied or not cleared. We had to speak to the owner and he cleared the table for us once we sat down. The tables remained uncleared throughout my time there. 

You can tell that the food is handmade. It's pricier than Asian Taste and give you less portion wise, but that's understandable considering they're on Green Street. It's a shame the business operation isn't smoother."}
