{"text":"Yuck! We went there tonight and first found the cutlery to be dirty, second it took a lot of time to be served. Third my food was tasteless. The bean paste was bland, not a speck of salt, i know I can salt my own but it should just be an adjustment.
I ordered the beef fajitas, the beef was chewy, I just chewed it and discreetly spit it out.
I told the server(nicely) and he did say sorry but did not take it off the bill.
We will not be visiting again!"}
{"text":"It's always been pretty good more authentic then most in Calgary. .a bit of a tight squeeze for tables. .friendly. .one night on a weekend they had a Mexican lady singing was a nice change!  We usually use our entertainment guide coupon great deal then plus drinks. .remember to tip on what bill would normally have been if you're happy with food and service. .burritos very good"}
{"text":"Eating here makes me feel like I'm in the Mayan.  It feels and tastes, in my opinion, authentic.  The food is hot and of good quality and the service, although sometimes a bit slow after you have your food, is solid.  

If you are used to eating at Taco Bell or Chilis, this will be a different experience.  If you are looking for a good authentic Mexican meal, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and received rude service. Waitress & waiter had attitude for no apparent reason. Tried fooling us like many others by saying \"would you like chips and salsa?\" Said yes but then a minute later thought to ask if they charge because you never know. Well yup they do!! They try charging you $10 without even mentioning it making it seem like its free which is so sneaky! Food was okay, nothing special. Before getting the bill we mentioned we had a groupon and showed it to waitress, she has a rude look on her face and said \"okay your supposed to show us the Groupon before so I'll get someone to talk to you about it\" and stormed off. What difference does it make whether I show you the Groupon before or after my meal? Oh right, so you can cheap out on portion sizes of what we order and try and make more money off us!!! Will never go back. Still tipped almost 10% although I shouldn't have because waiter/owner ripped receipt stormed off and shook his head. DONT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Not for kids. Kind of overpriced for what you get. Mole is nice, but you have to ask for spicy before you order. Good margaritas."}
{"text":"My partner and I came in again to see if our prior experience of receiving literally zero service was a one-off. Turns out it was - unfortunately, though the service was vastly improved (the bartender seemed to be the lone server this time, so we were actually quite impressed), the food was quite subpar. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and my partner ordered entomatadas. The quesadilla was very pretty on top, but the underside of one of the pieces was very burnt on the bottom. The taste was unusually mild and bland. My partner's entomatadas supposedly had cheese on or in them somewhere, but we didn't notice any - it was basically just tomatoes and tomato sauce wrapped in a tortilla. The refried beans that came with my meal were very sour, while the same(?) beans that came with my partner's meal were rich tasting and delicious. The server was polite even though his attention was stretched very thin."}
{"text":"Arriva Arriva -- Good Authentic Mexican food . There menu is limited but there is something for everyone. I love there lunch specials the best deals in the restaurant. The price decent but not always the best value. Service is slow but friendly. The Dinner Menu is good , but a little pricey"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Mexican food in Calgary. The menu is huge and so far has been fantastic. The atmosphere is cozy and authentic. It was busy on a Friday night, but not quite full. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Love the food at Los Mariachis, but occasionally we have issues with the service, especially in the evenings during the week. Several times we've had the lone waiter simply disappear in the back for a half hour or more, forcing us to just leave money on the table and flee as we couldn't get the bill (don't you worry, Yelp, we made sure to cover the tab). 

The tortilla soup is absolutely unbelievable and I can't recommend it enough. The rest of the food falls squarely into the \"decent Mexican (not Tex-mex)\" category.

I do not recommend the nachos; they dump all the sauces including pico on top, and the resulting mess makes the chips limp almost immediately."}
{"text":"Always enjoy good Mexican food so we were delighted to find a Groupon for a restaurant we hadn't tried - Los Mariachis. Arrived only to be greeted by a sign on the door saying they would not be honouring the Groupon but would only give the purchase value! After driving across the city, disappointment was an under statement. We asked the server what's up and he stated it wasn't his fault and to ask the owner when he's in on Friday! I felt sorry for this guy as he'd been left to fend off all the disappointed potential customers. We decided to stay and did enjoy our meal. But, the atmosphere was tainted by an owner who obviously has no ethics and no interest in seeing his business succeed. Too bad because I think we would have been a returning customer!!"}
{"text":"I feel badly and can't rate this Resteraunt. We were very excited to go because we love Mexican food, and read good things about this. We arrived and there were empty tables, so we grabbed one as we did not see any staff available to seat us. After sitting for quite some time, what looked like the bar tender finally dropped of some menus. We sat there for another extended period and didn't see a server. So while the Resteraunt looks fun and smelled good, and the people who were there were enjoying what looked like delicious food, we left without eating."}
{"text":"Holy Mexican Yum, Batman! We came to this place because we had a coupon. What a great little place. It's really quiet and cozy and some of the best authentic Mexican I've had in Calgary to date. 

I had the Steak Taco's and they were perfectly seasoned and cooked and were paired with a little rice and guacamole. My boyfriend had the Quattro which had a selection of four types of Mexican food including burritos and enchiladas. The staff are laid back (Mexican style!) and very friendly. 

Prices were a little high for someplace that resides on MacLeod Tr but the food is so yummy, it's almost worth it. If you're El Chepo, I don't recommend this place unless you have a coupon. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is very authentic Mexican.  The service is great.  Well worth the trip.  The El Cutro is a awesome combo!  The Mole sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times.... mostly I crave their Pozole soup, a traditional spicy soup common in Mexico even though flavor varies from city to city, this restaurant makes a really good pozole.

Also super tasty there, tacos AND the best... Chiles rellenos... sometimes spicy, sometimes not so much but just loved them!

I would give them 5 stars, i think they just need to improve their service, sometimes it takes a while to get food or even drinks, but wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Very authentic food and atmosphere. Whenever I want a taste of Mexico I come here...

Oh my god this is so yummy..."}
{"text":"Have tried this place 3 time... first time was lunch.. no one in the place, sat down no greeting, table was filthy sat and waited got no service.. looked for clean table, all were filthy so left. 2 years later tried again with Groupon, service was still bad, food was passable at best so had another groupon tonight.. made reservations, walked in, no greeting, found some kid who had no intersst what so ever.. finally got seated sat for 10 mins before service, odered a beer and some appy called chorizo con queso which was nothung more than ground sausage with cheese melted on top.. something a teenager might invent at home.. edible but awefull. So we sit there for 10 more minutes with empty dishes waiting to order main course, again no service, eventually some one picks up dishes and walks away without any comment what so ever much less asking what else we would like.. so we sit there for however long with absolutely zero attention, by the way only 2 other tables in the place, finally first kid comes by and say your food will be here soon..PARDON..WE HAVENT ORDER ANYTHING..NO ONE HAS COME TO TALK TO US. So we ask for bill and give him $35 groupon coupon for $25 dollars and scoot. Guy suddenly wakes up and chases us into parking lot to tell us coupon is only good monday to friday..OMG.. we did have 2 coupons one was good for weekends thank god.. will not be using other one.. anyone want a coupon..expires Nov"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant.  Service was very quick and meals are fresh and tasty.   We ran out of chips with our appetizer and they brought us a boatload more.  The salsa and guacamole are so fresh you can eat it by the spoonful.  Don't do it tho as they bring you ample food with all the fixings so you'll feel good and satisfied when you roll outta there."}
{"text":"Went last night and found it quite good, nice presentation and atmosphere.
The burrito's could have been a little spicier but on the whole, quite good."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever. Expensive, not tasty at all and really small (inexistent) side orders for my take out order.

- Tortilla soup = Chicken broth.
- Side orders = Really Small.
- Answer after complaining = Even worst than the food.

Save money and avoid a very bad experience visiting this place."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall has been in operation for about 11 years and even though it doesn't seem to busy it's awesome best Mexican food I have had I a long time. Awesome guacamole great salsas. The beans are a bit bland but still taste great."}
{"text":"While the food holds very true to Mexico - (not the resort type either) the service was terrible.
Admitedly it was Cinco de Mayo, it was also a booking for 11-16 ppl for my birthday so I wanted ti to be a fun and great occassion. 
One of my guests cancelled her order after waiting over 1 hour - how long does it really take to make Chicken Fajitas. One of the servers kept appologizing that it was so busy because of Cinco de Mayo - instead of appologizing, staff accordingly - forgotten orders are the result of neglect and forgetfullness... 
Other people received their food before drinks. Which really doesn't add to a fun atmosphere..
There were a number of people in the kitchen, though only 2 servers - 1 of which was a bar tender. 
People had been turned away because of no recservations...  
When it came time for the bills, there was such a mix up.
The food was worth the visit (except for 3 who experienced stomach issues later) the service will not bring me back.

Altogether we spent a significant amount of money to have had a less than good experience."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, a bit later in the afternoon.  The server was very nice, but a tad forgetful (we had to ask for water three times, but were given lots of extra napkins.)  
I liked the prices, lunch cost us about $70, for four mains and four margaritas/daquiris.  The strawberry daiquiris were quite good, the lime was rather sweet.  We were all quite full after our meals and the chips and salsa were so good we asked for more, and they happily obliged.
It's a pretty tiny place, so I'm glad there was almost no one else in the restaurant while we were there, we would have been shoulder to shoulder with anyone else.
I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent however the service was not great, took a long time to order drinks and food and much longer for the food to come."}
{"text":"Mexican twice in 3 days - each location quite different to each other.

I have been to Los Mariachis about 4 times since moving to Calgary. All for dinner. Normally walk in for dinner and there may be 1 or 2 other tables but otherwise the restaurant is pretty quiet. Not sure if they may be busier for lunch. I also have no idea why they are so quiet. Now this isn't the most amazing Mexican food you have ever eaten but they have big portions, fast service, and everything tastes pretty good.

This time around we shared a starter of avocado with shrimp. Both halves of the avocado on the plate with skewer of grilled shrimp on top - made a lovely change to cold shrimp. The avo was creamy and delightful with a tomato salsa. Really nice spin on the normal shrimp cocktail.

I had the fish tacos, which come 6 to a plate. They are the smaller tacos and are made of corn. The snapper was plentiful and lightly grilled with the thinnest coating. Comes with cilantro and some cabbage. The taco filling is minimal but they had plenty of fish pieces per taco. Would have liked a little more flavour from the taco but that may just be because I went with the mild sauce of the 2 that came with it.Was full after 1/2 so took the rest home and had them for breakfast the next day - fish was still moist and delicious.

My aunt had the trio - which was a burrito, cheese stuffed pepper, and chimichanga. All with their own sauces and refried beans. Beans were delicious. Sauce different enough from each other that tastes didn't get lost. Pepper? Not really sure. She was halfway through and said she wasn't sure she liked it. When I asked \"the pepper?\" her response was \"oh is that what it is?\". So really not sure I can blame them for her not paying attention to what came in the trio :D

Once again too full for dessert.

Really enjoy coming her. Will definitely be back again. This visit was expediated by them having a Groupon on, but definitely not the only reason we came back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican. Family run. Decent price, but not fast food."}
{"text":"We were craving Mexican food and authentic Mexican at that so after shopping at Chinook we opted to go down the road a bit to Los Mariachis. We had 2 recommendations under our belt from friends that had been here before and we had been wanting to pop in here for months.
We walked in and had to seat ourselves, only one other couple were present in the restaurant. We had no idea that they closed at 10pm on a Sat night but the staff was gracious and welcomed us once seated. The place was cheerful, colourful and very Mexican themed! Supposedly there is a singer on weekends that goes around to the tables but we missed her tonight. I asked, but the place is simply too small for a Mariachi Band.
I asked some questions regarding the menu (which were sticky by the way - ew)  and I stressed that I would love an authentic experience. The woman who served us is part owner, the wife of this family business and I thought that was just terrific. I was advised that all the staff were Mexican and that we would love the food, however -many of ingredients that they would use in Mexico for their cooking was absent in Canada so it could not be exactly replicated. Bummer. I noted that the prices were pretty steep but was willing to pay for good food that we could seemingly not just find anywhere.
To start we got a beer and I ordered the Sangria. It was pretty good! At $7 a glass and the drink being gone in 2.3 seconds due to its size and all the ice in it, I opted for a glass of red wine. This was pretty decent as well, Australian \"Little Penguin\". I had been hoping for a Spanish wine but oh well. I had been craving soft tacos so I ordered this dish with a side of sour cream. 6 soft tacos come on the plate but they are very small. (chorizo, shredded beef and steak) Still satisfying but not at all spicy (I should have asked for spicy). Hubby got the better meal of El Cuatro which consisted of 4 different types of enchilada type baked tacos covered in different sauces. The cilantro, onion and 2 salsas (green and red) on the side were wonderful additions but again, not hot enough for me!. I love fresh cilantro. 
The food had come out very quickly, I would say in under 10 minutes it all arrived at our table. All of a sudden while we were eating the music went off and the cooks were leaving out the side door! This was our indication that the place was shutting down. CRAP, I had not even touched my wine yet. So much for a relaxed, enjoyable experience! They could have at least left the tunes on!?? We finished quickly and paid the bill. Our server was so nice but she should make note of coming by mid-meal to see how the guests are liking their food - she did not on this occasion. Nor were any glasses of water offered, we had to ask. Service was lacking a bit in this regard and it was almost too laid back, the service. I did not even get a glance of what this place had in terms of dessert ot after-dinner drinks. Oh, by the way, when I had asked what the signature drink was, I was given the response of \"Beer!\" So if you are looking for a deelish margarita, you may be better off at the Keg. A shame!
The food was decent, my stomach is not really sure at this moment what I have done to it but I am hoping for the best.
I would return if others suggested it and wanted to come here but for the prices here and just OK fare, I would opt to try somewhere else in the area where restaurants are in abundance."}
{"text":"Ponzole soup. Taquiza. All so authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Pleasant service, nice atmosphere but the food lacked flavor.  I had the beef burrito and it was nothing special.  Not hot enough and needed some sauce on it, the lettuce and tiny bit of cheese and sour cream was not enough.  The beef inside was ground beef and not shredded beef which would be much better.  My husband had the El Cuatro (mixed platter) and he said the same, not hot, needed more flavor.  The tomato sauce tasted like a very sweet ketchup.  Once we asked for salsa it was better. The Margherita's were from a bottled mix.  Too bad because a more authentic one would have been better. I can make the same from T&T's mix from the grocery store.  The food at Tu Tierra down the street on Fairmont is better but I have never had good service there, nor is the atmosphere very comfortable.  Hard to find good Mexican in this city."}
{"text":"Price high but food is good! Why is good Mexican food always cost so much? Oh well.... it is worth it!

This place is a little gem tucked away on McLeod Trail. They are never busy and the food is always fresh and delicious. The Quatro platter is a great feast - you get 4 different things with rice and beans.

Stay away from the Margaritas though; the mix they use is poor. They come out a bright green and look scary. That much food coloring in a drink is a little creepy. So get a beer!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant. They stayed true to there Mexican theme with quiet Mexican music in the background and beautiful Mexican decor. This is traditional Mexican food.
I had a coupon for buying two lunch entrees and getting an appetizer combo for free. There were 6 of us having lunch and the price they were asking for the appetizer combo and how much food it was.. did not equal. It was expensive for just a few chips and 4 dipping sauces ( retried beans, guacamole, salsa and roasted vegetables). The 6 of us just got a couple chips each so I think they should have provided more chips. 
The food was really delicious. I got the burrito and opposed to it being one big burrito it was four little burritos piled with sour cream and lettuce which I liked better. However, one person from my group got cheese quesadillas and they were. It cooked. They were prepared to be cooked but the cheese was still shredded inside and not melted so when we asked the waiter to cook them he seemed appalled that we would ask him to do such a thing. Other than that it was great :)"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in this restaurant. It was very busy which we thought meant it would be great - but that wasn't the case. In retro-spec we realized it was busy because of a coupon promotion. Each table had a sign indicating that if you had a coupon you had to advise them when ordering - is this so that they make your meal more special or smaller??? We didn't have a coupon but given the mediocre food - we wish we would have! Not great value - won't be returning."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in large portions at a good price. Been there three times now, and the food quality is consistently great.

Older reviews mention small portions, but I don't see that anywhere. Maybe they ordered appetizers?"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and shrimp fajitas and they not good and the portion size was tiny. 

The chicken was not tender at all.  The shrimp were tiny cocktail sized shrimp, they were cooked horribly and had a mealy texture.  

The chicken fajitas were $18 and was about 1/2 chicken breast worth of meat with about 1/2 cup size rice and beans.  

The Shrimp dish had 11 total 35-40 size shrimp with the 1/2 cup beans and rice for $20. 

Mexican food is so simple, why can no one in Calgary do it well.....I was hoping to find a gem but found yet another dud and a rip off."}
{"text":"We tried the combinacion mexicana (chips with guacamole, salsa, refried beans and pickled peppers with veggies. We also ordered cuatro which included chimichanga, burrito, enchilada and flauta. The refried beans was bland and needed more flavour, salsa was just ok, but the pickled veggies was good. The cuatro dish was decent but not something extraordinary for me to rave about. I've tried better Mexican dishes in Paloma and El Charrito."}
{"text":"Cute restraunt and ordered the combination appetizer which was delicious. For the main meal ordered los cuatro. Thought it would be a nice mix. When I dug in the dish was very sweet. It seems they put some sort of sweet crema all over and was not authentic at all. When I order Mexican food I am looking for a bite or good spices not something sweet unless it has been stated. A little pricey but not too different really from other restraunts."}
{"text":"I got an entertainment coupon book for Christmas so occasionally I will try a random restaurant from there.  I have been slightly disappointed in Mexican restaurants here in Calgary but I decided to give this one a chance.

Boy, am I glad, the gold and red curtains were all too incongruent with Mexican motiff but when I entered the restaurant I must admit with the mural, the tacky Mexican ceramic decorations and the Chivas and Americas Football poncho, I really did feel like I was in a restaurant in Guadalajara.

According to the owner there, his father owns a restaurant in Zapopan and they are trying to do the same dishes here as they do there.  He explained all this while serving me a complementary tortilla chip basket with authentic Mexican salsa and another jalapeño pepper and carrot mix.  I was uber glad because this was a really good sign as both were pretty authentic tasting.

He then told me the cooks were both from Mexico, one from Mexico City and the other from Sinaloa, again a good sign.  There are many ingredients he cannot get here, like Oaxaca or Requesón Cheese, so they have to substitute it with others.   But he assured me that the mole here was the same, they do use the cacao chocolate from Oaxaca and he has cheeses like \"queso de chipotle\".

I ordered the Chimichangas and the Burritos, both lunch orders were huge and under $9.  I couldn't believe the pricing here, not bad.  Dinner menu sees bigger portions and higher prices but both of my meals were delicious and I was very full.

The tacos that Mexicans actually eat are about 2 inches in width that are double layered then sprinkled with whatever topping you want, chicken or beef, pork or chorizo, then you have the choice to add onion, cilantro and salsa.  The larger tacos you see being served here are actually Tex Mex and really are a huge bastardization of the Mexican taco.

Here at Los Mariachis they have tacitos the way they should be small, delicious and potent.  I am elated; finally a Mexican restaurant that I can come and speak bad words in Spanish and eat a decent meal.  K RICO!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. And the horchata actually tasted like the horchata, unlike the usual offering of sweet rice milk at other mexican establishments. Also considering how busy it was for lunch service was actually pretty good. 
The reason for the mediocre rating is the mediocre food. The chorizo was the really the only meat that had flavor, and the tacos they served were one tiny single tortillas. I know typical tacos are served on smaller tacos but they were even smaller then the ones they served us for the chorizo con queso, and on top of that they only came with one tortilla per taco. Every where I have been tacos are always served on two, because everyone knows they tend to fall apart, and sure enough they did exactly that. Just seemed cheap to skimp on the tortillas. 
We come here about once a year, hoping things have improved, but sadly not enough for us to return more often. Prices are too high for what they are offering. There are far too many other taco/Mexican places around."}
{"text":"I visited Los Mariachis for a friend's going away trip. Fitting since she's moving to Mexico. The food was very good and the live singer added a great touch. I did find it a little pricey which is the primary cause of my average rating. There is as good Mexican places all over the city for more affordable prices, but I digress. At any rate, if you find yourself craving pauthentic Mexican while you're cruising down Macleod, pop in and you'll be glad you did.

{"text":"Los Mariachis is VERY authentic.

Not like it is a \"Mexican place\" from a movie - but like an actual Mexican place, from the real life.

Totally feels like I am down there in South America, and not the most expensive part of it.

Portions were quite decent in size, but not at all impressive in quality. Authentic place, remember?

Service was friendly, and overall atmosphere was calm.

Not really something to recommend or rave about - but an ok place to check out if you something really authentic is exactly what you want.

At least they have their own parking. Though it's quite tiny. Authentic, I am telling ya..."}
{"text":"Looks like a fast food restaurant. Service is terrible! There was only one server when we went and it took him 35 mins to get us water. Food is okay, not amazing. Overpriced for what you get. Tortilla soup was good."}
{"text":"Great food, authentic Mexican. Slightly over priced but big portions compensate for it.
Great service too. Try their chimichanga!!!"}
{"text":"A great place to have authentic Mexican food.  I love their chips, guacamole and salsa is the freshest I've ever had.

A couple of things they can improve upon (and would've given them 5 stars in the process) would be their dining room.  The air quality in their dining room is pretty bad.  It's usually pretty smokey or greasy smelling and hard to breathe (I have asthma).  The dining room can also get a really good scrubbing as it looks like it hasn't been cleaned thoroughly in awhile.

Food is what makes this place great.  Their service is adequate and server was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I liked this Mexican food and thought the lunch menu was reasonably priced. I'm not sure how reasonably priced the dinner menu is though. I was expecting larger portions, and was a little disappointed when two of the things we ordered they did not have, but the taste of the food was pretty good.

The chille reyano and chimichanga were my two favorites. We ordered chips with salsa, pickles and guacamole for 10 bucks, lots of chips, little salsa and guacamole. Perhaps they should buy bigger appetizer dishes! My lunch companion said the chips were stale.

This restaurant is on McLeod Trail and has such a small hidden type sign it's easy to miss. So you'll have to Google map this one. I'd be excited to eat this food again. I will give it another shot. I love good Mexican food and think this place does a good job food wise but still think they have some room for improvement."}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant! We were visiting from Edmonton and read about this place on here. We tried to go to a different place but it was closed (a lot of places are closed Mondays it seems) The food was so flavourful and well made. Big portions and a great price. Can't wait to visit again."}
