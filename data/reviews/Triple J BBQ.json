{"text":"I ordered the chicken sandwich and coming from a barbecue bred family, i was fully satisfied with the quality. The chicken was fall apart tender, and the fries were perfectly seasoned. Definitely has to be one of the best barbecue spots I've had here in North Carolina, good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Triple J BBQ this weekend.  Good value - lots of food for the money.  I got the BBQ pork plate and it came with slaw, a bun, potato salad and baked beans.  My husband got the BBQ chicken plate but he tried and liked the BBQ pork better.  Definitely somewhere we will come back to!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ place, recommend everyone that drives by to stop and try the BBQ plate only $7.50. 
Next time I will have the BBQ sandwich :) 
Five stars"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have eaten here a few times. Every time I get Triple J BBQ, the service is great, meat is tender and the sauce is very unique, a sweet vinegar based sauce, which is something you don't see very often. White slaw is a little sweet for my taste but food is very subjective; something I don't like, others may love. All the portions are good sizes and the prizes are great for what you get. Menu is limited but what is on the menu is quality stuff! It's take-out only but a great location for a quick stop on the way home."}
{"text":"Easy in/out, great location, reasonable prices, and friendly service (take out only).  Credit cards accepted,  too.  I ordered 2 lbs. pulled pork bbq and they generously topped it off with about 4 more ounces (put it on my digital food scale at home--you know us foodies gotta have our gadgets).  Nice.

Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of their smoked piggy.  It was tender and I like the sauce (spicy and sweet vinegar base), but I thought the meat was stringy and somewhat tough.  There was a back flavor that I didn't care for, but admittedly concede others may cherish.  BBQ is soooo verrry particular.  Wars have started over it.

I say \"Give 'em try\" and then make your own decision."}
{"text":"Good food, full bellies and friendly service. Stop in And try this place next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"Made my first trip to Triple J BBQ yesterday and here are my observations.

The folks running the place get 5 Stars for the Friendly and quick service.
I ordered 2 Pork plates, one with Red slaw, and one with white slaw, so I could try both. The plates come with a generous amount of whole hog pulled pork, potato salad, slaw and baked beans. The meat was very lean and tasty. We all know that food is subjective, with that said I found the potato salad a little sweet for my taste. The beans were just ok and the white slaw tasted over sweet as well. On the other hand I found the red slaw to be very tasty. The BBQ sauce is on the sweet side and not my thing either.
I look forward to reading other reviews in the coming weeks about Triple J. Triple J has a very limited menu that in the long run I feel will need to be expanded, some chicken and ribs would be nice."}
{"text":"Finally a tremendous BBQ place close by. We have so few restaurants around Locust please give these guys your support. Pulled pork, sauce, and potato salad get 5 stars! I don't usually like potato salad but JJJ's is great. Wife prefers the red slaw."}
{"text":"Literally was in the area, drove by and noticed the sign. All carry out but don't let that stop you. Great BBQ and pricing. Portions are perfect on the plates with potato salad, beans and a roll. We will be back!"}
