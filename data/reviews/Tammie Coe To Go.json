{"text":"Really great healthy and tasty stuff, real important for those flying here and there. Staff are real friendly and smile as well"}
{"text":"I guess its now called \"taammie coe to go\". I didn't have any cakes but i did get some gumballs. Hey yelper, why are you reading this anyway? Clearly you're stuck at the airporrt like me...well, if you want candy this is really the only place to get anything that's not made by hersheys or mars. Warning the gumballs look like heaven, but they taste like nothing. You think bright colors would equal bright flavors, but no. Since i paid $4 for 16, it was fun to sit back and pretend that with each gumball i was eating a quarter. Hey, did i mention I've been at this airport for 8 hours? Starting to go crazy over here! :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever had in the airport! Friendly staff as well, all of the bread is baked fresh on the sandwiches and all the bakery sweets are baked in Phoenix at their bakery and preservative free always fresh and delicious food! Love it!"}
{"text":"This place caught my daughter's eye for their gluten free options.  For a tiny little place, they sure have a lot of delectable looking treats.  Their sandwiches looked amazing but we had just eaten dinner so we did not buy one.  We settled on the brownie (for me) and gluten free chocolate cookie (for my daughter).  I'll update this review once our flight is over and we have actually tasted our goodies.  *Update to review* - my daughter liked her gluten free cookie.  My brownie was really good and would have been outstanding with a little frosting on top.  Frosting makes everything more tasty, right?"}
{"text":"Doesn't it seem strange that when someone goes through years of training and perfecting recipes to build an amazing bakery, that they would be so unaccomodating on a little things that they ruin their service and image? Well, Tammie Coe has great cakes, but they are so arrogant that they won't actually write \"Happy Birthday\" on a cake you buy in the store!  So, you can get them to write a short note (it's not the actual cake, but on a little plaque) only with 48 HOURS notice! Seriously? To just write \"Happy Birthday John\" you need 48 HOURS? Yes. In fact, they are so caught up with how great they are, but their STORE (where they sell cakes!) does not even have a little plaque. So, you can walk in and buy a cake but you cannot get any message written on a tiny little plaque, or personalize the cake!  How ridiculous! It would cost them like $5 to get a little frosting and write it on even a small piece of plastic. So, $60 for a cake and you can't even say \"Happy 5th Birthday\" to your kid? Lame."}
{"text":"Tammie Coe Cakes is a godsend when you missed your flight and and have to wait three hours until the next one boards. It's a really tiny place that gets packed once about 4 people with backpacks and luggage start browsing, but the plethora of options means you can't just grab and go. You will struggle between getting a chocolate chip cookie the size of your face, or TWO cookies the size of your face. The chocolate chip cookie was chewy and soft, and was a little more than $3. They also have other options like bar cookies, cupcakes and puddings."}
{"text":"I'm very torn on this spot. It's located at the end of the A concourse near gates A25-30. It's a small stand but has a good number of options including some relatively healthy ones. The food quality and selection are solid with lots of sandwiches, salads, veggie/hummus boxes and even a lovely meat/cheese/olive tray. It's some of the better looking and tasting airport food that we've experienced in the memorable past...unfortunately it's also some of the most expensive- hence my dilemma!  A choice of ham and swiss on a pretzel roll, a caprese sandwich, a charcuterie (ish) plate or a salad with chicken and crunchy noodles are all enviable options whilst in the airport. Paying $10 a shot is not. After -drooling over the options, we opted for a salad, some ham/swiss sliders and a yogurt - $27 later, we had ourselves some delicious lunch.  I suppose it's pseudo-acceptable or at least expected at an airport. Not since a now infamous $12 breakfast sandwich at the San Diego airport have I had to think so long about whether nourishment warrants such a price! In this case, it was and despite the steep price tag, we very much enjoyed it. The four of us had plenty and didn't have a chance to sample anything off the sweet board - they have tons of cookies, candies and cupcakes - all do which looked excellent!  A great spot to grab some food and/or a snack!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here just before the week of Christmas. They surprised me with quite a few really fresh options.  I ended up buying a chicken Cesar Salad, as well as a flourless Chocolate cake. The Salad was amazing. I am not one to say that about a salad. But, this one was great. It could of had a bit more dark green lettuce, as well as a few less spines in it. But, the cheese was really good, very flavorful. Plus, it had shredded Chicken in it as well.   The Chocolate cake was rich and very good. I could not even eat it all. Great food, they have really upped the ante as they say. Great place to stop into in Terminal 4."}
{"text":"This is just a little grab n go spot outside of gate A25. A few different baked sweets like sweet potato bread, chocolate chip cookies, brownies and cupcakes, are available. There is also a variety of candies and quick meals. You can find a few different items than you would at the news stand.  If you're thinking baked good, definitely go for the ooey gooey cupcake. Very good and not too much icing. It's a moist cake with a rich icing and not a bad way to wait for the next flight. The chocolate chip cookie was not what I expected. A little dry and not quite the flavor of homemade. You can tell it wasn't a frozen drop and bake cookie but it's not what your mama made."}
{"text":"If you're running between flights in Phoenix Sky Harbor's Terminal 4 please don't miss a visit to Tammie's. Wonder food and wonderful service. Yes that's right it's at an airport!!!"}
{"text":"Yogurt Parfait ($5.49): I got nauseas from my Burbank flight to Phoenix and I wanted to get some yogurt.  It was a painful $5.49 that I spent and it didn't make me feel any better......"}
{"text":"I was about to jump on a flight back to LAX and needed a light meal to grab and go.  Tammie Coe Cakes was close to my gate at terminal 4.  Immediately I realized that this was not your usual airport food establishment, that they were catering to foodies with specialized taste buds.    I picked up a turkey and cheese sandwich on a croissant plus a colorful rice crispy square.  Had the turkey and cheese sandwich on the plane.  It was wonderful.  Croissant was fresh and flakey while the filling was perfect.  It hit the spot.  I just had the rice crispy treat for breakfast.  It was delicious.  Always wonderful to find a quality food establishment at an airport.  I will be at terminal 4 again tomorrow and will once again stop by Tammie Coe Cakes."}
{"text":"Yikes! Wow price gouging..I know that's normal to do at the airport...but this even seems higher than most. Cheaper to go with unhealthy drink than to purchase a bottle of water!!! Over six dollars for a small milk and iced tea. $10 for a Caesar salad....need to give more salad dressing in the package."}
{"text":"I only bought one piece on blueberry banana pound cake on my quick layover in the Phoenix airport, but damned if it wasn't the best blueberry banana pound cake I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't have a good experience like others have had on here. I asked the girl at the check out counter if there as any breakfast food and her remark to me was \"what you see, is what you get,\" but another customer pointed to the muffins that were being blocked by other customers. Then she asked me three times (extremely rudely) if I was paying with a credit card and every time I said I was. I asked her for a receipt and she flat out rolled her eyes at me.  Was that such a hard request?  I'm not sure what I did considering I was there for a total of 30 seconds, but I have never been treated so poorly. When walking to my gate another customer saw how she interacted with me and even felt it was important to mention that she was horrible to me. I don't think this girl should be working morning shifts or be working in customer services. She was too sensitive, rude and she needs to lose the chip on her shoulder. The servers name on the receipt was Tianna."}
{"text":"My first time to ever visit and buy something from Tammie Coe Cakes.  Located inside Sky Harbor, these small shops are huge on taste when it comes to their snacks.  Tammie Coe Cakes sells drinks, sandwiches, salads, cupcakes, and cookies.  I think their prices are pretty good too considering that it's inside an airport.  One thing about Tammie Coe is that they sure get busy.  I was fortunate enough to be the only customer in line at the time.  I was wondering why there was 2 employees running this little cupcake stand. But once planes started landing, this place got busy.  They were prepared for the lines and the service is great.  I was greeted in and out like everyone else.   I was debating on another sandwich, a cupcake, and a cookie.  I settled with the cookie because I would be home for a real meal in less than 2 hours.  The cookie looked and tasted so good.  Try their Apple Oatmeal cookie.  No regrets, I promise.   PS:  Wednesday is their $1 cupcake day.  I didn't have a cupcake. Just giving everyone a heads up."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Tammie Coe - so this review is not based on the actual product. Rather, this 1 star review is rating customer service. I arrived at 6:05 am and it was closed. The airport employees told me they should be opened by now. I waited. At 6:15, two girls walked up and proceeded to get things up and running.  When I say up and running, I mean turn the iPad on and pick music to play.  The food cart thing was off to the side and actually still is (6:28) - looks like there are parfaits on it. Shouldn't that be refrigerated immediately??  In any event, I asked them when they opened and one of the girls, Tianna, immediately became defensive and stated: \"We're open right now.\"  Very rude. I asked her when they were actually open, where I could purchase something and she repeated herself. When I pointed out that everything was covered and the register wasn't even opened, she said that I could get up (I was sitting down at the charging station right next to it) and look at the goods. Not sure how I would look at the products if everything was covered. I had to ask her for her name twice before she gave it to me. I know that having to wake up early on a Saturday morning to work at the airport all day isn't awesome, but that's no excuse for rude behavior.  Anyways. I'm going to go enjoy me some Tammie Coe cupcakes. Tianna needs a lesson in customer service."}
{"text":"I almost have no words for Tammie Coe Cakes. I was in PHX and had gone through security and didn't realize there was going to be pretty much nowhere to eat in my terminal. I saw the lone food vendor at the end of the hall and ventured in. Being from out of town, I had never heard of the place.  Immediately presented with interesting salads and sandwiches. But the wall of desserts... Are you kidding? I'm at the airport! I was totally shocked by this wall of goodies. And...because my flight was delayed, I treated myself to a spa water with mint and raspberries (beautiful just to look at), a prosciuitto sandwich and an ooey gooey cupcake. The sandwich was alright (I would have liked a chewier bread more like a baguette - but realize that is probably not popular with most). But the cupcake.. ohmygod. So good. I think I was the envy of everyone in my row on the plane.  The cupcake trend has always baffled me. More often than not they are not worth it IMO. Nowhere near as good as a piece of cake and almost always better when you make them yourself. But Tammie Coe cakes has it right. In my list of top 5 cupcakes ever - I think this is at the top of the list.   Anyway, refreshing find at the airport. Thanks Tammie Coe! You made my day!"}
{"text":"This Airport Terminal 4 location is a great place to grab some good food to take on a flight. Besides a great selection of goodies like cookies and brownies, they have fresh salads and sandwiches.   Note that this is a \"grab and go\" location - no seating."}
{"text":"This small kiosk has way too many delicious temptations. These are the best baked goods that I've seen in an airport in a long time. It was hard to choose only two items, but we chose the Famous Sugar Cookies and a Marshmallow Krispy. Instantly my husband declared the sugar cookie to be the best cookie he'd ever had and I couldn't disagree after eating one. I can't wait to check out the full location next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wish I could post a review about food but my interaction with the cashier and the overall experience was lousy, so I took my business elsewhere.   I visited today, 2:45 local time at PHX.  If anyone is interested in feedback, please message me."}
{"text":"I had a short layover in Phoenix and was surprised to see Tammie Coe Cakes tucked in between the typical magazines and snack shops.  I'm not from Phoenix but I think it's a local bakery.  I got the apple oatmeal cookie which was huge and I had orginally planned to share it with my two cousins but ended up eating the whole thing myself....."}
{"text":"On both of my stops through the Phoenix airport I picked up food here.  Both times I got the Asian chicken noodle salad.  So delicious. Shredded white chicken, noodles, mandarin oranges, and assorted veggies all mixed together with a light sweet vinaigrette.  It hit the spot.  Their flourless chocolate cookie was also the bees knees.  Check them out if you are in the airport and need some tasty vittles."}
{"text":"Whoa, that bran honey bundt cake is so good. Run run run and get it. The glaze over that cake is worth the run. My husband and I finished it in a few minutes. It was a feel good cake because it wasn't heavy yet it satisfied our sweet tooth. The store is tiny with sandwiches and other sweets to go. We also had a buttery chocolate chip cookie and colored Rice Krispie treat that we ended up eating at home."}
{"text":"By accident i orderd somthing I was alergect to and they did not help me or refund me after I was in such a rush to get on my plane .I really was hungry and needed that money.I never opened it .Now I'm down 20 dollors and trying to get to NY my home.these people are  ripp off  i was in a rush and they wrote almonds so tiny what  jerks .there food is stale they suck .horrible customer service, I will never go here again they robed me..this place is a disaster. They are rude and have no feelings now I'm getting on a mad long flight with my throat swelling. Thank you cruel people ."}
{"text":"This is probably the most unique shop in all of the Phoenix airport.  In a sea of prepackaged sandwiches and salads, this place offers something different.  Mainly focusing on sweets (coconut cupcake anyone?) they also have some lunch items although a lot of them were lacking in protein.  A great go to spot if near your gate in the American Airlines terminal."}
