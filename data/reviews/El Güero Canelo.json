{"text":"Definitely a place to try only once. Staff is friendly but the food is not as authentic as you might expect might as well have gone to a Felibertos!"}
{"text":"La carne asada esta muy cueruda y los hot dogs parece que le ponen atun con tanta mayonesa que echan"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots when I lived in Tucson. I was super excited when I found out they opened a place in Phoenix! I was born and raised in border town Nogi so I'm very particular when it comes to authentic Mexican food.  This is definitely one of those places I can definitely count on not disappointing."}
{"text":"Visited this place in Tucson 3 weeks ago and have been craving it every since! So happy they brought it to Phoenix, I was ready to drive back for more! The food is delicious! The line was long but it moves pretty quickly, definitely worth the wait! Thoroughly enjoyed the Sonoran dog, the Sammy, beef and chicken tacos on flour tortillas. Be sure to get some onions, cheese, pico, and sauce cups to add even more flavor."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Every time we are in tucson we eat there, so glad they moved one to Phoenix!! Owner is usually present and walks around talking to customers and showing his appreciation for his establishment."}
{"text":"Terrible service....we wait for our order and they forgot!!! We talk to the manager and is rude and lack of experience!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll stick to the Guero in Tucson. Tried to come here twice and both times they were out of ingredients and the alternatives I got were just ok."}
{"text":"The tortillas are made by hand and taste amazing it's so good there. The lines are sometimes long but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is the best and el guero is a vary nice guy. I came in here for my first time and I got a burito and the some what mess up my order and the oner came to the table and go me a new one and it was just what I want it he was very nice and the food is so good. It is my new place to go I love it"}
{"text":"I found this place by mistake during my lunch time and I found wonderful server by the name of Vicki.  She was the most amazing and friendly server I've ever had in this area.  I will return just because of her service.
Durante mi hora de lonche encontre este lugar por equivocacion y me tope con una mesera llamada Vicki y la unica razon por que yo regresaria de Nuevo es por ella solamente, me atendio y me dio el mejor servicio con tanto carino y profesionalismo.  Solamente de mirar las mesas tan bien mantenidas por ella y su linda sonrisa me hace regresar.

{"text":"First time here and It's not what I was expecting I been to the one in Tucson and it was good so I was exciting coming to this one but I was not happy hotdogs had no flavor grill onions look disgusting I still think BKS is way better in Tucson and here in phoenix I can buy a better Sonoran hotdogs off the street!"}
{"text":"One of THE NASTIEST restaurants I have ate at. Food has no taste what so ever.  Never coming back.  I'm better off eating a sonoran style hotdog off the streets . They have better flavor."}
{"text":"One word to describe el guero canelo...DELICIOUS!   was so excited to hear that they opened one in phx! Cause I heard so many good things about it in Tucson. I will definitely be back to try other things on there menu!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite mexican restaurant in AZ.
Price is reasonable but taste is super bomb.
I highly recommend asasa burrito and sonoran style hotdog. So so GOOD.!! I love their fresh jalapeño too which makes me cry all the time."}
{"text":"I get that it's new and their trying to make customers feel like they are getting the service they need but shit! Let me me eat my food! The burrito I had was absolutely greasy nothing like Tucson and it's more expensive. I rather eat at Chipotle."}
{"text":"As good as the original on the south side of Tucson! Always a good choice burritos on point and the caramelos are beyond good!"}
{"text":"i've been the location in Tuscon years ago, and my husband and i have been DREAMING of sonoran hot dogs ever since. luckily for us, we were in phoenix, and i nearly died of  excitement when i saw there was a location in phoenix. 

it was just like i remembered! we also had the flan, which was sooo good. 

i wish we were able to sample other sonoran hot dogs while in the area, but for me, el guero canelo will hold a special place."}
{"text":"I would frequent their Tucson location whenever I had to travel down south and loved it. With their new location in Phoenix there is really no need to stop in that gross city for top of the line Sonora dogs. Yeah 51st and McDowell isn't the nicest area of phoenix, but compared to Tucson it's like paradise valley. Their bean and cheese burritos are also pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Went to eat here got A burrito and a hotdog it was just OK it wasn't as good as I thought it was gonna be. the salad bar was pretty good except they didn't have the grilled onions so that was a letdown but all in all it was OK not as good as the ones in Tucson"}
{"text":"I tried this place on a recommendation from a friend. Honestly, it didn't taste much different or any better than la Pasdita Sonoran dogs, my go to place for my Sonoran dogs. I was expecting something amazing, maybe I built up my expectations too high. 

Good place but slightly overpriced, I'll stick to La Pasdita, taste the same, more variety and it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Yowser! I used to driver to Tucson to eat at El Guero Canelo. This place is known for their Sonoran Hotdogs, but I haven't gotten around to those yet, due to the greatness that is their carne asada street tacos. Now that they are in Phoenix, I am very happy. Check out the roasted onions and chilis with the condiments."}
{"text":"Nasty food! Way over priced for the quality. The best tasting thing there was the soda."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  The parking lot is horrendous and the people there do not know how to park or drive because my car was backed into! When I asked to talk to the manager to see the tapes because there was a camera right where my car was, they said there was no managers there! How on earth does a new place have no managers on site! Told us to come back in the morning so we did. We ordered two Sonora hot dogs to go just to try them out when we got home we got a whole different order! So when we went back to them in the morning to talk to a \"manager\" it was the same girl that told us there was no managers and supposably now she is one? Anyways told us she couldn't show us the tape because we need a police report. I told her the cops don't come on private property. She got my info and said she was going to call me never did so I go back and talk to a guy manager and he tells me they called the cops and said there is nothing they can do and they can't show me the tapes because of privacy because they could get sued! Over someone doing a hit and run that's more illegal! Anyways when told him how the night went and how we got home with a wrong order and asked him to replace it he said they only replace food from that night. Which is Bologna! Not only is my car ruined this place has NO customer service and I myself work in a food industry! I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about this place i was very hiped to try it. Finally got in here and I can say I will never be back. The hotdogs are NOT even close to a backyard imitation of a Sonoran style hotdog. First off zero condiments no green salsa, no yellow peppers, no grilled onions, no jalapeños, non of your typical Sonoran style hot stuff to accompany your hotdog. Staff was ok, food was out quick, tacos are very bland, hotdogs are no star here. Maybe try the other menu items but dont let the tacos or hotdog lure you here."}
{"text":"I started going there since they first opened it was great and steadily the hot dogs have been getting worse to the point that last night I guess  the buns were left in the microwave too long there were rubbery and hard on the bottom and just does not taste as good I love hot dogs and I love this place but they better be careful as a quality is going downhill very fast"}

{"text":"To be honest, I've had better Sonoran hotdogs from street stands.  My bread wasn't fresh and soft, it was pretty dry.  I liked the salsa bar and variety of garnishes.  The service was prompt even though I thought I would be waiting a while for my food.  I just didn't think it was great."}
{"text":"Great place. Simple menu and not too expensive. The Sonoran Dog is ok. Love the Carne Asada tacos! Carne Asada torta was good. I also like the fixins bar. It's almost a meal within its self. If you are ever in Phoenix, hit this place up!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place was I Tucson Az. Yummy! Love it!"}
{"text":"Why is a vegetarian going to a taco place and complaining about it though? I love these tacos!!!"}
{"text":"If you happen to be in the area you should stop by and try it! I had a delicious Sonoran hot dog and a cold Coca Cola from Mexico. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sonoran dog, Mexican coke, and flan. All were delicious. The Flan was prepackaged and came from Sonora, Mexico. It was delicious for pre-packaged in a pudding-type container. The bolilo roll was over-steamed so it was slightly soggy, but still soft and delicious. Since i'm a newbie to el Guero, I expected it to be a true sonoran dog, which is bacon-wrapped. It is not here. :(

The lady forgot to give me my coke. I liked that there were a lot of locals who ate here and they spoke to me in Spanish. The island of condiments, salsas, roasted jalapenos is awesome. Their other food looked pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Im so happy Guero brought his restaurant to Phx. El Guero has been super popular in Tucson for years and has finally made its way here. There is absolutely no better sonaran dog then Gueros. We tried other places in the city and they are all decent but El Gueros is extremely good."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 Sonora style hot dogs with everything, A caramelo (quesadilla) de asada plain a Mexican Coke and strawberry Fanta that by the way it tasted waaaaaay better than the plastic bottle, this was the real deal Holyfield (Mexican glass bottle) 
Food was bomb (delicious ) as I was expecting, hot dog tasted just like the ones in Sonora and the quesadilla was good too.
I defiantly recommend this place to any one specially if you are a hit dog lover like me, Spread the word Guero Canelos is the place to eat in Phoenix :D"}
{"text":"Went to one in Tucson and had a horrible experience, but was willing to give this one a try. no smiles from the staff, the prices are over market value. Sure are proud of their mediocre food. 

Maybe I'm still tainted from my experience in Tucson, but I will never darken this establishment's doorway again. FTP

The only good thing to get there is to get out!"}
{"text":"So I tried this place, because everyone kept talking about it. I had the carne Asada torta with flan and a sonoran hot dog. Fresh tortias everything taste fresh straight out of your grandmothers kitchen. Bring cash if this is your fist time. The cash line goes faster then the credit line."}
{"text":"The food is not good! Definitely not worth the drive or the money! The food truck hot dogs are 100 times better"}
{"text":"The food has never been bad here and I come here often.  The Carne asada tacos outstanding.  The grilled onions and the salsa again to die for.  Thank you tucson for giving us something good."}
{"text":"Went today & the bread machine was broken so they weren't serving Sonoran's. Kinda disappointing but o'well. Mucho Asada/Bean/Cabbage/Cheese burrito was awesome. Salsa/veggie bar is a nice touch. The avocado sauce is awesome. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I are on a quest for the best tacos in town, so we asked friends to give their recommendations. This place came highly recommended to us by a friend who enjoyed them in Tucson while in college. 

We were disappointed when we walked in and found an extremely limited menu. There are only two kinds of meat: asada and pollo. We tried both, and were unimpressed all around. My husband remarked that El Pollo Loco has better chicken. The carne was fine, but nothing to write home about. It was better than Filiberto's, though. The salsa bar was pretty good...3 kinds of salsa, along with lime wedges, sliced radishes, mixed onions and cilantro, etc. The girl who took our order was nice. Unfortunately, we will not be returning. We'd rather go to Taco Mich."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Tucson locations. We saw El Guero Canelo in person. Cool to see the owner interacting with the employees and customers. Tried the asada burrito for the first time and it was awesome. The construction out front is lame and the parking lot was small, not restaurant's fault. Bring cash, that line is shorter. I'm so happy that they opened here. Will bring as many people as I can to this place!  The prices are really amazing, we were so full on the $25 I spent on myself, my fiancée and our son.  I had tons of leftovers.  Everything is great about this place!  I don't give 5 stars normally, but I'm still dreaming about our meal last weekend and can't wait to go again this weekend!"}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a part of Tucson in Phoenix. This place is a Tucson staple. We drove 30 minutes to get here. I don't know if it's just nostalgia but I still felt tucson was better but nonetheless it's still delicious. They own the corner and they have a large room that you can se e through to  view how they are making their food from scratch.

Always get the Sonoran dogs. That's the best and main attraction. Bacon wrapped dog with beans, mustard, avocado paste, tomatoes, onions, sour cream. It's so amazing. Followed with a real sugar Coke in the glass."}
{"text":"My first experience of El Güero Canelo was in Tucson.  I follow led my recommendation and ordered the Sonoran hot Dogs.  During my meal, I had the pleasure of meeting \"El Güero Canelo (the owner) as he dropped by my table to ask how I liked the food.  I became a fan of a the very authentic experience. The food was original and delicious in a guilty pleasure sort of way.  

He announced he was building a location up in Phoenix.  As I responded,  Awesome!  Can't wait to go!  

Fast forward 2 years, and I happen to be working down the street, so decide to hit it up for lunch. 
But now I haven't eaten meat in almost two years.
So I go in there thinking I can customize my order like FillyB's and get a Veggie Burrito.  Not a wise decision on my part, it turns out.  

When I ordered it I asked the gentleman working the counter if I can have a veggie burrito, no meat, cheese or sour cream.   He looked at me, puzzled;
possibly never had to make a veggie burrito, in his life.  So a woman approaches the counter and I place the same order.  con horchata!  

When I get my food, I excitedly bit in to the burro and noticed the carne asada.  At first I thought my order had been mistaken.  So I walked up and asked why it had been made with carne asada?
 
The lady says, \"we don't make veggie burritos in that size!\"  Only the smaller ones.  Mind you I payed out the asada for it.  She charged me for carne asada and tossed the burrito in the trash and consoled with her coworker on how to make this veggie burrito.  

So eventually I get the veggie burrito and it is delicious. But the experience was a polar opposite from the great customer service I had in Tucson.
Kinda left a bad impression and I did throw a bit of a curve ball, but these days you should be able to do one less step than adding meat.

I wouldn't normally complain, but the girl was very rude and wouldn't make eye contact.  Not sure that I will ever return to this location, considering the attitude of the workers."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada tacos and a sonora hot dog.  The portions on the tacos were large, a lot of carne asada on each taco.  The have a good salsa bar where you can get salsas, radish, cucumber, grilled onion and grilled chile. The Sonoran hot dog was pretty good, the wiener was wrapped in bacon and placed in a fluffy bun (kind of like a croissant style bread) and topped with pico and a sauce.  Price was ok.  Family of 4 was $38.00."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I totally had a 1 star experience. 
Incorrect items where given to me. I couldn't eat them because it I'm a vegetarian and they gave me meat, even though it was clearly stated to them, \"no meat\"
The cheese quesadilla was boring. I ordered it with beans and they didn't give me beans, either.
They were out of chamango... that was disappointing. 
Their guac was probably the least favorite guac that I have ever had.

I will not go back."}
{"text":"It's great to have a genuine Sonoran Hot Dog place in the Valley. El Guero Canelo practically invented the sonoran hot dog in Tucson and has now expanded to Phoenix. There's not much ambience, it is after all a converted Discount Tire store, but the food is delicious. If you're looking for a good hot dog, head over to the West side of town and eat up!"}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember when living in Tucson.  The Hot Dogs are too much bun.  The Caramelo had bad cheese.  The carne asada tasted ok, again just not near as good as I remember in the past.  Doubtful that I'll return to this location.  Way better choices around Phoenix for Sonoran Style Hot Dogs!"}
{"text":"The best Sonoran hotdogs on the west side. Great service & place. Met Guero Canelo himself. What a kind & humble man. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and I had there carne asada torta. It was pretty good and thr flavor on the red salsa really made it over the top better. Great customer service, quick to get our food and super spacious in there. The only thing I didn't like is that it seemed like they only have 1 size for the horchata, which by the way was delicious."}
{"text":"Omg this is so freaken good!!! The carne Assad is delicious! Idk if I love the seating but it doesn't matter when the food is just amazing! I am bringing my family next time!!!!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed with food and costumer service the owner's daughter gave me she was very rude. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"My family and i usually go to the one in Tucson but when my husband heard they opened one in Phoenix we thought we'd try it . It wasnt what we expected we waited for our food for about 35 mins they're customer service wasnt good either they werent friendly at all . at least the hot dogs were good . we'll give it another try this weekend."}
{"text":"La major restaurante con todas las cosas bonitas comidas. Te amo.

Nothing is this good in all of Phoenix. Thank you for coming up from Tucson!!!"}
{"text":"The legendary Sonoran Dog is something you can't resist!! The menu is pretty simple and delicious. Tacos, tortas, caramelos, burros and quesadillas along with a traditional condiment bar.
It isn't Taco Bell or some fancy restaurant you might be used to, but it's as authentic as you get. The prices are excellent and the staff is really courteous. You'll see El Güero walking around making sure everything is in excellent order.
This is a place that you'll definitely come back to!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Lots of food at a very reasonable price. The only issue is they don't have a fountain soda machine. But well worth eating here. The Sammy dog is amazing!"}
{"text":"No taste and super expensive, they claim their hot dogs are rolled in bacon I never tasted the bacon very disappointed"}
{"text":"Sin sabor por mas que se le pone salsas limon no se le logra encontrar el sabor , ni a las salsas no hay punto de comparacion con el Ta Carbon.
Deben de mejorar como asan la carne y el sabor de las salsas, malisimo el Hot Dog ya solo es la fama"}
{"text":"It is really cool that we now have this famous Tucson restaurant in the Phoenix valley. Hot Dogs are one of my favorite past times and I deciced to go and check them out sooner than later.

This is an old Discount tire store where they remodeled the garage section into a seating area and turned the waiting room into their bakery. The acoustics are rather noisy and they are continuously calling out order numbers over the ear numbing speaker system. 

Ordered two of the Sonoran Dogs with everything on them and a large Carmelo which comes with Beef, Beans and melted Cheese. They also have a really nice salsa bar with plenty of items to enhance the flavors of your meal.

The Hot Dogs were pretty good but not the best in town. The buns are not as sweet as they usually are at other places and a little more on the chewy side. It was difficult to taste the bacon and the flavors were a bit bland. The Caramelo was interestingly good and was even better with tons of added goodies from the salsa bar.

This place gets really busy and they do a pretty good job of getting the food out quickly. It was fun watching the excitement in all the happy customers as they sat down and ate with their extended families.

I'm going to round up on this particular restaurant and figure that they are still ironing out some the typical problems with opening any new location. Come on over and give them a shout out. You will find the experience to be fun and exciting. HOT DOG!

3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the hot dog but the Carmelo? (Unknown spelling) was delicious. The salsa bar was top notch along with the grilled onions"}
{"text":"I visited El Guero Canelo over the weekend for a quick bite.  I've been wanting to visit to try the Sonoran Hotdogs which I absolutely LOVE!  It was pretty good, just like I like it.  We also ordered carna asada tacos.  They were also very good.  They give you a lot of meat that you could order a couple of tortillas on the side and make 4 tacos out of 2. The only thing I wish could have been better was the seasoning of the meat.  There was none that I could taste.  They probably do it like that to avoid food allergies that others may have and/or the chance of making it too salty.  But, I fixed it up with some salsa and I was good to go.  I will definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"The food here is satisfactory.   They should really spend some time training in customer service.   The gal that took our order was very friendly BUT she spoke so fast that neither I or my husband could understand her.  That combined with the level of noise in the place because of the loud volume of the TV had us considering leaving without ordering.  Again the food we ordered was satisfactory but because of the other problems we won't go back."}
{"text":"Hot damn! They finally moved north! Came for lunch on opening day. Same great Sonoran dogs as the Tucson locations. This one is a little bigger than the ones in Tucson. Easy access right off I-10.

About the only negative I can think of is they don't have a digital display of which orders are ready like the Oracle location, and the loudspeaker is hard to hear because it echos throughout the building. So pay very close attention when you're waiting for your order.

I'm gonna get fat real quick :-)"}
{"text":"The food is good but it 25 minutes to make 2 hot dogs spent my whole lunch break waiting instead of eating...and they werent that busy but only one girl cooking"}
{"text":"My family and I had been traveling from El Paso and needed some good comfort food and did this place deliver. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. They also have a really nice salsa bar with all the fixing including grilled green onions. We left sad knowing that this place is 5 hours from home. But it is so worth the stop. We got the hot dog and the special and we were happy! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times since it opened. That means this place is great. I come here for their carne asada. It is tender, flavorful and clean. No stringy and greasy stuff here. The salsa bar is clean, well supplied. I especially like the pickled red onions. There is usually a line, but it moves fairly quick. Cashiers are prompt and courteous. Welcome to the valley, Güero Canelo!"}
{"text":"Delicious, efficient, and friendly staff. Tastes just like the chains in Tucson. Highly recommend the carne asada burritos and the caramelos. Glad it's finally in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It's okay. The steak was a bit flavorless and the tortillas tasted similar to what you would buy at food city. For the price, I'd say Federico's or Filibertos would be a better choice."}
{"text":"Over priced tacos. Meat had no seasoning, I make way better tacos at home. I won't be coming back. Also girls have no customer service they don't even know how to smile when you pay for the over priced tacos."}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about this place from their Tucson location that I tried it out in Phoenix. I ordered a Sonoran styled hot dog. The price was okay, not too pricey. The food itself was not that great. It didn't taste fresh and the employees were rude and seemed tired.
Overall, food tastes bland. Nothing special. I didn't see the hype. Location was not that great and the employees were so unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Horrible experience this evening. I'm a vegetarian and ordered a Bean and cheese. My boyfriend ordered a carne burrito with no cabbage. My order had meat, and his of course had cabbage. When we told them their mistake, the cashier, a young woman with braces, told us that only one was her mistake and the other was ours. She couldn't explain how that was so. 
I asked for the manager, he refunded us our money and didn't say he would remake the food, no eye contact, no apology. 
We are from Tucson and that one is much better. Although I don't want to ever come back to either location now! Horrendous service."}
{"text":"First timer, heard so much hype about this place &I saw it this in the food network (Tucson location) so I had to come. I ordered their Friday special (3 carne asada tacos with any drink for $9) but couldn't leave without trying their Sonoran style hot dog as well so I got both! Was very impressed with their carne asada & quality & quantity of their meat. Hot dog was delicious as well. The salsa bar inside is a bonus. Very spacious and clean inside as well. I can see myself becoming a regular very soon, very satisfied"}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada burrito and its the best in town. Wife had the sonoran hot dogs which were also really good. Overall a great experience we will be back."}
{"text":"This is not good at all! Food doesn't have flavor, all the plates are simple, not even fresh food.   And the place is all dirty"}
{"text":"About a decade ago while visiting some old college buddies in Tucson, my former college roommate took me out to lunch at El Guero Canelo's original location.  Despite the myriad of choices for Mexican food in Tucson, he insisted we go there for what he promised would be some of the best Carne Asada I'd ever have.  He was right.  I got a plate full of it and a Mexican Coke and I was a happy boy.  I've since visited El Guero in Tucson a couple of times, but its been at least a couple of years since my last.  Additionally, I'd never tried their much hyped Sonoran Hot Dog during any of those visits.  In fact I'd all but forgotten El Guero and the fact that they'd opened a location in the Phoenix not long ago.  But then the news dropped that El Guero had won a James Beard Award for their Sonoran Hot Dog creation.  The light bulb immediately went on in my head and drove me straight to El Guero for a Sunday lunch.

You'll find El Guero just a stone's throw from the I-10 on the southwest corner of 51st Avenue & McDowell.  While it may seem odd for such a famous restaurant to park themselves in the Maryvale neighborhood, it mirrors the same business model as their Tucson locations.  Each of their locations are purposely placed in predominantly Latino neighborhoods, making Maryvale the perfect spot for their Phoenix operation.  Much like their Tucson locations, the interior is open and expansive with tons of seating, lots of room to move about, and a simple front counter to place your order.  I believe this particular building used to be a Discount Tire garage before it was converted.  The line can get long (though quick moving) during the busiest hours, but today I got lucky and was second in line upon arrival.

While I was tempted to get some that Carne Asada again today, I opted to go with a different lineup.  First and foremost, I got the award winning Sonoran Hot Dog.  A hot dog is first bacon wrapped and fried, then placed inside El Guero's own homemade bread roll, then topped with beans, onions, diced tomatoes, mustard, pureed jalapeños and mayo.  I also decided to give their small Caramelo a try.  Think of this almost like a Mexican spin on a flatbread sandwich with two tortillas (in my case, corn) bookending beans (in my case, refried), slices of cooked meat (in my case, chicken) and lots of melted cheese.  Lastly for my beverage, I opted for one of their Mangoyadas. Basically a mango slushee mixed with spicy Chamoy sauce (made from a type of pickled fruit) and Tajin (a Mexican spice consisting of chiles, lime, and salt).  Total cost for everything including tax came to $13.

After munching down on that Sonoran hot dog, I can definitely understand why this hot dog is so famous.  But I gotta say that for me, the superstar of the dish is the bread.  It has the texture of a super soft savory baguette but is firm enough to hold all those ingredients in place.  I'm not sure what their secret is, but wow.  And yes, the combo of all those ingredients on top of the hot dog (including bacon) are heavenly.  Tucson made it famous, but mad props to the kids in Hermosillo who dreamed up this creation.  The Caramelo was also super satisfying.  Very generous portion for a \"small\" size with lots of chicken and delicious melted cheese.  The Mangoyada was the perfect vehicle to wash down all that food with a cold slightly tart and slightly spicy flavor to keep my tastebuds happy throughout.

Nowadays Sonoran hot dogs can be found everywhere around town (and I fully plan on trying those out too), but El Guero founder Daniel Contreras can be rightly credited with making it famous and giving birth to its growth as an Arizona icon.  El Guero also has all the usual staples you'd expect like tacos, burros, tortas, and even a salsa bar inside.  But perhaps the best part about El Guero (at least in my opinion) is that it's made this sleepy corner of Maryvale a destination for people of all walks of life.  In addition to seeing Latinos, I saw plenty of gringos and people of other backgrounds coming in and out throughout my meal.  And why not?  Great food at cheap prices with a few items you can't find just anywhere.  It's something Maryvale could use a lot more of.  For now, its great to have El Guero Canelo here in town.  Or rather make that James Beard Award winner El Guero Canelo."}
{"text":"So whenever I'm in Tucson i avoid El Guero Canelo and tend to go to the smaller hot dog places., But i wanted to give them a chance now that they are here in Phoenix.

Im glad I did. 
Had a hot dog(the one with two hotdogs, can't remember what they are called) and split a carne asada burrito. The hot dog was surprisingly very good, a flavor i could not get from the locations in Tucson. I love the different textures and flavors all the ingredients combine and the fact that it has two hot dogs you can actually taste them and the bacon.
The carne asada is also very good, however i hate how they jack up the price on all their carne asada items. Its just ridiculous.(minus 1 star for this)

Come here for their hot dogs. Yes their carne asada is good but because of the price you can definitely skip it."}
{"text":"Okay tasting food.  Not worth the praise I heard about the place from friends.  Prices are fair.  My wife ordered a medium burrito that was probably about the size of a Filiberto's burrito, so just brace yourself if you decide to go with the large.

Also, my wife and I went just a couple of hours after they opened and they were out of flan!  Not sure if they didn't yet receive or make any, but that was definitely a setback since they claim they have the best flan in town.  Only choice of beef or chicken, so if you're looking for variety look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have missed these tacos since my university days in Tucson. So so so so good! Order a few tacos, caramelos, hot dogs, etc... it's all good!!!"}
{"text":"Food is alright but fuck it's expensive for being a previous tire shop in the ghetto."}
{"text":"This place has next level carne asada for sure! As if the beef was cut from the holiest cows if the land!  Best tasting carne asada in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Really good food! The meat is way better then ta'carbon and the portion size is just right.. I had the mega burrito and only finished half! They use pan Virginia on the hot dogs which taste amazing!! The only thing I didn't like is they have 3 cash registers for \"cash only\" and 1 for \"debit/credit cards only\" it's 2015 everyone has debit cards now days!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the carne asada torta.  The meat is cut very small so it is messy to eat but the flavor was good.  Also, liked the salsa bar with cucumbers, radishes and roasted green onions.

My daughter had the chicken tacos and didn't care for the diced chicken texture.  She did enjoy her pina colada bang."}
{"text":"Finally El Guero Canelo makes it out to Phoenix.  Having eaten my fair share of Sonoran hot dogs and carne asada from the Tucson locations, I am happy to say this one meets the same standards is terms of taste and quality.  The hot dogs are right on par with ones you can get in Tucson and deliver 100% in terms of flavor and consistency.  The carne asada is right on point as well, tasting like it's fresh off the grill and never dry or grisly.  I really hope they expand closer to my side of town but for now I'll take what I can get.  If you're in Phoenix, make sure you stop at El Guero Canelo!"}
{"text":"Food is great I would rate it a 5 but the girls in the cash register are really rude. Customer service no good but other than that the food is good"}

Took over 30 minutes...we ordered to go and waited...after waiting over 20 minutes they gave us our 3 burros and 1 taco and told us the guacamole and chips we ordered will take another 10-15 minutes! They asked us if we wanted to wait but we asked for a refund because we waited long enough. When it came to giving us our money back the manager asked his staff why do we wanted our money back and never once spoke to us to even apologize for the inconvenience and just handed the cash back to us in a very rude manner. This is the first and last time we'll be eating at this place! I honestly lost my appetite to even comment on their food!"}
{"text":"I fed into the hype, have not been to the original which I'm told is out of Tucson. Had the asada tacos, a quesadilla for side and a standard Mexican bottled coke. Good meal, relatively inexpensive and certainly worth what you get as everything was fresh and flavorful. They're renowned for their Sonoran Hot Dogs, although I personally am not much a fan, merely telling my experience from a taco-lover standpoint. Worth checking out in any case."}
{"text":"Got this place because I was staying the night in a hotel right across the street.  Wow, so glad I walked across the street to this spot!  I was on the company card, so I had to try a few different things.  I don't remember the names of everything so I will describe it.  The carne asada tacos were great.  They ran out of corn tortillas, but it was still good.   I also ordered a quesadilla type thing that was super delicious.  Last I tried one of the hotdogs, damn this was good!  Love the hot pepper they gave with it!  Atmosphere is great, there is none except this is where you go when you wanna grub or need to eat after a night of drinking.  Go here and try it!"}
{"text":"We tried Sammy dog & Carne Asada Caramelo. Caramelo definitely good! The salsa was perfect & liked the simple menu."}
{"text":"Despite being raised in the Sonoran Desert, I love Chicago Dogs! You can blame the Cubs for that. So how come I've never tried a Sonoran Hot Dog before? They've gained a lot of popularity in recent years thanks to Tucson restaurants like El Guero Canelo. I was very happy to see they opened a new location in the west valley on McDowell Road.

Today I picked up lunch for a friend on my way over to his place. Without asking what he wanted, I decided to pick up some variety. Two Sonoran Dogs were an obvious choice. I also chose two chicken tacos, a side of refried beans and chips.

The cashier was very friendly and when she suggested the chips, she mentioned that they were made fresh each day (and they were really good). In fact, they were better than some I've had in nicer restaurants. But the beans.... They were amazing. Seriously, the refried beans here are better than homemade! My friend mentioned how much he liked the chicken tacos. For something so simple (grilled chicken, cabbage and corn tortillas) they were incredibly flavorful. All I added was some pico de gallo.

And finally, the Sonoran Hot Dog was worth every penny. Bacon makes everything better, but the hot dog itself was tasty. And you wouldn't think that mayo and beans would go together, but it all works. The flavors may not be as bold as the sport peppers on a Chicago Dog, but I will not pass up another opportunity to enjoy a Sonoran Dog again. Welcome to the valley El Guero Canelo!"}
{"text":"Pense que por ser el güero canelo iba a estar super rica la comida.. Pero todo lo contrario, en mi Hot dog salio una mosca, los tacos todos frios y los carne asada nachos son lo peor, la carne asada no tiene nada de sabor...!! Y aparte el staff super lento, soy mesera y lo mas importante es el customer service cosa que aqui no tienen!! Jamas vuelvo a este lugar!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a good hot dog. I got the Sonoran style dog, the bun wasn't as fresh or crisp as I expected and they forgot the mayo that's usually on top. But as you can see, still worth 4 stars to me. Great stop on our road trip, right off the highway."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food but they really need to get their customer service squared away quickly. I ordered a burrito with extra cheese and was given a burrito with a container full of cheese on the side. The worst part was how the person behind the counter tried to justify it. They also forgot to give me my hotdog and drink. All of this after waiting 10 minutes for the 2 people in front of us to order. Don't get me wrong, the food is absolutely delicious, but the service needs improvement quickly. If the service improves, this will easily be a 4 1/2 star place all day long."}
{"text":"Im crazy for a sonoran dog, these are pretty tasty.  Nice big place with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Only place in Arizona that still sells Orange BANG! (that I know of), and yes before this one opened I used to drive to the one in Tucson...the end."}
{"text":"So glad one landed in Phoenix! Menu is straight forward & I suggest trying everything on the menu. Finish it off with an order of their flan and you'll be hooked for life!! 
Clean, open restaurant and big groups/teams are welcome!"}
{"text":"Have you tried a Sonoran hotdog? Well even if you have, you need to try one at El Guero Canelo in Phoenix. Fully loaded and smothered with tomatoes, beans, mayo, mustard, and a spicy jalapeño sauce make this a dish to remember. The carne asada plates come with tortillas made on site. Top your dishes off with cucumbers, roasted or pickled onions, or a variety of salsas at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Hummmmmm where to begin with this place for one the hotdogs they aren't all the great a d they dnt have much selection of anything I been here several times Hoping I would like this place buy honestly I'm done with them. They are over price big time for a large quesadilla with meat they wanna charge 9 bucks really lol I dnt even pay that much in California where everything is more expensive...... everything is so expensive a soda,quesadilla and two hotdogs I paid 18 dollars den bought a burrito with a extra soda I paid 11.50 lol wow I didn't know Arizona paid this good for people to afford this prices lol hasta nunca never going back to this crappy place....."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are amazing!!! Always clean! Friendly staff! Self serve salsa bar! Extra parking in the back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since they opened and, unfortunately, am not bullish on El Guero Canelo taking the Valley crown for best sonoran dog. As pretty much the only good non-UA Basketball experience in Tucson, I had high hopes for EGC-PHX. 

Each time I've visited, the sonoran dogs were very mustard-heavy, the caramello was light on the beans, and the onions were charred dry (even the large ones, which are easier to prepare). Still, their carne asada is excellent and their salsas are as good as I can remember. Here's hoping this location is just having some growing pains because those of us who know the original are really rooting for this one to meet those high standards."}
{"text":"Before posting my review of El Guero you may want a heads up that I am a white fella and some may say I am not worthy of posting about Mexican dishes. With that said, I loved the food. I ordered their famous Sonoran Dog and also a Carmelos. The dog was great. It was very messy but worth all the used napkins. The Carmelos, which I was unsure of what it was, also was tasty. It reminded me of a quesadilla, there is the white in me, and was just as satisfying. Be prepared , it is huge and easily can be shared. As others mentioned, the salsa bar was good size and there is plenty of room to sit. Only slight negative was they were a little slow but not enough to warrant four stars. Will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Visited locations in Tucson for years. Glad to finally have one in Phoenix. Sammy dog is the best. Two Bacon wrapped dogs in 1 bun. Best Sonoran dogs around."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place out considering the fact that earlier in the day a Phoenix local mentioned the food was as great as the locations in Tucson which my buddy that's in the Air Force raves about. Went to try it and The food was ok. As far as food goes, the hot dog sonorense bun tasted microwaved, the large caramelo was a quesadilla with beans which I love quesadillas and it met expectations. Overall food was a 8/10 in my opinion. The staff seems to be too young with no leadership or any sense of responsibility. One of the employees went to grab a plate to stack condiments, ended up making a mess of the plates and didn't seem to care as he left it like that. He then Sat down to take a break and was being louder than an average person. The guys in the kitchen had much more enthusiasm than the average person dealing with customers. Guero better make some changes to the staff he has running his joint or it might not be as successful as his other spots"}
{"text":"Very good food! The atmosphere was fast paced and full off buzz! From the hot dogs to the burritos everything was cooked to order fresh and with all of the adds and substitutions that I requested. The Jamaica was refreshing."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the Sonoran hot dog. I love the Tucson locations but this one left a lot to be desired. The bolillo was dry and they really skimped on the beans and mayo which made it even dryer. It was alright but there are better spots in Phoenix for a Sonoran hot dog."}
{"text":"Decent Sonoran hot dogs . Didn't live up to the hype for me .  Also, not the nicest area or atmosphere on the inside. They have a serve your own salsa bar but the salsa especially the guacamole tasted like water . Next time I'll stick to the Mexican hot dog stand on the corner of Thomas and 35th."}
{"text":"I used to go to El Guero Canelo in Tucson every chance I got. Soooo excited to have one here in Phoenix and not far from where I live. The Sonoran hot dogs are Excellent, a definite must when you come to this spot. I ordered a medium carne asada burrito which is still Huge. The owner happened to be there when we went in today, he is a great guy...very nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE El Guero Canelo! Best Mexican hotdogs and their carne asada is delicious too. So flavorful! They have a lot of their toppings on the side so you can choose how much of which toppings you want on your dog. The guacamole is YUMMY! The owner is very friendly and was greeting everyone (that's something you don't see everyday). They came from Tucson and the new place looks great! So happy that they have a Phoenix location now! I will definitely be visiting often! More often than I probably should ;) Thanks El Guero!"}
{"text":"I had a Sonora dog and a small burrito. The Sonora dog was good but not the best in Phoenix. If you want a really good Sonora dog you can go to 19th st and Indian School on the south side of the street, I think they're called Nogalas dogs. As for the burrito.....I asked what was in it and they said the meat, cabbage, and beans. I asked for one with just meat, guacamole, and sour creme. She said we don't do that but there's guacamole in the lobby. I still ordered the burrito but did not put my own guacamole cause it did not look good, it was more of a whitish looking color. Anyways back to the actual burrito. It was not good at all and had no flavor whatsoever. I don't know if it was a bad night or that's how the always taste. All I know is I will not return there again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for a Carne Asada burrito! The prices are unmatched. The quantity of food is PHENOMENAL for the price. The Salsa Bar houses such flavorful salsas, roasted chiles, cilantro and onion. 

There are reviews that say the meat is bland and that can be true. It isn't oily like other restaurants, and it doesn't sit in liquid, so you're actually tasting the grilled meat. Some Garlic salt and pepper wouldn't hurt but not necessary.

Their stock of Mexican Soda is honestly such an important part of the experience. They have bottle openers available. 


This may have been a tire repair shop before it was El Guero Canelo but that just provides a spacious dining room.



Recommend trying the carne asada torta, super nachos (no lettuce), and the Sonoran dogs! 


Thank you for keeping this establishment clean, and providing great quality food. I love being a regular."}
{"text":"This location mirrors the Tucson location! Same food, set up, and relish cart area. 
The grilled green onion bulbs are so soft and yummy! The variety of the salsas are great! The Sonoran dogs are authentic. No need to drive to rocky Point for my dogs anymore. 
I'm not a huge fan of their beans tho. The parking lot is small."}
{"text":"Being from Tucson I was happy to see this location open in Phoenix.  I am a big fan.  The owner even came to our table to see how we were enjoying our meals.  Go with the hot dogs!"}
{"text":"So glad I made the stop, been wanting to try this.  I ordered mine to go, but definitely worth it.  The place was not too busy this time of night.  Everything tasted great together, and you can add with their salsa bar.  I highly recommend this."}
{"text":"Just as great as the original in Tucson!  Love their Sonoran Hotdogs.  I also tried the burro.  The Carne Asada is amazing and the burro is HUGE!  Move over Chipotle, El Guero burros have you beat!  It could easily feed 2 people."}
{"text":"El Güero Canelo is located in a McDowell area that appears to have a wide variety of establishments/trucks/huts or whatever you want to call them that specialize in Sonoran dogs. They recently received a James Beard \"American Classics\" Award, although this was primarily due to the popularity of their original Tucson location. At the time of this review, there are currently four locations total, with this being the only one in Phoenix.

We ordered a couple of Sonoran dogs, as well as a quesadilla and a carne asada taco. You order at the counter and they'll call out your number, but I suggest sticking closely to the counter or else you won't hear them. The possible schizophrenic lady sitting in the corner by herself kind of creeped me out, but you're bound to have interesting encounters when you're hanging around this particular area.

As for the dogs: the ingredients were fine and the dog quality itself was just okay. However, I'm convinced that something funky was going on with their bun. I kept catching the unwanted taste of unfiltered tap water. You know, the water that has that unmistakable tanginess that my girlfriend compares to the taste of \"pennies.\" I'm assuming this was the result of how the bun was steamed, which was a bit distracting. Sadly, I've had better takes on the Sonoran, including places that don't really showcase it.

The carne asada taco had surprisingly good flavor that neither one of us had expected, being quite better than a lot of places we've tried recently. The quesadilla felt flat, unfortunately. I doubt I'd order one again.

I've recently taken up an interest in exploring all of the Sonoran dog options in Phoenix and although I feel that these are just fine for a quick fix, they are by no means anything memorable.

Based on reviewers who are familiar with their Tucson locations, perhaps you'd be better off eating these a couple of hours south of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is great in Tucson, AZ but here in Phoenix it's everything but good, the food is very bland the hotdogs are always cold when I get them and the sausage is very small and the bread is huge, place is clean and the workers are good, it's just that the food is always cold or just bland."}
{"text":"Best wiener I've put in my mouth in a LONG time!  Ordered a Sonoran dog with everything and a carne asada burrito with everything.  Both were SO delicious.   The salsa bar has everything that you would want for fixings...including cucumbers, pickled red onions, radishes, my fave avocado salsa, and all the other salsas.  Fresh grilled chiles also on the line...they were grilling the chile out back.  The line was long but it went super fast, and the food came out even faster.  We barely sat down at our table when our number was called.  This is def a new favorite.  Plenty of order takers - the register in the middle was cash only, all the others took credit/debit.  Thanks for coming from Tucson - we would welcome more locations in the valley!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to the one in Tucson every chance I got. When I heard about this one in Phoenix I was sooooo happy and they haven't let me down. My favorite ever!"}
{"text":"I love eating at El Guerro Canelo most of the time is at Tucson when I come from California. I didn't had a chance to stop by so i came to the one in Phoenix I love it also but it seem that the bread from the Sonora style hotdogs didn't feel authentic but the food still taste good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the caramelos!! It's like a quesadilla with carne asada! I tied the hot dogs and I always end up really enjoying the Caramelo better! If you're in town and want something slightly different, give this place a shot!!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place not one but two chances and messed my order up twice. Train your young workers to be more respectful and helpful when they make a mistake. Teach them to acknowledge people when they are standing there and if they are having to wait because you ran out of something such as guacamole then they need to have the decency to let your customers know that, not just stand there not knowing what's going on."}
{"text":"Another great spot in west phoenix for some good carne asada. Good meat makes good food. Very simple menu. Salsa bar and lots of seating. Glad that they can recycle an old tire shop to a place where people can enjoy good food and leave happy and full. Wish this was around when I used to live out here."}
{"text":"On a vacation we stayed near this place. 1st night I knew I was gonna try it,  we did!! The last day in our vacation and was Bumed out i didn't have them sooner!! Sonora got DOGS are to die for!!! HIGHLY recommend it. A must .
So good, Wish I had done it sooner. 
Til next time"}
{"text":"I would have given 5 starts but today they didn't have beans which makes a burrito. Apparently they were being such today and Ran out. They still charged full price which I don't feel I should have if an ingredient is missing. To top it off I see an employee walk in with canned beans!!!!!!!! I thought the food here was authentic apparently not."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are good a little overpriced. Burritos have no flavor whatsoever! Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I've driven by so many times and finally decided to stop by. Of course being that they are known The special of the day was the carne asada tacos and although they looked delicious,  I opted for the hot dog instead because I wasn't  hungry enough to have the full plate of tacos. The famous Sonoran style hot dog was delicious as well as filling. The restaurant was very clean and inviting. I enjoyed my brief lunch there and will stop by again when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my experience here in phoenix.  I had been waiting for this place to open up, since we make special trips to Tucson just for a hot dog.  It looks like I will have to drive to Tucson still since the hot dogs at this location do not even come close, food tastes like it has be reheated, the buns are rubbery and chewy, horrible horrible!!"}
{"text":"Those who know me know I am a hot dog connoisseur. When I heard that El Güero Canelo won a James beard award for their Sonoran dog, I had to go. And boy was I disappointed. Dog was overcooked.  Mustard?  On a Sonoran dog?  Are you high?!! The saving grace was the boatlike bun which was soft and held all that stuff together.  Go to Sonoran dogs instead if you want an actual sonoran dog."}
{"text":"The cashiers can never get an order right to save there lives. They always get my order wrong every single time I managed to go there. Other then that it's pretty good quality and the place is clean every time. The clean the table every time someone leaves. One time the double charge me for hot dogs still kind of mad about that"}
{"text":"Carne asada plate is just right for those days you're craving something meaty but nothing over the top. The salsa bar has of course, fresh salsas and fresh cucumbers and shredded cabbage!! YASSS give it to me!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique items I've ever had the Sonoran hot dog. I ordered the Carne Asada tacos as well and they were very plain and only with salsa flavorful. If you stick to the Sonoran hot dog you will not be disappointed. The bun is soft and the hot is stuffed with all the kinds of additional ingredients. I felt like I was eating a hot dog burrito with a soft bun instead of a tortilla. Overall very good food and service was efficient."}
{"text":"The sonoran dog was ok, not the best I have had. The beans were missing  and loads of mustard overtook all the flavors. Will try again in hopes this was an off day.
2nd visit the Sonoran Dog was a little better but still lacking flavor. Good thing for the salsa bar. Also tried their Caramelo with Carne Asada which lacked any spice at all, again thanks for the salsa Bar. I might try again if in the area but not as a destination."}
{"text":"Ate at the one off Valencia in Tucson for years - I was thrilled to hear they were building one up here. 

We go in here once every week or 2. Same great hotdogs, carne asada and salsa bar that you'll find at the original.

Go give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaaahhhh this place I drive an hour to go to. When in Tucson I go to the original. On way home from Rocky Point we stopped better then Puerto. Rock on dudes. Open east side phx."}
{"text":"Great food that's all I gotta say...The sonoran hot dog is great and the carne asada is juicy and tender...The salsa bar is fantastic..this is a must when i come to Phoenix..screw that foo foo Scottsdale crap!"}
{"text":"I love the Carne asada tacos! But the hot dogs no so much. I rather go to a sonoran dogs stand"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and worth the drive out to 51st ave. 

I had some sonoran dogs and a carne asada burrito. The sonoran dogs were the best part by far. 

The tortillas are really good too. I bought some and they were marked to expire sometime in march, but by mid feb they had mold. Next time i'll put them in the freezer. 

Definitely recommend this place, the little peppers and condiments they have are really good as well. You can tell the food is fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"Pretty good I suppose. But in my honest opinion, if you've had one sonoran hot dog or carne asada taco, then you've had them all. so basically, it's The same as all The other places, no difference in flavor. The best part about my visit here is seeing my buddy eat their jalapenos and seeing him suffer, that was classic!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Been going to one the locations down in Tucson for years and thrilled when came up to the Valley.  It tastes the same.  I'm not getting into the Guero vs. BK debate, just going to talk about this awesome hot dog.

The well-prepared Sonoran hot dog may be one of the most perfect hot dogs out there.  The balance between the bacon-wrapped dog with the semi-sweet roll and the beans, tomato, crema.  It is magical.  Like the cheap but up-scale version of the LA ghetto dog.  I can't say enough good things about the this hot dog.

I also always get a carmelo.  The carne asada here is not the best, but it is flavorful, not too dry, with some good grilled smoky flavor.  The beans and carne asada combo makes for a nice filling snack, almost overly savory to balance out the sweet/tart/savory of the hot dog.

It's a little out of the way for me, but I should make more trips out here.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"Blah! I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I thought it was going to be great since everyone talks so highly of it BUT it's NOT! I won't ever return."}
{"text":"Lousy, dirty restrooms and empty papers and everything even every time we came here to eat and found poor service and dirty restrooms (both female/male too) where is owner or manager? They are all young."}
{"text":"Always a fun outing to come for great hot dogs and ALL the fixings!  A great place to bring out of town company for a good lunch a new experience."}
{"text":"In town from L.A. came in to try the  tortas and my boyfriend wanted a Sonoran Hot Dog. 

Well, the tortas were just ok. The carne asada needed a little more flavor. Loved the toasted bread though. 

My boyfriend really enjoyed the hot dog.

Service was good. The wait for our food was average. Salsa bar was great. I loved the sliced cucumber. 

I am baffled though, what kind of Mexican food place doesn't have rice? That was a huge disappointment. This is a family restaurant and lots of kids were here while we were eating. I am Mexican myself and know kids LOVE rice and so do I. 

Come on now....add rice to the menu!"}
{"text":"Their food is mind-blowingly good, service is quick, and they only serve the soda with real sugar!!!!!!

Very bare bones operation but it reflects in their prices."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sonran hot dogs!  They are cheap and tasty!  I've tried the carmelas, but prefer to stick w the hot dogs!"}
{"text":"I don't know where or how the got 4 out of 5 stars? All hype and ummmmmm nah!!!!! I asked for no onions on my Sonoran hot dog and it was covered in them. It wasn't very good I also had the torta and it was some nasty meat with lettuce and a small piece of avocado. Will never go back,,, get some hotdogs some beans wrap the dogs with bacon and it would be better then what I had!!! Don't waist your money!!"}
{"text":"First off, I went for my birthday since everyone I knew loves this place and I was craving some tacos. The place is weird (former Discount Tire Shop) and that day they were out of Chicken??? I know, odd...I had the tacos and I must say the flavor of the meat was amazing! My son had the Sonoran dogs and they looked to be amazing....the burrito on the other hand was just meat, some beans and very little cheese...but everything was packed with meat and very good!"}
{"text":"Eat here eat here!! Mexican food at its best. All sizes of hungry can be stoped. Burritos the size of your arm. 1st founded in Tucson, living there we would eat here all the time. Was even featured on tv,just forget which show. No difference between Tucson and Phoenix location's."}
{"text":"I was told about this place... eh Bc I was starving and we all know when you're starving anything is good. Meat had no flavor - I'm kinda disappointed and the hot dog it was ok. Nothing special really"}
{"text":"The menu is very small for a big building. The food had no seasonings, I had to add flavor with what they had at the salsa bar. The facility could be cleaner. There might have been 5 or 6 employees there and we had to wait 15 min for simple food.  Burrito and a quesadilla ( they have their own name for it, I forget what it is called) with beans, cheese and carne asada."}
{"text":"The bread from the hot dog is really good and you can add more stuff like guacamole,pico de gallo etc .. The owner is really nice and You can tell He is a hard worker man"}
{"text":"My husband I tried this place because he loves Sonoran hot dogs and they have them. He got the Wednesday special, 2 Sonoran dogs and a Coke for $8. I got a carne Asada burrito and it was amazing and he loved his dogs . Will return when we are back on this side of town. Their salsa bar is amazing !"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are amazing. Price is great!"}
{"text":"Hey man, don't let the looks of this place deceive you. It's a little sketch but the food is delicious. Nothing like coming across a gem. I had the beef tacos and they were great! Not to mention they had corridors playing. Haha Definitely gonna make my way back there to try the chicken tacos."}
{"text":"So...a little back story first.  Last year I stopped at the OG one in Tucson.  I had a couple of dogs, and a carne asada taco.  I thought the dogs were very good!  If ever back in Tucson, I am definitely going back.  Anyways......I was excited when I heard that they were opening one here in Phoenix!

 A few months ago, I woke up on a Sunday morning and was craving a hot dog!  I saw that El Guero Canelo opened at 9am on Sundays.  I got in my car, drove down and was super excited to get an early morning breakfast of some Sonoran Dogs and a Mexican Coke.  I walk in the joint, stood there by the register for a good 3-4 minutes before anyone acknowledged me (workers definitely saw me standing there...I made eye contact with about 3 of them in the back, yet none of them ever called to anyone to let them know someone was wanting to place an order).  Finally a lady comes up to the register to take my order.  I ordered 2 Sonoran Dogs and a Mexican Coke.  She glances towards the back, then shakes her head and tells me that they don't have hot dogs.  They only had breakfast burritos and menudo.  WTF?  Granted, it was early (9:30am), but if you are open for business, how can you NOT HAVE YOUR MOST FAMOUS ITEM available?  They said that the hot dogs wouldn't be ready until about after 10:30am. I wasn't about to sit there for an hour, so I left.  I was unbelievably pissed off and disappointed...its not a quick drive from Surprise, either.  

Anyways.........fast forward a few months later.  I was driving down 51st and was about to pass El Guero Canelo.  I was hungry enough to stop and sample one of their dogs.  I walked in, placed my order for a hot dog with no mayo, paid the lady my money (about that....the dogs are $2.78 and come out to $3.02 after tax.  Why not make them $2.76, so it's an even $3.00.  Who wants to fuck with breaking another dollar, or getting back $.98 cents in change?  Not I says the fly!) and took a seat.  About 2 minutes later, my dog was ready.  Here is how it was.........

Sonoran Hot Dog-  Good, but not great.  The OG location in Tucson is/was better.  My dog came with a bacon wrapped frank, beans, onions, tomatoes, mustard and a jalapeno type sauce.  All of this is stuffed inside a super soft bun.  They use a cheap hot dog which detracts from this being a great dog.  I did really like the bun and the onions (grilled and nice and sweet!).  The beans surprisingly work really well, too.  I may just shoot for a dog with onions, mustard and jalapeno sauce next time though.  While technically this wouldn't then be a \"Sonoran Dog\", I think I would enjoy it a bit more.  I'm usually a plain jane type guy when it comes to my dogs (mustard, onion and sometimes relish).  I ate my dog pretty quick, and was out of there.

Overall, it was A-OK.  I have another/better Sonoran Dog spot in Phoenix already that I would hit up before coming back here, but if I was down in this neighborhood and a Sonoran Dog craving hit, I would come back.  Service was much friendlier this time and the price is fair.  If all these Sonoran dog places could start using a good hot dog (Nathans, Hebrew National etc), they would be much better than they already are!  If I ran the place, Tim's Sonoran Dog stand would definitely use a higher quality dog ;-). Maybe I'll take that idea to Shark Tank and see if Mark Cuban will partner with me to get higher quality dogs in these joints.  A man can dream, right?"}
{"text":"Place is excellent, if you're not a vegetarian. They are known for there Sonoran Dogs which are fantastic. Burritos are good, like the cabbage, but Sonoran Dogs are there specialty."}
{"text":"I like this place. Parked behind it on a job walk last year and decided to go for it. Have been back about 6 times and never disappointed. It's all about the Sonoran Dogs. The pictures say it all.  When I first entered the restaurant it reminded me of a huge food truck. You wait in line,  you order your food,   they call your number and you pick it up. Great selection on the salsa bar including roasted chili peppers. The  carne asada was also very tasty but its all about the Sonoran Dogs. Generous portions and daily specials. Guess I will have to try the Orange Bang people are talking about."}
{"text":"Great wieners! Meat wrapped around other meat and I ain't talking about dry docking, this is salty bacon wrapped moistly around a stick of unknown processed meat that's cooked perfectly and topped with toppings completely different than a ballpark dog, oh they have meat discs as well that are amazing. Get a face full of meat at El Güero Canelo"}
{"text":"Wow, I've never had a Sonoran style hotdog before today and I couldn't believe how good it was. One was enough for me and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unusual, I'll give it that. this is not what one is used to when it comes to traditional Mexican (street)food...however....its not bad at all and then some!
They had all kind of fanangled stuff I'm not used to so I stuck to the basics: Carne asada burrito, oh...I ordered a large, what a mistake, that is not a large, its HUGE, no human can possibly finish that monstrosity, its over a foot long and over 3 inches in diameter. pure evil.
Bottom line, I'll love to come back and try some of the other offerings. good stuff here."}
{"text":"Not the best place to eat dirty. No es el mejor lugar para comer Susio para enpesar no ay mucho de donde escojer beef or chicken y k no tenian chicken. Las salsas sin savor creo k yo k no cosino me salen mejor k Esa basura x mas sal y Limon k le eche nada mas no la pagan !!! Jamas Los recomendaria"}
{"text":"The prices are decent... The salsa bar was good probably one of the better salsa bars I've come across. I didn't try the Sonoran dog but I had a Caramelo which wasn't bad wasn't anything to rave about IMO. My son had a bean and cheese burrito and he was a little puzzled that they weren't smashed beans but they were flavorful and he enjoyed it. It was clean, spacious, portions were good... Guess I'll have to try the Sonoran dog next time to see the big deal."}
{"text":"I always get a Sonoran hotdog and two carne Asada tacos and I'm never disappointed. Lived in Tucson and discovered this place there and it tastes the same in Phoenix! So good!"}
{"text":"Torn I want to give 4 stars but...my burro actually had too much meat. I know, I know. I actually like the cabbage, beans and cheese that is supposed to accompany the carne. The salsa bar is excellent. Fresh salsa, pico, avocado cream plus pickled onions, cucmbers and radishes, roasted jalapenos and onions. And..everything you need if you dont finish, which we didn't. Foil to wrap and bags for all of the plastic salsa containers.

The menu is limited to Sonoran dogs, burritos, tacos and tortas. This is not like a Berto Brothers restaurant. 

Overall it was a good meal and the young girl at the order counter was awesome. The best thing is they have Orange Bang. Orange Bang tastes like a Orange Julius but you get free refills. That alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Opening day at El Guero Canelo September 1, 2015.

Located at an old Discount Tire Store transformed nicely into a restaurant still with the roll up doors. 

All I had today was the Sammy Dog - the double dog wrapped in bacon, just as good as the original in Tucson or on Oracle. 

I understand it was the first day and will give the staff a break.

Will be back again for the Carne Asada Burrito and Tacos."}
