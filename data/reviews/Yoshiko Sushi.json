{"text":"Yoshiko is incredibly delicious! The food was at our table almost instantly and was hot and fresh it rates as well as Riz and the price is as cheap as it gets."}
{"text":"Fresh food, good service, not very crowded, free parking, what else do we need??"}
{"text":"My beh hates it here. Chicken skewer was pretty good tho. Squid skewer was pretty scary .& horrible. Rolls were mediocre, fish was sub-par. Drinks were cold and fresh but canned.. How lame. Not coming back here.."}
{"text":"OMG best sushi ever. We go here all the time when craving some raw fish.
It is always very fresh and clean there, which is important.
Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. Fresh fish, good service, good rolls... It was a hidden gem in Thornhill.

Now the quality of food (fish mostly) has gone down sooo much I refuse to go again. Was so disappointed how terrible it got I had to sign up on yelp and leave a review."}
{"text":"The sushi here was pretty good, the rolls are creative and tasty. They have quite a few non-sushi options such as french fries (which the waitress informed us were from Costco).

My big issue with this place is the service. They were unfriendly to the point of seeming angry that they had customers. We just decided to ignore it and enjoy our meal. Until the waitress very loudly came to clear some dishes and ended up spilling an entire bowl of Tempura Sauce all over me. That changed the mood of the service instantly, all of a sudden they were kind and rushing towards us with towels and napkins. Unfortunately this was too late as the sauce had destroyed my light leather boots and the stickiness was everywhere all over my clothes and legs. I went to the washroom to clean up and they had brought the check. Now we didn't expect them to comp the entire check, but we had ordered drinks and had at least expected them to comp the drinks or pickup my dry cleaning. When we spoke to them about this, they said I can leave my boots with them or go home, grab shoes, and drop the boots off the same night for them to get them dry cleaned themselves. They wouldn't reimburse me to have it dry-cleaned I had to hand over my boots to them, I had no intention of leaving my boots with them and hoping that they wouldn't steal them or try to wash them themselves in a sink to save on the dry-cleaning.

The way we were treated at this place was awful. I couldn't believe that they were extremely negligent and had spilled all over me and then expected me to hand my boots over rather than comping part of the meal? 

This experience put an awful taste in my mouth. The customer service was atrocious and it reflected on how the business was run, if they refused to skimp on the dry-cleaning by either reimbursing me to get it dry-cleaned myself or by comping part of our meal, where else are they skimping on?"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy maki set. It came with 18 pieces of sushi, miso soup and a salad for 13$. The sushi was really good and the waitress refilled our waters as they were approaching empty which was a nice gesture. I'd definitely go back. 

They have all you can eat as well as takeout/delivery options."}
{"text":"KEEP IN MIND THIS COMMENT SHOWS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE HERE AND THEN MY MOST RECENT AS YOU KEEP READING. THANKS. THIS COMMENT NDXT IS FROM 2015 : Best sushi. Most authentic in taste. Wonton soup is so flavourful. Sushi is fresh, cool in temperature. Very delicious! Only thing that I would suggest they work on, is their green tea. It is not very tea like and more like just hot water. But this place is by far my fav sushi place to go. 5 star. THIS IS AN MY OLD COMMENT FROM 2015! 

THIS IS NOW MY NEWEST REVIEW AFTER MY LAST TIME AT THIS RESTAURANT:
My most recent visit was horrible. The tea was just hot water again. Not real tea. But this time, we all paid the 11 of us & they said we did not fully pay. That one person did not pay. Yet this is obviously not true. We waited for 20 minutes just for them to keep arguing us when all they needed to do was check their receipts! Really left a sour taste in my mouth.. dissatisfied completely and because of the way they accused us of not paying, I was so uncomfortable and now do not want to go back. Such a shame."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat this place is great, never dissapointed here. Good selection and fresh sea food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for solid all-you-can-eat sushi with tasty non-sushi dishes included. The grilled shrimp skewers, General Tso's Tofu for the veggie types and omnivores alike, and the sesame chicken come to mind as particularly yummy.
The decor is nothing special, but comfy, the food is quite good, and the service is always pleasant enough, even when crabby locals are trying to take advantage.
Nothing mind-blowing here, just better food then the majority of your all-you-can-eat sushi joints, though certainly not up to the standards of the very best. (See: Matsuda)
For me it's a great place to grab lunch, not usually crowded at all, a good selection of food, and quick service, too.
Nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Everytime I check out a new AYCE establishment I get a Deja Vu feeling. Not in this one though.

Quality of sushis and makis are better than what you find at other AYCE locations. Menu is clear and is written in simple English which is handy for those who are not very familiar with Japanese terms.

This establishment also has chicken wings, calamari, french fries, and onion rings and they were all surprisingly delicious, making it perfect for times where your whole crew wants to go for sushi with the exception of this one person who doesn't like raw fish. Drinks are included.

Place is clean & spacey. Great service. Free WiFi. Surely worth checking out."}
{"text":"If you ever just crave a large quantity of sushi, this place is great! Never too crowded and the food quality is pretty good! 

Rates are average. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Recently, I found a Facebook page for small businesses against yelp. I read the comments and thought: well, yes, there are reviews which are offensive and others stunning to the business owners. This depends on how customers feel in a business world of getting the most out of your moola...and time...well, commitment...to try their devices. So, in my review of this sushi place, it's only a 3.5 star. I liked the service, the woman as fast, answered my questions, recommended some items, but the selection itself is lacking. There are \"special\" rolls, but nothing I can't find somewhere else (e.g., dynamite roll with salmon or white tuna on top). 

The lunch ayce price was $14 something plus tax, and I guess that is the norm in the area? 168 sushi is similar in price but the selection is more, I read. I think if it's your first few times trying out sushi, then this is a good place to start. I love raw fish in the maki, so if that's not your thing, come here. Again, it is not good or bad. Just my taste and preference give this sushi joint it's rating. 

The seating and environment is just fine, so come and relax. Eat your sushi."}
{"text":"RAW CHICKEN! I ordered takeout through skip the dishes ordered the maki chicken roll and when I got it it was raw! I called and spoke to a woman about it and she said I have to call you back and hung up AND NEVER called me back lol it was quite disappointing. It was my first order and my very last. Terrible customer service and food quality willl catch up to you. I mean mistakes happen people are human but atleast have good customer service and deliver a new order fresh.  Photo attached of chicken I found inside the chicken maki roll that I caught onto, thank god."}
{"text":"Quite good! The rolls are well presented, there's a fairly decent variety to choose from, and no issues with service, although it can be a bit slow, and occasionally they'll forget some rolls. For the price, a good deal. Kenkou (further East along Steeles) is better value, but the quality and selection doesn't compare."}
{"text":"It was just fine, but not good. 
The sashimi we ordered were a bit tasteless (maybe not very fresh?), but the rolls had too much mayo and ingredients and didn't go together imho. Pretty cheap though, I think we paid less than 20 per person, which explains the low quality. I'd go somewhere else, unless you're really low on cash."}
{"text":"3.5*, it's alright for AYCE.  Smaller restaurant with less than a dozen tables, including booths.  Little to no atmosphere.

Contrary to the other reviewer(s), I didn't have a problem with the service during an AYCE dinner.  The younger girl was especially patient and always refilling out tea.  No rudeness experienced.

Their strength is in their maki rolls, hand rolls were also ok.  A bit too much rice, but fine.  Sashimi was mediocre, stick to salmon as it has a higher turn-over rate.  I'd steer clear of the fried, non-tempura items, as they were a waste of stomach space!  ;)

Tip:  They still have 10% off if you pay in cash, but apparently you need a coupon which is on their takeout menu.  After we received our bill, we told them we were paying cash, and that's when we found out about the \"coupon\".  However, the mid-aged lady made an exception for us."}
{"text":"We visited yesterday, but we had a bad dinner time due to terrible service. Women who is owner has a bad attitude for customer.  She skipped our order three times, so we just let her know what we ordered but never said sorry and she told us \" if you guys have any leftover food, we will charge for that! \" like this...I was very embarrass. We just ordered couple of dishes for 30min. We felt she was trying to control our order with skipping. 

When we request skipped order, she just said \" I don't know'.  Never say \" let me check\" or \"Sorry\". If the women who took our order doesn't know out order, who will know that? 

I usually recommend this sushi restaurant to my friends. Even yesterday. From now, I won't do that anymore. 

The quality food and service are going to bad now. 

Moreover, when one of my friend pay the bill, she touched my friend's hand with card machine. She said nothing. 

I can not believe she is owner of restaurant.
When we went home, I had to say sorry to my friend instead of the owner."}
{"text":"Go here often with my best friend. We're big sushi fanatics. This place amazes me every time we go. Fresh sashimi, beautifully made sushi maki and the appetizers are amazing. Love the shrimp skewers and edamame!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge AYCE fan because I tend to over eat but I'll make an exception any day for Yoshiko. Tried it for the first time about 3 years ago with a friend. My family and I used to have this one sushi place we always went to but as soon as I introduced them to Yoshiko it became our main place. I'm obsessed with their spicy crab rolls and constantly crave them. Nobody else makes them the same. If you go make sure to order them!!! Also the kani salad is delicious. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch AYCE on a weekend.14.99+2.00 The sushi was pretty good. No fishy smell and good ratio to rice. The rolls were made pretty good even though it lacked selection. Some were fillers though like the Pinky Lady Roll. The kitchen food were really good though. I have to give props to their beef ribs and cheese wontons, one of the best I've had in ayce sushi. Beef ribs were well marinated, big slices and were tender. They also had Tom yum soup which was not bad considering it was ayce. Overall a decent experience 7/10"}
