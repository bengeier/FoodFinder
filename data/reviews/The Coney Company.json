{"text":"So good. Very cheap, awesome service. Detroit style coneys that are actual coney dogs. Unlike the so called coneys at other joints around town. The wing dings were tasty, the fries were awesome, the gyro was great. Quick counter service. The prices are cheaper and the food quality scores way above any fast food place I can think of. I am super stoked to have a place nearby that I can get a legit Michigan style coney."}
{"text":"Best coney sauce ever! If you want an all beef hotdog, go for the 99 cent add on to the regular coney. Will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Love the variety in the menu. Couldn't decide on one thing so I got breakfast and a dog. The McDowell breakfast sandwich is the tastiest thing I've ever had for breakfast."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and it was great.  The location is a little funky due the road construction & the fact that the place used to have a drive through window/lane but it was very clean and the woman at the counter was very nice.  I ordered two Coney Dogs & a small soda all for under $5!  The dogs were great with the snap of a natural casing, chili was perfect, nice cut on the onions and the mustard was a nice surprise.  I saw another customer's order of a burger & fries and it looked very good as well.
I will definitely be back, thanks!"}
{"text":"The employee through the drive-thru seem to be rude and wanted to rush me as if she did not want to take care of me when I got my food I asked for a chili dog and a coney dog and I end up getting two Coney dogs the hot dogs were hard so when I bit into it it the whole hot dog decided it wanted to come out of the bun and be a mess all over me but the chili was amazing. also decided to try their hamburger the bun was amazing but the hamburger had no taste to it at all no seasoning whatsoever just a few small things would have changed the review from a 2 to a 4 the little bit of seasoning on the hamburger before you cook it don't cook the hot dog is long and make it hard on the grill and get some better employees that want to serve and enjoy their job"}
{"text":"Tried 2 Coney Dogs yesterday with Stadium Mustard.  Excellent!!  natural casing dogs had good snap and flavor.  Chili sauce was not too sweet or too spicy.  Very well balanced.  Fresh crunchy onions too.

Best dogs I've ever had in Cleveland area since moving here in '88."}
{"text":"Dined in on a friday night around dinner time, during their opening week of business.  Very impressive fast food restaurant in both concept and practice, with a varying menu and good execution. 

Wife had the signature coney, which was finished with a great beanless chili. The chili is very mild, allowing the natural casing dog to have it's day. I had the fresh cheeseburger, which is actually a small double. The melted cheese and burger patties made for a wonderfully soft sandwich that edges towards a steamed burger.
Homemade coleslaw was served cold and crisp- a really good slaw. Home made onion rings were lightly battered and crispy.  Hand cut french fries could be awesome, but ours were tepid and soft, having suffered from being in a styrafoam take out box even though we dined in. 

Great service from the owners and staff far outweighed the multiple 1st-week hiccups. We found no garbage cans inside the garbage receptacles in the foyer; I'm sure they'll fix this oversight in no time. Serving ALL the hot dishes in styrafoam leads to many items being too steamy or damp even when immediately eaten. Again, I suspect the owners will make adjustments to the food packaging. The glaring issues are all things that anyone capable of such a great concept will quickly see for themselves. 

The Coney Company is a excellent addition to the downtown Old Brooklyn neighborhood.

edit: not a 24 hr restaurant"}
{"text":"Where else can you go at 8 o'clock and get an omelette in a drive thru with a bacon wrapped, deep fried, hot dog with cheese sauce and jalape√±os on the side? Yeah, that's what I thought."}
{"text":"Really good American food. No need to cook out, just head here. Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean, large selection from the menu, food was very delicious! Hope to see this chain take off!"}
{"text":"Hands-down best place I've eating in a long time. From the time I walked though the door, till the time we left. It was a Great dining experience, very clean and welcomeing. The food there was awesome and good pricing. The best part is there only 3min from the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. Definitely going to be a new tradition."}
{"text":"Their hot dogs are great.  You get a ton of fries. I had to ask to make sure they didn't give me a super order or something. And the fried bologna sandwich is good."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, I really do. I've been here twice now and have ordered the same thing both times-- 3 hot dogs, fries and a side of cheese. The fries were better than average and fresh-cut (something I love from hot dog places). The cheese had pretty good flavor and my hot dog bun was soft and tasty. The service was good and everyone seemed friendly. My issue with this place is the hot dog. Each time I've had one the hot dog had a great deal of toughness to it. At first I thought the hot dog was just overlooked or burnt but the menu/site claims that \"all-natural casing\" is used on the hot dog and maybe that's what the problem is. Either way, I don't enjoy tough dogs and when your name is Coney Company, your dogs should be the meter of your success. Not sure if I'll give them a third chance or turn my hot dog addiction elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that these are authentic Detroit style coney dogs!  They have many different styles dogs as well.  Staff was very nice too.  They do have this place set up like a fast food restaurant which is a bit different then I was expecting.  They also serve fresh cut fries which is a little different from a traditional Detroit restaurant, but they tasted great and they give you a ton of them.  Very happy to have a place in Cleveland to fill my coney craving.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The best coney sauce ever!! So happy I found this hot dog joint and have already gone back again. If you order the side of fries you will need to have a few friends nearby to help dig in. Awesome place."}
{"text":"Awesome spot and just what that area needed. Great breakfast and killer hotdogs. The bacon wrapped deep fried dog is a must. 

Finally a place to get a real hotdog close to home. It's clean, the people are friendly and good food. Check this place out!"}

The Coney Company. It's a hotdog and hamburger joint in Old Brooklyn. Strike that. It's a hotdog, hamburger, soup & salad, pita, sandwich, breakfast and snack joint in Old Brooklyn. Judging The Coney Company by its name would be like calling the Mona Lisa a painting of some chick. Sure, they've got your coney covered. You can get the traditional coney - a hotdog on a fluffy whitebread bun topped with chili, mustard and onions - or you can spring for their top-of-the-line bacon-wrapped, deep-fried dog topped with cheese sauce and jalapenos. But it doesn't stop at dogs.

As I mentioned earlier, The Coney Company has what I'd consider an expansive menu for such a humble eatery. It spans breakfast, lunch and dinner and every meal in between. I was perusing the menu and I came across a reuben, fish and chips, gyro, meatloaf, and a fried bologna sandwich. I won't spoil all of it for you, suffice it to say that if you're in the market for some simple, filling, made-to-order grub you will find it here.

On the eve of our visit, we decided to practice our own preaching by sticking with burgers and fries. Speaking of burgers, they are all ground fresh in house and made while you wait. No heat lamps or microwave ovens here folks. We got to see all the magic happen in their exposed kitchen. The burgers are offered in a nine different variations on the theme and a cheeseburger with the works - lettuce, tomato, onion, and the holy trinity of condiments - for $3.69. An order of their hand cut fries will set you back $1.99 and the order is big enough to feed a clan of Ooompa Loompas (or your average American couple). 

While we didn't eat in the establishment that night, that's not to say it was because it wasn't inviting. The dining room was clean, gleaming even, open and well-lit by the large windows across the front. They even have a drive-through, but we didn't experience that either. Back to the food.

The burger was as tasty, well-seasoned and as fresh as any that I've had. I'd even go as far as to say it rivaled some burgers I've paid more than three times as much for. But the fries, the fries are some of the best I've had. Starchy works of art served in a little paper bag. Crispy, not greasy, skin-on, perfection. I used to think that Five Guys fries were my favorite chain fries, but these may have edged them out.

Sure, it's not some fancy schmancy Wagyu beef burger on an artisan brioche roll topped with truffle compound butter and a slice of foie gras, but for about $10 it's dinner for two. You get one helluva tasty burger a la the 4th of July family picnics you may remember as a child and a bag of completely addictive fries. As if all that weren't enough to get your butt over to Old Brooklyn, you're also supporting a local Cleveland business. I think all of that's a pretty good deal.

After all that, why not 5 stars? Honestly, and you may feel this is on the nit picking side, but I found the burgers to be a bit overcooked. I know, I know, beating the guy up over a well-done burger that still tasted damn good, but I am a stickler about this. We'll definitely be back. Who knows, maybe I'll have softened by that time."}
{"text":"As a born and bred Old Brooklyner (Old Brooklynite?) I'm so proud to have this place in the neighborhood!

My mom and I both ordered dogs (The Coney & The Bacon Wrapped Fryer) and shared an order of the fries. I was so impressed by the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant. The prices were just right, too!

A must try on the O.B."}
{"text":"The ONLY ding against this place is they open WAY WAY WAY too late for breakfast. 9am, is 30 minutes before the rest of the restaurants on my commute stop selling breakfast. If I am to get breakfast here every morning they need to open by 8am. 7am would be better."}
{"text":"Built into an old Burger Chef you say? Something like that. Cleveland's only Coney Island launched to pretty good success last year and they are pretty good. The coney island is a chili dog dog made from beef hearts and spices, topped with onions and mustard. The dog is an all natural casing Vienna Style frank. It was invented in Jackson, MI in the early twentieth century by Greek immigrants and brought to New York briefly to Coney Island. It did well enough to catch the eyes of two Greek guys from Detroit, modified and marketed to explosive popularity. (See review for American Coney Island,  Detroit) Coney Company is comparable to anything in Detroit only not quite as busy. With the right promotion, that will change. Location is smack dab in the middle of Old Brooklyn. Coney's are $1.79 but you can combo is for an extra $ 2.79. I did not know that because the sign is posted on a side wall. Very, very clean and sparkling outside and in. Prices are reasonable. They serve breakfast for 2.99 and open at 9. They took advantage of the city Storefront Renovation Program so the design is done refreshingly vibrant with a tad retro. Open 9-9 daily."}
{"text":"I come here every week after I get a haircut across the street. Great dogs, quick sercice, cheap prices. Just a little hidden gem located down near the zoo. Good oldies playing while you dine, 2 tvs and huge windows if you need something else to look at besides the delicious food. Just come her and eat.... support local business! !"}
{"text":"Really, really, really good fast food by a small, family run business. The place is incredibly clean and I haven't had anything off the menu I haven't loved."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place a couple of times and had started writing up a review, but it was really long and I just really wanted to like this place so I put a hold on the review and planned to try The Coney Company one more time. But the place closed in September and I completely understand why. The coney sauce was very good, but that's it. I tried a variety of things off the menu and they were just meh. Always sad when a family run business closes, but I'm not going to miss this one."}
{"text":"The Coney Company is a 5 star restaurant with awesome food and service! They have a huge menu selection of options that makes for happy eating times. I tried the Gyro which was the best gyro I've had with homemade Tzatziki sauce. The Reuben is also a must try. The Mac N' Cheese Bites make a great cheesy snack. If you love dessert, then you have to try the Funnel Fries. And breakfast is served all day! The McDowell breakfast sandwich rocks. I will be back here many more times to try out the rest of the options."}
{"text":"I am not a hot dog connoisseur. Yes, hot dog connoisseurs exist. Friend wears the badge with honor and dogged determination (pun unintended) to consume a hot dog whenever one is spotted on a menu. On the other hand, I could count the number of times I have enjoyed a hot dog on one hand - a pilgrimage to Gray's Papaya with aforementioned friend, that one (very hungry) time at Costco, a stop at a Chicago style dog vendor...in San Diego, and my first and only trip to The Happy Dog.
Let me tell you that the Coney Company changed that. Every item sampled from the extensive menu is delicious! Even the food with cheese sauce/American cheese on it (there's a backstory involving Florida, a 7 eleven breakfast sandwich and a fishing charter behind that statement). We have been back several times and favorites are as follows: 
1) Loose burger
2) Chili cheese fries
3) Coney dog
4) Cinnamon roll pancakes
5) Mac n cheese bites
We have yet to order anything that doesn't elicit a 'grrr...mine...all mine!' reaction. The menu is extensive with something for everyone including superman ice cream!
The sister-brother entrepreneur team has done a fabulous job with what used to be an Arby's. Additions like a counter made with reclaimed wood from Coney Island's old boardwalk and a string art piece on one of the walls turned what could have been a very drab location into a (retro) cool space. You order and pick food up from the counter which means you get your food super quick. The prices are extremely reasonable. The most we have spent during our many visits is $13. 
So after all of that, if you still need an excuse to go - the zoo is just down the road!  Plan a trip to the zoo, and a stop at the Coney Company before/after. My recommendation - invest in a zoo membership because once you eat at the Coney Company, you may find yourself making plans to visit the zoo often ie every week."}
{"text":"Best place in the Cleveland area to get hot dogs. Nachos made with Doritos are just as tastey as they sound and the service and staff is terrific.

Breakfast served all day is also wonderful. Although they do have breakfast sandwiches it is not fast food type breakfast but the kind of diner breakfast that is usually enjoyed on a easygoing Saturday morning or a late late night. Omelettes and hashbrown are great. 

Full menu is served from open till close so you could have pancakes & bacon for dinner or a Coney dog & onion rings for breakfast. That's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Had the bacon cheeseburger last night -- amazing. Usually I have to travel to Rocky River or Lakewood to get food like this, but the Coney Company is right in my neighborhood, which is dangerous for my waistline  :D

Definitely worth checking out -- they have a drive-through and serve breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"A gem for fast food in old Brooklyn. Great kids meal items too! The food quality is way better compared to other fast food places. Fries are probably the best around too! If you are looking for a quick place check them out!"}
{"text":"Business is CLOSED.

Yelp won't publish the three word review so I'll reiterate: It's closed."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new place for me but I been ordering something new off the menu each time I visit I haven't found anything I dint like so far prices are great and the service is pretty fast and clean. My last order was a gyro OMG! It was beyond my expectations! I haven't had a gyro that good in a while my #1 dish so far!"}
{"text":"Great drive thru option for fresh homemade fast food. Burgers and cheese fries are a must!"}
{"text":"It's hard to not be jealous of these guys, introducing Detroit style Coney Island hot dogs to Cleveland.  As  I hail from the \"D\", I was really looking forward to seeing if they actually got it right.

They did....really truly did.

Except for the lack of a loud Greek guy yelling from the line, the food at the The Coney Company is true to form.  They use a local (Detroit) chili company, and have the authentic natural casing hot dogs.  They offer all the favorites like a \"loose coney\"  and \"coney taco\".  The dogs were cooked perfectly, toppings perfect, and the buns sealed the deal.  

This is a family run joint, and they were there, with great service.  It's clean, easy to find, and very affordable. 

Support local business and keep Detroit chili in the CLE!!"}
