{"text":"One of the best smoked meat sandwiches I have ever eaten. We were in Montreal for 4 days and came twice we loved it so much.  Atmosphere isn't great but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"You ain't experienced all of Montreal until you have smoked meat. Us Yankees call if brisket but it sure is good. You can ask for lean or fatty. I chose fatty as I gave up watching my waist line years ago. Solid tavern. Server was helpful and quick. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent, tout est bon, j'ai essayer la spécialité smocked meat, et j'ai même pu avoir une double part gratuitement. J'ai essayer la bière locale aussi. Enfin bref, tout était délicieux. Je recommande vivement!"}
{"text":"Menu intéressant pour un lunch avec un petit twist : spécialisé en smoked meat, plusieurs variantes originales de poutines et un choix recherché de burgers (au caribou, au wapiti, au kangourou, à l'autruche). J'ai essayé le burger au wapiti, c'était très bien. La serveuse nous a dit que les viandes changeaient régulièrement et qu'elle n'avait, personnellement, pas beaucoup aimé le burger au crocodile. Sympathique et amusant."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.... let's start at the bottom... the best decor in the restaurant is actually the bathrooms, downstairs. On the other hand they smelled so badly of chlorine and harsh lighting that you wouldn't want to stay there for long in any case. A canned soft drink will cost you over $3. The smoked meat was dry. The chocolate cake was frozen. The service was lacklustre, to be kind about it. I have been craving a good steak for a while and well... I'm still craving one after having eaten a steak here, they dumped spices on it and yet didn't bother to season it. The steak platter was served without a steak knife and it really did need a steak knife. The fries were soggy. The salad dressing was overly sour.   Funny part, I was looking forward to coming here because it is one of the few places in town that serves many different types of burgers, including boar, elk, horse and kangaroo. The menu is all over the place. And the drinks... strip club prices!"}
{"text":"I went there with the use of a Groupon coupon and it was just so-so, the portions were small, the service totally unorganized despite it being a dead night. I did not leave a 15% tip to the supposed $79 value (ridiculous) it was unmerited.  The location was bright and spacious but over-priced for what you got."}
{"text":"Visited this joint over the Summer and three stars is being generous. Very strange menu, spotty service. Poutine was nasty.   We were the only people in there yet our waitress went to take a smoke break so we sat there waiting for her to return so we could get our check and get out of there.   They had some weird nature program on the TV with a guy skinning a snake which seemed to go well with their odd burger menu. That seemed to be about the only animal that was missing from it.. Would not recommend this place unless you're a starving carnivore."}
{"text":"We were looking for a convenient place to go and found this place. The smoked  meat was quite good and the rye was fresh. The fresh cut fries were well cooked and very tasty. There are many varieties of poutine as well and I'm sure with the quality of the fries they would be good. The bison burger was quite good and we'll prepared. The only negative were the portions of fries which could have been more generous"}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich. The meat was fine. The bread was dry. I didn't love the sauerkraut. They only had yellow mustard, which is not my favorite. There were plastic menus that were used as placemats. Or the placemats were plastic menus. Yuck. The place just seemed unclean to me."}
{"text":"This place is in a nice location and we sat outside in the patio area. The food was okay, as other reviewers have said, nothing special. There were four people in our party. One (15 yr old) asked about pizza as there was a large colorful sign advertising the pizza (yes, at a brisket place). We were told they were out of dough for the night and could not make anymore pizza. She changed her order to salad. The other three of us all ordered brisket sandwiches. After a looooooong wait, the waiter brought out 2 brisket sandwiches and no dinner for my husband. He said \"oh sorry, I misunderstood\" - then came back a few minutes later and said they were now out of brisket and he would have to order something else. The place seemed very disorganized and the food was just mediocre. There are plenty of better options in the area."}
{"text":"Ha les joies de travailler au Centre-Ville. On découvre des perles à tout les jours. Ok, ce n'est pas de la haute gastronomie et d'accord on est pas chez Schwartz mais pour un amateur de smoked meat comme je le suis, désabusé des Dunn's et Reubens de ce monde, au Brisket Montréal, ils ont frappé dans le mille!!! Le fameux smoked meat est excellent, maigre quand on le demande maigre, savoureux et pas trop salé. On ajoute un service super efficace et sympathique et on a une recette gagnante pour les amateurs de plat typiquement montréalais."}
{"text":"Silly me I asked what kind of meat the sandwich was made with. Beef!  They offer lean, medium, and fatty. I got medium and it was tender and flavorful. The fries are not what I was used to (poutine style - dark and soggy) but good. I experimented and instead of a coke or root beer, I got and \"Emile\" a Soda made with  spruce oil. Interesting but not something I'd try again. Waitress was patient and helpful but a bit too busy to keep the glasses filled when a tour bus swamped them. Our dessert \"sugar pie\" was reminiscent of carmel. Super sweet!"}
{"text":"If Wayne still works there he was the best waiter ever and knew how to make a milkshake!!  Awesome service and great food I don't know why it doesn't have a higher rating.  This place was always Jammed pack almost impossible to get a seat.  Poutine, smoked meat , beer"}
{"text":"Well I got the name of this place wrong.  When we walked up I thought it was called Krausmann's.  Its actually called \"Brisket Montreal\" (Salon Kraussman).  We got there late on a Monday evening at about quarter to eight.  We asked if they were still serving food, and we were told that the kitchen was cutting off orders at eight, and the restaurant closed at nine.  Having walked past many closed restaurants we were down with that.  My wife and I both had the \"Best of\" special which featured Putine, two differents types of smoked meat (one was pork foot), cole slaw, and a pickle.  I forgot to write down what the kids were eating in my notebook - poor me.  The smoked meat was A-freaking-Mazing.  Awesome is too tame of a word to describe it.  The meat was so good that my 2 year old child was fighting my wife to eat her smoked meat.  The smoked pork foot meat was the better of the two, but I could have eaten either for days.  The poutine was the second best poutine that we had during this trip to Quebec.  The wait staff was nice to us.  My kids tried to use their french to the best of their ability, and the server worked with them.  Quite kind.  Our server visited us a few times so see how we were doing.  Salon Krausmann, I had never heard of you before, but you can bet that I'll be there next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Delicatessen, many types of club sandwich great onion rings !"}
{"text":"Well. My friends and I were in Montreal for the weekend and we wanted to find a cute little pub to eat at on our way to Old Port. We looked up this place and it had good reviews, was right on the walking route, so we stopped in. The five other people that I went with all had decent food, it wasn't amazing but it was still ok. My order however, came out pretty bad and there wasn't much of an effort to fix it by the staff. First, I ordered a drink, and the man told me he couldn't make that one for me \"just because\", upon him telling me, I tried looking at the drinks menu again, but most of it was in french with no english translation. I asked the waiter what else he had and he shrugged, so when I saw \"diet pepsi\" as the only familiar words, I ordered that. Next, my food came with the wrong side, in which the waiter did go back and fix. But I had requested the chicken sandwich I ordered to be made with no bacon, since I can't eat red meat. I told the man and he grumbled at me and took it to the back, clarifying \"no bacon right?\"I said yes. He came back out with absolutely nothing on the bun but a bare piece of chicken, and had stripped it of all the tomatoes, lettuce, onions, mushrooms, everything. At this point I was very upset, all of my friends were almost done with their meals, and I still was very polite in pointing out that he took everything else off. He shrugged and said they were all mixed together and there was nothing he could do. The chicken sandwich was also not that great. The poutine was good, but the meal was so messed up and the service was so bad that I won't go back."}
{"text":"Food Atmosphere Drinks  All very g ood!  Not to mention the service  Give it a go and try their smoked meat special :)"}
{"text":"Gave me roast beef, told me its \"Pulled Pork\".  You gotta be kidding me.  Stay away from this place.  There's no lost in translation here."}
{"text":"We literally stumbled across this place after looking for a restaurant for almost an hour, but I'm super glad we found it - everyone really enjoyed it.  It was very busy for lunchtime, I think because a hockey game was on television (we were in Canada). They also gave us apples from a local farm to take with us on the way out - nice touch!  The menu is pure insanity: there are like 15 types of animals (for burgers) and 10 different kinds of poutine to choose from. We really enjoyed the food, though it was a bit pricey for burgers ($10-15). I'd suggest this in a heartbeat to any visitor to Montreal."}
{"text":"Agréable restaurant,accueil chaleureux service rapide et efficace et effectivement on m'avait dit de goûter le Smoked meat,il s'agit de la pointe de la poitrine de buf et bien je ne suis pas déçu de ce repas à faire tranchement mais attention petite quantité donc pour les grands mangeur il faut recommandé."}
{"text":"Don't let the deli-like atmosphere fool you -- this poutine is the best moderately priced deal in the city!"}
{"text":"I went to Brisket after buying an online voucher that was 30$ for 100$ worth of food for two people. The deal seemed almost too good to be true as the feast consisted of fried mushroom starter, salad, smoked meat sampler, steak and potatoes, desert and a bottle of wine.  First impression walking in is that the place looks bigger than it is, very casual setting but the theme is a little bit all over the place. They had tv screens and ads promoting happy hour specials, almost like a sports bar, but the night we went, they had a jazz singer and band. I also don't understand their monkey mascot which is featured on their flyers and painted graffiti-like all over their bathroom doors.  The menu seems almost as scattered. They offer a big assortement of sandwiches and poutines and various meats ranging from kangaroo, boar, bison and beef.  With the set menu we were offered, I was pleased with the smoked meat but severely disappointed with my steak. It was overdone, dry and bland. Being one of their most expensive menu items, I expected more. I had to eat it with ketchup when a good cut of meat should be savory on its own.  For the deal I paid, I can't complain too much since it was only 30$ for 2 people (tips and taxes extra) although it isn't worth any more.  Brisket seems to be recommended by many tourist guides and websites. I can understand the initital attraction but I also see why they have trouble building return customers.  The service was excellent but food is left to be desired. There are better sports bars, diners or jazzy restaurants to go to - Brisket is trying too hard to be all that.  I would recommend for a simple lunch - but don't go expecting a fancy dinner."}
