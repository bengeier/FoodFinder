{"text":"I was happy to find this new place that opened in Yorkville.  It's located right across from Lettieri and we ended up here because Lettieri had no tables free for lunch.  We weren't sure if they offered food, but once we walked in, the bartender told us that they've only been open for 5 days (wow!) and that they have pizzas, paninis and salads.  The menu has a great selection of tasty pizzas and gourmet paninis.   We ordered and shared the Pizza Veneziana which was delicious!!  The dough was thin, well-cooked and fresh.  We sat at the bar facing the street which was great for people watching.  The decor is nice and the atmosphere is comfortable.  We didn't have espresso, but it looks like they would make great cappuccinos and lattes.  Prices are reasonable and this is a great place for a nice tasting lunch - not too heavy and high quality.  The owner has been in the Yorkville area for a long time operating another business, but he has now ventured into the restaurant business.  He has brought some cuisine learnings from different regions in Italy to Caffe Bacio.  He is very pleasant and came to chat with us to gauge our feelings about the food.  In my opinion, this is a sign of a good business owner and one who cares about his customers.    We had a great time at Caffe Bacio and we were happy to stumble upon this new place!  We also felt really great about supporting Toronto's independent business owners.  Something we should do a lot more of in the city :)"}
{"text":"This might as well be the best cafe in Yorkville. Coffees score good points from me, and their paninis are delicious. They are worth going back for. Coffees and foods are cheaper than other cafes in the neighbourhood. If you are considering to go Starbucks across the street, give this place a chance!"}
{"text":"From appearance with nothing much else in the room, you'd think Bacio must pull wicked espresso drinks.  I did, and I was wrong.  The (barista) must have had the shot extracting for over 2 minutes producing an something undrinkable.  I should've said something but with customers in the room I didn't want to embarrass anyone.  $3 wasted"}
{"text":"When I am in need of a simple, quick and fresh lunch, I always stop by Caffe Bacio for the bresaola panini or the trio salad combo (bresaola, prosciutto melon, and caprese). I'm craving a panini just thinking about Bacio! The pizzas are also freshly made and delicious, and you can't go wrong with the generous drizzles of truffle oil on most of the tasty brunch and lunch dishes on the menu!   Rahier treats and a full bar are a plus, as well as the lovely baristas and waitstaff.  My only complaint? Feeling kind of rushed and uneasy when I haven't ordered food and am enjoying my coffee at a table technically reserved for lunch patrons between the hours of 12 and 3. I generally move to the window to make room for paying customers and hurry on my way."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to cafe in yorkville. They make a great Americano, and can make it Irish if that's what floats ur boat. It has a very European feel and atmosphere here and very comfortable seating w booths and counter spots facing window onto the heart of yorkville. It is slightly pricey for food items but they're pretty good, and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place has very uneven reviews and my conclusion is that your perception may well depend on the time of day when you visit.  I don't blame them for the sounds of construction booming through the place, because that stuff happens and it will be temporary. And I don't blame them for the subway rumble under the restaurant because that's life in the city and part of having a great location right on the subway line.  But I do blame them for being a caffe (yes, a double f caffe!) that doesn't make good coffee drinks. Coffee drinks that must be sweetened to be drinkable. Coffee that is so overheated that it spoils the espresso and renders it, yes, undrinkable. But I don't rule out that we had an inexperienced (but very pleasant) barista and maybe there are others that are better.  And then to present a breakfast that is so lacklustre that I wish I had stayed at home and scrambled my own eggs and toasted my own toast. Breakfast out is supposed to be a treat and this was... ok.  So they get 2 stars because it's a pretty little space and when it isn't full with people whose conversation are bouncing off the walls and tables, in concert with the sound of drills, I can imagine it would be a nice place to come and have...pastry. The pastries looked really good."}
{"text":"Small but cute cafe; my tea latte was pretty tasteless but the prices were very reasonable. Did not have anything to eat...may try that the next time"}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place since it opened, and as I walked by it today, I had to go in and take a closer look at their sandwiches. Their sandwiches are definitely what you would expect to find in Yorkville area for it is truly a gourmet sandwich with the gorgeous presentation. I caved and decided to order their prosciutto mozzarella panini, it was a bit pricey at $13.50 but totally worth every penny. It was the perfect proportion of prosciutto to mozzarella, so there is no need to reach for your drink while you devour the entire sandwich. This is the perfect sandwich to eat out under the sun."}
{"text":"I've been past this place a few times and it was always busy so I figured there had to be something decent going on inside. We finally decided to try it out this weekend and I was very disappointed. We didn't have any of the food so I can't comment on that but if a place bills itself as a cafe it needs to have decent cafe.   I was immediately put off by the small sign on the counter when I walked in that said something to the effect that 'tables are for customers who order food only'. I absolutely hate signs like this in any type of establishment. This just irks me. I understand they are trying to run a business, but all customers should be welcome to sit. Why would the first thing you want your customers to see is that there is a hierarchy and that you value some more than others. It's true, business do value those that spend more than others who spend less, but why would you promptly advertise this in black and white? Make people feel welcome, not uneasy about finding the \"right\" spot to sit depending on what they ordered. In our case, as non-food-orderers, we were relegated to the stools by the window, which were quite nice and a perfect height for the beautiful counter top.  But about the cafe, we both ordered plain lattes and the foam was awful, it wasn't even approaching microfoam, it was just really really weak foam. We were both surprised when we saw this. I honestly can do better with my little Nespresso milk frothier/single serve espresso marker I have at home. It was a disappointing experience.   The location and ambiance are great, but the lattes didn't have enough to ever make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon of (window)shopping above my demographic.  Had a glass of white and the mushroom ravioli. Everything was very tasty, and the servers were very friendly.  The atmosphere was somewhat lacking though.  Might stop in again."}
{"text":"Nice new place in the area, and a good alternative to Lettieri across the street. I pleasantly surprised when I found out they offer paninis and breakfast food! They also have little cakes on the side. The cafe wasn't too crowded when I went, and the barista was very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Margarita Pizza ever since my last trip to Italy. This was the first time I had a thin crust pizza that was truly delicious and was really authentic Italian pizza just like served in Rome  There was just enough ingredients on this thing that made it like a pizza but the crust was just perfect, nothing like the pizzas that are soggy or too thick or too think or burnt, etc. definitely give it a try and you'll love it guaranteed.  Wish there was a place like this in LA! ."}
