{"text":"The food is very delicious it's almost like going to the danforth. The food is always fresh and the price is affordable. The only thing I recommend is that the cook wears a hat so I don't eat any hairs. This is good kitchen practice. Please were a hair piece or a hat."}
{"text":"Ever since the owner changed, this place is getting worse and worse. Their fries smells fishy... and I don't know where to start from with their burgers. I'd rather starve."}
{"text":"Great value. Breakfast items are solid and affordable. Souvlaki is a tad on the light side. I would recommend for brunch/breakfast more than anything but still good"}
{"text":"Greek salad = lettuce, 3 olives and 5 slices of tomatos spinach pie =   tastless, oily cost= $8      Save your money and your appetite and go somewhere where there's actual food"}
{"text":"We live a 2 minute walk from this place, so we were excited to see a greasy spoon this close to our place.  After a few days of unpacking, we went there to try the place out, and were pleasantly surprised.  I got chicken fingers and fries which, granted, is hard to screw up.  They were surprisingly good, and the portion was HUGE for the price.  Girlfriend got souvlaki (chicken, I think), which was good, but nothing to write home about.  Still, we were happy with our meal.  Since then, we've picked up breakfast a few times.  It's been a little hit-or-miss at times, especially the home fries the one time, but overall, quite tasty!  Definately a place we'll go to again or pick up from in the near future.  P/S, their onion rings were delightful.  I wasn't sure whether to give it 2 or 3 stars because we got some less-than-perfect meals, but the rings we got last Sunday alone made that extra star shine.  Besides, at $4.60 for breakfast, how can you go wrong? Not many places will get you a breakfast for the change in your pocket :)"}
{"text":"Emily is totally right - this place is a classic greasy spoon diner with a Greek twist.  If you want something cheap and greasy for a hangover breakfast, this is the place that will fix you up quick.  The breakfast special is $3 or $4 dollars, depending what time of day you show up, and it is exactly what the doctor ordered if you were partying hard last night.  In the warmer months you can even sit outside on their tiny cute patio!  The breakfast consists of eggs any style, bacon or sausage, toast, and homefries (which are spiced to the point where they are pretty much guaranteed to be at least partially comprised of last nights leftovers).  Get a cup of crap coffee and some juice and you've got the classic cure for what ails you.  They are also licensed if you need a little hair of the dog.    I have yet to have the pleasure of trying anything else at Billy's, the only time it occurs to me to go is when I need breakfast, stat, and it looks too crowded at Disgraceland.  Be warned that the crowd at Billy's tends to vary a lot as does the overall makeup of the neighborhood, but overall people are pretty friendly and the staff here will just as soon bounce someone if they are acting up."}
{"text":"I normally order for take-out.  Before the actually Billy sold the place it had great food, but after he sold it and when it was under new management or kitchen staff, it's not so great.  I had ordered a lamb dinner, after driving 15 minutes to the place to pick it up, drove another 15 minutes home, open the bag and look at my lamb, it was just one big piece of bone with hardly any meat on it.  I immediately called the place and the guy was all like \"No the piece has lots of meat on it\", after trying to convince him for the next 2 minutes, I finally told him I'm bringing it back.  Another 15 minute drive back to the restaurant, showed him the whole dinner and the piece of bone I got, he was a little shocked and said something to the other guy in another language I didn't understand, but probably something along the lines of how can you give this to a customer.  He apologized and gave me a real piece of lamb with actual meat on it.  So another 15 minute drive back home.  1 hour of driving to try and get a decent dinner!! :-(    I just got the feeling that perhaps they reserve the lamb with meat on it for dine-in customers and gave the bones to the take-out customers.  This is why I give this place 1 star. Since that experience I have not gone back!"}
{"text":"Disgusting place, food and the new owner. I ordered a chicken dinner and asked for all the sauces on the side. The owner calls me back and yells \"no sauces on side\" after going back and forth he agreed. I get my food and take it home, open it and there is hair mixed up with the salad! Just gross!! I took it back and demanded my 11$ back. He was mad at me? How it's not my fault? Then he gives me back the money and says he I Am never allowed to order from there Again! The owner of this is new, it used to be owned by Billy, the sweetest man ever! So sad what the new owner has done. I have been going here for many years. Please people spread the word and don't ever go here! It's not sanitary!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mais c'est pas mal du tout ! Le rapport qualité prix est excellent. À emporter, sur commande ou sur place, c'est un restaurant style grec de quartier qui est parfaitement respectable. On y travaille dur, très dur et les classiques du Gyro à la salade grecque sont parfaitement agréables."}
{"text":"Good bang for your buck for all day breakfast. I could swear by the pea meal on a kaiser with egg and cheese, with a side of sausage.  The service could be better, but i've never been there and seen the same waitress twice. Must be a  high rate of turnover.   Great that they deliver too."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this restaurant.  It smells unpleasant inside and the vibe is kind of sketchy.  Their food does not seem to be of great quality either."}
{"text":"Best greasy-spoon breakfast for less than 5 bucks anywhere.  Seriously.  Huge servings, very fresh, very tasty. 2 eggs, 2 sausages or bacon, hash browns, and toast for $4.25.    The burgers are reliably decent.  Surprisingly, however, given the name, the souvlaki is not awesome."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast today. Service was fast and food came fast. Not sure where they get off charging $.75 for a refill on coffee... Also, I felt very ill after so I think there was something wrong with the food. Maybe it had been sitting out? And that's why it was so fast? Questionable..."}
{"text":"A good greasy breakfast is a sure-fire fix for a hang over morning, right?...We've all been there at some time or another and for a greasy treat, Billy's Souvlaki Place will do the trick.    It's a true dive and good for the aforementioned. I hate to encourage cash-strapped students to eat poorly, but for a cheap meal, try it out. Some good choices are the $3 breakfast or the chicken souvlaki.   Find Billy's Souvlaki Place just south of the Bloor and Dovercourt corner."}
{"text":"Ordered Greek food from here for takeout and was not disappointed. Much bigger portion sizes compared to other Greek restaurants I've been too and a cheaper price too - can't beat that! Only complaint was that the food was a little greasy, and the restaurant itself definitely could use some renovations, but for the price I really can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Solid place for the price. If you want something special- there's a million little coffee shops and breakfast joints in Toronto that suit your needs. This definitely isn't gourmet, but you really get what you pay for. 10 bucks will carry you, any time of the day at this spot. This is a neighborhood institution and you really can't beat it for breakfast."}
{"text":"Briefly \"really bad\". Oily food very far from Greek cuisine. Quite surprised they are still in the business with the food quality and environment they provide. I guess the price still seems appealing for some individuals.."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place the only reason I'm only giving it 4 is cause the restaurant itself isn't the nicest to sit in! The staff have always been nice but it just feels very non-fresh and stale and def avoid the washrooms downstairs. But if you can sit out on the little patio that's always lovely! The food is ridicolously good, the fish & chips is the best I've had in Toronto and the breakfasts are amazing. And the best part is, you get a lot of food and it costs you next to nothing!!  If you're looking for GOOD food but not the looks, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I don't understand the reason behind the name for this place.    Not a hint of Greek other than souvlaki and gyros. Can't imagine then being authentic either.     You can always appreciate an all day breakfast though.    Ordered the typical sausage with eggs, toast, and french fries.    Meal was fine.  Nothing spectacular.    Couldn't help but listen to the manager or owner giving his employee a hard time in front of customers seated directly around the counter.  Hardly professional at all.  (He should have taken her aside... away from the customers) Not exactly the best defining moment when I finally get a chance to write this review months later.  Impeccable memory serves me well.   This place could use a paint job as well."}
{"text":"Hot Damn! Spoon Food to the rescue.  I had a delicious breakfast! It was busy, but our good came out in about three minutes. We all sort of had an alteration one way or another with our breakfasts and everything was perfect, as ordered, hot.  The photos on Google do it justice.  The décor is basic blue, lots of windows - Greek Pride stylez. The bathroom was extremely clean and well stocked.  The food was a show-stopper. Pair this delicious food, speed, and accuracy with a super affordable price and that's Billy's Souvlaki.  Super bonus - They have a full on bar, think Greek Breskfast & beer or your favorite stiff pleasure. So stiff.  Oh I forgot to talk about the coffee. It was absolutely flavorful, strong and hot. They had sweetner on the table, I am hot for that. Bathroom/Basement style, just a heads up - HEADS Up! The ceiling is low in the bathroom but no big deal, just be safe if you are a tree trunk like me."}
{"text":"Greasy Greasy Greasy.  Yum Yum Yum.  Jingle Jingle Jingle. That's the sound of the money I saved by directing my hunger pangs to their $5 all-day-brekkie plate.    Keep in mind if you come here with more than 4 people, they will not be able to handle it and your food will come out one ill-timed side dish at a time. Do NOT come here for breakfast with more than 4 people. 4 is the absolute limit.   Not a place I'd go out of my way for, but definitely a place I am very grateful to have across the street!"}
{"text":"Billy's Souvlaki is a Greek greasy spoon restaurant located on Dovercourt.  The restaurant is physically accessible but the bathroom is located in the basement and is not accessible.  To be honest, it was pretty gross so I don't remember if it was gendered or not.  It was so gross I ran away.  But that's kind of to be expected at greasy spoons.  Anyways, this place is \"famous/infamous\" for their breakfast special.  My spouse hates it, but I think it's great.  They also offer really great, cheap, take-out style Greek food.  As a Montrealer, this is more akin to what I grew up with, rather than Danforth style Greek, so I'm thrilled I found this place.  I mean, the Souvlaki isn't magical but it's good IF you like greasy spoon style food.  I do.  They make a mean, cheap, grilled cheese.  Overall, their menu is VERY reasonably priced, which is a big factor in my love of greasy spoons.    I love this place."}
{"text":"I confess: I have an obsession with Billy's Greek salad. Mounds of feta and onions top a plate of no-frills lettuce. It is a simple but delicious staple of the small Dovercourt souvlaki place that sits just shy of Bloor - and one of the main reasons I continue to go back time and time again.  I first discovered Billy's when I lived in the Bloor/Ossington area years ago. It has since become a regular go-to for cheap brunch and eats. I almost always go for the breakfast with a salad - but honestly the homefries are pretty awesome too. It's super affordable and a good greasy spoon for your hangovers.  PROS - Prompt service and food arrives quick - Cute patio during the summer - Cheap (though limited) drinks - Surprisingly filling - Delivery  CONS - Decor is virtually nonexistent, but if you're lucky you can sometimes catch soccer games and old MuchMusic movies on the TV - Chicken souvlaki skewers weren't anything special  Billy's deserves more stars considering how often I go there, but it is what it is. Delicious, cheap and simple."}
{"text":"Gord is a big fan of breakfast.  This morning we had breakfast at Billy's Souvlaki Place.   It's been a while since we've been there.  I ordered ham and eggs and Gord ordered bacon and eggs ... they were good!  It's not fancy but it's a great spot for breakfast.  You get a lot of food and the price is cheap.    As a head's up, they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Billy's chicken souvlaki dinner comes with a creamy onion-heavy salad, saucy rice, and a tender juicy skewer of meat. The breakfast special is unbelievably cheap and does wonders for hangovers. Those are the only two things that my boyfriend (who has been a happy Billy's customer for years now) and I ever get and they keep us coming back.  In the summer time, the narrow sidewalk patio is a breath of fresh air from the dated interior. The basement washrooms are down-right dirty. I try to avoid using them as much as I can and would highly recommend holding your breath if you must make a trip down.  Billy's is cheap, quick, and consistent. Some days, that's all you really want."}
{"text":"Solid three for what it is, a greasy spoon with the best home fries around, at a great price.  Consistent.  Dave man's the grill like a champ.  Breaky special come out fast. Three eggs with loads of bacon/sausage vs other places. Yes coffee refills cost $0.75 but coffee is best I have had at a greasy spoon. $5.76 7/2017"}
{"text":"I'm frankly amazed at how many reviews here are actually of slouvlaki - as far as I understood, their 'thing' was to provide old men (and us) the company of fried eggs and CP24. And they are so good at that.  They don't refill coffee, but the coffee's not that good. So it evens out."}
{"text":"Not one but two microwaves in the kitchen..worse part is the \"chef\" used it to make the souvlaki dinner I ordered, yuck..only positive here was the service as the waitress was super friendly."}
{"text":"I'm giving Billy's 4 stars to even out the other reviews. It does what it does well. You aren't going to walk into a place like Billy's and expect fine dining.  Heres my inside tip: order the $4.95 breakfast and substitute a greek salad ($1) for the homefries (which are french fires), it's healthier and the greek salad is done right, good olives and feta, and fresh veg all for 6 bucks, done.  They've also recently replaced the enormous crappy rear-projection tv from 15 years ago with a shiny new Samsung 46in LCD, if you feel like watching the Olympics with your meal."}
{"text":"Okay. ...so this is the greasiest spoon around. The breakfast is everything you need in a breakfast after a late night or when you just can't be bothered to make breakfast. You don't get refills and need to request an extra jam, but it's like $4.00 before 10 am and $5 after.....come on! !! Also, never use the bathroom. Just don't."}
{"text":"I, like Hilary K, am very surprised at anyone who has actually had Souvlaki from Bill's Souvlaki House.  This place is a fairly ridiculous Halifax-styled Greek breakfast place. Greasy hands making greasy eggs, putting them on a clean-ish plate next to some processed meat, white toast and sub-par potato things. This is something I dig, but it's not for everyone.   Don't expect much, but if you're hungover and want to sit on a small patio and eat an all-day breakfast for UNDER FIVE BUCKS this is your place.    PEPPER POINTS: For being licensed.   PEPPER'S PISSED: About the horribly dirty bathroom, with a fan creating a hot wind-tunnel across from the door. What the front door is up with that?"}
