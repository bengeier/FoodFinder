{"text":"Formerly a strip joint (Cleveland PM), our server made a couple puns about entertainment and dancing. Loved that. And, when you are dining, if you look up, you can imagine how that all went down, based on the placement of the track lighting and spotlights. All stages, poles, and Champaign Rooms have been removed. The d√©cor is classy, in an Italian Designing Women sort of way, but if you know it was a strip club, you can't help but still get that \"Lido\" type vibe when you are inside. It has a huge patio and deck (seats 500 according to the website) but I am not sure if it is opened yet. The pastas are excellent, according to my co-diners. I ordered a salad and it was huge but really good. We all reported an overwhelming flavor of garlic.The sign declares that Philomena's Sunday Grand Brunch is the sister to that of M Bistro, the Westlake restaurant that closed in 2009. I'm not sure what makes brunches sisters, but I would suppose if you liked the M Bistro brunch, give Philamena's a try.   The owner takes advantage of the space and offers live music (including a Sinatra impersonator) a few nights a week."}
{"text":"Went here for a benefit dinner... I was so excited to see what could have possibly been a ''champagne room\" in the back - I was greeted with something better - a huge drain in the center of the dining room - it used to be the special ''shower room'' for the strippers & no doubt spectators. Absolutely hilarious in my opinion... you would think they might say, put a fountain there so it wasn't so obvious? Nope! The other drains around the floor were covered with heavy plastic board. Please don't get me wrong, this was by no means a bad experience. I only wished I had been able to visit when it was a gentlemen's establishment to see the transformation! They had $5 dollar Martinis, which were delicious! I had a raspberry 'Flirtini,' a orange-y tasting one (specially made for me), and a Vanilla & Chocolate martini that was divine. The pizza & pasta buffet was equally delicious. Their pizza sauce is just the right amount of sweet, and the cheese was bubbly and greasy - the way pizza should be! In the actual dining area there were patrons of all ages - all looking pleased with their choice. The interior of the restaurant is well laid out & decorated in a very modest and chic way. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My review is based on three visits...we have returned because the food is actually quite good; however, each visit  served up a different problem...all correctable in our view, but problems nonetheless.  On our first visit, we were told that they were overwhelmed due to a large crowd of 50 people celebrating something in the front of the house.  This was understandable, but being out of bread (in an establishment that bakes its own!) then waiting 45 minutes for our entrees took patience beyond ours, especially since we had ordered uncomplicated pasta dishes that should have been within the kitchen's capacity.  Due to their being admittedly overwhelmed, however, we did not complain. During our second visit, my pizza, ordered without cheese, came with, and then it took another 20 minutes to produce my correct order with no offer of any kind to compensate for the wait.  On our third visit, we were the ONLY patrons when we initially arrived, and one of our entrees was completely forgotten.  In addition, my salad, ordered without cheese and with just oil and vinegar on the side, came dressed with their Italian dressing (tasty, but containing cheese) and one of our guests who ordered a regular salad got the same thing I got...no cheese, but dressed with their cheesy dressing. They did produce cheese, however, when requested.  I decided to just ignore the salad because I did not feel like complaining at the time.  But when we reminded our server about the guest with no entree, he disappeared, only to return after everyone else was finished. We asked to have his order packed to go...and then were shocked to see it still on the bill. This time I asked if he really intended to charge us for the food that was delivered way too late to eat, and he did remove the item from the check, but acted as though he was doing us a great favor.  This restaurant could be a real gem with a pretty interesting menu, good food and a convenient location, but attention to making it right when they make it wrong should be a top priority."}
