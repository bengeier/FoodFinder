{"text":"I've had a lot of good jerk chicken and ox tail in my life.  But this place is down right disgusting.  These people are serving pieces of bone with no meat on it and jerk chicken that has more fat than any other chicken I've ever had and they're doing it with a straight face.  They should be absolutely ashamed for serving this mess.   Not to mention it tastes awful.  Salty and no proper spicing at all.  I can only imagine their patrons have no idea about good Jamaican food or they would never go there.  I paid 17 dollars with tax for a plate of rice and bones which they pass off as ox tail and jerk chicken with no flavour.  Their gravy is absolutely gross and salty without any proper spicing.  Save your money people avoid this place.   Absolutely disgusting and it's my fault for not going back to the counter and letting them know and getting my money back.  Instead just dumped it out and walked out."}
{"text":"Under-delivers.  I had high hopes walking in. The location and setting is fine for a find. I love the industrial with retail counter look. Plus this place is a lot bigger inside than I expected. Fuller menu than typical industrial counter. Plenty of burly factory or car shop workers getting their lunch. The staff serving up heaping big plates of rice and peas with delicious looking stuff on top. It all looked good. The signs were good upon walking in.  Unfortunately the meal I had did not deliver.   My jerk pork sandwich looked good. But he asked/assumed I wanted gravy on the meat so I said yes. Too bad. Turns out its beef gravy. So the taste of stock beef gravy on the pork was a bit of a mess. The meat itself looked good but was tasteless and or saltless. No spice or pepper. Boring and bland. Even the spicy beef patty i bought with it was weak.  So unfortunately this place will not be on my rotation. For a smaller place, but similar industrial counter feel, try the Patty King outlet on Progress. Better jerk pork sandwich. Or try small local joint Nun Such Jerk on Kennedy north of Lawrence.  Go get 'em."}
{"text":"Great jerk. I always get the jerk chicken dinner, $10 total with drink and tax. So damn good.  Also has breakfast and burger-type options as well. Seating area isn't great but it does the job.  Connected to a beef patty bakery / grocery, containing all traditional Caribbean items.  CASH ONLY unless you're spending over $10."}
{"text":"Great food, the place is a bit of a dive, but as long as you're getting takeout or don't care about ambiance, you'll be satisfied. The jerk pork is great, that's what I usually will get. The curry mutton is good too. Never tried their burgers, sandwiches, etc. Probably better to just stick with the jerk/curry items. They also sell bread (love the hardo bread) and patties (better than Patty King). The parking can be tricky because there isn't much of it and if you go around lunch time it can get full. Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Simple: the best jerk chicken I have had... the lunch meal with chicken and rice is simply incredible :) ... Also try the coco bread.. you can buy it in packs for home.. or in individual portions.   Parking... a bit tricky b/c it's a busy location, but well worth the food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Caribbean food, owned and operated by a Chinese family from Jamaica. They have take-out and cafeteria style meals. Plus they have a bakery for patties, sausage rolls, pastries and bread. Jerk chicken and pork is good. Not a huge fan of their oxtail or curry chicken. My favourite is curry mutton on rice and peas. Portion size is very generous. Crazy busy from 11:30am to 1:30pm. Go early because they can run out of stuff by 3ish."}
{"text":"The patties (the main reason why I came) are \"okay\" or even \"good\", but not great. They certainly satisfy the patty craving but otherwise they're not the best patties I've ever had in the GTA. They also serve hot plates, which was pretty good. I had their jerk chicken meal for lunch and it hit the spot. Again, not great, but good.   There's a lot of dining space if you plan to stay there for lunch, but there isn't a whole lot of parking spots available. Maybe a dozen at most, of which I suspect some are occupied by the staff. Speaking of the staff, they aren't rude, but they're not super friendly either. They just kind of go about the motions, almost cafeteria-like. Yes, that's the word, cafeteria. This place reminds me of a cafeteria. I may return the next time I have a patty craving, but for Caribbean style food there is a better option in the nearby area."}
{"text":"Huge portions of so-so jerk Decent beef patty (Extra spicy isn't very spicy) Rice n' Peas OR slaw with the \"dinner\" (not both which is the norm) Insane parking and lineups during the lunch hour Slow service at the 2nd cash (which is the only one that accepts debit)  Make a point of going at 11:45 and you'll beat the lines but you'll have a hard time exiting with the hordes of people coming in."}
{"text":"Decent jerk chicken & pork.   The chicken was definetly moist but the skin tasted bland and soft no crisp at all.  The pork on the other hand...i personally think that it tastes better. Has more flavor and probably cause it was so fatty!  The rice and beans was too soft for my likings.. I can tell that this place is definetly a hit because it took me 30mins to find a spot.. And not to mention people just kept going in the restaurant/bakery anyway..  IMO the food is decent..  But i definetly recommend you to try this place first!"}
{"text":"If I have forgotten my lunch (or been too lazy to make one) and need to quickly jump out and get something - I go here.  Prices are cheap and the jerk pork is great.  That could really be their slogan.  This place is always busy and the parking lot can be a bit of a dodge game, but it is worth it.  I recommend the patties, jerk pork and rice and peas. They have burgers, etc on the menu, but I haven't tried those (yet).  Avoid the gravy - it is a bit too salty.  If you want some sauce on your rice (hello - who doesn't?!) ask for the curry sauce.  They also have a little grocery store and in house bakery (haven't tried those yet either)."}
{"text":"My go to place for hearty jerk pork on rice and beef patties! At least once a week visit here when my work was just down the street. Portions are big and they never skimp on the gravy. Dine-in portion is definitely better than take out as they're limited to size of the container (although they pack in as much as they can). Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Their goat curry is FIRE!!!!!  I really like it!"}
{"text":"If your craving Jerk Pork, this is the place to go!  I wouldn't make a special trip out of, but if your in the area, you may want to come here for a quick bite.  They also sell frozen patties/meals so if you want to bulk stock on patties, they are well priced here.  This place is a bakery that makes fresh Hardo Bread and Patties daily.    Not your typical place to take a date but you will leave here full!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Tastee's delicious Jamaican beef patties throughout my whole life. It was really my first exposure to authentic Jamaican cuisine. I have always drove by this place thinking it was only the factory that produces the patties. So, when I actually walked by, I decided to finally check it out for lunch. I was amazed of how reasonably priced and how delicious the food is at this place. The jerk pork that everyone has been clamoring about has not disappointed. The meat is tender and juicy is very well complimented with the gravy.  So, if you were looking for a quick lunch or snack , then swing by Tastee's, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"$1.50 per patty, $7.25 half a dozen, $12.25 for a dozen beef patties.  Tastee's pretty much sells the standard beef patty, which in my experience had a more thin and crispy crust. I wish it had more beef filling, seemed a little on the light side.  There is a \"cash and carry\" section of the restaurant / bakery and a cafeteria style section where you can order jerk chicken as well."}
{"text":"Not sure what these Yelpers are excited about. The food was mediocre at best.  I had the Grilled Chicken sandwich. The chicken was pre cooked and only grilled to achieve the grill marks. I watched the cook grilled the buns, but some how it was still cold. The prices were fair... I guess everyone love the sausage rolls."}
{"text":"i have had better Jerk Chicken and Pork around the area but their food is not bad at all.  the Patties are really good though i would recommend them."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a quick meal. The patties are the best. Perfectly cooked. Service is always great. And then again, it's a patty for under $2. If you are expecting? a lot, then you should go to an actual dine-in restaurant and pay more (probably for the same food). I come here at least once a week to grab a box of patties for the folks in the office. Never a complain from anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome place for jerk pork\chicken. Servings are very generous and tasty. Jerk pork was a bit bland but some hot sauce does the job! Will be my new regular spot!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience here.  Lady at the cash was rude when I asked if she could combine my two stamp cards.  Also she was sneezing all over the place while packaging frozen patties, so they may have been contaminated.    Would recommend Richmond Hill location for better service.  Or for better, lighter and fluffier patties go to Michidean nearby."}
{"text":"The beef patties have a poor ratio of filling to crust. In addition, the crust is dry and isn't as flaky as I was expecting. The filling is well seasoned but I wish they had been more generous with it! I've also tried the jerk pork combo. I chose veggies to go with it and that was a very bad choice. The salad was literally frozen as there were ice particles still left on the leaves!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a few goodies from here.  Got one extra spicy beef patty $1.35 each - I have never had a beef patty which I thought was spicy. This one was a tiny bit spicy only even though they call it extra spicy. The outer shell was not really flaky and the inside was not really juicy. A decent patty. I still got a dozen frozen patty's which I think was $7.99.  Also got an oxtail rice and peas meal for about $10. Price is on the lower end when comparing with other places. The oxtail was not spicy and was not really fall off the bone tender. There was a lot of extra fat left on the oxtail too which made it more difficult to eat. Not that impressed with the oxtail meal.  Finally I also grabbed some kind of coconut pastry dessert. Tasted pretty good. Its the same kind of sweet coconut shavings that you find in those Chinese coconut buns. Overall, its a decent Caribbean food joint."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular that I would go out of my way to have again, but it is a heartwarming and pleasant meal. I ordered the Jerk Pork Dinner. For $10, you get a sizeable portion of pork on your choice or plain rice or rice and peas and gravy to your desired taste. No coleslaw or other accompaniment. I will note that the dine in portion seemed larger compared to my take-out order. Gravy was very beefy in flavour, and pork was a bit gamey for me, I wish I had ordered the chicken to try instead.!"}
{"text":"Man I've been on serious Caribbean food crawl recently as half my recent reviews have been from Caribbean joints!  Why? Cause it tastes so good that's why!  And how can one not talk about Caribbean food in Markham without talking about George's Tastee?  This place is a local landmark that has been here forever and still going strong.  Not only is this the central hub where their famous Tastee's Patties are made but they also serve solid Jamaican fare such as jerk and pork chicken, curry chicken and mutton and of course oxtail!    The patties come in a variety of styles and heat tolerance such as beef, chicken and vegetables.  I still prefer the likes of Patty Time and Randy's but they are still solid fare.  They also have a large variety of baked goods such such as hardo bread and there is even a cash and carry area where you can buy patties in bulk.  Over the years they have opened up satellite stores but this is where the original has been all these years as many of the people who come here for lunch are locals who work in the area.  Solid 4/5 for some classic Jamaican food!"}
{"text":"3.3 stars rounding down to 3..  Was in the area and wanted something quick.. Thought of getting a beef patty while running errands in the area.. Who doesn't elbow tasty patties?!?  Plenty of parking in a industrial area setting.. Walked into a cafeteria setting restaurant and saw the curry chicken dinner listed as the combo of the day $8.50.. Including a can of Diet Coke. Total came up to $10.75..  The rice and peas looked pretty bland and unimpressive when plated.. But surprisingly it had a really good kick in the flavour.. 4 stars..   Dinner came with 1 chicken leg chopped in 4 pieces.. The chicken was ok.. Was tender..the curry flavour would be 2.9 stars..  Nothing special.. But when you walk in, the aura of the restaurant looks like the food would be 4 stars experience with food court service..  Also had a beef patty for take-out which I ate driving off.. tasted just like the frozen ones you but under the same brand name.. I would expect it to taste better.. Given this was like their \"factory\"  Would come back to check out their ox-tail dinner.."}
{"text":"These guys have been around for so many years! Their patties are amazing... but their Jerk Pork dinners are an explosion of flavours! They are paired with their rice and beans a classic staple! The parking lot is always full and the staff is always friendly.  Note... if you're on your phone while in line you won't be served! So stay off it to keep the line moving. Alot of hungry customers are waiting don't hold up the line"}
{"text":"Went to Tastee's for lunch with a pal. First of all, I had no idea how big it was in there. Lots of tables for patrons. I just assumed it was just a huge@$$ bakery factory with no seats.   The jerk pork is quite delicious. If you order the medium it'd come w/ pilaf rice (actually i'm not sure what type of rice it was but it reminds me of pilaf lmao). It was about $5.99 or 6.99. My friend had to pack it for lunch the next day. I ordered a burger (approx $3.50) and it wasn't bad ! Almost like Harveys aka I know i'm probably not eating an odd part of a cow (at least i hope!)....it was good :) Next time I'll try the jerk chicken ! I found the jerk pork had a bit of fat on it...no biggie just cut it out.  Service was alright & they were all very polite. I would def. come back for lunch again as it's semi close to my office.  Parking - lots of space in the lot but I would suggest backing in so it won't be as difficult for you to leave afterwards.  They take debit but only if you order over $10."}
{"text":"I am a frequent patron of Ritz's jerk chicken and to me, this is pale in comparison.  The chicken was tender however the flavour (or lack of) was just ok. The portion of rice and chicken was good.  Overall, decent jerk chicken with decent gravy but at $8.95, it would have been better if it came with a side of coleslaw or salad."}
{"text":"If you like Jamaican or specifically meat patty or jerk chicken, this is the place for you. It is set up as fast food type place and the food itself is fairly inexpensive. The portions are generous and you can also treat it a bit like a grocery store as they have frozen items and bread for sale as well.   Overall a great place to go for lunch or dinner for some authentic Jamaican cuisine"}
{"text":"I was driving by through this industrial area and noticed this place was busy, so it got my attention I should stop here for lunch. Was at the tail end of the rush so no lines but the tables were mostly occupied.   There are 2 different line ups and cashiers- one was the hot food for sandwiches and jerk food and the other is for the patties and bread/bakery. So I went to both to satisfy my stomach's curiosity. Got 6 pack of patties beef & veg with normal spice, and the special jerk chicken with extra sauce (as other Yelpers suggested).   Please note: The dinner comes with either choice of slaw OR rice, REALLY?? This is where stars were lost, as the combo of slaw to cut the curry sauce is key with the essential rice & peas, you cannot pick just one but both need to be part of the meal. I did takeout and he did a great job filling the box until it managed to just close. Another star lost was for the filling of the patty. There's enough so when you bite, you don't lose any filling but lacking that your mouth is questioning this surprise. Normal was not spicy enough for me, I thought I was average spice level but I guess I should have asked for the next level up. The jerk was also a mild spice, but this extreme winter chill may be to blame for my taste buds.   I was however very pleased with the service, not sure if they were the owners(3 ppl served me) but they were very friendly and polite and because of this I wouldn't hesitate to come back. There's also a loyalty stamp card, but 10 dinners get one free."}
{"text":"Okay anyone who keeps going here doesn't know caribbean food. First of all their patties lack filling and the pastry itself is hard and dry. It's supposed to be buttery, crisp and flakey. If you want good patties go to Allans pastry shop off of kennedy or Randys off eglinton.   I've tried their jerk chicken and jerk pork, the chicken is a bit dry and lacks overall flavour, even the gravy just tastes like hot liquid. Their jerk pork was okay, portions are generous but again lacked in flavour. Also a FYI this is also at other locations.  If you want authentic caribbean food close to the tastee on Denison, just go down the street to Cravin's Caribbean Grill. Their jerk chicken is top 3 in the city for me (and i've had it everywhere), I'm pretty sure the same cooks or people who run it are also from Mona's Roti.   Anyways if you're still reading this, seriously there is no credit due at tastees cause its tasteless and NO I don't work or promote for other restaurants listed in this review, BUMBAAAAA."}
{"text":"Best jerk in the area. Pork w/ Oxtail gravy is incredible. Patties are also a family fave!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible. Ordered 2 beef spicy patties and the patties were dry. Their other locations ( Donmills and also Mccowan) makes much better patties.  Also, the old lady working there at the cashier was rude. If your unhappy with your job then you should quit.   Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Oxtail dinner is great! No msg and is full of flavour. Buns are traditional so is always good.   Family run business, owners are really friendly and the place gets rather busy around lunch and dinner times."}
{"text":"The husband and I are always in search for a good Jamaican restaurant and I think we found our go to spot in Toronto.  Daily specials are flashed on a monitor next to the main menu.  On this being our first visit, we decided to go with the oxtail, jerk chicken and beef patties.  All of which became favorites.   Overall no complaints from me.  We'll definitely head back here the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This is the main factory and cafeteria for George's operation.  They've been around forever.  I already reviewed their newest place already and my view is the same. This is a great place to get patties, Caribbean foods, sandwiches and burgers.  It's a local hot spot for all the industrial and office buildings nearby. I usually buy a six pack of extra spicy and walk it into my client's office.  I use it as a bribery tool.  You won't believe what you can get for some of these golden pockets of goodness."}
{"text":"By far the best oxtail dinner ever! At one point I was coming in here at least 2 or 3 times a week for the oxtail...yes, its that good!   All their dinners (jerk chicken,  jerk pork) are a great deal. Huge portions of juicy, tender, flavorful chicken or pork and rice & peas.   The jerk pork sandwich and subs are great too when I'm not in the mood for food overload!    I work in the area but have even brought my family down here for a Saturday lunch to let them enjoy!"}
