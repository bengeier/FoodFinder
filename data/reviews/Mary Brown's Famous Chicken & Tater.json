{"text":"Chicken is fresh oil tasting.   The wedges had an odour and tasted off. Obviously another restaurant who doesn't clean their fryers thorough and regularly. Too bad. Such a waste to cook MBs classic and award worthy wedges in crappy oil. It used to be better with previous owners. The only good MBs is Whitby north and Bowmanville. The regional managers should crack down on quality and regular processes."}
{"text":"chicken tasted like it was cooked under a heatlamp. fries soggy,like wet paper. went and got refund that evening. staff accomodated refund and could not understand why food was so poor as the time of purchase was when owners were working. this is the furst time ive ever asked for a refund for fast food."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummy!  Best fried chicken with Popeyes really close behind  I prefer the sides at Popeyes though  Now only if Mary Browns had fountain soda instead of the canned pops, just a personal preference :P"}
{"text":"Yuck.  This was my first time at any Mary Brown's chicken so I don't know how it compares to other locations. But wow was this food gross. They have one sandwhich consisting of plain white bread, chicken and topped and swimming in gravy. Yuck. But my friend wanted it so he ordered it and wow was it bad. The gravy was so bland.  I had chicken fingers. I was surprised at how bad they are. How can you mess up chicken fingers? They weren't crispy at all. The breading was really weird - hard to describe.   I really want to give this place 1 star, but I feel like this is more a matter of taste than my other reviews. Maybe someone out there does like Mary Brown's Chicken...   Oh, and the bathrooms were really gross. Obviously they aren't cleaned regularly or let to air out."}
{"text":"I am writing this review mostly because I don't think the others are fair to this restaurant.  I have been a patron since it opened and visit usually once per month.  I have experienced nothing but friendly, accurate and speedy service.  Therefore, I was surprised to read that others apparently haven't had the same treatment.    Mary Brown's fried chicken is not as crispy as KFC or Popeyes.  However, the meat itself and not just the coating is, overall, tastier than the aforementioned chains.  Mary Brown's has arguably the tastiest chicken breat pieces for those who are fans of white meat.  Because their marinade is likely some sort of brine, in my experience, their white meat pieces have never, ever been dry.  What is also notable about the way they prepare their chicken (unlike all other chicken chains I can think of) is that all pieces are trimmed of excess fat and skin prior to preparation.  For those wishing to try their signature dishes without spending a lot, they have daily lunch specials under six bucks.  Everyone has different prefernces.  However, taking process and care into consideration, a fried chicken \"foodie\" would probably understand why Mary Brown's has a loyal following."}
{"text":"Visited for first time ever this past weekend.  Came away impressed with the quality and quantity of food that they offered.  Pieces were big and juicy. The box of potato wedges was practically overflowing .  Very decent deal.  Too bad it is far from downtown core or I'd definitely visit more often."}
{"text":"I drop in for their chicken whenever I'm in their neighborhood which isn't too often unfortunately.  Much better chicken than KFC and Popeyes put together.  Wish Mary would come to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"So much for my low-carb diet.  I think I'll stick with smaller portions on a regular basis, with some exercise thrown in for good measure!!  To celebrate my return to regular eating, I decided to go for some fast food!!  For some reason, I had a craving for some chicken...  This was the first time eating chicken from this franchise.  Like many people, our default fast-food chicken place would be KFC.  The more adventurous folk go for Popeye's (my personal fave).    This location is situated in a little plaza which has a few fast-food choices.  The strip mall also has a Starbucks, a shwarma place and Quesada Mexican grill.  There's even a gas bar if you want something from the convenient store!    Anyway, I had the 2-pc. chicken meal for $7.99, which normally consisted of coleslaw, a can of pop, and their famous taters.  Apparently there are both small and large sized chicken pieces, and the combo usually gets 2 LG pieces.  They only had small, so they gave me 3 smalls instead of 2 large.  I also ordered a small gravy, which was  $1.50 or something, extra.  The cashier, a nice elderly lady, must have read my mind, because she said they would substitute the gravy for the slaw!!  SWEET!  So, to summarize, I left the place with a bulging box of fried chicken on a bed of breaded potato wedges with gravy and pop on the side!!    The food:  definitely not as greasy as KFC and more lightly seasoned than the KFC Original recipe.  There is definitely less of a kick to this chicken than those from Popeye's, but that's not a dig on the taste.  The chicken tasted good, without weighing me down with too much breading.  The taters were VERY GOOD.  I don't recall another fast food joint that makes them like this.   All in all, a satisfyingly good lunch devoid of any vegetables whatsoever!!!  BONUS!  :D"}
{"text":"Let me say that I enjoyed their chicken and poutine.   The place is more of a sit in and have your food, I ordered Spicy burger with Taters Poutine. The chicken had a nice taste to it and was not watery like KFC but neither was it crunchy like Popeyes. The Burger was quite good and the seller here were the Taters... They were little spicy and cheese and sauce made it amazing.  The service was quick. Overall decent meal!  For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times over the last year and a half. Very happy with the food and service.  The server always has a smile and is very friendly and helpful regarding the menu. The service is quick and the food has always tasted fresh.   It is a tiny store located next to a gas station however it is very clean and there are a few seats as well. Love the mini Mary burger and I'm excited for the Big MARY monday deal coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is a lot better than I expected, especially because its Hallal. Service was terrible, my order was taken wrong and so were many other customers'."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time, food is awesome, service is great but after the renovation I found out they are NO LONGER HALAL, which sucks. I get my Mary Browns cravings satisfied in Brampton now."}
{"text":"It's my first time to have this and their chicken sandwich and taters were so good! The taters were irresistible and I just had to finish every bit of the small size. The chicken sandwich was awesome too at 3.99 as they had this promo called Mary's Monday. I ordered them to go because I had to drive and I couldn't resist eating them while waiting for red lights to turn green. It was  one of those rare drives when I wished there were more red lights"}
{"text":"Since there were 2 of us, I'm going to split the difference between our ratings. John's order was bang on... exactly what he wanted in taste, quality and quantity. I on the other hand, asked for a 3 piece chicken all white meat and received a rib, wing and a drumstick. The lady behind the counter saw the issue but the cook didn't seem to see the problem. Eventually I got a breast. The chicken was well cooked but bland and the gravy not to my taste at all. I just don't think I'm a Mary Brown's kind of guy."}
{"text":"I first discovered Mary Brown's almost 20 years ago on Queen Street in Streetsville (Mississauga) when I used to work up that way.  It was in a strip mall and a small place.  It wasn't fancy or well known at least to me at the time but it stuck with me for all those years.  Fast forward to this last summer when a group of friends had a picnic in High Park and one of our group brought Mary Brown's as his contribution and I was like... damn son that's something that brings back memories.  Now I've always known Mary Brown's was around but it wasn't something I would thought of and wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to get because well it was one of those out of sight out of mind situations.    KFC which I've sort of gladly fallen out of love with quite a few years back has partly to do with my wife in the fact that she hates them.  She had a bad experience decades ago and hasn't eaten at KFC since.  Still, I've had my fair share of going to KFC a year here or there but very occasionally.  Together we are more partial to Popeye's as far as take out fried chicken is concerned.  They are more available sure and they're better IMO than KFC by a long shot although I still don't get it why there's no Cajun Sparkle to be had in Canada.  Not only until I somehow noticed that there was a Mary Brown's not far from my home was my love for them rekindled.  I mean I love fried chicken.  I can't say it's my absolute favorite meal since I have so many that I like but it's right up there for me.  The store I'm referring to is at the north east corner of Eglinton and Dixie connected to a gas station.  While this area is literally saturated with places to eat, this one is well tucked away although it faces the street, it's very inconspicuous being such a small foot print in this very busy area right across the street from one of if not the busiest post offices in the country (Gateway).  On my way home one evening I decided to grab us some dinner and because I haven't been in forever I had no idea how the menu was going to be as far as sizes, prices etc.  I needed a few minutes to go over the options but I wasn't pressured since the place wasn't that busy.  I had tried to go to this place several times before but they seem to close at 7pm most evenings and on the May long weekend even though I went before 7pm there was a sign on the door saying they'd be closed Sunday and Monday (insert sad face emoji).  I was happy that I'd finally get to order, it was a good feeling like then you go to the mall and you don't have to drive around for 10 minutes looking for a parking spot or like getting on the subway and finding a seat or getting green lights all the way home.  It felt like it was my lucky day...  I went with the 8 piece meal which included 1 medium side salad and choice of fries or taters etc.  I went with the taters (yum) and a macaroni salad and gravy.  I had asked about the breakdown of the pieces because some places if you don't ask I've found in my life will try to give you an imbalanced meal of only dark meat.  My wife doesn't like dark meat which is fine because I'll eat any pieces but true enough, breasts are bigger than thighs and drumsticks so it's also about value.  That and she only really prefers the wings.  She's got perma dibs on those pieces.  It was explained that the 8 pieces would be 2 thighs, 2 drums, 2 wings, 2 breast pieces.  That's perfect, basically an entire chicken EVEN.  The meal came out to about 27 bucks with tax.  I'm only about a 10 minute drive home and when I got home the plates came out right away.  The chicken is nicely cooked, juicy, and fresh.  The pieces were decently sized, not necessarily huge but not tiny either.  The taters are amazing.  I love these potatos... they're sort of coated so they're thick but also not bland.  Their gravy is brown, sort of like what could be considered \"beef\" gravy as opposed to white \"chicken\" gravy.  Either way their gravy is awesome with their potatoes and chicken.  I found this is good value considering Popeye's for about the same meal is about 10 bucks more.  Mary Brown's may not be Halal (I'm not sure) but for us it doesn't matter.  I'd say it's way better than KFC by far and sort of reminds me of Bojangles which we don't have here in Canada.  Either way I really ike Mary Brown's and I'm happy they are close to where I live so I can go back more often.  The value is good, the quality is good and the chicken is great!"}
{"text":"The first few times I came in here when it first opened, I would have given in 4 stars, but today I was really disappointed.   The chicken itself was still good. Lightly battered and crunch, not as oily as its competitions. It's got a spicy taste, but is mild.  I haven't bought fried chicken in a year and forgot the protocol of indicating white or dark meat, I hate white meat. She also didn't prompt me either.   The taters.... I remember the first time I came in here, I was drooling at first bite of the taters. and I got SO much that I saved it to go home and heat up.   Today, I got maybe a quarter of the box of taters, and they were soggy and not the same.   My next craving of fried chicken, I'll got to popeyes across the street..."}
{"text":"I walked into a Smoothy/Espresso Bar, apparently this Mary Brown's shares real estate with Juicy King.  I was welcomed by a friendly cashier and ordered 2 Piece Combo($7.89 per 2 Piece Chicken, Choice of Salad, Choice of Tater or Fries, CAN of Pop).  It doesn't have as much playful/colorful theme decor as Popeyes but still has enough to know that this is a Fried Chicken place.  The Chicken came out fresh and I notice quite a big piece of Rib portion but then quickly realized that it's not only the Rib but the Breast as well.  That is almost a NEW concept for Fast Food Fried Chicken because KFC does a 9 Piece method(2 Leg, 2 Thigh, 2 Rib, 2, Wing, 1 Breast) but if I saw what I saw then MB's does the 8 Piece method(2 Leg, 2 Thigh, 2 Rib/Breast, 2 Wings).  This means a higher percentage of getting a delicious portion of Chicken Breast.  The Chicken itself was OK but not spectacular or memorable as it seems that the herbs & spice mix doesn't seem INTENSE enough.  The crispiness isn't as great as the other places either.  It's not addictive enough and it doesn't come SPICY, so for now I will stick to PE's outside of the Downtown core.  The Taters lacked seasoning as well, and I realized another lady went up to ask for SALT because the meal came with 2 packs of Ketchup but no Salt/Pepper/Wetnap package that KFC provides.  You can notice as well they don't provide FOUNTAIN Drinks but rather can Pop.  I noticed a sign behind the front door that showed TODAY'S SPECIAL, 2 Piece, Taters, Pop for $5.99 but I'm not sure if it's just Today Tuesday.    I noticed underneath the Coleslaw there was 2 DOTS.  FYI, for KFC they are suppose to put a Date Stamp on the bottom of the package however just for your knowledge, Date Stamps CAN be replaced by another newer one.  I haven't decoded Mary Brown's 2 Dot language yet.  Anyone know???"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch today while doing work visits.  Had the Big Mary Combo with taters and coleslaw. Not sure why the breaded chicken sandwich has 'big' in its name as it is averae sized. The taters are pretty salty; the coleslaw is salty as well. Overall, I found the food to be 'meh' - nothing to write home about.  Aesthetically, this place looks very tired and needs a make-over. The prices could be a little cheaper with better lunch deals.  I've experienced better, meh."}
{"text":"Being from the east I thought I would treat myself to a taste of home. I should have saved the money. The guy talked me into the Big Mary Sandwich as it was on sale. I do love a sandwich. Unfortunately an entire half of the chicken was gristle/connective tissue/inedible. I got taters on the side and asked for dressing and gravy (it's a Newfie thing) as it's on the in-store menu. The guy told me they don't do it there. False advertisement. The taters weren't salted. Potatoes need a lot of salt. Not a good deal. I don't see a lot of reason to  go back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly,  this was my first visit to a Toronto location.   First time ever being in Guelph.    I always order the mini Mary combo with poutine with their famous taters.    Usual taste,  but I was surprised they didn't get my order right the first time as it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 pieces of dark chicken. We were told we would have to wait 20 minutes because it was being freshly made. That was definitely not a problem because we had the time and I wanted fresh chicken. Sadly when we ate the chicken it tasted bad, like months  old chicken that was in the freezer. Even with all the deep frying you can't mask how old the chicken was. We tried more of it and ended up throwing all of it out. It was disgusting. I love MB, but NEVER COME TO THIE LOCATION!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good before the Reno, now it's no longer halal which sucks as it's the only location in Toronto. I rarely eat at Mary Browns because the nearest halal location is all the way in Brampton."}
{"text":"Figured I would update my last review. That disgusting burger I ate was actually a new menu item added by head office. It was so bad, I thought this was a rogue franchise adding weird stuff to their menu.  The owner of this location is actually a very nice guy. (pretty sure the guy who is there 90% of the time I drop by is the owner).   This location is near my office so I drop by every monday (Big Mary Mondays FTW). Love the food. Great customer service. 4 stars because of the nasty \"hot chicken sindwich\" on their menu. The big mary burger is great though."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite before heading somewhere else on a Friday afternoon. The place was empty, and the staff were vacuuming and didn't really acknowledge the customers. I got a few things off the value menu: chicken snack pop-in ($2.99) and the single chicken wing ($1.99). Portions were small for what I paid for, and I already didn't pay very much. Food was sorta bland, and wasn't very crispy. Popeyes has better crunch and more seasoning for the same price. The honey mustard was a neon yellow colour, but the taste was fine. That being said, I think the Popeyes one plaza over has this place beat with bigger and a wider variety of sauces and generally better chicken."}
{"text":"Lady behind the counter ywas very nice.  But we came in right at opening and found the tables hadn't been cleaned from the night before.... thats gross"}
{"text":"I love MB.. their taters are the best.  Cicken is a hit or miss.  Sometimes it tastes like it has been sitting for quite sometime as its dry.  Other times... MB standards.  So who knows.  Service is friendly enough... can be slow waiting for a 2pcs.  I do not like their salads and always substitute for a gravy."}
{"text":"I am giving a rating of 3.5 stars and am rounding up.  Every week, my department goes out for lunch. I made the suggestion to go to Mary Brown's. I have never been to one before. The closest one to my home is in Pickering. Since this one in Mississauga is a five-minute drive away from work, it made more sense to drop by and give it a try.  It took me a number of iterations to figure out what I wanted. I cycled from a two-piece chicken combo, to the Big Mary (not me) sandwich, to the three-piece chicken combo.  When I first walked in, I noticed the small counter. There were seats, but they are limited. Luckily, we were there at noon. We had first dibs.  I also noticed that one of the middle menu screens was out. It was the menu that would have displayed the chicken tenders that I was about to order. I'm glad that I looked at the online menu before coming in.  Of course, there was a sign that said that there was a hot chicken sandwich combo (it comes with a drink) for $5.99. I love a good hot chicken sandwich, but I already had my mind set on getting the chicken fingers combo.  I placed my order. I could have swapped the taters that come with the combo for a mac and cheese salad. Instead, I wanted to experience everything. So, I got a small mac and cheese salad on the side.  The woman was friendly and asked for my name, so that she could let me know that my order was ready.  The downside going to such an establishment is that whenever someone says Mary, I turn. Ugh!  My order was finally ready. I went to fetch my order and return to the table.  The table is small for four people. We ended up giving back our trays so that we had more space to eat.  My chicken tenders were long in length. This place puts all your food into cute little boxes. As a result, some of my chicken tenders were bent and broken. It wasn't a major catastrophe, but I would be okay if they were jutting out of the box instead of stuffing them into the box.  The tenders were juicy and yummy. They weren't salted to death, which I appreciated. The downside was that I only got one little sweet and sour dipping sauce. I needed two.  The taters were okay. Frankly, I could have done without them. There were way too many that I ended up in a mild carb coma an hour after finishing my meal.  I loved the mac and cheese salad. Next time, I will substitute the taters for this salad. I need to give the coleslaw a try, as my colleague loves it.  My combo came with a canned drink. I went with a Diet Pepsi.  If you are lactose-intolerant, the chicken is dipped in buttermilk, so you may feel some of the effects. I managed to take my lactase pills before I ate, so I was okay.  This place is clean and bright, other than the dim middle menu screen.  I'd come back here to give the regular chicken combos a try. There are a number of specials, depending on when and what day you visit.  (67)"}
{"text":"This place used to be better.  I went there the other day and got 4 pieces and wedgies. The wedgies were perfect, and what you expect from Mary Brown's: fresh, flavourful, and perfect with their suspect gravy.   Unfortunately every piece of chicken i had was dry, and lacked flavour. This had never happened under the old ownership."}
{"text":"Mary Browns is one of my favourite fast food fried chicken spots.  Some locations are not good but this one is really good. Staff are really friendly and the food is cooked well.  I come here a lot, but there is good reason."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years.  To me this place blows chain chicken places out of the water.  The chicken is crispy outside and juicy inside.  I often have the big Mary sandwich... It's my favorite!  Taters and gravy is quite tasty too!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"One day I was going to work but then I decided I was going to Mary Brown's to eat chicken all day instead.  Crispy fried chicken, taters were phenomenal, coleslaw was moist and cool. Staff were patient and courteous as well despite my multiple large orders. No complaints here. I'm closer to Yorkdale but I'll take the extra time to travel down Dufferin."}
