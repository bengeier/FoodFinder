{"text":"Lousy food,caused food poisoning. .Very poorly managed and understaffed restaurant.The owner takes the cake as he was around but never greeted or interacted with the guests who were present there.I don't think this place will remain in business for long as overall experience was 2 out of 10. Owner thinks he is Rajnikant, just walks around with his phone on his ear. Recommend all to stay away from this trashy place.   The server was very helpful and pleasing and that is the only reason they are not getting a zero rating from me. I saw a few 5 star rating on Yelp and Google and decided to dine there but I am sure those ratings are put up by the owner or his friends and family. I spoke to a couple of people seated around us in the restaurant and they were also complaining about the food and the service. Will report them to the health department and hopefully they will shut them down for good for serving spoiled/old food or unhygienic condition due to which me and my family got sick."}
{"text":"Lekochi is a rare gem for authentic Kerala cuisine in Brampton, everything we tried was really good,  Staff was friendly and the service was good,the prices are reasonable the interior decor could use a bit of tweaking but it's clean.  Definately will come back for their take on the 'railway biryani' ! And the Kerala style Tea was spot on!"}
{"text":"Went in skeptical about the authenticity but wow was really good. The malabar chicken and chicken roast was wonderful and the parota was light and fluffy. Definitely recommend this place to everyone. Would have given it a five star rating except that the girl waiting at our table seemed irritated and very preoccupied. They need to work with their staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tiny with a few dine in seats but the food is as authentic as it gets. My favourite dishes was the biryani, mango smoothie, chicken pops, fish baked in banana leaf, devilled beef. I loved that they used coconut and tamarind. I cannot wait to go back! nice and spicy just as I like it."}
{"text":"I like the food it's to good .. service is bit slow . I hope service will get better ."}
{"text":"I tried almost everything in the menu. I visit this place almost every week :). My favourite items are Railway Biryani, Chicken Chatti Curry, Parotta, Mutton Roast..list goes on..The food tastes absolutely authentic."}
{"text":"Went there after seeing some good yelp reviews. We tried fish pollichathu, beef fry, parota, appam, chicken ulli mulak and railway biriyani. The fish pollichathu is a must try and was the star of the evening. Railway biriyani was also nice. Its steamed inside a banana leaf so it had some special taste and brought back memories of how my grandmother use to pack meal in banana leaf when we used to travel in train. The chicken ulli mulak had a very pungent taste of raw ulli and was a disappointment. Beef was not that great. It tasted like reheated one. The appam shown in the catalog was nice palappams but the one we got was like tatu dosa's. Overall it was ok and will go back for the fish and biriyani."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. We had the iconic beef fry and mutton stew and neither disappointed.  Appams were tasty but disappointed that they make them like pancakes and not the classical way. Not much of an ambience so do focus on the food."}
{"text":"Let me be honest, this place has tasty food. This is what made me travel for more than an hour to this restaurant.  But beware when you take out food. For some reason, they happen to make a lot of \"accidents\" in the number of items ( just in placing them) while being super accurate in the bill.  The owner told me that it's always my responsibility to verify the quantity and number while doing take out from there ( which shows how unreliable they are).  Also their service is one of the worst. They mess up with the orders and delay food all the time.  Please be careful while doing take out and make sure you confirm it before you leave the place or be ready to face the worst customer service and worst attitude on the phone ( he blatantly said that his business is thriving and a few unhappy customers are not going to make any difference to him).  Hope that none of you reading this review have such a bad experience."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant as soon as I found out they had Kerala cuisine. Nice small restaurant with modern touches.  Dum biriyani was okay, nothing to write home about, fish curry was fantastic with the right about of sour and spice. Beef fry could use either a beer or more spice.  Service? Probably one of the worst we had, basic service like providing water when asked would be a start. Oh and waiting and hour for food is not normal, I think they had a rice field in the kitchen and were harvesting rice then and there.  We will return but will wait for the restaurant to figure out their teething problems.  Food - 3.5 stars ambiance 3.5 stars Service 1 star."}
{"text":"Great place, tried the malabar chicken, house fish and parantha. Can't wait to try other stuff"}
{"text":"Ordered veg stew and appam, was very disappointed. Worst appams and veg stew ever tasted, on top of this the staff is so rude,never coming back again."}
{"text":"Good humble Malayalam food place. The fish in banana leaf and chicken meen curry was pretty good. The malabar chicken biriyani was surely a disappointment. The coconut pudding is surely the eye candy of the place and taste good, it's a nice spin off to tapioca pudding (thai prep). Service however failed quite bad. If one has to call the server's to order dessert after a long wait then it's just bad. Moreover we had to wipe our table clean so that we can have a nice clean table for our dessert. They surely can UP their game by bringing some professionals and take feedback on how they should serve customers. Otherwise good place, surely will try again."}
{"text":"The food is gr8, the Urily fish curry is awesum."}
{"text":"-Lots of parking -Table seems taller then seats. But not a big issue. I am 5'7 -I found my food very good. The proportion was kind of small. I got the chicken 21 and a mango smoothie and the bill with tip cane out to 25 dollars. Maybe 6 small pieces of small chicken wedges.  -my friend ordered curry and it didn't come with rice so he did not have a good experience -the menu is not very detailed for customers who are new"}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is very poor. You wait forever and during that time pray that they get your order right and perhaps serve you some water.   They are understaffed for waiters especially for peak hours.   I was hoping to do a take out the next time but then I read a review on the take out service \"attitude\". No thank you!! I shall just stay away. There are other places one can find malayalee food right???    Customer service is everything! Hopefully they can improve on it."}
{"text":"One word: heaven.  The parota and beef curry was so authentic that for thirty glorious minutes, I was transported to the backwaters of Kerala.   The coconut sauce base used in most preparations is reminiscent of the cuisine I was used to when I lived in India.  Service is slow, and the place is a tad disorganized, but this adds to its authenticity. Drove from Waterloo to check this place out and it was definitely well worth it.  I'm going back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"The plates were dirty. It took 40 minutes for the appetizers to come. Authentic Kerala food. Take the chillies sign seriously because most of their food items are very spicy. I ordered Gobi Manchurian which was very salty. Chicken kozhi is very spicy. Malabar chicken biryani was alright. Their menu has very vague descriptions of the food items so one doesn't know what they are ordering. All the chicken dishes are with bones, which is not specified on their menu. The owner asked us for our feedback about the food. He was not very accepting of our feedback. The service is very slow. We were at this restaurant for exactly 2 hours."}
{"text":"Loved the food here. We tried chicken kothi chathachu from the starters and prawns masala from the main course to go along with kappa and kerala paratha. Was good enough for 2 and was billed about 37CAD. Perfect ambience and good food."}
{"text":"Food was no doubt good, but for that we tested our patience.  Couple of things can improve much better output.  More trained staff, needing of better waiters is a good thing, small area and more demand so dining in is not a great idea. Take out is much better option  Needs of each table was not met, realistic needs like water, food items spaced on orders like each person ordering different food one get one and others wait and others finishing.  But good effort of starting a authentic South Indian   Typical mallu style restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food....The railway biryani made me nostalgic!! If you are looking for authentic Malayalee food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"So I heard about this place for a few months now and wanted to check it out & just to my luck, around the holiday season (Dec. 24th and 25th to be precise), they had a special 12 course meal for only $15!!! We were a party of 5 and opted to attend their lunch seating on Christmas Eve. The appetizers consisted of a traditional South Indian mutton soup (loved it!!!), a fruit salad in a coconut, creamy, curd base with poppy seeds (meh) and grilled meats that included chicken skewers, fried King fish, jumbo shrimp etc (heaven!!!).The main courses took over an hour to arrive but were beautifully presented (you could tell that their chef really took the time to put his heart and soul into the presentation of the dishes) and included traditional dishes such as Red Fish curry, Beef Fry, Chicken Roast, Mutton Stew and Duck Curry. I wasn't too much of a fan of the mutton stew but the rest of it was deeeelish! I was super impressed that all of these items were served in authentic earthenware. For dessert, we were served a caramelized sweet vanilla ice cream, fruit cake and a grape juice mixed with Sprite which was uniquely served in a glass bottle with a bow!   Heads up if you're checking out this place for the first time - do so only if and when you have ample time to enjoy your meal and experience. Our 45 minute seating that was reserved landed up to be 3.5 hours because of extremely slow service and disorganized staff (on numerous occasions we had to signal the wait staff to bring cutlery or water or napkins). They also tend to forget the order of seating and randomly serve patrons rather than going according to when customers come in to the restaurant and are seated. My extra two cents here is to highlight that Patience is an ultimate virtue with this place. The food is definitely worth it!"}
