{"text":"Don't sleep on this hidden gem. The place is small but very clean and inviting. The waitress was very nice and pleasant. The food portions are great. We had the pad thai (definitely better than the upscale Basil Thai restaurant), chicken wings (very well seasoned), and ribeye steak salad (extremely flavorful). Everything we had was delicious! Taste just as good as the pad thai that you would be get in Thailand (trust me on that). Pricing is very reasonable for the quality and portion. Menu is limited but had the right options for a thai/vietnamese spot. This is our new favorite spot from now on."}
{"text":"Came here when they were about a month or so in and replaced Thai Viet, which I used to love.  We had a few appetizers, pho, pad see ew, fried rice and curry.  While the service was excellent and top-notch, the food wasn't all too great.  The pho was the only good item, while the other dishes lacked actual flavor.  I was very disappointed with the pad see ew, as all I tasted was saltiness.  There was barely any sauce so it was pretty dry.  The egg rolls and wings were very crispy, but just so bland.  We all left disappointed, but will probably try it out again in a few months (as it is still new) in hopes that there will be some changes to improve the food."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai Food! Great lunch specials. So glad I found this place after my office moved here from the Plaza Midwood area."}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time from this restaurant, a take our order of seafood fried rice. My past experience with Thai fried rice has always been great, so I gave them a try. I'm not impressed with the rice. The seafood is good but the rice itself is bland, not much spice or flavor. I'll try another dish but overall my first visit didn't wow me."}
{"text":"First time we came here with new owners. Looks nice and clean and was quite busy/ A good sign! The waitress was obviously overwhelmed as she seemed to be basically working alone and didn't seem to have much experience. Took a while to get our drink order and we had to ask to finally get our sweet tea. Finally got it and our order was taken. During our wait, a woman  \"customer\" came in and started helpig the waitress. This allowed her to get caught up and it went ok afterward. Turns out, it was her Mother! (Great MOM)
WE ordered Fresh Rolls (used to be summer rolls). They were ok, but not as good as before. Sandy got Pad See ew which was pretty good and I got the Lemon grass pork special. 
Overall, everything was good, not great. The foor portions seemed smalled than before, but the quality, freshness and taste were very good. 
I am being generous with the 4 stars, probably a 3 1/2 because of the service, but overall not bad. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is amazing and service is fast and friendly.  I have tried several items, but really always go back to their Pad Thai and Pho.  Their spring rolls are hot and delicious as well.  I really haven't had a bad meal there and would recommend it as the best in Union County.  There are other options, but none as authentic and tasty as Chokh Di."}
{"text":"We used to live in \"Chambodia\" in Atlanta and got very spoiled on good Asian cuisine such as Pho. After moving to Union County, we have been in a desert for good Asian food. Until tonight, that is. Go eat here. It's very good. The prices are reasonable. We tried a lot of different things: beef larb (which is basically meat you wrap in lettuce leaves), spring rolls (decent), tom kha soup (really good & heavenly creamy though I'm not used to tomatoes in the soup), beef pho (not the giant portion we used to see at pho shops in Atlanta but very good), chicken pad Thai (solid), and Massaman chicken curry (very good though I could have handled a wee bit more spice, but exactly right for average American palate). Our son turned his nose up at the chicken satay, but who ever said preschoolers have refinement? His loss, it was tasty! The Thai iced tea was a real treat, the regular iced tea had a nice bite to it, and the hot Jasmine tea was great on a cold rainy night. Yes, we pigged out and spent too much because we ordered half the menu, but dear Lord this was like coming home. There is no comfort food like Asian comfort food. The service was very good too. Coming back and bringing friends!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai Food the other night and decided to try this place out. Although it was a bit far and the traffic on independence didn't help my road rage, it was definitely worth it. We ordered the Beef Larb, Chicken Red Curry and Shrimp Pad Thai. Everything was wonderful- the food, the service, and the Taro Bubble Tea we ordered! We inhaled the Pad Thai and I was able to take the rest of the Curry and the Larb togo for leftovers (and FYI, the food was still delicious the next day) I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We love the Chokh Di Noodles and Penang curry. My only complaint is that it is often closed when we want to go."}
{"text":"This is the glass noodle dish. It had absolutely no flavor. When I asked to just take it off the bill as it had no flavor, she asked if I wanted more fish sauce. They were kind enough to take it off the bill. I do appreciate that they bring diversity, please keep working on your flavors."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The food is amazing and the service is great. The Pho Ga is flavorful and all the ingredients taste very fresh. The spring roll appetizer is also very hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Went there cause I wanted some pho. The waitress was nice. The place is cute and small. The pho was okay. I probably wouldn't pick that as my first pho place choice though. I'd rather go somewhere in charlotte."}
{"text":"Just call me Flavor Flav, I'm gonna be Chokh Di's hype man!  I did what I do best, order everything! Green curry chicken, sweet sriracha chicken wings, papaya salad, chicken larb, pad see ew and my friend ordered fried tofu and another vegetarian dish!  We pigged out!  Everything was delicious, the stand outs for me were the chicken wings and the chicken larb. It's the best chicken larb I've had in Charlotte, really fresh with herbs, red onion and perfect heat level.  Worth the trek down Independence!
Yo, Chuck, show 'em what you can do, boy"}
{"text":"Rude and incompetent service by the waiter ruined dinner. Food from the kitchen was extremely slow and came out in the wrong order but the only waiter in the restaurant compounded the poor experience. His arrogant attitude and total disregard for the customer has us scratching this below average spot from our list."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in NC! Definitely my new Thai place, food was great, fish tank is cool, def going back"}
{"text":"Wow they are just so consistently great all the time. And now they've added fried chicken to their menu. It was so good. I ordered it with fried rice instead of white.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Me and some friends went in here to grub. We had a groupon and wanted to try it. The staff were super chill and the food was fucking delicious. If you're looking for a flavor explosion in your face hole I definitely suggest eating here. I can recommend the tom sum soup, the pork pad see ew (lvl 1), and the fresh roles."}
{"text":"Had the Chokh Di lunch special #7 at a spice level of 3 and it was perfect. The only reason why the rating is a four is that they don't serve alcohol. I'm not sure the a/c was working properly either but the food, service and decor were great. Would definitely go back to try something different."}
{"text":"Not happy with flavors, helpings or price. Sorry they can't compare to their predecessor."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place!!!  I got the yummy Pho soup which was huge and full of flavor.  The mister got curry chicken, which he loved. As for the kids, they got something too (I can't remember what they got)  The service is over the top! Very courteous and willing to help us with choices. The prices are fair for what you get.  We left with enough for lunch tomorrow.  I've been wanting a good Pho soup for a long time and I finally found a place. 
I will be coming back for sure.  Support local business and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Glad to be the first to write a review because I have to tell you this place is really really really really good.   I had the beef pad se ew and chicken wings.  The chicken wings are fried perfectly and crispy.  And the pad se ew is not dry like some other Thai place.  A medium size restaurant but big enough to hold large parties.  It's located down independence Blvd.  They switch owners from
Viet/Thai restaurant.  This place is a must try in our city.  I suggest going in groups to try everything or just stop by for lunch.   I promise you'll thank me. This was my third time coming here and I live down by steele creek. It's worth the drive.  Also try their pho, it's a hidden gem on the menu."}
{"text":"In general, the food was OK, but nothing spectacular.  I started with the spring rolls.  Normally, I love spring rolls, but these were just kind of flavorless and the dipping sauce that came with them had an odd taste that I've never encountered before in any Vietnamese restaurant.  Usually, you'll get a sweet chili sauce or fish sauce with spring rolls - this wasn't either.  It was like vinegary duck sauce. Meh.  I wouldn't try them again.  

The pho was pretty good, but the serving a little smaller than what I'm used to, so I followed that up with something else.  I tried the beef Krateam Prik Tai.  The beef was flavorful and the rice that came with it was very good, but the bed of wilted lettuce underneath the meat did nothing to enhance the dish.  If I were to order that again, I'd ask them to omit the lettuce.  Again, not bad, just not great.  

I'm willing to come back and try a few more dishes.  Maybe I'll discover a hidden favorite - you never know!  But, I'd skip the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Great local find. Curry, noodles and wings we're excellent. The staff was on top of it. Some of the best Thai food in the area. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great experience!   We had the chicken satay, tom yum soup, pad Thai and steak and chicken hibachi.  We thought everything was delicious.  Right amount of spice and flavor.  Service was great, returning several times to fill our drinks and make sure everything was ok.  I'm so glad this restaurant has opened in Indian Trail.   Menu had a nice variety of options.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from NY and was looking for an interesting place for lunch.  OUTSTANDING!  I had the beef pho and my husband had the pad thai.  Huge portions, perfectly spiced and super fresh.  Great little place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and friendly staff. Definitely be back! Wide variety to choose from..can't wait to try another great item on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was good, had the chicken pad Thai spice level 2.  Not too spicy.  Only three stars because the table service was lousy.  Waited 10 minutes before anyone even came for drinks. Then what felt like another 10 after that for the actual drinks. Once the food order was put in the food came pretty quickly.  But my food came before my kids, which is never good.  Not sure if we just hit them on an understaffed night or what was going on."}
{"text":"Chicken Pho is great lots of noodles and huge pieces of chicken-nice sides brought to add. Fried rice is delicious-portions are average. Spring rolls-4 pieces-good dipping sauce. 

 Store front off 74 does a huge carry-out business. Parking lot. Casual booths and tables-little decor but very clean."}
{"text":"Lame. To go order placed. Asked specifically about the starch on the curry dish. Got home, no rice. Called to tell them they said they would give me credit. No apology. The Tom Kha is literally the worst I've ever had. 8 dollar bowl of coconut milk and tomatoes. Pho was meh. Satay..okay. Pass on this place it is really not great."}
{"text":"I love this place. The beef pho is really, good. The best I've found in the Charlotte area, and I've been looking for a while. Spring rolls are also very good.  And I think it's homemade duck sauce. I do takeout and everything is still great by the time I get home. 
Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time since changing from Thai Viet. I have to say that the food was so much better and the service was amazing! I got the Mee Krob and spring rolls and then I took some Pho broth Togo.  The spring rolls were perfectly crispy and the dipping sauce which was a mix between fish sauce and sweet chili sauce was my favorite. The give you a large amount of Mee Krob and a large stack of lettuce. The Pho broth was the best I've ever had. I plan on coming back for my birthday dinner and many more meals."}
{"text":"Close to 5 stars but needs a bit of an upgrade inside and a bit more flavor in the pho, but still really great! I had the chicken with pho (pho ga) and they were very accommodating when I asked for half the amount of noodles and double the vegetables. Very mild but hit the spot with some extra soy and sriracha added. My husband got the sriracha wings and they were amazing, crispy and super sweet. The curry soup was a bit too sweet with only one shrimp but still nice to try, just don't get as your meal. We will be back to try more options again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with my daughter. We had the Pad Thai and Teriyaki Chicken . Hard to find but they just got a sign approved so it will be going up soon. Delicious...Highly recommend.  Make sure you get the spring rolls :-)"}
