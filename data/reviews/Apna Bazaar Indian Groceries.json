{"text":"Been here 3 times and all 3 times the store was not fully stocked. Not organized nor clean. The pictures they posted are deceiving...shelves were empty.  Not a huge choices of masalas compared to other Indian stores. I was not greeted by the staff... They were very cold. Smile goes a long way. Unfortunately this was the closet store to me but I will have to drive further out to another one."}
{"text":"Small store with all basic indian stuff, the staff are courteous and extended their time to accommodate us. I wish they carried more choice precooked food and veggies in the store"}
{"text":"Prices are significantly more than other stores in the valley. I had a feeling that prices are slightly more but figured out that a 5.99 value sold elsewhere is 7.99, that is 33% more than competition. Store is okay, owner is friendly but when buying more stuff I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went out of my way to drive out to this store only to find that they were low on stock on basically everything I needed to buy. They did tell me that they expected to restock the missing items at some point, but it was going to take way too long for me to wait around for it. Many of the items in store are overpriced and can be found for cheaper prices in other places. There is a small produce section in the back which is incredibly overpriced, very sparse, and not that great. I would recommend going to a different store if you actually want to be able to get everything you need in one go, particularly for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Simple store with basic indian groceries. Store is clean and staff are courteous. Items are pricey , minimum of 20% more than market price. I like the store except for the prices"}
{"text":"I was personally very pleased with my experience at Apna. While the store is small, it is jam packed with a ton of spices, produce, mixes, desserts, teas, and a good sized frozen section.   They are open Monday btw when most Indian markets are not.   The gentleman working the day I went was very friendly and very helpful. If I asked for an item he helped me find it, and if they were out he offered a suitable alternative to try and made other recommendations. After ringing me up he took my purchases out to the car for me without me even asking which I really appreciated being 7 months pregnant. He was also very polite and engaged me in conversation; genuinely excited for me and my experimenting with Indian cooking for the first time.   The quality and taste of all the ingredients was spot on and I am super excited to continue on this culinary route, especially knowing I have support from this locally owned business."}
{"text":"Good store with all basic Indian stuff will good quality. People's are awesome, store is awesome and prices are awesome"}
{"text":"My partner and I have been coming to this Indian food store since we moved to AZ about a year ago. They always have what we want and need. They may not be totally consistent with what they have in stock, but I have no issue with trying new things! Plus, whenever I ask for suggestions for things to try and make, the owner ( I'm assuming ) is always willing to offer advice with a friendly smile! We love being able to walk around the store and see the different sorts of goods. We will continue to support this business happily!   It's nestled in a random plaza with not much else around it. There's hardly ever anyone else in the shop - makes it easier to find what I want and need.  We used to live in Boulder. We shopped at one of the few Indian stores in town. We thought that we were getting a good deal - until we realized that the owner of that store charged us different prices for the same things each time we went there. We have not had any issue (and hope it stays that way) of that sort at Apna!   I definitely recommend this store!"}
