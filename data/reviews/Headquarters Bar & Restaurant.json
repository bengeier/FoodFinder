{"text":"HQ is close to being a 4 star for me, mostly because they have a fantastic tap beer selection, with at least 15 different taps that are always cold and fresh tasting. They are the only place in the area where I can get Great Lakes Elliott Ness on tap that I know of.   Their Wednesday night trivia is always worth the trip.   The food is so-so and a bit over priced especially for the area.   The staff is friendly but sometimes disorganized.   I'll definitely come back and look forward to being able to give it a 4 star rating in the near future. It's a newer place and there are some minor things they seem to be improving on."}
{"text":"I have been to HQ multiple times now and I hope to become a regular!  Buffalo Cheese Curds are the absolute best. Basically anything on the menu that is fried comes out perfectly crispy. The sandwich on the menu containing their smoked brisket and pulled pork, topped with cole slaw and bbq sauce is amazing! I've also been meaning to try their house smoked chicken wings! They also offer a number of wraps and salads for those on diets.   The bar area has plenty of flat screen tvs, good beers on tap, a pool table and dart boards. They can open everything up with big glass garage doors out to a large patio during the summer months.   Once or twice the service has been a little slow but the employees are mostly friendly and seem happy to have you there."}
{"text":"We've gone to Headquarters 3 times and I really want to like it, I really do! Oregon has so few restaurants so we were excited for another local option. But each time we've gone the food has really been lacking. The fries were not hot, they were rubbery and unattractive. All 3 times! I love chicken Caesar wraps but this was the most bland wrap I've ever had. I only gave two stars for atmosphere and service. We will never go again. Quality in food is severely lacking."}
{"text":"If you've been waiting for HQ to get over the \"new bar/restaurant\" hump, it's time to give it a try!  I've played volleyball at HQ this season so I've been a Wednesday night regular all summer.  The volleyball courts are great: awesome sand, no bugs, friendly refs, and their intermediate competition is good bump-set-spike volleyball.   I am a huge fan of the food.  Each time I sit down I can't believe the options and the reasonable pricing!  A few of my favorites:   Salads - Asian Salad (I had it with Steak) Appetizers - Buffalo Chicken Dip (it's like Super-Bowl-Sunday-good); served with tortilla chips and flat bread Entrees - Southwest Wrap, Turkey Melt (A friend of mine had it the week before and said it was a little dry so I got it with chipotle mayo), friends have also raved about the Touchdown Burger - I haven't tried it myself.  The place is always packed and I've watched the service improve tons since the grand opening chaotic phase. They've definitely got it figured out. Cheers guys, good job!"}
{"text":"Greasy cold eggs uncooked hash browns long wait times......but great service....sent food back got same food back...come on really?"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on a Friday night, the place was pretty busy but the server was still able to attend to us.  First the good:  Really nice big bar in Oregon that looks like it will be a fun place to watch football in the fall as it had a lot of tv's around.  The bar seemed to have a lot of beer choices, and although they were busy, it did not take long for us to get our drinks and the appetizer we ordered.  I really liked the cheese curds that we ordered.  The curds themselves tasted like they were fresh from the farmer's market.  Now the \"need's improvement\":  The server was nice, but my wife was trying to order some simple beers and it seemed that the server did not know much about what beers they offered.  She asked a few questions to the server which were met with \"I don't know answers\".  I know the bar is new, so I am hoping that soon the staff will be more familiar with their offerings.  I, on the other hand, ordered a simple Vodka and red bull.  The first one I ordered was a \"tall\" and it seemed to have a decent mix of alcohol to redbull, however the second one I ordered was a \"short\" as we were going to leave soon and I was wanting to take it easy.  This \"short\" was way over poured and tasted stronger than my \"tall\".  Now I know some might read this and say, \"that's great!\" but I prefer a well mixed drink and to not get blitzed like I was at Wando's, especially since the Oregon cops sit on double MM.  I foresee an uptick for OWI's in Oregon, and a loss in bar profits if they continue the heavy hand.  While the cheese curds themselves were good, the sauce to dip them was a simple store bought ranch dressing.  It would have been perfect if they had done just that extra step and created a custom dipping sauce to go with the effort they did to get a good curd.  Lastly, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, as we wanted to test their food a bit and it was so/so.  The wrap itself was large, but that was simply a wrap rolled up.  It would have been nice if the wrap actually folded the ends in on itself to make a better presentation,  The fries were the \"Bottomless\" fries, but they were not good and I would not have wanted a second helping.  They were mushy and dark brown.  My wife saw on someone else's plate some waffle fries and said that they looked better, but I can't attest to their taste.  Overall I think the place was ok for Oregon, but it can definately improve.  As it stands, I would rather drive to the Great Dane in Fitchburg if my wife and I really wanted good pub food."}
{"text":"Went to watch the Badger Bowl game and had terrible service.  Got one drink and waitress never came back. For 45 minutes. Table next to us sat down and left with no staff ever to come and acknowledge them.  Bowl game with the Badgers and under staffed so bad.  Left and went to other competitors location to have full lunch and great game experience.  Had others that came from HQ show up at same location because of bad service."}
{"text":"Wrote a review several months ago encouraging the owner to take a hard look at what he wants his restaurant to be. It doesn't look like he took my advice. Service remains a huge problem. I've got no issue with hiring teenagers but many need to be taught how to speak with adult customers. Politeness goes a long way. The menu remains limited, the facilities appear dirty, and every visit suggests nobody is actually in charge.   Oregon has new competition in the \"family restaurant\" business with the opening of Sonny's Kitchen, and I suspect that you're going to see fewer and fewer people coming here for breakfast and lunch. The sports bar business will continue to do well, but expect to see the dining room side suffer some more. I predict they'll stop offering breakfast during the week within 6 months."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  We go to HQ for lunch almost every weekend.  I don't think I've ever had a bad meal and everyone is so friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Headquarters is a great addition to Oregon, and our favorite place in nice weather. The food is pretty good, although if you're a nacho fan, this isn't your place. The Racer salad is great, the chicken po'boy is my husband's go-to item. Plus there are unlimited chips and fries! Waitstaff is friendly and attentive. The house mojito has no lime in it, which is weird, only one slice on the rim. One nice addition would be a gluten free menu, they seem to be pretty oblivious when you ask for one."}
{"text":"This is a 3 1/2 star establishment.   On one hand,  they have a long list of beers on tap and on the other,  the service can be spotty and we've heard the burgers are passable.   That's why we only order from the smokehouse menu our get sandwiches.  They really smoke their meets in an outdoor smoker. We've had the pulled pork and HQ sandwich.  Both had good,  smoky flavored meats,  and great flavor.   We've also had the buffalo chicken melt and Monetary ranch sandwich, both with crispy chicken. They were very good and the chicken had all white meat and consistent crispy breading throughout.   I'd say skip the wings for appetizers and go with the pulled BBQ nachos instead.  The wings had tough meat while other sections our wings were rubbery.  The HQ BBQ sauce was very good,  but just terrible chicken.   The good part of any sandwiches,  melts,  wraps,  our burgers would be the bottomless fries, waffle fries,  or parmesan chips."}
{"text":"Been here 3x in the last two months for various reasons. The main draw is their trivia on Wednesday nights; decent host and teams that are fair competition. Earlier in the fall, there were stellar beers on tap, most notably about a half dozen Oktoberfests! Even still, there are great beer selections. I haven't had \"real food\" here, but rather broccoli cheese soup, quesadilla, nachos. It was all fine. Unfortunately after the soup I started having stomach issues right away. Prices are reasonable unless you get the \"dinners,\" though they do sound more tempting than the worse bar food. Really nice but clueless staff; unsure about menu, coupons (i.e. drink book), deals (i.e. vet day). Regardless, probably a decent addition to Oregon and a nice sports bar if one really likes that. Very happy to see trivia in Oregon."}
{"text":"This is a hard one to review. I have a few things I've found here that I like very much, but probably only because it's conveniently located. My kids LOVE the cheese curds (they are quite good) and the kids meals. I like the grilled cheese with basil farmers cheese. I suppose I generally like this place better for lunch than suppers.   The reason I can't go higher than 3 stars is the service issues I've had the last couple times I went there. I went with my mother-in-law and young daughter on a non-busy weekday recently. We were seated and then completely ignored. It was bizarre. Other people were seated and got their drink orders while we tried to catch the eye of a server. How could they miss us with my 4 year old getting more and more ancy. At one point a server made eye contact but then just walked away. It was as though we'd been seated in no-man's land. Finally my mother in law went to the hostess stand to request a server. About 5 minutes later one came over but no apology or anything. Then at the end of the meal we waited forever for our check. To me it seemed like there was a lack of communication... Somehow no server had been told that we were in their section and so every single server was ignoring us. I went again for dinner with my husband and kids and though not as bad, once again, there was no rhyme or reason to who was getting service first. People who came in after us were waited on first. I just don't think they're tracking when people are seated.  Now, the atmosphere. I don't like the dining area at all. It's just boring and very open. Like a very small cafeteria. The bar area looks a little more happening but I've never eaten in there as they are high top tables and I always have my kids with me. The bar area seems popular with sports fans.  All in all, it's a decent restaurant to go to with kids who like basic American kid meals. It's the independently owned version of Applebee's or something like that."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going here. The good has always been what we have expected and the drinks are good as well. Sometimes service could be a bit more prompt, but never a huge delay."}
{"text":"HQ may be the nicest sports bar I have ever been in. Food is fabulous for a \" sports bar\" and the beer selection is amazing. Especially the nitro beers! Try the Hinterland IPA... You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Drink service at the bar is always good. The food is definitely hit or miss though. I've had some decent food here but a lot of items are sub par. The spinach and artichoke dip for example tasted like warm sour cream, with zero flavor. If they could spice up there food this place would be 10x better. The atmosphere is fun however, and I still enjoy coming here for drinks."}
{"text":"Impressed again. Mostly. We've been here a few times and the food is a step above bar food. House made sauces, smoked meats in house, hand battered cheese curds (highly recommend) and more. The ribs have great smoky flavor but did not fall off the bone at all. Onion rings are decent (expect corn meal/sandiness but good, sweet flavored onions). My husband got the fish fry and he said they drained it well and it was definitely delicious. I tried the tartar sauce and I liked it! Mostly just mayo, no vinegar or sweet pickle relish (finally!). He loved his waffle fries. I'm obsessed with their ranch. Service was great tonight. We had 2 different waitresses helping us out. The only thing was the older waitress forgot to put our curds in so they came after the entrees. We obv had to bring home boxes. Too much food at once. But better for our waistlines since we didn't eat as much as we would have if the curds came first. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, lots of places to sit, great place to watch sports, lovely outside seating (will soon be done) and drinks came out quickly.  Now for the bad - We ordered appetizers and three beers later still did not have our food. The place was somewhat busy but no one was being served. Our waitress said they had a big table in the other room they were trying to get served first. My husband went back that way and no one was eating in there either and didn't look to happy about it. By the time we were done with our 3rd drink we decided to go elsewhere. I'm sure we would give it another try as the bar area is really nice as was our waitress."}
{"text":"Many visits later and I'd say they're a 3 1/2 star establishment on a good day.  Service is hit or miss. Food is good at times and other times it sucks. They have screwed up our to go orders every other time. Not a consultant enough experience to warrant regular visits."}
{"text":"I have tried so hard to like HQ, but each time we go in it seems the place is getting worse.  Take our last visit for example.  We came in super hungry on a Tuesday, which tends to be a popular night with the discounted kid's meals.  We order drinks and appetizer (cheese curds).  The curds come out SUPER greasy, my husband wouldn't even eat them.  I patted a few dry for my daughter and I to eat just because we were starving at that point.  Our food order came and my husband ordered the Tacos (with it being Taco Tuesday).  He starts to pour the salsa on one of his tacos and out comes a huge long hair.  He points it out to the waitress and all she really says is that there was NO way it was hers, as she didn't prepare the salsa.  Honestly, we don't care who's it is, but an apology or something would have been nice.  She does eventually apologize when we got the bill but there was no compensation or anything taken off of the bill for the mishap.  I understand everyone has hair, and hair happens, but it's still pretty gross.  It just seems every time we go there is either an issue with the food or the service is slower than molasses on a cold winter day.  Although I would probably still go here for breakfast (I love their biscuits and gravy!), I don't think we will be visiting HQ for dinner or lunch any longer seeing how Banushi's is 7 miles down the road and amazing every time!"}
{"text":"I so wish I could write a good review here.....please.....please....please.....just based on the stuffed jalapeños....  Yeah...no and honestly I like HQ but something is wrong and it is called service.   Let put it this way...the food is mediocure at best and as I stated before...the stuffed jalapeños are AMAZING.  But seriously the service is TERRIBLE!   Should I run thorough a few situations?  CASE 1:  My wife, daughter, baby and I went to HQ for lunch.   We ordered appetizers and our meals.  By definition and appetizer is \"a small dish of food or a drink taken before a meal.\"   Keyword....before!   Yes, the appetizers and our meal came out at the same time.....PET PEEVE OF MINE BY THE WAY.  Oh wait...it gets better.  The manager offers to take our food away and make us new meals after we finish our appetizers.    Well, thats a waste and no...we have been here for 45 minutes....don't want to be longer.  Well, we ate and the food was eh as always but when the bill came there was no compensation, no apologies, nothing.     So if you were willing to throw out 3 meals and make them over but your not willing to compensate us somehow for a major issue.....whats up with that?  CASE 2:  So, we go to HQ another time and the asked for them to turn the NASCAR race on one of the TV's.   They do!    So after a hour of watching NASCAR and eating another table comes in and is loud as all sin.  The old man asks them to turn the same TV I was watching to a basketball (no, the the badgers) game and they do.....like right in front of me as I am watching the race.   Like...really?   he could not watch on the other 7 TV's in his view?   Well....their loss because we got up and left.  CASE 3: So we go to HQ on a non-sports day and without the kids.   This time we sat in the bar area just because we could.   Well, we sat....and sat some more.  and.....drinks...nope...we sat.    Finally I got up and ordered drinks form the bar and was told the wait staff would be right over........we sat and after 20 minutes they came and took our order.  Well....they got the Jalapeño appetizer right.   After a hour of waiting in a very non-crowded bar we got our food.  A HOUR!    Non-Sports day....hour.      Well, lets say this.  I like the place...Oregon needs restaurants badly as they have almost NONE but holy lord....some service would be amazing!   But...then again they do have great stuffed jalapeños."}
{"text":"We live in Oregon so have visited HQ a couple of times now. The food is well above what you would expect for bar food and the atmosphere is great. Service has always been good as well. Highly recommend the salmon pinwheels and buffalo cheese curds. Our new favorite place in town."}
{"text":"First let me say that as a sports bar, I liked it.  If you just want to go somewhere and catch a game, I have no complaints.  Plenty of screens, sound was great.  Good experience.  I would definitely not recommend the food here though.  I was there on a recent Badger away game Saturday night.  I ordered the salmon after asking the waitress how it was and she said the salmon is the same used on their sandwich and it's good.  So against my better judgement I went ahead and ordered that.  It came very dry and more fishy tasting than I would expect.  Very unpleasant and I sent it back.  I ordered from the Smokehouse section next as I was told it was very good...my brisket  was very dry...and bland...the extra $ for the parmesan chips on the side?  Definitely not worth it.  All and all the food was bad, the group I was with had mixed experiences.  The burgers looked very dry but I was told the wraps were good.  If you're hungry and don't care about paying good money for bad food but like the TV's and great outdoor bar...this is your place...though they did make a poor Vodka Seltzer the second time around...got the soda gun involved...had to send that back too and I promise, I am not usually like that!  but it was bad..."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. It is a good location and nice, newer building. Their nachos are very good, but I've also had some of their other menu items previously, and they haven't been all that good. It seems that their crowd varies, as I've been there many times on a Saturday night, and sometimes it's busy, and sometimes it's not. We like to go there for a few beers and an appetizer. That's what it's good for - not so much for a full meal."}
{"text":"If HQ could deliver a consistent dining experience,  I would give it 5 stars.  When they are on their game, it's a solid place to go in Oregon.   But their service and food prep staff are frustratingly inconsistent.  It's excusable in a one month old restaurant, so I kept going back, but things have not improved.   We've received macaroni that burnt to the bottom of the pan, and they decided to just leave the burnt chunks in when they served it.  Sandwiches without the sauce.  Waitresses who have no idea whats on tap.   And waffle fries that weren't waffles - just the leftover pieces at the bottom of the batch.  I sincerely hope management can take control and get the quality up because it is a great concept, a very nice building, and Oregon could use a good brew pub."}
{"text":"After experiencing not-so-good service and arrangements at Charlie's-on-Main, we were a little apprehensive, yet eager to try Headquarters. We were pleasantly surprised. We were seated right away and served right away. The brandy-old-fashion drinks were fabulous -- hand-mulled and full. I had the baked cod and my husband had the ribs. Whereas he doesn't prefer smoked ribs, he said they were good but would prefer them not smoked. Although the place doesn't have a cozy atmosphere, we enjoyed our experience overall and will definitely be returning . . . unlike Charlie's."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Service is usually pretty good. The food is just OK."}
{"text":"It seems like every time I come here, I become even more disappointed. Oregon, unfortunately, doesn't have any other place you can grab brunch and a bloody sooo here we were. There were three of us, very hungry, gals. The bloodys were great! The food was terrible. Raw hashbrowns, waaaayyy undercooked eggs, grease layer under it all. We actually left our food picked over, went home and cooked breakfast ourselves. Next time, I'll just run to the grocery store and save myself the time and money wasted on this place. The bar here is great!! But we'll never order food here again...ever."}
{"text":"The bigger and more popular of the few sports bars Oregon has now. Cool staff, lots of TV available for games. Dining area and sports bar area nicely divided. Good for groups or families wanting a sit down dinner or gang to watch the game and have drinks. Salad bar is pretty stocked and varied. For just +$3 if you get an entree it's worth it! The cod dinner is kinda lackluster as not much to it. The fish is good but small in portion and the garlic bread is very dry. The veggie I got was broccoli and it was doused in butter and a small serving. Prices are low so can't go wrong there. Our server landed us all $5 tokens to use later on in the future so I did like that little perk.   Fast service, great venue, good salad bar and good fish. Won't judge a place based on one single menu entree. My fellow dinning buddies meals looked awesome and they seemed very pleased as well. Nothing was left in the end so that says something."}
{"text":"Love going here, and often end up here at least once a week. We always sit at the bar because the bartenders are great.  They have lots of tvs for sports fans too. Definitely recommend the jalapeños, buffalo chicken dip, nachos, and grilled cheese (but everything we have here is yummy)!"}
{"text":"Poor value and poor service. This review is qualified by my 10years of restaurant service. I don't know the best place to begin. To summarize:  Restaurant half full maybe less.   Host stand abandoned. After waiting had to go into kitchen to find someone to help.   Took 10 minutes for someone to come to the table.   Took 15 minutes for drinks to arrive. Water included.   Food was ok.  Manager ended up serving.    At end she brought us the bill and apologized for the service.   What usually happens next?  Something off the bill. An entre comped?  NO. Nothing. She just rubbed my shoulder and told me they were having a bad night. Awkward and weird.   Eat anywhere else in town!!!!!  P.S. Forgot to include the capper:. The booth behind us ordered a spotted cow beer.  The beer the waitress brought was very dark, clearly not spotted cow (very light). The guy who ordered it pointed out this, and was told \"Well that's what came out of the tap!\", In a tone that was really rude.  The waitress offered to try a different tap for him to see if that was right..."}
{"text":"Here on a Sunday at lunch time BLT looked delicious. He said it was good. I had a buffalo blue wrap that was just the right amount of spicey.  The best though was the fruit bowl. Fresh and tasty with a great variety of fruit. I would recommend this place.  A little noisy."}
{"text":"Went to HQ last night for the first time, the girl that severed us was great then in the middle of the meal we were told our waitress had to leave so we got a new girl, I was fine with that but a few minutes later we see our waitress working and were a little confused. I needed my drink refilled and no one ever checked on us to see if we needed anything. The hostess saw we were kinda done with our food and checked in on us, she asked if we wanted our bill I said yes she apologize and said they got confused. Really confused to wait on someone especially the place had hardly any people in the dinning area. Never again will I go. My first impression on this place is horrible."}
{"text":"The Nacho's are great  and a good place to watch sports. The bar is really a fun place lots of tv"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at this restaurant yet and after my experience here I unfortunately do not think I'll be coming back ever. This is a newer bar to Oregon and we were excited for it to open and even more excited that they'd be starting summer volleyball league. We signed up right away and paid our $250 team fee. Even though there was a lot of communication between myself and the employee in charge of volleyball when it came time for the season to start he had forgotten my team completely. Had cashed our check but did not place us on Monday nights. The story goes on and on about me going in and talking to him about it and him saying he will redo the schedule. Basically the end of the story is they bit off more than they could chew on the volleyball end of things and have screwed a lot of people over. We got our money back but my team was disappointment in not getting to play. I'd like to suggest to HQ that next time you start a volley ball league only do one night first and as you learn and grow add more nights. You couldn't handle Monday - Thursday games. And I will not be coming back to play, dine, or drink at your establishment."}
{"text":"Inconsistent service, but consistently underwhelming.  The weather is lovely today, so we hoped to sit outside but were told food was not being served outdoors. It apparently, it was not being indoors either as it took an hour to get our food.  We were told when we arrived that it would be a 30 minute wait to be seated, unless we wanted to sit at the bar - and food was not being served outdoors. There were about three tables in the bar area that were available but dirty.   Our server told us the food wait was longer than usual because there were a few large groups. One large group left as soon as we sat down. The other large group was eating cake.   Our food taking one hour to arrive was unexpected and uncalled for since half the indoor seating area was empty, and no one was outdoors. We've been here on Friday nights where it's packed and the food arrived much faster.  The food was also not good. On past occasions it's been delicious though.   The food and service are so inconsistent that I cannot give them more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Average would be a step up. Better options in town.  Food not memorable and when the best thing is a bottle of beer you know that you made a poor choice. Not worth the drive in from Madison."}
{"text":"Great overall food and a good presentation. Cool atmosphere with many TVs. Good place for lunch."}
{"text":"HQ is HUGELY popular- I arrived yesterday, a blistering hot Wednesday, at 6:30 to find the parking lot full and almost every seat occupied. I continue to patronize because it is really fun and the crowd is younger active people.   On a recent trip we had STELLAR service from a platinum blonde young lady. She was friendly, pleasant, stopped often and was on her game.  I hoped her style would be infectious, but last night's experience didn't show it. Seated at the bar it was difficult to order another drink, as the bartender wouldn't acknowledge guests until they literally flagged her down. Stony personality came with each interaction.   Food was a split decision. The burger was a bit overdone but ok, \"smoked\" items were bone dry and leathery. Avoid that section of the menu.   I'm glad people head here in droves. I wish the rest of the experience warranted it."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner and I was surprised to see how much homemade things they had. Such as the make their own fried cheese curds, jalapeno poppers, and onion rings. I will have to go back and try some more things. They also have a great selection of local beers on tap."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Wednesday evening between 5 and 6. The food was top quality, service excellent. Couldn't have asked for anything more. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends."}
{"text":"Still subpar service. Stuffed grilled cheese served without all ingredients, after alerted to this..provided a plate with missing ingredients. Now with a cold sandwich. Gross. Next time, I will cook at home."}
{"text":"I ordered their perch dinner, it was super yummy, however the waitress we had was phony, slow, and inattentive.  Would have been at least 4 stars if it wasn't for her.  Great food and drinks though!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. The employee treat us bad because we are black. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Quick version....the food was great!  American pub/gastro.....the ribs, barbeque and brisket were all excellent.  The sides were good classics, pub chips, fries and coleslaw.  It's hard to find good slaw...theirs was very good.  Nice place, the atmosphere is fun, friendly, sports, pub.    Service....oh snap.....not good.  Bad, actually.  Young waitress, distracted, no idea of what is appropriate and expected in a work environment.  We do NOT want to hear you talking about your underwear with friends, who doesn't wear it, or being ignored...waiting to pay, because you're distracted talking with a cute boy who came in.  Guess what....he hasn't ordered ANYTHING.  we were the paying customers at your restaurant for a mother's day dinner.  And THAT IS WHY your tip was lame...because so was your attitude and service.  Other than that....it was a great place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times.  It's usually pretty average.  Tonight the server was very attentive and the food seemed to come out fresh.  In the past service lacked.  I tried the buffalo cheese curds and they were awesome!"}
{"text":"6 months later.  Same screw ups. Doesnt feel like food ever gets served, doesnt feel like they ever have customers.  Lousy.   Got dragged here.  Not gonna try again"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to HQ's a couple of times now. The place is beautiful, clean and friendly staff. Our latest dining experience was Sunday around 5:30pm.  The place was busy, no busier than most popular restaurants I would think on a Sunday evening. We ordered both the buffalo and regular cheese curds. Both are fresh and mouthwatering but I would agree that a better dipping sauce would be more exciting. My husband ordered a bowl of chili, which never came.  Service, although nice people, was slow - perhaps understaffed that there's no time to ask if you need anything....I'm thinking no improvements from most of THE TOWNS' restaurants.  Our burgers were overcooked, we ordered them medium rare. The burger meat was crunchy. My son ate his as he was starved, but I sent my back only to receive the same. We do enjoy their burger choices, when not overcooked they are awesome. The cowboy burger is my FAV. A pretzel roll would be tasty. My son loves the DEAK burger. The sweet potato fries were served cold but filling as I waited for another burger. My husband did enjoy his buffalo chicken salad, and our daughter liked her chicken salad wrap, although the fries were also served cold and definitely lack something.    Since the service was pretty slow, my family left me to pay the bill so they could go home. I noticed the bowl of chili on the receipt (the bowl we never got) and asked to have that removed. I was told that they were out of chili and asked if I would take home chowder instead...huh?  I politely declined and asked to have it removed which she did.  Although there could be some improvements for our liking, we will come back to HQ's - It's got potential. The beer choices are awesome. I do want to mention that their bartenders could be more attentive. A good bartender should notice when you need another round, right?"}
{"text":"First time with my family at Headquarters. We thought the food was great actually, very decent. I had the brisket sandwich, the bun was toasted and the brisket was tasty with the BBQ sauce on it, nice touch with the slaw on the sandwich as well. I got the garlic parmesan chips w/house made onion dip and they were delicious. My wife got the blackened ahi sandwich and she said that was tasty.   We thought the service was good, our waiter was younger and he did forget the bring my wife's tea over but that's no biggie.  Overall, good looking place and good food."}
{"text":"So sorry to say that they did not get any order right for any of the 5 of us. Some food was cold, some looked old."}
{"text":"A spin-off of Deak's in Stoughton, Headquarters bills itself as a Gastropub--a fine beer selection, with even better food.  The menu is the same as Deak's, but they're smoking their own meats at HQ, and the cheese curds are amazing.  I will be going back as often as I can."}
