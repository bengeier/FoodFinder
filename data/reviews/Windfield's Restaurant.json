{"text":"I can't understand the reviews below, sure it's outdated but the food is fantastic. Very good comfort food at good prices. It's hard to find a place where a family can sit in a restaurant without loud music blasting at the table making conversation impossible. Lunch is busy during the week days. The house special for lunch \"soup and sandwich\" $ 6.99 best deal in the area. Soup is always homemade. Breakfast is by far the best. You can Order breakfast all day. The eggs benedict is the best in Toronto, no fancy flowers made of fruit on the plate, just good old fashion breakfast. The sauce is tasty with parmesan browned on the top. The poached eggs are always the way you order. The old gals have an opinion on everything just ask."}
{"text":"Food - 3 Service - 1   Just as other Yelpers pointed out, the restaurant is old. It seems like they didn't renovate the restaurant for 15-20 years. The price is decent, not cheap but not expensive. When I tried the pasta, it was good but there was nothing special about it. The service was 2.5/5 but I'm going to deduct some points.   Here's my complaint:  One day, I was just passing the restaurant to go to RBC which is in the same plaza. All of the sudden, manager/owner came out of the restaurant started yelling at me because she thought I parked at the restaurant's parking space. UMMMM.. I didn't drive to go to RBC; I walked. When I told her, the manager/owner just stormed back into the restaurant..WITHOUT APOLOGIZING. From that day, I never returned to Windfield's Restaurant. I didn't want anymore service or food from rude people."}
{"text":"Decent food and decent prices.  Family run restaurant.  Decent selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner options.  Seems like a bit of a staple in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This family run Greek style restaurant has been in business for 40 years for a good reason! Every dish is good and comes with impressive portion and low prices. A bit of everything is sold here. So far I've had burger, fish and chips, souvlaki, lamb, seafood chowder, breakfast, wings, salad and so on and such, for which I have nothing but praises.   Service is stellar. We are always treated with warm hospitality like part of the family. The restaurant looks dated but it is always clean showing the family's commitment to the business! Lots of regulars come here including me and my parents so foods are always guaranteed to be good as they don't want to drive us away and they are appreciative of our patronage!"}
{"text":"Going to this place is like diving into a time warp - faded decor, stale carpets, cane & walker dependent clientele.  It's not meant to be insulting or ageist but upon entrance to the restaurant it feels like living a relic of history back a few decades ago.  At the same time I was told from independent sources that it's a family owned business that manages to hang in over decades in sea changes. I have also heard good reviews about this place thru word of mouth in accidentally and unexpected contexts. I have also accompanied older folks on a few occasions here when this place remains their favourite one.  During those occasions - I think the food is competent at a competitive price point. Service is excellent without being intrusive. Overflow parking available at the back is a bonus but generally not a problem in the area anyway. If one can get over its retirement home ambiance (which I managed to - if food is the main item of consideration) I think Windfield's punches above its weight.  The garlic bread was decent - and on the house -- but you can order more -- essentially all you can eat. I thought that was quite generous. And I find that bread more than adequate and have no complaints vs other finer restaurants around the area.  I have tried their NY steak as well as roast beef. The NY steak that I order is often made/defaulted more Chicago style and medium rare and which I appreciate.  I have had the roast beef on one occasion which was overcooked and without hesitation the waitress got one for me another piece which was medium to medium rare.  I was told by my party however that pork chops have been consistently overcooked and on the tough side and dry. Fries were just mass-produced frozen fries. The drink menu is limited but not restrictive but given the venue never expected this to be a wine cellar. Desserts are on par with better establishments based on feedback and having tried it thought were decent.    In the end it's competent niche, and offers a wide selection of comfort food for a tailored demographic. The nit-pickings described certainly are not fatal. If only a background lullaby were in play this could be escape heaven - a non-chic inner sanctum within an increasing busy and frantic Toronto that could put even the most serious diner to snooze."}
{"text":"Whoa, really dated decor...They need Restaurant Makeover STAT! It's like the set of the Golden Girls!   I think the food has gone downhill, our fav's were hot turkey sandwichs and roast beef dip.  They are better than most family restaurants in toronto though.   Toronto has great high end restaurants but it's hard to find a good middle of the road, family restaurant, beside chains like Kelsy's and Swiss Chalet both are steps away. I find the staff very cold and not that friendly.  Most times they hardly speak.  There is a little guy that just runs around like crazy but doesn't seem to accomplish much.  Maybe if we were Greek.    We used to go a few times a month but now I once or twice a year.  I work a block away so it's kind of sad.  Our crowd at work has just stopped going."}
{"text":"Windfield's is always consistent.   Great service and food.    We had the breakfast special this morning.   We felt as we were at home."}
{"text":"Warning: DON'T go to this restaurant if you have kids. This \"family\" restaurant is anything but. I went for lunch today with my young children and their friends (there were 6 kids and 3 adults).  From the moment we walked in we were met with rolling eyes and comments like \"oh sis we pick the wrong place\"! Then we were asked to keep the noise down when the restaurant was full and VERY noisy already. The icing on the cake was when a customer came over to the table and proceeded to tell us how to parent our children. We all got up and left and will never return. My friends and I have been eating there for over 20 years and am disgusted at the discrimination we received today. If this were a fancy or quiet venue I would agree with them but the reason we chose this place was due to the fact that it has always been a family restaurant. Bye bye windfield's."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Windfields for years.  It is a family restaurant in both terms of who owns it and who works and eats there.  They welcome little kids, and the staff is friendly.  The food is not five star dining, but it is good and satisfying.  The menu is varied and surprisingly broad.  I recommend the souvlaki.  Some people have knocked is as being old.  It is, but it has character.  It is not the plastic experience of some random chain restaurant.  If that is what you want (and who would you) go elsewhere.  Summary:  Good honest food.  Good Price.  Feel valued as customer.  No gimmicks.  I think you should try it.  Go for the Souvlaki."}
{"text":"This is a breakfast review.   Plain and simple do not go here if you enjoy your food.   The eggs Benedict was a joke.  The ham was the size of Manitoba, the eggs runny like the Nile river and overall very weak.  The Mediterranean omelettes were burnt and flat of taste. Fake peaches, fake maple syrup for the French toast.     Overall a very poor bunch.  Service was quite OK."}
{"text":"I have been coming here frequently and is now my favourite new coffee spot. The waitresses know my family now so they always reserve a corner booth for us. For those who really like their breakfasts, as in all day breakfast, you can do no wrong with the 3 egg with sausage/bacon/ham combo and potatoes. Add to that a nice strong hot cup of coffee and let the day slowly unfold.  As per my previous review, regulars are abundant here, but I can see why. At the end of the day, despite the food being good, it's not WOW, but rather, you come here for that warm service. I don't mind being called Hun and sweetheart by an elderly lady...especially if that comes with a warm slab of apple pie.  My dad on this occasion had the spaghetti bolognese which is just the perfect balance of tomato and meat. For the Sunday brunch, we decided to order our individual meals plus order a side of fluffy pancakes. Perfect to share for 3 people.  This place is really homey and is not expensive. Comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for a quick lunch during my break since it was close to my work and I suppose it's a decent restaurant. It had a surprisingly large menu and the prices weren't too pricey, but I wouldn't consider it as cheap either. I ordered the chicken quesadilla, and although it is under starters, it is definitely filling enough to serve as a meal. Overall I thought the quesadilla was pretty good. Very good portion, and strangely enough it had a sweetness to it which actually turned out well for me. It also comes with 3 dippings: salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. Frankly, I only stuck with the sour cream b/c the guacamole tasted bad and looked unappealing, and the salsa was quite literally shrimp cocktail sauce.  My boyfriend got the fettucine alfredo, and it wasn't very good. The alfredo sauce had a weird test to it that didn't taste like a typical alfredo sauce. However, although the dish doesn't look very big, it was actually very filling, but nonetheless I was not pleased by the poor presentation of the dish. It was quite literally just pasta in a bowl, no garnish or anything. There wasn't even parmesan cheese or pepper on type, so it looked quite bland.  Overall, I would probably come here for a quick lunch for convenience sake. It's a pretty average restaurant, nothing in particular for me to hold against them, but nothing really for me to want to return all the time either."}
{"text":"You may initially come here because parking for the Swiss Chalet is full.  But you'll come back because the food is simple and good and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"We were impressed more on our second visit. The first one had gone fine, but we returned with 2 hungry young men-the grandsons! As soon as we stepped through the door, the boys were handed colouring books and crayons. Well that took care of their entertainment.  The food is genuine, well prepared and tasty. The owner is Greek, and is proud of what the kitchen puts out. We ordered grilled cheese sandwiches with fries for the boys, and I had my favourite: a Greek Village Salad. My wife had a hamburger, which she said was tasty and well prepared. The fries were excellent and the service was great.   The decor is a bit dated (Equine-Windfield Farms??), but the place is super clean and inviting.  It seems to be largely a family affair, and the devotion and effort show immediately. This is a good place to take the kids and/or grand kids. They will have a good time and will like the food.  We will probably take the boys there almost every time they visit. We all liked it!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised. The place was mostly empty when we arrived so I was a little apprehensive. However, the service was quick and friendly and the food was good. The western omelettes were huge with a generous side of potatoes. The sausage seemed homemade and was great. We enjoyed our meal here and I'd recommend it for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Staff is very helpful and friendly. Breakfast potatoes were not very good and the peameal bacon was dry. Rest of the breakfast was very good. Bagel with cream cheeae close to 5 dollars but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"For the 18 years that I lived in the area, I had never stepped foot inside of Windfield's. I had always heard about this restaurant and had driven past it numerous times. For the 30 years that my dad had lived in the area, he had never been here either. We finally decided one night to see what it was all about. Granted that Windfield's has been around since the dawn of the earth, there had to be something special about here.   Needless to say, we were both extremely disappointed. I got the french onion soup with the veal parm. My dad got the AAA roast prime rib of beef (Medium rare) with the soup of the day.  Both soups were average. Nothing special about it but nothing to complain about either. It's hard to mess up french onion soup and Windfield's was able to maintain that standard. Sadly, my veal parm was below average. There was a lot more spaghetti than there should have been and the spaghetti was overcooked and didn't taste like it had been seasoned properly when cooked. The tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The veal parm was also pretty below par as well and didn't have much seasoning to go along with the canned tasting tomato sauce.  My dad's prime rib came out medium well to well done and was pretty chewy. There also was little to no seasoning on it as well.   By then, I was pretty disappointed but figured that maybe their large selection of desserts that they had showcased in front would be good. I ordered an apple pie while thinking that this could be really good because it looked really good. Sadly, I was let down again.   For an establishment that has been around since the dawn of time, I was very disappointed. It took my dad 30 years of living in the area to finally go there and took me 30 years of my life to finally enter there. Sadly, it will take another 30 years before my dad or I go back."}
{"text":"Great all around menu. They have everything (Canadian, Greek, Italian) just to name a few. If I'm not sure what to eat around my area this place is the place to go since their menu is so vast.   Portions are massive with great prices. Service could be better but most of the staff is older so it's expected."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever.  My friend loves coming here when he's in town.  I probably come here once a year.  The souvlaki is pretty good.  I got for the pork, and he gets the lamb.  It really gets busy around lunch time.  We were here around noon, but by 12:30pm it was packed.  There's parking out back as well as in front.    Right now there's a lot of construction in the area, so give yourself extra time to get there.    The seats were spacious, I was able to fit a car seat on the bench with me, in case anyone is looking for a child-friendly eatery, this definitely qualifies."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the home made soup and the Greek salad was amazing! All the food our group ordered was very good, and large portions. Great service and reasonable prices. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"We found this place by using Yelp and were pleasantly surprised my husband and I ordered the special and the order was done perfectly coffee was great except we had to ask waitress 4 times for creamers thankfully person at next table obliged finally got creams from waitress with our check, we will go back again probably one of the best breakfasts ever."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and thought I'd give it a shot cause I was in the area.   The venue itself is super nice for a diner. It's got a horse racing theme, which I personally don't understand but it it is modernized and clean.   Unfortunately the service was extremely slow. The entire breakfast experience took about an hour and change and the place was extremely empty.   The food though was quite good. I ordered the Mediterranean omelette (egg white) - worked out to about $14. Had green and red peppers, mushrooms, onions and feta cheese. It was served with home fries and toast.   Although it was good in flavour, it was not worth $14.   Coffee was an extra couple bucks taking the bill up to about $20 including tax and tip.   Service speed, quality, and price are not balanced.   Decent place if you want to drop a pretty penny on an average breakfast."}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood last evening, so we stepped into this neighbourhood gem by chance.  Oh, I really enjoyed this accidental encounter.  This is a neighbourhood family restaurant hidden in a strip mall.  The outside looks unassuming.  There are many \"Best of 2YYY\" decals at the entrance, ensuring visitors that this is a good place.  The interior decor is dated but clean (nothing is broken).  The service is friendly though not the quickest.    We ordered fish & chip ($14), halibut steak ($17) and calamari ($10).  They all tasted good and of rather generous portion.  The calamari was about 50% more than a regular portion.  The halibut steak was delicious and came with lots of broiled vegetable.  The fish and chips were crispy fried.  Oh! I was very impressed by the potatoes.  Please try their roast potatoes and fries.  We had so much leftover that my BF's next dinner was taken care of.  All in all, we loved the meal."}
{"text":"This definitely is a restaurant that attracts the geriatric BUT it is pretty much your standard diner fare. French onion soup was surprisingly tasty and I enjoy the burgers. I think it's worth coming for breakfast especially since Cora's across the bridge is far more pricey (but quality and presentation surpasses Windfield's). Do not order the Benny! I don't know why in god's name I thought ordering eggs Benedict from here was a feasible idea; yolk was not runny at all and pretty much resembled the yolk of a boiled egg. Hollandaise sauce was goop.   Stick with what you would typically order at a diner."}
{"text":"Had their all day breakfast and it wasn't bad.  Mind you, it's hard to mess up on a breakfast meal of eggs, sausage, peameal bacon, homefries & toast.  You get more bang for your buck here as the portions are very kind.  Only one visit, but I'll return."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Apparently it was owned by the legendary horse racing stable Winfield farms. This is a must visit for any Canadian horse racing fan - this would be the equivalent to Wayne Gretzky's. Food was great, service was great, and prices were very reasonable. Portions were very large. Decor looks like its from the 70's but its very well maintained. Definitely coming back here. In terms of what we ordered:  Mussels - excellent Chicken souvlaki - great Prime rib - no good, dont order this Garlic bread - excellent Steak and shrimp fajitas - steak not so good, shrimp was excellent  Seems like they aren't too good with their beef, but everything else was great."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Sunday brunch at Windfields. This is a family run restaurant that takes the time to get to know each and every customer that walks in the door.  I had been here maybe a year ago for dinner and they remembered me! That says a lot.  Great service from the wait staff and the owner took time to come sit with us for a few minutes as we finished our meal.  They really go above and beyond to make you feel welcome.  The regular menu (lunch/dinner) is quite extensive so I was a bit disappointed when the brunch menu was so tiny. But fear not!  Anything you want - they will make whether its on the menu or not!  So I had an amazing omlette (came with a gigantic plate of home fries and toast) but not one of the ones on the menu. No extra charge for adding/changing ingredients - who does that in this day and age?  Fantastic!!    The breakfast specials are really good deals (juice/coffee/eggs/meat/potatoes) and the portion sizes are hefty. I couldn't even remotely finish my meal.  So make sure you are hungry!  The place gets packed with regulars so suggest coming early or making a reservation.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised no-one has actually reviewed this place yet.  I guess it's just an overlooked gem. Been eating here for years on and off. Never been disappointed.  They have a menu for all price range so weather on a budget or not you can get a filling meal. Everything from appetizers, pasta, Hot sandwiches, to Lamb and seafood to Late night Deserts. Guess i've made my way through the menu over the years and have yet to find anything i didn't like. If you come for breakfast you get the same gargantuan portions you get for lunch or dinner. They Use huge plates and don't leave much open space on them.  If your looking for a good place for family casual dining this is it. Most people i've ever brought there still go there many years later. I guess it's a testament to the value and consistency of the food."}
{"text":"Dinner is way overpriced for what you get. Had the hot roast beef. Gravy was not real beef gravy and there was too much of it. Roast potatoes are good which made me think that I should have stayed in the Greek part of the menu. Salads are crazy expensive and no small side salad option. Garlic bread was good and typical of what you get at Greek restos.  Service started out good but slipped dramatically as the night wore on.   I hear it's better for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after many years of living in the area. What a disappointment! The food was tasteless & overcooked, and the service is just \"ok\". I don't understand how this place is packed sometimes. If you want large portions of \"average\" food that tastes like it came out of the package, then this is the place for you. If you actually like to taste your food and enjoy your eating experience avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"Went there for my 1st time during the week for breakfast. The server was friendly but forgetful & often rushed away before you were finished talking.  Very casual place.  The breakfast special is good value for $10 The orange juice served with the breakfast special tastes like bad frozen concentrate. This is probably the worst part of the breakfast special. Thus the 3 stars awarded."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss, as it kind of gets lost amidst all of the other chain restaurants nearby. Although this little family restaurant is mostly (and almost exclusively it seems) frequented by a 50+ crowd, its become a comfortable option for me when looking to fill the belly.  The place serves a range of food options, including souvlaki, pastas, stir-fry, pub food etc. Although one of their popular items, I am not a fan of their souvlaki - a bit too dry and bland for my taste. The toasted garlic bread is worth a try at Windfield's.  What I've returned here for is their Philly Hoagie (Cheesesteak). How can you not love a buttered bun filled with hearty chucks of actual steak; jammed with sauteed peppers, onions, and mushrooms; and topped off with loads of baked mozzarella?    The servings here are quite large - expect to be filled, and them some! Service has been friendly each time I've been here."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a go again since everyone goes on and on about their breakfasts. Clearly from my last experience I thought maybe take out wasn't the way to go, maybe eating in was. I was wrong!!! Clearly the reason why everyone in the place is under 6 or over 60, because both generations care nothing about food quality. I took my friend out for breakfast.. Took 10 minutes to bring us coffee. Ordered a large juice, and got a 6 oz glass of juice. If that's the large then how small is the small? 3 oz? At 3 something a glass I would hope for more than that. We both ordered the eggs benni and a side of bacon. Bacon came cold, like it was fried the day before and sat in a pan under the heating light, and our eggs were over cooked. Hard to the point where I had to use a knife to cut them. Couldnt let the amazing yolk run down. The sauce tasted strongly of mayo, not sure what they were thinking there, and the \"home fries\" we're not home fries at all, but boiled potatoes that had been half mashed and topped with paprika.. Maybe to suit the clearly regular old people who can't chew hard things.. The bill came to 40$ which I thought was high price for cold bacon, undersized juice and half mashed potatoes... This place is clearly a joke and meant for the elderly. The staff focused more on the tables around us then us, and left a bunch of dirty plates piling up on the table beside us..like that was their drop off station instead of taking them to the kitchen. I guess that's how they clear tables there... I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this little gem on Yorkmills. My mom had introduced me to this restaurant a while back and whenever we are deciding on where to go for dinner we always end up choosing here. I have been here many times with my parents and I can't get over the home feeling I receive when I walk through the door. Everything on the menu is Amazing. Prior to arriving and even when I am there I can never decide on what to order. Takes me a while because I know whatever it will be it will be delicious. They also serve fresh garlic bread before every meal on the house. The portion size of any meal here is out of this world big and the only problem with that is the food being so good you just want to finish everything on your plate. All the servers are friendly and never make you feel rushed in anyway. Being a somewhat regular (every few months) I still receive the same level of excellent service from the first day I dined their until till now."}
