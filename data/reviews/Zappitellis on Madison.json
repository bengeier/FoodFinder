{"text":"Loved their pizza -- fresh, tasty, high quality. Yummy crust! It's not cheap but it's worth it. Sorry they closed."}
{"text":"Dined in here for lunch today with some old work friends. We got a large vegetarian pizza, half white sauce and half red sauce on pretzel crust. It was so delicious!  We all really loved it.  I can see why it was voted best pizza.   We also each got a house salad which was good. Since it was a Monday and they get most of their deliveries in Tuesdays they didn't have iceberg lettuce but substituted spinach instead, which was no problem.   The owner and his mom were both super nice and friendly and we really had a great experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious every time! The staff is consistently friendly and enthusiastic. I've lived a couple blocks away from this location for 20 years and have watched many different pizza places come and go, with none of them being good enough to earn my loyalty. Our family ends up ordering something from Zappitelli's at least once a week. Their pizza crust is perfectly chewy and crispy, and the ingredients are always fresh and flavorful. We're happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I grew up believing with an almost holy resonance that pizza from that other guy down the street who shall not be named was the holy grail of all pizza, anywhere, ever. Now, I'm not saying that this pizza \"beats\" that pizza, because, let's be honest they are two very different styles. But, Zappitellis certainly is going to give the institution down the street a run for their money.   My beau, my mom, my stepdad and I went here for an Italian feast that truly reminded me of my time in Italy.  The food seemed to never stop coming, and the portions were enormous. They brought out rolls and olive oil with seasalt for dipping and crunchy cheese bread. The pizza we ordered had a thin, crispy crust that was packed with fresh toppings and tangy sauce. They insisted we tried the meatballs, and brought out an order of their pasta with homemade vegan sauce for my vegetarian boyfriend and I, an order of pasta with meat sauce that they just wanted us to try and 4 gigantic homemade meatballs. We then went completely overboard and got an order of rolled eggplant.   The orders of food were all enormous, fresh and tasty. The service was kind, and the owner was incredibly proud and sweet. The space is small, but they are just getting started. A few less tables in the room would give a little more room to digest all that delicious food we just scarfed down. Remember what that other guy was in that tiny space too?   Bottom line: the food is amazing. And I can't wait to eat it again for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Finally a spot on the west side with vegan pizza!  I'm so excited.  My friend and I ordered a medium vegan \"Pizza of Champions\" for takeout- it was pretty great.  Thin crust, just enough Daiya cheese, crispy greens, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, and it was the perfect amount of pizza.  The place is really small- I think they call this their \"express\" location; I don't know that I'd be interested in dining in.  It's definitely a family business; everyone in there was chatting with us and some guy showed up with an accordion.  After awkwardly playing in front of the register, he asked us \"what more could you want?!\"  Overall, a pleasantly bizarre service experience and a delicious pizza :D."}
{"text":"Sorry y'all. Pizza is not the best in Lakewood. Not even close!  Don't think I'll be ordering from them again. Just not a fan of the way the food tastes. But you may think differently depending on your taste buds."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Zappitelli's for a while... I finally ordered some food to-go this weekend.  We ordered the eggplant parm and a medium cheese pizza.  At first, I thought the pasta prices seemed a little high, but the portions are HUGE, and you get salad & a roll.  It was easily 2+ meals for me... and delicious!  I'm not very adventurous with pizza, but I thought the cheese pizza was really good, and reasonably priced, too.  Lastly, the cannoli... Oh, the cannoli.  Overfilled and delicious!  I will definitely be ordering food again!"}
{"text":"I prefer not to give a review that isn't positive.  But unfortunately, it is apparent that Zappitelli's on Madison has some work to do.  I think they might be understaffed and have some communication problems.  I have ordered from them more than once (hoping that the first order fiasco wouldn't happen again).  However, they have problems with delivery (if you get your order at all) and they have made mistakes on all my orders as well.  I really hope that they can get it together and become successful."}
{"text":"Zappitelli's was clearly not ready for business when they opened their doors. From the start, it's conceptually all wrong. Located in a tiny little shop that used to house another pizza joint there is very little room to move and there is absolutely no effort put into the decor. Yet despite this, they want to charge $15.95 for Chicken Parmigiana and $17.95 for Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. These are prices you expect to pay at a more upscale restaurant, not in a lobby with 3 tables designed for customers to pick up their carryout orders. For that price I expect, at the very least, a tablecloth and napkins.  As for the quality of these overprice entrees, I couldn't tell you. We could not get served. My wife heard about the new place and as Lakewoodians we were super excited to have a new Italian place to try. Should have kept going when I saw the place (or lack thereof) but we went inside anyway. No one greeted us. We sat down at one of the 3 tables in the restaurant. There was only one other group and they seemed to consume the entire attention span of the one \"waitress\" who was also in charge of answering the phone, which never stopped ringing. We sat at our table for 10 minutes without so much as a hello as the \"waitress\" took 3 trips to bring out the other table's salads (and a separate trip to bring their dressing.) Again, not so much as a bit of eye contact from her. Then the phone began ringing. I could hear her conversations and they were all customers calling in to complain that their delivery orders were wrong. That was red flag number two.   About this time a woman walked by us with a delivery bag and apologized for the wait and promised us the \"waitress\" would be with us shortly (about 15 minutes have now gone by, not even an offer for drinks) She ;eft with her delivery and I watched the girl at the counter take another phone call and then grab a pop out of the cooler and walk into the back. That's when we had had enough and we out our coats on and walked out.   The other night we decided to give them another try and order pizza fro delivery. I mean they did win some award for \"Best Pizza\" so why not give them a go, right? I ordered a large pizza, half pepperoni and half plain cheese. The girl on the phone told us it would be an hour wait for delivery. After ordering I realized I didn't have any cash so, knowing we had an hour, my wife ran up the street to the Giant Eagle (a 30 second car ride from my house) to get soda and cash. Fifteen minutes later the driver arrived with the pizza (45 minutes early.) My wife had not gotten back yet and the driver gave me a ton of attitude and went to wait in his car for my wife to return. I explained to him that we were told an hour so we thought we had plenty of time. Well I guess I ruined his night based on the level of anger he displayed.   But at least I would finally get to try this award winning pizza, right? After all this drama, the pizza was as average as I have ever tasted. In fact we didn't finish it and threw away half of the large pizza because it was just so underwhelming I had no desire to eat anymore. The two slices on my plate were enough for me to know it wasn't worth the caloric intake.  Based on the poor (or should I say nonexistent) service and really bad pizza I see no reason to return to Zappitelli's on Madison. To me they seem in over their head. They have a young girl (I assume a daughter of the owner) running the phones and \"waiting on tables.\" She seemed overwhelmed and under qualified. The food is subpar and the building does not lend itself to or resemble in any way an eat in restaurant, at least not for the prices they are asking.   I do not see Zappitelli's open this time next year."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good pizza places in the Lakewood area so if you're trying this one, make sure and order off of the \"specialty pizza\" menu so you can experience their best. Loved \"The Twist\", made with beer cheese sauce and pretzel dough crust!"}
{"text":"This pizza is good (definitely better than Angelo's, which I don't care for), but nothing ridiculously amazing. The employees are very nice, and the cheese on the pizza had a really good/interesting flavor. I do think I'll try it again sometime."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, satisfying pizza. I saw the grand opening special for $1.50 a slice, the slice itself was small, but I want more! That really hit the spot!"}
