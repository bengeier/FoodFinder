{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars now that they make sandwiches.  Normally I go for their amazing selections of cheeses and meats, as well as Vegemite :) and other international specialty goods."}
{"text":"I never really understood what was meant by \"a cheese shop that smells like God's feet\" until I set foot in this store. I believe I got a smoked Gruyere which blew my mind."}
{"text":"Best Coffee in Then Main  I stopped drinking coffee about 15 years ago, and to be honest I don't even remember why I took that decision in the first place.   It wasn't until recently, after landing an overnight job and needing  extra help to stay awake, that I started to drink it again. But now, that I got the coffee bug in me, I only wanna drink a good \"Cafe au lait\", intense in the grain flavor, very hot milk, and a nice layer of foam to top it off! So I've been in a quest to find a place, THE PLACE. This quest has taken me from the most known coffee franchise in the world to the local ones, also to small trendy coffee shops and even to that infamous one that requires a membership. All of them have their signature and followers, but I never got what I wanted, until recently!  This European Deli offers all sorts of decadent delicatessens, great cheese selection and awesome panettones,  but its best feature is the coffee, at least in my humble opinion. The staff is friendly, helpful and well informed about the worldwide coffee variety that you can buy there to brew at home. They even sale stove-top expresso makers!  Now let's get back in track, this boys and girls are well thought on how to make a latte to perfection! The coffee used is The Royal, (and yes you can also buy it there to brew it at home too) every single shot is individually grinded, freshness like that I haven't found nowhere else, the milk is warmed up to your suggestion and the foam comes always like a cloud from heaven, a perfect cafe au lait! Or you can get yourself a capuchino and even an expresso to drink while shopping in the spot, you can seat outside or just to enjoy it as you window-shop The Main. Taxes are unclouded in the round price, no need for you to worry about counting pennies and dimes.  So you know, if you find yourself in the Plateau there is one spot for great coffee, La Vieille Europe.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome cheese selection, and a great place to go check out some interesting mustard or olive oil. As far as imported European goods go, it's hard to find anywhere better, or at least to find somewhere where it is all in one place.   I only wish it was open later in the evenings during the week."}
{"text":"The ground coffee is so good that I come here to stock up and take it back home to NY. They're always so friendly. The sandwiches are tasty, too."}
{"text":"On y trouve de tout venu d'Europe, des fromages, du chocolat, de la charcuterie etc, certe un peu cher mais ça vaut la peine! Pas ou peu de promotions c'est dommage!"}
{"text":"Épicerie fine et gourmande, qui importe en majeure partie ses produits de vous savez où, la Vieille Europe est définitivement un indispensable du boulevard Saint-Laurent venant totalement appuyer le multiculturalisme montréalais. La première expérience est assez convaincante. Dès votre arrivée, vous ferez face à un étalage fromager (plus de 300 sortes) aussi bien impressionnant pour sa variété (plusieurs au lait cru) que pour son prix. Côté charcuterie, vous ne serez pas déçus non plus, car tandis que le plafond pendouille généreusement viscères et boyaux bien astiqués, le comptoir comble la forte demande avec une devanture carnivore vachement complète.   Mais il n'y a pas que cela; au contraire, l'épicerie propose tout un pan d'aliments; qu'il s'agisse d'olives en vrac, de vins, de marinades, d'huiles, de vinaigrettes, de pains, d'épices en vrac, de thés, etc. vous survolerez l'Europe d'Ouest en Est, et prendrez au passage des produits de qualité. Les prix sont généralement raisonnables, mais il est à noter que certains cassots d'épices se vendent à une somme absolument dérisoire (moins de 1$). Il faut bien observer, car parfois, ce que l'on croit cher ne l'est pas du tout, et vice-versa. Le mystère des épiceries européennes...  Pour les gourmets, la Vieille Europe se démarque particulièrement avec ses cafés en grain, (plus de 40 variétés) torréfiés sur place. C'est, soit dit en passant, l'odeur qui triomphe parmi ce carrefour olfactif, car puisque l'épicerie est constamment remplie d'habitués, le torréfacteur ne chôme pas. Aussi, une gigantesque machine à espresso vous permet de déguster sur place (ou pour emporter) le délicieux café royal (torréfaction supérieure). Il est assez amusant de voir le personnel enfouir le café infusé dans un immense tiroir...  Un comptoir adjacent  prépare des sandwichs à la viande...  Incontournable de A à Z"}
{"text":"If you are visiting from somewhere else (Vancouver, like me) and you are always mad about outrageous cheese price wherever you live, you have come to a cheese heaven that is affordable. I am not sure why cheese is cheaper in Montreal and at this particular store but I love checking out so many different types of local cheese and also dry sausage selections. They have tons of goodies here you can gawk at for hours and I can always find something here to take back home as a gift."}
{"text":"Okay.  When it comes to cities with great culinary traditions, somewhere in the back there naturally lies a bunch of places to promote, vend and educate on cuisine.  Take New York for instance - if you want to know what we eat and how we came to eat them, you hit our bunch of ethnic markets and grab some finger foods.  Wanna know how the Greek do their stuff?  Hit Titan or  Parrot Foods.  Syrian?  Sahadi or Souk el Shater.  Chinese?  Flushing.  Korean?  Same.  Jewish style?  Barney Greengrass and Avenue J in Brooklyn.  In short, if you want something and is willing to travel the 5 boroughs and beyond, you'll be able to find it.    When it comes to Montreal?  You hit the Main.  The Main is basically Boulevard St. Laurent between Sherbrooke and Jean-Talon, and the diversity of places informs you of its richeness of flavors.  Want Hungarian and Askenazi jewish?  Start at the Sherbrooke end.  Portuguese?  That's around Rue Rachel.  Something more hipster friendly?  That's St. Viateurs.  How about Italian?  That's closer to Marche Jean Talon.  Interspersed between that range is a series of small shops that can cater to your specific needs.  Marguez?  There's a joint near that.  Spanish cooking with a specific need for a paella (the pan for cooking a paella is itself called a paella), there's a place that sells it.  A bit of a melange?  That's what La Vielle Europe is for.    So what makes La Vielle Europe such a good place to visit?  Well, it might have to do with its blend of European charm and core Frenchness.  When cultural anthropologists talk about food traditions they use the term foodways, which is the socioeconomic and cultural practices when it comes to food.  When Quebec was a New French Signoralty hundreds of years ago, its culinary roots were preindustrial French.  Then the Brits came in and injected its traditions, and throughout Montreal's history of expansion through immigration, new palates inform and expand upon these foodways, and there are still cultural and economic links back to France and other parts of Europe, and you see it in vivid display here.  First, the cheese.  The glorious cheese.  One thing every visitor to Quebec learn quickly is the richness of the soil at \"nos pays\".  They have great pasture, great dairy, and unlike the morons south of the border, they don't require their cheesemakers to pasteurize all their milk.  As any American can attest, Quebec cheese is just better, creamier and more complex, and there is no better place to buy cheese than here.  Have something in mind?  Point and ask!  They are not stingy with samples and will toss a few clues your way.  The price is fairly decent as well, check out their discount section for some good stuff.    Next, the baked goods.  Yeah, they have bread, but they also have galettes, pasteis and will do you a sandwich.  What kind of sandwich?  They can do something classical like a jambon sandwich, or they can make you one of those gorgeous Portuguese sandwiches with their large eggy rolls.    What about syrups and the beans?  Yeah, for the coffee geeks out there, they have a massive selection of roasts and varietals, and the same goes for the au chocolat.  Sure, they got coffee syrups to add that extra bit of salted caramel to your brew, but the payoff comes to your sodastream machine - The real charm comes from the availability of drinks syrups from France, the Teisseires and the Piquitos.  Trust me, it's much better than the crap on offer in the US, and they last a long time.   Honestly, with their large selection of sauces, candies, charcuterie and cooking oils, you cannot help but be impressed by both the breadth and depth of their selections.  Want good eating?  Visit old Europe.  No availability on Air Transat?  Bixi out to La Vielle Europe."}
{"text":"Oh dear-how to put this? It's a Foodie's dream. Not a Resto, but a Gourmet shoppe. The Cheese selection alone is enough to make one pass out. The Charcuterie, the same. There might be a  place somewhat like this in Chicago, but I'll bet not. Everywhere I looked, there was something I wanted, but couldn't buy, 'cos it wouldn't fly on the plane. In the end I bought an Opinel knife (remembering to put it in my luggage, 'cos I would have cried like a baby if I would have spaced, put it in my briefcase and had to surrender it to the TSA.) It's a shoppe, but they make sandwiches there from the good stuff in the display cases.  I ordered a Jamon et Brie on an exemplary baguette. Paired with a San Pellegrino Chinotto. Both were sublime. I and pal Beno took a seat on the chairs perched outside, and had a delightful repast with the Floor show provided by the denizens of Boul Saint-Laurent: Pretty Girls, Pretty Boys, Weirdos, Hipsters and Aliens. Oh-so-sophisticated and if I lived in Montreal, I'd be at this place every few days."}
{"text":"Etant moi-même européenne, je me suis dit que cette place serait LA place pour faire mon épicerie! Mais cela s'est avéré être le contraire. Oui, ceux qui aime le fromage y trouveront sûrement leur compte, mais à quel prix? Je n'ai rien trouvé d'extraordinaire. Si vous voulez trouver des produits européens, il y a bien d'autres places comme Gourmet Laurier, par exemple."}
{"text":"Super variété de produits fins et variés.  Comptoir de cafés en vrac, fromages de toutes sortes, comptoir de charcuteries, de saucissons, et tout plein de produits fins surprenants comme  des huiles d'olives de différents prix, qualités, saveurs. Répétez avec le vinaigre balsamique. Un comptoir complet de nougats et autres sucreries. Vraiment, c'est une vraie cave d'Ali Baba pour tous les amateurs de bonne bouffe et de produits fins. Une belle place pour trouver un cadeau d'hôte ! Aussi, ils ont un petit comptoir a sandwich pour emporter. Super bon :)   Attention au porte feuille, ça monte vite !"}
{"text":"Pas aussi cher que les rumeurs Montréalaises courent. Il y a moyen de trouver de la très bonne charcuterie et du bon fromage pour pas des prix raisonnables.  J'adore !"}
{"text":"This place smells like God's feet.  And I broke a vegetarian once, just by walking her through the door.  But their condiment, spice, and packaged goods selection is why they're my first stop whenever I'm looking for some esoteric old school European ingredient or food product that I've just read about in a book.  You want capers cured in salt made from the eyelid sweat of skinny little French ballerinas?  Over there, right next to the kippered squid teats from the Bernese oberland.  Bring a packsack."}
{"text":"Such a great place! I was looking for a nice gift basket, and the manager took the time to put something together for me according to my specifications. Wonderful! This is my go-to place for neat finds, a good sandwich at lunch, and a special treat now and then."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great cheese selections- A lot ! and Great Value, there are lots of special items - must be little old but perfectly edible and cheap.. 3 to 4 dollars, I've never seen that many selection in any store in CA.   Great Charcuterie selections - all kinds of sausages, ham, smoked meat, pâtés(rabbit, wild boar, duck..... yummy!) Great olive oil, vinegar, mustard, cookies, chocolates.. And COFFEE! They roast all the coffee in the store - hummm actually I need to find out if  but I saw someone roasting coffee in the store.....  This is my first review after I arrived in Montreal.  I found Yelp is not popular as in the Bay area so I decided to put some reviews as soon as possible.   I fell in love with this place at the first time.  so that tells a lot :) Yeah! Montreal!"}
{"text":"One of best places to get coffee I've ever been. One of the best places to get cheese I've ever been. One of the best places to get dessert I've ever been. Sensing a pattern? La Vieille Europe is a treasure; it is chock full of amazing and hard-to-find treats and you will have a hard time finding a better cup of joe (which is saying a lot for St-Laurent). I love this place, I miss this place, and I hope you'll try it out so you can love it, too."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. If I had found this spot when I first arrived into town and was buying goodies for the apartment I stayed in - a lot of $$ would have been spent. I wanted everything. So many condiments. Everything unique. Great housewares as well. Gourmet. European. The best.  A must stop for anyone that likes to experiment with food. LOVED!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here again recently to buy some delicious Quebec cheese. They have a great selection of cheeses from Quebec including some interesting unpastuerized chevres. They also have an excellent selection of jams and chocolates. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic store! I'll give it five stars on the sausages and the cheese alone. Not to mention the hundreds of other things that you just can't find in your typical supermarket."}
{"text":"Wandered into this place whilst exploring Boul Saint Laurent and to my surprise, I found mcvities biscuits!! Hobnobs and chocolate digestives, the perfect choccy biccys to have with a cuppa!!! Finally I do not need to fill up my suitcase with them every time I visit the UK. :) They also have a variety of other great delicacies from across Europe so definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"A really delicious option for meats and cheeses in the Plateau area, this is an old classic of the Main that really shines when it's meat-on-the-street street fest time. But all year round, if you are working or just walking through the area, you can count on La Vieille Europe for a super tasty and fresh sandwich and pastry to go from the counter. This is a chill family run spot so don't bring your stress in, just come and enjoy the savoury and sweet  tastes of the old country."}
{"text":"This the only place in Montreal where I can buy Marmite...wonderful assortment of European foodstuff...the people at the check-out could be  little bit more polite though, after all I am paying for the items, it is not a food bank."}
{"text":"Cette épicerie est une très bonne adresse pour les immigrants européens qui cherchent des produits de chez eux qui ne se trouvent pas ou difficilement au Canada. Mais aussi pour tous ceux qui cherchent des produits européens, ou encore qui veulent un grand choix de fromages, de charcuterie, d'huiles en tout genre, de vinaigres  et enfin de cafés. Moi j'y viens notamment pour leur tome de brebis et pour leur huile d'olives, dont la qualité est vraiment bonne. C'est d'ailleurs le cas de quasiment tous les produits vendus ici. Je dis quasiment parce qu'on trouve aussi des produits de type « Leader Price » qui est une marque allemande cheap, mais qui est vendue au même niveau de prix que le reste des produits. C'est une des choses qui m'agacent un peu mais d'un autre côté, la sélection globale est très bonne alors bon... Même si c'est un peu cher, on fait avec..."}
{"text":"German items are hard to come by in MTL but there's a few welcome sights for sad German eyes here amongst the largely French / Italian shelves. A nice spot that smells great due to the roasting coffee beans and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Long time Plateau resident. This is one of my favourite destinations. I go here for my coffee- either made by them or i get ground beans from their vast coffee bean selection. Otherwise they have excellent sandwiches, cold meat selection, chocolate, condiments and water from Europe-- ALL at reasonable prices! Have their croissant with ham and swiss along with a cappuccino for breakfast and you will instamtly regret ever deciding on Mcdo or Timmies."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. You can find everything and anything you need. The cheeses are not over priced and some of the best I have tasted. There's a huge assortment of oils and vinegars for all different tastes. I love walking into this place. I honestly have never bought coffee from here but it does definitely smell heavenly when you walk through the coffee section."}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit. Je l'ai découvert en prennant une longue marche sur St-Laurent. Moi, super habile avec les moyens de transport, je marchais du métro Laurier jusqu'à cet endroit pour me rendre compte, beacoup plus tard, qu'il y avait des métros très proche.  C'est à partir de ce moment que j'ai commencer à y aller régulièrement.  L'endroit est quand même petit mais tellement remplis. Il y a fromages, charcuteries, chocolats etc. presque tout que vous cherchez. Les employés sont gentil. L'endroit est propre. Ce que je fais en premier, qui est devenue un rituel, c'est que prendre n'importe quel fromage dans la section spécial. Alors, j'essaye pleins de fromages différents entre 1$ et 3$ la portion. La portion est parfaite pour déguster à 2 et même plus. La raison première et principale de mon retour à tous les fois et ce qui fait , pour moi, tout son sens. Ce sont les cornichons maison. Jamais de ma vie je n'ai goûté des cornichons aussi parfait...je suis vraiment sérieux. Ils se trouvent dans un gros contenant en avant du comptoir. J'en demande toujours à peu près 10-15. Ils se mangent rapidement chez moi, alors j'essaye de faire souvent le plein.  Oui j'adore les cornichons...et cet endroit ont les meilleurs."}
{"text":"I want to recommend you all the pri pri sandwich which they only offer on street sale event. This year the event is mural festival, 9-19 juin 2016.  You will find a long line for it. The sandwich is a grilled chicken thigh marinated with many spices. The sandwich also comes with sour cabbage in it. You can choose sauce such as pri pri, mayo, sweet mustard and Dijon. I really love it. You should try it my foodie friends."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal when I stumbled upon this little shop! The food they sell here is fresh, especially the cheese! We found the ingredients we needed for Italian pasta easily and they also have a variety of coffee beans.  This was my first experience at an European market and I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"La Vieille Europe has a fine and fairly wide selection of European import goods..  The highlight of the store - for me, at least - is their incredible cheese selection. The refrigerated shelves at the front of the store contain cheeses on special. Always check there first since there are always a number of things you can pick up to suit to your needs on sale.  There is also an array of prepackaged foods, though some can be understandably pricey since they are imported. Occasionally, certain items while be marked on sale - so check frequently to get cookies, candies, and other boxed goods for as much as half price. In the \"chocolate section\" near the register, they sell Callebaut chocolate for very reasonable prices.  I'm sure I'd like this place more if I had an unlimited budget to spend on food. I have purchased some of the items they sell here in Europe for obviously much lower prices.   I understand that they mark up due to import tariffs and the convenience of having hard to find items in one place, but wish some of the prices were slightly lower, knowing what the items cost otherwise."}
{"text":"A wonderful shop which specializes in hard-to-find products, European specialties, cheeses, cold-cuts, cured meats, sauces, coffees, teas and biscuits at very reasonable prices.  If you're craving proper British teas like \"Taylors of Harrogate\", German chocolates like \"Ritter Sport\"or \"Milka\" along with stand-by marinade sauces from Stonewall Kitchen, then show up here.  I'm always on the lookout for products I grew to love while living overseas but I find many of the specialty-food shops which specialize in European foodstuffs charge an ungodly amount when I thought the whole point to free-trade and liberalization laws was supposed to make this stuff cheaper, right? I guess not but I digress...  After comparing with other shops, La Vieille Europe has the best prices going. True, some of the items still remain insanely expensive but how many times are you going to go out of your way to buy marinated black truffles? On the other hand some of the German mustards which go beautifully with the fresh sausages on sale won't break the bank anytime soon.  Overall, a wonderful spot to pick up or try out new food items...and minus the tourists of Atwater and Jean Talon markets."}
{"text":"Truly a foodie's paradise! The first time I went in this store, I felt like my prayers were finally answered. Amazing selection of cheeses, charcuteries, pates, chocolates and my beloved saucisson sec! I spent almost an hour perusing through the stacked shelves, full of French/European products: You need to be careful as the bill can climb pretty high quite fast."}
{"text":"this place has loads of specialty items, gourmet selections, expensive cheese, deli meats, etc. it's a great place to stop to just rummage around, looking for a little snack -- or pick up a meal or stuff to make one. exceptionally quaint and staffed with patient people (yeah i'm talking to you, mr. deli meat guy). don't take it from me either; i'm just a tourist. i went here on a  recommendation by a local. ;-)"}
