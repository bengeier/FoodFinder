{"text":"Took a chance while trying to find a veggie Indian restaurant on the strip.  It started off well, the service was friendly but a tad inattentive as the night wore on.  The dinner buffet was tasty but the dessert selection left much to be desired.  Overall, a decent experience but not sure will be back again anytime soon."}

{"text":"Mmmm Mmmm. I love an Indian Buffet! Especially when it's only $12.99 for dinner! 
I was here the other day while perusing the shops in Little India. My tummy was grumbling and i was really craving a good buffet dinner. The restaurant looked nice and of course the price was appealing. When we sat down we noticed teh sign on the table reading $2.99 draft beer & $3.99 glass of wine with buffet. Bonus!! 
The buffet looked hot and fresh. I tried the butter chicken, curry goat, tandoori chicken, veggie pakoras and chick peas. They brought us fresh naan to our table. It was steamin' hot right out of the tandoori and delicious. My favorites were the pakoras and butter chicken, it had a nice heat and good flavour. I especially love dipping the pakoras in the butter chicken sauce. For dessert I had one of the cold honey balls (i forget the proper name for those little guys. Maybe Gulab Jamun?) and it was perfect to top up my already full tummy! The service was great, always filling up my water without me asking. I only wished i had tried a sweet lassi. Next time...
I definitely want to come back here soon!

p.s. free wifi for all you check-in-ers ;)"}
