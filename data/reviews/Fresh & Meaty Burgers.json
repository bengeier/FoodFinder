{"text":"This is a great place to get a good burger. The staff and owner are very polite and kind and service-oriented. There was a mix-up in the orders and my burger was delayed and they gave me a free slice of cake. And the apologize profusely. I got a royal burger and it was a monster it was so huge it looked like a bowling ball when it was wrapped up. These burgers are seriously meaty and thick. I also love the fries, I would prefer my fries to be cut a little thicker, but that is my preference. The fries are fresh cut and taste magnificent. The restaurant is clean and well lit and I will definitely be going back for more. Also my girlfriend lost a ring at the restaurant and they had it there waiting for her the next day."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed fresh and meaty burgers. The burgers are just as they say- \"fresh and meaty\" We came during a rush so we really got to see the staff work efficiently while we waited. We liked the girl working the front area. She was quick with our order and kept us updated during our wait. There are a few tables but it seems like more of a take out place. But, the tables they do have are kept very clean and the space is organized. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The is one of the best burgers I have ever tasted. This is a small burger shop with the best turkey burgers in Cleveland. The service is a little slow but this could be due to the timing of my purchase(a they were training a new employee). This could be a chill hang out spot soon"}
{"text":"SO Good!  I got the fresh and meaty meal for $7 huge portion of fries, burger was amazing. Will def. make this a regular place!"}
{"text":"We had been hearing a lot of good things about Fresh & Meaty recently so decided it was time to give it a try.  First, it is great to see something doing well on that corner of Cedar & Lee which over the past 10 years seemed to be just a bad location for a food business. Parking always seemed a deterrent to me but this is not actually a problem as there is off street parking behind the building off of Cedar.  I would give a 4 star rating if based purely on the food. I like 5 Guys and will still go there but these burgers are simply better. Thicker, juicer, & well seasoned. The big plus for my wife is that they have a turkey burger which she gave high marks to. The fries where also good but had a couple undercooked. Admittedly, I prefer thinner crispier fries so I am neutral on this. Finally, the value is fantastic. For a $0.50 up charge the special included the burger, fries, and a drink. Much better value than 5 Guys.  The thing that dropped the rating for me was the service and wait time. Yes, the burgers are made fresh to order but the 30 mins from order to getting food was excessive. I will say we were there on a Friday evening and they were busy (which, again, is fantastic for this location), but the process behind the counter just seems so disorganized with the counter help sort of tripping all over each other between call in orders, counter orders, and other tasks they also seem responsible for. Which brings me to my second knock on them. We watched one girl at the counter go directly from handling money, to putting a fries in the fry basket with bare hands and then back to the cash register. No hand washing, no gloves. Gross. At the moment I accept this as an unfortunate oversight on her part and not the accepted practice there because I did see others wearing and changing gloves.  We will return because, man, that was a good burger! But... We will probably call ahead to avoid wait."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely terrible. The manager knew her stuff and was on top of everything, but the cashier and the grill cook had no clue what they were doing. I went with a friend and ordered first. After the cashier rang me up he just walked away without taking my friend's order. We finally asked the manager and she was surprised the guy hadn't finished taking our order.  After we finally paid for our meals another customer walked in and ordered his food. 20 minutes later, that customer left - with all 3 bags of food he had ordered.  My food and my friend's food took another 5 minutes. Plus, the cashier gave us our drinks at the same time we finally got our food. That just made no sense to me, all he had to do was fill up some pop in a cup and hand it over. It shouldn't take 25 minutes to do that.  That being said, the food was pretty good. Despite the long wait for the \"fresh\" food, my fries were lukewarm at best, but they tasted good. My burger was good, and my friend ordered their Grandma turkey burger, which was absolutely incredible.  tl;dr horrendous service, good food."}
{"text":"Great burger, freshly made. Didn't have the large quantity production taste to it, taste like home made. I had the meaty burger special- burger, fries & drink for $7- great deal. Went at about 9pm on a Sunday evening and fries were hot. It was not as though they had been under a light for the last few hours. Service was excellent as well. Definite recommend"}
{"text":"Great, honest burger at a reasonable price.  Great people too.  Double-fry the fries and this would be as close to heaven as I will ever get."}
{"text":"Really good food there . It's so delicious and they are right about the burgers ,my main thing I would get is a meaty burger special it's affordable and good because if you went to five guys a whole meal (fry,burger ,and drink) would be like $11. And I feel like you get more for what you pay you know."}
{"text":"It's my second time and first time using UberEATS for Fresh and Meaty Burgers my first was ok not great burgers are fine not 5 guys worthy and no ice in sodas and eating in made me very worried....even with everything that went bad first time my step son wanted this for his 14th birthday so did UberEATS worst mistake ever the order delivered was incorrect when I called they said I needed to call UberEATS who credited the hamburgers but charged for the fries wtf"}
{"text":"This place deserves your business. Delicious burgers! I felt the service was fine and the place is clean. The only reason this place should have to shut down would be because they need more room for customers."}
{"text":"New favorite burger spot! (Bye bye Five Guys! ) For $7.50, I got a king (8oz) burger with bacon and cheese and was very satisfied. The meat was juicy and fresh and the bun was toasted perrrrfectly.  They forgot to include my fries, but quickly apologized and gave me and my friends free drinks and a piece of cake to make up for it. Super nice of them considering the fact that I only had to wait a couple more minutes for them. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The burgers and fries are both delicious. We recently had an order mix up and our food was missing. The cashier picked it up proactively before we even asked."}
{"text":"The name say it all: the burgers are fresh, cooked to order, and meaty. I like that you can choose from lots of different toppings for the burgers. I like that turkey burgers and veggie pastries are available. The fries are made from hand-cut fresh potatoes.  And if the peach cobbler is available, get it.  For those who are accustomed to instant gratification: please realize that anything cooked-to-order takes a few minutes. We usually call in our order and then drive over to pick it up."}
{"text":"Delicious! The look of the food reminded me of In-N-Out Burger in California. Fresh cut fries, came with light seasoning. The 6 oz cheeseburger was very satisfying, just as meaty as a double cheeseburger at In-N-Out. This ranks up there with 5 Guys, but nothing beats the Railroader Burger at the Fix Bistro. Excellent customer service too."}
{"text":"We were not impressed. Our order was just OK and it took a long time to come out. The place is very small and the manager was yelling at staff in front of us, pretty awkward. It was very cheap and we did get a lot of food for the money, but we won't be back. We came in based off of really good reviews on yelp so maybe we were just here on an off night, but we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"I got the grandma turkey burger. It's essentially turkey meatloaf in burger form and absolutely delicious. Seriously so good. While this place does have seating it's more of a takeout vibe so just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"I just realized that I haven't reviewed my favorite burger place in Cleveland, so it's time to fix that.  OK, so maybe not favorite burger, but definitely favorite value. The burger is quite good. Maybe not one of those fancy $12 burger joint burgers, but it packs a tasty punch and it quite large and juicy. Paired with fries and a drink for $7, and you can't beat it with a stick.  The fries went through a downturn for awhile last year but recently (as of winter 2017), they're back to being crunchier.   My go-to take-out burger joint.  Edit: the burger deal is now $8 (as of Spring 2018) but still well worth it."}
{"text":"Great burger, Great value, and good people- I got the Fresh and Meaty Special-  A Burger (6oz), fries (only one size), and a drink for $7...Yeah!  The burger reminds me of five guys but on the thicker side.  Mine was slightly pink on the inside- that didn't bother me.  I'm sure you could order it how you want.  The fries were fresh cut- mine were over salted, not a big deal.  I will definitely go back.  The owner, Gerald raved about the turkey burgers."}
{"text":"Was not happy at all my son ordered $40.00 worth of food they got the order wrong now they say they can't do anything about it because it was delivery so now he has nothing to eat and is out his money. He ordered veggie burgers they sent all beef burgers. Won't be going there anymore!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I went to Fresh and Meaty, and I was very happy with the food and service. The burgers are made fresh, not pre-seasoned, which was great (because I have some food allergies and asked to leave seasoning off). The employees were great, welcoming, polite, and the food was great. Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in and both got the King special cheeseburgers with bacon. Took a while but that's because these were 8oz. burgers. The price was great especially since it included homemade fries and a drink. Can't beat them, way better than Five Guys @9 bucks each! Only reason for the 4 stars was our fries were a bit under cooked even though we asked for very well done fries. But the fries were still very good. We're heading back to try the 3 and 6oz. burgers for sure and will ask that they try burning our fries. Another great thing about these burgers; they were not overly greasy which was great. They have very limited seating: high-tops w/swivel bar stools. I would have preferred that their fountain drink machine were a self-serve."}
{"text":"Amazing food and good service. The best burger in town. It makes me feel like eating homemade food made with love. They also treat all the customers very friendly!"}
{"text":"Fresh and Meaty Burgers came THRU for us on Super Bowl Sunday! We decided to stay in and order take out. This is the second time we've done this with FMB.  We love this joint that comes to us from (fun fact!) South Los Angeles. The owner we hear hails from Cleveland Heights though, so it all makes sense.  Fresh and Meaty indeed. They're known for their turkey burgers but their beef ones are great too. My husband usually gets the King beef special and I just go the Meaty special. Both come with fries and a soda.  You can kinda compare it to Five Guys but it is way BETTER!  We call ahead of time and the order is usually done in 12-15 min. Parking can be a challenge, but there's a place on Cedar just west of Lee next to the auto lot.   See photo for that yellow paper that tells you it's FMB!"}
{"text":"so so so good!!! the quality of the burgers here are great. It's a simple burger spot, nothing fancy as far as toppings...which is a plus in that you get more for your money as far as the quality of the patty goes, but a negative in that you're limited onto what you could actually add to your burger. The employees here are also really nice and welcoming. For the price you really can't beat it, $7 is unheard of for a good burger, fries & drink..even McDonalds *which I'll never eat a burger at in my life* isn't that cheap. Some people in the group I went with even ventured out to get the double patty option...and they almost fell over halfway through from being so stuffed. Lots of food and i'll definitely be back. SN: wish they stayed open later and were a little closer to case :/"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing, service is awesome. Everyone is really friendly and the food is cooked to perfection.  Parking is rough, but it is worth it.  If you can't walk a block for perfect burgers then you don't deserve them.  Fries are good too.  Great addition to the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Good burger, fries not so much. Fries appeared to be under cooked, actually they a texture similar to what you would get if you microwaved them."}
{"text":"Good burger!   I grabbed the meaty special, it came with fries, cheese and a drink.  The fries were fresh made to order.  Super crispy and hot.  One of the better burger places at a damn good price.  It took a little while to get my order, but I think that's because it was a bit busy.  You can easily call ahead to avoid the wait.  The burger was well done, which I'm fine with but if you're into a medium rare piece of meat you may be disappointed.  (Though I did not ask)  I'm excited to go back and try their tacos or breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"After Tricia & I decided on burgers for tonight's dinner, I consulted the yelp app for suggestions.  Being nicely greeted upon entering by Trina (one of the managers), began a nice in-store experience. Ordering was quick and easy, good explanation of the menu options and best value. Now for our review of the food.  We both got the 6oz burger special. It comes with a heaping order of fries! (That's a plus for me)  Everything was very good.  Our one critique is that both the fries and burgers were a bit too salty for our taste.  That's it!  We'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Food cooked fresh and to order. Absolutely worth the wait to get it hot and fresh. Ordered a king beef and my wife had the king beef combo + egg + hot relish and fries. Burger is excellent. Great flavor and, good portion size. Toppings fresh and flavorful. The hot relish is especially awesome. Only critique of this place is that the fries, although fresh, are very average to slightly below average. Additionally adding simple toppings such as hot relish etc is $1 each which is a little excessive and makes this place more expensive than it should be. Will return again. However next time will only order the burger. Forget the fries."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here on their 2nd day open (last night). The owner was behind the counter and was a very friendly/outgoing guy. He explained the menu to us in detail. This is the 2nd location he's opened so far.  The 1st is in Los Angeles. He talked up the fresh-made turkey burgers and seemed extremely proud of them....So I gave one a shot.  I decided to pig-out and got the KING 8oz Burger with everything on it, plus Bacon.  It was fantastic and juicy as promised.  The side of fries were also great.  Not too crispy, not too soft. A bit of potato skin still on them.  Salted just right. We got take-out, since we live 2 streets away.  As far as eat-in, there are only two high-top tables, and a wide/long counter.  I imagine they will add more seating as needed (it's not a very big place)."}
{"text":"Got a small cheeseburger with the works and an order of fries. It was delicious. Just the right amount of fat, fresh tasting beef and vegetables. The bun was top notch too. Will definitely head back here soon."}
{"text":"Located at the NW corner of Cedar and Lee Roads - traditionally a graveyard for any business that has set up shop there in previous years, Fresh & Meaty Burgers is a welcomed sight. Food that is fresh, simple, but tasty, and very reasonably priced is a recipe for having repeat customers who will come back time and time again - even having to brave the challenge of limited parking.  The name of the business says it all. The Fresh and Meaty special gives you a fresh and meaty burger with cheese and all the fixin's, plus fresh hand-cut fries (and they're very generous with the fries) and a drink... all for $7.00 out the door! WHAM, BAM, THANK YOU, MA'AM!!! The great thing, too, is that all the prices in their menu includes taxes!! Wow, genius! So the price you see is exactly what you have to pay! No digging for change!  You know what else??? You can place your order ahead of time on Yelp!!! How sweet! I mean, you can choose to dine in - they have like 3 or 4 small round tables, not a place to bring your family of 10, but the Yelp-order-ahead is a pretty sweet deal if you're in a hurry and wanna be in and out.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I work 4 doors away so I've been there 3 times already. Tonight I phoned in and picked up. I got a baby fresh for my 7 yr old son, a veggie 6oz for the mrs (who is very picky about her veggie burgers, she gave it 4.5 out of 5 \"considerably better than the Tommy's veggie burger\"), and a king (beef, with everything) add bacon add egg for myself. Fries all around and 2 sodas. Under 25$. Finally somebody who makes a really good burger that doesn't cost my whole paycheck."}
{"text":"Good burgers for a good price. Coupons are available with every menu. Recommend after a hard week at work."}
{"text":"I was actually pretty surprised at the burgers here. It's looks like an unassuming place from the outside. We ordered take-out cheeseburgers and fries. The burgers were good and had good flavor, and we had some custom orders (like no pickles, onions, etc) and they got our orders exactly right. Fries were good and crispy. It's some good food, especially for the price. Overall, I definitely wasn't disappointed! I wouldn't hesitate to come back here, but it's not necessarily my go-to."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and friendly staff. Food takes a little long to prepare. Don't be scared off from the strange green lights, it's a great place to pick-up from."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and fries. Really great prices and good service from ordering online. Must try if you're in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"WOW! I have heard so many great things about this place and finally had the chance to enjoy a burger myself!  I had the Meaty burger w cheese & the hubs had the King w cheese.  These burgers certainly did not disappoint!!! Seasoned well & By the crunch of the lettuce, it was clear that the toppings were fresh!  We used UberEATS to have it delivered as parking at Cedar & Lee can be tricky at times.  Both of us asked for no mustard but, I also asked for my relish & pickles on the side... While neither was on my burger... unfortunately, it was not in my bag either.  Otherwise- OUTSTANDING & WE WILL BE BACK FOR MORE FRESH N MEATY!!!"}
{"text":"The burger was a bit on the dry side but the toppings were fresh, crisp and tasty. The frys were cooked right. Moist inside and not cooked to death like so many places do. Overall it was okay but not something I'd go out of my way for. Getting the order placed was rather clumsy and is much faster and more efficient at 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Now I know the title of this place just may throw you off a bit...however, the food truly does live up to its title! The exterior itself is certainly eye catching with its green neon lights so you can't miss it on the corner.  On my visit, I ordered the beef double meaty burger with cheese meal. The order took about 10 minuets but I didn't mind due to the fact the burger was made fresh. The meat itself(you can choose from beef, turkey, or veggie) was very well seasoned and well proportioned. I'd say this place might have had the best burger I've had in Cleveland from a \"fast food\" spot hands down. The menu has many different sizes of burgers for whichever level of hunger you may be at.  The food burgers are very filling and are worth the wait. I'd recommend calling your order in ahead of time. This will be my go to burger stop in Cleveland moving forward."}
{"text":"The burger patties are thick and juicy! The sandwich I got (a double king burger) was MASSIVE and delicious. I also really liked the fries! They were crispy and fresh. We will be going back eventually."}
{"text":"Instant favorite with my friend group.  We came in as a group of 5 during a relatively relaxed time. Everyone ordered and we heard each burger being put on the grill - fresh. The food came out at a very reasonable speed.  Very friendly (and funny) staff! Made our wait enjoyable and easy.  There were a lot of options and their food was very delicious. Price was insanely cheap for how much food you get.  I recommend everyone to stop by this place and get some lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I have been here 3 times since finding out about this place. Burgers are great, we have had the beef and the Turkey. Fries are better than those other burger spots. Then u get the unbeatable price!! Hands down great burger, great deal."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for takeaway burgers. We easily placed our order online though had to wait about 40 minutes. The burgers were very tasty and full of your favorite toppings. With the burgers, the chili fries added too much beef; I would do one or the other. The chili was mostly just ground beef and was quite salty so next time I'll be opting for regular fries instead."}
{"text":"The burger was really good but the fries where cold and old. The service is absolutely horrible, the employees are rude for no reason at all. I'm big on service so I WILL NOT be back. Such a shame cause I really did like the burger."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the best homemade turkey burgers I have ever had. Reasonably priced and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great price and straight forward burger. We had the King Burger and Meaty Burgers, ordered for pick up. Overall, the burgers were pretty good for the price, and I ordered a lemonade which was a decent level of sweetness and freshness.  The fries unfortunately were extremely disappointing. They were soggy, over salted, and overall, lacking in any sort of texture and flavor.  Perhaps it is a limitation in the apps themselves, but the management leaves a lot to be desired to ease the ordering process online for customers. Many of their menu items on the store signs and on the websites do not have clear descriptions and directions.  Props to the ability to switch between different meats- this is certainly a unique offering that not many other locations may offer, and others will find appealing. (Clever, with the naming: \"Fresh\" and \"Meaty\")  Overall, nice to try, but other places with better fries exist."}
{"text":"Agree with most reviewers, they make a good burger. The price is good. The problem is consistency. The first one I got was pink on the inside  which was fine with me. The second was so overdone I threw it away. Had another today and it's also overdone but not so much I couldn't eat it..  I suggest you emphasize how well (or not) you want your burger cooked. They don't ask like at Five Guys."}
{"text":"Great burgers and sides.  Friendly staff and nice menu. Best to carry out."}
{"text":"We were delighted with the food and service at this gem of a restaurant.  We had the catfish platter and grandma's burger. The portions are huge and a great value. The catfish was simply a joy -- a cornmeal type coating, perfectly seasoned, and the fish so juicy and fresh I was literally sad to finish it. Hand cut fries were plentiful and perfect. The Grandma burger is reminiscent of meatloaf ala fresh hamburger. Huge and moist-- big enough to share but so tasty you want to be selfish. For dessert -- have the spectacular \"yum yum cake.\"  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Burgers were sooooo good. My daughter and I had the turkey burgers and my mom had a beef meaty burger. We all finished our meals. No complaints. Definitely plan on returning"}
{"text":"Got the Grandma burger special, loved it , so many toppings. I won't need to eat dinner after this."}
{"text":"Who would actually go to a place called Fresh & Meaty Burgers and actually expect anything more than the pink slime? I would now that I tried it. Not only are the burgers phenomenal, but these are the best fries I've had. Now I need to try more things on the menu. Did I mention the very friendly staff? Bottom line: Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a recommendation from yelp and was not disappointed. Fresh ingredients, Generous portions, friendly staff, very reasonable prices and soon to have homemade ice cream!  I would definitely recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm eating the burger right now. It's a fantastic burger. And Blackstreet is playing. So it's like sexy lunch time. The service is a little gruff, but they take input well and so if it's not all flowers all the time, well, you'll live. It's not called Kiss Your Ass Burger. It's Fresh and Meaty Burger, and that is what I'm eating. And since I like the way they work the 90s jams, it's also kind of freaky burger too. Seriously coming back.   Edit: The two best burgers in Cleveland Heights used to be at The Colony, which is gone, and the Curt Burger at Tommy's, and Tommy's has long outlived itself.   I declare this the new champion."}
{"text":"These are the best burgers I've had in a LONG tine. Great good, great staff. Quick service."}
{"text":"good burgers, a wide variety of stuff, excellent fries, and good prices. i will be stopping in whenever i'm at the cedar lee!"}
