{"text":"I visit this place whenever I crave for spicy chicken momos with gravy. I have not come across any other place in Toronto which offers momos as good as this place does.  I wish ambience could be a bit better but the staff is so friendly that you won't think twice before going there."}
{"text":"I love their simple yet subtle variations on Momo. Thalis are not only flavorful, it comes in good portion for a good lunch or dinner. I will be coming back to try their Thukpa  and Chocolate momo for dessert soon. Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Nice place, services are excellent, they are kindly and friendly, always with a bright smile..Food are tasty, beef momo are juicy and natural. mutton curry with rich is awesome, and the chickpea chilli with fried bread is a very valuable appetizer.....I will go with my friends next time, it's worth to recommend to friends and families.."}
{"text":"This used to be our favourite comfort food restaurant and ordered almost on a weekly basis. Our usual order was chicken thenthuk, steamed chicken momos, and chicken lollipop.  It seems that the management has recently changed, though, and all three of these dishes are now significantly worse. Not that they are bad, they're still good, but they were previously PHENOMENAL. Sorry, not all three: they no longer make chicken lollipop -- our absolute favourite! The fried momos seem to be just as good as before, however. But we no longer have a reason to visit, and will sadly probably start frequenting the closer Om instead.  We are very sad that our favourite dishes have been spoiled  :("}
{"text":"Great classic momo's - good dough and amazing achar/sauce. They also do variations such as chili momo, jhol/soup momo and fried. But can't beat the classic!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here, everytime I've come, I've introduced a new friend to this cuisine. My friends have loved what they've tried so far! The food is fresh and very tasteful. Lots of spices and flavours. I love their momo's! I've only had the vegetarian ones (regular, green and fried): all good! But my meat eating friend just recently tried the chilly chicken momo's and was raving about the perfection of flavours. Staff are friendly. It does get packed on weekend nights, so plan ahead. If you want to take out, give them at least a 15 minute warning."}
{"text":"The only place downtown to get a Thali and Choley Bhaturay!!!! I've only gotten delivery from here and I have to say it is so fast!! The food is so AUTHENTIC and delicious, that's being said as an Indian who doesn't like any of the Indian restaurants downtown. The chilli fries are amazing as well, super spicy though. Definitely my go to when I miss home."}
{"text":"They serve authentic food that enriches your soul. Nothing but pure love for this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The crispy chilli beef momos (dry) were unbelievably good. For those of you (like me) upset about not having a good Hakka style option in downtown TO: this place will satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"The \"Chips Chilli\" fries are fantastic so are the steamed buns. Friendly staff, I forgot my phone in the store and returned after an hour and they had put it aside for me."}
{"text":"Fresh food, nothing to rave about. I was disappointed in their menu item called \"Plain Lassi\", which does not indicate Sugar as an ingredient. Apparently, Plain = Sweet?"}
{"text":"This place has really good food! Lots of diversity on the menu, vegetarian friendly. The prices are very reasonable and you won't leave hungry. I love the momos! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! what an amazing meal we had! Try a bit pf everything you will not be disappointed, cant wait to go back and try more! The momos are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great food & very friendly service. The vegetarian momos and veggie thali were delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Momos, curries, chilli chicken, etc. are all fantastic.  Spicy dishes weren't super spicy. Not a complaint, just a note.  Service was a bit uncoordinated and slow, but worth it for the food."}
{"text":"This used to be the best place to get momo. We would come from Mississauga when we wanted good Tibetan food. Haven't been in a few months and came down and it moved to 1500 queen street.  Well what a disappointment. The beef momo are made differently. They have a think gross shell of Dough and the meat inside wasn't even cooked properly.   We also ordered shabtak. The girl on the phone asked if I meant chili beef. I said ok. Well it was like beef jerky with gravy on it.  Horrible and not like any other restaurant ever served it.  Such a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Best and most authentic Nepalese food in Toronto. Momo, Chicken chili, and Thali are my favorites. I wish this was in downtown so I could visit frequently."}
{"text":"I've had two soups from this place, both were delicious, as were the masala chai's, hot lemon drink and the momo's we ordered. The beef noodle soup is a massive steaming bowl of spaghetti noodles, ground beef and a few tasty tid bits thrown in for good measure. The mixed dumpling soup is a more simple soup with dumplings, greens and green onion. The momo's had quite a thick shell alas the flavour inside was delicious.   The service was friendly and the dinner rush hour a testament to how good this place is. I wouldn't say it's a quick eat but it definitely is worth it.   In true Parkdale fashion the pricing is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and reasonably priced. I got the Sha Bhaley, which was very filling for one person (or at least for me). My friend got one of the pasta soups, I can't remember which, but she didn't finish hers because it was too filling. My other friend got the chilli momos, which were delicious and spicy. For what you pay, it's definitely worth the price in the portion and flavour department. This is my first time having Himalayan food, so I have no frame of reference, but I enjoyed it. Service was good, the one waitress who worked there was very sweet.  Would go again.  My authority on Nepali food is limited as I have yet to try other Himalayan/ Nepali places, but I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. My fave would be the beef chowmein. It never disappoints and the hot sauce too but be careful, it is spicy. I love everything I order from this place because every dish tastes amazing. I have brought lots of different people here and never had a bad feedback. I always go back here whenever I crave for some beef chowmein. Service here is really friendly and wait time is not bad at all."}
{"text":"This place is so good it hurts. The food is insane but the place itself is kinda greasy/sticky/tiny bit dirty but maybe that adds to the flavor? who knows. All I know is that they know me by my name here and that's something i'm deeply proud of."}
{"text":"We went for dinner with a small group of 3 of us last evening, and we were blown away! We had ventured up and down The Ossington strip, then Queen Street, in search for a relatively cheap meal that would fill us up. And boy, oh boy, did we find exactly what we were looking for at Himalayan Kitchen.  The restaurant is small, but cute. The service was amazing! Our server was very helpful in our decision making process and offered us some great suggestions. We had ordered quite a lot of food since we were all feeling quite hungry, but our server even suggested that maybe we exclude one dish, since what we had ordered was a lot for 3 people. I'm glad she suggested not to get the last dish, because we were stuffed!  All of the dished we shared were packed with flavour. We were all raving about each dish.. literally not a complaint or criticism was made by any of us. We left full as could be... and then we walked up to bar to pay our bill. $40 for 3 people!!!  Himalayan Kitchen was everything we were looking for in a meal that evening, and we all concluded that we will be back again... and again.... and again..."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing here mainly for the food which is amazingly priced and delicious flavour :)it's a total gem ijnparkdale :) great bang for your buck, cheap and delicious what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"Pretty good Tibetan food with great prices.   You gotta love the spicy taste in food though.   Everything we had was terrific. Definitely will come back for more and to explore different dishes to share with you all.   If you'll ever in the Parkdale area, you should pay a visit to this place.   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. My wife and I stuffed our faces for $20. Green Veggie Momo was delish! Will be coming back, for sure."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone who loves dumplings or anyone looking to try something uniquely Tibetan. The momo's and the thali here was amazing. The flavors were unique, tasty and also great value. Food was tasty, fresh, and flavorful. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Himalayan food and boy was it a pleasant experience! I got their chili chicken in gravy and it was delicious. They let me know they didn't have any rice prepared and it was going to take a while to make, so instead they gave me this delicious doughy bread that kind of looks like pita...but it's like pita on crack! Awesome food. Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Nepal so I have had Nepali food and this is it. Momos are amazing anywhere but especially here, up there with the ones you get in Nepal itself. I also tried some of the other food, chili chicken, etc, which were good but very spicy, which I wasn't expecting. But honestly, it's the momos that are worth the trek (hahaha, see what I did there).   Namaste :)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Service is great and really friendly, and this place is frequented by a lot of Tibetans! Their momos are really awesome. I also really like the chole, and their thali dish. The noodle soup is also really good. We live in the neighbourhood and go here frequently. There are many Tibetan restaurants in the area, but this is by far my favourite. You should try it!"}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian Thali here! Really good value for what you're getting and the food is pretty tasty. :)"}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood of Parkdale and was looking for a place to have dinner. I decided to give this nondescript restaurant a go and it was not bad at all. I had the tasty chili chicken which came out fresh and piping hot with a side of rice.   Portions are quite large, prices are reasonable, service is a-ok, but the interior could use some updating, as it had an unattractive cafeteria vibe to it."}
{"text":"Like a lot of the other restaurants down here, I've walked past them and have never popped in.  Yesterday was hot, I didn't feel like cooking and wanted an afternoon snack.  I wandered up to Queen and passed Tsampa, where I have taken out before... I wanted to try another place I have always walked by but never tried.  Voila! Himalayan Cafe  It's a small restaurant, only about 5 tables.  Kitchen is in the back.   I didn't know the menu at all, although I have tried some Tibetan food in the past.  This resto has a really nice mix of Tibetan, Himalayan and Indian food on the menu.  I instantly recognized the Momo's, and ordered the vegetable ones, since I've never had vegetable ones before (here or otherwise).  They were steamed and came with this awesome sauce that packed a bit of a punch.  I know that Tibetan food is typically very spicy, so I was going easy on it.  It was light in colour, had a peanut undertone and was perfect for the momo's.  I have no idea how they spiced them, it was different and beautiful and warm and oooh so good.  I also ordered the chickpeas and roti.  The chickpeas came in a small styrofoam bowl, and the naan's were warm and in a brown paper bag.  Also accompanying it was a little piece of a lime pickle! I love those things! Did not expect to get it with this take out order.  The chickpeas were spiced perfectly. I could have eaten a vat of it. The naan wasn't oily but was warm and had a nice chew to it. Perfect for dipping into the chickpeas (Channa Masala).   The whole order came to $12, and I would absolutely order a bunch more things from the menu. It's small enough that I'll have this accomplished by the end of the summer :)  Stay tuned friends.. better yet - head there and see for yourself :)"}
{"text":"I'm rating it five stars even though it was a bit of a four star experience, the food was a solid five stars. The WiFi didn't work, and they were out of buckwheat flour. I ordered the butter tea, something I've wanted to try for a few years, and it was interesting. I expected more flavor. I also ordered the vegetable thali, and I would happily eat that every week!"}
{"text":"First time having Tibetan food and it was truly an amazing experience! We were in the Parkdale neighbourhood and it was amazing to see how many Tibetan restaurants there are around this area. There weren't a lot of seats, but it was always packed (people were always waiting in line for a seat) from the moment we arrived.   The Himalayan Kitchen offers free wifi when you walk in, and you will see a beautiful painting of Tibet plastered on the wall. The cups for water were Bronze metal cups - very authentic! I would say the wait time for food is slightly longer than most restaurants, but it was certainly worth the wait!   We got the Vegetable Momo (momo is the Tibetan word for dumplings), the chicken thali and the mango lassi.     The Vegetable Momo ($6.99).  There were a selection of momo's including options with meat, but we decided to try this vegetable style one. The momo's are dumplings - in comparison to Chinese dumplings, the skin is thicker than the Chinese dumpling, but thinner than those of a bun. The inside consisted of very thinly sliced vegetables with pepper as spice inside. The vegetable momo also included a curry dip for anyone who enjoys a more spicy taste - I thought that the momo without the dip was tasty enough!  The Chicken Thali ($9.99) Thali (according to google) is a word that indicates many small dishes in a large dish. In the chicken thali, there consisted of curry chicken in a small bowl, an assortment of sliced vegetables, potatoes, bean sauce/soup and a large scoop of rice smack in the centre of the dish! I thought this dish was rather spicy - but I'm not a very spicy eater.  Mango Lassi ($3.99) The Mango lassi was a great complimentary drink to have with the spicy dishes that are served in this restaurant. Lassi is a yogurt drink, so it definitely helped decrease the taste. There are no mango bits in this drink, it is very thoroughly blended, but I feel that lassi's are a must try drink in these local restaurants!  Really enjoyed this place - it opened me up to trying different Tibetan foods in the future!"}
{"text":"Since I started going down to Parkdale for Tibetan food, Himalayan Kitchen has been the place that I have visited the most. It is a smallish restaurant inside, and has not usually been too busy, so service is very personal. Generally I seem to wait about 15min for a meal, as I believe most food is made when ordered. This past Monday was the first time that an older gentleman (I presume the owner) was not serving, instead there were 2 young men who were kept quite busy by a large group and another impatient customer. The restaurant seemed brighter this time than before, I think it was because of the lights hanging over the serving counter, which also has a small bar behind it. There is not a lot of Himalayan décor around, but there is one large colourful painting of a countryside scene on the west wall and a picture of the Dalai Lama at the back.  For dinner, I chose the chicken thali, which is a mixed platter including dal and potatoes and a large portion of rice in the middle. Everything was very good, not too spicy as there is hot sauce available to add to taste. As always, I finished with a cup of Tibetan tea, made with butter and milk. I also ordered a serving of beef momos (steamed dumplings) to take to work for lunch the next day. The dumplings were medium texture and stuffed with ground beef; there is also a fried version that I have had elsewhere but not here as yet. Previously, I have enjoyed their gyuma, a spicy sausage served in slices, and the shabhaley, similar to beef patties but with a stiffer pastry. I still need to try the chili momos, which apparently come served in a spicy sauce.  My dinner alone cost only $13, plus $8 more for the momos, so an excellent deal. A lot of great food for little money. Needless to say, a strong recommendation, and I will definitely be back. As a final note, I have dropped in here just for a cup of butter tea a few times while in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN the best Nepali/Himalayan place in Toronto. I have tried literally all Himalayan places in the GTA area and this one easily stands out. Chilli momo and Mutton Thali are my two favorites from Himalayan Kitchen. As a Nepali, I'm usually disappointed with the quality of Nepali/Himalayan food in Toronto but can't say the same about Himalayan Kitchen. They are cheaper than other Tibet/Nepali places and have the best food. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Actually, I am craving momos while writing this review. Himalayan Kitchen, here I come. Ciao"}
{"text":"Food was really good but a few gripes: place is super cold. There are space heaters that didn't work... not awesome. And most of the restaurant just gets blasted by cold air when the door opens. Not ideal. The service was also pretty slow. The poor wait staff were hauling ass trying to get everything done so, not by lack of effort. But -- slow. Slow, slow. Food? Awesome. Like really awesome. And the prices were even more kickass. Alas, the reviews are for errythang. The whole resto experience and we've got to work on the temperature and service unless you're looking for takeout."}
{"text":"Himalayan Kitchen has phenomenal food! I ordered the thali, which came with chana, potato curry, daal and rice. I opted for Bhaturas over the rice, and they were delicious!!!  The dishes were so flavorful.  My boyfriend got the lollipop chicken and momos and he was quite satisfied. Next time I will definitely  try the momos. They have an extensive selection. The chowmein also looked mighty delicious.   I would have given 5 stars, however the wait is a bit much. However, it is definitely worth the wait. I will be visiting again soon.."}
{"text":"We have been here for more than couple times, usually it's not too busy. But for the last time it was super busy. I usually find the food takes a lot longer than expected. Momos are good and hot sauce is tasty too. Everything we order was vegetarian and no complain about the taste except for jhol momos. We were extremely disappointed with the taste. It seemed like it was cooked in yellow hot sauce they usually serve on side with other momos. Servers are nice but can be a little blunt sometime."}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave Himalayan/Nepalese food another chance. The very first time I had Himalayan food was in Cali and it was sooooo bland.  Nice, bright place with comfy booths and sweet, welcoming staff.   ORDERED: -Chili momos with beef - delicious beef dumplings in a delectable spicy sauce -Sha Bhaley - Tibetan beef patty was ok, didn't like the side sauce -Bhatura - similar to naan but more spongy with a satisfying chew to it. Loved sopping up all the sauce from the chili momos with this. DELISH! -Mango lassi (yogurt drink) - thick, not very cold and a little too sweet. Asked for ice and thinned it with a little water and it was perfect. I don't mind doctoring up my drink because I got more drink for the price I paid.  Reasonably priced, filling, delicious food; yeah, I will be back when I'm in the mood for more Nepalese food."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  I ordered the mutten curry and the steamed beef dumplings. The beef dumpling is very juicy and flavorful. The curry platter is quite tasty and it comes with a pea soup, veggies, potatoes, and pickled radish.   I can't wait to try the handmade noodles."}
{"text":"First time i've tried Himalayan food and its amazing! This is not a fancy restaurant but taste is 5 stars! Recommended!"}
{"text":"I will start with my sole complaint: the service is painfully slow and frustrating. As a frequent visitor to many hole in the wall type restaurants, I am quite patient with service but Himalayan Kitchen needs to hire another person in the front who actually knows the menu.  Get the momos - steamed. These are hands down the best things we tried. Try the Himalayan Kitchen special chow mein if you are a fan of the Singapore Rice Noodle (aka curry powder). The chilli potatoes were an addictive combo of slightly sweet, tangy and spicy.   The shabaley weren't my thing - there was a tiny bit of filling and a large amount of pastry. I rather have more momos.   They only accept cash or debit cards."}
{"text":"Ate the momos during the momo crawl.. Was the best of the lot so decided to eat at the restaurant and the mutton thali was equally good!!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.. This restaurant was the bomb dot com!! I loved all of their dishes! I even ordered some to take with me to Chicago! The place was nice except the big window was a little bit of a problem. The flies were coming inside.  The owner's son was so adorable. He came to us and started interacting. He gave us kisses on our cheeks before we left. We came here twice and third time was for to go. Will definitely come back if I visit during winter break. Already missing this place."}
{"text":"This is a family run Tibetan restaurant. The service is very friendly. We were seated and served with menus quickly. We ordered 4 dishes, laphing, chili fish, jho beef momos, and vegetarian noodle soup. The wait for the food is what lost stars. We waited almost 20 minutes before our appetizer was served. The we had to wait 10 minutes between each dish. It was veey frustrating. Food was good but too salty. Our bill for the 4 dishes came to $40."}
{"text":"If this is your first time, order the Jhol Momos.. If this is not your first time and you haven't had the Jhol Momos yet, you should be ashamed of yourself.. One of the most creative dishes I've ever had! Spicy, tangy, savoury brilliance... The special fried rice and the chilly chicken also did justice. Excellent service."}
{"text":"What a find.. absolutely recommend this place. We ordered the chicken lollipop which came with gravy and was fantastic. Then come the chilli chicken momo's with gravy again.. recommend it. Final order was veg fried rice which smelt so good but was full and had to take it to go. Will definitely come again to try other Nepali cuisine.. Food - 5 star Ambience - 3 star (after the food, can't complain but if they can improve it'll be even more busier) Service - 4 star (momo's are freshly made, so they take time about 15) Overall - 4 star"}
{"text":"My favorite place to satisfy my craving for some authentic Tibetan and Nepalese food. Always loved their food-momos, chowmein, thukpa,laphing, thali and list goes on and on. I have tried different dishes and NO REGRETS! One tip- make sure you check their special menu on the board!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably good, I actually doubted very hard how good this place can be but it was so delicious. This is the first time I've had Tibetan food and everything we ate was so good. The food is familiar but it feels like a fusion between Chinese and Indian. I'd highly recommend this place! Even though it sounds very different, I actually love this food!  We had the Vegetable Momo, Chicken Thali and the Mango Lassi. The Vegetable Momo is kind of like a vegetable pot sticker, but it's much fatter and filled with more stuff. The Vegetable Momo seemed freshly made and just steamed because when you bite into it, the colours of the vegetables are very vibrant, taste fresh and is super good. The Chicken Thali was really good too, it consists of several smaller dishes on a big metal plate that you can mix together in different ways and however you mix it together it produces something delicious.  The place was pretty busy when we arrived since they're a small restaurant so we had to wait a bit to get seated. But once we got seated, they were pretty fast in taking our order and bringing the food out.  The prices here are really affordable and cheap to, you get such good value out of the meals here!"}
{"text":"This place was the first place I went to a couple years ago to have my first bite of Nepali/Himalayan food, and my first impression - loved it! And there I began my Himalayan food adventures and started going to every Himalayan restaurant in and outside Parkdale area to try more food (Tibet kitchen, Norling, Om, Tsampa, Shangrila..etc). After the whole eating and trying adventure, I gotta say Himalayan Kitchen's got the best of all in terms of taste, freshness, and consistency! And now I come here almost every week for dinner, and probably have ate and tried 90% of their menu :D  Here are some of my favourites: Nepali Thali, chili momos, jhol momos, chicken chilli, dropa khatsa"}
{"text":"To be honest, I had never even heard of Tibetan or Nepalese food prior to visiting Himalayan Kitchen and as such, had no idea what to expect. It ended up being quite a pleasant dining experience!  ATMOSPHERE: It's a cozy atmosphere, but don't expect too much out of the decor. There's definitely tibetan/nepalese/himalayan decor pieces all around the restaurant, which felt like stepping into a new culture for the evening. I loved the silverware - they all had copper hardware! The drinking glasses seemed to be made of hammered copper as well.   SERVICE: We came on a friday at 6pm and the restaurant was about half full. Servers were really friendly and great at explaining the dishes to foreigners. As the night grew on, I found service to get a bit slow.   FOOD: For two people with small stomachs, we ordered quite a lot! We tried the steamed beef momos and the delhi masala chicken momos (they were the special of the day. I believe all the momos have the same filling/meat in them depending on which filling you choose, then they're either steamed or fried, and the sauce on top is really what makes them different. I preferred the steamed momo (steamed is better than fried), and the masala sauce was super spicy even though we asked for mild. We also tried the chicken thali which was delicious! I loved sampling all the foods around the platter but it's safe to say this is a filling meal on its own. Lastly, we ordered the thenthuk thukpa - it was more soup based and not too salty, and I really enjoyed the shape and texture of the hand pulled noodles.   Overall, I'd recommend trying tibetan food! Definitely going to come back one day but probably not order so much food. Two orders of momos is plenty!!!"}
{"text":"I really love spicy food and my friends brought me here to satisfy my craving for it. It is a small casual restaurant with indo-chinese dishes. Basically, it is the kind of cuisine you would get in north-eastern China.  We ordered Chana bhatura, chicken lollipop and chillies momos. There Chana bhatura was so so. The bhatura was undercooked. But the chicken lollipops and chillies momos were amazing. The chilli momos are the best thing to order if you like my kind of spicy, that is, very very very spicy :) I would definitely visit it back when I am in Toronto.  Also, price-wise the place is ok. The service is good enough."}
{"text":"One of the best Tibetan food in GTA. Don't miss their steamed chicken momo. I have ordered chilli pork and chicken fried rice. Portions are good and tastes delicious. Restaurant is clean and service is friendly. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I did my own Momo Crawl here with the SFT momo passport - went to four and this was not only their winner but mine too. Outstanding momos. It is Tibetan in shape and feel but it has a good amount of masala too. Juicy and plenty of flavor. Great texture - I don't know if I liked this chicken, veg, or beef better. Excellent - One of the best I've had in Jackson Heights, Toronto, or Nepal."}
{"text":"I'm in a serious dilemma now.  So basically I had to convince my family to be spontaneous and try a different Tibetan restaurant other than our beloved Shangrila. Queen st. West is filled with Nepali/Tibetan/Himalayan restaurants, all with very similar menu options. So I searched for a place that served thali's, since that's my new addiction from these cuisine's.  Himalayan Kitchen was definitely more busy than Shangrila but we luckily got the last table. We started off with one vegan momo, which consisted of tofu, and a vegetable momo. We also ordered a small corn soup to share, since it was freezing both outside and inside the restaurant. For mains I got the vegetarian thali, which comes with chickpea curry, we also ordered the mutton thali, vegetable chowmein noodles, and the honey chilli fries. We asked for the momo's and soup to be served first. For a small size soup, the serving was pretty huge and fed the whole table-very delicious. The momo's took pretty long to arrive compared to shangrila. They were served on a plate rather than a steam basket and was accompanied by a sauce that was not comparable to the amazing hot sauce from Shangrila. The momo's were okay, but again, not as good as Shangrila. One reason was because the dough was too thick imo.   My thali was AMAZING! The dhal was creamy and so flavourful, they added a tiny but of clarified butter into the rice, which gave the rice such good flavour, the potato curry and greens on the side were a large serving size, and the chickpea curry was also so creamy and delicious. My dad has an obsession with Shangrila's mutton curry, and he said that this mutton curry was as good. The noodles were great too. However, my brother wasn't that crazy about the fries. He thought they weren't spicy or anything special.   So the reason for my dilemma: Now, in order to satisfy my momo craving and my brother's spicy fries craving we'll have to go to Shangrila. Then to satisfy my thali craving we'll need to hit this place up. Good thing they're right next to each other...so I guess something can be arranged.   Overall, everything was truly delicious and service was great too. This review was just a comparison to the only other similar restaurant that I have tried. but without comparing it, i'd say that Himalayan Restaurant is a gem worth visiting.  Tip: try the mango flavoured Cheetah beer. So good!"}
{"text":"Ohh the Jhol Momos was to die for. Presentation and the general visual appeal usually takes precedence over actually lip smacking food these days. Go to Himalayan kitchen if you want to remind yourself why the best tasting food doesn't necessarily have to look 5 star worthy."}
{"text":"Food ***1/2 Service **** Ambiance *** (Out of 5)  I got takeout here. Specifically chicken thali and chilli beef.    The thali was great - very flavourful.  The potatoes that came with it was perfectly seasoned.  It tasted liked home cooking.    Chilli beef was ordered extra spicy and did not disappoint from a spicy factor.   Overall great value for the price and taste home cooked styled food."}
