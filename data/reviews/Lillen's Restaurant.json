{"text":"I don't eat at this restaurant very often. The food is okay but what is nasty about this restaurant is they let horrible smelling homeless people eat there. There is this one guy who comes into this restaurant & smells like he shits himself & he smells extremely horrible!  I'm glad I don't eat at this restaurant very often."}
{"text":"Oh hell yeah, for a restaurant on East Ohio street I think it's pretty damn good.    The fried chicken wings are delicious seasoned good and taste just like mama makes.  On my last visit we got fried chicken for take out.  The order was fairly big too.  I come from a family of six , we must have had 40 wings.  Lillen's handled the order well. I'm all smiles.  Don't be deterred the inside is little run down. Lillen's could use a face life, but hell the fryers still work and that's all that I'm concerned about."}
{"text":"ZERO......aggressive delivery people! Invasive and WILL trespass for $! The person who took my delivery phone order CREDIT CARD numbers.........never followed through with my submitted payment. The delivery drivers spent over an HOUR banging on my door! AND windows! And Honking, blaring their car horn!....FOR 45 minutes, at least! Frightening. Until I had to call 911. AWFUL! I've been a loyal (big tipper) customer for over 5 years. $5 buck tip on a $22 order is good? Fuck that..........Boooooo...... (They answer the phone \"Lillian's......it's Lillan's....)"}
{"text":"I tried the calzone tonight.  It was fantastic!  Italian sausage with peppers and onions.  What I liked most was that it was cooked perfectly.  Done the whole way through, but not overdone.  Glad I went."}
{"text":"I ordered fried chicken for my work holiday luncheon and it was delicious!!!! It was seasoned perfectly. I will definitely order from there again."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time    Not only did it take over 2 hours to deliver, they forgot food  ... nothing was hot .   50$ of a waste of money..."}
{"text":"Hidden. Gem. Stupid cheap. Stupid delicious. The wings are a thrill ride of fried goodness. The pizza is surprisingly delicious. The fried chicken is delectable. Any place that offers both chicken and beef gravy is home to me. The mashed potatoes suck, but that is all. Go here now."}
