{"text":"As an Uber eats driver that has stopped here to pick up food and delivered to customers, I started trying the pizza because it smelled so good, really good pizza, Sweet sauce not too greasy and if you're lucky enough you can catch some specialty pizzas like the things giving day pizza which is absolutely bomb, where the flaming hot cheetos pizza I tried today, Which I hope it permanently makes it to the menu LOL"}
{"text":"Good slice of pizza and usually quick, but service is questionable. If you don't mind just ordering a slice and a drink with the cashier having some attitude, this place is perfect. 

Chicken waffles was different and the taco slice was delicious."}
{"text":"Tried the General Tso slice. Great flavor and the dough had great texture. Love the added Semolina for crunch."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a slice of cheese pizza, a single slice - no fuss or frills. If the slice happens to be the size of my head who am I to complain?

I love this place because it satisfies your pizza craving while you wonder through Crocker Park without it being expensive or forcing you to buy an entire pizza. If you want to buy an entire pizza, that is an option and who am I to dissuade you.

They have several types to chose. Though if you just want a slice, not all of the choices are always available. That day I had a craving for cheese, simple and the the point. A friend got the pepperoni. We happened to come on a day where it was buy 2 slices of cheese for $5 or so, so of course I had to. 

Was this the best pizza I've ever had? No. But it was a decent slice. The sauce had a bit of sweetness to it, the cheese adequately covered the pizza and yes it was greasy. It hit the spot just right and the service was quick which is great because I could've eaten a bear at that point.

We were lucky enough to come on a sunny day that wasn't too cold because this little place is located at the center of Crocker so the seating is outdoors. You can try to walk and eat but the pizza is a thin crust and, as mentioned, the size of your head so that may be a bit difficult. But if you can manage that, kudos to you because you are more skilled than I am."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch if you are at Crocker Park or you can get it delivered with Uber Eats.  The slices are huge and they regularly have special pizzas."}
{"text":"Good pizza, generous portions and great price! I ordered 2 slices of cheese pizza for $5. The only complaint is the same guy who took my card in his hands, used his hand to help guide the pizza to the oven and also used this hand to play with his phone. Maybe a glove?"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and salads right in the heart of Crocker Park! Natural and locally-sourced ingredients always attract my attention. 

Hubby and I stopped here on our way back to Cincinnati - wish we had Mikey's at home. Love the concept of a walk up and being able to sit outside and enjoy the summer weather.  The slices are HUGE (try the 4 Brothers) and their salads a' plenty (love the pear vinaigrette) Very reasonable prices and delicious food!"}
