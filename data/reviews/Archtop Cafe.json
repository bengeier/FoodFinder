{"text":"This place is my neighborhood HAVEN.... Great coffee, and even tastier Vinyl records!!   The staff are also very welcoming and I hear that there's going to be an additional evening dinner menu added for the Autumn. Excited!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.. great selection of albums.. drop by for a coffee.. you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. However, I am diabetic and there is no Splenda or good quality sweetener. It would have been a 5 star otherwise. I hope the owner changes it."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. It is very small and very cozy:) We went there on Tuesday evening for a coffee and a small bite. Everything we ate was fantastic, coffee was fabulous! Service was outstanding! I love their establishment and I hope they have more traffic and more business, maybe they can build a patio at the back there their parking lot is :) With more small cocktail tables :) Anyways, we loved the place :)"}
{"text":"Had coffee the other day coffee was cold and watery after asking for a strong flavour the scone was good people are nice will visit again things happen no big deal. First  coffee of the day  is important for me."}
{"text":"Really nice place! Loved the food, I got a pre packaged salad. Super creative place with records downstairs available for purchase. Worker was very nice and helpful! Definitely coming back sometime soon. Would recommend to others!!"}
{"text":"A break from all the chain coffee shops. Not much seating but cozy with a nice vibe. Wi-Fi available."}
{"text":"I was always thinking for a cafe like this is exactly what port credit needs, and just like that it appeared. definitely enjoyed going here, the owner was super friendly and i love that the baked goods are all fresh and made with simple ingredients. they carry quite a large selection of vinyl at very reasonable prices with titles people actually want to buy not random stuff, going to be bringing my friends here for sure"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. Cozy little cafe with a great collection of vinyl, CDs and a few movies. Will definitely be back for a browse to accompany a caffeinated beverage."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that one of my favourite indie coffee shops from Mississauga had opened up a location in Bloor West Village. I'd walked/driven by a few times and today finally had an excuse to visit.   It's basically all the elements I thought were amazing from the Mississauga location with improvements in all the areas I wished the other had. Those improvements being: more seating, more space, more food options (and more to come as this location will soon be a sit down restaurant and not just a cafe), more vinyl, better wifi and a few electrical outlets to plug into if you're planning to do some remote work like I was today.   I spent the better part of the day here enjoying their awesome music selection, a green tea, a fantastic bowl of thai chicken soup and pretty darn good Turkey and Brie cheese sandwich.   The sandwich had a great aioli on it that I couldn't quite place and had been cooked in a panini press. My only issue with it was that they cooked the sandwich with the lettuce inside so it took on a bitter taste and mushy texture - lettuce should be added after as a topping as it requires (and does better with) no heating.   Other than the hot lettuce lol, everything here was great. I didn't have a chance to peruse the used vinyl in depth as I was busy but the selection was epic. I could honestly get lost in here all day.   They're still putting some finishing decor touches up and the liquor license application is in the window. Between drinks and the live music I've heard they have here, I can't wait to come back next!"}
{"text":"Nice small coffee shop! I liked the location and street parking availability. Their ice cream espresso is a really nice thing to try.  Staff is welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Phew! I can finally remove this from my bookmark list - it's been there for month now. Tired of the Starbucks run-a-round and burnt coffee scene I planned for my meeting in Port Credit to take place at its newest indie coffee shop SLASH record store - Archtop.   In Chicago they call a place like this a \"slashie\" - part one type of business slash part of another. I really enjoy this combo as someone who never wants to order just one thing when I eat out. Now I can double my business pleasure by visiting two kinds of business in one!  Free wifi to begin with so that's a huge start off the bat. For those looking the password is their phone number, no dashes or spaces.   The record store part is both upstairs and in the basement. The new/current records are upstairs, along with various CDs and DVDs and box sets of all of the above. In the basement lives their growing previously loved record collection also for sale. If you've got the time and the patience you can find some gems at a very reasonable price. For ex: saw MJs Thriller for $29.99 - in great condition.   To add to the audiophile experience they also have an audio expert on staff who can assist with all you record and player questions.   With regards to the cafe portion, it gets full marks as well. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and it was fresh made today just on display in their refrigerated display case along with tons of other sandwiches and sweets (made and packaged by local GTA purveyor Sweets Of The Earth). To go with my breakfast sandwich I went with a Chai latte. The latte came in a temperature controlled double layer pint glass of sorts and the chai, while not a spicy chai was mellow and tasty and the perfect temperature for my taste.   My only critique is that the space is so small and there are no plugs of you've got a laptop - but I get it with the small number of tables they want to keep customers moving, totally cool. It won't keep me away.   In my books this record store SLASH cafe is awesome SLASH hip! I'm in!"}
{"text":"Strolled into this cozy place late tonight. Delightfully surprised at the selection of comforting eats and wide selection of hot drinks. While the turkey brie sandwich I bought was one of the day's last, it was definitely much better than your average coffee chain's offerings. Brownie was as good as they ought to be despite not being made in house.  Did not need another coffee this late at night, but the friendly staff gave me enough great recommendations for next time.  Classic tunes and vinyl make Archtop cafe a wonderful standout with an ambience that really isn't matched anywhere else in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Unique offerings and incredible staff. The coffee is for a true lover of the beverage, ranging in roasts and flavour profiles. I haven't tried the snacks here -- they didn't seem very appealing to my palette -- but many patrons were enjoying baked goods."}
{"text":"They served us rotten soup ( their moroccon soup on menu) with rotten celery and potatoes which was sour as if it was a month old. The servers said the soup was from a frozen bag that they defrost and the owner thinks that the chef may have mixed old soup with new.  In either way never going back there. When heard my complaint, they were more concerned about the reviews although they offered a coupon for future vs returning my money which is inappropriate. This ruined my lunch with my daughter today :("}
{"text":"A group I belong who meet monthly have met here a few times; the owner is very nice and has been accommodating to us. It's a nice spot. However, I have had two meals here and both were unsatisfactory. The most recent was a grilled cheese sandwich and how that could be messed up I don't know; it was almost cold and hardly grilled. I will not be eating here again. Such a shame because it IS a nice spot."}
{"text":"Love this quaint little place!  It's a small narrow store, as you enter, you'll found boxes of LPs and shelves of CDs, DVDs on your left, and to the right a case filled with tempting cakes, sandwiches and pastries.  I believe they have more CDs downstairs or somewhere though we didn't get to explore.   Service is sweet, coffee is seriously good, and the food so delicious we were picking up crumbs from the plates!  The chocolate tart is wonderful, get it if you see it!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop! We had a mocha, a pumpkin latte and chocolate chip cookies, and we were very happy with our orders. Love the chocolate chip cookies"}
{"text":"Apparently this place is owned by the caf√© of the same name in Bolton.  While this place is a lot smaller, they still maintain the same theme of vintage music (they have vinyl!).  I had their roobis tea latte and it was nice and smooth.    In terms of atmosphere, it's a nice mood, but there are only two tables and a little sitting bar area.    Verdict: While your in Port Credit, drop by this place for a latte, coffee or tea to enjoy it while you enjoy the scenery by the lake."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday morning and was immediately greeted with sweet, friendly service and a smile (always a good way to start off your weekend!). Various pastries were available for sale by the counter. Drinks menu had good variety (they had your standard espresso based drinks, plus various tea lattes available), listed on a board behind the cashier. Seating is very limited (a couple of tables and some counter space) so not ideal for bigger groups who want to sit in and enjoy a drink.   If you walk down the stairs located at the back of the cafe, it leads you to boxes of records for sale to browse through downstairs. Very funky, unique shop that you should certainly check out if you're in the area. It's unconventional, and a welcome addition to an area serviced by mostly chain coffee shops.  In terms of its actual products, this ended up being pretty average to us. We ordered a) a hot chocolate and, b) a latte - both were just okay. I actually found my latte to be a bit burnt-tasting. Couldn't really appreciate the taste of the beans - I ended up dumping a whack of sugar in it to really enjoy it. The hot chocolate was also just okay. So as of our first visit, environment exceeded product quality. Perhaps we visited on an off day.   Overall, and despite this, I really enjoyed the environment. It's very casual and I love the community, small-town vibe it brings to the heart of Port Credit, so I'll definitely be back to try out something else on their drinks menu."}
{"text":"This place is adorable little caf√© in a great neighbourhood. As a first timer to any new place, I always ask for a suggestion or recommendation on what the menu is known for I believe the owner recommended me the eggs on toast. Eggs on Toast. It's a little too basic for it to be the most expensive menu item. Presentation was average, I found the eggs a little overcooked for my liking, also a little bland. It just seemed like something I could make it home. Also it only. Came with 2 eggs but only one slice of toast. I'm confused Why??   Honestly adorable cafe with really great service and interaction points but needs to work on the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Despite the very quick and very late night visit I thus far see no reason for anything less than a 5 star. I did my usual latte test, simply asked for a small latte. They had raw sugar and cinnamon you can top with after. The latte was very smooth! I think that a lot of people would agree that it's very good, as most Canadians (from my experience) tend to shy away from anything too strong (hence the popularity of Tim Hortons). Now I like my coffee extremely bold but I totally appreciated this drink.  I got a buttertart to-go; to eat today after my run. I heated it up in the oven and oh my goodness!! The crust was amazing and the inside to die for. I am so impressed. They do not make them in house but they are made fresh daily for them.  The decor is very cute. Music theme as you can deduct from the photos. And it is just so refreshing to have an independent coffee shop back in Port Credit after the loss of The Guilty Dog (still bitter about that). The prices are totally reasonable 2.99 for the latte and small was actually pretty big. Second Cup is right next door but I would come here over a chain any day."}
{"text":"Came just to try the espresso and ice cream and it was worth it!  Don't think a lot of people know there is ice cream in this place but damn was it good!"}
{"text":"Finally a coffee shop that knows the art of making a great cup of coffee as well as creating an enjoyable ambience.  While I haven't tried the food yet, lots of patrons have and it looks fabulous!"}
{"text":"My new neighborhood staple. I love the vibe and the service. Croissants are amazing and lattes are good too."}
{"text":"Great little coffee/vinyl shop.   I went only for coffee/breakfast which is what most were doing at 8 am.    The store is only about 12 ft wide but chocked full of interest and fun.   One side is coffee the other with bins of LP vinyl albums from the 60's, 70's and 80's.  Lots of vintage album art to enjoy while waiting for your food order.  Also sell make your own Guitar kits and high end turntables.  Downstairs are more Vinyl, CDS and DVDs.    I had the Turkey Brie greens aioli on cranberry baguette (heated) which was very tasty along with chai latte.   Sit at one of the window bar stools facing the street and watch the world in action."}
{"text":"Spending the day in Port Credit - I was walking around with my fiance looking for a coffee shop to grab a drink. I walked by Archtop Cafe once and stopped to look inside and saw all the records - I was sold! We walked in and instantly loved the atmosphere.  This place is like a two in one deal - the record store part and the cafe/coffee shop part! Really great business idea. I may not have a record player but I loved looking through the records and seeing all the different types of music that were available. There is something nostalgic about records, and even the decor of the cafe was a little nostalgic. They also have more records and CDs in the basement so don't miss out!   In terms of the cafe/coffee shop part, I ordered a Chai Latte, my fiance ordered a large Iced Caramel Latte and we also ordered a cheddar scone to share. First of all the scone was so buttery, flakey and fresh, it was crumbling apart! I'm somewhat of a scone snob and really picky about my scones and this one passed the test - I kind of wish I didn't share it actually. My Chai Latte was smooth and flavourful, and my fiance said his Iced Latte was just the right amount of sweetness.   The ladies working that day were really helpful when we asked about other cool places to check out in Port Credit (we are from Hamilton so we had no idea where to check out for lunch, or other cool stores). There are only a few tables and stools to sit in, so it's pretty small in there, but I like small cafes!   I'll definitely be back when I visit Port Credit again. I would love to try some of the freshly made sandwich's and snacks!"}
{"text":"This place is really great. I like to support local business so I sometimes go in here while I wait for my daughter in her karate class across the street.  The staff is lovely. Very pleasant and I have noticed there are regulars who come in and they know their names.  I order tea and watch the traffic go by at the big front window while I listen to great music. The oatmeal raisin cookie is delicious, as is the pumpkin muffin. I have not had any of their sandwiches but they smell great and they offer a gluten free option.  The atmosphere is cool. I intend to buy a record player so I can buy records in here. :) I understand from another review that there is a lower level. I can't comment on the selection but the records that they have on display upstairs are awesome."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and really enjoyed the coffee and breakfast items, but this evening I discovered the soft-serve ice cream. Now, soft-serve is generally not something people rave about, but this was delicious. (And made with real ingredients - not a bunch of fillers!)  And the kicker is that it is safe for my peanut-allergic daughter, which is often very hard to find. To know that there is a place in the neighbourhood we can walk to for ice cream is awesome.   The service here is also very warm and inviting and never rushed."}
{"text":"Delicious & reasonable drinks - I recommend the chai latte."}
{"text":"Love the tea lattes here! One of my favourite stops when in Port Credit. The roobios tea latte and London fog are a must for any tea lover. They don't over steep their tea, so there is no sense of bitterness. They also don't put an over abundance of sugar in it in comparison to other franchised cafes.   I've enjoyed my cranberry baguette there (lightly toasted with butter) and their breakfast cookie. Their breakfast cookie is like a chocolate chip cookie on (healthy) beast mode, complete with pumpkin seeds and flax seeds to give it a chewy texture. It's super filling with all of the loaded fibre and protein.   Any music and movie lover will love perusing through the old music and movies. Their used selection contains popular titles for dirt cheap. I plan on passing by in the near future to pick up $3.00 boxed DVD seasons and $1.00 movies. :)  The atmosphere is warm and cozy with some little vinyls and record players on display. The staff is too - although I did pass by right at closing once and wasn't too warmly treated beyond the door. I don't blame them though. Stragglers!"}
{"text":"FINALLY someone read my mind and opened up an indie caf√© in Port Credit!  I mean there's nothing wrong with Starbucks/Second Cup, but another non-chain option would be nice and now, there is one, Archtop Caf√©!  Archtop Caf√© is actually a transplant from Bolton and that location was HUGE in comparison.  It was a caf√©/musical instrument store/live music space, so you can imagine the size of the space.  Anyway, this may not be an entirely fair review because I didn't have the coffee!  It was later on in the afternoon and I had already had a giant cup of Joe in the AM, so I opted for a Matcha Tea Latt√©.  Pretty good, Matcha could've been stronger, and next time, I'll ask for less ice chips!  ;)  I'd prefer more drink as opposed to ice for $5.  Seating is quite limited at this location.  Only a coupla bars with a few stools and that's it!  Not really meant for dining in &/or studying/doing work on your lappie.  I'll definitely be back to try their coffee and possibly food items, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"They made a great iced coffee, friendly staff. The meals looked yummy! I enjoyed checking the records out. I will definitely be back here often!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop. Nice to have a unique alternative to the big chains. I've enjoyed the coffees and they have nice loose leaf teas as well."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! That's all I have to say about this place.  Well actually, I have more to say than that. We were looking for somewhere other than Starbucks or Tim's to go for an iced coffee-type drink the other day and I found this place through Yelp (where else would I look?!). The pics. of the espresso with soft serve ice cream just drew me right in and I knew I had to give it a try.  I ordered the soft serve espresso and my husband ordered a dark roast coffee and a cheese scone.  The scone was fresh, buttery and had a nice amount of cheese in it. The only (very small) complaint was that when I asked if he could have butter, they put the absolute tiniest scraping of butter, like less than a teaspoonful on it. Other than that, it was just delicious. He said his dark roast coffee was also very good.  The espresso with soft serve was soooooo delicious! At first spoonful, it seems like it's all ice cream and you kind of wonder where the espresso is, but then you find it and it's oh so good! In fact it's so good that we've already been back to have it again and this time my husband and son also ordered it. My son also had the gluten-free brownie and he loved it!  I love that they have free wi-fi, although the place is pretty small so you might have a hard time finding a table to sit at with your laptop. Another plus is that they have some tables outside, which is lovely during this sunny, warm September.   If you're into records/cds/dvds they have a pretty decent selection both in the caf√© and downstairs in the basement.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here specifically for \"The Duo\" which consists of espresso and ice cream! It is delicious and would definitely come back again for more! Only reason I gave it a four star is because of the price. $4.99 plus tax is quite pricey but all in all, it is yummy! Great summer coffee alternative."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Bloor west. The staff are really friendly and knowledgable. They have MANy gluten free options (sandwiches and baked goods) and the coffee is amazing. I ordered the all day breakfast and it did not disappoint, they also have records for sale and live music on the weekends. Try the cashew cookies! I've never had a better cookie in my life.... they definitely have a new customer for life!"}
{"text":"Very friendly Barista, the Mocha was on point as it was not too sweet but still rich, just the way I like it. Did not sit inside but would come back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. Decor is nice, place is small but there are a few spots to sit inside and a couple of chairs and tables just outside. I liked the music motif and the old school records for purchase, good taste in tunes. I got a Mocha and a butter tart and my fiancee had a Cappuccino. Tart was delicious and the mocha was good but I actually enjoyed the sip of my fiancees cappuccino more. Don't know how often we will go back , but would recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"So my parents (fellow yelpers and elite) told me about this place during the summer. I finally went and well, it was no surprise that everyone recommended it.  It's right off of lakeshore and is a tiny little shop with pretty limited seating indoors, but there's a patio that makes up for it. It's also a record shop, but I haven't explored the basement.  Now to the good stuff, I've only had the one menu item, but it's so good that why would I ever want anything else?! So I got the espresso with twist soft serve (chocolate vanilla) in a cup.  It is amazing. The espresso is like a medium roasted blend and it's amazing. The ice cream has a really nice icy quality to it, it's smooth, but slightly icy in a good way. We now consider this to be the best ice cream place for soft serve in Mississauga/Oakville.  It's just the perfect combination of ice cream and coffee and it is a MUST if you're in the area. Plus they're open late. The staff are super nice too. Animal friendly as well. And gluten free and nut free food as well. If you're not already heading there while reading this review, then you're crazy. So. Go."}
{"text":"Love this little spot!  Fabulous lattes, sandwiches are always fresh, tasty, with quality ingredients.  The lemon meringue tart (if you're lucky to come in on the right day) is the best you'll ever have, and if you're a  scone lover keep an eye out for the cheddar & chive.  In the past year I've become re-acquainted with vinyl, and Archtop has a great selection of new and used LP's.     A great little spot, very personable owner and staff, parking right in front, and a real warmth to the place.   What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Randomly ended up in here when I was walking by with my cousin and she wanted a bottle of water. The owner was very sweet and we had a nice discussion about all the vegan/vegetarian options as I'm a vegetarian who is lactose intolerant. She was very friendly. I was curious to know what a \"dirty chai latte\" is (chai latte with a shot of espresso) and decided to share one with my cousin. It was so delicious that we ended up going back after half an hour for another one. I recommend getting it with soy or almond milk, tastes excellent."}
