{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience of my life. Waited over 40 minutes for my food. Watched four people who ordered AFTER me get their food first. Was told \"sorry dont know why yours is taking so long\" Well its taking so long because you keep doing other orders before mine.  Finally got food and fries were soggy, burger was horrible. If you like punishment i recommend this place. Otherwise next time you are at the \"footd truck\" friday AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST."}
{"text":"Grabbed the $10 burger deal with fries and a drink. For drinks, all they had was diet Pepsi, water, and Monster (saw this after I paid). The lettuce was from a salad package so I had to sift through the carrots, onions, and cabbage to put lettuce on my cheeseburger. The curly fries were ok. Nothing special. The burger was drenched in seasoning and was not edible. After the first bite, it went in the trash. Waste of $10."}
{"text":"Colossally slow service at the Biergarten outside of Crescent Ballroom recently.  Waited for 15 minutes (in a line with maybe five people ahead...) to have my order taken, only to be told that they were out of veggie burgers and sweet potato fries. I ordered some regular fries instead, and waited 20 minutes for those.  Owners: put up a post-it note on the menu if you run out of something.  You should also serve fewer options - the slowest part of your operation is your cooks being confused on what they were making for literally every order I watched you take for the ~40 minutes I stood there."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Their calendar showed they were supposed to be at Queen Creek Middle school and they sent a roach coach instead.The fryer was broke and they only served quesdillas and burgers. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Now, that's Amore! This one of my favorite food trucks. The Bacon Bison Cheddar Burger is delish and the guy taking orders is really friendly and a lot of fun. I'll be back to visit them again next Food Truck Friday."}
{"text":"I had a bacon cheddar burger with sweet potato fries.  Great burger!  The bacon was cooked just right.  The sweet potato fries were perfect. I'll be watching for this truck at future events."}
{"text":"As a worker on other food trucks, I am truly a food enthusiast. I had the luxury of having the Bacon Cheddar and the Turkey Shroom w/ fries. The Bacon Cheeseburger was AMAZING!!!! The flavors were great, my burger was cooked to perfection and the bun, had a notable taste. The Turkey Shroom was also REALLY good and well worth trying. Oh and the fries, so good!!!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely blown away with the burgers at Burgers Amore.  I saw on the news that it was National Cheeseburger Day the other day and they were interviewing someone from this place and their menu looked very interested so I figured, heck why not try them out.  I didn't realize they were doing an event close to one of my appointments that day and so I stopped in.    I decided to go with the Double Burger and added Bacon and mushroom (gotta have bacon)!  I wasn't expecting much from a food truck but this is by FAR the best tasting burger I've ever had!  I would HIGHLY recommend anyone to go out any of their events and get a burger!"}
{"text":"This has probably been my favorite food truck experience in Phoenix yet.  This is a burger truck, so don't go here unless you want a burger, but they have a variety of burgers to please all but the pickiest of eaters.  Start with a basic cheese burger with american cheese, or go for a chicken burger if eating cows isn't your thing.  They also have bison burgers, and a wide variety of pre-configured toppings, or create-your-own!  I had a California Avocado Burger (check out the picture I uploaded) which was a very respectable burger.  It was cooked medium-well, with thick slices of avocado and bacon on top, a nice spring mix, and no onion (you have to keep your breath fresh for those after-food-truck-lunch rendezvous).  I can't comment on the fries, but the burger was filling, fresh, and delicious.  The guy running the truck was also friendly and efficient, which I appreciate!"}
{"text":"Highly dissappinted . I have experienced hamburgers from food trucks before . And have always encountered fresh ground meat. This truck only sells frozen meat...(Yuck) I don't mind paying ,but I like paying for quality.I would not eat here again. And  there customer service 0 stars ."}
{"text":"Basically my whole experience with this food truck started at Race Wars in Gila Bend and I have to say I was more than disappointed. I payed a ridiculous amount for a bland burger, the man working the \"register\" (which was actually just a wad of bills he was holding in his hand) was completely incompetent and couldn't even do his job. I stood in line for literally an hour and had nothing but a bad time. This food car is terrible and I can't ever see anyone having anything but a disgusting experience with it."}
{"text":"This is a good FOOD TRUCK, and, and they bust their ass to make it good and help their customers! Good Food, Good Service.....Good Job Guys, Keep up the good Work!"}
{"text":"Dee-li-shus! I love this food truck. I try to stop by every time I can at food truck friday, and I will definitely buy yummy burgers from them any time I see them elsewhere too!"}
{"text":"Their food truck swung by our office so I grabbed a Grilled Chicken burger. Tasted nice but that was mostly it. The chicken was dry but not crazy dry. Kind of like you left it out for a bit too long as you were cooking other things kind of dry? It wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either. It was an average sized burger for $6 so I'm not complaining too much. They're also one of the few food trucks with sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Truck got here on time. Food is awesome! Had the fish n chips! And their service was awesome! No complaints."}
{"text":"I tried the veggie burger with sweet potato fries. I opted for a regular roll instead of whole grain. The burger was larger than other veggie burgers I have had. It came with guac and cheese and a yummy sauce. The s.p. fries were great and it was one of the best veggie burgers I've had. I could not finish all the food I was given for $10. Although I'm a picky eater, I'd definitely eat at this food truck again. Thanks Burgers Amore!"}
{"text":"Best darned French Fries I have eaten in a long time.  Mmmmm.  Yummy burgers too.  Prices are reasonable given that the portions are huge.  Most items can be split between two people."}
{"text":"Truck came by my office in N Scottsdale today.  Had the special (non-menu) Diablo Burger.  Incredible burst of flavor, juices and a decent punch of heat.  Double patty burger with cheddar stuffed in patty topped with ghost pepper cheese and grilled jalapenos.  Amazing. Will definitely catch this truck again if around."}
{"text":"One of the biggest, griesiest best burgers I've had. Go big with the KING KONG. Just wish I would have added cheese!"}
{"text":"They stop at the UPX  cul-de-sac every other week and we look forward to this truck. It's delicious and service is good and it's not outrageously priced like most other trucks. The sister truck, something to do with queso  is also great."}
{"text":"Went to the Lake Pleasant Park party Saturday June 17.  These guys were the best option (IMO). I got a Godfather which is a double 1/3lb burger with cheese. It was excellent. Juicy and hot. I added avocado, yum. Hubs had the sweet potato fries, they were crispy, tender inside and not soggy. Thanks."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible food, Thirty minute wait for it too. Didn't get what I ordered. The best part was the soda. Also very expensive. $12 for burger fries and drink."}
{"text":"Extremely unhappy about this experience. Had lunch by them at comicon and not only is the lady taking orders and the cooks incredibly slow and unconcerned with their patrons, but the food was dreadful. My boyfriend and his friend ordered brats that were completely undercooked and raw and my chicken sandwich was so dry that it was almost a powder like texture as I ate it. We stood in 100Â° weather for 20 minutes for a lunch that any fast food restaurant charging a fraction of the cost could have beat. I do not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"We hired Burger Amore for a private party for 2 soccer teams; kids and parents. The teams are from chicago. We were in Phoenix for a soccer tournament and we wanted to do something different for a team dinner. So we decided to hire a food truck and have a party in a park. Working with Greg to coordinate was super easy. Very responsive, informative and easy to work with. The food was great. People were raving about the burgers (especially the black bean burger). However what blew us away was the service. 1 order taker, one cook and about 65 hungry people including about 30 \"hangry\" teenage girls who had played 2 soccer games that day. Could have been a nightmare. The lines moved quickly.  There were many comments about how amazing it was that there was only 1 cook and the wait for food was only a few minutes. Couldn't recommend burger Amore any higher."}
{"text":"Burgers Amore came to my work one day. I've heard of and have seen this truck a lot around the Valley. I was lucky enough to have forgotten my lunch that day. As I walked up they had just opened and the guys were working hard setting up. They put out fresh pickles, lettuce, onion, and tomato for you to put on your own sandwich, along with all kinds of condiments, even BBQ. All of which they kept covered and over ice. It was hard for me to decide what kind of burger I wanted. So I went with something I had never had before. A Black Bean Burger. It took no longer than 10 or so minutes and my Burger was ready. YUM!! I was pleasantly surprised, as I had been very nervous to even order it. For a burger made of mostly beans it held together very well and was full of flavor. Even had a nice char to it. It was topped with Guacamole and Pepper Jack Cheese that complimented the burger perfectly. Something I would surprisingly get again."}
{"text":"WOW!  I was going to an appointment outside of 4600 E Washington and big hurry so didn't get to stop for lunch and saw their truck on way in.  On the way out I stopped and ordered the Black-Bean Burger and some Sweet Potato fries.  YUM!!   So GOOD!  They lady who took my order was so sweet!!  Just made waiting the couple of minutes for my food even nicer.  Did I mention how good that Black-Bean Burger was?!  YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"I got Horchata from here and it was DELICIOUS. Also you get to keep the awesome Mason Jar. Also the guy who helped me was awesome and super nice."}
{"text":"I had the Bacon cheeseburger and it was ok, the crinkle cut fries could have been cooked longer- they were on the soggy side."}
{"text":"OMG...Worst Food Truck Ever. They come to the Ashland Ranch Spring Fling...selling overpriced hockey pucks...AFTER we pay they say it will be 45 minutes to an hour...Well an hour and 10 minutes later I \"got\" to eat the worst burger of my life. Sweet."}
{"text":"This truck needs some help.  The biggest problem is there are way too many choices for a food truck and I think it hurts their quality.  Options were listed at three different places including some combos listed elsewhere.    There were at least 13 burgers along with 4 different fry choices.  I got turkey burger with green chile and a chipotle sauce which I will admit was tasty.  However, I also got garlic, cheese fries.  These were terrible!  They tasted like frozen crinkle fries that were sprinkled with the Parmesan and garlic out of a shaker.    This truck would be so much better if they had a handful of options a day and rotated out their menu.  This way they can have a few options, but do them really well.  It is by far my least favorite food truck in PHX to date."}
{"text":"Had a Godfather burger with fries and it was really good.  At $11 for the combo I feel it was a good value also!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their freshly prepared Agua Frescas..../ Drinks! OOOOOHH WEE they were delicious! Drinks have huge pieces of fruit in them... and are $5.00 each. If you return the mason jar they give you $1 back! Can't wait to go back and try the rest! Perfect for a hot Phoenix day!"}
{"text":"Arizona Burger Tour Restaurant name: Burgers Amore  Judging Criteria:  First appearance: The burger, without toppings, is a perfect size with two slices of cheese to cover the entire patty.   Flavor:  The patty was seasoned well and evenly cook. Also, due to it's thickness, it had a great beef flavor that was complimented by the light toppings added. The only really downside I found was the it did have a slight greasy flavor due, I'm guessing, the heavily used cooktop. It put a slight damper on the complete burger.   Meat to bun ratio: The size and ratio of ground beef to bun is on point. Everything was perfectly proportioned and was finished all at once.   Included extras (veggies / condiments): There is a free toppings bar which included: Lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, red onion, mustard, ketchup and mayonnaise. I added it all in minimal amounts similar to standard hamburger restaurant.   Price: $6.00  Grade: A = Amazing burger. Wonderful flavorful and worth every penny. Worth traveling across town for."}
{"text":"We invited Burgers Amore to our company sponsored (paid) luncheon during a busy business week. The food was decent and seemed fair for the price per person we were charged. We were shocked to find out that one of the female cooks in the truck called one of our employees a \"Gordita.\" This was completely unacceptable and was very hurtful towards our company values and employees. We will not have them back and suggest they recognize this as a major business failure for our food truck community."}
{"text":"Truck came to my work today and boy was I impressed! Line was pretty long and it was hot out but food seemed to come out quick and piping hot! They had a ton of great options to chose from such as different burgers, chicken sandwiches, and even turkey burgers.   I went with the cowboy BBQ burger that was a 1/3lb patty with BBQ, bacon, and cheddar. Great size burger and the meat had great flavor. I love crispy bacon but it was a little burnt on the ends but none the less, this burger was amazing!!! I also got sweet potato fries that were easily the best I have ever had! Mouthgasm..... oh ya! Tasted like they were fried twice because they had that perfect crunch on the outside and soft in the outside. They also came out piping hot.  I did the fry toss when trying to sample one. Hot hot hot...   Overall everything was great and I got a great quality burger from this truck. I highly recommend. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. We had Burgers Amore and Queso Good cater our wedding and it was such a hit! Some of our favorite burgers are the Mac N Cheese burger and the green chili burger! Their catering services were outstanding and highly recommend them for any event you might have."}
{"text":"This trucked as scheduled to be where I work starting at 11:30 this morning. At 11:30 we all received an email saying Burgers Amore ain't coming. Booooo!  Oh well, burrito at Carolina's is a better option anyway."}
{"text":"Went to Food Truck Friday and decided to try these guys out and get a Blue Cheese Burger.  After waiting in line i was told \"opps, forgot to take the sign down, don't have blue cheese\".  I decided to get a Grilled Buffalo Chicken Sandwich instead and i was very pleased (even though i still wanted the burger).  They had a good selection of food, fries, drinks, etc., along with a whole condiment bar.  Next time i find these guys i will definitely get a burger!"}
{"text":"Burger & Fries food truck; they had run out of product by the time we arrived (it was the last hours they were scheduled to be there, so it was expected).  Just grabbed a simple burger with fries :) Nothing to really brag about! It was good, but when you're seriously ravenous, anything tastes good at that point lol!"}
{"text":"I'm glad they were at my place of employment today,as construction for our cafe was delayed I missed out on them last time and my coworker got a burger and fries from them and got more for their money then the food truck I went to glad I was able to get a burger this time it's delicious perfectly seasoned meat fries,and toasted bun"}
{"text":"Burgers Amore catered our wedding and all of our guests loved it! They said the burgers were delicious and they had great customer service! My brother said that it was the \"best sliders he has ever had!\""}
{"text":"The veggie burger is best ever! Guacamole, Chipotle sauce... yum! Yum! Yum! I had at food truck at work 2 nights in a row!"}
{"text":"Burger was not good and fries were undercooked and soggy  Could not even finish any of the meals by the 4 of us - what a shame"}
{"text":"Best Bacon Cheeseburger I've ever had! Fresh veggies  and quick service. What more can you ask for! If you're looking for a juicy perfected grilled burger this place is it. I love it! Simple, fast, tasty, full."}
{"text":"Decent burgers.  Decent price.  A lot of burger choices!"}
{"text":"Visited Fountain Hills yesterday for a music festival. It was a beautiful day and our stomachs were making hunger noises. So, there were two food trucks there and we decided on Burger Amore.  How did it go? Wrong choice. Burger was pre-cooked and very dry and bland. Tater tots were good though. Never again."}
{"text":"I'm really shocked by all of the reviews on here. I ordered the bacon burger and thought it was great. I also got sweet potato fries and they weren't bad either, just needed some salt. The truck people were very nice... Lots of variety and decent prices. I've been to many trucks that cost much more then this one. I would definitely eat this again."}
{"text":"This is the third time this truck has been to our work (We have a charity that we can donate to...if 85% of our employees donate to this charity, we get free food trucks paid for by the bossman) but only the first time I had eaten here (I went with the Queso Good truck the last 2 years).  I went with a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and some Sweet Potato Fries.  Solid food!  The cheeseburger was a good size (probably 1/3lb), and tasted great!  They use an artisan style bun which holds everything together very well.  It had good crisp bacon on it, nice melted cheddar, and a little bit of sweet bbq sauce.  Could not complain at all!  Now onto the sweet potato fries......I'm usually not the biggest fan of sweet potato items (fries, tots, pie etc), mostly due to them being kind of soggy.  I am happy to say that these sweet potato fries were bomb!  Crispy, hot, salted perfect and delicious!  Some of, if not the best sweet potato fries I have had.  I would come back to this truck just for them!  Service was friendly.  They had one lady taking orders and 1 (maybe 2?) people cooking in the truck.  Food was ready fast, it was tasty, and best of all, it was free for donating to a good cause (I would buy something off this truck with my own $$$ if I was out and about and saw it.  It was solid!)  I hope to see them again next year, if not sooner!"}
{"text":"While the Bacon Cheese and the Mac n Cheese burgers weren't BAD necessarily,  I was very underwhelmed. For a burger truck, I was hoping to get a phenomenal burger, but the bun was the heaviest part. It was just kind of bland and nothing more."}
{"text":"Tried this at Food Truck Friday.  Southwest Pork Burger with Sweet Potato Fries was awesome!"}
{"text":"I tried this food truck at the Willo Home Tour this past weekend.  I was starving so my review might be biased by my extreme hunger.  I got the classic burger with curly fries.  Both were excellent!  The burger meat was well seasoned and the fries were crispy, but not too crispy.  My food came out really quick, as in 30 seconds quick.  I wish I could have ordered the sweet potato fries, but they were sold out.  I think the classic burger might be too small to fill some people up because it's 1/3 lb patty - they might need to order a burger with 2 patties.  I saw that they do catering, I would be interested in hiring them for a catered event one day.  It would be a fun and unique addition to an event."}
{"text":"Loved it. Tried the bacon burger and it was fantastic. Great seasoning, perfectly toasted bun, crispy bacon.  It was excellent and pretty well-priced (7 or 8 bucks for that burger I think?)."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible experience. The owner paid for my meal just because of a friendly conversations had and wished me good luck on my future. Not to mention the grilled chicken sandwich and the tater tots were magnificent. I will be returning again soon."}
{"text":"$7 for a frozen turkey patty yuk out of a box .disgusting , very disappointed and paid extra $3 for sweet potatoes a little hand size full , it irritates me when I spend my hard earned money on something that's not quality and it shouldn't matter if it's a food truck or not ."}
