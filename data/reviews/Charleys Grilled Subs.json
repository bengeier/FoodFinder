{"text":"As my boyfriend and I was walking around the food court in the Metro Center Mall, one of the employees in front of Charley's Grilled Subs handed us a sample of their special limited time offer Chicken Sub (I don't see the exact name on their online menu).  After we tried a bite, we knew we were getting one.  :D  I guess the employee noticed our smile of approval so she handed us each a coupon to save $0.50 a sub.  Woot!  :)  The service was fast and subs were prepared as they were being ordered.  The regular french fries were really tasty.  Humorously packed in a cup, too!  :D"}
{"text":"Totally not the steak escape that used to be in the same spot. Very generic and poorly staffed. Don't think we will be back"}
{"text":"While the quality of food is what you would expect of a food court it is the employees that hurt the business most.  A cashier made the error of not ringing up our combo for the special and after sighing and exchanging glares with a fellow employee finally made the correction. This attitude was shared by fellow employees who snapped at us when we reached for our fries saying they weren't ours, they were.  Grumpy, snappy and seemingly annoyed by the customers theyre serving this was an uncomfortable visit for this customer. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Ive been going here for years! The food is always Awesome!  Always hot and fresh! The strawberry lemonade is Great! Definitely recommend The staff is always polite and friendly! One of the main reasons I first tried this place was because if the staff !I didn't get the persons name giving samples but she has been there since I was a kid! Her personality is so amazing and outgoing! !Ill definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I happened to be in Metro around lunch and decided to pickup a snack. We were offered samples of their sandwiches - all were good. We ordered cheddar-bacon fries and lemonade. Everything we tasted was surprisingly good for a food court store."}
{"text":"Had no issue with service as other reviews have stated. The woman was polite and I got my Cheese Fries immediately. On the other hand, they tasted a little vinegary and we're not really worth the $3.20 I paid for them."}
{"text":"As a sandwich lover aka connoisseur I love this place! I continuously visit here because the sandwiches are a perfect match every time. Yes they do try to lure you in with samples.. But if it wasn't for the samples I would have kept eating the same sandwich.i have tried multiple different kinds. And I am eased to say that every time they turn out fantastic. Most sandwich shops are   Inconsistent with taste. But these guys get it right every time. Will eat and try new sandwiches again and again."}
{"text":"Talk about the service being terrible!!  The mall was closing in about 30 minutes so I wanted to grab something to eat.  The manager was on his phone when I came up to the counter, so I waited.  He started talking to me while still on the phone.  He took my order while still on the phone.  I ordered a California chicken and it comes with ranch which was splattered all over the place.  I asked the manager where the napkins were, he pointed to the end of the counter.  I walked over there and there were no napkins.  I asked for a side of mayo and was told I had to pay 75 cents.  It is too bad that this location gives Charleys a bad name."}
{"text":"Not usually a big fan of Charley's, but this place actually did a good job from start to finish and may have changed my opinion about this sandwich chain.   I came here the other day as I was in the area and this was one of the few places that wasn't packaged for lunch. There was only one older couple in front of me when I got there. The young man that was at the register was so patient and polite with the older couple. They seemed like they didn't really understand or speak English very well, so they kept on going back and forth with their order and wanting to know everything that was in the subs that they were wanting to order. With all this, the guy seemed to not mind it and was calm and collected.   When I got up to the register, he smiled at me and asked how he could help me. I decided to order a small Jalapeno CheeseSteak with all the toppings. The cost was $5.69 before tax. I also ordered a large Triple Bacon CheeseSteak for a friend which cost $9.79. Both were made quickly and tasted so good!!   I had forgotten what it really was that I liked about Charley's and now I remember, their BREAD!! At least at this location, the bread was freshly baked, toasted perfectly to give it that crispy, flaky and buttery taste. They gave me a good portion of meat and toppings. Kind of overdid it with the jalapenos, but it was still good. Overall the subs were delicious!  I would definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"First time trying Charley's- The food ok-a little bland. I had the California Chicken sub. I did really like the bread. The gourmet fries were good-  If I had a coupon, I would go back. Maybe. But it was just ok- Nothing bad. But I didn't love it. The person taking my order needed to slow down. There wasn't a line behind me- Let me tell you what I want, then place the order. It's like she couldn't/wouldn't listen. But she was young. Maybe it was her first job?"}
{"text":"The service here was horrible!!!! I go to order my food trying to make up my mind what I want & the girl taking my order was trying to rush me. Not only that she had a very bad attitude & got smart with me when I told her I asked for peach lemonade not regular... The drink was not even the same color on the poster, looked like regular lemonade. It just had chunks of peaches at the bottom of the drink, which I almost choked on since I wasn't expecting that. The guys preparing the food barely speak English so I had a hard time understanding what they were asking me. They served me my sandwich without my fries that I ordered. I noticed fries sitting on their counter & had to ask if they were mine. They just sat them there & didn't notify. I don't think I want to eat here again!"}
{"text":"They still stand out in the walkway with a platter of samples, mostly trying to lure the lemmings out of the line to jump off the Mc-Cliff next door. They landed me with an unbarbed, straight hook (a toothpick) and some tastey bait made up of bread, chicken, cheese, bacon, and some sort of sauce. I didn't even ask the name, I just said I wanted whatever that chick is giving out, and a few minutes later I was eating a giant sized version of the teaser.   Apparently their specialty is the philly cheese steak style sammiches, but I'm not sure I'd try anything new for a while this sammy was s ogood, unless the platter chick is out fishing again with some new bait!"}
{"text":"The place is ok, it's a fast food place.The staff were not friendly. The food is nothing special, just regular subs. I would eat some where else the next time I visit the mall."}
