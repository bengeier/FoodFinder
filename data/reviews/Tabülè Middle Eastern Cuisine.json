{"text":"I highly recommend this place for a date & up to a group of 5 or 6. It is best to make a reservation. I've been here on a week day and on the weekend and it's been busy every time. I would recommmend the Tabule and Ma'anek (spicy beef sausage) to share. I've had the Tawuk (chicken skewers) and the Kefta Banadura (ground lamb and been in tomato sauce). I did not love the kefta because I compared it to Moroccan kefta I've had before, but it was still delicious and probably the closest to the best I'll find in Toronto. My cocktail of choice is Yalla Yalla which has bourbon, bitters, and egg whites. Everything here is delicious."}
{"text":"This is quite honestly my favourite restaurant in the city. My sister and I have started coming her more regularly and always leave full and very, very satisfied. The ambience is very cool (even the jug they use to pour water is something to see :) ) and the food is oh so delicious. Everything is flavoured so well. Some of our personal favourites are the hummus, (which my sister is actually addicted to), and the garlic shrimp. Sooo yummy!! We've sat at the bar the last few times because we walked in on a Friday night at 7:30 and were not shocked to hear that there was a wait. However we really lucked out as we were served by T (not sure of how his name is spelt). We received amazing, friendly and attentive service and were very impressed. From now on, we'll be making sure to opt for the bar every single time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere and great food. Highly recommend the fried cauliflower."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Tabule. We had an impromptu dinner on Friday night and managed to get seated during the evening rush without a reservation. The food and service were spectacular.   We had the falafel and hummus to start which were so tasty and delicious. For our mains we both had the chicken breast which was impeccably seasoned and so yummy We enjoyed everything and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our waiter was totally uninterested in doing his job. Maybe the manager should've given him a day off instead of ruining what was meant to be a good dining experience.  The food and atmosphere of the restaurant were pretty good. Overall service by the entire staff was unacceptable.   I don't plan on going here again."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in town! Highly recommended! The food is great and so is the ambience and the service.  The Beirut mojito is great. The beef+labni appetizer is also very good (I am forgetting the exact name). Hummus and labni are fantastic with warm Pita. The grilled chicken and the kefta were both delicious. Lastly, we had the gelato and loved the pistachio flavor. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner a couple weeks ago while on vacation in Toronto and I wasn't disappointed.    Ordered the hummus, babagan?j and fatt?sh salad to start. The hummus had just enough garlic, lemon and tahini sauce and the consistency was as it should be, smooth and creamy. The babagan?j was delicious the eggplant had just enough smokiness and puréed to perfection.  The salad was amazing, flavored with all the right middle eastern spices. My only complaint with the salad is that there wasn't enough.   For dinner i got the kefta and my friend ordered the garlic shrimp entree (boring).   My kefta dish was fantastic with the mixed lamb and beef being so juicy and perfectly spiced.  I did taste The shrimp plate was good as well but don't consider it middle eastern.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant food was incredible and the staff was on point.  On a side note I'm half Lebanese so i know how middle eastern food is suppose to taste."}
{"text":"We arrive at around 6:30pm and are welcomed by a calm and quiet dining room. In a gradual flow, the restaurant fills substantially before we manage to finishing pondering the menu. It was a full house by the end of the meal!  Tabule has an amazing twitter presence, and encourages diners to check in on Foursquare for a free personalized dip on your first visit. This portion is still more than enough for two people. My dining partner and I ordered a hummus and a baba gannouj, and they were delicious! I stuffed myself with dip and pita before the entrees even came.  We ordered the Chicken Breast entree, and it is served straightforward with simple sides of rice and grilled vegetables. The spices and seasoning is prominent, and enhanced through a nice smokey char. The meat itself was incredibly moist, and made even better with the accompanying yogurt and garlic sauce condiments!  The meal ends off with complimentary baklavas.  A decent Middle Eastern meal, especially for downtown."}
{"text":"I have picked up the Hallum salad with chicken ELEVEN times!  Im addicted!  its SO good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Tabule Restaurant - I have only gotten food from the Queen East Location but I am sure the Yonge St. Location is great too!  I got delivery from them about 4 weeks ago - and since - I have ordered lunch catering for clients on a weekly basis!  Their ingredients and recipes are SO fresh and absolutely home-made! The options are healthy and the portions are perfect!  I love Tabule and I am SO GLAD they are in my life!  Thanks Tabule for making such great food - and tanks for being so easy to order from - love that great customer service!!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here since it opened and have been slowly watching the quality go down. Meal we had last week will be our last. Pathetic portion of tabbouleh, labne that was not dressed the way it used to be, caauliflower not roasted the way it used to be and barely any tahini on it, the fattoush also was lackluster. Sad, as we live around the corner and this was one of our favourites in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Had the falafel dinner and it was delicious. The rice and lentils were great and the falafels were packed with flavor. The hummus is great too"}
{"text":"Tabule does wonderful mezes and the drinks menu is fantastic.  It was clean and bright, with both warm and modern touches.  The food was amazing and we would definitely go back.  We had the dip plate (not original but well executed), grape leaves (amazing) and fatoush and falafels salads, as well as the lentil soup.  All were very good.  The service was competent if not particularly friendly."}
{"text":"One evening in February I had my first dining experience at Tabule at the Riverside location and fell right in love with the ambience, the exceptional service and the food is to die for! In conversation I mentioned that this place would make for a nice wedding reception and after a few more dinners, email exchanges and telephone conversations with Diane she had made this happen. It was the easiest planning for typically a stressful event and we owe it all to Diane and her wonderful team for the memories made on our special day. A food menu had been arranged, the drink list selected, we took care of our own music and flowers and with Diane's suggestion we had a professional belly dancer perform which had added that extra perfect touch to our day.   We were wed at City Hall with our guests waiting for us at Tabule for the post-celebration. When we walked inside everything looked absolutely beautiful! The day had been relaxed and intimate with an abundance of delicious food ranging from stand up hors d'oeuvres, sit down appetizers, mains and desserts. Our friends and family are still raving about the attentive staff--some said it felt as if it were they who were the guests of honour!   My husband and I are no-fuss people and we had wanted a classy affair without the stress and by choosing Tabule we were able to offer our guests quality food and service. The process had been seamless and we are elated with having such a beautiful celebration to forever remember.   Thank you so very much Tabule!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Tabule by some friends who wanted me to eat following a really terrible breakup. I drowned my sorrows in incredible hummus, gluten free flatbread, eggplant and quinoa tabule. Helpful AND delicious.   Since then I've frequented both locations and especially love the atmosphere of the Riverside location. On weekends you'll be treated to an amazing bellydancer, which adds great entertainment to what is already a stellar meal. Service is friendly and quick, and they are very allergen friendly. The sample platter appetizer is a great way to share a bunch of things on the menu and for $14 is a good portion. Their cocktail menu is wonderful as well. The sample platter plus 2-3 things off the menu is a great amount of food for 2 people to share.   Great date restaurant and an awesome night out! I've had great luck making same day reservations."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here with a girlfriend on a Thursday night. Tabule takes reservations on Open Table, which I found very helpful (although the hostess didn't acknowledge the reservation in the Open Table system and I needed to contact them to receive my points and confirm that I wasn't a no show).  We ordered a couple of the hot & cold mezze to share. The cold sharing platter (babaganüj, tabule & labni) was by far the best dish. Everything in it was very flavorful. We ordered a few of the hot mezze which weren't nearly as good as the cold mezze: we tried the fried eggplant, which was bland a bit too oily for my liking. We also ordered the garlic shrimp, which was the worst value. The plate is $12 and you get 5 shrimp. The sauce itself is supposed to be spicy, but I didn't find it to be. It was a basic tomato sauce and the dish was room temperature, which is a bit unappetizing for shrimp. Lastly we got the maane (lebanese spicy sausage) which were an unusual, but good, flavor combination.  For dessert we shared the baklava (it was plenty to share), which was outstanding.   The staff was competent and efficient, but not overly familiar. I appreciate that, as I don't need to be the waiters friend! We were there for 2.5 hours and they didn't try to hustle us out. I love the décor and the open windows at the front. This would be a wonderful place to have a group of 5-6 people. The restaurant itself gets quite loud, and is a more jovial, rather than romantic, atmosphere.  I'm definitely going to come by and try some of the grilled entrees, which looked delicious."}
{"text":"I organized a dinner for my mother's birthday at Tabule several weeks back. 5 of us shared most everything and thoroughly enjoyed it! The only reason I didn't give a five star review is because we had a very small table and found it quite a tight squeeze. The servers didn't accommodate but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! We split the eggplant, cauliflower and grilled veggies for appetizers and then had the kefta bandura as a main. Everything was very flavourful and well portioned. We left very satisfied and with a new place to take guests."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff fantastic atmosphere with belly dancing and music. Must haves are the labna, kefta and the mahallabiah."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We got a spot on the patio...loved it!  Even the inside decor is pretty. Service was excellent. We went for a late dinner around 9:30 so we didn't eat too much, but whatever we ordered was great. My husband and I shared the hummus, beef sausages, and kefta. The pomegranate Mojito (called Habibi) was really good! Definitely have to go back when we are hungry and order more items."}
{"text":"4.5/5! I have had a great experience every time I have been to Tabule (both locations). The food is fresh and the service is fantastic. I recommend the sample platter to start. For mains, try to Kefta Banadura, garlic shrimp entree, eggplant and the falafel entree. The drinks are unique so if you are in the mood for something different try to jallab marrakesh. You can easily share dishes at this place so go with a crowd in order to try a bit of everything, noting though that the portions are relatively large. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Great service, really good food.  Portions were perfect.  Creative cocktail list as well."}
{"text":"LOVE tabule! Was there with 3 girlfriends for a birthday Friday night and the food and service was exceptional. This was my first visit to this location and I was nothing less than thrilled with the entire experience. I was greeted by a lovely young girl and seated right away even though the rest of my party was late. Our server was truly amazing, I believe her name was Ashta. She recommended some amazing dishes, and even accommodated our vegan friend with tasty meatless options. She was genuine, sweet, and fast. Only comment is that it was quite loud so the music wasn't audible, which would've been a lovely touch to an already great evening.  Absolutely recommending to my friends and family! Oh - she also put a candle in our dessert without being asked, highly recommended for a nice birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"I have never had a meal that didn't completely satisfy, at either of the Tabule locations.  The app sampler is a staple, best baba ganoush I've ever had.  Hummus is awesome, as is the tabbouleh .  The lamb is tender, lean and juicy.  The prices are very reasonable considering the portion sizes.  I typically split the app sampler and lamb kabob dish with another person and I still have leftovers to take home.  Great date spot.  Reserve in advance."}
{"text":"Here for dinner and we thoroughly enjoy cold and hot meze. The babaganoush was amazing, flavor with deep smoke. Tabule salad was nice and simple with a lot of lemon juice. The main of lamb was cook to the right temp, but rice and vegetables a bit underwhelming. Portion are decent size for sharing.  Yonge st location is small and dark, could have better decor. May need to check out their new location. Service was OK could see staff leaving early. We were left waiting in the end for our bill."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  Everything is very tasty.    The service and crankiness of the servers definitely need some improvement."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended - fresh ingredients, great ambience and patio, proper food. This will accommodate all of your vegetarian and particular eating friends with the menu - but it is not flavourless. Literally everything is tasty and recommended."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous dinner here this past weekend.  Our group of 5 adults shared most everything, and it was a great way to try the dips, salmon, kefta, lamb chops, cauliflower, eggplant, falafals, etc. etc. etc.   Everything was delicious!  The server was fairly helpful with our ordering, ensuring there would be enough for everyone.  Also loved my non-alcoholic juice - mint limeade.  So refreshing!!  The atmosphere is relaxed, and clean with a beautiful aesthetic.   A great buzz - we were there at dinner time on a Sunday, and the place was full and bustling.  We also noticed tons of take-out orders going out the door.  Family-friendly - we were not the only table with a baby, and they happily provide highchairs."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for dinner on Valentine's day. The waitress was incredibly sweet and knowledgeable of the items on the menu. The atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable, with a hint of sophistication. I ordered the Lamb and my girlfriend ordered the shrimp. The food was served quickly and was absolutely delicious. The lamb was grilled to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning. The sauce my girlfriend's shrimp was prepared with accentuated the dish perfectly. Great experience. Would recommend to everyone. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. Everything we ordered was very fresh and it wasn't a long wait for the food. The staff was also very accommodating of dietary restrictions. It's a great  spot for a dinner on a weeknight or to visit with family/someone special. Loved their food and service, definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. Highly recommend the fried cauliflower and also the garlic shrimp. Out of this world!"}
{"text":"While I still love the food here I dont think I'd be dinning there anymore due to their lack of service. I called Thursday morning to book fro Friday night and I was told they had no spots left!!!! Instead they try to stick me with a 545 or 9 o'clock dinner reservation! Times where I am going to make wild yes: they are deserted. I was walking by on Friday at the time when I actually wanted to dine and ask them if I could get a table and they said sure! When I mention to them their insistence that they could book me the night before because they had no tables they just smiled and dismissed. I walked away"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time at Tabule. The food is good, the decor is classy and the prices are reasonable. The best part is the service was amazing. New favourite spot in the east end. You should go!"}
{"text":"If you want good food, come here. If you want good food and good service, avoid this restaurant.  After reading some of the reviews, it seems as though it's hit and miss with Tabule. The food is good - I'll give it that (at least the dips, I'll give it that). The service is absolutely abhorrent - so much that I will never return.  Arrived for our 7:15 reservation. We were promptly seated. About 15-20 minutes after we were seated, we were finally asked what we wanted to order. We gave our food and drink order and asked for 2 glasses of water - which was odd, since most restaurants fill your water when you are seated. 30 minutes after we were seated, we finally got our glasses of water, and this was only because I had asked the server a second time for the water.  35 minutes AFTER ordering our dinners, the server returns to tell me that my meal is not available. To put this into perspective, this is now 50 minutes after being seated. Now, I get that restaurants run into issues with food, etc. But I expect to be told when I order, or 5 minutes after I order. But not when I should have that plate of food in front of me. He asks me if I want something else. Did he hand me a menu? Nope. I had to ask for the menu. By the time I got that, it was an hour in. I was so worried about the time it would take to get my hubby's dinner that I decided to forego ordering anything. Given we were almost an hour in, I didn't want to delay his meal any longer and the speed at which this place operates is horrendous. He didn't get his meal for another 20 minutes (perspective = 80 minutes after being seated).  They comped my drink. I'll give them that. But it wasn't enough. I didn't even get an apology. And i left hungry, without dinner - at 9:40 pm.   So never again. You can have great food, but when someone doesn't get the opportunity to even try it, it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Really enjoy eating here, it's a staple east end spot with really great atmosphere and wonderful food. Most nights you can walk in, or sit at the bar without a reservation, the back patio is key! Only reason it's missing the last star is that the service is a little inconsistent, some days are fast, some are super slow... which I don't understand since the food is so simple, ie: I mostly order the dip plates, fried cauliflower, baked eggplant, and the kefta kebob, all extremely delicious winners... The lamb kebobs are also fantastic, although do not order them medium well and up because they dry out very easily. All in all one of the best spots on the east side for a nice and easy dinner out!!"}
{"text":"I have been to both of their locations, on Queen E. and Yonge near Eglinton. We have tried a few different appetizers and entrees, and they are all delicious. The service is always excellent too. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"It's about time I add my accolades-- having either dined or obtained takeout at this neighbourhood gem about a billion times since they opened.    It's a great addition to Riverside. Things to love: a beautifully decorated space that makes you feel as though it's a proper outing; decent to excellent service;  a large patio (benches); reliable food. I have taken friends, parents, teammates from out of town and everyone has enjoyed themselves.     Best bets: - Labneh, a strained yogurt cheese...you get get the 'sample platter' and add baba ghanoush, the eponymous tabbouleh, or hummus.  This is a sharing platter good for 3-4 people or more. They also offer gluten free bread for an additional fee. - Fried eggplant: super tender and crispy.  I always order this. - Lentil soup is perfectly balanced, rich, filling and vegan.  A bargain.  The cocktails are refreshing and pay tribute to middle eastern flavours; and there are plentiful alcohol-free beverage options (not just water) for your preggy/detoxing/non-drinking friends.  The food is not complicated or particularly inventive but well-executed for what it is. There are the usual mediterranean options for veggies: chickpeas in all of its many forms; and eggplant. Woe to vegetarians who don't like eggplant or chickpeas.  The salmon, lamb and beef skewers are nice and tender (sometimes under salted to my palate); and for paleo/low carb people: you can sub your rice for more veggies.  Portions are sizeable and it's easy to over-order and over-eat!  They'll wrap things up so you can take them home, or order a few apps and split a main.  And they do this cute thing of pouring your water from really high up.   (Skip dessert and go to Ed's Real Scoop in Leslieville if you have room!)"}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot a few years ago usually to celebrate special occasions. We've had issues with this place before like being served raw chicken but the servers were always good with making things right. We decided to come back to celebrate my husbands birthday again with the whole family(9 of us). I called earlier in the day to make reservations but somehow they had lost our reservations. They kept insisting that there was no reservation but I have the call logged on my phone. The person I spoke to even said our name/number was on file. Anyway, we end up getting the worst server who must have been having a terrible day or just has a terrible attitude. She kept rolling her eyes and spoke so rudely to us. I ended up ordering less food just to end my conversation with her. I wanted to request a new server but my husband said to let it go. At the end of the night, my husband thanked her on his way out and all he got was a blank stare and no response. Well, that's the last time we'll ever be eating here. Thanks for the terrible evening Tabule."}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Took my husband for lunch here today.  Epic fail.  We had the babaganuj, tabule, labni, cauliflower, falafel, and kubbeh.    Babaganuj (1/5) -Did not like it at all.  Tabule (1/5) -Did not like it.  Labni (2/5) -Ok.  Cauliflower (1/5) -Greasy  Falafel (3/5) -Good.  But  I am not going to a restaurant just for a falafel.    Kubbeh (0/5) -Very wheaty after-taste.  Small.  Not meaty.    The food was awful and I have eaten middle eastern food practically all my life.  The only thing I liked was the falafel.  And I don't know why everyone was ranting about the cauliflower; it was just deep fried with tahini poured on top.  It tasted like greasy cauliflower.  And the kubbeh was heavy on the bulgur.  They were so small and barely any meat.  I was irritated by their menu.     My husband was disgusted by one of the waitresses whom was hugging someone and playing with a dog and went to serve people food without washing her hands.  My husband hated the food there and felt sick after.    Me and my husband were totally not satisfied after the meal.  And he did not stop complaining the whole time.  And by the way, the party of 6 whom were sitting beside us gave us negative comments about the food too. And one of  the guys made the comment that the one at the Yonge location is worse."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, service is great and cute little location. And good portions. Definitely get the sample dip platter, garlic tomatoes, garlic shrimp and 3 different kebabs. We had the chicken, lamp and mixed beef lamb kebabs. All were Delicious!  Only thing is the bathrooms are in a little bit of an inconvenient location but aside from that superb food!"}
{"text":"Middle Eastern Cuisine that's only half decent but waay overpriced. If you can't offer fresh pita you're already in trouble. Fans either haven't ever had good cheap authentic or are paying for the ambiance, don't buy the hype."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I had the falafel  dinner. It was delicious and the portions were decent. The Morrocan tea is a must. They serve it in the fancy tea pot. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Shannon, bar tender was such a joy to be placed with when we could only be seated at the bar. Food was exceptional and authentic middle eastern flavour. Baba gannouch, tabule, kafta and Tawokk are musts! Also loved the Habibi cocktail!"}
{"text":"The decor is lovely and the service is pretty good.  The food is lacking. To start, we had the Falafel, which was serviced with the tiniest saucer of tahini.  If you wanted a dolop of tahani sauce for every falafel, well, you are out of luck.  My SO had the chicken skewers for his main, and I had the Keft banadura (ground lamb and beef skewers in tomato sauce).  Both dishes were incredibly overseasoned, and so salty that we were not able to finish them all.  When we asked the waitress if the meat is always as salty as it is, she told us \"well, you can ask for it to be less salty when you order!\".  Which would help, if you went into the restaurant with an understanding that food is so salty that you can't eat it unless you tell them to tone it down.  Seriously, what restaurant operates that way?  Anyway, I won't go back."}
{"text":"Quite literally the best dining experience I've ever had in Toronto.  Food is incredible. I had the lamb (cooked MR), fiance had the kefta banadura - both incredibly well delivered, so flavourful. Also had the sampler plate with hummus, babaganuj, and labni - delicious. Had a bit of fried eggplant - MUST GET AGAIN.  Our server was lovely and very tolerant of our reunion antics. He was also an incredible doll in terms of splitting our bill, and trust me, we were a difficult bunch to split.   Remember - while you can order wine there, Tabule is also BYOB with no corking fee! I absolutely adore everything about the place.  Heads-up, you should make a reservation. It gets busy."}
{"text":"Love! Great atmosphere and fantastic food. Perfect for catching up with a group of friends or a romantic night out. Chill beats. Only downside is the seating can be quite close and difficult to maneuver through when it's busy."}
{"text":"I dropped by at 6:30 on a Friday night with a friend. The place was packed!! We actually had reservations for 8:30 but since we were early we decided to try our luck. The only option was to sit at a community table. Super quishy, but we didn't want to wait. It ended up being fine, since the whole restaurant was packed anyways and we were seated right away.  The servers all pour water like how you are supposed to pour Morrocan mint tea. Some were more confident than others, but quite a little performance each time the water is refilled!  The food here is ahhhmazing!! It's grilled meat heaven. And the portions are huge! I got the grilled lamb which came with veggies and müjaddara, all for $21.50 (super cheap for an entree in that area). I love lamb so I was all kinds of happy with the big succulent pieces of lamb. It was a bit dry at first because my dish didn't come with sauce. Turned out our waitress forgot to offer us a trio of sauces (garlic sauce, hot sauce and something else) which she brought out soon after.  This is not a place where you come to chill out with a long leisurely dinner. It's small, its packed, the waiters nearly brush up against you as they pass. So we ate and got outta there. Maybe it's less crowded on weeknights?!  Either way, I'll be back for the delicious food, great prices and huge portions."}
{"text":"I have ever been disappointed with Tabule, having had delivered catering for late-night meetings at the office, as well as loungy-type dinners with family and friends, which we did at this location on Queen Street. Always impressed. Catering menu has a good selection, and I usually get a pita (falafel or skewer) for each person, which is loaded with toppings. Then I order side dishes, such as steamed eggplants, tabuleh, hummous, and babaghanoush. They even provide extra pitas as well (and hot sauce!). As for the dinners, we were impressed  by the simplicity of the cooked cauliflower with tahini drizzled on top. The meats are nicely cooked, flavourful, and not overdone. The lamb-beef balls mix was lovely, stewed in herby tomato sauce. Their summerlicious menu was great value for the money- three courses for $25 and the dessert was really unique, something I never heard of- a creamy thing drizzled with rose oil! Always lovely. Try it for a step away from the ordinary Middle-Eastern takeout."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my boyfriend and left so disappointed. We sat on the patio and were ignored. There were 5 staff members which we had to eventually flag someone down to place our order. The food was tasty (we both ordered salads) but was not enough. We had the intention of ordering more food but no one came back to check on us. I heard the servers going around to other tables letting them know the kitchen was closing and asking if they wanted to order anything else. We sat with our empty plates for a while before again flagging someone down to bring us the bill. The restaurant was not that busy so I'm not sure why we were ignored and given poor service. Everyone else around us seemed to be getting proper service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We came back because we loved it the first time and we're pleased we did. We love it here. Only downside is that everyone loves it too.   Great starters, haloum salad to start and share. We shared the fish of the day and the falafel mains. More than enough, perfectly cooked and plenty food to fill the largest bellies.   Finished with Lebanese coffee...wow the espresso infused with cardamom is to die for.   Great price, great staff. Shout out to Bre, great service.   If there is a downside it's that the secret is clearly out. You need to book or wait for a table for some time."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite spots, the hummus here is perfect! The outdoor patio is just some thing else! Enjoy it while u can! It's nice quite romantic and perfectly decorated! The food here is near perfect with pickets that are at just a perfect sodium level! The only problem I can see is its hard to get seating at times ( make reso) and the portions are just a little too small! Other then that it's all fresh, flavourful and unique! It's a very nice little spot and every one should check it out"}
{"text":"Passed by this place for lunch. It's a really nice place. Service was good, food is excellent and fresh. Place is clean and well kept. I'm sure this business will do very well in Leslieville. Most people that go seem to really enjoy it. Can be a bit pricy though."}
{"text":"We had heard great things about Tabule, with another location already on Yonge. Man, was this an incredible meal :) First of all, make a reservation. We had one for 6:30 and it was already hopping with couples and families. When we left at 9:00, it was still lined up out the door. On the service, amazing from the front door reception, to our server, Jennifer, who was one of the best ambassadors for a restaurant I have ever seen. Easy to get her attention, despite the business of the place. Happy, and genuinely so. Really had an ability to bond with us and make our night special. AMAZING cocktail menu. Loved the Old Fashioned Hookah. And the food? Superbly fresh from start to finish, and kudos on the attention to Gluten Free, which one of our party was. We started by sharing the 3-dip plate, plus the Akaawi cheese (OMG....) and the falafel. For the main we all had the skewers, and the chicken, beef and beef/lamb mix were all amazing. Top that off with superb after-dinner drinks and Lebanese coffee and you have a total winner. The successful mix for me comes from the menu, the service, the price point, and the vibe. Tabule has it all."}
{"text":"Was excited to finally try Tabule, but left disappointed. Upon arrival, things looked promising. The back patio is lovely, servers were friendly and very considerate of dietary restrictions. Cocktails were mediocre. The kumquat was fine, but the Beiruit sangria - which was described as strong - tasted more like syrupy juice. We started with the hummus and babaganuj - both had the texture of the grocery store varieties. Next, we had the hallum salad, which was also fine, but didn't salvage our dining experience. On the waitress' suggestion, we shared the kefta banadura, which was dry. The portion sizes were generous, especially according to Toronto standards, but a moot point given that we didn't care much for the food anyway."}
{"text":"We came as a big group. Food is really delicious and easy to share. Best part, the staff split the bill for each of us accurately based on each dish. It was amazing! I have no idea how she did it. Also, kindly pointed out that because it is a group, the tip is included on each bill. I really appreciate that move.  100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Tabule (Riverside/Leslieville). Baba Ghanoush and Falafel were amazing . Very dissappointed with the fried eggplant and cauliflower. It only took 2 bites to throw me off - Both were soggy, not drained and soaking in oil. Our server was polite but hard to get a hold of, despite being one of the three occupied tables in the restaurant. I doubt I will be back, unless it's for takeout Baba Ghanoush."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day with my husband and this place did not disappoint. Atmosphere was perfect and portions were great. I had the kefta bandara and my husband had the fish. The tomato sauce was very flavorful and the meat quite tender and moist. Perfect date spot!"}
{"text":"I've been to the middle east and had amazing cuisine in the motherland, so I can firmly say, Tabule is nothing special.  Everything was fine, but nothing was outstanding.  I was expecting mind blowing falafels and dips but the best thing I ate was probably the mujadara that the mains could be served with.  The seating was also incredibly uncomfortable, the chairs for the table in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by other tables on all sides were too close, I didn't particularly enjoy the constant jostling from the foot traffic trying to make its way around the restaurant.  I probably won't be back if it was up to me."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! We came on a Monday evening and it was packed, which I take as a good sign. Food was amazIng! Huge flavours and you could really taste the quality. This was possibly the best middle eastern food I've had. Great service as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Perfect patio! I had the kumquat mojito... Spectacular, fresh ingredients...mmmmm so yum yum!  Then we had the cauliflower and a garlic tip recommended by our waiter extraordinaire Troy!    I ended to having the beef with rice and veggies - so tasty.  Can't get over the place!!! Get over there"}
{"text":"I came here on a week on a week night. Upon entering, we noticed it had very nice décor.  However, I would not recommend it if you are catching up with a friend because it is super loud and you'll lose your voice by the end of the meal.  My friend and I got seated.  We had to flag a server down and were told that we would have to wait for our server.  Our server never came around so we had to flag another down and they were kind enough to take our order.   We then had to flag down another server to get water for our table.  Our meal took awhile to which took me by surprise because the traffic in the restaurant was dying down as it was past 8pm.  The kefta I ordered was very dry and I also noticed a hair in my food midway through.  I will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant !  Went on a Friday night around 630 was lucky to get seated for a parrt of 5 as there was a group reservation that never showed up. Very packed house so make sure u reserve !   APPETIZER  Got the platter that came with 3 items. We got the hummus, babaganuj and the tabule. It was all very basic. Nothing crazy wow.    ENTREE GET THE LAMB! Whether its the skewers or lamb chops. They were both perfectly seasoned and very very tender melt in your mouth.   If you're not into lamb then I would suggest the eggplant if you like that stuff. Love the lentil rice it came with. It was quite tasty .    One friend tried the kefta banadura and was not impressed... even though all the reviews raved it. I tried it and it was a little dry."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with a group of friends, we got a place on the pretty patio. One of my friends ordered the jallab lemonade which is a middle eastern beverage with date molasses, rose, lemon, soda, pine nuts and raisins. The mixture of ingredients sounds like it would be absolutely disgusting but it was pretty tasty! If you know and love the dark brown italian drink chinotto (or Brio) then you'll like it, it tastes a lot like that. I ordered the beirut sangria, which was passion fruit juice, watermelon juice, st. germaine liquer, white wine, prosecco, orange blossom and mint-it was really refreshing, the watermelon is the main flavour that comes through.   For appetizers we shared the hummus and the fried cauliflower with tahini. Both were delicious!  For the main dish I ordered the kefta (meatballs of lamb and beef mixed with a side of rice and grilled vegetables). The meat was cooked perfectly and had great flavour and the rice and vegetables went well with it. All grilled meats came with rice and vegetables. My friends got the salmon, farm-raised chicken, and one of my friends ordered the falafel balls with rice that was mixed with lentils and tomatoes. The falafel dish was the best in my opinion (I tried it), it was spicy and delicious.  For dessert I had the mango sorbet which was a pretty good portion and had amazing flavour.   Definitely recommend this place, we all loved the food so much and it has a great ambiance! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the waiters' multiple mistakes-forgetting to give my friend change until we pointed it out, charging the wrong price and having to go through the transaction again."}
{"text":"I love their gluten free flat bread and that's enough for me to go back there again and again.   They have a huge selection for gluten free and it doesn't lack on taste, or quality!  My vegan friend loves this place too!"}
{"text":"Tabule knows exactly what it is.  This comes from years of delivering a unique and authentic blend of delicious middle eastern cuisine at the Yonge and Eglinton location. Our server tonight appears to have worked at that original spot and the overall quality of service and expertise of the staff, hostess and manager showed consistent attention to detail and experience.   The unique cocktails Yale Yale?? Delicious and a great recommendation from our waiter.  Lamb skewers, and the \"middle eastern prosciutto\" are a must."}
{"text":"The best of everything and incredible flavour and serving size. Only crumb--being asked to move to the bar by the hostess after we finished eating dinner, (but still ordering wine); only to be told later that they didn't need to move us after all."}
{"text":"It's a love hate relationship with Middle Eastern Cuisine and me. I love that it tastes so good, but then compare to the food I've eaten during my travels (or with my inlaws) and I have a hard time justifying the cost.   The place here is a great addition to leslieville. The decor is modern, yet homely. You wouldn't think you're in a middle eastern place, but it isn't that far removed that it's out of place.   Food is a bit expensive, but expected. Appetizers (mezze) of hummus and babaganoush with pita can end up being $15, when normally these are staples that are given for free and in generous amounts when in the home country. But this is a similar practice in north american middle eastern restaurants I find. We did order the falfafel and they were perfectly cooked (for my standards anyway). You get 6.   I got the Kefta - they have three kinds, one that is plain, one that is sold out and one with tomato sauce. It was tasty, but not mind blowing.   Service was slow. We were there for a good 30 mins before our food was served. I was also quite disappointed when I took home my meal, that it was in a cardboard box that eventually soaked through, and leaked all over my car. Wasn't fun to clean, nor was it appetizing to eat afterwards.   I liked it, but not dying to come back. Also service needs to be quicker, especially for the lunch time crowd."}
{"text":"I invited my girlfriend and a relative for lunch out in the Queen East area. I was persistent that we go some where new in the area to get some variety and experience something new. I really loved walking into the place, had a really nice authentic feel on a pleasant October Saturday afternoon!  We ordered the meal for the table to all split; here is what we ordered and what i recommend fully: Hümmus, Babaganüj, Tabülè, Akaawi Cheese, Fried Eggplant, Falafel and Tawük (Chicken kababs). Drinks: ginger cinnamon tea, moroccan mint tea, mint limeade. The food was all very delicious with all guests commenting on how everything was very tasty and fresh.  Small comment but the ginger cinnamon tea had very little taste (no flavour of ginger what so ever) and i was a little disappointed as when i looked in the pot it was a tea bag where as the moroccan mint tea have fresh, whole ingredients. It is no big deal but worth mentioning i think.  On my way our i grabbed the takeout menu and i cannot wait until the next time we order food to the house!"}
{"text":"Sampled a bunch of items off of their menu during the few times I've visited this restaurant for dinner. Overall the food, atmosphere and service have been top notch. A bonus: really great back patio!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time has been a wonderful experience. Their skewered roasted meat plates are superb - flavourful, juicy, and using premium ingredients (locally sourced, humanely raised etc.). Veggie options like falafel are amazing - crispy, well-spiced - not oily at all. Well-portioned. Friendly service. The place itself is airy, clean, and bright with large open windows onto the street. Clean washrooms are downstairs. Will be back for many more occasions."}
{"text":"I always overeat when I go there. It reminds me of the food I had in Turkey. Try their Kumquat cocktail, it's unique and delicious."}
{"text":"The patio spot here at Tabule is quaint, cozy, and comfortable.  A raise wooden deck with some comfy benches and chairs with lights strung across the top to create a little yellow canopy.  The place was packed to the brim but the wait was worth it to get a chance to try the menu.  We ordered the hummus appetizer which was smooth, buttery, flavourful, and had the squeeze of citrus to brighten it up.  The second appetizer of falafel was a tad disappointing because it looked like they have been over-fried.  What should have been a light brown and crispy sphere was a deep dark brown crust that took too much effort to pierce with a fork.  What do I mean by that?  Well I was trying to poke one lightly with my fork and the falafel decided to bounce off the plate and onto the floor.  :-(  That was redeemed by the lamb kefta which was delightful.  It was cooked nicely and had a lot of zip (spices) in the meat.  The rice and roasted veggies complements were very nice as well.  We were too full to ponder about dessert but sat on the patio a while longer to enjoy the warm evening."}
{"text":"Second time at Tabule on Queen, after several visits to Tabule on Yonge.  Have always enjoyed my meals there: dips are delicious, consistently gone for the shrimp entree which I've enjoyed although probably more known for their skewers. Cocktail menu is inventive with some unique drinks. Space is beautiful and bright.  Even though I'm not gluten free day to day, I was doing a cleanse and found it a great place to go with a ton of options (which is not easy to find).  I found our server a bit curt on our most recent visit - and the restaurant quite loud, however, there was a massive group (20+) with a ton of young kids sitting right beside us. While it wasn't a problem at all, and they left midway through our meal, on the occasions I've been there I wouldn't say the restaurant is the place to go for a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely meal here with my mom after an evening of bridal gown shopping just down the street.  Our server was very sweet and attentive, which is always appreciated.  For starters, we opted for the hummus with fresh pita bread, a side of mixed pickles and the falafel salad. Hummus was super smooth and flavourful, yum! I love pickled pretty much anything so totally enjoyed the pickles plate, which was comprised of olives, pink turnip, and hot peppers. The falafels were awesome - not dry in the middle at all and super crispy on the outside, perfection! Also loved the bright, fresh tasting dressing on the salad.  We both ordered seafood entrees for our mains. My mom got the grilled shrimp and I selected the baked red snapper. Both dinners were cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned. Their rice was so so good - if I wasn't so stuffed I would have kept eating.  To end the meal, we shared a pot of Moroccan mint tea and the dessert (sorry I forget the name) comprised of warm custard, angel hair flio pastry, honey, and crushed pistachios - it was just heavenly!   While I don't venture out to this neck of the woods often, I look forward to trying another one of Tabule's other three locations in the near future."}
{"text":"**Note that I looooove Lebanese and Middle Eastern food, so there's a built-in bias here as I find Toronto has very few restos to chose from in this category.** Very impressed with Tabule, and will definitely be back.  We went early (before 6:30pm) on a Tuesday and most of the tables were already reserved. By 7pm it had filled up and there was a pretty lively noise level. Decor is semi-formal but clean, comfortable, not stuffy or snobby. Good diversity and selection on the menu: there's something for everyone with enough vegetarian or fish options, if that's your thing. We had the Hallum salad, it was good but not too exciting, so next time I would try Fattush maybe. Babaganoush appetizer was simple but delicious: recommend! For dinner we had the red snapper and kefta, both of which were well-seasoned, moist and cooked perfectly, with simple grilled veggies over rice. Very reasonably priced ($80 for two with appetizers and beer), especially compared to some of the other bistros and hot-spots in the neighbourhood. Oh, and they had a great selection of local beers. We didn't do dessert but the one I saw at the table over looked good. Finally, I should mention that service was excellent: our waitress was extremely helpful and pleasant, and our water glasses were never empty. Much appreciated. A great night overall!"}
{"text":"This is the best middle eastern cuisine I've ever had. This place is always busy and you usually need a reservation. Food is amazing, try the kefta banadura for your main and the sample platter for your app. Well worth the price! I've come here for 3 years and will continue to come, it never disappoints. Great service too, attentive."}
{"text":"Yum yum. Tabule hits all the right spots when it comes to Middle Eastern cuisine. The decor, lighting and music is really nice and makes for a great atmosphere.  This place is quite affordable if you have someone to share your meals with. My friend and I ordered quite a lot and our total was probably $60 with taxes and tips for 2 ppl. We had:   - The Sampler Platter w/ Hümmus, Babaganüj, and Tabülè. In order of preference, I have to say Tabülè was the clear winner. It's so refreshing and I didn't expect to like it. Tabule at Paramount Find Foods is not even comparable. Depending on your preference, Babaganüj might be a bit too sweet. Personally, I prefer Hümmus and then the Babaganüj. You get pita bread with these spreads and can ask for free refills. If you get this platter, try one of the spreads with Tabule.  - Cauliflower, was soft and pretty tasty. Nice little appetizer but not filling if that's what you are looking for.  - Falafel, kind of too crunchy for me but also delicious and a tiny bit spicy. But I'm really sensitive to spicy food. My friend couldn't taste it at all though. Lol.  - Lentil Soup (bowl size). It was okay, but since there is no cream or butter.. Not as smooth for me. Idk. I think I prefer it with some creamy texture so, probably pass on this one next time. Paramount makes a really great Lentil soup FYI.  - Kefta, also good. The mixed lamb and beef tasted a bit salty but was balanced by the rice. We were honestly stuffed but had to try it before packing it to go.   I would definitely come back here. Perhaps to try the Labni (a homemade Lebanese yogurt spread) and the teas. We spotted some diners with the Garlic Tomatoes dish, which looked interesting too. Yeah, we are foodies that eye other people's dishes for future reference. Lool."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've had in a restaurant in Toronto. While the food was good, the service was absolutely appalling. I am still in shock as I write this review. I went with a date to this place last night. I won't go into all of the details, but I will say that the waitress and the manager were both incredibly rude and unprofessional in making us feel incredibly rushed to order and get out of there for their next round of people. It has been a long while since I've been anywhere where I felt this kind of pressure that was conveyed in such a rude manner. I was at Buca a few weeks where it's pretty hard to get a reservation unless it's awhile in advance, and where they are always fully booked, and the waitress gave me and my friend plenty of time to make each of our decisions and fully enjoy our meal. I will not be frequenting this restaurant ever again, and will be letting my friends know to avoid it. I think they really need to understand that people go out to eat (especially on a date) to enjoy themselves and feel good, and not just for the food. We don't want to feel rushed, although we definitely do understand that there might be other people wanting to eat after us. I didn't appreciate being told multiple times that we needed to order quickly; we all understand that restaurants on a Saturday night are busy. I didn't really notice a big rush of people waiting to sit down at our 2-seater as we left. I had already had to deal with having the streetcar I was on break down, and then having to walk from the Danforth to Queen in the cold. I had really hoped to have a great date and dinner, but ended up coming out of the restaurant very upset and shocked that a manager would talk to my date and myself the way he did!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Never disappoints! The tawouk is great and they have nice bellydancing on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Officially my favourite restaurant in the city!!!  Let's start with the food - food of the gods. Delicious menu, not too extensive but enough to warrant a few trips, you'll want too. Everything is delish and worth a try. I would recommend getting the 3 dips, a main and a side to split between 2 people. The dips are gigantic, you'll be nibbling at them the entire meal and they are drool-worthy. Any of the mains are fantastic, I like the chicken or the lamb the best.   Now, onto the next most important aspect of Tabule, the drinks. Every drink is amazing and worth a try. Best Mojito's in the city. The staff, which are fun and fantastic, can help make a recommendation for you.  FYI - Best to book your reservation on Saturday evening, they have a belly dancer who is awesome at 8:00. I have never seen someone move so fast with a sword balanced on their head. Bam!"}
{"text":"Never ate at their original Yonge-Davisville restaurant, but when Tabule set up shop 'round-corner-from-all-the-way-home here in the east end, I quickly made a note to eat there once it is open. Its presence has broken up the monotony of western/gwai lo cuisine dominating Riverside-land, this side of the Don.  Photos and description cannot accurately convey how stunning the insides is--it really is like something ripped out of an interior design magazine. Modern colour choices complementing Arabic geometric patterns, wood tones, and eclectic light fixtures transforms the space into a new Queen Street neighbourhood gem, and with the front windows wide open, it might make you feel like you are somewhere far away.  Walked in on a Sunday for lunch--was the first customer of the day, but the place filled up soon enough. Good thing all the tables are well-spaced out in this generously-sized location.  Started with a falafel salad, which was lovely. Nothing could bloody compare to the Kefta Banadura ($19, if I remember right), the skewered lamb pieces was grilled just right, going well with the sublime tomato garlic stew, which had me drooling with a great tomato paste texture and a rich sweet and warm taste. If I could have a dish with nothing but just the stew, yes please I would. Meals are on the uppity side, even compared to their original location.  I enjoyed the food here, and would be back if I could muster a few more friends to join me for a belly dancing show they have on Saturday nights. That would certainly be more interesting.  {TTC: any Queen streetcar to Saulter or Boulton. Tabule is right next door to that lineup magnet Bonjour Brioche at the NW corner of Queen and DeGrassi. Do yourself a favour and follow a local's advice for once: skip that bloody lineup and eat here instead.}"}
{"text":"I am always pleased when I come to tabule. It's one of the best restaurants in toronto, hands down. The service is always pristine and the staff truly care about your dining experience. None of that \"were expensive, trendy, instagram famous garbage that toronto 'restaurants' love to flaunt)  All the dips are amazing  (labneh, babaganouj, hummus) although I wish they had better pita. I love their friend eggplant AND cauliflower. I've tried their mujaddara  (lentils are cooked perfectly)--It's so good.  Their grilled meats (lamb, chicken, kofteh) are always delicious (a but over salted) and are usually cooked perfectly. I've also had the eggplant veggie main, it's delicious.  I love the mahalbiah here. I also tried the kneffeh. It was good but different than the lebanese/Palestine version I know--more soft and custardy.   Thanks tabule for being a dining experience that never disapointed!"}
{"text":"I got the falafel entree for delivery with a side of grilled veg. Gluten free vegan for delivery through Foodora. The falafel was very good, fresh and still hot -- and gluten free, which is why I chose the restaurant. The mujaddara was ok, I mean you can't really screw up plain rice and lentils (but you apparently can charge a lot for them: $7.50 as a side). The \"concasse\" which comes on top was a fancy way of saying about 5 tiny pieces of tomato. The grilled veggies were good too -- done fresh, not sitting around. For the price, the portions were quite small though (except for the falafel), even with a side of veg. I weigh under 90 lbs and I'm not that full. There should've been more veg and more tahini sauce.  I like that they use mennonite raised chicken. I like that they have veggie and GF symbols next to their dishes, but a vegan symbol would also be useful.  Not bad, but not blow-your-mind. I'd eat it again, but unsure if I'd order it again with other choices available."}
{"text":"Definitely have very mixed feelings when the food is soo good but the service is sooo not.  I arrived at 6pm for my reservation for 4 people this evening. In addition to us at this time, there were two other parties of 2 inside the restaurant (4 in total). Our server took our order, repeated everything back to us before leaving - one steamwhistle to drink, and to eat: falafel salad, cauliflower, kefta, snapper and shrimp entrees to share.  By the time our salad came out, the beer still had not arrived as I watched the bar staff - they had clearly not gotten the order so I reminded our waiter of the drink. Halfway through our appetizer, we wanted a second beer and as our waiter walked by, we tried to grab his attention - my father tried to give a friendly and obvious call (because he is loud) but I felt it was ignored to the point that the manager on duty had to come address our request.  When we finished our salad, I thought that the cauliflower would be next, or that it would come with the entrees because it was a hot mezze...... that never made it to our table. The mains came and the food did not disappoint. Everything was flavourful, tickling all my tastebuds and the spreads gave variety with each bite. But the service was extremely disappointing despite the fact that the restaurant was 3 / 4 empty when we sat down for our meals.  We sat at the the front round table by the open window and a party of two was seated right beside us.  Every time the waiter (same for our table and theirs) went to assist them, he would always come in between our tables while there was no one seated to their other side. It was very distracting for my father as he had to move in every time, disrupting his meal and I'm not sure why this could have been easily avoided."}
{"text":"I have dined in but also live close enough that I am able to get Tabülè delivered and it's amazing! Food is consistently great. I recommend trying their house-made falafel and hummus. It's a no miss."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my co-workers. We arrived at around 20 to 12pm. The place wasn't packed, moderately busy Friday lunch time. The waitress took a while to come to our table to take orders. We ordered 2 mains and 2 appetizers. We waited for the food over 30 to 40 minuets. This is acceptable when the food is good but that wasn't the case.  Falafel was't bad, but they could serve more tahini. Their flat bread was very chewy, not much flavor to it. My co-worker and I shared kefta. How could anyone make ground meat dish so tough?! Meat tasted pretty good but it was so dry and chewy. I have made way better kefta myself! It was too pricy for what it is. This lunch was supposed to be a treat for myself but turned out to be a disappointment. I won't go back there for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My favourite restaurant in town! Always busy here but it's worth it make a reservation or wait. Try pick 3 appetizer to start. It's only beginning to wow your meal"}
{"text":"Had my Mom's b-day here in May booked the restaurant. The staff was friendly and the food was amazing the falafel is the best I have had.the shrimp was fantastic too as well as the twürk and beef"}
{"text":"Great staff. Excellent service. Went in by myself and didn't feel awkward at all. Had the roasted cauliflower, Lamb kabobs and a great syrah. Loved it all. Would go back again - with friends."}
{"text":"I love this place and every time I come here I'm a pathetic creature of habit because I can't get enough of my favourites I order the same thing almost every time.   Get the appetizer platter with all three of the dips - labni, hummus, and baba ganoush they are velvety smooth, flavourful, you-want-to-rub-them-all-over-yourself good - and they come with pretty much endless warmed white and whole wheat pita.  We get the fried eggplant, it's got a slightly crisp exterior with a warm soft centre and is drizzled with lemon juice which along with being delicious helps cut the oil in was fried in (note: it does not feel 'deep fried' nor is it oily).  For our main, we get the lamb kebab - medium rare, and it's always cooked to order and the rice and grilled veges that come along with it are good too.  The drinks are super good, 'Passion from Beirut' is how we had our first child - joking! But seriously their drinks are top notch.  Agree with every else on the service part, if you want said baby making drink you really have to flag down someone to get it. That said, dinner here will take time so if you're looking for a quick bite move along."}
{"text":"Just an amazing meal all around  I had the lamb/beef combo skewers, the wife went with the chicken skewers.  Moments after sinking my teeth into my meal i thought i had ordered the best dish in the place, but a few minutes later i had a small taste of hers and now i;m not so sure.  Both were excellent.  Service was attentive and overly friendly.  Decor was low key but very classy - this is a great place for a special occasion meal that could serve as a weekly haunt as well  Only snafu in the entire evening was the fly that kept buzzing around the table - eventually drowned in a drink (unintentionally) but after picking it out, he turned all Lazarus and flew away.  Strange."}
{"text":"Well, I stand corrected! I tried Tabule again but this time scoured Yelp for suggestions. It turns out you guys were right! The cauliflower was amazing - it's the must-order item on the menu. We also had the tabule, labni, kefta banadura, shrimp, and kunafta asha. While I wouldn't recommend the shrimp because I found it to be overcooked, the rest were good. I also fell in love with the kunafta asha. It was my first time trying this dessert and at first I had mixed feelings about it but with every bite I fell more and more in love! Mmmm.."}
{"text":"I really like Tabulé. I've been to the Davisville location multiple times but it was my first time to Queen St E. I might prefer the setup of this one, you can tell it is newer, The ambiance inside is great. The bar is close to diners, the tables are well set out and it feels cosy (but not crammed) because they are quite close together. The lighting is perfect. Our server was also great. He was very friendly and attentive without being pushy. We took some time to consider what to order and he didn't make us feel rushed but was always nearby.   We shared the three dip starter (hummus, labni and baba ganoush) and cauliflower as starters. The dips were are all delicious but the labni is the definite standout. The cauliflower is also tasty, I wouldn't have minded if the pieces were cut slightly larger though. I then ordered the haloum salad (sans falafel or other addition) and the hookah old fashioned and my friend got the falafel salad with chicken (plus a red wine and an old fashioned). Both my drink and main were tasty and I was well satiated with a box of leftovers to take home. My friend enjoyed her dishes as well.  I have read reviews that Tabulé is not as much bang for your buck as other middle eastern restaurants. However, in Toronto I struggled to think of a happy medium Lebanese? Mediterranean restaurant (moderate price, big portions) between Paramount's takeout place in Yorkville /shawarma and a restaurant such as Tabulé, District Oven or Byblos. Tabulé is probably more affordable than District Oven or Byblos (where you can seriously break the bank). The portions are a reasonable size for your average person and the food is very rich so I usually find I cannot finish it. One thing I will mention is that the wine here is a little pricey. If an 8oz red on the cheaper end of the menu is $15 I'd definitely shoot for a $10-$12 cocktail instead.  Other points to note:  - Great food consistency between Davisville and Queen St locations.  - If you're a vegetarian (or even if you're not) cheese is a definite star on the menu. - the staff are very genuine and friendly - everyone waved goodbye and thanked us for coming. It definitely gives the place a family feel."}
{"text":"I seriously do not have one bad thing to say about this place. Awesome owners, the price is completely reasonable and the food is authentic and tastes fantastic. The decor is chic and overall a guaranteed great experience!"}
{"text":"It's mediocre.  Between four of us, we ordered the babaghanoush, fried eggplant, and cauliflower to share. The eggplant was great, but the babaghanoush wasn't anything special - I can make better at home. I was expecting a lot more. The cauliflower was nice, but could've been crispier.  Two of us shared the kefta with tomato garlic sauce and the kibbe. We weren't super hungry after the appetizers and filled up on the bread and pickles too, so just ordered one main and another appetizer.   The kefta was dry, not juicy at all. The spices were nice, but again, nothing to write home about. The kibbe was also dry and too overcooked.   We also ordered two cocktails - these were great.   If you want really good middle eastern cuisine, I'd recommend trying something else (so far, I've loved the Persian restaurants uptown)."}
{"text":"A food show on Netflix had given me a rare craving for middle Eastern cuisine. I'm not a Lebanese or Israeli food expert, but I've had it enough times to know I don't hate it nor love it. This restaurant in particular had always been recommended, but I've always put it off.. until now. Now I too, will be the one to recommend it and bring friends here!  As soon as you walk in, the welcoming decor of exposed tiles, large light fixtures, luxurious wooden wall fixtures/cabinets almost invites you into what feels like a big dinner party!   Cocktails: 5/5 $10-12 I got the Beirut Passion, which I loved! The ingredient are super fresh, and the drink itself was beautiful but simple. I can drink that by the gallon under a hot sun all day! We also tried the Old Fashioned Hookah, which was a nice smokey twist on the classic. Their entire cocktail list was interesting, and I will go back just for that.  App Sampler: 5/5 ($14.95) You get to pick 3 of 4 dips for your pitas. I chose the hummus, babaganuj, and labni. Hummus was creamy, babaganuj was very smokey and flavourful, and my first labni was better than anticipated. The pita was warm and soft. Excellent choice for a shared app!  Falafel: 4/5 ($6.75) I am not a fan of falafels as they tend to be dry and hard. But I've heard good things about these and wanted to try it. These 6 falafels are definitely the best that I've had in toronto- not hard, but crunchy exterior.  Not dry, but soft beany interior.  By this point, the restaurant has already won me over, and I couldn't wait for the entrees...  Lamb Shank special: 5/5 ($21.95) Giant braised Lamb falling off the bone served atop a bed of rice pilaf, with a side of grilled vegetables. It was a great portion, and probably one of the better lamb shanks I've ever had in restaurants. Only wished there were a bit more veg. *Bonus- if you dig into the bone of the lamb, there is BONE MARROW!!! Yes- rich, fatty, lamb-y, delicious bone marrow you can eat with rice or pita. SCORE!  Kefta Banadura: 4.5/5 ($18.95) Ground Lamb and beef grilled, then served in tomato sauce was perfectly cooked. I would personally prefer it to be more fatty, as I find all kefta usually a tad dry. The rice and veg is served on the side, and once again wished there was a tad more veg. Overall, an amazing portion.  Service: 5/5 (priceless) We received wonderful attentive service from beginning to end. It's been a while since I've had service carried out this well. The hostess was warm and welcoming, the server came by soon after we got settled to let us know of the special, the assistant followed up right away with a fancy pour of water. Drinks came in a timely matter, appetizers flew right out of the kitchen, quality checks done throughout the meal without being invasive. I also love that the manager comes by for a quick check! I do want to really point out that the service of the assistants are above the norm. They were present, warm, polite, offered to pack our food, smiles all around. Even as we were leaving, we received smiling thank yous from not only our server, but also the assistants, the managers, the OTHER servers, the bartender... THIS level of cohesiveness from beginning to end is not what you see everyday. Good job, Tabule Leslieville!   Don't wait like I did, just go! Unless you hate good food, enjoy cocktails from a carton, and prefer self-service."}
{"text":"Wife and I love this place.  We sit by the bar and drink, and nibble on some appetizers.  Very nice vibe to the place."}
{"text":"The food, the atmosphere, and the service are all impressive.  This place was recommended to me by a Lebanese friend so I tried it out and instantly fell in love (with the restaurant, not the friend). I come here regularly now.   The food. Where do I start? Take a look at the menu to get an idea. The appetizers are big enough to share (or eat alone until fullness). The meat is always tender. The falafels are always moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I sometimes daydream about the food.  The atmosphere is classy, chic, quaint, lively, jovial, etc. I never noticed the music in the background, but music does play. The sounds that are most noticeable to me are the voices of other people, the clanking of cutlery on plates, the sound of water being poured. It's a very stimulating environment. The lighting is somewhat dim, and the decor is beautiful. It gives off a nice vibe.  The service is excellent. I have multiple food allergies and they are very accommodating. Just let them know what your allergies are, ask about items on the menu, and they will do their best to accomodate.  My allergies are peanuts, eggs, shellfish, soy protein isolate, some tree nuts, and sesame seeds. Despite the long list of allergies, I can have most of what is on the menu. For those who have celiac's disease or who are gluten intolerant, many of the menu items are gluten free.   So if you want to try this place out, give them a call to make a reservation (they get really busy so reservation is your best guarantee to get a table). It could become your new favourite!"}
{"text":"We really liked the decor. We needed a serene, pretty place to relax with a cocktail.   We shared a lamb kebab plate and falafels. The falafels were not good. They were waaay too greasy and heavy. The lamb kebab was tender and tasty. However, the rice and grilled veggies were also swimming in grease. Bread was so-so. Overall, the food was meh.   However, for the service and the pretty decor, I would have liked to give it a higher rating."}
{"text":"Hot Food/Snot Service...  The place is busy, has a fun vibe. It is NOISY. On a Tuesday night, people across the table were practically screaming.  The waiter showed whenever he wasn't on a smoke break or perhaps he was watching his favorite TV show, dunno.  When the drinks did arrive, the Caesar was wonderfully mixed, perfect spice. Highly recommended. They have some decent wines (thank god, not just Canadian wines).   The chicken breast did come out hot, despite everyone's worries. The thing with this place, is that it's great if you want a night out with boisterous friends. Nothing romantic, nothing business, nothing of serious conversation because you won't be having it here.  The flatbread is terrific, the sauces are to die for, very fresh and lively. The bar is average.   Were it not for the noise and the terrible service that they seem somewhat proud of, I'd likely have given them a five-star rating."}
{"text":"Just leaving this beautiful restaurant that serves wonderful food with a sour taste in my mouth. This is my 4th visit and as much as I love the food, the service has been appalling every time. I almost said something to the manager on my way out but he was too busy at the hostess stand to even bother saying, \" thank you or good bye\".  The service staff don't seem very happy or pleasant and very inattentive. I know how important pleasant and thoughtful service is having a husband who works very hard at training the staff in his restaurants. Maybe I will just do take out from now on."}
{"text":"This place is quite good and fairly priced. I've been here a few times and both their apps and mains that I've had are delicious. They bring a nice pickled goodness assortment at the start too. The lamb / beef there is done really well with some very tasty spices and sauces. My only recommendation for improvement is a couple times the reso we had didn't get us a table right away hence a wait."}
{"text":"Very average food. Food took 40 minutes to come out, despite only three other tables being served in the restaurant. People are very nice. Atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant with delicious and fresh food, I frequent Tabule and dishes like the cauliflower, hummus with meat, labni and lamb dishes keep me coming back. They also serve up interesting and delicious cocktails. Great service and friendly staff, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A long time favourite - particularly lamb chops, grilled shrimp, eggplant entree, chicken livers and falafels!  I enjoy both locations but frequent the Yonge and Eglinton location more often, the Queen E. location has more of a lounge/cocktail bar vibe, but is still very good. I think they still have live dance performances on Thursdays or Fridays."}
{"text":"Best rice ever!!!!  Everything is always tasty and fresh. Drinks are STRONG. Definitely need a reso if your party is more than 2 people. But I've walked in for a table of 2 a few times and was sat right away. So happy it's in my neighborhood.   Hint: if they're busy and don't have a seat for you, their sister restaurant, Souk Tabule is nearby. It's a more casual version, but most dishes are very similar to Tabule."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal here. Admittedly I didn't eat too much, but I really enjoyed what I tried!  I came for a late lunch on a Saturday around 3 pm and there weren't too many people around. The inside area was completely empty, and their adorable outdoor patio was maybe half full. It was a gorgeous day out, so my group of 4 opted to sit outside.  I started with one of their mojito cocktails, the 'from beirut with passion' ($11). It has bacardi, malibu passion rum, fresh watermelon juice, passion fruit, lime mint, and sugar syrup. This was a super delicious and refreshing drink; I could barely taste the alcohol. Would highly recommend it if you like sweet cocktails like me.  I wasn't super hungry, so I just ate some of the shared apps instead of getting my own entree. The falafels ($7.50) here were amazing! I'm usually not a huge fan but they tasted extra fresh. An order comes with 6 pieces so it's great for sharing.  I also tried the homemade lentil soup ($6.50) and the arnabeet ($7.95), which is flash fried cauliflower. I've had daal (Indian lentil soup) plenty of times before, but the soup here uses red lentils and was very flavorful. I fell in love with this dish! The cauliflower was okay but tasted like they had been out of the fryer for a while.  To be honest, middle eastern food isn't anywhere near the top of my favorite cuisines to eat, but if they all tasted this good, I would definitely have to reconsider that..."}
{"text":"The food was great and our hostess was soo sweet. It was though my first time to take my folks there and they came out of town. Unfortunately one of the waitress was very rude with my dad which was totally unacceptable. I didnt say anything as i didnt want to ruin the atmosphere but she was extremely rude. What a disappointing experience and was so bothered that i took my folks there."}
{"text":"My friend told me that this is a good place for lamb. He was wrong it was amazing. I ordered a plate of lamb shish kabob was fantastic. Im a very picky eater for meats especially lamb. Appetizers were so so, nothing special."}
{"text":"Tabule was amazing. The appetizers, drinks, and mains I tried were all perfection. I didn't try any desserts because I gorged myself on everything else. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of the food. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Cute space, nice staff, and middle eastern food... you can't go wrong.  I had the kefta banadura and I thought it was delicious. It's skewered ground lamb and beef chunks, pile in a tomato garlic sauce. I think the extra few dollars for the garlic-y tomato sauce is worth it if you are a saucy kind of person, which I am. You can also just get the kefta without the sauce. The rice and veggies come in a separate dish so you can choose to eat it separate or add it into the sauce.  My wife had the sampler platter and chose the Labni, Babaganuj and Tabule. She also opted for the Laffa bread instead of Pita. The dips were good, and the laffa bread though it was thinner than what she was used to. She also had the mint limeade fresh juice which she enjoyed quite a bit.  All and all it was a good meal and time. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends with a 6 month baby. We were greeted by 3 different servers when we arrived to check in on us. The space was not too busy but it felt quite loud due to a group of ladies sitting besides our table :) I wasn't particularly impressed with my margarita. We ordered 2 different appetizer platters for the entire table. Everyone loved the hummus with pine nuts, baba ganoush and labni served alongside warm pita bread. Another favorite was the roasted cauliflower which we ordered again. Only once did they make the mistake of serving cold burnt pita bread which we returned while we were waiting for freshly baked ones to arrive. The mains met with mixed reviews although I personally quite enjoyed the grilled chicken and falafel entree. Please note that the portions are quite huge so eat responsibly :) One of our friends was celebrating her birthday, so they got a dessert with a candle in the end which was a special touch. The service was quite friendly and attentive at all times. Definitely a good spot for a small group of friends or family to hang out."}
{"text":"Tabule is amazing.  Authentic, simple and delicious food. Can I tell you about the withdrawal pains I get when I go without their homemade Babaghanouj for too long? Or the roasted eggplant? Their drinks are lovely too - everything from their fresh-squeezed juices of the day, to their staple offerings, to their rotating mixed drinks. This is authentic and amazing food that even the \"Ehhh, I don't like Middle Eastern\" will fall for. Combine that with a lovely space and atmosphere and you've found yourself a staple."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews and passing the restaurant more than once with intrigue, I decided to give Tabule a try on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The restaurant was relatively empty, with only 4 other tables occupied at the time, which should have been my first warning sign. However, the decor and modern ambiance was more than inviting as was the menu.  The waitress eventually greeted us and decided to sit us at the rear of the restaurant near the kitchen door, despite the myriad of tables available. This was apparently convenient for her to fill her station. Besides the kitchen noise, we were also treated to the staff stocking and cleaning during the course of service.  The less than attentive waitress eventually took a drink order. The fruit juice concoctions were wonderful, especially the strawberry-basil juice. However, this was not enough to sustain a memorable meal.  The server eventually took the rest of our order with the comment of \"you have been here before and don't need me to explain anything right?\". We had not been there before and this comment was a clear indication that she was in a hurry to get back to her conversation at the bar with fellow staffers.  The meal started with hallüm salad -  baby arugula, onions & seared hallüm cheese tossed together in a pomegranate dressing. It consisted of lots and lots of arugala, almost no onions and four pieces of seared cheese. The pomegranate dressing was mostly oil and the hint of pomegranate was almost unnoticeable. Still it was refreshing to the palate, but not much to write home about.  Next came the falafel plate with six fried balls of crushed chick peas, split fava, parsley, garlic, onions and spices fried and served with tahini in a plastic container. Overall the flavor and spices were well balanced. However, these crunchy balls with soft delicate insides had their true flavor completely masked by the taste of old oil and a slight overcooked char.  The last plate consisted of their fried eggplant - slices of eggplant fried and topped with a lemon garlic dressing. Clearly the eggplant had not been drained before serving and was sitting in a pool of its own oil. The garlic was more than heavy handed and the lemon was no where to be found. This dish could not be finished and what I did manage to eat remained with me for the balance of the day.  After much starring, we manage to get the server's attention to request a check and after several trips back and forth the bill was actually paid. With not so much as a \"was everything alright\", \"thank you\" or \"come again\", we exited the restaurant. In fairness the bartender and the one server who had stocked wine bottles all during our lunch did thank us.  Overall, this restaurant has the potential to be so much more than it is, but the key is in the details. Both service and food are in much need of improvement before I would consider returning."}
{"text":"I can't think of any situation where I want to stare into the navel of a stranger while drinking a Negroni and dipping pita into the best yogurt cheese -- let alone all dips -- so coming on a Friday instead of Saturday belly dancing night was more appealing. And, really, we went at our first chance after getting a very kind gift card.   We may have arrived just minutes after opening, and were the first ones to arrive, sometimes that's a bit of a bore for me because I really love the energy of a packed, impressive restaurant, and lo, over the course of the next 90 minutes it filled.   I'm a lucky guy -- yet again -- to be friends with people who know what they're doing when they're spending money on eating & drinking & sitting in spaces. This was one of the finest meals of 2013, maybe my favourite.   Sometimes I feel really bad about letting the server that we may want to take our time and have drinks for a little bit before ordering entrees, but she was really sweet and hopefully she saw the future of perfect lamb entrees our eyes.   They do a whacky Negroni with rhum in it. What! Yeah, it's really smart, in fact. Campari being bitter, the sweetness balanced it incredibly well, I was really, really impressed, and they added a spiced bitter.   Now. The dips. The DIPS. All caps worthy. Tattoo on my hands worthy. Never drink without these dips worthy. That yogurt cheese thing.   The lamb is cooked to a crusty edge, sealed in flavours, and it's large enough to share. The ambience is warm, not too loud but the energy is up, and the service is spot on.   I don't think there's another accent they could write on their name to accentuate how perfect of a dining establishment they are."}
{"text":"This place is heaven for dips and all things cheesy. Came with a friend for lunch after work today and everything I ate was delicious. We got the dip sampler which allows you to choose three from the four choices of tabbouleh, labni, hummus, and baba ghanoush. We went for the first three and the labni, a really creamy cheese-yogurt dip was by far our favourite. I think I could've eaten it all day. Least favourite was ironically Tabülè's namesake, which is not so much a dip, but a salad-like mixture that's mainly seasoned chopped parsley. If you've ever had a shawarma plate with that sharp and bright tasting side of greens, it is that exactly.   Next up was the grilled halloumi (think of feta, but firmer)  salad with falafels added.  Super bomb, and the next table was definitely envious because they had ordered just the falafels and had to ask the waiter what we were eating. One huge thing to look out for is that this salad is under appetizers and was served with the dips instead of the main we intended it to be. As a result, the lamb skewers, my friend's dish, was brought out much much later. By that time, I was too stuffed even take a taste, but my friend reports it was well cooked and flavourful. Tabülè is also really good about packing up leftovers, which for us was basically a whole entrée. They don't make you feel self-conscious about it at all, which is a nice perk if you over order like we did.   Lunch and dinner seem to have the same menu, so to give my fellow yelpers a ballpark: a shared app, two mains and a drink apiece will run you about $95 after tax and a good tip. So worth it, and there's such an awesome upscale-casual vibe with tons of natural lighting in the day and unique fixtures for evening. We didn't need reservations for 1ish on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, but by 3pm, they were starting to ask walk-ins if they had booked a table.   Last shout out as this review is starting to ramble - trust me, and get the kumquat mojito, just do it!"}
{"text":"I had a lunch date here recently, and we were both super impressed. My meal, the falafel entree, was very good, and my date liked her market fish. The house red wine was good too, but I just found out that you can BYOB! The Wine Rack is just down the street...think about it, people.   My server was just lovely. She suggested the hummous as a starter and that was good advice. Best hummus ever.   The decor is also quite beautiful.   I'd like to give this place 4.5 stars. I thought it was a little pricey for lunch, but you'll bring your own wine and avoid that."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have had middle eastern food and when I was told that's where we are going I was looking forward to it.  When I walked in, I noticed that none of the clientele was middle eastern.  This immediately raised my spidey sense, the same feeling when I walk into a Mandarin.  Setting was nice to sit and chat and service was great but that's about it.  Food was terrible.  Main dishes either came with really dry chicken or really dry ground beef.  Then rice, and roasted veggies.  Super uninteresting.  Our table shared a salad, I forgot which one it was but it was so salty.  Salad is a dish that comes with the most fluids but you find yourself craving for water after you eat that salad.  So yes, never again.  A friend brought me here, gonna have to rethink this friendship."}
{"text":"Excellent food. As someone suffering on a diet, there was lots to choose from at Tablue. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and you have to try the Beirut Sangria. It is fantastic. My sole complaint would be that the music was a touch loud during the belly dancer's performance. Other than that, we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"i've been about four times. my first visit was mind-blowing. the next two times were amazing. the last time was okay and i haven't been back for few months.   i love the hummus here. it's smooth, well-seasoned with just the right amount of acidity. it pairs well with their falafels, which are light and tasty.   i also really like their hallum salad. it's just a really solid dish. it's simple, but everything goes well together. the lentil soup comes highly recommended and it is indeed an excellent soup.  the dish that put me off from going again was the kefta. it was dry. no amount of high-quality ingredients and flavorings can save a dry meatball. i should've said something, but i didn't. i plan to go back soon and give it another shot. i'll update my review then.  the service is generally friendly. the décor is really nice. the place is open and bright."}
{"text":"I like and recommend this Middle Eastern restaurant with modern yet cosy decor. Recently I was in the area and decided to revisit it with my wife. It was as memorable as I remembered from the first visit. Their appetiser options are great and authentic. Lamb dishes are incredible, and of course you have to have their tabbouleh."}
{"text":"Over the bridge and into Riverdale to Tabülè we go :-) this Middle Eastern joint takes pride in representing the Lebanese Cuisine. The ambiance is OH so Romantic with tea light candles burning softly in glass holders...  Upon arriving I was served their medley of peppers and pickles displayed in a clay pot...I was also entertained by their pouring water in the glass \"technique,\" if you've been here you know exactly what I am talking about ;-)  I ordered from their 'Hot' entrées  their Labneh  yogurt dish which is served with side of pita and falafel balls with a humus Dip. They both were excellent. For my main I had the beef skewers with brown rice and grilled vegetables, which was a bit on the salty side but was also tasty and not bland...   I finished it off with a Moroccan Mint tea which came with one of the Thieves from Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves! Order the tea and see it for yourself :-D"}
{"text":"Dynamite!  Incredible and well priced Middle Eastern food.  Great location on Queen St E in Riverside/Leslieville.  If you like hummus, I think this is best in city.  Get it with the sautéed lamb added to it.  It will blow you away!  Though I've tried many of the dishes which are great, I always come back to the Tawuk ( chicken skewers ).  Always cooked perfectly.  No corkage fees on Mondays and Tuesdays makes it a great early week date night."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious every time. One of the most consistent restaurants I have ever been to. With delivery, take-out and dine-in options you can eat Tabule any time, any day and anywhere. The staff is amazing, and despite being able to eat it everywhere, I will forever want to end up eating at the bar in the Queen E location for the people alone."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner for four at the Queen East location. We had a lovely time! The place was obviously busy but the server gave us the perfect amount of attention. The food was deliciously savoury and full of flavour. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Actual rating 4.5  I wasn't sure if I should review this place considering they've just been open a couple days.  I figured maybe it was too early in the game to get a clear picture of what's going on here.    I am happy to say that their game IS on and Tabule on Queen is ready to go!  Day of, I managed to score reservations for the exact time I wanted.  And I am glad I made reservations because as I sat there enjoying my dinner, I saw a number of people come in and try to score table to no avail.  The place was jumping!  Let's start with the atmosphere.  The place is really well put together and looks very sharp.  I especially appreciated the unique lighting fixtures. The seats were comfortable and although the tables were close, I didn't feel like I was eating in a stranger's lap.  We started with the sampler platter for a starter and it was very good.  The flat bread was piping hot and the hummus, labni, and tabule were all generous in portion and tasty!  As a main, I ordered the tawuk.  I really loved the flavorful rice and the grilled veggies and the chicken was well seasoned too. My only critique would be I really think this dish could have benefited from a sauce of some sort.  The chicken wasn't dry, but it would have been elevated with a dip.  The service we received was prompt and the staff were personable.  I can honestly say I enjoyed my entire time here.  I look forward to coming back and trying more dishes on this menu...especially when there is a belly dancing show!!!  Totally recommend."}
{"text":"I am a fat man, and I cook. Trust me, this place is excellent.  We ordered the nibeh, tabobuleh and babaganoush and it was unusually oustanding as were the main entrees. I'm not sure about the mediocre reviews personally. I'm hard to please when it comes to food and I was impressed they got everything just right.  I cook middle eastern and frequent middle eastern places and I was quite impressed. The service was also much more friendly (yet non invasive) than I am used to having eaten a lot in SF, LA, NYC, Houston and Toronto.  It also has a nice vibe. I will be coming back here. Often."}
{"text":"My friend treated me to Tabule (Riverside location) for my birthday. It's her favourite Middle Eastern restaurant in Toronto and she always raves about it. Since I've never been to any of Tabule's locations (the other ones are in Midtown and Bayview), I was up to see why my friend loves it so much.  We both started off the meal with From Beirut with Passion. This is a great cocktail for fans of sweet and fruity drinks. We decided to share a couple of appetizers. The Sampler Platter is perfect if you want to try three of the four Mezze Cold dishes. If you go for a full size dish, it might be a bit heavy on the stomach if you decide on something like Hummus or Babaganuj. Between my friend and I, the two appetizers and one entree each was quite filling. One appetizer is enough to share between two people since your main dish would be quite big.   I was not wowed by my experience but I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. They have big windows so during the day it's lovely to have lunch there. The Tabule Riverside location is also perfect for families in the area that are craving some Middle Eastern food in a nice sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT. Amazing food, decor and service.   Sample plate with hummus, babaG and labni was amazing and huge. Falafa was spot on and the lamb/beef in tomato sauce was great. Huge portions.   Classy but casual. Great time!"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 rating... better than average but it has some little things that didnt push it to a 4 star.  After hearing many good things and reading numerous awards given to Tabule on their food, I finally grabbed a reservation on a Saturday to hopefully enjoy their back patio.  Well, mother nature has her own mind and it rained us out but we still were able to enjoy some really good food.  Over in Leslieville, Tabule was clearly a popular spot as every table had a reserved sign on it and people were constantly being turned away.    We were quickly greeted and welcomed to our table.  The room is nicely done and doesn't scream the traditional kitchsy design of palm trees, tajines, or peaked arches.  It's a lovely space with dark walnuts, clean modern lighting, and pops of colour.  Our tables were close to the other ones but I can see how popular this place was that they need to pack it in.    Service here is warm, friendly, and very quick.  After ordering drinks, only a few minutes later it showed up at our table.  After ordering, our mezze appetizer appeared in less than 5 minutes.  It's all quick here!  The atmosphere and service is a clear 4 star but the food is where it started to falter.  The appetizers were a clear 4 star but the mains was clearly underseasoned and flavoured but they were well cooked.    Sampler platter of Hummus, Tabule, and baba ganoush - This arrived with freshly warmed pitas and ohhh this was good.  Bright and bold tabule was fresh with a hit of lemon and nice chunks of tomato and chick peas.  The hummus was very creamy with a healthy dose of garline and the baba ganoush was the best.  Perfect balance of lemon, garlic, and tahini with the creamy egg plant.  It was a nice touch that they refilled it unprompted  Lentil soup - If you love soup get this!  Oh this was full on flavour and so creamy!  This is very good.  I remember just wanting to horde this to myself.  Lovely flavours of garlic, cumin, and onions.    Falafel Salad as an entree - Though this is in the appetizer section, this could easily double as a main if you get the appetizers.  It comes with perfect crunchy falafel and a generous amount of a simple salad.  I've read Tabule Falafel are great and I do agree their well cooked... not dripping in oil but it had a good crunchy exterior with a moist interior.  What made me not enjoy it as much was that it was missing all the seasoning and spices.  It needed salt and I didnt taste the cumin, garlic, parsley... nothing.  It was a very plain chickpea flavour.  Thankfully we had some hot sauce to save it.  Lamb skewers - Another generous dish ... rice was enough to feed two people and it came with some roasted vegetables.  The lamb had a light gamey flavour in a good way and it was very well cooked.  Just perfectly medium and still very tender.  The only concern was that there was no seasoning... no salt, no pepper.  It was very plain in flavour.  Overall, it is a good restaurant with some great appetizer but their mains just need some flavour to kick it up and be a 4 star."}
{"text":"A friend of mind and I walked in super hungry looking to a place to catch up on life. Im new to the city. I feel like this is a great discovery in my book and that I am not done exploring their delicious menu. To the dude who complained about flavors and dried meat...I find it very hard to believe.  Extremely friendly welcome. Efficient service and amazing dishes. We had the stuffed homemade grape leaves (served with yogourt sauce),Spicy beef sausages (very tender and moist), roasted cauliflower (delicious sauce) and egg plant dish (fine crisp outer layer and cooked to perfection inside). With a nice glass of wine. The place has a good vibe. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is good price is a little on the expensive side but the seating is great! Nice place for middle eastern fine dining."}
{"text":"This place offers a more refined version of Mediterranean food.  Everything is very tasty and fresh.  I do have a few reservations:  You don't always get a big bang for your buck (especially on the protein.)  Plus, the place can be a bit crammed during dinner time on the weekend."}
{"text":"LOVED the hummus today and warm bread. Good coffee Amazing grilled chicken rice and veggies! Awesome array of accompanying sauces offered-- garlic, yogurt, hot and tahini samples.  Really impressed. Also a beautiful renovation ! I Will be back for cocktails and of course more FOOD!"}
{"text":"Although the ambiance was wonderful and the service polite and prompt, the food was very underwhelming.  We ordered the baba ghanoush, fried cauliflower, falafel, and the lamb skewers. The baba ghanoush had a nice texture and char flavour. The cauliflower wasn't crispy at all and bland. The falafels were the best part - very crispy with a soft but not dry center. Lamb was chewy and I cant even remember the sides served with it they were so forgetful.   The pita that came with the meal was delicious, we asked for a second basket since our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and ended up taking it home.   At the end of the day it was OK but not great, the prices were a bit steep. Maybe other menu items are a better."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. We chose this place based on reviews and that it was a few steps away from the apartment we rented. We dropped in at around 7:30pm, without a reservation, shortly after we arrived in Toronto. The restaurant was quite full, but they managed to make some room for us at the end of the bar. I'm glad they did.  The food was superb. The falalels were the best I've had in a long time. Crispy yet fluffy and light. The akaawi cheese was tasty. The chicken livers were incredible -- my friend, a vegeterian for health reasons, couldn't resist the temptation. The complementary olives were fresh and soft. For the mains, we took the tawuk, which was well executed. The chicken was cooked perfectly, moist and not stringy. The kefta were perfected seasoned.  In terms of cocktails, the twists on the mojitos are pretty interesting. I took the kumquat mojito. The habanero lime syrup gave the mojito a welcome touch of heat. I liked it very much!  The service was perfect. I find that too often, sitting at the bar means getting a bad service as the person behind the bar is more focused on making drinks for the tables than taking care of people sitting there to eat. But it hasn't been the case at Tabule. Never had to ask for anything, she observed and anticipated our needs such as filling our glasses of water when they were almost empty. Even better, when I had finished my mojito, she offered to refill it with (free) club soda, allowing it to re-infuse with the mint and the kumquats. Awesome!  Overall, it was a perfect experience. Tabule is in my list to come back next time I visit the city."}
{"text":"Love the food here at Tabule, and it's a great atmosphere too!  Food and drink: My favourite dishes are the arnabeet (cauliflower with tahini), falafel and babaganuj (pureed eggplant). You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu though and there are tons of options for vegetarians. I generally find their cocktails very sweet for my liking, though delicious (the one with the spice helps balance it out, I believe it was called the kumquat though I can't remember for sure).  Atmosphere: Good balance between modern, authentic and down-to-earth - they've definitely nailed it at this location."}
{"text":"What an amazing evening!  The service was super friendly and efficient.  The cocktail menu was imaginative.  The food was outstanding.  My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary casually enjoying 6 appetizers.  The restaurant decor has sexy 70s elements to it.  We're going to start celebrating our anniversary weekly!"}
{"text":"This is a review for their catering/delivery service only.  I've eaten many times at both locations and find the food excellent, and very authentic (I lived in the Middle East for several years).  Which is why I've used them to cater parties.  But my recent experience makes me think twice before doing it again.  I specifically asked for a delivery time that would not have me accepting platters of food and juggling a credit card machine at the same time as my guests arrived.  But the food was 35 minutes late and so hugs at the doorway (for my guests, not the delivery guy) competed with all the food trays and bags and payment. I told the guy this was precisely what I wanted to avoid, and he shrugged and said he was given a different time by the restaurant (which is only 12 minutes away).  Then he stood there and practically demanded a tip. I had already paid and had no cash within reach, and my guests were wondering about coats, and where to put presents, and it was a madhouse.  But he wouldn't leave until I gave him the credit card again and we put through a tip for him.  The food was just as I ordered and wonderful, with the exception of not nearly enough fried eggplant for 28 people (I ordered a fixed meal for my number of guests), and we were really missing the olives, pickles, and pickled turnips, which add so much, and which I expected would come with the food since it's on the table gratis in the restaurant.  The fact that there was enough pita to feed the block didn't make up for no pickles.   The day after, I wrote a note to the restaurant with my gentle feedback, nothing harsh, just letting them know what bothered me.  Never got a reply.  This is too bad because I would have continued to use them for parties, and now I'll think again. There are so many places for good food in Toronto that service takes on even more importance. If Tabule shores up this aspect of their operation, they'll get 5 stars from all their reviewers.  Meantime, I'll just eat in the restaurant, and leave the catering to a place that tries harder."}
{"text":"I love this place. The ambience, the staff and most of all, the food! I've been here a few times now and the experience is consistently good as are all the dishes I've tried. Try the labni, baba ghanoush, cauliflower, tomatoes, lamb chops, and kababs. Desserts are also great - not too sweet - and the cardamom Lebanese coffee."}
{"text":"M and I came here before heading out to a birthday party.  After taking a look at the patio he decided to eat dinner out on the patio. It was such a great choice! The patio was so nice and airy. The inside was really nice but since it was such a beautiful evening we went outside. We ordered the trio sample platter, as well as a side of fried eggplant. Holy!! Everything was so good. The flavour were amazing! We were both thoroughly Impressed with everything!  The service was a bit slow, but honestly the place was packed and it was nice to have alone time with M! I would come back to this location in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Have been several times and never disappoints! Food is excellent! Popped in after work with no reservation and they have always been gracious and tried to seat us. Definitely need reservations on a weekend! Great atmosphere, great food!"}
{"text":"After far too many below average meals here in Toronto, we finally had a good experience at Tabule today!  Ambiance is great, the restaurant seems new and is decorated nicely, and it's super clean.   Service is fantastic. Our server was super friendly and talkative and gave us great suggestions.  Food is great: -- Halloumi salad - I can't eat cheese but everyone raved about this. -- Hummus, Taboule, Labne, Baba Ghanoush - Taboule was very fresh and tasty, I didn't eat the other items but they were all well received. -- Pita bread - I didn't love this. It was a bit bland and too crispy. -- Spicy shrimp - excellent. I totally recommend this dish. -- Chicken shish was well received by my husband and daughter. I tasted the rice and it was great. -- Other members of our party had lamb and beef, I didn't try these.  Overall: I'd definitely return to this restaurant. Prices were reasonable and the food and service were great. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"So in love with this place  the lamb and chicken skewers with the Labni app are amazing! The Kunafa is a phenomenal dessert too"}
{"text":"Lingering Over Dips will be the name of my memoir, if my life unfolds the way I'm planning. Tabule is a lovely new Leslieville locale, helping to make my dreams come true.   I started my night with Scent Of A Rose, a perfectly fragrant rose and gin martini and the trio of dips: hummus, baba ghanoush and a yogurt cheese one whose name escapes me. I then moved on to falafel and a lamb dinner, cooked exactly to my specifications.   The ambiance is home-chic. The Toronto usual: fun lighting hanging above wooden booths and tables. The place gets bustling around 8pm, so be sure to make a reservation, so that your dreams may also come true.   PEPPER POINTS for a reasonably priced wine list."}
{"text":"If you get a chance, definitely visit this restaurant.  Their selection of unique cocktails and the appetizers (baba ganoush, tabouli, Labni and an assortment of pickled treats) were a great start to our evening.   When our mains arrived (I had the kefta banadura which was truly delightufl!), everyone around the table spoke to the quality and flavours of their dinner.  The only two small things that were not the best was the slow service (a girl out for a night should never have an empty glass!) and the fact that the restaurant itself has a very high noise factor.  It's not a place where one can easily talk to friends they haven't seen for months without practically yelling at one another.  While I was happy to see them busy on a Tuesday night, I was somewhat disappointed that we weren't able to better communicate because of the buzz in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved it here. The ambiance, the service, the food and the cocktails.  I ordered babaganush, tabule, beef kefta in a garlic tomato sauce with garlic paste and raw onions and an amazing kumquat cocktail. Everything was perfectly done. Absolutely delicious.  And that cocktail was.....wow. Worth traveling to the east end for!  We just dined another location tonight too so I'm adding to this review. Even better than my first experience. They have wheat free pitas that are incredible. I tried the labni  (yogurt/cheese dip) and falafel. INCREDIBLE. I'm in awe. If I could give 6 stars I would!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a while and I'm so finally glad that I did. My friends and I came in around 9:30PM and were seated promptly as it wasn't very busy. My friends and I got the sample platter of three dips which were the hummus, babaganüj (eggplant spread), and the labni (a Lebanese yogurt cheese). These dips came with white and whole wheat pita bread. They were so good, especially the hummus.  My one friend and I shared the kefta banadura which was two skewers of ground mixed lamb and beef in a tomato garlic sauce and let me tell you this was everything I needed in that moment. The flavour was on point and the skewers cooked perfectly.  I love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
