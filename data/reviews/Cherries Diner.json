{"text":"This is a really basic place with a fairly large menu.  They serve breakfast, burgers and sandwiches, and I think most people could find something to eat on the menu.  I ordered the cheese steak and it was very good. And just so cheesesteak purists know, it came with your choice of cheese (rather than cheese whiz), with peppers, onions, and mushrooms, on a crusty sandwich bun. 
 Our waitress was exceptonally rude. I actually thought it was quite fun. One of the people I was with asked for mayonaisse and she threw the packets onto the table, scattering them all over my place.  She also discouraged questions about the menu, and I thought she was going to lose it at one point, though there was only one other table during lunch time on a Friday. They have a lunch special that offers your choice of an entree with a drink and fries for $6.00.  I asked for no fries, so the waitress charged me $0.50 extra, presumably since it wasn't *really* the special.  Instead of questioning the logic behind this, I took the $0.50 out of her tip. 
At the end of our meal, the cook (and maybe the owner?) came over to say hello and to thank us for coming in, which was nice of him, though he kept looking down my shirt.  So maybe it wasn't so nice of him. Another plus is that they serve both Coke and Pepsi products.  There really is something for everyone here, and I'd probably go again for breakfast. In a turtle neck. And only if I was in a decent mood."}
{"text":"Ok...not great.

I might have a Jersey diner bias but this place was just OK. Especially for the price it was just OK. I will say that the service was good but again the quality of the food was just OK. You get the point."}
{"text":"I'm usually a generous reviewer, but this place was beyond gross. They clearly had a roof leak, and there was an overpowering musty smell. The whole place was both a fire and health code violation. I sat at the counter and could see right into the kitchen - one of the chefs dropped a pancake flipper on the floor, and I could tell he was going to pick it right back up and use it again, but he saw me looking and he put it in the sink. Some places are well worn and have character. Cherries should come with a free tetanus shot."}
{"text":"The prices here are low, but maybe for a reason. The food was fine, really - what you would expect from a breakfast diner - but we had a few minor problems that cropped up as well. For example, when I called in advance to see if they had both breakfast and lunch I received a very abrupt reply and they hung up before I had finished asking questions. One of our diners ordered a sandwich that didn't say it had cheese but did come with it, which was fine but unexpected. Other than the few hiccups it would have been a four-star as the service was quick and pleasant once we arrived."}
{"text":"Worst service and food. An embarrassment to the city, made worse by being in market square. They messed our order twice, and tried to overcharge on the bill. Would you believe when we asked for a tea and coffee, the tea bag was put in cold water, in a mug. The water had all sorts of floaties in it. IHOP or Denny's would be better options, for market square. Hopefully Marcus Lemonis can be called, to fix this restaurant, the way he did for the Simple Greek at the other end of Market Square."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast - Saturday morning super diner - small place - but delicious food - great local spot!"}
{"text":"Ok first off lets start with it is a diner, a greasy spoon joint so you have to go into this knowing that or you may not like it.   Customer service ...sub par but that's ok as that is my expectation of a diner.   The food is awesome though!  I go on Fridays for Chicken Biryani because its amazeballs!  I've been for breakfast a few times and its always good (Disclaimer: I don't eat eggs, beef, or pork).   It's moving soon and I can't wait to try out the new place."}
{"text":"Was visiting Pittsburgh to bring my daughter as an incoming freshman to Duquesne University. Was staying at the Wyndham Grand downtown and all I wanted was a traditional diner breakfast. Found Cherries at Market Square and I got excited. Went in there and all the employees were sitting down watching tv. Lady came over to me to take my order but sounded like a high efficiency robot. Came off extremely rude the way she was in such a hurry. She looked at me crazy when I said I wanted my bacon deep fried. Where I'm from (south central PA) this is common to get bacon truly crispy. Anyway, I got the special for $6.99. 2 eggs, homefries, bacon, and 1 pc of French toast. Everything was prepared ok but the potatoes. They were chunky, soggy, and greasy, probably were sitting awhile. Stuff was not made to order but the eggs...I waited like 5 min. for my entire order. Maybe I'm spoiled. I grew up on diner food because my mom was a server. This diner was not anything I was used to. Not to mention, where I live, you can get 2 eggs, homefries, and toast for $1.99. So a breakfast like this would be far less. But still not a bad price for downtown Pittsburgh, just overall, not entirely pleased. That's why just 2 stars..."}
{"text":"I love this place Except they need Real plates! Fried eggs off of styrofoam just doesn't get er done. Bring cash as plastic is a no go..."}
{"text":"Good basic breakfast diner.  No thrills. Eggs and meats all overdone unless you ask otherwise. No butter."}
{"text":"It's like any old place that has good food lol if your from Pittsburgh you know how much we love our old places that are hidden, packed and really old. Old chairs and and tables service is not always the best but everyone is friendly and seems to know one another kind of reminds me the neighborhood stop. Love it bacon is awesome !!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and prices were amazing, but this one waitress was absolutely horrendous and rude. She made the atmosphere of the place unpleasant. I did not like her attitude whatsoever and other customers did not appreciate it either. At 10am, having a rude waitress is the last thing someone would want. 
When I asked her how the restaurant made their grits, she said \"I don't know what you want me to tell you, they're grits.\" I rephrased the question instead asking \"what are the grits like?\" and still she answered \"if you've never had them before I wouldn't recommend trying them now,\"while rolling her eyes and sighing at me. If the waitress was not rude and full of attitude, the experience would have been perfect. I really thought that the waitress was racist because she was really rude to me and other people of color in the restaurant, but I noticed she was very patient and kind to my white friends sitting at the table. My friends didn't hesitate to point it out either. 
Then, later in the meal our table heard her and another customer having a fight. The customer at said table was an overweight man, and as the fight ended, the waitress walked away and said loudly (for the whole restaurant to hear) \"at least I can run.\" 
I really hope management changes things to make the environment more pleasant for customers."}
{"text":"March 2018:
The food is decent, but the lady who picks up the phone.... my God, she must have the most miserable life ever! Forgive me for calling to ask if you still offer something on the menu and how much it costs! Cherries is known to have a biryani special on Fridays, so I wanted to come check it out.... and called to ask if it was still being available. The very rude lady who answered the call didn't hold back her heavy sigh and disinterested tone when she told me \"UGHHHH yeah its here but I'm closing in 15 minutes\". Then I asked how much it was , with another \"Ughhh $8 something\". Needless to say, I did not end up going because they clearly don't need the business. The couple times I've eaten breakfast there, the server didn't do as much as smile. Not exactly the type of \"customer service\" you would expect from a small business. I should have read the reviews before going there, as many state the server's obnoxiously rude behavior.


Updated review- June 2018:
Racial profiling at its best. I came in, for biryani attempt #2 after many months. Lady mentioned in above review was on the phone, she looked at me and said \"how many\". So she could basically judge what I wanted based on my skin color. Pretty sure if a Caucasian person came in, she wouldn't assume they want bacon and eggs? Rude. At least have the decency to ask a customer what they want rather than assume. Learn some manners, lady with the short brown hair. Your business increases ten-fold because of an ethnic cuisine offering on Fridays so the least you can do is try to be a little respectful by not being presumptuous. Who manages this place? The saving grace is that the biryani is actually pretty good. 4 stars for the biryani and 0 for customer service."}
{"text":"One of the five worst breakfasts I have ever been served.   An omelette, dry and salted past the point of palatable.    Flavorless pancakes.   On the other hand, the service is awful.   Terrible, rude waitress.   Sorry to have disturbed her.   Couldn't get my check, so I dropped more cash than I needed to just to escape from this icky, sticky hovel.   If there was no other place open for breakfast, I'd wait for lunch.   Be afraid.  Be very afraid."}
{"text":"I work downtown, and this place is my oasis.  The Kitchen Sink omelet is a massive 3 egg beast that contains peppers, onion, cheese, hash browns, and your choice of meat.  The pro move is to eat this around 11 am to satisfy breakfast and lunch needs.  Also, every Friday the Pakistani cooks make authentic biryani.  Prepare yourself to reach a new level of enlightenment and to cease being productive for the rest of the work day. 

The only reason this gem doesn't get 5 stars is the poor, dated interior.  The coffee is some gross Folgers bs.  Little known fact, Folgers and diners were better in the 70's."}
{"text":"Ate there with wife, 2 sons and friends and about 1.5 hours later our 2.5 year old son, who had pancakes complained of a hurting belly.  About 10 minutes later he vomited up his pancakes.  We asked a friend who also had the pancakes and found out she was ill as well.  Called Cherries and after speaking with 3 people got nowhere.  10 minutes later a fourth person from Cherries called and after explaining again what was going on was yelled at for not telling them sooner.  Do not eat there."}
{"text":"It wasn't that long ago that I was walking through my beloved Market Square with a co-worker early in the morning when the smell of bacon came wafting gently to my nose. It was a faint smell- so faint, in fact, that I barely recognized and indeed said to my co-worker \"you know what they need in Market Square? You know what would make this THE downtown Mecca or food? An all-American, good old, greasy spoon diner.\"

\"Have you been to Cherries?\" Inquired the co-worker.

\"Alas... I've not. What is that place? And more importantly... do they serve bacon?\"

Cherries is the perfect little hole-in-the-wall greasy plate, get your day started right kind of a place. Everything about this place is near-perfect: The coffee is good, the forks are cheap, there is a small counter, and a TV playing the Today Show that no one is really watching, and the staff is three old people, who are constantly bickering and fighting. I once heard the waitress (the one one in there) say to another customer \"you can order that if you want, but it'll take a long time. He [i'm assuming the cook] hates making that and he is already in a terrible mood.\" It was at this point that the cook poked his head out of the kitchen and yelled sometime indeterminate and the waitress said \"see? So what else do you want.\"

I'm not giving this 5 stars because the food is good, but not AMAZING... but then again, it isn't supposed to be! Also the coffee comes in a styrofoam cup, not a mug and it can get crowded in the small space. Be sure to carve out an hour for breakfast... it may not take that long, but it certainly is a possibility."}
{"text":"You had me at \"breakfast all day.\" Why more establishments don't serve breakfast all day is beyond me. Anyone who knows me or reads my Yelp reviews knows that breakfast is my favorite meal, to the extent that - if I miss breakfast my whole day is thrown off. Well, it was one of those days. I had such a busy morning at work that I never ate. I checked with Yelp to see if there was anywhere nearby that serves breakfast all day because it was only a Friday. Usually restaurants will be more lax about their breakfast hours on weekends. It was in my good fortune that Cherrie's Diner served breakfast. I was able to walk right in. Be prepared for everybody to call you \"darling\" and \"honey.\" I sat down at a table in the back. They tried to sit me closer to the door at first but it was too cold and they also had a fan going on the ceiling. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on rye. It was simple, cheap, and delicious. It came out in about 10 minutes and I was out of there in about a half hour. I also enjoyed a black coffee. The coffee was nothing short of diner coffee. You can definitely skip that part. All the breakfast items that they were bringing out looked delicious. There were a lot of people getting take out as well. I would go back, because I always just respect a place that respects breakfast."}
{"text":"Don't eat here and then you won't have to worry. The food NEVER came and the lady serving me was so rude it just made it worse. Even the other customers commented about her attitude."}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh for the Steelers game and we went to this place for breakfast.  I liked the eggs and potatoes with sausage and pancakes.  The service was fast.  I would come here again next time in Pittsburgh.  Now I'm going back to California where it's warm."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had. The server was extremely rude and fighting with the kitchen staff. They chose to be open for the marathon and every time someone walked in the door the server would push them away by saying how long the wait was going to be when it wasn't busy at all. Will never go there again"}
{"text":"Classic breakfast-lunch joint. Avoid the brand-name commercial places and frequent a locally-owned diner, or they'll soon be gone. You don't come here fro some high-toned meal -- this is your stop for eggs and bacon, or a burger and fries. Ate here with a friend before an afternoon Bucs game -- you're just minutes away from PNC Park. The food is what you'd expect -- and that means hot and mighty fresh. All made to order, not not precooked like you's find at other places. Great service with no pretensions! Over-easy eggs, sausage, real home fries, pancakes -- all for about $8. Coffee was good, too. I tell ya, I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's a classic diner and doesn't pretend to be anything else.  Breakfast places seem to hard to find these days.  Scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and tea were served as ordered for $6.  If you want to pay three times as much for the same meal, visit one of the local hotels!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by asking what's the deal with Pittsburgh and not having a lot of breakfast places? Now onto the review. We were starving looking for a decent breakfast and not wanting to overpay for the hotel buffet, so we sought out Cherries. The reviews on here reflect the diner much more then the ones on Yelp, so don't pass this place up. It's strictly no frills, but it's what to expect of a diner. The food is good, cheap, and quick. We went on a particularly busy morning when there was a convention going on in town and the places was packed to capacity the entire time we were there. Get the early bird and fuel up for the day."}
{"text":"When it comes to Cherries Diner, in my opinion, there is some good and there is some bad.

The good: Breakfast all day.  The menu (including breakfast and lunch options) is pretty impressive for such a small place.  I ordered the egg sandwich which was prepared like a grilled cheese sandwich - buttered and grilled on both sides as opposed to just the egg, cheese and meat put in a bagel or two pieces of toast.  It made for a pretty tasty sandwich.

The bad:  Service was a bit lacking.  Not that I really needed a whole lot other than my food, but still.  It would have been nice if someone had just asked if I needed anything shortly after I got my food.  However, they charge for water.  Sure, it's only 25 cents, but when you're charging me over $8 for a simple egg sandwich and fries, I don't see how they justify charging for water.  You better believe that I took that styrofoam cup filled with ice with me.  I paid for it, after all.  

I've noted that others mentioned Cherries does not take credit cards.  Well that is no longer the case.  

I didn't have a bad overall experience there and I certainly struggled between 2 or 3 stars.  But the bottom line is I really enjoyed the sandwich, and that outweighed the bad in my opinion."}
{"text":"Cherries has the potential to be a decent diner in Market Square, but they don't quite deliver. I stopped here for a late breakfast and grabbed a stool at the counter. The place was packed, which isn't saying much when the max capacity is like 30.

Anyway, it took awhile to order, even just to get a cup of coffee. It seemed like they had enough staff, but what they were all doing, I'm not sure. So I finally got my over-easy eggs (yolks already broken), bacon (crunch, crunch) and potatoes (eh). Oh, the toast was good. I was so hungry, I didn't even care at that point.

So, I finished the meal and waited, waited, waited for my check. Thankfully, it was fairly inexpensive. I was happy to pay and leave quickly to find a real cup of coffee somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time in downtown Pitt and just wanted your basic diner breakfast.   Service was good, food was good, price not so good.   Ordered ham and cheese omelette, potatoes, toast and coffee.   Just beware, not everything is included.  English muffin is extra, potatoes are extra.   If you really want breakfast in the afternoon, it'll do.   Not the best value."}
{"text":"Great cheap food for when you're in a morning rush! I would recommend the early bird special it's eggs meat potatoes  and a choice of 1 pancake or toast all around 7 dollars you can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"When your lookin for a great breakfast cheep in the heart of dahn tahn Pittsburgh, right by market square... you have to stop on in to Cherries Dinner.. It's a great atmosphere.. A little ol dinner with bar type seating a 8 or so tables/booths..         

One very nice waitress runs her little tush off to keep her patrons happy.. With coffee or the instant water you get upon sittin dahn..

Always go for breakfast, so I don't really know how their lunch is, I bet if I had to guess pretty good since the breakfast always hits the spot.. I always get the kitchen sink which includes a three egg omelette peppers, onions, your choice of meat: bacon,or ham home fries in the omelette, or on the side, cheese and a choice of wheat, rye, or white toast..(pic provided) 

Better believe every time I'm workin in tahn or in walkin distance of market square I'll be there.."}
{"text":"I am not so sure where all this negativity is coming from for this place.  I'm in love with it.  It's gritty, it's cramped, it's greasy and it's everything I imagine a diner to be when placed in a downtown area.  In fact, I think that's what gives this place it's charm.

When you think diner, you picture one that they depict in movies or television shows.  One where the wait staff is quick with their wit, maybe a bit sarcastic too.  One where you want to smell the grease from the cooking in the back.  And even though Cherries doesn't have the typical diner look on the inside, it has a very unique look to define itself.

When I walked in here, it was after the morning rush.  It was dieing down inside and it made for pretty quick service for me.  The waitress I got greeted me with a 'I'm late for my cigarette break' look, and a voice to match.  The order was sent to the back and I paid promptly after wards and just sat at the counter and waited.  While I waited, I thought the price I paid was a bit steep for the item I ordered.  I had ordered a breakfast sandwich and nothing more.  What I got was one huge honking sandwich.  It's was the equivalent of two or three breakfast sandwiches at any other place in the area.  When I pulled the sandwich out of the bag and it was wrapped in it's aluminum foil glory.  I truly did feel like I was on a movie set diner.  The toast was perfectly toasted.  The eggs were cooked to griddle perfection and the sausage patty was by far one of the best I have ever had.

It should be noted, that like most small eateries and restaurants in the downtown area, they have a 3 o'clock closing time.  So you do need to be in the downtown area fairly early to enjoy this place.  Credit cards are accepted.

And this, my friends, makes my 400th review!"}
{"text":"In town for a bachelor party.  Told to check out Cherries by the hotel folks. Arrive. Busy - line, but not to bad.  Go to sit. Tables only seat 4, we have 5 guys.  Grab a 5th chair.  Promptly told by staff, \"can't have a chair in the aisle, fire hazard.\"  They offered no solution. A couple nice ladies from St Louis invited me to sit with them while my buddies sat together. Their meal had wrapped up. But, we got to talking and had a nice convo. The sole waitress in the place brought me a place setting and then proceeded to wait on my buddies having forgotten/opted to ignore me. I tried to flag her down several times as she zipped about serving other tables. Left after 10 minutes without having been offered coffee/water. 

I would say \"awful service\" but I received none. 40 minutes wasted. Staff at Dunkin Donuts next door were friendly and the food and coffee was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday morning with my husband and one year old.  They were understandably busy.  Got seated in timely manner but could not get waited on.  Multiple Customers that sat down after us were waited on before and got skipped twice. I know this a small  place but ownership should either be more attentive to their customers or hire another waiter.  I'm sure this isn't the first time they were busy on a Saturday morning. Decided to go to Kellyo's , they were busy also but were waited on within 2 minutes."}
{"text":"It should be noted that they do take credit cards now.

Cherries is a no-frills diner. The staff are very... Pittsburghese. Polite but not overly cheery. The decor and layout are simply done. There's a TV in the corner of the restaurant. In short, Cherries doesn't try to be anything fancy and it succeeds at its simplicity.

I come in here for breakfast from time to time and it doesn't disappoint nor hugely impress. Good omelettes, lots of bacons. Sometimes I get a pancake. And you can get pretty much what you want for under $10."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel nearby and wanted breakfast so I walked through market square in the rain and stopped at this diner. Ordered the breakfast sandwich with regular sausage. I tried ordering a fruit bowl but the lady behind the counter shut me down quickly with \"we don't have any fresh fruits here.\"
The sandwich was absolutely delicious. The white bread was toasted nice and crispy and it was so buttery. The eggs were fried perfectly. With the salty and savory sausage and the super melted american cheese holding everything together, it was possibly one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.
I mean, they did have pancakes with strawberries, bluberries or cherries. I'm still not sure why they couldn't give me a bowl or a cup of fruits...
Anyhow, the breakfast sandwich made it all worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place. They serve a special lunch \"chicken biryani\" for 8$. It so delicious, and the staff are really nice."}
{"text":"For as many times as I've been in the downtown Pittsburgh and Market Square areas, I did not know this place existed until a group of friends came here for lunch following the St. Paddy's Day Parade.

It's a cozy greasy spoon type place with some very reasonably priced breakfast and lunch items. I ordered the loaded French toast, which included two slices of Italian bread with cream cheese and strawberries, for $6.

I have no idea how long this place has been here, but it seems pretty cool to have a cute lil diner in the middle of downtown. Service was good."}
{"text":"I came to Cherries Diner for lunch. I got the pancakes, eggs, and bacon. The food was good enough. The staff were friendly and I got my food in a reasonable amount of time. I'd say everything was going okay until I found a hair on my plate. That's a BIG no-no!! The cooks in the back were not wearing hair nets, which they should probably consider doing in the future. If it wasn't for the hair, I'd probably go back for lunch every now and again because its cheap and half decent."}
{"text":"Typical diner fare, rapid hot coffee refills. Food slower than anticipated but definitely tasty!"}
{"text":"I almost feel bad leaving a one star review because it's really nothing against the food, but I've really never had such terrible service in my life. I've been here twice, thinking the first time that it was just a bad day for the waitress. But the second time was even worse. She is extremely rude, got into it with someone over a window problem(??) while I was there, and I just did not feel welcome at all. For the second time. There won't be a third time."}
{"text":"Did not expect to encounter such rudeness outside my hometown of NYC. My mere presence seemed to offend the waitress: as I am a friendly and polite person I can't imagine why. Others seemed ok. Just a warning: coffee is extra: (not so in NYC). Home fries were extra too..."}
{"text":"There don't seem to be a lot of places to get breakfast in downtown Pittsburgh. It was nice to stumble on diner-esque Cherries. Big, cheap breakfast. Typical diner waitress friendliness with a proper \"don't give me crap\" attitude. They mixed up our egg order. The sausage is a bit salty (maybe it's a regional thing). All 'n' all, a welcome find."}
{"text":"An awesome place to burn an entire Saturday morning. The place is tiny, yet the staff has a tough time getting food to your table in under an hour. 

The French toast had an overwhelming taste of onions as it was most likely cooked on or next to the gyro on the next table. The English muffins are flown in upon order from England...that is, I assume such since it didn't make its appearance until I was paying the check. The soup was blah...I never really got to taste it because it defied the 2nd law of thermodynamics as it never chilled.

Anyone who is familiar with logistics will sure to suffer a major anxiety and/or panic attack. The disorganization is beyond anything seen since computers were invented."}
{"text":"I was in town for a work conference and needed a diner that had a basic, good breakfast, and was referred to this place by the front desk staff. The reviews were a little mixed, so I was initially skeptical, but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised with the food and my overall experience. 

First off, it's a diner, not a five star restaurant. You come in, seat yourself, and someone will be with you. If you're expecting to be doted on and given the cloth napkin treatment then this place isn't for you. The menu was pretty expansive and everything very reasonably priced. I ordered an egg white omelette. It came with toast, but I didn't eat that. The omelette was very good, not overcooked, and a nice amount of toppings (a little heavy on the cheese but that was okay). 

I will be going back for breakfast, as it seems you can't get a reasonably priced and hearty breakfast anywhere else in the downtown area. I took off a star because of the lack of ventilation. You walk in and immediately smell the food cooking. I was worried that I'd go to my conference smelling like fried bacon. They're moving across market square, so maybe the new restaurant will fix this issue."}
{"text":"Cherries Diner is a classic diner downtown on the market square which harkens back to all of the B-reel diner scenes you have ever seen in films.  This no frills joint offers solid breakfast and lunch fare at a reasonable price. The coffee was really good and the waitress kept it coming.  Speaking of the waitress, she was my favorite part of the dining experience.  She was rough around the edges, never smiled, but wasn't rude.  No time for chit-chat, but made sure you wanted for nothing.  She came across like she might actually smack you if you got out of line; I got the feeling she's done this before.  She was great...:)

The smaller than usual, to the point menu offered the standard diner fare. I went with the kitchen sink omelet made with onions, green peppers, ham and cheese served with honest-to-God home fries and your choice of toast.  The home fries were fried crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with the jagged and almost burnt edges...perfection. The omelet is made with the ingredients cooked into the egg as opposed to the egg surrounding them; not my preferred style but still a solid omelet.  

The lower prices draws a little more of a sketchy crowd, but it just added to the classic ambiance of what you might think of for a hometown diner.  

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's not fancy and ultra cool modern like the things around it.  But the service was quick and friendly. My early bird special was just how I like my eggs and bacon. The potatoes weren't greasy and seasoned well. My pancakes were very good. After trying to eat at some high rated little micro coffee shop and having slow service and they didn't have the food on the menu, this place hit the spot."}
{"text":"We were fortunate to be able to grab a table for 5 of us for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  We opted to try something with cherries on it (pancake with cherries) but really, there wasn't anything particularly special about the cherries.  It just taked like the cherry pie preserves from a jar.

Otherwise, food was just fine.  Sausage links were odd in the sense that they were skinny.  A decently priced ($6-7 per meal) breakfast option in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Especially for breakfast. Service was friendly and fast. The early bird special was plenty of food for the money, $9 including tax."}
{"text":"Expensive for a small, barebones place.  Waitress gruff; no charm here."}
{"text":"It's cheap and it doesn't seem to be trying to be anything special.  I ordered the \"cherry bomb pancakes.\"  What could have been an amazing dish was compromised by Cool Whip instead of real whipped cream, and canned cherries in a thick corn syrup glaze rather than fresh cherries.  The pancakes themselves were great.  Admittedly the whole thing was delicious, but I tend to go for higher quality ingredients in my food.  The service wasn't great, either."}
{"text":"This place is called Cherries Diner and only has the pie filling cherries. Same goes for the strawberries and other fruits. Not many options on food either and the area didn't have a clean feel to it. I looked in the back room and saw mass loads of grease. I hope they clean it up and serve better food at their soon to be new location.

My meal was edible that's the only reason they get two stars."}
{"text":"I came hungry and left full.  My wife and I both ordered omelettes and they were decent sized and tasted good.  They sell bottles of OJ and pop, and the service was good.  They kept my coffee full and fresh.  Small place, but not bad for breakfast."}
{"text":"Cane here for a late lunch with friends; probably about 1.5 hours before they closed. The food was good and I had a BLT and the got Chicken Clubs. However, our server was extra grumpy which kind of made the experience a little unsettling. However, I would go again for breakfast foods."}
{"text":"Felt that the main server was racist.  Very rude and gave us a tone while she was friendly and inviting toward other guests, who weren't asian. 

Food is greasy and lacking in flavor.  Pancake was soggy and lacked any form of flavor.  No amount of syrup would save it.  

Sausage had an off putting taste.  I can't pinpoint the cause of it. 

The only saving grace is the easy over eggs and home fries, which doesn't mean much.  

Overall,combination of mediocre food and racist treatment from waiter (person who seemed like the owner) makes this a place I would never recommend or return to."}
{"text":"Seems like one of the only spots to grab breakfast downtown aside from a chain. Good egg/meat platters (home fries were bomb!!) and awesome pancakes. No frills, no complaints, good value."}
{"text":"Fine if you're willing to wait for over half an hour for your food and fifteen minutes to wait in line just to pay. This diner decided it was a great idea to create a takeout line that snakes through the restaurant itself and then only take orders from the takeout customers while completely ignoring the dine-in customers. Ultimately one of the cooks had to take my group's order. He came back twice for clarification on orders when none of us had even made substitutions. All in all just absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"I come here for chicken biryani on Fridays (only available one day a week). Is this the best biryani? No, but it is the only quick takeout biryani in downtown Pittsburgh at a very reasonable price. I'm sure Cherry's Diner would make more money selling Biryani full time, but heh what do I know. 

Can't comment on the diner food quality."}
{"text":"This place located just off of Market Square in Pittsburgh, should be featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. For a small joint tucked into the corner of the Square and not much to look at from the outside, they deliver an awesome breakfast plate that's easy on the wallet. Food and service are awesome and they always refill your coffee and offer it to go as you finish your meal. Don't over look this as an option if you are a traveler in Pittsburgh based on the appearance. Great food!"}
{"text":"We were a little wary with the three-star rating but one of the valets at our hotel recommended this place and we decided to give it a shot.  It's a little small and dingy and the lady that was working was a little gruff but the food was great!  My son said it was the best pancake he'd ever had.  I also loved my French toast."}
{"text":"Five star?? Hell no! Five star for diner?? Hell yes!!  Tiny little place. But big on greasy simple bacon and egg and sugary fruit filling goodness that will fill you up and make you smile! Service fast, competent, brusque, temperamental - total authentic diner ambience!  My Kitchen Sink omelette hit the spot-- all so good, filled with meat, veggie, potato perfection with touch of cheese!! My sons fruit stuffed French toast was a meal for three- very rich and tasty! My wife got a breakfast sandwich- very eggy, meaty and filling! Coffee high quality canned - not amazing, but drinkable and wakes you up!! People watching and dive atmosphere gives this an extra star atop well done basic greatly spoon fare that very few get right!"}
{"text":"Originally I was going to try a burger at Wingharts in Market Square for lunch today but when I got there it was closed with a sign on the door that read,  \"Temporarily Closed Due To Fire\". Still hankering for a burger,  I looked around and decided to give Cherries Diner a try. 

Cherries is all that you would expect from a \"diner\" in appearance,  atmosphere and service; It has that \"50's\" nostilogic speak and I was greeted promptly and cheerfully. I decided to go with the Cheeseburger Bacon Combo Special (comes with fries and a can of pop). My burger came in less then ten minutes.  

Everything seemed great and I was enjoying the whole experience. I wanted to give this place a great review but the burger was nothing to rave about. There was nothing terribly wrong with it mind you, but it was simply bland; the burger, the lettuce, the tomato and the bun where all virtually tasteless.   Even the bacon lacked flavor. A Mickey Dee's quarter pounder has more flavor than the burger I had... It's hard to image how they do that! 

I really wanted to like this place and I still want to like this place.  I plan on going back sometime soon just to try something else (maybe the chicken steak or the grilled sausage or the fish or maybe even breakfast) and maybe boost the rating.  I'm giving it a generous 3 stars simply because the service deserves it."}

I've passed this place a bunch of times whilst Downtown. Today I had to bus it, and considering it hadn't been reviewed yet, I thought I'd give it a try. 

Today was another first for me. 

I'll give ya a hint. I ate them as opposed to kissing them. 

Eh, so much for hidden 80's TV references. I had grits!

\"Please sir may I have some more.\"

Nah not really. 

Gru-uuu-el. 

I was in \"Oliver!\" in junior high. Sorry.

My father always told me that grits reminded him of Cream of Wheat, and he was right to think that. Butter and salt didn't help. They were just bland. Hopefully this is just a bad example of the suvvern staple, but I saw them on the menu and had to go for it y'know?

Considering that there was so much I wanted to try, I ate big.

So I also got a Kitchen Sink Omelet. 3 eggs, peppers, homefries, American Cheese, and bacon (all within the omelet itself), with white toast, and it was damn fine. It's been a while since I had an omelet that good. 

Now for my \"dessert.\" Hey, pancakes are dessert to me ok?

I thought the name \"Cherries\" referred to a woman's name. 

Nope, these people have a cherry fetish, which is preferable to having an errr... shoe fetish, infinitely better. 

Anyway, they unleashed The Cherry Bomb Pancake! It's like a crepe, but long and  fat, stuffed with cherries and topped with whipped cream. 

This is why I consider pancakes dessert. It almost tasted like a shortcake. What a reward. 

And get this, after all I ordered, which included a water and an OJ, my bill was 13 bucks and change.  The omelet was $6, the pancake $4, and I would have been satisfied with just one or the other; this place is a non-profit! 

If you need a good, quick breakfast on the cheap, ignore McDonald's and come here for some home cookin'.  And they serve burgers and lots of different sandwiches too, even wings, so go for lunch also. There's no excuse for fast food."}
{"text":"Its a \"greasy spoon\" diner w/ quality service and satisfying breakfast items. Down home staff in a small space makes you realize they're cooking your meal right after you order vs. simply dishing out 10 orders at a time. When you arrive, grab a seat anywhere, order some coffee, eavesdrop on others convoys, fill up on a great variety of omelettes/grits/toast/pancakes etc. and go home to take a nap or walk it off in da burgh!"}
{"text":"The food was good and very inexpensive. I had the kitchen sink omelette with coffee for less than $9. 

The waitress was attentive but a little surly.  I could hear her constantly complaining about  life."}
{"text":"I am always looking for a dining treasure and this is certainly one. It doesn't look like much on the inside - no polished interior and fireplace, but it has those little spots that tell you that some ordinary person put a lot of energy and love into making a little restaurant out of an imperfect space. Lots of people were packing in to eat breakfast. You can watch your meal being cooked and hear the stirring and sizzling. It's reassuring that breakfast didn't come from the freezer. And it's good - real delicious good food. I would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Sat and waited 20 minutes without being served so much as a cup of coffee, while the waitress berated a customer on the phone.  I finally just walked out.  Don't waste your time at this place. Instead, go someplace where your business is appreciated."}
{"text":"Epitome of a greasy spoon.
Seat yourself. 
Counter and table seating.
Small space.
Big portions at cheap prices. Shared the Early Bird special with my daughter.
Portions and prices are terrific. The food, not so much.
Our special included a pancake, two scrambled eggs, home-fries and two pieces of sausage.
Everything tastes exactly the same, like grease. So if you're into hefty portions of grease at a small price this is the establishment for you."}
