{"text":"good mix of queers - gay guys, gay girls, trans guys, trans girls, bi folks, everyone was cool w/each other. went to dance w friends, no lineup, no cover, it was a really warm thurs night & got hot inside cuz it's tiny but had excellent fun all the same. great music (nik red), good drink prices, great crowd, really welcoming to the whole queer community. had fun, gonna go back again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite bars in the west end. Unpretentious, with a cozy feel like you're drinking in a friends kitchen. Be sure to check out the eclectic jukebox and Saturday Sunday brunch.  Oh yeah, and it's cheap!  $5 highballs $5 pints $4 bottles"}
{"text":"I only went there once at night, just for drinks and music (dance).   There is a line up to get into this place, We thought it was jus to give it a hype, but the reality is that  is a very small musty place.  Is an Odyssey to go to the bathroom.  We couldn't dance and had to leave cuz a crazy b thought I was too close to her partner (you have to go through the dance floor in order to get to the bathroom) the crazy b was drunk and looked barely old enough to be there ...   Despite the good rating about the food, I wasnt impress with the place and not sure i will go back."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you probably would pass by without a second glance but if you do find yourself in the area - go in! It's quaint and fun. There's a love DJ sometimes playing some fun classics and the people you run in to are friendly. Not to mention if you ever wondered what it felt like to be inside a newspaper then don't forget to use the washroom before you leave!"}
{"text":"i automatically liked the Hen House when i heard that it was owned by members of the Organ. i knew it had to be cool.  despite that i may get a few evil eyes from hipsters here, i always feel pretty comfortable walking in at any time. once the hipsters get drunk enough they'll even try to dance with you.   the juke box is a great way to hang out with a new date, and there's great stuff in there to keep you coming back for more. the decor isn't much to speak of but the washrooms are papered in old high school year books, which always makes me take so much longer in there than i mean to. and there's a cute bench outside the washroom if you're waiting in line.  they're accommodating of the vegans. once we ordered nachos half without cheese and that wasn't a problem. caesars made with tomato juice or worcestershire are possible too.  brunch on weekends is good if you're just looking for a simple meal. i've only had the tofu scramble (i think that's the only vegan thing) and it's acceptable, though i wouldn't go there just for it. more due to the proximity to my house and that they'll serve cheap alcohol with it."}
{"text":"This place came highly recomended by a friend. I went in alone expecting a welcoming, comfortable space where I could sit quiety and drink a yummy draft beer. Instead I found a slightly musty space, a bartender who appeared put out that she needed to pause her conversation to serve me, and slightly flat cameron's (a perfectly respectable quaf) on draft. I've lived in the neighbourhood over a year, and despite really wanting to like this place, haven't returned, so I suppose I wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"My favorite lesbo bar to have brunch at.  The interior looks like a middle class kitchen from the 1950s and for $10 you can get some delicious pancakes, curry spiced hash-browns, a meat, scrambled eggs, and a little fruit. There's a jukebox, too.  Cash only.  Caesars are a solid 7/10."}
{"text":"I once ate a lentil walnut sandwich at the Hen House that was so good I went home and tried to replicate it myself (to no avail). The decor is ho-hum but inviting, the atmosphere is super casual and despite that it's not advertised anywhere; this is a queer friendly destination for those in the know."}
{"text":"I'm from Paris and I went with my girlfriend there. The music was great and the public which reminds me les amours imaginaires was also top. The place to be!"}
{"text":"i haven't had the food yet but i've had a few refreshing beverages here.  the jukebox has a great selection. i've been in here when it's been ram packed and when a tumbleweed might've blown past. it's pique is probably on the weekend. i'd stay away from the cameron's on tap though. i didn't feel too hot after drinking it and i wasn't the only one feeling that way."}
{"text":"I might just become a regular!   I have been a couple times and always thoroughly enjoy myself. As far as the atmosphere - it was cozy, just crowded enough, and everyone there was super friendly. I struck up conversations with strangers (which I almost never do) and anytime someone bumped into me, they apologized profusely (that almost never happens to me in Toronto).   Drinks are cheap by Toronto standards and the juke box has a good eclectic mix (Patti Smith, Erasure, Blondie, Sleater Kinney, CCR, the list goes on).   The decor is vintage and there is a coat rack near the front of the bar. It felt like hanging out in someone's very laidback apartment. And on top of all that, the crowd is mixed queer/straight with queer women/lesbians/lady-loving-ladies seemingly outnumbering the other demographics.    (Oh, and everyone was very easy on the eyes, which certainly never hurts)  I'm definitely going back again (and again)."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you almost don't want to share, so you can enjoy keeping it to yourself a little longer.  I had passed it on the streetcar several times and saw the hip crowd spilling out onto the street to smoke and chat - but, due to the sign, \"Cafe Dong Phuong\", I was confused and just thought it was a really cool neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant.  Who doesn't love a jukebox? And this one has one of the best selections in the city - rivaling even the Communists Daughter.  I also *loved* their washrooms. Wallpapered with yearbook pages from the sixties, it was amusing to read all the anachronistic career aspirations."}
{"text":"Tiny, crowded bar. Went with a friend on a Friday night looking to hang out and dance a bit. The crowd didn't seem very friendly - seemed very much like a neighbourhood bar where we just didn't know anyone. Drinks were okay - $6. The washrooms were neat but nothing here makes me very likely to go back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times with my girlfriend and they've been perfectly good, standard little breakfasts.  We didn't venture beyond standard brekkie fare (pancakes, B&E, etc), but what we got was nice.  As a breakfast joint, it's pushing ****, but I'll reserve a higher rating until I get the chance to try some of their other offerings.  I love the jukebox, staff is cool but not in a \"too cool for you\" kinda way.  Finally, yes, they're openly \"lesbo\" (re: gay/alt/whatever friendly), but we also brought my father here -- a pretty conservative, 60ish old dude from a small town who harbours some latent prejudices -- and he dug it.  So while they celebrate what some might call a stigma, they do it in a way that is neither tacky nor pushy.  Definitely recommended, might even become a favourite."}
{"text":"I had brunch here this past Sunday.  Everything was satisfactory, nothing stood out as particularly exciting or worthy of note.  List of things I had or tasted: scrambled eggs, omelet, pancake, bacon, and sausage.   Sentiment: there are better places in the city."}
{"text":"Like pancakes? I don't. But Karen's Pancakes at the Henhouse is phenomenal. I will not eat pancakes anywhere else except for the Henhouse. Karen's Pancakes comes with three pancakes, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, bacon or veggie bacon and fresh fruit ($10). I don't order anything else aside from this meal.   I will make ONE exception to my regular order...and that is if the Henhouse has their breakfast burrito special. The burrito is packed full of scrambled eggs, black beans, melted cheddar and topped with homemade salsa and slices of avocado. I like to add bacon inside the burrito as well. If the Henhouse has the burrito as a special, I always always order it.   Oh, and their nachos (which is only served at night) are excellent. The kitchen makes sure to layerrrrr the cheese, which is not usually done by other bars. You won't find me complaining about the amount of cheese on the nachos at the Henhouse because there is just so much (and I usually *love* to bitch about the stingy amount of cheese on nachos).  A friendly, laid-back neighbourhood brunching joint.  (Brunch is only served on Sundays. No more Saturday brunches!)"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say that the kitchen was closed (forever) last time I was there.   It's still a neat spot to go for drinks, but the food is what kept me coming back. They had great vegetarian options that were well done. Not gourmet, but worth the small prices they charge."}
{"text":"Where did this place come from?  One minute we're walking through the mile upon mile of Portuguese travel agencies and soccer-ball-themed sports bars that make up this stretch of Dundas.... and the next minute we're at this neat little spot.  Sure, they have almost nothing on tap....  but the hipsters come out in droves!   You can stand by the bar and watch the colorfully tattooed arms go up and down with every sip.   It's almost like makeshift animation.  Neat washrooms.  If you're reading this on an iPhone in the bar right now, go find out what I mean."}
