{"text":"Since moving to their new location in a business park about 2 miles from the old building this establishment has gone from one of my favorites to a restaurant that I don't think I will ever return to...  The old location while it was never known for its ambiance was still much better than the current location (a ground floor \"cafeteria\" of a medical office building).  My wife and I kept saying how it felt like a bad dream on our last visit.  The menu has been cut in half along with the portions while the prices have stayed the same or risen.  Some of the things that we loved about Ivan's were the fresh fries and the house made pickles, neither are offered anymore.  The matzo ball soup was the one highlight of our visit, as it was still the same great quality, but my corned beef was nowhere as good or generous of a portion as pre-relocation.  I am questioning why this restaurant moved in the first place, perhaps the new kitchen is more condusive to catering?  Maybe Ivan is planning on taking his business more in tthat direction, which I understand but I don't see this \"diner\" lasting too long based on what they have become.  I specifically created a Yelp account just to write this review and to warn people that this restaurant which I used to think was great is no longer the same and its saddens me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a famed Ivan's corn beef sandwich. As advertised - very good, priced fair, quick delivery. Good place for a quick bite. The dining area is very basic and clearly a mom-pop locally owned shop. I will return again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Had Ivan cater a military reunion for a group of WWll vets, outstanding food, promptness and value, service by a personable guy! Well done! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting and horribly overpriced. The flavor was bad. The chili was gross. Ended up throwing the food away, after wasting $20. The guy with cane is RUDE, I do not recommend this carter save your money,Yuck!"}
{"text":"Best Cornbeef In Akron , And I love The fish and chips ,, great place"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting and horribly overpriced. The bacon on the burger was nearly raw. The flavor was bad. The split pea and ham soup was gross. Ended up throwing the food away, after wasting $20. Yuck!"}
{"text":"The \"restaurant\" moved to Embassy Parkway.   The food is now way overpriced.  Portions are tiny, the soup is cold as are the \"hot\" sandwiches.  I attached a picture of the $4.95 chicken noodle soup.  Cheap noodles, salty broth, and no chicken or vegetables.  I could do a better job with bouillon cubes.  For two of us, we paid $29.60 for cokes, two soups, and two sandwiches with chips.  I've spent less and got more in Midtown Manhattan."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hot Dog Cart catering for our photo shoot. It was described as jumbo all beef vienna hot dogs. They were skinny and cheap. Burgers were not great quality either. Both packages were leaking all over when delivered. Not great quality for the price. Do NOT recommend."}
