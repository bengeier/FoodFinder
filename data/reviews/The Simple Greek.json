{"text":"Food isn't terrible but way overpriced. There are also much better gyro places in town."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I have been eating lunch at Simple Greek almost everyday since they opened. Not only do I think the food excellent, but it's only two minutes away from where I work and is extremely convenient for me. However, I must edit my original review because I have had too many disappointing experiences the last couple of weeks. 

First of all, Simple Greek's hours of operation are inconsistent. The sign on the door says they are open from 11am - 9pm everyday, however this has not been my experience. I have found on at least three occasions that they were closed during posted business hours.

Secondly, Simple Greek is consistently unprepared for their customers. Especially at lunchtime. I tend to go there during normal lunchtime hours, typically around 11:30 - 11:45am. Every time I visit they are always out of supplies and food! How is this possible right before lunchtime? The grilled chicken hasn't been prepared, or the gyro meat is still frozen, or there's no spicy hummus or they're out of paper towels in the often dirty restroom. They haven't had harissa since the first week they were open. And last week they were out of feta cheese for 5 days! A Greek restaurant with no feta? For 5 days?!?! Why not send someone to the supermarket?

Even if they do have the food stocked and ready for their lunch rush, they are still typically unprepared in other ways. There are no clean utensils to serve the food with, the tables are dirty, or the employees are not properly informed and trained - which causes delays and takes up precious time for working people on their lunch break. 

Lastly, the menu is very confusing. For a new casual restaurant like this to be successful it needs to be fresh, FAST and have a clear and easy to read menu. Remember, the community around you is unfamiliar with Simple Greek so it would be wise to make it as easy as possible to read the menu and navigate the ordering process. Take a clue from Chipotle, they are the king of this kind of fast casual food, and for good reason - their menu is full of pictures and is super easy to understand and they are super fast. 

I've seen it too many times already, a customer walks in, looks up at the crowded and hard to read menu and just stands there looking confused. An employee then has to take 10 mins explaining how it all works, what the options are, what kind of toppings are available, what's the difference between Greek yogurt and regular yogurt, what is spanikopita, etc., while a line of hungry customers stacks up impatiently behind them. We just want to order and pay as quickly as possible so that we may sit down and enjoy the good food. 

The bottom line is that the food is excellent, but there are a number of disappointing downfalls at the \"Not So\" Simple Greek that make it difficult for me to maintain my enthusiasm. I love the concept, and the staff is nice and friendly, I just wish the restaurant was better managed and a little more true to its name - Simple."}
{"text":"Staff is super nice & friendly!  Love the chicken gyro salad, fresh wonderful ingredients...the Greek salad dressing is amazing!  Restaurant is very clean and prices are reasonable.  Fantastic Greek food if you're on the go and need a delicious lunch or dinner!  And, a little Greek yogurt for dessert is my fav with honey and fruit!"}
{"text":"I thought this place had closed but saw that it re-opened under corporate management. I had a bowl filled with traditional gyros, chicken gyros, rice pilaf, village salad, tzatziki, feta, olives, and green beans. The flavors were authentic and the food was really good. The gyros was the good stuff, not the pre-sliced junk. I also had spanakopita and it was delicious. Light and flaky but still had the right amount of spinach/feta filling. The staff was friendly and pleasant. The only complaint that I have was the amount of meat that I was served. I thought the portion size was too small, but that could have been because the girl appeared to be in training."}
{"text":"Gross. The chicken was bland and super dry, the grape leaves tasted like dry cat food smells, and the whole expensive ($15) meal smells vaguely of fish. Can't even bring myself to take another bite, and I'm a pretty gracious person with food."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff!!!

I have been there twice.  Very fresh food.   You can choose rice, rice/lentils mix, or lentils as base for bowl. Chicken had excellent flavor.  There are 2 versions of green beans - both very tastey.  There is a variety of fresh topping - cucumbers, feta, olives, tomatoes,  onions, lettuce, etc.  Sauces/dressings available - I liked their signature sour cream one, although the yogurt one was good too.

I have tried both the side orders of vegetarian grape leaves and meat ones - both very good.

Think of it like a Greek version of Chipotle, but better.

Very filling and tasty.   The only reason I gave it 4 stars, street parking is limited. The parking garage is right  near by - and you can get 1 hr free validated parking.  It was just takes time to find parking/walk - weekdays especially lunch time during week and Saturdays.

Staff is 5 stars!!!!

They take credit cards and have take-out."}
{"text":"The Simple Greek was fantastic. My wife and I both tried original Gyro's and we told the cook to \"make it the way you'd eat it\" and everyone turned out wonderful. They had super customer service, quick turn-around and and top-notch flavor. They're definitely going to be a new regular on my list of weekend stops."}
{"text":"Although The Simple Greek offers a wide range of \"healthier\" options, it's sad to say that this store has certainly dropped down on the list of our local favorites. When it was \"My Big Fat Greek Gyro\" things were better. The food was fresher and the flavors were better. 

Now, it appears (and tastes)  as though the meats and fillings for your bowl or pita sit out all day. 
It's also a little more on the pricey side, which makes a disappointing trip even worse."}
{"text":"I really, really want to be able to give this place 4 or 5 stars. I am just so disappointed though. I love the gyro bowl with lentils and toppings: feta, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives etc. I love that it comes with warm pita and sauce.  Except, we never get the sauce or pita! We frequently get take out from here. I have learned to always check our order but sometimes when others pick up, they forget to check the order. There needs to be greater attention to detail.  

I think the food is great, when the details are there. There is a lot of inconsistency. Today, no pita, no extra sauce and the sauce that we did get (1 when we should have had 4) were not even filled halfway. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went in at 11:05 to try the new menu and the girl looked at us like why are you here and said they don't open till 11.  We told her it was after 11 and she said \"Oh than 20 more minutes\". How do you just randomly change your opening time. Not very organized obviously.  We really wanted to try their new menu but just left and went somewhere else.  Not very good customer service."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. On a Sunday evening when there is the arts festival, two sporting events and the gay pride events, the restaurant was immensely underprepared. When ordering, I asked for lentils as my protein but they were only a few left. The server substituted rice for the protein without asking. Both the rice and lentils were undercooked. Additionally, I ordered a spanakopita and was told they would bring it to me shortly. They never brought the spanakopita so I asked the server and was told they were out of spanakopita. There just didn't seem to be any communication between staff about what was on the menu or what needed to be refilled in the bar area."}
{"text":"Very good gyros and fries.  The place used to be called My Big Fat Greek Gyro. The food was hot and fresh.  With the summer months i hope they purchase local produce. Nothing better than fresh tomatoes."}
{"text":"We saw The Simple Greek on the tv show, The Profit, (Love Marcus) and decided to drive the 30 minutes and take the family.....we were so glad that we did.  When we arrived the restaurant was super busy and we thought it would take forever, not a chance...We were able to place our order quickly and being a newbie, the workers were very pleasant and helpful.  My 6 year old (picky eater) even loved it.  Bottom line...the food was awesome, place was super clean, the employees helpful, and the baklava was da bomb diggity.  It just melts right in your mouth!  We can't wait to go back!  P.S. Would love to hear the Greek Music!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today. 
Was delicious, simple, clean and easy. 
 Love that it's simple fresh ingredients.  Simple means easy to accommodate dietary restrictions!!  

Safe were young guys. It was slightly awkward ordering but they are nice friendly and gave us what we asked for."}
{"text":"If you like good healthy food on a budget, look no further. This place really taps my toe on every level."}
{"text":"Really bad. The gyro meat is sitting in a bin - not put on the flat top before serving the way it should. The pita is sitting out and also old and cold. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Chipotle goes Greek! 

My boyfriend and I decided to explore Mount Lebanon, but by the time we arrived, it was way past lunchtime. After looking through some menus on windows, we decided to go here for a quick, casual meal. 

Around 2:30 on the weekend, the store is not too busy. The staff were very friendly and helpful--they patiently explained how to order, what the toppings were, and how our choices affected the pricing. The setup is very much like Chipotle. You pick a pita (whole wheat or white, small or regular) or bowl (rice or salad), a meat (a variety of options include gyro and chicken), and stack on the toppings. There are also sides and desserts. There are several tables in the store, which is brightly lit. We walked down the block to Clearview Commons to enjoy our lunch.

 I ordered a whole wheat regular pita. They brush the pita with oil and toss it on a grill to warm for a few minutes. I added gyro meat, which is freshly shaved from the spit. Then I was faced with the toppings. Rice: lemon rice, brown rice with lentils, or lentils. Beans: green beans, navy beans, or green beans with potatoes in tomato sauce (I always considered green beans more of a vegetable, but this is cool too). Sauce: Greek yogurt tzatziki or sour cream tzatziki. Cold toppings: lettuce, tomato, chickpeas, several types of olives, peppers... And they add whatever you want, carefully piling the toppings onto the pita. I got a little nervous at the height of my pita and limited myself, but I'll go all out next time. Then they wrap it up, and you have a delicious, warm pita ready to be devoured!

The pita was a little messy to eat. All the toppings mashed together into a medley of flavors. Between bites, I noticed the gyro was well seasoned, the pita was warm and soft, something (the green beans?) was buttery, the Greek yogurt tzatziki lent just the right amount of moisture, and everything tasted fresh and delicious. My boyfriend and I agreed that it was a hearty, yummy meal for a reasonable price. I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered online on their website, they take the money off my card.  Arrive to a dark, empty restaurant with a locked door at 8pm on a Saturday night.  Got a refund easily from the third party processor but never again!   Thanks Simple Greek!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. I would give it 8 stars. 

This place is so GREAT, so much that it deserves ALL CAPS OH MY GOD. It's basically set up just like a Greek chipotle and the food is soo delicious and fresh. For basically the same price as a burrito bowl ($8.50 with tax) you can have truly delicious Greek food.

I went for the rice bowl with lentils and chicken. They give you a huge portion of meat (no skimping here!) and all the greek yogurt/veggies/feta/olives you want! Be careful though, olives are not pitted. Sorry molars ... 

And when I teetered back and forth over getting a side of hummus, the gal putting my bowl together said to just get some hummus in the bowl since it comes with pita, so I didn't' have to pay more. (My wallet thanks ye kind lady!)

Super excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place as I like Greek food. However the restaurant had an old and dirty feel about it. As you go down the line and select your ingredient toppings, the food is not presented in an appealing way. 
They really need to freshen up this place with a more modern and clean appearance and presentation of food."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by my yogurt bowl with hummus, vegetables, and pita, topped with honey, lemon and sea salt (an interesting combination that I completely enjoyed). The staff kept the line of customers moving (around 12 pm) and were very polite. A terrific place for lunch to go -- and the food was fresh and had great flavor."}
{"text":"These guys do a good job of making quick gyro and other items. HOWEVER they need to know the difference between sour cream and yogurt. Today I asked for yogurt and they gave me sour cream...even after I questioned what they were putting on my salad.

Otherwise, a nice quick downtown lunchtime option."}
{"text":"For not the wait, it would have been a 5 star. The food is delicious and flavorful with all Indianess. Loved all the ordered items. This place closes late and they do home delivery, so if you don't want to wait in their palce, just order online."}
{"text":"I had eaten here several times before the concept was changed from My Big Fat Greek Gyro to The Simple Greek.  The old store was pretty good, the new store is very good.  In addition to having the traditional gyro sandwich, there are now options to add rice, lentils, feta cheese, whole wheat pitas and more.  The salad bowls are a fine menu item as well. The only small disappointment I had was with the fries (and it was minor)  I do enjoy fresh cut fries (the Potato Patch at Kennywood Park comes to mind). The old fries were not bad --they stayed hot and crispy, where fresh cuts tend to get cold and limp very quickly.  But who goes to a Greek restaurant for the fries?  I did not try the desserts, but I plan to on my next visit.

 We went there on a Saturday night about 6PM.  The store was empty when we arrived, but by the time we left at 6:45, the place had filled up and some customers were getting their food to go.  The staff worked quickly and was able to keep up with the crowd."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in market square.  Quick, tasty, and simple.  The rice and salad bowls are great, as are the gyros.  

Downside is that it could be a buck or two cheaper.  The grape leaves aren't that great, which is disappointing.  Would be nice to be able to get a greek salad with no meat and tons of vegetables for a few bucks cheaper than their bowls.

In the end, one of the better spots in market square to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I am sad that My Big Fat Greek Gyro is gone. I don't like all of the options. My pita bread was burnt. We asked for traditional gyros and got a big mess. Sorry but we really don't like the remodel."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. They have lot's of fresh, healthy options alongside their traditional Greek favourites. I got the gyro bowl with lemon rice, traditional lamb green beans, kale, tzatziki sauce and lots of fresh veggies (it came with half of a grilled pita). Everything was delicious and fresh, we also tried the Greek fries and baklava cheesecake, both were exceptional! The restaurant was clean and the service was very nice. The food was a good deal, however, if you get a bowl and don't load it up with all the options, it may seem a bit steep. In all I would definitely recommend, especially if you're looking for a fresh, filling meal. You can eat your food there or take it to go. I believe they deliver too."}
{"text":"Nothing like a gyro to brighten a challenging day!   Greek food has always been my #1 favorite.  I have always wanted to check out the Simple Greek but anytime I've been \"dantahn\"   they are about to close or all ready closed (close at 7).

Simple Greek is no doubt a Greek food lovers palace !! Build your own bowl or pita - with your choice of meat, toppings and even sauces people!!  Everything was so fresh and could barely finish the gyro I ordered... it was big. The staff is super friendly too.   Two different types of fries offered- Greek and Fresh cut fries!! I just love that!    It was pure ouranos!!!  

You can buy beer and wine there too (limited availability in the fridge case) Theres so much more The Simple Greek.. I totally recommend.
5 stars easily ...

I cant wait to go back and try something else..

                     Efharisto  \"the Simple Greek!\""}
{"text":"Chicken was over cooked
Lentils were undercooked
I had the bowl and towards the end it was more of a soup, even though I asked them to drain the veggies. Also overpriced"}
{"text":"I was driving through Mt. Lebanon at lunchtime and saw a new sign on Washington Rd. I'm glad I stopped to investigate because I was in for a delicious surprise! 

The Simple Greek is essentially a Greek food version of Chipotle and Qdoba (with all the same greatness!) You can build a pita, a salad, or a bowl with rice, vegetables, sauces, and meats to your own liking. I had a gyro meat rice bowl with delicious sour cream tzatziki sauce, green beans and potatoes in red sauce, and fresh veggies on top. I was so excited that I could decide what flavors to put together! They really make it to suit you--when I asked to try both types of rice in my bowl, the man making my meal was perfectly willing to split it down the middle to make it just the way I wanted it.

Additionally, the staff there was wonderful! I really appreciated that they took the time to explain what was in everything because, as someone with multiple food allergies, I hate to be surprised. Also, the woman in line behind me was asking about the vegetarian options on the menu and the man assisting her seemed very accommodating to her too. Each person I talked to seemed genuinely happy that I was there to eat, and that is always a plus in my book!

The atmosphere is welcoming, the place looks clean and well-maintained, and I'm eager to recommend it to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Always very fresh ingredients. The service is top notch as well. We love the gyros and my wife loves there salads. If your in the McMurray area, stop in you won't regret it"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, but the light and decor is more like a gas station. The food is plain and over price for what you get. Portions are stingy. Worst Dolmades I ever had; dried leaves stuffed with rice that lacked any kind of flavor and seasonings. The staff were friendly and helpful that is why I gave it two stars, otherwise it would have been zero! Skip this place, spend the money and go to the Persian Room on Scottsdale Road."}
{"text":"The menu is ok, not stellar.  The best thing is their Lemon rice.  Incredible.  The rest was, meh."}
{"text":"I won't be going back. The blonde girl that works Saturdays didn't even fill my bowl halfway.  On top of that, she serves burnt chicken. It was so bad that my husband wouldn't touch it.  Not my favorite place anymore. Price has increased and customer service and attention to detail has decreased. I would much rather go to Cedars."}
{"text":"Staff was helpful making suggestions. They also are very nice and positive.

Food was tasty, and fresh ingredients.

Definitely will add to my list of restaurants to tap when working late."}
{"text":"Great food quick service. First time here and it's better than the Greek place back home"}
{"text":"I came in and got a gyro during lunch. The line was long but moved through pretty quickly. Good service.  The gyro meat was great along with the yogurt sauce and other toppings.  I'm definitely coming back in to try the chicken next time."}
{"text":"As a fan of Mediterranean tastes, this place could not be any more delicious. The salad bowls can be loaded up with everything you crave when you want some Greek food: fresh olives, hummus, gyro meat, green beans, etc. It's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I originally came here immediately after the show \"The Profit\" aired, as I thought it would be cool to check out a venue that was apart of a reality show. That brought me in originally, but the food has kept me coming back! Everyone is always extremely nice, and the gyros are amazing. This is basically a Chipotle style gyro place, as you pick everything that you want on your gyro. A very clever idea, indeed. They always load up the meat, which is fantastic. The green beans are an added bonus, and the yogurt based sauce is incredible. Overall, I would definitely suggest going here if you're in the Lebo area."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. As I don't live in the area this place always hits the spot. The staff is friendly and know what their doing. Gyro sizes are huge with is another plus."}
{"text":"Just love the Simple Greek. I stop at the Mt. Lebanon location often for lunch and it's always great. As others mention, it's like Chipotle but with Greek options. You order at the counter and choose everything from your protein to veggies and toppings. The food is always fresh and delicious and the employees are always really friendly. Definitely a solid stop on Washington Road when looking for something healthy and quick."}
{"text":"Good food but questionable cleanliness. As I sat and ate I noticed 1 of the workers wipe their runny nose with their hands and get back to preparing food."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in Market Square. 

Friendly, fast service and fresh food. I love the concept of their \"rice bowl,\" which comes with a lemon rice (lentils optional), your choice of protein, and then various delicious toppings such as olives, feta, onions, green beans, etc. The bowl is topped off with your choice of sauce as well.

Great decor and a nice addition to downtown. I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I are big fans of \"The Profit,\" so we thought we would give The Simple Greek a try while we were in Pittsburgh.  Overall, we were underwhelmed.  The restaurant was understaffed and the interior looked like it had been a while since it had been cleaned.  The ordering process was simple as advertised, and the cost was reasonable for the large amount of food we received (about $12/person).  Our food was ok (I got a gyro on pita bread and lentils w/rice), but it wasn't anything special.  After seeing it on \"The Profit,\" we hoped the quality would be better.  The Simple Greek is a decent option for Greek food if you're in Market Square in Pittsburgh, but it's not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Very very good. Great menu and love the choice of gyro in a bowl versus a pita."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and a great Greek lunch shack! 
I love their options of tzatziki...the Greek fries, and their classic gyro!
I'm impressed with how crowded it gets for a hidden away lunch shack!"}
{"text":"Delicious Greek offerings and speedy service. 

Gyro = very good
Grape Leaves = adequate
Lemon Rice = my favorite item

Great lunch spot. Grab something to go and enjoy your meal in Market Square this spring / summer."}
{"text":"The worst part about my review is that I can't even comment on the food because I didn't get that far, due to the myriad of complete morons that work there."}
{"text":"This was my all time favorite gyro place, when it was My Big Fat Greek Gyro. Their gyros were my absolute favorite. Now they have remodeled and revamped the restaurant into a fast casual Greek restaurant (think a Greek version of Chipotle), called The Simple Greek. Most is the same, they have some indoor seats, and a fabulous little courtyard next to a great trail. 

The food is mostly the same, although the gyro feels MUCH smaller than it used to be. The Greek fries are great with feta and spices on them, but as for the fries themselves, the old fries were better. Their Greek salad is still good. And the bowl option is nice, but the chicken on our bowl was a little cold and dry. The meat isn't quite as tasty as before, not sure why, but it seems a little less flavorful. 

We used to eat there all the time, getting gyros, gyro platters, fries and Greek salad. It wasn't cheap, but the value was there. Their gyro platter was able to feed me and at least one child, with a deconstructed gyro, salad and fries. Now to feed our family, the cost is too high and the value isn't there. If we are going to grab fast casual, and pay a little more for lunch, we will be grabbing Chipotle. Sadly, The Simple Greek isn't for us anymore."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time.  It was just ok. I got a chicken bowl.  Chicken and lentil rice were both really dry.  I did come at 2:30 pm at the end of the lunch rush, so maybe this had something to do with it.  The green bean garnish was just ok, the cucumbers and tomatoes were very fresh and tasty.  I also ordered fries.  You get a lot of them, but they were not cooked long enough at all.  Soggy and undercooked.    I will try them again during a \"lunch rush\" now that I know how to order and see if its any better.  The food probably won't be sitting around as long."}
{"text":"The most amazing potatoes, gyros and green beans!    I frequent many Greek restaurants but this one is the best!  Service is wonderful too!    I will return."}
{"text":"Snobby employee ! I am so hesitant to go get food knowing it will be a snobby employee who hates it when u ask for potatoes that were still cooking! Omg . I just spent almost 30$ and get my food thrown together and barely gave me rice! Thanks! Will not be back"}
{"text":"As a first time visitor to Pittsburgh, I asked the hotel concierge for a good place for lunch and she pointed me to Market Square with it's host of choices. I honed in on The Simple Greek as I prefer to skip chains whenever possible and there were a fair number of these to be found in the square. Additionally the line was at to the door so either it was really good or grossly inefficient. I am happy to report the former rather than the latter.

The line actually moves pretty quickly but I did feel some pressure to know exactly what I wanted to order to keep things moving and not screw it up for all the regulars in line. I selected a gyro salad bowl on to which I had green beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese with Tzatziki sauce added. Everything was quite fresh and yummy. Despite the line, there were several free seats available for eating there. Most folks seem to be taking it to go to chow back at their desk. I found their prices to be quite reasonable and the meal overall quite satisfying."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not only was the food amazing but the service was fantastic. Super friendly staff and I was amazed at how quickly our food was prepared. Have to try the grape leaves. So good! I will definitely be a regular at the Simple Greek!"}
{"text":"I was never able to make it to the Simple Greek during its first opening, but when I heard it was reopening I decided to try it. I went with my family, and wow, I was surprised by how great I found it!! There were so many options for your bowl or pita, and it was very customizable. Easy to go for the traditional gyro, or try something more to your personal tastes. They didn't skimp on any of the toppings at all (looking at you, Subway!), but piled it on so it really felt like we were getting our money's worth. There were so many options for toppings, but there were also a ton of sides I wished I had the stomach capacity to try. One of the sides we sprung for were the Greek fries, and they were so delicious I couldn't stop myself from eating them! Everything we ate tasted delicious, and I even happily ate the garlic green beans (which I am usually not a fan of anywhere else). And to top it off, the employees were all fantastic!! So kind and welcoming, and were great at helping us understand how to order! It's a shame that the restaurant was so empty at the time we went, they really deserve more business. We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh. The Simple Greek is a delicious and quick Greek restaurant. They have the meat rotating and they heat their pitas on a grill. The customer service is outstanding, they so kind and helpful. I was in Pittsburgh on a work trip and went to the restaurant Revel & Roost to try to get a table, that was a recommendation from one of my friends who lived in the area. They told me since I was alone they could not seat me. I thought that was extremely rude. It's hard enough being alone on a work trip and having to dine by yourself and then to get such snobby attitude from a local establishment, was unfortunate. After that, I The Simple Greek and I decided Greek food would be amazing. I ended up getting a bowl. You can choose getting either a bowl or a pita. I decided to get lentils for my base. I got grilled chicken and a lot of different toppings with hummus, all mixed together. I got it to go and I ate half of it in the restaurant and ate the other half later. The portions are very generous and it was a delicious meal and good choice on my part. The price was ridiculously affordable.I highly recommend going here for quick, fantastic Greek bowl or pita."}
{"text":"Visited during the lunch hour. Found menu a little confusing as to what I could put together. Ordered the typical Gyros, added tomato which I told the server to take off as it was not remotely red and cucumber which sadly had no marinade for flavor. No iced tea available except  one brand of bottled I don't care for so ended up with water cup. Very unhappy the pita was cold, meat was cold and dry and there was fresh on the spit but mine came out of a metal container on the service line. Horror of all the cashier mispronounced Gyros by a mile. Very noisy and servers couldn't hear me and I couldn't hear them. I had to keep repeating what I wanted which is very annoying. Music very loud. 8 people were eating, 6 had water cups, 2 brought in their own drink-did they also want iced tea or do they dislike Pepsi products as I do? So disappointed as I miss Daphne's and have been waiting for another Greek place but this isn't it. Back to the old standby in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch! Although not as authentic as some places, if you're looking for something good and quick I would highly recommend. The chicken gyro is fantastic as well as their Greek salad."}
{"text":"This place is an upgrade from its previous gyro place. It is on the pricey side for lunch, but I am happy to pay for a customized salad once in a while. 
You can pick your own meat - gyro is my favorite and chicken is my least favorite. They have pork and steak but you have to wait for them to make it.
You can select from a variety of hot sides and cold sides. Hot include potato with green beans or just green beans. Cold include tomato, lettuce, onion, hummus etc.
However, just watch out for anything you ordered on the side to make sure they didn't forget to put it in. I also found myself having to watch carefully to make sure they follow my requests. I caught them a couple times coming close to giving me the wrong item.
Good lunch spot if you crave a gyro salad nearby, not worth going out of your way for it though."}
{"text":"I've become addicted to The Simple Greek in a very short time. I wandered in one day after meeting up with a friend at a nearby coffee shop, and quickly decided I wanted everything on the menu (and carted away a good bit of it for dinner that night). 

The food is all very fresh and made in front of you - a nice large hunk of lamb twirls behind the counter ready to be shaved off for gyros (a little visual thrill I always enjoy) and their fries are fried fresh for you when you order. Oh, wait. The Fries.

The fries at The Simple Greek are to-die-for. You cannot order just a basic basket of fries. That would deprive you of the visceral joy of consuming their Greek fries, which are tossed with garlic salt, oregano, chunks of feta and then splashed with red wine vinegar. It's just a true pleasure. It's like having the Greek version of chili cheese fries, except they are light and fresh and don't leave you feeling like you need to be rolled home afterwards. I've never ordered fries at a Greek place before, but I can't resist these when I come in.

The gyros are gyros. When you get a good, hearty gyro, it's just like a good burger. It's solid and steady and utterly familiar. Theirs are totally top quality and have a TON of meat on them. They have a \"double protein\" option and I can't even imagine what their gyro would look like with double the meat! I do like that they offer you a choice of two different tzatziki sauces - one with a yogurt base and the other with a sour cream base - which is a nice feature. I tried the yogurt tzatziki sauce the first time in an effort to go with a more traditional Greek taste, but I like the sharpness of the sour cream better. Also, while I like my gyros with all the traditional toppings, they do a little bit of a Subway/Chipotle thing, and you can add all sorts of crazy toppings if you so desire.

Their sides are all outstanding as well. I really enjoyed my wrapped grape leaves, and the spanakopita wedge is delicious and melty because they put it on the grill right before serving it to make it nice and toasty. This is a very clever feature and a great way to make some of the more complicated Greek dishes beforehand but still have them be just as fresh when they serve them later.

But what keeps me coming back, especially in the winter, is their lemon chicken soup. It's a traditional Greek soup called Avgolemono, but no one can pronounce it (not even the employees behind the counter, I seriously just had to Google the spelling). So while I appreciate the authenticity, honestly, they should just call it Lemon Chicken soup and be done with it. I have it every time I go in there, and The Simple Greek should just make it a permanent fixture on the menu instead of saying \"soup of the day\" because it's all anybody wants. It gets served to you along with a freshly grilled, piping hot pita cut up into wedges, and the taste and texture combination is blissful. Actually, I would consider this my new perfect \"I'm-sick-as-a-dog-bring-me-a-cold-flu-remedy-stat\" soup.

The best part is, they are starting delivery at this location! I am bound to get sick by the end of the winter, so I'm totally keeping them on hand for a bit of a \"Greek mama\" pick-me-up. Mmm...I think I need some soup again. Sounds like lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great food.  All fresh ingredients.  Super friendly employees.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out yesterday, it was so good we went again today! We went around lunchtime. There was no line, and the man helping us was very friendly. We got so much food for a great price. It felt like a Greek chipotle."}
{"text":"** This review is not based on food.** 

We didn't get to make it to the food. We pulled up, it was a very small place set back off the road. No one was there on a Saturday night except for us. The workers were all sitting in the front looking bored like it was closing time. It was weird and I felt uncomfortable and didn't want to enter. I didn't want it to be an awkward situation. We ended up just ordering food from somewhere else. Poor first impression, not sure we will try it out."}
{"text":"Formerly it was My Big Fat Greek Gyro, that's when it was worth going.  Now they changed the name and are trying to expand and commercialize.  The portions are cut way back.  There is less meat on the gyros and the fries are half the size.  One plus is that they are fresh cut fries now.  The food is still good, but you are getting less.  By trying to expand, a good business is being destroyed."}
{"text":"I don't like lines. Who does? I especially don't like lunch lines at high noon in Market Square. Yet there I was, at the stroke of 12:30, with four companions. What to do?  Well, we met in front of Simple Greek, so we thought we'd take a peek inside, where we found ZERO line!  To be honest, I'm not sure why, given that after thoroughly enjoying a greek/lentil salad, I left thinking it should be more popular.  It's a little pricey for what you get, but sometimes it's worth it to splurge for a warm, soft pita, great service and awesome flavors.  Check it aht!"}
{"text":"Very good!  I've only been here once, so I'll update after my next visit, and we could reach 5-stars.  It's really good.  Here's why:

1.  It's clean and open.  I like the white tile walls and floor, which make it feel open and light.

2.  The traditional gyro is EXCELLENT.  The lamb meat is tasty, hot, and moist.  I like the traditional toppings (lettuce, tomato, Greek sauce).  The pita is grilled and hot to order.  The whole sammy takes about a minute to make, so it's quick.  They wrap it in foil so it stays hot.

3.  The two young men working there were helpful to my wife and me as newbies.  When I asked \"what's the traditional way?\" they told me, which I like.

I tried my wife's Chicken Gyro, and it was okay, but the chicken was not seasoned much, so it was kind of bland.  I suggest sticking with lamb!

That's it!  Give them a try and let us know what you think!"}
{"text":"I was driving through the area due to a highway re-route and we saw this Greek restaurant and thought to stop by (given also the lack of Greek restaurants in the greater area). As soon as we walked in the venue I knew we were up for a nice experience. Just a disclaimer do not expect a gourmet restaurant but rather a quick grab place that is very well run and kept.

The service is friendly and fast and the food selection is large give the type of restaurant. You can build your own gyro and there is a large choice of toppings and side dishes. I have to admit though that the food was a little on the greasy side but this is a \"diner\"-style \"fast food\" place after all.  I will definitely visiting it again when I am around the area."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town the service was great owner is there all the time taking care of his business"}
{"text":"2 words...Pita Bistro. They've already mastered this concept. Very disappointing. The hummus was dry and the chicken was cold."}
{"text":"Love this place and wish I lived closer!  Great fresh, healthy, fast, and delicious Greek/Middle-eastern food at an inexpensive price point. 

They've got the Lemon Chicken & Rice soup and lentil soup; Beef & Chicken Gyro, Steak, Chicken, Lentils, Falafel, stuffed grape leaves, humus; baklava, baklava cheesecake, Greek yogurt &fruit, etc., etc., etc!  
REAL FOOD, REAL DELICIOUS!

I personally love the whole-wheat Greek pita bread, traditional Gyro meat and tizziki  sauce, with lots of fresh toppings, including lettuce, tomato, cucumber, red onion, Greek salad, Pepperoncini, and kalamata olives.

My vegan hubby likes his whole-wheat Greek pita with harissa hummus, lentils, lots of lettuce, Greek Salad, Tomatoes, cucumbers, purple onion, kalamata olives, Greek olives, and Greek Peppers, oil &vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano.

What's even better? It's as fast as subway (all these fresh veggies and great meat & meatless proteins are laid out before your eyes on a hot and a cold line). And the price: $6.99 for a pita sandwich with all the toppings your little heart desires!

And did I say really DELICIOUS and healthy?"}
{"text":"On the plus side, it's speedy, reasonably priced,, with vegetarian options and  made to order. The staff were friendly and helpful.

To the negative, some of the food was rather greasy.

We particularly? enjoyed the made to order salad. We added the delicious Greek olives, green beans,  tzatziki sauce, beans, hot peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers. 

The spanikopita was just okay, nothing like what I bought at the Greek Fest. The Hummus was okay.

There were plenty of places to sit, especially outside. Tables were relatively clean."}
{"text":"This is basically Chipotle bowls for Greek food - and I am a fan!  I had the chicken which was really nicely cooked and seasoned over lemon rice.  I added Tzatziki, cucumbers, beans with kale and tomatoes, olives, feta, chick peas and red onion.  It comes with two pieces of pita bread.  I also ordered grape leaves as they are my go-to Greek food item.  These left a bit to be desired, but the rest of the meal was delicious.  They also have a yogurt bar which I will have to try out next."}
{"text":"Girl wiped her nose with her bare hands then automatically began handling my food with her bare hands. Needless to say I walked out"}
{"text":"I came in today and ordered a gyro for the first time for lunch. The two girls working were especially kind and helpful! Will definitely be coming back and the service played a big part!"}
{"text":"Whomever called this the Chipotle of Greek food pretty much nailed it.  You start off with a decision between a pita wrap, rice, or salad base, and take it from there with proteins and toppings.  There are lots of side-dish options too.  It can get crazy at lunch time because of its location in the epicenter of the downtown business district, but you get through it pretty fast and if you're lucky, you can snag some outdoor seating and people-watch on Market Square.  For what you get, I find the price to be reasonable and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"It may be a good idea for Mr Lemonis to come by to do a quick run through.  why did  the restaurant open 20+ min past its stated opening time?   the restaurant was kind of dirty, empty ketchup container, no napkins at table, no cheese pies, place looked disorganized....the food was good, but i expected a better experience. Also... napkins instead of paper towels in bathroom... and the place was
suppose to open at 2 for lunch on 4th of Jul.... Isnt that kind of late???"}
{"text":"My husband and I attended the Grand Opening on 11/9/2017 and was pleasantly surprised. It is set up in the fashion of Chipotle or Fired Pie where you move down the line and can pick various sauces and toppings and build your own gyro. We had it the traditional way and thoroughly enjoyed it. The greek fries and baklava looked delicious. The owner was there and he seemed like a very nice guy. I sure hope this business does well as we like to frequent casual, reasonable eateries that are not over priced. OPA!"}
{"text":"Good food. Very packed at lunch time, but the line flys! I would stay with the traditional gyro meat as the chicken tends be be pretty dry. Altogether great service from a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Meh. Everything was cold: the temperature, the chicken, the atmosphere. I really wanted some hot avgolemono, but they didn't have any (in spite of what the sign in front window said). Service was polite, but odd-we had to repeat our order several times. Prices for what are often standard sides at other Greek places were high and the food was underwhelming (e.g. Fries were soggy and the rice pudding didn't seem fresh). Extra minus: no baby changing station in bathroom; my wife had to use the floor. Watch out for the new place next door-that's where we'll be going next time."}
{"text":"I, like many people I'm sure, first heard about this place on The Profit so I of course had high expectations for it! I have to start off by saying the food did not disappoint. I went with a gyro bowl. The gyro meat was quite possibly the best I ever had!! I did really enjoy the \"build your own\" concept for something like this, it was refreshing & fun. The two young guys working the night we went in were also very nice & helpful. So you're probably wondering why not 5 stars??? So, as much as I loved the open ordering I did find it overwhelming as a first time visitor because things were not labeled. Sure the garlic green beans were easy to figure out, but there was a potato/pepper Side I'm still not sure what it was :) I suppose as I become more of a regular I'll get the hang of it!

I think a fun and easy way to remedy the situation would be to have pictures or examples of combos that could be made so people see what is what. They could even name them after famous Pittsburghers :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving it an OK review, but that doesn't mean anything.  There is a handwritten sign on the door that says they are closed - I didn't know if that meant for the day? Until they come back? Really odd. So Today I called and it goes to voice mail - just as if you were calling after hours. So I don't know what's up,. but I sure wanted to check them out!  I have lived here 6 months and I have yet to have a really good Chicago style gyro."}
{"text":"This place should definitely have a higher rating! This restaurant is basically the Greek Chipotle. The food is prepared and served by Greeks so the tastes are authentic. This was the best tasting gyro I ever had because then meats and sauces were so flavorful! I got a gyro bowl and it was a great deal! Greek food is somewhat scarce in the area and to provide it in such a quick, efficient manner is great! This is definitely not much of a sit down restaurant and the space isn't super inviting but there is plenty of room in the plaza to sit and eat. I went here during Light Up Night and was able to get my food fast even though the line was practically out the door. I also love the customizability to the meal. Great concept, location, tastes, and services. Only downside is the interior of the restaurant, but if you don't plan to eat inside, then it's easily overlookable."}
{"text":"Now that I work nearby, this has become such a reliable lunch spot.  Like other folks have mentioned, this is a counter service spot where you build a bowl or a wrap by going down the line and picking your ingredients.  The food is solid: fresh and healthier than most spots in Market Square.  A regular bowl is big enough for two meals if you load up on toppings, which makes the price positively reasonable!  The line moves quick, but they tend to run out of a topping here and there when things get busy (no chicken gyro meat today, womp womp.....)"}
{"text":"Had lunch during the week of their grand opening. Great food at a great price."}
{"text":"Looking for fast casual food in a great setting and The simple Greek was PERFECT. Food was fresh, tasty and as a vegan, lots of choices. Sat outside and enjoyed the ambiance of Market Square"}
{"text":"Pleasant staff, great food. Not too much for vegetarians, however. We had a big lunch and went with sides for dinner- fries, pita bread, salad. While the food is somewhat bland, it was filling and the hummus and fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"Very simple food, like a chippotle for greek food. I really like being able to grab something and just seat down in market square at night and have good food without having to wait hours for a waitress. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay and the flow when you order needs work. 

The outdoor seating area was pleasant. 

The chicken was dry; the gyro was better. 

The fries were underwhelming."}
{"text":"Picked up gyros and sides for my wife and myself. The gyro meat was quite good, as were the toppings. Two different people were making the gyros at the same time, but the one making my wife's gyro forgot onions and cucumber sauce. The spinakopita was very good, done perfectly. The dolmades were inedible, just absolutely awful. The rice pilaf was okay, much better when covered in lemon juice. The baklava was very good, a bit sweeter than I've had before."}
{"text":"Service was great and it was clean inside, I got the build your own bowl and the tzaziki and hummus were good, the chicken gyro meet was a bit dry and the brown rice has some under cooked crispy pieces. Once they work out the kinks it should be a good place for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"First timer. Lunch. It's kinda like a Greek \"Chipotle.\" (And I love Chipotle.) The customer line was long, but they moved it along at a good clip. The staff was efficient and a little friendlier than most fast food places of the sort. And they had drafts! (May not be for every lunch, but it's a nice amenity.) 

The food was good, really good for the price, and the staff acted like they own the place (in a good way)."}
{"text":"Food was ok servers were good but nothing authentic about the taste.  Grape leaves were nasty and had uncooked hard rice.  A little too pricey for a $8 gyro sandwich that i can get for half the price everywhere else."}
{"text":"I thought all Gyros were pretty much the same until having my latest from The Simple Greek. 

I used to frequent there in the days when it was My Big Fat Greek Gyro. Back then it was a pretty decent gyro. No Mike and Tony's but close, and still pretty good. I haven't been there many times since the name and ownership change, but don't think I'll be back. First of all, the service is anything but warm and friendly. But hey, it's a fast food Gyro place so I'm not expecting great service. But. at least act like you give a damn that I'm patronizing the place and not a burden to you.

On to the food....The Gyros stink. I'm no gyro connoisseur, but I know the Simple Greek's gyros are lousy. The meat is dry, tough, and flavorless. I think the new ownership is cheapening out on the quality of the meat. The Tzatziki (sp?) sauce has an odd flavor. All makes for one crappy gyro. And while the fries are fresh cut, (which is typically a really good thing), the kids working the place don't know how to cook them. They're undercooked, soggy, and under seasoned. A tough thing to ruin, but the Simple Greek has mastered ruining fires too. 

I feel bad for the owners, but they really need to go back to the way things were before trying to become a national chain."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Went on a Saturday night at about 7 and the place, unfortunately, was deserted.  (I hope that changes.)  The kids behind the counter were very helpful and friendly.  

I got a gyro salad and my husband had a gyro (see review from earlier tonight).  Both were very tasty.  I had the yogurt-based tzatziki and he had the sour cream-based.  Portions were generous, especially for $8 each.  With drinks and tax, the total was just over $20 - a steal Lebo.  

This place used to be a big fat greek gyro, but the owners re-designed/branded the place.  Apparently, they'll be on an episode of \"where's the profit\".   My husband thought the change was a good move.  I'd never been to the prior version, but he had.  He thought the place had a bit of an identity crisis, though the gyro was solid.  (Not as bright or open, single guy behind the counter... Was it a mom and pop shop?)  The new rendition is open, clean and you can see all the food.  (It's greek does subway/chipolte.)  

Anyhow, this place is a great neighborhood addition.  Nice time you're looking for something quick and/or reasonably healthy and cheap, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, and healthy (nutrition info on the website)! The food here, especially the lentil soup and green beans, might be my favorite anywhere... shhh don't tell my Greek mama. The pita bread is toasty, the hummus is tasty and garlicky and I love that you can create your meal however you like. It's my go-to when I'm not sure exactly what I want because I love everything! It doesn't hurt that the service is always welcoming, thoughtful and kind."}
{"text":"We got gyros and fries and spent a substantial amount from what I'd call street food. The gyro meat and sauce were really plain for the price we paid. Most likely won't be going back"}
{"text":"When you're counting calories, a bad/disappointing meal is a terrible waste. 

I was so hopeful this place was going to be good. It's a fast casual restaurant's duty to serve good food at a value price. Not here, kids. 

1.  The gyros are too small. The gyro meat was tasty though
2.  No falafel. Yes, a Greek joint that doesn't offer falafel. Whose brilliant idea was this?
3.  The dolmades were without the customary lemony sauce. Instead it was rice, meat and a modicum of seasoning wrapped in a toothy grape leaf.  And $2.99 for three. Utterly flat tasting
4.  The place is lit brighter'n Runway 1 at Sky Harbor. And the floor is white vinyl. Blinding fails to describe, but beacon-ish comes close. 

Saving grace is the friendly, helpful staff members. They were as nice as can be. 

I'll not be returning."}
{"text":"The Simple Greek was good. That's it. The staff wasn't organized but they were friendly enough. My friend ordered some steak and they were out (not a big deal) but it took everyone in the kitchen to figure it out and they looked terrified when she ordered it, which was weird. I had a gyro and it was good, they did load it with too much meat for my taste, but I'm sure a lot of people like that. They do have a nice outdoor area that looks across the farmer's market, so that was pleasant. Like I said, it was good. But nothing special."}
{"text":"Great location just off Montour Trail. Come hungry though! Portions are huge. Pita on wheat was wonderful. Moist gyro meat perfectly done and hand carved. Don't forget the spanakopita and the tiropita as an extra. The crust were flaky and perfect. Highly recommended as a stop on your walk, run, bike ride."}
{"text":"I had opted to stop by today for lunch but seem they were closed. 12 health violations? I'm shocked. It was always very clean when I was there, food was great, priced right. It's hard to believe."}
{"text":"I noticed on Facebook that there was an advertisement for this restaurant so my wife and I decided to give it a try.  The first thing we noticed was how clean it was.  Almost every Greek Gyro restaurant we go into is dirty and the service not so good.  We were shocked when we walked in and it was clean and the customer service was amazing.  They were nice, listened to what we had to say and were more than accommodating.  The food was excellent.  We both had the gyro bowls with the pita on the side.  It was delicious!!!  I recommend trying this place.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new \"go to\" place! Went with a friend for lunch today. I had the grilled chicken and lentil bowl with tzaziki, feta, cucumbers,tomato and red onion. Finished off with oil,red wine vinegar and oregano. Delicious. You have a choice between warm white or wheat pita. My friend chose the gyro over greens and said it was great. No alcohol is served but the iced tea is good. We took refills to go. I will definitely return. Great place to pick up dinner on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Really good and simple Greek food. I did the kale salad and hooked it up with a bunch of protein and veggies. Their sauces are bomb."}
{"text":"Really great food and the staff was really helpful too. We had never been here before, and they walked us thru the menu. We ordered bowls, one with rice, one with lentil, and it was so delish! And not to mention really filling. The price was great too! We like this place a lot and wil be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in Pittsburgh. It's like Subway for pitas. Love to get the Greek salad with chicken and all the toppings I choose. Their Greek yogurts are also delicious! Great prices, too."}
{"text":"We had a catering delivered and my guests were so impressed ! Not the normal salad , pasta buffet 
Well done and our sincere thanks !
We will be back !"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would! Having recently moved to Pittsburgh, I have been rather disappointed in the lack of quality restaurants - lots of greasy mom and pop joints using very low-quality ingredients. There seems to be pizza and gyro shops on every corner and I had been unimpressed with all of them. Then I found The Simple Greek! 

This is a Chipotle-style, build-your-own gyro shop. Excellent quality ingredients (actual spring greens instead of shredded iceburg, etc.) but I was most happy to see they had a great selection of add-on ingredients. Finally, a gyro shop that offers actual Mediterranean ingredients like kalamata olives and feta! PLUS lots of other items like lentils or rice, green beans, tomatoes, onions, cukes, and on and on. Whole wheat pita and yogurt tatziki sauce make healthy substitutes.

I order the bowl and it is HUGE! Seriously, I could make a meal out of just the meat portion alone - they do not skimp! And you can choose chicken or steak in addition to traditional lamb. The rice pudding and baklava are super yummy also. Please, please, come check this place out - you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I popped in for lunch yesterday and boy am I glad I did!  The staff is amazingly friendly and the food is fresh.  I love the selection here for a few reasons: 
1. they have vegetarian options - wuhoo!
2. they have healthy options - lentils instead of rice, greek yogurt instead of sour cream, whole wheat pita instead of white
3. they grill the pita for you so it's nice and warm when you get it

Speaking of healthy food, make sure you order the fries Greek Style!  I think it's red wine vinegar, oregano and feta - yummmmm.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of those places I've never reviewed and go to all the time. Ugh, me.

It's a perfect spot to grab a quick lunch. I almost went today but decided to try the new Mediterranean place next door instead....this was a mistake. I should have eaten at The Simple Greek. 

Fast service, clean place, and really good food. I've been there quite a few times over the last year and get a large salad bowl usually with chicken or lentils or both. It's always very tasty. My favorite part of the meal is the beans--usually either sauteed green beans or white beans with kale. Really delicious! I don't know what they season them with but I'm a fan.

Love the yogurt tzatziki. Had the fries once and they were great as well-so fresh!"}
{"text":"Tucked in the middle of Market Square, this place is like a Greek version of Subway (in a good way).  Fresh ingredients, delivered assembly line-style.  I was able to get through the (long) line at the top of the busy noon rush and got a tasty, customized Greek meal in record time with no muss or fuss.

Bonus points for having lots of Keto-friendly choices, lentils, spicy(-ish) hummus and a solid tzatziki sauce (the mark of a true Greek joint).   T'was tasty!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try for lunch the other day.  I went with the small bowl with rice (as opposed to salad), chose rice with lentils, gyro meat, yogurt/tahini sauce (as opposed to the sour cream sauce) and topped with veggies.  The small was the perfect size for me but I could see how most folks were getting the large.  

I was disappointed that with the small size you only get 1/2 pita (2 pita quarters) as opposed to if you ordered the large size you get a full pita.  I think next time, I'll opt for the pita rather than the bowl."}
{"text":"4 stars for many reasons. 1. Portion size was really good, large enough to feel satisfied but not too full. 2. Little to no wait time during peak hours due to the way the line works. 3. Delicious food.

The negative downfall and the reason I couldn't give this place a 5 is the pita. My pita was severely freezer burned and I could even eat it due to the taste. Need to step this up! Good thing I got a bowl.."}
{"text":"Have you been to Subway?  Imagine that system but with gyros and Greek salads.  You go in and pick if you want white pita, wheat pitas, or a salad.  Then you go and pick your meat, tzaki sauce (they have 2 choices yogurt or sour cream based), and veggies.  
    
    There will be a line here at lunch, do NOT let that intimidate you, it typically moves very quickly and the staff is good at keeping it moving.  They also have alot of outdoor seating right there in Market square.  I highly reccomend grabbing your gyro and sitting outside on a nice summer day and enjoy the ambiance of Market square without the need to fight for a table and enjoying a great gyro."}
{"text":"Chipotle but for Greek food. A couple TVs in there to watch the games while you're dining. Very friendly staff, fairly priced. The Greek fries in particular were good. The baklava was delicious."}
{"text":"I got a gyro bowl and it was good, would definitely go back! Nice concept, it's like a Greek Chipotle. You walk up pick a pita or bowl, add a protein and pick your toppings."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always quick, always yummy! I go here regularly for lunch on the run and it's simply the best. Dare I say it but it's like the chipotle of Greek food.

Order a gyro and choose your meat and toppings. Order a bowl and choose between rices, lentils, salad, beans, and all with a meat as well. You can get unlimited toppings for no cost. They have tomatoes, cucumbers, chickpeas, olives, onions, sauce, and more. Just beware- extra sauce costs extra money.

I'm a petite person, so a small bowl is enough to fill my for lunch. I usually spend about $10 here for lunch and it is satisfying to my stomach and wallet. The staff is quick, efficient, and polite. You can eat in or carry-out; they will even give you utensils to go. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a bite to eat for lunch in Market Square and was curious about checking this place out, plus I love Greek food.

I was a little skeptical of another \"build your own\" type place when I first walked in, but The Simple Greek delivered.

I was surprised that they were actually visibly roasting the lamb (much like in other authentic shops I've seen while traveling). I ordered a salad bowl and the staff seemed to encourage you to add as much stuff to it as possible. They had an enormous variety of topics, well beyond the basics--3 choices of cucumber/tomato mixes and grape leaves for good measure.

The interior was decorated minimally, but had various seating options inside and out. The staff wasn't too friendly and this place is definitely a cafeteria style-clean up after yourself type place. Maybe it's just that it's not ANOTHER Mexican restaurant in its spot, maybe a little refreshing to get a little fancy with that salad bowl, but the food was 4 stars for a lunch joint!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fresh, delicious ingredients. Great service. Never disappointed. The Greek fries are awesome. I usually get a chicken pita or chicken bowl and add all the yummy toppings...tzatziki, olives, feta, cucumber. Highly recommend The Simple Greek."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: love the Profit, and love greek food, so ever since we saw the episode we wanted to vidit. Was near Pittsburgh on business,  so se made a 30 minute detour just to stop by s Dimple Greek. Entered about 4pm today and place was dead. We were the only people there. Guy at counter was pleasant and help describe options.  Proteins were all covered up with kids so the line did not 'look' appealing, but assume this it to keep food from dying when so slow. Started with Ovgolemonino soup. Thick and no taste of lemon
 Bland. Rice was super mushy, like it had been in the soup for days. Dolmades were actually good in terms of texture, but filling was also bland, no flavor.  Theme continues, like they are afraid to season so everything seemed to need a bit more punch. Greek fries, fresh fried, but says topped with Red wine vinegar and feta, no sign of vinegar, bland again. ( and no I never smoke, so my taste buds aren't defective ).  Ordered some Togo food for my wife to eat when I get home tonight.  Spanacopita was 'pan fried' in oil on a iron pan on top of grill????? Nor baked, so no 8dea how frozen filo dough will be when I get home. Looks awful visiall6. Bo golden crust, just black char on edges and then bleed looking felo, no sign of spinach until my wife cuts into it. Ice machine was out if ice, and instead of offering to get me ice, guy said to hold my cup at empty machine and 'some will eventually come out'... it never did, so after 30 awkward secind, he went and got ice to fill machine.  

As we're eating a lid comes 8n and got a gyro,  sat next 6o us and ate it. I wasn't watching to see if he paid for gyro, as I was too busy photographing my food. After he at he went to talk to guy at counter he appeared to know. He then walked over to dessert fridge and took a dessert and sat back down next to us. This time he did NOT pay for it, and his friend working definitely knew he took it. Giving away product: Theft... sane thing.

Also of note, you can't see there sign due to a big tree out front.  Another medatetain place opened NEXT DOOR!  A sloppy looking employee from next door sat right in front of Simple Greek smoking cigarettes.  Very off-putting. 

Overall it was not worth going out our way to visit."}
{"text":"Been coming here awhile and everytime its a worse and worse experience this time they drenched my pita in oil then when they put the meat on my pita the meats looks uncooked and of course when I take a bite it was cold as hell and the portions keep getting smaller and smaller definitely not worth the money anymore I paid for extra meat and it barely looks like a normal gyro also the girls that work there don't know what there doing they leave food just sitting there they also didn't put the Greek herbs I top of my gryo all while there on their phones overall horrible experience I hope they can change it around atleast they didn't charge me for extra sauce that the only good thing that came from todays experience"}
{"text":"Tried this place on the very first day (before their big opening). Gyro meat is very good and its fresh. Bowls are delicious and you can make your own combination. It's like a chipotle, but with greek ingredienrs."}
{"text":"Delicious salads and pitas! I have come here for lunch during the week and the line can get a little out of control... I would like to give them some advice to make the queuing a little faster but it's worth the wait for their salads. It's basically what you would expect at a greek restaurant, I do like that you can choose what you want on your pita/salad. 

I've had both the pita and the salad before, they offer different meats and proteins and then your choice of mix-ins."}
{"text":"It is the \"Chipotle\" of Greek food!  Portions are very generous.  You can choose your protein, veggies and sauces.  They have a yogurt-based tzatziki and a sour-cream based.  We had one of each between us, and really liked both.  I had the bowl which was an awesome salad.  It comes with pita triangles which was just right for lunch.  Very kid friendly in here, but no kids menu that I noticed."}
{"text":"The service and food was excellent. I loved the gyro and the fries-their spinokoptia, baklava, and rice pudding are to die for. The owners are awesome they were talking with me the entire time and they are very nice guys. 5 star restaurant with a family feel! I'll be back-every week!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. The chicken bowl is one of my favorite things to get for a healthier lunch out and keeps me full for a long time. Everything is very tasty. Occasionally the chicken has been slightly overcooked, and the menu is not the most diverse, but still remains one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Got chicken bowl with brown rice and a lot of toppings. Very flavorful. And yes, Amy's my wife!"}
{"text":"This was called \"My Big Fat Greek Gyro\".  It's still under the same ownership, just a different name.  There are a few improvements over the older establishment so we'll start with what's good.  The remodel is great.  The place looks cleaner.  It's really nice.  The menu is basically the same.  I've noticed they added whole wheat pita.  Nice.  

Unfortunately the attention to detail with the food is exactly the same.  The owner needs to go to Pita Land, sit down and eat a gyro there then try one of their own.  The gyros are ok at The Simple Greek, not great, just ok.  I like it when the meat isn't already roasted.  I like it when they have to turn it on and roast it then carve it fresh.  

The new fresh cut fries are a nice addition too but these were terrible.  They looked golden brown sort of but they ended up being undercooked soggy and greasy.  They were the biggest disappointment yesterday.  

I used to order a greek salad with chicken but the chicken was always overcooked and dry as was the gyro.  They still have hotel pans of dried out and getting drier meats waiting for you to walk in to order your salad.  I don't know if they're still misguidedly putting cheese in their dressings but I don't think I'll be back to find out. 

I went back to see if it was a new owner, new place.  Oh well."}
{"text":"love this new Greek restaurant. Food is great and it is easy.to ger in dor a quick lunch. the green beans are the best!"}
{"text":"Very fresh! They were flexible and creative with making vegan bowl for me. It was awesome!!! Lots of lemon olives cucumber er tomatoes green beans and more. I was surprised how much I liked it. Staff was fun music was good too. Not sure why they are closed on Saturdays... I could understand in winter... but in spring/summer there's so many festivals on Saturdays!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small little place next to the bike trail . Couple tables and a small counter . Had the chicken , gyro pita bread . The chicken was a little dry and would have preferred if the temperature of it was hotter . The gyro meat and pita bread was really good ! . Will have to come back and try the salad and the fresh cut fries ."}
{"text":"Saw that this restaurant had opened and decided to try tonight with my wife. 

The good:
Love the design and the concept
Staff was extremely nice

The bad:
Sign is small and barely visible, drove past it 2x looking for it
Chicken gyro meat was dry and cold
Lamb Gyro meat was dry and cold
Regular chicken was dry and cold
Feta was so salty, had to remove from my pita
Brown rice was not cooked fully or had been sitting there since noon and dried out

We were there at 7pm on a Friday night and it was pretty dead. Maybe that's the reason for the food being cold and dried out. 

Probably will wait a few more months to try again when they've got the kinks worked out. A Greek pita shouldn't be hard to make. For now I'll stick to my usual Chicago Gyros when i need my fix."}
{"text":"The chipotle of greek food. Not bad quality, a bit expensive, a bowl cost about 11 bucks.  Hold back on the onions if you don't want to have onion breath at work."}
{"text":"First time here and the food and service were both good. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting all three in my party with our ordering. I am very leery when dining at Greek restaurants as I am sensitive to MSG. I was educated on which meats I could order that did not contain MSG and I ordered the steak which was fabulous. I ordered a bowl and loved everything I put in it. Someone else had a gyro and fries and really enjoyed that. And we were with a senior citizen who ordered a child size meal and really enjoy that as well. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch that I could pick up to take and share with my hubby. My hubby had been craving gyros. I remembered The Simple Greek was en route to where I was going. This was my first time having food from here. The young gentleman behind the counter was very nice. Their menu is simple and straight forward. I like that. I ordered a gyro and then grilled chicken on a pita. You had the choice of regular or whole wheat pitas. I went whole wheat but next time I would order the regular pita. I ordered lettuce and sauce on both but added tomatoes and onions on the gyro. The gentleman asked if I wanted oregano sprinkled on them. I said yes but I probably won't have the oregano again on mine. I also ordered an order of fresh cut fries. They are made to order which is nice. You can get them regular or Greek which has vinegar and feta on them. I went with regular but next time I would try the Greek style fries. While waiting on the food I checked out the restaurant. It is almost all white but was extremely clean. 
The gyro and the grilled chicken were very good. My only real let down was the tzatziki sauce. It didn't have much flavor. It left me looking for more flavor. I would definitely go back and take friends or family."}
{"text":"It was Friday evening and we just attended an event in the square. We stopped here to grab a bite. This place is very small and casual. The decor was bright and clean. This place is the Greek version of chipotle. Good fresh, flavorful, food at a reasonable price, entirely customizable and a decent bit of options, including desert. My family includes a 3 year old and a 1 year old. They eat just about anything but this evening they enjoyed pita bread with hummus and fresh cut french fries. The hummus is very flavorful, strong garlic which I liked. They forgot to give us the hummus at first and when my hubby asked for it the owner or manager came over and gave us a free piece of baklava! I tried it and I think most people would love this. It was everything I like in baklava except I'm a huge anti-cinnamon person, so no thanks. We also ordered gyros which were very large and pita bread was soft and fresh. A substantial amount of meat but wasn't impressed with it, just average meat. We ordered the spanakopita and village salad too. Both were fresh and tasty! For our entire order, including 3 drinks it was $40. We could have spent less and walked away full but we wanted to try some of the appetizers. The gyros are huge! Just a gyro would have been enough for an average person. We took half of them home as well as some fries and a little bit of hummus. Basically 2 more meals. I didn't think it was a bad value considering the location, quality and amount of food we ordered. I would go back again but would like to try a different entree next time."}
{"text":"Super good fresh greek food. The homemade greek pudding is amazing!  Big portions, prices are reasonable.  The staff is super friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after seeing this place on The Profit. I was surprised by how messy it was, in front of and behind the counter. The staff were not engaging nor was there any 'flow' once I walked in. The guy that prepared my food was very polite, but offered no explanation of the options and didn't curate an experience. 

The food was good, not great. I'm not sure why a Greek spot uses American hot sauce and not Siracha hot sauce?"}
{"text":"Wish we would have tried Simple Greek the many other times I thought to! We stopped in for dinner on a Friday evening. Right away seeing Frank's Red Hot on every table was a good sign! The friendly, helpful counter worker described place as a Greek Chipotle and answered questions we had. We ordered an order of spanikopita which was fantastic! Warm, flaky, and savory. Also to start the Greek Fries which we loved. Such freshly cooked potatoes. Son had original lamb gyro, hubby large brown rice lentil mix with chicken and for me the small salad bowl with lamb gyro. The restaurant is very clean, with traditional blue and white Greek colors. Will definitely dine again!"}
{"text":"This was a tough one to review. The restaurant needs a makeover. It is disorganized and dirty. The restaurant had so many flies flying around, I can't believe my husband ordered food from here. With that being said, I was surprised that it was actually pretty good. The gryo was tasty. They are set up like subway. You add whatever you want to the gryo.  The veggies were fresh as well which was a nice surprise.  

I am torn on recommending this place. I would give it 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  
We'd been wanting to visit for a while, and finally had the time.  It's set up as a \"make as you go\" and you can choose if you want a pita, rice bowl or salad.  Then you get to choose your protein and toppings.  Everything is super fresh, from scratch, and absolutely delicious.  
Oh my goodness, it was delicious!  I got the soup, the kiddos (and I!) shared a huge rice bowl and my honey got a gyro rice bowl.  Oh, and we couldn't resist the fresh fries and a side of hummus.  
Firstly, the meat.  The gyro meat was tender and moist, yum!  The chicken was also tender and seasoned well, we all enjoyed that.  We all got the rice with lentils as our base, and it was also yummy.  The pitas were grilled and the hummus was a little more lemony than other places but just tasted very fresh.  The fries looked like they were burned but tasted just fine and were tender in the middle.  We all got the yogurt-based tzatziki (you can choose yogurt or sour cream based) and it too was great.  Overall we ate tons of food and left feeling very satisfied.  Not the \"oh god I ate too much and I've now got a brick in my stomach\" but rather \"Wow, I feel awesome!  That was good and fresh and I just feel...good!\"  And best of all?  We didn't get MSG-snowed at all.  (With the rice and soup I figured if it was going to happen it would have, but nothing!)
I would go back any day."}
{"text":"They closed before they were spouse to. I got here at 845 and all the lights were off and the door was locked. their open till 9 and it's 845... seriously so unprofessional"}
{"text":"I went with my brother and a friend. The staff is very friendly and provide  good service.
 The food its delicious very fresh I had the lentil bowl with gyros, green beans(so yummy) and veggies and half pita. My brother got the fries and the were very tasty.
It was not ready to find the location."}
{"text":"Can't really rate the restaurant, wasn't open at 8pm today. Seems they wanted to close early.

Edit: it's 9pm and already got a reply from the leadership. Still haven't tried it but bumping the rating on principle."}
{"text":"The bowls are excellent. The grape leaves were AWFUL!!! I took one bite and the inside was nothing but cold mushy, slimy rice. Just disgusting."}
{"text":"I took one bite of the grape leaves and spit them out. The rice was gooey and slimy. It was beyond gross."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and had the specialty gyro with lentils and their signature sauce. Overall it was very tasty. You can also get it in a bowl instead of on a pita. I also have had the chicken in which is still good, but as good as the gyro. I a thumbs up for sure on the cleanliness and Chipolte-like assembly line for ordering. The cost was a little high, but worth it. It costs about $9 without a drink to get a gyro or a chicken gyro."}
{"text":"Update:  Went in a few days ago after giving them ample time to get the kinks out.  Unfortunately, they did not.  Food is not bad, but the service and knowledge and experience of the employees is ridiculous.  No one knows what they are doing.  It took the girl over 10 minutes to put rice in a bowl and spread tzakitki on a pita.  By this time, everything was cold, and she had to remake it.  The meat was not ready.  One station is waiting for the other station and they are all standing there dumbfounded.  For most, it's clearly their first job around food.  Everything was cold, portions were small and it is overpriced for what you get.  We get a much better meal at Pita Cafe for half the price and they are not Americans trying to make Middle Eastern food.  They are the real deal.  Sorry guys, I tried, but won't be back."}
{"text":"Yes.  A great small shop in the Market area.  If you are in Greek venue, this is a nice place to visit.  And far better than the $40 a person across the street."}
{"text":"Wow!!! High quality ingredients, large portions and great customer service!!! LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Tried simple greek 2x so far and love it. It is such a great option when looking for something healthy and quick. Everything was clean and fresh. Reasonable portions and prices. Staff friendly. It really is just agreek version of chipotle, which is genius. I will be a new regular here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. The Gyros are good, meat was plentiful and was seasoned well. Fast Chipotle? style assembly? of your Gyro or bowl. Menu is limited but it's worth a stop if you want something quick and not so bad for you.
I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Ignore Jason M. Who obviously can't seem to grasp the  concept of this website. 

No one cares that you were denied a gyro at half past six on a Friday, and it's not a reason to leave a one star rating, you petulant child. 

As for the actual food, it's great. Nice change of pace from the norm in a nice clean place with great kids behind the counter. Don't let some jerk's one star rating deter you."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times.  Not sure why I haven't written a review.
The Simple Greek, as has been written by others is nice, like a Chipotle for Greek, pick what you want and make a gyro or rice bowl with pita, you just pick your protein or veggie and then the toppings...It is fast and simple.
I had a make your own gyro which was fun to create and good to eat.  Had a side of Greek fries.  They slice the potato behind the counter and add spice and feta cheese.  Really good fries.

Really enjoyed my meal.  As I have reviewed there is now a restaurant next door that is similar and Aladdin across the street.  Not sure why the new restaurant moved in next door when the food is almost the same.  Stop by and enjoy a good meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"I had a short bit of time before an appointment and ran in here for the first time. I like that it's not a sit down restaurant, so we were in and out with some delicious food. I got a big salad with gyro meat and was happy that they could customize it so I didn't have to get the feta cheese. It was a fantastic salad! The atmosphere is cute and clean and the service was great. I'm happy to know there is a second location in Market Square and plan on visiting there soon."}
{"text":"A little pricey for lunch, but I really enjoyed The Simple Greek. I had a salad bowl - added lentils, potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, olives, tzaziki, chick peas, feta cheese, wheat pita. So yummy and filling, but light enough that you feel good. We also had an order of the Greek fries which were fantastic - crispy and hot and hit the spot. I wish the prices were a tad lower, but love all of the fresh ingredients. This is basically a Chipotle style place with Greek food!"}
{"text":"Great food!  I'm in town for business and staying at the hotel a short walk away. Definitely a place I will go back to this week!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the 1st time 3-23.
I was pleased with how clean the restaurant was. 
Menu selection of gyro, chicken, and add ons was great.
My food was cold and the soda, and even ice tea dispensers were out of order? 
Hopefully things improve."}
{"text":"Total disappointment... This place WAS going to get a great review. 

I've encountered the Simple Greek three times thus far. The first time was great! They were apart of a delivery service, and it was so awesome to have great Greek food delivered to my door. The chicken was overcooked, but I still enjoyed the gyro.

So... Of course I wanted to order again. I put an order in on Mr. Delivery through the Eat24 app. Typically, it takes some time for actual restaurants to deliver the food, but no big deal. By the time my 'estimated delivery time' came about, I get a phone call from Mr. Delivery... They've called to tell me the restaurant isn't currently taking delivery orders, and my money would be refunded... Okay, I understand, maybe someone was short staffed on the restaurant side or the delivery side. I was disappointed, and still hungry... But not angry.

A couple days go by, and I figured there's no way that hiccup can happen again. So this time I ordered Mr. Delivery through GrubHub. At least they didn't wait for my delivery time to call to say the restaurant will not deliver. 

I guess the restaurant decided to not participate in the delivery game any longer... That's cool, but maybe have your vendor take the restaurant off of their websites, so customers don't place orders. Both times- I prepaid with my credit card and included the tip. Which I normally do since I'm a frequent online food orderer. 

Long story short, I'm out $45, yes $45 until the whole bank processing time is completed...  and HUNGRY! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT ONLINE."}
{"text":"Very surprised with the freshness of the food here. I love more nutritional options they have. I got a small salad bowl and opted out from the rice or lettuce. Instead my base was a kale tomato bean salad, with a load of  gyro, cucumbers, tomato's and their Greek yogurt tzatziki sauce ( awesome). The bowls come with half a pita and they warm/grill it. Overall I walked away surprisingly full and happy. This will be a new go to place on my circuit. Also the guy behide the counter was really helpful and explained everything. I give him especially since I came in close to closing time."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING & I recommend it to everyone!! Chipotle-style creations in which you pick a pita or a bowl and decide all of your sauces and toppings. Hand cut fries that are cooked to order are amazing! And specifically greek fries are always mighty tasty!! Haven't tried the desserts but baklava cheesecake sounds to die for! One day! The employees are always very helpful and patient while creating your meal. Its a great place all around!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to grab lunch during the workday; however, lately the regular sized bowls are being filled less and less. It's reaching a point where the cost of a regular sized bowl doesn't correspond to the proportion of food that you receive and that sparks an issue. My suggestion is simply add a bit more rice or lettuce at the base and it will set the rest of the bowl up for success. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"I like how they prepare everything in front of you kind of like a Greek Subway or Chipotle. Loved the outside seating and the TVs inside. I work downtown so I had enough time to get in and out for my lunch break. I was pretty shocked that a Gyro and Fries was like $12-$15 for that price I could have walked down to Mike & Tony's and ordered 2"}
{"text":"I may not be a Greek food junkie, but I am a huge fan of The Simple Greek! It's so hard to find a quick meal in Market Square  that won't clog your arteries and fill you with regret (I'm looking at you, Primanti's). Although there are times I can eat an entire vat of french fries, it's nice to have an option available that's not only delicious but healthy.

As everyone has mentioned, this is the \"Greek version of Chipotle\" - aka fill up that bowl or pita however you like it. Although I have to pass on the gyro meat, they do not fall short on their vegetarian options. I generally choose the salad for a low carb option, load on the lentils for protein, then top that baby off with a load of veggies and tzatziki. Oh an bonus! You also get two pieces of white or wheat pita. 

Although I love the salad bowls, my absolute favorite item is the greek yogurt. These bowls of magic are the absolute bomb (yes, I said BOMB). You get full reign on the toppings and they have many delicious options you can choose from like almond butter, fruit, and nutella. They're surprisingly very filling for what seems to be a small bowl. I am obsessed!"}
{"text":"This joint is amazing. I always get the bowl with salad and steak. The steak is made to order, very fresh and delicious! You can make the bowl as healthy as your want or as carb filled as you want. I come here at least twice a week during lunch. Top- come before 12 or after 1 when the line is short! Be sure to get the green beans and potatoes as well, delicious!"}
{"text":"While in Pittsburgh, we had to try The Simple Greek, having seen the episode on The Profit -- one of my favorite shows. We already had eaten lunch somewhere else, so we stopped in for a yogurt. There was a line, but it was moving along. A young man took our order and asked another young man to make the yogurt (just one -- we were sharing). Well, it didn't happen, and we arrived at the register before our yogurt and had to step aside while 5-6 people behind us all got their food and went on. Very awkward, and not a good experience. I was really disappointed. I suppose we might try Simple Greek again when we're in town, but that visit will have to go really well to keep us as customers."}
{"text":"The price was good, ready for pick up very quickly, and the restaurant is clean and minimalist but the gyro meat was dry and the gyro itself just didn't taste good."}
{"text":"Ordered Spanikopita .. It was hardly that. It did have spinach and crust but was a gooey mess. Nope won't go back if this is their version of Greek food?! This little thing wasn't worth the 3.75 I paid."}
{"text":"Ordered a wheat gyro pita and Greek fries. Fries soggy even though they were tossed in for a \"re-fry\" and the gyro meat was quite bland, when typically it's got GREAT flavor... not in this case. It definitely needed spicing up, but when asked for any kind of hot sauce I was told \"we had siracha but got ride of it since it wasn't Greek\". However they DO have packets of Heinz57, so.... hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was expecting more. Don't get me wrong, they load the gyro up with meat and toppings but the meat is where it's at. While making it I seen him get the gyro meat that was soaking in I guess water (ew) tastes dry and makes my mouth dry after eating it, had a weird taste. Why wouldn't they use the rack of meat that's spinning behind them? The sauce wasn't that good either. 
I also got the fries Greek style, nothing special, but they were good. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab quality Greek take out for pitas and the faves ex. Spanikopita! We've now added this to our routine after work to grab a healthy traditional gyro with the fixings. They offer whole wheat pitas which are not dry and good & tasty. Tried the dolmates/dolmeh once it is great quality just needs a lil seasoning and olive oil for our more zesty palette. Greek fries are awesome they are raw cut and flavorful not bland. Definitely suggest you try."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far since their Grand (Re-)Opening and I have enjoyed it. I usually have a love/hate relationship with Greek food. I love Greek food but I hate the way most restaurants serve it. I'm not a fan of many of the veggies that usually get stacked on a pita, and while I like feta and tzatziki, I think most places go overboard with them. Thus enters The Simple Greek and their \"fast casual\" approach. (Think Subway or Chipotle, for examples.)

You have the choice of what kind of pita (or bowl) you want, with what meat and toppings. Perfect! And boy do they pile on the meat and fixins! I also tried their dolmades and loved them. They have desserts, too, but I have been so stuffed from the pita that I haven't tried them yet. I will definitely go back and I will have to grab some for later."}
{"text":"I saw The Simple Greek on the tv show, The Profit, and decided to give it a shot tonight.  The menu was nice and simple.  You have the option to get their gyros as a bowl, instead of the traditional pita, which they offer you white or wheat.  They had about eight different toppings to add to your gyro as well. I ordered the traditional gyro, small Greek salad, and the baklava.  The gyro was fresh and the Tzatziki sauce was really tasty!    The baklava was da bomb diggity.  It just melts right in your mouth!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"There's just so much wrong with this place. 
Consistently dry chicken and over cooked gyro meat. 
Stingy with the pita bread; you are required to pay a hefty price for an extra piece of bread to accompany your salad.  
What's the point of a Greek restaurant serving canned dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves)? The filling is gooey, yucky rice...gross! 
The green beans are very bland and not at all like YiaYias! 
It's obvious this place is just too small and unable to prepare fresh beans, potatoes and lentils. These items taste reheated and very bland. 
I appreciate the choice of taziki sauces. But come on...why charge a hefty fine if extra feta is requested on the salad or as a topping on the hot foods? 
Not worth it."}
{"text":"A great addition to the neighborhood! I was just wishing for a Greek place that did bowls nearby and now it's open! 

Fairly small place, although most people do carryout, so there was no trouble finding a seat even at noon. They are very well staffed, although many are still learning. All were friendly and helpful. The food was all tasty. I had a bowl with lentils, brown rice, chicken gyro (a nice option!), lemon potatoes, garlic green beans, village salad, and hummus. The potatoes and green beans are very flavorful and veggies are a welcome addition. My husband had the classic gyro. Must say the pitas were exceptional...soft and fluffy, didn't break apart. The plain fries were also very good. 

I will definitely be adding this to my go to list."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a bite to eat during Open Doors Pittsburgh. There are many restaurants in this little area but the smell of the gyros sold me! It was basically a Chipotle for gyros. I got a salad bowl with gyro meat and all the fixins. The food was good but not great. The seating area was not very clean and that made it hard to find a spot to sit. verall, i was pretty underwhelmed with the experience and would pick somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was a little disappointed with my experience at The Simple Greek. 

The good: fresh vegetables, delicious feta, ample amounts of chicken

The bad: the chicken and the pita both tasted burnt, and the chicken is dry - the burnt taste is so strong that I'm not able to finish my chicken or pita, after only a few bites. Now to find another place to fill me up. I'm also concerned about this strange bitter taste/tingling sensation left afterwards."}
{"text":"Greek done fast casual style (think Chipotle) Food: decent, not great. Portion: good. Snotty teenage girl serving? Acted like I was imposing on her to make my salad. Won't return. If I'm gonna get so-so food with lousy attitude why bother?"}
