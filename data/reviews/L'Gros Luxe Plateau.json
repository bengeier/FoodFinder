{"text":"Je ne recommande ABSOLUMENT PAS ce brunch: salle bruyante, service très long (1h), oubli des commandes, les plats sont secs (pour le prix on ne peut pas trop se plaindre) . Les tables sont collées les unes aux autres a l'extrême et les serveurs sont facilement débordés.... DÉFINITIVEMENT DÉCEVANT"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service and welcoming staff. Would definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, they've decorated well. It's the type of ambiance you'd expect from a plateau restaurant. Good diversity of foods and cocktails, service has always been good for me (been there 4 times). Great for brunch !"}
{"text":"Have been to the new BYOW location on Duluth about three times and I won't be going back.

Overall I'm not that impressed with the menu. I know that they have had their troubles at this location with getting their liquor license and they were forced to do a BYOW with a more \"upscale\" menu, but honestly, the food is just not worth the price. There are so many amazing BYOW restaurants in Montreal at similar price points and much better food. L'Gros Luxe should just stick to what they know.

On the main menu, I've tried:

Try #1
- \"Carpaccio de Tomates\" - ok but $16? It's literally a plate of tomatoes with a bit of cheese. Nothing special here.
- Tataki de Thon - this was good, but for $18 the portion is really small.
- Tacos de Boeuf and Tacos de Petoncles - again, good enough but really small portions. 

The first time we went my husband and I split these and we were still starving. After spending $65 on food I would expect that I'm not leaving hungry.

Try #2 - after the first experience we decided to try to order something that sounded more substantial:
- Croquettes de Crabe 5/$18- these were pretty tasty. No complaints although my friend said his were still cold inside.
- Tartare de Thon $18 - I've had better. The flavours were just overall bland.
- Cotes de Boeuf Braisees $26 - these were good and filling

Overall just felt that the food was ok but really unrefined for the price.

Try #3 - decided to give the brunch a shot since we enjoyed the brunch as the St. Andre location. This experience was really not good. We ordered:

- Eggs Benedit: were supposed to be asparagus and roquette and we added the braised lamb for an extra $5 bringing the plate to $20. The lamb was the highlight of this meal. The eggs were under cooked with runny whites inside. The asparagus, which was the feature of the benedict had we not added the lamb, was overcooked and the whole plate came with one piece of asparagus cut in half. Had we not added the lamb the benedict would have been really underwhelming. 

- Neptune Omelette. $16. The description for this dish is \"Cheese omelette with crabe \"hache\", avocado, fresh dill and salt and pepper. I asked to have the dish without cheese. The omelette came to the table filled with melted cheese. I returned it to the server and was told that there was just \"a bit of cheese in the crab mix\". Sorry but I asked for no cheese - I don't want any cheese - not even \"a bit of cheese\" is ok - why would you even think this is acceptable!??! Why would the kitchen not tell you they can't do it without cheese!??! 

The agreed to redo the omelette for me and had to \"make the mix from scratch\" because I wanted no cheese - ok fine, so I waited for my omelette. Here's what was in it: crab meat mixed with mayonnaise (where was this on the description??) and tomatoes (also not in the description). Avocado on top. Overall the mayo made this dish taste really odd and just didn't work at all. If you are going to add tomatoes, can you please include this in the menu description!?! I'm still in disbelief of the fiasco of this omelette.

The only upside was that our server was really nice and did give my coffee on the house for the inconvenience of the cheese mix up (I didn't complain the second time about the tomatoes - at that point I was just hungry and wanted to get out of there).

Overall I won't go back to this location. I will stick with Mile-End where the menu isn't trying to be something it's not and we've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"La terrasse est superbe. Cependant, il est vrai que le service reste à désirer. Normalement, je vais à celui végé, mais samedi j'avais envie de faire different, donc nous avons opté pour celui-ci. J'ai pris la poutine, il manquait un peu de sauce. Je voulais y mettre du poivre il m'a Fallu le demander 2 fois et je n'ai jamais eu mon deuxième verre, nous sommes aller le prendre ailleurs."}
{"text":"Quick service and great ambience. Wait staff was extremely friendly. The pulled pork was surprisingly good, had it on top of the classic poutine. The poutine was great, curds were melty, and using tater tots instead of fries was amazing. My wife's poutine luxe was great, she throughly enjoyed it. I would go back here in a heart beat. I highly I recommend to anyone looking for a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the innovation here - a lamb merguez pogo or fried chicken and French toast, l'Gros Luxe's revamped brunch menu puts a twist on all the breakfast classics. 

You can get totally hammered here in the morning too - their cocktail menu is still a go!"}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé la place très agréable, j'ai beaucoup aimé le cadre et la bouffe par contre la seule chose que je reprocherais; j'ai trouvé le serveur un peu pushy! L'addition a été déposée alors que je l'avais pas encore demandé! Peut être un petit malentendu mais je recommande tout de même cette place!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Extremely small portions. Waited an hour for a grilled cheese. Bouncer is a rude douche. Atmosphere is okay. Drinks over priced. Definitely not worth going to."}
{"text":"Man, I used to live next to L'Gros Luxe in the Mile End and I avoided it at all costs because it was just so bad. At least the one up there has good service and a half decent atmosphere. I went to the St André location with my hopes up for it to be a little better than the other location and was just thrown under the bus. Firstly, we had two waiters serve us which was confusing for us- and ultimately them too- as they got our very simple order wrong. The restaurant was empty. The fried pickles are the only menu item I would have at the other location because they are delicious and hard to come by elsewhere. This order came up with a flimsy 4 small spears for an outrageous price. I had the burger (with cheese which they forgot to add yet charged me 2$ for) and it was just so bad. The bun was stale. The meat was dry. If I wanted to upgrade to half salad/half fries, they would charge 3$. I asked for salad, they gave me fries. The restaurant was empty so there was no excuse for the crappy service.

All to say, the food is far worse than mediocre, and the prices are not cheap like they claimed when they lured us all in at their opening. They are the American Apparel of food. They lured, they lied and there is no soul to this restaurant, and that makes me very sad. You can tell that all L'Gros Luxe is is a money grab for the owners. This will start showing with less and less customers soon if it hasn't even started yet. I would give them one star if pity didn't drive me to give two. 

I guess the second star can go to the decor. It's cozy, warm and rustic in there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prices and atmosphere. Be sure to try the poutine grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"On était un groupe. Plusieurs plats avaient des problèmes.  Le burger et la poutine de mon chum sont arrivés froids, mon burger coréen manquait de goût,  le sandwich pulled pork  est en fait juste du pulled pork dans un immense pain rien d'autre,  les nachos sont cuits sur du papier et tout est collé sur le papier qui se déchire quand on tire sur les nachos etc.. Il faisait froid aussi dans le restaurant.  Beau décor,  bon service."}
{"text":"\"Chicken\" burger is excellent. Ambience is very laid back and the interior is killer. Everyone was really attentive and positive. I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking for tasty non-meat dishes"}
{"text":"I've been to this location as well as the Mile End one, and I definitely prefer this location! It is smaller, but the people are so much friendlier!

The food is affordable, straightforward, and tasty. The food isn't gourmet or anything but then again I'm no Gordon Ramsay. It doesn't get better for students on a budget, who still want a place with good vibes to dine in!

The people here were super nice, made conversation, and we were even offered free caesars which were definitely a plus! It's cozy for sure, and there's always a wait, but it is oh so worth it. I will always come back when I want a casual dinner and drinks night with friends. :)"}
{"text":"La Poutine est très bonne la sauce goûte bien l'oignon sans être désagréable je prend souvent avec frites en remplacement des Tots que je n'aime pas généralement ! La grosseur des plats est assez bonne et les prix de la nourriture sont assez bas ce qui laisse du budget pour un drink ! (Oki c'est un peu dans leur plan d'affaires aussi)"}
{"text":"OKAY!!!!  My husband and I have recently returned to Canada after 8 years in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.  Honestly, this evening was over the top fabulous.  There were 5 of us and we were totally spoiled all night at the Rue St-Andre location.  Outstanding service from the coolest wait staff.  And the food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  So much FUN!!!  How lucky are we to live in the neighbourhood.  A big thank you!  MERCI!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. I have mixed feelings about l'gros.

Pros: 

Prices - the food is cheap. If you're on a budget, you can actually get multiple food items. Usually things range between 5-12 MAX. So this is definitely a pro.

Interior - every l'gros restaurant gets a 10/10 on their design. They're all absolutely beautiful! The only thing I don't like is how dark it is inside. I guess it sets the atmosphere but I'm a foodie so I can never take a decent food picture unless I come at brunch.

Cons:

Food: I don't find anything special about their food to be honest. I think the only thing I recommend is their Poutine since it's unique (it's made with tater tots instead of your regular fries). I usually add the pulled pork on it to top it off. But other than that i don't usually crave to go back to l'gros. There isn't one food item that makes me wake up the next day NEEDING to go back. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, it's just meh! Their pizza is decent. But why not just go to Parvis to have a better selection for the same price? Their tacos are OK... But again.. Why not go to T&T Taco? Even the burger is meh, nothing special. I'd rather go to Art Burger and for the same price get a gourmet burger that I'll crave the next day. Again, the prices are super cheap but almost every item on their menu is mediocre (minus the poutine) and you can find them at other restaurants with better quality. 

And almost all their food requires you to add either chicken or pork to it to make it taste good which isn't something that I want to consistently do every time I want to order something. I rather have my food taste amazing the way it is without me having to basically build it myself. 

I guess if you're going on a Friday night with some friends for some drinks and food, it's a good spot but don't expect anything special!

{"text":"Great experience with affordable prices this locations is great for a quick drink and chat or for having a light meal. The menu is very flexible and diverse and the staff were great. I had a burger and avocado fries and washed that down with a Hendricks gin. My friend has a Gros luxe Poutine which was great he also added pulled pork."}
{"text":"I recommend the poutine with extra pulled pork and cheese, grill cheese bettra, mojito berrito, and the avocado dessert. This place was packed on a Saturday night and keep in mind that it's a small restaurant, if you want to avoid waiting, best thing to do is to make reservation in advance or call to see if the bar is available. As for customer services, I thought they were fast and really care about my concerns. I originally ordered another dish that was too sour for me to eat, when I told them about it, they were very understanding and replaced my order with something else quickly. If you have never been in this area, note that parking can be very challenging to find."}
{"text":"Me and a bunch of friends came from NY to visit Montreal. We came to L'gros luxe as we had heard good things about it. The service was great, Navid is amazing and provided probably the best service I've had in a while. The food was good and very cheap."}

{"text":"I'm with Danielle K., L'Gros Luxe should stick with what they do well: cheap and delicious food!

I went here with some friends on a warm summer evening.  I was dreaming of air conditioning and delicious drinks, and was a little disappointed to learn they were byob.  No matter, the menu looked interesting and byob can be fun, so we were game to try it.  And instead of a it being a \"luxe\" experience, I found it was pricey for not terribly filling food.  I ordered some tacos and a friend ordered a salad, and as soon as we were done we quickly ordered a plate of calamari to split because there was no way our dishes were going to satisfy us.  Another friend ordered the tartare, and that seemed more substantial, but it shouldn't be so hit or miss.

Maybe it was growing pains (I don't think this location had been open long when we went), but our server wasn't terribly professional or efficient.  The service just seemed way too rough around the edges for a restaurant trying to be more upscale.  

I may be back, because everyone deserves a second chance, but I will know to make my menu choices wisely."}
{"text":"je suis allée au Gros luxe sur Duluth.

C'est super beau comme resto, c'est sur. Pas si grand, mais bien décoré. Les groupes y sont les bienvenus et il y a mille options végé, ce qui est génial ! Les drinks étaient vraiment bons aussi. Mon plat fut très bon (j'ai pris une grosse salade). 

Le service était quand même assez ordinaire, super lent et pas super sympathique. Le resto était passablement vide."}
{"text":"L'Gros Luxe is a really fun place!  Inexpensive tasty food, fun drinks, and a hopping atmosphere!

We were bringing the baby along, so we got there early enough to make sure we could score one of the booths and have our meal before the crowds arrived. It worked out perfectly! We had lots of place for our party of 5 (and a half!), everyone was able to drink something they enjoyed, we picked a bunch of plates to share, and everyone was happy.  And now that I know what it's like, I'll definitely be back with the baby on a calm afternoon, for a coffee and a grilled cheese (or who am I kidding?  more likely a Ceasar!).

I noticed that some of the other reviews mentioned that the food wasn't complicated or fancy.  Nope, it isn't, but it's tasty and delicious and cheap, and perfect for munching while socializing with friends.

I also noticed that the restaurant isn't classified as kid-friendly, and I need to expand on that a bit, because I'm big on bringing my kid all over with me (within reason).  While it isn't kid friendly in the traditional sense, you shouldn't be afraid to bring your kid here either, provided you use common sense.  Don't go once it starts to get too busy, it gets crowded and loud and has more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant and instead go earlier when it's less crowded and calmer.  I didn't see any high chairs, but they do have colouring books and crayons mixed in with the magazines on the rack near the entrance.  There's a kid menu, and most of the regular menu items are smaller and easy to share.  If your kiddo still needs a change table, one of the two bathrooms has a long counter that works perfect as a change table."}
{"text":"Bon service! Mon amie et moi avons commander le burger au poulet frit ( poulet babeurre)! Je ne vous le recommande pas. Il nous arrivait de croquer dedans et ce n'était que de la friture. Je mettrais mon argent sur un autre plat."}
{"text":"Been hearing a lot about this place lately and also seen many post on FB so I decided to give it a try myself. This is a really fun place great music and ambiance. Very hipster bar and the place is small so once full it is very hot in there.
They don't take reservation so when we got there they took my phone number and advised me that I would have to wait about 20 min in the end we waited 50 min and this is the only reason why I didn't give 5 stars. Amazing service the staff is amazingly friendly and efficient.
The beer is good and very cheap, the drink menu is very big and assorted with many choices. The food menu is pretty simple and the portions are small but everything was out if this world good.
I was with a friend and between the 2 of us we tried a few things. We had the fried pickles and they were tasty and they come with a spicy mayo. I had the fish tacos and everything was so nice and fresh, the fish inside are like tater tots so makes it easy to eat. We share the butternut squash soup and it was like butter just melts in your mouth best soup I ever had. She had a burger with mushrooms the meat was well cooked. The best part of the meal was the dessert, I tried the famous deep fried cookie dough and it was an experience on its own. I won't ruin it for you but I will say make sure you share it with someone because it is sweet. I tried the brunch today it was ok but next time I go I will remember that Saturday and Sunday they have only the brunch menu until 3:00pm and the regular menu starts at 3:30pm"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant with my group accidentally, but was very happy we decided to eat here. I got the Burger Coreén (fried chicken & kimchi), and it was absolutely phenomenal. Our food came out quickly and our server, Oliviero, was very friendly and personable. There was no wait for our group of 8, the atmosphere was relaxed, there was a good selection of beer, and prices were cheap. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to enjoy a meal in the Plateau."}
{"text":"Cheap food is a rarity on the plateau. This place is cheap and good. They have a nice selection of beers on tap and have some really cool Bloody Caesars with interesting toppings. Their house beer is also pretty good (and cheap). 

Things to try:
Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese
Pork Tacos
Fried Avocado

They also do a nice breakfast/brunch. The pulled pork hash was excellent."}
{"text":"Really cheap but tasty (5-7$) small plates like grilled cheese & salad, burgers, tacos, and empanadas, including a huge vegetarian menu (get a starter if you're really starving, otherwise a plate and a drink will suffice). Casual but sharp decor-think armchairs and funky wallpaper. Decent drink prices. Often packed around dinner time so you may have to wait a few minutes but it's worth it. Try the loaded ceasars or a signature cocktail if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and both times I liked it. 

It seems like since I quit drinking I've been finding places with the greatest drink menus... Au L'Gros Luxe their speciality are caesars... That are basically a meal. Let me be specific: you have the choice of which libation you want (tequila, vodka, rum, etc.) and if you want a mini burger, grilled cheese, deep fried avocado, vietnamese roll with it... OR ALL OF THEM. It is kind of the best thing ever. (They also have virgin caesars, but I'm not sure if you can get all the treats with it... To inquire within.)

As for the food, I approve of any place that goes out of their way to have a vegetarian specific menu. This restaurant is for omnivores: there is something for everyone. Their veggie tacos are delicious (deep fried avocados, anyone? ok.. let's get serious, deep fried anything is ok with me. But the avocados is what's in their veggie taco). My boyfriend is a fan of their fish tacos and has gotten them every time he's been. We also tried the deep fried pickles, deep fried avocados, and their nachos. Everything was a party in my mouth... Especially the deep fried pickles as they were victorious in winning my heart.  HOWEVER, the nachos were mediocre. Hey, no one is perfect. 

Needless to say, a must for everyone to eat here at least once... Even if it's just for a caesar. They are definitely the highlight of this place.

PS: Also, it's cheap -- and word on the street is that they have a great brunch menu -- but it can get busy and you may have to wait to sit but it's worth it. Enjoy."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Amazing drinks, gluttonous food, not to mention at amazing prices! The poutine grilled cheese may sound like its the strangest concoction ever, however one bite in and your life will be changed. Bourbon lemonade also hits the spot!"}
{"text":"L'grox luxe est un resto au charme fou. endroit bien décoré où l'on peut manger sans se ruiner.
La nourriture n'est cependant pas des meilleures et les quantités sont limitées peut-être est-ce pour cela que les prix sont si bas.
L'grox luxe oui pourquoi pas mais c'est tout!"}
{"text":"The apps that come skewered to the drink aren't not as good as the tacos. The Cesar's are solid though. If you one person orders the big Cesar you can all share as an app and order the meal after. Fun atmosphere and enjoyable service."}
{"text":"J'avais entendu une tonne de bons commentaires sur L'Gros Luxe, mais je n'avais jamais eu l'occasion d'y aller encore. Samedi passé, je m'y suis donc rendue avec des amies. Dès notre arrivée, on nous prévient qu'il y a un certain temps d'attente. L'hôte prend mon numéro de téléphone en note ainsi que mon nom et nous propose de nous appeler quand une table se libérera. Une heure plus tard, nous étions assis et pouvions commander. 

Quelle surprise de constater un aussi grand choix sur le menu et des prix aussi bas... Wow! Presque tous les plats sont 6 $ et les à-côtés entre 2 et 5 $. On peut donc partager et goûter à plusieurs choses, ce qui fait mon bonheur. La serveuse qui avait l'attitude d'une adolescente était plus ou moins professionnelle. En plus de nous raconter qu'elle n'avait pas envie de travailler, elle a oublié de nous apporter notre guacamole. L'ambiance et le goût des plats nous a vite fait oublier ce petit point négatif.

Tout était absolument délicieux, des cocktails à la nourriture. D'ailleurs, les prix des verres se situaient entre 6 et 10 $, ce qui est très raisonnable selon moi. De plus, ils étaient vraiment bons!

Mes coups de cur : les tacos au porc effiloché et la poutine au confit. Quel délice! J'y retournerai assurément."}
{"text":"We had an office Christmas party here last week, the only upside is we had our own private area in the back. The noise at the front was way too much for me.

For drinks, I had a Moscow Mule (way too much ginger), and a Southern Escape (too bitter and sweet). I was not impressed in that regard.

The highlight of the night was the nachos that were super delicious, especially with the added steak ($15+3). Everything worked so well and was looking forward to my Steak-Frites main since the slices of steak here were awesome.

The main was a major letdown, the meat had an off-taste i would describe as sour, the limp fries did not do much to help. There is nothing else on the plate to garnish or look forward to.

At my table, the other person also did not like the steak, the burgers seemed to be good as well as the poutine.

I know there's a lot of hype for this mini-chain, but this is just not for me.

The service was good, nothing spectactular and they were able to supply food and drinks for 20 people with no discernible waiting time"}
{"text":"If you don't get the loaded Caesar here, you're a disappointment. This could've been the coolest item I've ever seen in a restaurant. We got the Caesar that is topped with a burger, onion rings, egg rolls, fried pickle, and grilled cheeses. It's a happy meal on top of a great drink. If that wasn't enough, I had to get the BBQ pulled pork hash over tater tots. This place blew my mind away and if I lived here, I would go every weekend."}
{"text":"Came with a group to have a nice dinner and evening. Ordered the vegan butter chicken curry, and it was very good. Would have wished for the food to be served hotter in terms of temperature and spice. The server was funny and fantastic, made us feel very comfortable. Overall, would come again."}
{"text":"Vendredi soir 8h et il y a une heure d'attente. Par chance, L'gros luxe est devant la jolie Place Roy et à côté d'une épicerie. On peut donc bien attendre dans ce parc sans problème, car nous donnons notre nom à un employé du resto et il nous appelle quand la table est prête :) 

Donc, après une heure qui a passé bien vite, nous sommes assise et commandons à boire et à manger. Je ne suis pas très cocktail, donc je me suis pris une bière L'Gros Luxe. 26oz. C'est gros, c'est de la Pabst, mais c'est 6$ .On se commande les fameuses frites d'avocats. C'EST BON, C'EST GRAS, ON AIME ÇA. Puis les tacos de poissons et Porc effilochés arrivent. Wow des gros tacos! 2 dans l'assiettes pour 6$. Et pour être santé la salade de betterave et fromage de chèvre sur roquette, YUMMY, toujours un plat à 6$ et pas un petit bol, une grosse salade!. 

Bref, ça vaut la peine pour le prix! Je constate dans le menu que les végétariens vont être comblé, car il y a quand même du choix! Les drinks ne sont pas super cher non plus. 

Bref, j'y retourne bien sûre, par contre de ce que j'ai constaté, je ne crois pas que ça soit adapté à un gros groupe, vous allez être tassé. Mais sinon super, et la place est ben ben cute. Le service aussi super rapide. Personnel très aimable. 

Bonne visite!"}
{"text":"Location: The Plateau area. Street parking is available. I *think* Sherbrooke is the closest subway stop, however it's a good walk from the resto to the metro. Totally doable on a nice day, though.

The place: It's got a pub feel to it - dim lighting, bar seating and a few tables. It's cozy and comfortable and I like it.

The goods: I went for the breakfast sandwich. While the menu didn't specify, I think the bread was either sunflower or multigrain... it was great bread but though toasted, it was served to me cold. There was guacamole, cucumber, lettuce and bacon (extra). The sandwich was served with a small salad and baked beans. So, the sandwich was pretty good but a little lacking in flavor (and that cold toasted bread situation). The salad came with no dressing (I don't know if that was an oversight). The baked beans were hot (yay!) and I liked those. Overall, it was a good brunch, but I would have liked the bread to be hot and some dressing with the salad. I also think that $2 for two slices of bacon is a bit steep. 

Service: The host was friendly and we were seated right away. Our waitress however, could do with an attitude adjustment. She wasn't overly friendly to being with and when we were done eating, she didn't give us our bill. All three of us tried to make eye contact - no luck. One of us put on our coats - still no bill. I actually stood up, put all my crap on and remained standing - still didn't ask me if I wanted my bill. I finally managed to make eye contact and asked for the bill. As she was walking over, my friend, who hadn't seen me ask our bills, started to ask for it and the waitress cut her off and sarcastically asked her if she wanted the bill. Frankly, there's no need to be an a$$hole to your clients. Just pay attention to your tables and bring the damn bill when we're done. 

Price point: Fantastic - you can't get cheaper fare on the Plateau! The breakfast sandwich was $5 + an additional $2 for the bacon. 

Would I go back? Maybe, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so unless I was in the area."}

{"text":"Que ce soit pour un verre, un lunch (table d'hôte du midi) ou un brunch, je n'ai jamais été déçue par l'Gros Luxe!
La déco est sobre mais chic, tout est en bois et peint en noir, avec des cadres par-ci par-là
Il y a des grandes tables de 6-8 personnes, dont 2 près des fenêtres, ce qui est agréable
Il y a souvent du monde, parfois un line up
Le menu brunch est excellent et vraiment pas dispendieux (entre 8 et 12$ par assiette, avec la possibilité de rajouter des extras pour pas trop cher)
Le menu table d'hôte du midi vaut la peine aussi (15$ pour une soupe, un plat - généralement un burger ou genre - et un café)
Les jus et smoothies sont très bons, les cafés aussi
Beaucoup de jeunes en mode décontractés, cool
J'ai même eu la chance de discuter avec mes voisins de table pendant que j'attendais mes amies, ils étaient vraiment chill!! :D

Je m'en suis mis plein les papilles !

Si en plus on rajoute que le dimanche les Caesars coûtent 2$ de moins, que l'intérieur est super sympa (ambiance tamisée...), que le service est top et que c'est pas si loin, alors BINGO ! lors de mon prochain séjour, je referai un saut là bas !"}
{"text":"Ma première fois sur celui du Plateau me laisse un peu déçue toutefois leur terrasse extérieure est sublime. Il n'y avait pas d'achalandage flagrant un samedi midi et il y a eu un gros manque de service. Je crois fortement que ce n'était pas la faute des serveurs mais plutôt le fait qu'ils semblaient understaffed. Un manque de gestion, je suppose. 

Somme toute les déjeuners/brunchs sont corrects mais pas extraordinaires. Le menu manque d'options sucrés. 

On a omis de nous servir de l'eau, nos cafés inclus avec les déjeuners et mon mimosa n'était pas la saveur demandée. Par contre, à 3$ le verre de mimosa (avant 15h), ça ne me dérangeait pas trop. 

Nous avons souvent dû interpeller un serveur qui n'était pas le nôtre puisque notre serveur à la base s'est peu présenté à notre table. 

L'avantage c'est que cet endroit ne semble pas avoir de line up (pour les brunchs du moins). Malgré tout, j'irais nettement ailleurs avant d'aller là. Le Plateau regorge de petits bijoux moins connus."}

{"text":"Somewhat pricey food for the quality and care taken.

The chicken & waffles was underwhelming.  The poutine was weird and totally not worth the hype (better poutine down the street and cheaper).

Service was above average for Montréal.

Nice washrooms."}
{"text":"We walked 45 minutes from our hotel to this joint I read about whilst doing my Montreal restaurant research.  Breakfast is a very important meal and this was kicking off our Montreal culinary adventure . So I was hoping I picked a good one.  I knew exactly what my wife was thinking after the long haul. \"If this place sucks I'm killing him !\"  We walked into a restaurant that resembled a little cafe and bar filled with hipsters and 20 somethings. We fit right in (yeah).  It was a bit empty when we arrived but quickly filled up to a wait soon after opening.   Truly a scrumptious brunch; the wife and I both agree L'gros Luxe Plateau is a gem.  We started off with tea and the Bloody Caesar ( a very good twist on the Bloody Mary). Make sure you ask for the special treat on the stick.  She had the Naan breakfast sandwich.  Excellent choice.  I'd give it a 9.  I had the BBQ pulled pork hash, an 11.  So good I almost ordered a second one.  The meal was great and very reasonably priced.  With tip it was forty Canadian dollars.  I'm really sad we won't be here longer because I would go back for dinner.  It looks as good as the brunch.  The 45 minute walk to our next destination was a perfect set up for our next meal.  Bon appetite !"}
{"text":"Wonderful place--charming atmosphere, if a tiny bit noisy--great service and the food was divine. I had an arugula and beet grilled cheese and the house ale. My kids 13 and 16 years old also loved it. Very reasonable prices too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"La nourriture étais Immonde! 
Le service étais long et agressive(manque de patience immense) Un drink peux aller jusqu'à 15$ (tips compris)  bref, plus jamais."}
{"text":"Amazing Quebecois fusion food. Great place to get breakfast! Pulled pork and breakfast poutine is my favourite!"}
{"text":"Les cocktails ne sont vraiment pas bons : trop épicés (comme le M. Miyagi), trop amer (Old Fidel), trop acides (DSK)... bref, seul le Kim Jong et le Berlusconi ont été apprécié à notre table. On a donc voulu partir sur la bière Gros Luxe. Un de nous l'a eu en 10mn, pour ma part je n'en ai jamais vu la couleur !
Les serveurs ont l'air complètement perdu, c'est un beau bazar de gens qui tournent en rond et ne savent pas ce qu'ils doivent faire (et qui oublient les commande : en plus de la bière, nous n'avons jamais eu le bol de guacamole commandé).
Et pour ce qui est de l'ambiance... les tables sont trop petites et éparpillées un peu au hasard dans la salle. Quant à la musique, c'est bien simple, on ne l'entend pas du tout. C'est seulement en sortant que nous nous sommes rendus compte que non, ils ne l'avaient pas complètement coupé.
Bref, grosse déception pour un bar qui avait du potentiel en plus d'avoir la bonne idée d'être à 5mn de tous les amis."}
{"text":"Invité pour un anniversaire au L'Gros luxe j'y suis allé content car je mange rarement végétarien :) 
Très belle accueil du serveur, très amical j'ai bien aimé ! De suite je me suis empressé de prendre un burger végé qui était très bon je dois le reconnaître, ensuite j'ai pris un gâteau au chocolat vegan, malheureusement je l'ai trouvé sans goût je ne l'ai pas finit."}
{"text":"Un brunch entre fille un dimanche 14h, nous n'attendons pas c'est un bon début. C'est cosy, c'est décontracté, ambiance sympa et service cool. 
Ça fait un moment que je veux essayer le brunch du gros luxe et j'aurais du venir bien plus tôt! 
C'est bon, c'est pas cher. 
J'ai pris le Sandwich déjeuner (pain aux échalotes moelleux à souhait, oeufs, tomates, laitue, mayo sriracha et mélange de fromage maison) avec pommes de terre. Le tout pour 8$.Et comme le bacon c'est la vie, et bien j'ai rajouté du bacon pour la modique somme de 2$. Un grand verre de jus d'Orange à 3$ (malheureusement il ne le font pas maison) et je suis en business jusqu'au soir!! 
La prochaine fois je viens pour essayer les fameux Bloody Caesar!"}
{"text":"Excellent cocktail, la bouffe était très bonne. Seul hic: l'attente un dimanche soir, mais n'est-il pas normal qu'un resto soit victime de son succès. Hâte de goûter leur cafe, à refaire !"}
{"text":"Nice resto-bar. The food is cheap and in small portions so order a few items and share. The food itself is not bad for the price but it feels a bit lacking.  The drinks selection is extensive and it's a very hip place to go for dinner with friends. It's always packed so if you're a big party of people then get there early otherwise you'll have to wait for an hour at least. They don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Restaurant hipster, serveurs désagréables au possible. La nourriture n'était pas mauvaise, mais ne justifie pas le prix pour ce qu'on mange. Je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Wonderful and cute little spot for lunch/brunch. The service staff was lovely. They were all so pleasant and nice, very attentive. We had a variety of foods- grilled cheese, eggs benedict and blueberry pancakes. All great! I'll definitely be back on my next trip to Montréal."}
{"text":"Nous avons voulu tester ce brunch assez reconnu dans le quartier, cependant ce fut une énorme déception. Les serveurs ont oublié notre commande, ils ont mis une heure à nous amener 3 cafés dont nous avons dû leur rappeler la commande, idem pour les plats . Ils étaient désagréables et clairement dépassés par le nombre de clients, ils tournaient en rond et ne savaient pas par ou commencer.... Bref je déconseille, nous n'y retournerons pas."}
{"text":"Ambiance cool et décontracte.
Place super cute.
Cocktail vraiment intéressant.
Burger de poisson: boff...poisson pané, mais vieux...j'avais l'impression que ça a été frit quelques heures avant...sauce tartare...encore bof
Poutine végé avec patate tater tots: suprenamment   bon...manque de sauce et de fromage
Fish tacos: correct sans plus.

Over all...bien...est ce que je le recommande...il faudrait que j'y retourne...
Menu: mayo un peu partout...peu travaillé...à revoir selon moi"}
{"text":"I see a lot of disappointed people in the reviews, but I enjoyed my experience!
I'm a long time l'gros luxe fan, my go-to spot was always the old lgros luxe plateau on St-André (yet have to try the 100% végé) 
We figured we would try this one since it's BYOW. The location is beautiful, especially the terrasse. (Which is more like a yard space which is super cute and intimate)
I got the tuna tartare and my friend got the tuna tataki/edamame salad. The presentation was nice and the food was fresh and tasty. The menu is creative and I sure want to go back sometime to try the other items. A lot of people wrote they didn't feel full from the food they ate, but we were satisfied with our portions. I worked a 10 hr shift before going there and barely had lunch and my plate was enough to satisfy my hunger. 
In the end, the food may be pricier but if you're someone who likes to drink, you will definitely save money from your drink consommation. Just pick up a nice wine before you get there and you're all set!"}
{"text":"I can't say it was bad everything was really great but as the majority of the reviews says it was really expensive. I got the poutine grilled cheese and a bloody caesar and it was realllllyyy great the ambiance is much much plateau"}
{"text":"it took us over an hour to get our food. we ordered a side salad and a poutine. do not go here if you value your time"}
{"text":"Concept sympa. Pas mal et pas cher pour manger sur le pouce. Il faut par contre pas arriver trop tard sinon c'est blindé"}
{"text":"This place definitely worth it for their pitchers! I tried bourbon lemonade, which is their best selling pitcher and tonic botanique. Tonic botanique was unique with its violet liqueur while the bourbon was a tasty lil drink! I personally loved the tonic because it was so pretty and refreshing.

Their food is quite mediocre. The nachos I had didn't have enough salsa to eat it with and the mac and cheese wasn't the best I've had. In fact, I think they ran out of macaronis that day and served me penne and cheese. But they have a bunch of veggie/gluten free meals!

I would say this place is good for a nice drink and fun ambience, but the food is nothing special to talk about."}
{"text":"Despite being busy for Saturday brunch, they managed to seat us right when we came in. The food is undeniably good. This place reminded me of Momofuku Noodle Bar in NYC - classic foods made contemporary and still retain their delicious flavors.

I wasn't eating meat this particular day, so I would have enjoyed more options from their brunch menu, but it wasn't a big deal. The flat bread pizza hit the spot and I was good for hours. My friends loved the BBQ pulled pork and fried chicken. Portions are just right - not too little and not too much.

I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The elegant sister of its Mile End counterpart, this spot is the original and baby she's a beaut. $7 brunch comes with a view and what else? Well, I had two eggs and sauteed kale with toast. It was absolutely delicious and the price will have me returning back for more whether solo, with friends or visitors in town."}
{"text":"It's a very small restaurant, but that's what I love about it! The food is delicious. The service is amicable, but slow preparation for the food. The price is also very fair!"}
{"text":"If I were a local, I would come here often. Gros Luxe has excellent food, original menu, great atmosphere and decor. The service is very friendly but might be under-staffed. I loved everything about it.

The breakfast MENU has about ten items. Most are derivatives of classics: grilled cheese, Greek omelette, breakfast burrito, fried chicken with French toast, huevos rancheros and the like. The portions are generous and most items have an option to add meat, cheese or vegetable. The plate comes with a serving of potatoes as well.  I had the Greek omelette with merguez sausage added.

The bar menu is interesting and features classic and original cocktails, wine and a good but not enormous selection of draft beer.

The DECOR is simple, fun and eclectic.  There are probably about twenty tables that are all pretty tight. For a basic lunch, it is a lively place and fairly loud. Fun and active.

The SERVERS are nice and friendly. It was full and the bartender was very busy and the 2-3 table servers were cruising about quickly. That said, the service was prompt.

I'll go back as I'm told the pickles are an attraction but they don't start serving them until lunch (after 3 pm). Interested to see the lunch and dinner options here."}
{"text":"Première fois dans un des établissements du Gros Luxe et je comprends maintenant l'engouement. Superbe décor antique style anglais. Nous y sommes allé pour le brunch un dimanche ensoleillé sur la magnifique terrasse. Apportez votre mousseux, ils vous offre un super mix citron et thé vert pour 11$ afin de déguster votre mimosa réinventé."}
{"text":"J'ai aimé la localisation, l'endroit (déco), l'accueil du personnel et leur travail, mon assiette et le prix plus que correct. C'est assez calme, pas trop bruyant malgré le monde. Un endroit a gardé en tête pour un brunch prochain !"}
{"text":"We came here while visiting Montreal on the recommendation of some friends at McGill, and got a somewhat mixed bag. The food portions reflect the price, and while some dishes were incredible, others left a lot to be desired. We arrived to a bustling restaurant filled with conversation and laughter. The decor appears as if it was lifted from an Anthropologie catalogue or designed by Zooey Deschanel (and not in a bad way!). The greeter at the door was wonderful, accommodated our inability to speak French, and quickly sat us even as he juggles a few other tasks. We were certainly impressed.

Our server was prompt and helpful. We ordered the tofu tacos, tater tot poutine, and the fried enoki with a local Quebec cider. While the cider was wonderful, our opinion of the food was mixed. It took a little while to come out (which is fine since we love hot, fresh food!), and our opinion of each varied. The tofu tacos were INCREDIBLE, and if we were to go again we'd order five of them. The tofu was perfectly cooked and the seasoning was on point! For $3 we got two small tacos, so we should have ordered more! The poutine was alright, although we weren't fond of the decision to replace fries with tots, as the crispness of French fries is what makes poutine such a delight. Finally, the enoki was mediocre, and certainly marred our experience. 

All in all, we recommend this place to others, but I'd be careful of what you order. Stick to the tofu tacos, order some of the more creative options on the menu (the fish and chips poutine and s'mores hot chocolate were ordered at the table next to us and both looked incredible!). Again, portions reflect the price, so go with some friends, order a few great dishes and share them around!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, love the design inside. Prices are really good, only the service isn't what it has to be, I expected more of that. Small prices = small portions, take that in mind. The music is really loud but it's mostly a good thing because it can be crowded so the tables are super close to each other and otherwise you'll loose some privacy."}
{"text":"Première visite hier soir dans cet établissement. J'aimerais pouvoir revenir dans le temps... C'est la première fois que je ressens le besoin d'écrire un review négatif, mais si cela peut sauver un lecteur d'une expérience comme celle que j'ai vécu, pourquoi pas!


Points positifs : 

-Le décor est pas pire, la bière est de qualité standard (yé!), Service rapide. 



Points négatifs : Le sandwich de poitrine de poulet à la portugaise que j'ai reçu. En voici la description en quelques points:

-J'ai rarement mangé un sandwich sur du pain aussi sec. 

-Je laisse le bénéfice du doute à l'établissement, mais je crois que j'ai reçu le sandwich d'un enfant difficile dont les parents auraient fait la demande d'enlever du sandwich à peu près tout (sauce comprise!) sauf le poulet (!!!) et quelques shreds de laitue. (S'il vous plaît, dites moi que c'est vraiment ce qui est arrivé, j'ai espoir!) 


-Déjà là, il y a matière à être déçu, et j'ai pourtant des standards assez de base. Mais c'est à partir d'ici que le party pogne.

-Où ça passe de \"décevant\" à \"insultant\", c'est le lendemain, quand tu te réveilles malade comme un pauvre pitou. Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé en cuisine avec ce poulet, a-t'il été oublié sur le comptoir toute la journée? Manque de salubrité? Je ne sais pas, je n'y connais rien, mais peu importe, on l'a échappé à quelque part. 


Il me semble que c'est assez minimal comme attente envers un restaurant de juste genre, être en forme / pas malade le lendemain. C'était la première fois que ça m'arrivait, et pourtant j'en ai fréquenté des foodtrucks douteux un peu partout en Amérique. 

Cette journée de travail gâchée à avoir de violentes crampes et à tenter tant bien que mal d'expulser hors de mon corps ce sandwich sec et fade aura été mon premier hangover de poulet. J'le conseille à personne. 

Avoir été game pour un empoisonnement alimentaire, je serais allé dumpster. Mais sérieusement, j'me croyais un peu à l'abris de ça dans un resto montréalais en 2017, j'ai été surpris. Mais encore là, j'y connais rien, c'est peut-être quelque chose qui peut arriver random comme ça même dans les cuisines où l'on suit les normes de salubrité les plus rigoureuses.  (mais ça sonne naïf, right?)

J'imagine qu'il y a moyen d'avoir une bonne expérience au Gros Luxe, j'avais pourtant lu de bons commentaires. J'aurais peut-être du opter pour la version végé! Mais bon, en ce qui concerne mon expérience avec le poulet, you fucked up.

¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch!  The Gros Luxe poutine is SO GOOD!!!!!!
I want more!  Price and the portion is on point too!"}
{"text":"This place serves excellent comfort at a price that brings us back a few decades.  Tacos, grill cheeses, burgers and poutines are all delicious.  Sizes are generous and each dish can be customized.  For instance, I had a vege Burger and decided I wanted to top it with pull pork.  Sure that sounds like an Oxymoron... but it's this kind of \"laissez-faire\" and customization that makes this place so damn fun and enjoyable.  

Staff is laid-back and friendly.  Atmosphere is excellent for groups and their waiting area is probably one of the best in Montreal ( they ask you to go wait in the park across the street).

Should you go?  Definitely!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience, delicious food and great cocktails! The staff was very sweet and friendly especially the manager Morgan. Highly recommend this place, thanks!"}
{"text":"Food was lovely. Nice menu and great Caesar. Love the terrace. However, service is pretty bad."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have never had a bad meal.

I went for the Tater Tot poutine and it was super interesting but tasted great. I also ended up ordering a Caesar with a mini grilled cheese attached. Needless to say I was satisfied."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited L'Gros Luxe for the first time on a Friday night around 9:30 pm.

It was pretty dead (strange for a Friday night) and I was annoyed when we walked in and sat at the bar and the bartender working didn't acknowledge us at all (I'm not necessarily a stickler about customer service, but I appreciate it when people make eye contact with me and acknowledge me as a fellow human being.)

The decor was really cute and tasteful and I really enjoyed the atmosphere - music wasn't too loud and it was lively, but you could still have a conversation with the person seated next to you. Besides the bartender, the rest of the staff were incredibly nice (especially the other bartender - he was wonderful ... maybe he was compensating for his colleague's bad attitude), good humored, polite, and friendly. They genuinely seemed to enjoy being there. 

I had a bloody Caesar and my boyfriend ordered their house beer. My boyfriend loved the beer and the Caesar I ordered was probably one of the best I've had since moving to Montreal. 
We ordered a burger, fish tacos, and the tater tot poutine. The food - I thought it tasted great and it came out quickly. Our favorite dish was the fish tacos. The food was decently priced for what it was and I would definitely eat and drink here again. 

Overall, a great experience and I would recommend it as a cool little spot for a low-key night.
Also looking forward to trying the brunch!"}
{"text":"Wow ! Que dire de cet endroit ! Nourriture et drinks délicieux et abordable, staff super gentil et service rapide ! J'adore! Je le recommande fortement !"}
{"text":"Simplicité et bon moment! Un bloody, un grilled cheese et la vie est belle :)
Il ya de la place pour des groupes, pour des amoureux, pour des amis! 
À essayer!"}
{"text":"The restaurant and interior is nice. It's relaxed and classy eclectic, not too kitsch. It's a small space, but they fit in plenty of tables, and it doesn't feel very cramped. However, the music they play doesn't match the feel of the restaurant itself (mostly old school hip hop, and not the good kind, when we went). So depending on your generation/scene, you might either feel awkward/uncomfortable or find it \"cool.\" The menu is in both French and English and ridiculously long physically for their tiny tables.

If you looked at the online menu and thought the prices were cheap, that is because the portions are small. The food is good, but depending on your appetite, you might not feel sated after the meal. When my burger came and I lifted up the top bun, I laughed because the patty was half the size of the bread, and it wasn't a thick patty either. But the flavors were surprisingly good. Not sure if there are enough bites for you to notice them, though. But if you're one of those people who likes to share their dinner meals because you can't finish an entire one by yourself, then at this place this you might just be able to.

The staff is very hipster/lax/aloof, they take their time and get to you when they get to you. So don't expect a high level of attentive service despite the size of the place. You might need to try hard to wave someone down to get any attention. It's a hipster bistro/bar type of place. So if that's your thing, you'll enjoy it. The bartender seemed pretty chatty, so if you'd like to go in just for the atmosphere, there are a few tables along the bar if you don't want a table."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !! THIS IS NOT A VEGAN FRIENDLY RESTAURANT!! They dont care about serving meat to you....\"mistakes can happen \" is what I was given as an apology !!?? Seriously !!! This place is a joke to anyone looking for vegan options !! And from the looks of it , I am not the first person this happens to ...LET ALL VEGANS AND VEGETARIANS BOYCOTT L'GROS LUXE ....they probably run out of their vegan ingredients and mock us by serving us meat thinking that we wont notice !! Shame to the owner, the manager and the cooking staff...as its obvious there is no chef with any kind of pride in that kitchen....I shudder to think about the lack of organization that kitchen must be like !! Uncaring staff and no prideful owner would allow this kind of mistake happen.....HORRIBLE....what if I had a peanut allergy???? Meat makes me extremely ill and I will be sick for days !!! They havent heard the last of me !!!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. 

The place looks like your typical hipster bar that also serves food. 

Typically, the menu includes a lot of comfort food and pretty much anything that goes well with alcoholic beverages. The food was good but not amazing. But for the cheap price, I'd definitely come back. Also, the staff are super friendly!"}
{"text":"We came to L'Gros Luxe as we were dropping off our cousin that lives down the street. We were tired and hungry as we just drove back from Quebec City. I also enjoy eating where the locals eat.

The restaurant had a nice mix of families, students and hipsters. It is pleasant inside and has a cool bistro/bar type of vibe. They have TV's and the NBA finals were on during our visit in June.

Our waiter was very good and our drinks and food came out quickly. I had the hamburger with poutine as a side. It was a very good and tasty burger on a nice brioche bun with Brie cheese. For me it was just the right size, not too big and not too small. At less then $6.00 USD it was very reasonable. 

The rest of our party had tacos and a salad. They liked the Tacos but were more in the good but nothing special category. 

We shared the Earl Gray Crème Brule for dessert. This was also very good.

The L'Gros Luxe gets 4 stars from this yelp reviewer for ambiance, price and service and 3 to 3.5 stars for the food. I would go back if in the area again and try some other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday.  First off, the decor is awesome.  Great spot with character on the inside.  The server was nice but over worked so we saw him infrequently.  Food took 30 minutes to come and it was just for 4 people.  What came for the fried chicken and waffles I ordered was a made from frozen waffle (I know because I get them from Costco) and a couple small chicken tenders that I would guess are made the same way.  We had no napkins and when asked received two for the four of us.  The stars reflect the poor quality of food and the frustrating wait in between times it took for us to be checked on."}
{"text":"Petite place ordinaire pour prendre un brunch. Le service et l'addition étaient corrects."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place. The kitchen is open until 11:00pm so it's a great place for getting a late dinner or just a bite to eat. The menu is not very big but it has a wide variety, and it's vegan and gluten-free friendly. The drinks menu, on the other hand, was big. I got the veggie burger without mayo and a cocktail. It came to be about $23 CAD with tips so it's a pretty good deal.

The waiters were very friendly and made the experience awesome. They were energetic and yes, they were hipsters. The restaurant is a really cool mix of indie, vintage, and modern. It has a great atmosphere, and it's a great place to have a chill night out.

It's about a 5-10 minute walk from the Sherbrooke metro station. I would love to come back another time for brunch."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, had the honey-sriracha chicken wings and Pork Sliders, both great and shockingly cheap (each 5$), and Caesar, which was very good.
Decor is cool and it had a nice atmosphere, warning though its very packed all the time (come for 5:30 to have  a better chance). 
The service was overall quite good considering how busy they were. Definitely worth the wait Id recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"L'Gros Luxe seems amazing - from the branding, decor, and rather interesting menu they seem to have everything to excite a horny hipster with a cool bicycle, but I lost my boner pretty fast. I had the \"Fried Chicken & Pain Doré\", the idea seemed amazing, but the execution was bare."}
{"text":"I hesitated between 3 and 4 stars...
If you are young and like noisy, trendy, crowded places with good drinks and reasonable quality /$ food, then you'll give it a 4.
I for one didn't like to wait 30 min to get seated in a tightly pack, super warm dining area.  Burger was fresh and tasty, but nothing to write home about.  I would have expected more meat for the bun, a more complete even exotic choice of toppings (remember this is supposed to be a trendy place).  Same for the home-made fries: good but plain ketchup or mayo on the side.  Why not a spicy mayo, or curry sauce...
And do bring your reading glasses. under dimmed lights the tiny font menu is almost impossible to read.
Service was very friendly"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night at 9:30pm and the wait was 25 minutes. This place was packed, so it must be good........yes it was good and worth the wait which actually took 15 minutes. 

Eats/drinks:
- BBQ pulled pork sliders (3) each on a pretzel roll, good
- grilled cheese with purine, good
- mojito was good
- sangria was good

Likes:
- price is affordable for the quality of food and drinks
- service was good at the bar even though we had to remind the bartenders several times for ice water
- food was good
- great drink selection some of which very unique drinks

Dislikes:
- they do not take RSVP
- wait can be long
- space is a bit tight inside"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Good place to grab a bite and a drink with say, a date, but be prepared to stay a while. EDIT: spent 45 minutes waiting for food this time, again. Dropped a star.

Food: the food is great and the drinks are good too. Had the bourbon lemonade which was tasty and the karaage burger as well. Nothing to yell home about but it's good bar food for sure.

Service: god is service slow here. Both times I've been here I waited on the order of 30 minutes for food. Also, the staff is not particularly kind here, they're actually pretty aggressive. Had this experience both times and wasn't too happy about it.

Price: fair. Not much else to say.

Ambiance: has an old fashioned bar feeling despite interesting food options. Definitely a good vibe going if that's what you're looking for. The service can do a bit of damage to the feeling though, if you're not here just for quick drinks."}
