{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant so many times heading downtown, and I finally had a chance to try it and was impressed.

I ordered the 2 entree meal ($6.91) with lo mein. For the two entrees I ordered the Peanut Chicken and General Tso. The General Tso was breaded chicken tossed in a deliciously thick tangy sauce. Although I enjoyed the General Tso, my favorite was the Peanut Chicken. The chicken was crispy and tender with a distinct hint of peanut which I thoroughly enjoyed. 

Service was not only kind, but also speedy. In addition, the portions were very generous which is always appreciated in my book! 

QQ Express hits the spot for fast, inexpensive Chinese take-out. Since it's so convenient and tasty, I plan to come again!"}
{"text":"A place that's been around for a few years now. I used to go there with a Chinese friend and co-worker of mine pretty frequently, and had quite a number of nice dishes including steamed egg and roasted duck. Many dishes are greasy, including the 'main course' of stir-fry noodles or fried rice. So despite being a huge fan of noodles, I opt for their white rice for almost every visit.

I find their dishes to be pretty decent actually, though I really wished it wasn't all that greasy. So for that reason I would say select your food wisely, or eat it over multiple meals. Some of the better items I have had in addition to those mentioned earlier are the peanut chicken and their gigantic meatballs. Their beef, tomato and egg stir fry is pretty good too. 

QQ is an alternative to Ginger Root for Chinese food in terms of location, being just across the street. It gives you a wider selection of items at the comparable price. If you are looking for some variation on campus and don't mind the greasy food or the occasional cravings, this is something to consider."}
{"text":"Great place for a really quick lunch and in my opinion MUCH better than Subway next-door. I work nearby, and I often go here because in 2 minutes and for $6 I get a rather  large portion of tasty Americanese food. I also like that the default isn't steamed rice but you can choose from a base of steamed rice OR lo mein or fried rice in case you're not overly interested in the healthiest possible lunch... Which BTW, if you want healthy, maybe don't come here because it's pretty greasy - I'm a fan!

I'd give it 5 stars because it lives up to what it is - quick and cheap Americanese food. However, I think it could have more flavor and some of the dishes could be more spicy. After the first few bites it does tend to get a little one-dimensional. A little soy sauce and some sriracha goes a long way though :)."}
{"text":"What they do they do great. It's very clean and well-maintained. Super cheap and huge portions for college kids. Solid quality food for the price."}
{"text":"They play weirdest Chinese songs I've ever listened to since I was born.
Food is acceptable and location is great tho."}
{"text":"Remember: This is Chinese-American fast food. It is not an exquisite journey of taste into the realms of authenticity. Keep this in mind.

Food: Now then. QQ Express is great for what it is. Compared to other chains like Panda Express, this place is way better in terms of taste (Black pepper chicken = highly recommended). The food is much more home-styled and \"personalized\" in cooking. Large portions are given, and it costs about $6.70, so this place is actually one of the cheapest places to dine. The entrees are very well-seasoned and grilled. It's flavorful, greasy (as expected) and delicious.

Service: Very much like street vendors in China, the service is quick and efficient. Some may confuse this as curt, rude, or offensive, but it is actually just their style to give you fast and prompt service. Do try to not take it personally. Majority of diners here are university students, and the student lifestyle is go, go go, now, now, now; lightning fast service is highly appreciated in this environment. 

Restaurant: The restaurant itself is quite peaceful. There are plenty of white-cloth tables. There is ambient Chinese instrumental music playing in the background. The interior is decorated with simple Chinese paintings, statues, and glass figures. It's a nice place to lounge around. The descent of stairs is a little intimidating, however. When entering QQ Express from the street (University Way), you must walk down a flight of carpeted stairs into the basement of the building complex. Once you get past that obstacle, though, you are greeted by the nice ambiance of the restaurant itself.

Good-tasting food, fast service (almost rudely too fast, which can be a good thing), and the environment is relaxing and serves as a good study area."}
{"text":"Don't confuse QQ Express (which is the University Ave restaurant ) with the QQ Asian Buffet on the North side.  Owner Lin Guo Zhi (who started the northside restaurant but left to start Express) is an excellent chef.  While this establishment has an extensive buffet, we order off the menu.  Ask for the string beans with pork, the hot and spicy chicken ding or the pork bao-zi.  With a large Chinese student body during the school year, more traditional Chinese dishes are available, but you have to ask.  If you know you will be going a certain time, call ahead to try to get a whole steamed fish--as good as I had in China.  Table service gets a little hectic during normal meal times, so if you're going to order off the menu instead of the buffet, it can be a little slow but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap Chinese food. I've only got this when I've forgotten lunch at home and I don't have time to go somewhere better for food. It's certainly not authentic - the flavors are highly exaggerated, but it's not nasty."}
{"text":"Cheap but delicious!
Highly recommend. 
Fried rice tastes good and the food size is real large.

For spicy chicken, it's not spicy. That is the only problem."}
{"text":"Peanut chicken was great. Crispy chicken on the outside, tender on the inside. Delic!"}
{"text":"The peanut butter chicken is my favorite! I wouldn't call it quality food, but for quick Chinese food, I choose this place."}
{"text":"Why is there a sign in the bathroom prohibiting visitors from flushing toilet paper? There's a wastebasket full of poo. Not cool."}
{"text":"This place offers Chinese dishes that many other Madison take out places do not have. It is the only place outside of Chinese buffets that has Black Pepper Chicken (which is delicious, btw) and also the only place that has Peanut Chicken, which is also really, really good. They also have beef and pork dishes, but I've never tried those as the 2 aformentioned entrees are too good to pass up. For $6.70 you get 2 entrees plus a healthy portion of white or fried rice or lo mein. Great lunch option."}
{"text":"This is a Panda Express type restaurant (order white/fried rice or low mein and two main dishes moving down the line and you walk away with a styrofoam container) but with way better food and more of it. 

I have been here many many times and have rarely been disappointed. I'm pretty sure I have tried every dish but my favorites are the lo mein, green beans, and peanut chicken.

During the school this place is packed at almost exactly noon so its best to show up at 11 or a little later in the day (1-2) to avoid the rush.

The staff may come off as a little gruff at times but if you go enough you'll know that isn't really the case. They seem to be like most people, generally friendly but have their grumpy days. So don't be offended if they seem to be hurrying you along.

The food can be a bit heavy/oily so don't be afraid to space out the frequency in which your visit or save half your meal for later (I know how hard that can be!), your stomach may be thanking you later!

Please bring back the vegetable delight with tofu that you replaced with mushrooms! I don't have any hankering typically for tofu as it is a flavorless gelatinous mass, but in the vegetable delight it was very delicious. However, sometime in the past year or so they replaced the tofu with mushrooms and the dish does not taste nearly as good (perhaps they did something else as well...) which is too bad as that was a delicious lighter option.

So in summary, this place gives you lots of food for a good price and is a nice place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot. I was in and out  in under a minute and got a ton of food for under seven bucks! The fried rice and chicken was on point!"}
{"text":"QQ Express is one of my all-time favorite places to go for comfort food.  Their lunch and dinner  meal price is definitely worth it.  However, unless you order off their menu, the food is by no means \"authentic Chinese food.\" But it is great Chinese-American food.  My favorites are the general tso's chicken, thai peanut chicken, and the string beans.  Their portions are super dense and really filling.  If you're not STARVING, 6-7 dollars is definitely good for two meals."}
{"text":"This is an absolute FAVORITE of the UW Madsion Engineeing campus and the students at-large love the restaurant. Not the highest of quality foods, but you get a gigantic and I mean huge portion of food. Personal favorite is the peanut chicken. It's sweet and crunchy and literally covered in peanut butter."}
{"text":"I'd basically given up on good Chinese food in Madison until QQ Express opened up just earlier this week.  During the week, the entree selection offers way more options than you'd see at a some place like Panda Express.   The weekday specials are also very reasonably priced, and offer way more variety and volume for a dollar more than the Subway located next door.  But what keeps me going back is the amazing quality of the food, and the variety on the menu.
The Black Pepper chicken has pepper so fresh it's actually still spicy.  And I've had the peanut chicken 2 out of the last 3 days.

On weekends, they also have Dim Sum until 3pm."}
{"text":"Banqqqing food and they work quick! The Ma Po tofu left a lot to be desired compared to the tastier but greasier alternative at Ginger Root in Union South."}
{"text":"Not too bad for Campus food, which is typical of average quality, with lots of fat and calories and MSG. Be careful when you eat here, be sure to dodge any bone chips or the bonus chunks of solid beef fat and tendon you may find in your meal. Otherwise, its quick and easy food if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"in good price, but serve horrible Chinese fast food. and the background music is so weird. Won't go there again unless I can't afford others."}
{"text":"I generally don't write reviews on yelp but my experience at QQ Express ma worth doing it now. I work nearby and decided to try this Chinese place on an unfortunate wednesday. The food being so greasy made me regret my decision as soon as I took the first bite. Half way through, my stomach felt horrible and I decided I had enough. Maybe it was the combination of the dishes I took that made my experience a horror : noodles * peanut chicken * fried chicken. The taste was okay though hence the two stars and hence the possibility that I may try this place again some time. But seriously guys, take a cue from your rivals ginger root nearby and make the food less greasy."}
{"text":"The food here falls somewhere between bad and mediocre. Every single buffet item I tried was covered in oil. This isn't your typical greasy Chinese food. Imagine taking a plate of delicious fried rice and pouring plain vegetable oil over the top of it. That should give you an idea of what this food tastes like.

There are also no vegetarian options at the buffet, aside from your typical sides (rice, noodles, fried vegetables). They had one tofu dish, but it contained pieces of beef.

I was looking forward to having a place to go for decent Asian food on the west end of campus. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I personally like QQ Express for the price and the various side dishes they offer, while I understand there are some people who hate QQ because they think foods here are unhealthy, not authentic Chinese foods. Just keep in mind that this store is comparable to Panda Express. QQ's just a bit cheaper, and I believe QQ gives you more amount. 

I prefer fried noodles because their fried rice never have the unique smoky taste that you get from authentic Chinese fried rice. Also the rice is very dry. However, side dishes are generally good. My favorite is meat ball and peanut butter chicken. 

Not a lot of people know this, they also do hot pot and it's $10 per person. The amount of meats and other ingredients you get is good enough. But when the store is super busy that it's packed with people, especially during lunch time and dinner, don't expect to order hot pot because they will probably reject it.

If you value price more than the quality, QQ Express is your choice."}
{"text":"A good place to eat if you are a nerd belonging to the Engineering College, only having less than 30 minutes between 2 classes in the noon but get sick of Ginger Roots and Subway. Food is really mediocre and cannot really count as REAL Chinese food. Though, I do like the Curry Chicken Rice there. Also, I do like the sir and the madam who run the QQ. They are very enthuastic and nice people :)"}
{"text":"I brought my family to visit this restaurant after hearing another friend mentioning their Cantonese food was decent, and the result? I don't think we'll go back again. Why?

1. Food

We went for lunch but we didn't order any lunch special, as we'd like to order from the menu and enjoy their 'best possible'. We've been living in Guangdong and know how the catonese food should be. Maybe the expectation was a bit high, the real food was not even close to what I think it should be -- not just the taste, but the main ingredients are missing too. Like we ordered a pot with chicken, salted fish and Tofu, and I don't see any salted finish inside. And they cut the children to slices while it really should be diced for this dish. Very non-authentic! We also ordered 'peppered beef on the iron board', and I see way more onion and green pepper than beef. What the owner recommended was 'Eggplant with fish sause', a quite popular home dish in Caton. They must have used the wrong sause (again, ingredient), so the taste was not authentic either, and it was very greasy.

In summary, the taste of the food was very OK, and the serving amount of on the light side too. Compared to the serving size, ingredient they used and the taste, and price was surely not that great -- about $10-12 for each dish we ordered.

2. Service

We were there for a weekend lunch, and when we got there, we were probably the 3rd table they had. The wait for food was pretty long -- took about 20mins for our first dish to show up, and the last one didn't show up until we were almost all done (and it was too late to cancel that dish). They have about 10 tables so I can't imagine how long the wait will be during rush hours.

Also, the owner/waitor certainly didn't help much during the ordering process -- we ordered 2 similar dishes based on his recommendation, and we had a good amount left over after we were done. 

3. Parking

There is no parking right next to the restaurant, so you'd better have a UW parking permit, otherwise the walk could be long. I can see the students won't mind (as they are used to walk around campus), but if you are bringing family like I did, you may want to keep that in mind.

In summary, this restaurant offers some not-so-authentic Cantonese food that is close to UW campus. It could work well for people around campus who wants a switch from Subway, but not for family who knows how Cantonese food should taste like."}
{"text":"Lets see. Service sucks. Food is alright. Prices are fantastic. Music is weird. What more can I say?

It's not going to be the best chinese food you've had. It's CERTAINLY not going to be served with a smile or a hint of dignity. But you can get a LOT of food for under $8 and it's at least 99% edible (I found a pretty rotten looking carrot bit in the fried rice, but other than that, it was A-OK)

I've been here a few times. Most recently, I had the peanut butter chicken, pepper chicken, and the general tso's chicken. General Tso's chicken was the highlight of the meal and was very tasty. Peanut butter chicken was one of the grossest things I've ever eaten. There is nothing inherently wrong with it - it was just WAYY too sweet and tasted like it was coated in sugar. Pepper Chicken was pretty good. I'd overall recommend the General Tso chicken though - it was very flavorful.

I ordered it over a bed of fried rice - which was almost tasteless. I much prefer it to their lo mein, however. 

Overall - not the best Chinese restaurant; not by a long shot. If you're on campus and looking for cheap eats and don't feel like venturing over to State Street - QQ to the rescue!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest food, but it's something a lot of people just put up with because there's no other options on that side if campus... but at least it's edible. Really oily, the peanut chicken was gross... beef and radish was disappointing... General Tzo chicken, chicken and broccoli, black pepper chicken, curry chicken, and sweet and sour chicken are probably your best bets."}
{"text":"I've always wondered if QQ Express was related to QQ Asian Buffet. But either way, although it doesn't say much, QQ Express is better than QQ Asian Buffet. 

The food here is okay at best. There are more authentic dishes here than at QQ Asian Buffet. And like its all-you-can-eat counterpart, the food here can be greasy, but at least it is really cheap, so that's a plus. The other good thing is that if you're in a hurry, you'd be able to get your meal pretty quick here. The owners chose the correct business name because express is definitely an applicable description for this place."}
{"text":"This shop offers pretty good, authentic chinese food. However, I have to say that  most often the food is covered with oil and I don't enjoy that very much. That's really a turn off to me but it has not stopped me from going there for express lunch."}
{"text":"After what felt like ages working on a project, we walked our of CS to go get a sub. But I realized I needed something hot and spicy on this frigid and windy evening. And also cause I was super hungry. So we went to QQ. And boy was it hot... and spicy... and filling. I couldn't even finish half of my plate! Pepper chicken has to be the best option there. Didn't really buy into the Peanut Butter Chicken. Almost akin to pineapple on a pizza. 

It didn't taste bad, actually it tasted pretty good but boy did it make me loathe myself afterwards. All that oil and sodium...

Go here if you're hungry and want a quick greasy meal."}
{"text":"Cheap, a ton of food, and fast- that's why I will keep coming back to QQ when I don't pack my lunch. Even when it is packed with the student lunch crowd, I can be in and out within 5 minutes. Don't' expect niceties and sweet hellos.. more likely you would be yelled at \"next dish\" to select what you want next, but it is okay- fast and efficient! Servings are huge. I'm a small eater and a QQ lunch serving of two dishes + rice/noodles can last me 3 meals. Food is okay, greasy Chinese food, the kind that tastes even better the next day. I like the black pepper chicken, and egg plant dishes a lot."}
{"text":"It's good to have another place to get a quick lunch around that part of campus, if anything just to avoid having Subway every day. But the food is only OK. There's two or three things I like and they're quite tasty, like the General Tso's chicken and the black pepper pork, but otherwise the options are lacking, and their beef and their seafood tend to be too chewy. Overall, an upgrade over Coreana, the restaurant that used to be there, which had some good food but terrible service, so it took ages to get lunch."}
{"text":"My mistake. I thought this was the QQ on Sherman Ave. I have never been to this one."}
{"text":"Decent fast inexpensive food.  Large portions. Good value. It was cafeteria style so the service is fast. The lo mein was pretty good. The general zhos chicken was OK  (small chicken, big breading). Pepper chicken and bbq chicken good.  Not fancy but fills you up."}
{"text":"If I were ever going to write a one word Yelp review, it would be right here, and that word would simply be \"Eww!\". But I won't do that here.

The one time I went to QQ, it was on a Friday night while I was doing late night grind for my job. I needed some edible fuel, and remembered that QQ is the closest place that's actually open and isn't Subway. So I go down to the steps, and come in and see a nearly empty restaurant, with two employees just staring me down. All of the food was before me, as it was just in heated trays, much like what you would see in a food court. At this point, I was considering walking back out to the surface, but figured I may as well trudge on, since I have no other options. So, I look through the options, and come to find that as a vegetarian, I have one option: The tofu. I ask for it to go, and get it in the usual plastic bag and styrofoam box. When I get back to my office, I look in the bag, and a large portion of the sauce was just seeping out of the box, onto the bag, and soon after my desk. I get that mistakes happen, but still, it's a bummer.

Now that I have the food and am situated, I start eating. It doesn't take me long after to chuck 3/4ths of my meal in the garbage. The tofu tasted so slimy and bland, even with the MSG filled sauce packets, and it smelled slightly rancid. The noodles that came as a side were really stiff and dry, like they were cooked for maybe a minute. It takes A LOT to get me to throw non-spoiled food away, but QQ managed to do the unthinkable. Hats off to ya QQ, because I might've needed to vomit in said hat if I actually finished that meal."}
{"text":"There's this movie called Big Trouble in Little China. Kurt Russell plays a truck driver with a mullet and a best friend that owns a Chinese restaurant. I know the movie is set in 1980s San Francisco Chinatown, but I like to think that it's actually QQ Express.

QQ is quintessentially Chinese American. This isn't the Chinese American at the mall, but Chinese American with loud ladies yelling \"next?!\" over and over through a busy lunch service. There are steam trays full of food, but they're constantly being emptied and refilled. It's not appealing to Americans. They are unfazed. The lunch line is full of fobby* kids and engineers. None of them care, or, if they did care, knew how to express it.

The food is kind of the same way. Chinese American. I watched a youtube video about Asian parents complaining about things. \"American food is too sweet\". This food is definitely too sweet. I wonder if someone in the restaurant could put together something amazing, but since I only have thirty minutes between classes, I will never find out.

*Sorry"}
{"text":"Updating again: Visited for the first time since my previous review in October and I think I am done with QQ express as I once again got a weird dish- the black pepper chicken was hard as a rock. I am also consistently turned off by the rude woman who works here and rushes you through the line. I'm sad to say I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"The food is technically okay here, but it's nothing amazing.  I've ordered a few times here just because it's close to my office on the west side of campus.  I've never been impressed, nor have I been utterly disgusted. 

For lunch, here's how it works:  This place is downstairs beneath the building that houses Subway and The Library bar.  The only entrance is along University, which leads you directly to a stairway and the basement.  You then enter a pretty long line and are served cafeteria-style.  First you choose if you want rice or noodles, then you choose 2 items off the buffet.  They're pretty clearly marked, which is a good thing.  After you are given your items, you pay $6.70, and either sit down at a table or take your food to go.

I tend to stick to the chicken items, as the texture of the cuts of beef they use is not the greatest  Also, vegetarians beware, as I'm pretty sure the ma po tofu has bits of meat in it.  The noodles tend to be a bit greasy too, but the rice options are okay.  They also have the deep fried Chinese mainstays of sesame chicken and the like.  

If I were just grading the service aspect of the restaurant, I'd give them 0 stars.  Service isn't as important as food to me, especially when I'm taking the food to go, but every time I've been here I don't really even feel welcomed or thanked because the cashier makes no eye contact nor says a single word to me.

The first time I arrived was during a busy lunch period, and there were two women working the front line of the restaurant.  The first woman took my order by barking \"noodle or rice!\" and then, \"2 item!\", and once I chose my food the second woman took my credit card and handed it back to me with my receipt without saying a single word or making eye contact.  Today I visited and was served by the same person because it was not as busy, but yet again she made no eye contact and did not say a single word during the transaction.  I don't expect great service, but at least say thanks when I patronize your restaurant?  You'd probably get another star."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food spot on campus. I don't even bother with ginger root. This place just satisfies my chow mein fix and there's always no issues with blandness which I tend to come across in other restaurants in this same category. It's also a really good price for the amount you get! 4 stars only bc sometimes food isn't as fresh as I'd want it to be."}
{"text":"It's cheap Chinese food.  It's around ~7 bucks for easily 2 meals worth of food.  

Some poor mistaken souls think they're going to feel great after eating here, or expect the servers to leave them emotionally full and happy.  That's not going to happen.  What can happen is you'll get a ton of food for a relatively small amount of money.  They do everything I expected in a relatively nice and clean restaurant which is why they're getting 5 stars.

(For context I usually eat fried rice/tso's chicken or something else meat-based, and then steal an extra fortune cookie for myself before leaving.  I haven't tried many of the other dishes)."}
{"text":"Ugh this place is dreadful. I know, I know, this is supposed to be super-fast, cheap, Panda Express-level Chinese food, but you have to have a minimum of palatable that QQ does not reach. My biggest problem, and the source of my most confusion, is why the food has been sitting under the heat lamp for so long. I'm guessing it's because they make food in huge batches. But why? Your business is not so good that you need to make that much food, and making so much food at once brings about two problems - 1) the food sits too long under the heat lamp so it dries out, and 2) flavors just go out the window when you physically aren't able to attend to all the food you're churning out. Maybe the dry food is why they have a tray with large cups of ice water, expecting you to need a cup. But even with the water, I could only suffer through half my order before I gave up masticating and threw it out in disgust."}
{"text":"I tried QQ for the first time, having a vegetable medley and ma po tofu.  I've never had ma po tofu before, so I have nothing to compare this dish to, but I found this flavorful with the squid cooked nicely.  The fried rice was a bit soggy.  My lunch cost about $7."}
{"text":"Excellent food at an even better price! I'd recommend the black pepper chicken and the General Tso's. I opted for lo mein over fried rice, and was pleased it wasn't as greasy as other place's tend to be. It's a cute little space right on campus, and I am happy to have finally tried it out!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. It is exactly what you look for sometimes. Cheap, fast, greasy Chinese take-out. I am very impressed how they prepare for the lunch crowd rush. I came in with a group right before the lunch rush. They have a table of waters prepared as well as silverware, napkins, etc. 

I had the lo-mein and two types of chicken here and it is exactly what you expect from a joint like this. Extremely greasy but flavorful chicken. I was surprised that the lo mein was not as greasy as I was expected and was almost dry even. They do have a lot of options though so it's a great, visual and fast way to get food. 

I can tell it's a popular place and offers exactly what college students crave sometimes. I think they have a well organized place. It's unassuming and I wouldn't expect to get a seat here if you go during busy hours. Portions are large and I will definitely come back for when I'm craving this type of food."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a reasonably-priced Chinese place near campus in Madison for quite a while and I'm glad this place showed up.  After going to all the other places, this is definitely the best.  They give large portions, the staff is nice, and the quality of the food is great.  The Mapo Tofu and the Chicken and Broccoli are my favorites.  I'm really happy the Mapo Tofu actually has pork in it, unlike the low-quality vegetarian crap offered at other places.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for realllllly good Chinese food this probably won't be your first choice. But if you're a college student on a budget, like I am, you're going to LOVE this place. They give you SOOOO much food for really cheap, and it's definitely better than the dining hall Chinese food. 
I get the General Tso's chicken every time. It is so good, and I always have some leftover for the next day. 
The service is always quick and friendly. 
This place is the perfect college student restaurant!!"}
{"text":"It's the new Chinese fast food buffet that took over Coreana's old space. As a transplant from Hawaii who is very used to quality Chinese food, I've been SUPER disappointed in the Chinese food in Madison. Not to mention as an employee near this establishment, I've been bummed at the lack of decent lunch options. SEARCH NO MORE. This is the best mediocre Chinese food I've found in Madison. It's not the best ever of Chinese, the rice was just a tad under-watered in the cooking, my friend who had the noodles wasn't super impressed... but the entrees were just fine. Price is very reasonable. I'm happy they're part of the neighborhood. =) They're definitely better than Coreana, whose food sucked, imho."}
{"text":"I think when you go to a Chinese fast food restaurant, you know what you're getting yourself into.

Perks:
-always very nice customer service when I've been (although I can't say I'm a regular by any means)
-giant portion sizes for the price

Downside:
-it's Chinese fast food...

Overall, I have respect for this place. I have a more sensitive GI situation so I'd rather get a sandwich at Subway next door, but I get the appeal of this place completely. If you're looking for easy, fast, cheap, a lot of food, you'll get it."}
{"text":"The food was terrible.  I have never gone to a restaurant and ordered 2 different dishes because I'm super hungry and need to eat something.  I ordered the first meal and it was not tasty at all.  I tried adding soy sauce and still nothing so I had to order another meal.  It wasn't that great either but edible.  I informed the waiter in a polite way about the taste and my reason for ordering another meal.  Any good restaurant would have at least took the first meal out of the check but they proceeded to charge me for both meals.  I paid and left.  I will NEVER come back here or recommend it to anyone.  There are 2 other Chinese restaurants right next to it, try them instead."}
{"text":"Five star straight for good food, sometime service is good too. It's more like hit and miss for service, most of the server there are just careless, but one server is really good. Their appetizer is good. The important part is not to order noodles there I have tried 3 noodle soups there already but so far no luck yet, so try at your own risk. The beef roll is the bomb, the onion pancake taste good too, and I like the pork rices serve with egg. Dumplings are normal."}
{"text":"Note to self: do not under any circumstances eat at QQ Express.

Not even if you've got a craving for Chinese food, not even though it's quite affordable, not even though it's a closer location than some other options.

I've eaten here twice. I've felt terrible after each time. 

0/10 , do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is pretty average as far as Chinese food goes. I did the pick two and got the black pepper chicken (5 stars) and the mapo tofu (1 star) - the chicken was warm, crunchy, spicy, and great for my lingering hangover from two days before (I'm getting old), and the tofu was cold, flavorless, and a bit slimy. If I can recommend anything, it's stick with the meat dishes. It's a clean and beautiful restaurant otherwise with average service and very well kept restrooms."}

Admittedly a fat-packed grease fest, QQ will disrupt any sort of diet you have going on. But when they serve up this mean of a peanut chicken, there's no turning back.

Yes, the workers are impatient or, put more kindly, efficient, but this is often a plus on days where I'm looking to grab a quick bite between classes. 

In terms of the food, my favorite is for sure the aforementioned peanut chicken. It's deep fried chicken that's then coated in a strong peanut butter flavored sauce, so what's not to love. Also classic QQ is the Ma Po Tofu. I appreciate tofu preparation at places like these considering I am a failure at making it taste good at home. Their version is a tad spicy and certainly hearty in the protein department. 

They're generous on the portion sizes, and the food is cheap and stick to your bones tasty. QQ, you've got a fan."}
