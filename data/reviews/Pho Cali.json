{"text":"The BEST coconut smoothie's in Charlotte!  All ingredients are fresh...you can taste the coconut. Yes, it's my favorite item on their menu:)  Everything I've tried so far is excellent: *Fresh Summer Rolls (not dry, still sticky) *Seafood w/Rice Noodle Soup *Vermicelli w/Grilled Shrimp, Pork & Egg Roll *Stir Fried Seafood Combination *Chicken Hai Nam, Pineapple Rice topped w/steamed chicken served w/ginger fish sauce *Grilled shrimp, Shredded Pork, Steamed Pork cake, Grilled Pork w/fried egg & white rice  The staff is friendly and helpful in explaining the different types of food available. I've been trying something new every time and I always ask them for recommendations and so far so good!  Food is tasty and priced fairly.  I'm happy they opened in this location because they're the only Vietnamese restaurant in this area - close to my job and an easy drive to on my way."}
{"text":"I finally tried out Pho Cali, to go, although I didn't get to try their famous pho I was advised by the cashier to try out his favorite item on the menu. Which is number 43 I believe, sticky rice an roasted chicken an kimchi as my side. It comes with a brown sauce which I use to dip my chicken in an I drizzled a little bit on my rice. The chicken is seasoned an roasted to perfection. The sticky rice is fluffy an good. The kimchi is just how I like it. I went with my bf who had already ate an as soon as we were leaving the parking lot I began to eat, everything looked so good we ended coming back a second round because my BF wanted his own tray lol."}
{"text":"I work 5 mins up the road and go here for lunch all the time or usually pick it up to go.  Never disappointing!  I usually get the beef noodle soups or the bowls.  Haven't tried their seafood yet but from what I hear its pretty good!"}
{"text":"They need to change their menu. They offer shakes, but never have the ingredients. They offer roasted chicken, but never have it for the days we walk in. This is the fourth visit and it's the same excuse. Change the menu and stop advertising other plates if you aren't willing to serve it."}
{"text":"Very dishonest business. Miscellaneous charges so please ask for what you are being charged for!  Especially for large groups. We had a large group come to eat, was blessed by a friend who wanted to pay for everyone so he did discreetly while we were all in the middle of our meal. At the end of dinner, the waitress brought the check(again) to a different person who wanted to pay (he didn't know the bill was already paid).   Our table was charged twice. Both checks were of different amount. Either an employee is pocketing money or this is how they want their business carry out. Their receipt isn't itemized so you don't know what you're being charged for exactly.   We won't be back even though some entrees are really good. VISITING PATRONS BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Finally I try there pho last week. The pho is really good. But, if I have a choice I don't want the guy to give me a service. I came in last week two guy were working. I think they like to play on the phone more than giving customer services. Last time I came the girl working there giving me a great customer service. I think the owner have to tell the guys how to be a great customer services. They do bring me everything. Like water, vegetables, after that they go to the cashier on the phone, when I try to raise my hand for the check no one looking at. They looking down. I think I will Came back and try there new item."}
{"text":"We were craving peel and eat shrimp after leaving the Louisiana spring festival at OMB. When I entered peel and eat shrimp in yelp, Pho Cali came up as an option. What more can we ask for? Pho and shrimp? Yes please! We ordered a large bowl of pho tai and bo vien and 2 pounds of shrimp. The waiter tore a piece of paper to cover the table and bought over a bucket with a roll of paper, 2 bibs and gloves. This is the first time I  was given a pair of glove to eat shrimp. The pho came out first. It was quite delicious. The waiter came over with a plastic bag wrapped in another plastic bag that held our lemon pepper shrimp. The shrimp was seaming hot. The flavor was peppery with a hint of lemon. Shrimp was a good size. I have never been so happy to be wearing gloves while eating shrimp. My hands weren't as smelly as they could have been thanks to the gloves."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good!  Love the house special pho and the rice plates! I just wish they give me more of it!!!! The service is pretty good and reliable. My family went here a few times and they would love to eat it when they have their cravings for pho."}
{"text":"That. Seafood. Tho... Mmm! I was hesitant to believe the seafood hype I had been hearing and reading about this small, unassuming Vietnamese spot. But the hype is real, their \"House Special, medium spice\" sauce is THE BEST, It's better than flaming crawfish, it's better than kickin' crab in San Jose, CA and it's better than my husband has tried to make at home. Also the fried calamari was delicious! The sweet potato fries were a hit, especially for dipping in extra sauce.  They have great specials every day, some where you get an entire extra pound of shrimp/clams for free when you order the special combo of the day. So call ahead to find out the daily discount available. The only lame part of the experience is that portions are small, for everything.. So we ended up needing to order double to feel satisfied and the price they charge for extra corn/sausage. It's around 75 cents per piece! Delicious but it's gonna cost ya to be full!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean. The aroma smelled fantastic! The young lady who took my order was very pleasant. I ordered the Bun Tom Nuong (vermicelli with shrimp) and unfortunately was not pleased. The shrimp had to be small shrimp but they were butterflied to seem bigger. The shrimp also had no seasoning on it whatsoever. It seems as if they steamed the shrimp and that was it. I have been to other establishments, like Vietnam Grille or Saigon Palace that cost around the same price but give you large seasoned grilled shrimp. I wanted to try this place because I like trying new places and this was closest to my job. I would have returned the dish but I only had a 30 min lunch break. Until they improve the dish, I'll stick to what I know."}
{"text":"Good pho, great coconut milkshakes- actually the best coconut milkshake ive ever had."}
{"text":"Obviously I was ordering the wrong thing. Had the Pho with beef and tripe and it was great. Tripe was chewy velcro but meh, what can you expect from innards.  Broth was a little under seasoned but plenty of condiments to fix that. I'm going back to work to nap."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd ever try this place again after my first time - though the pho was good, the service was nonexistent. However, I had the good fortune of getting a job around the area and gave it another shot:  it became my go-to for days I had time for long lunches as the service and pho both drastically improved. My girlfriend and I shared so many meals here to point that the staff just brought out our usual when we showed up: 1 regular beef pho + 1 large beef pho with extra tendons. Pho Cali is definitely one of the things I miss most about working near Whitehall / Ayrsley."}
{"text":"This review is for their new seafood menu. Heard a lot about this place lately. Similar to flamin restaurant recently closed down but more flavors. Great addition to the neighborhood. I found my place! Just need to find a great dessert place. My friend and I tried out the house special hot and it was delicious. Hands down the best sauce I've had. They definitely see me again. Strongly recommended for seafood lovers!"}
{"text":"I didn't have a spectacular experience here, the food was ok, but not great. Service left a lot to be desired.  Read more at: http://eatitcharlotte.com/2016/04/18/pho-cali/"}
{"text":"I must say that Pho Cali is one of my favorite places to eat lunch with friends or family. Also a nice selection of seafood. You will enjoy the taste of Pho most of all."}
{"text":"I just threw away my lunch from Pho Cali because it was inedible. I ordered the Charbroiled Lemongrass Chicken & Rice. The menu had little description of what this was. I expected something completely different than what I ordered. I opened my lunch when I arrived back at work and there was a large blob of plain white rice with some chicken. The chicken was ALL FAT. It looks like they took the worst parts of dark meat that they could find and cooked it up and stuck it next to the rice. I will not be back to Pho Cali. I'm very disappointed at my $11 lunch that I wouldn't have fed to my dog."}
{"text":"Ok place. Got excited about a close place for pho. The meat used is odd tasting. Vietnamese Grill is far better and worth the drive."}
{"text":"*Me and friend eating* Waitress: Are you done with this? *pointing at a plate* Me: No we're still working on it. Waitress: *Grabbed it and walked away*  *Me eating again* with empty bowls and plates on the table and that waitress never came back and checked until we're almost done. Good Job Girl. But the crawfish was really good, we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho and crawfish I've ever had. I enjoyed the original sauce on the crawfish- medium spicy. Definitely a lip burner! Not too spicy for me; had so much flavor. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decent typical Vietnamese pho restaurant. No much of a wow factor. Location and parking is not good. Food was an okay at most. There was only one server at dinner time and business was slow. Had their large pho special with all the meats for $10.50. Filled me up too. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"We have the combo seafood platter with crawfish.....Amazing!  Do the house blend sauce with Average spice level, ours was too spicy and we ordered Hot.  I can't wait to try the Pho next, I have heard great things."}
{"text":"First time ever to a vietnamese restaurant. Waiter spent time explaining common things they have.  Very clean. Plenty of seating. Nice decor.  Had #24. Vermicelli noodles, grilled shrimp, bbq sliced pork, lettuce, julian carrots, bean sprouts, julian cucumbers, red peppers.  ALL in one big bowl. Several sauces to try. Fish sauce with julian carrots. Clear tangy tart. Couple hot sauces. Hoisin is thick & sweet. Typical soy sauce.   I enjoyed. Will be back."}
{"text":"Very good seafood but a little bit pricy for the amount you get. Customer service sucks and I've  been here several time to see if customer service would change since I love their seafood but service still the same and it seems like I always have to ask for my drink or a refill. I would still come and order but don't expect to have good customer service!"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck, 2nd time coming to this restaurant and I can't expect any better. The food is served fresh, hot and delicious. Atmosphere is calm, music is soothing; especially on rainy days. The pho is what I came for this time but fell in love with the spring rolls. The peanut sauce was just right! Will be returning here soon..."}
{"text":"So disappointed. We hoped to find another option for pho and bun vermicelli and was quite disappointed. There was no one else there but us. It's the Grand Opening and we were hoping for a good meal. Wow. No bubble teas. Only smoothies. The menu items are very limited ... Only 4 pages (2 total front and back) of options to choose from.  The pho was not aromatic at all. Yes, bland as the other reviewer stated. The prices for pho were average. My husband ordered a large Pho Dac Biet and with a good pho soup broth, you need not add anything but spiciness if needed. This bowl needed fish sauce and way too much hoisin sauce and the color was just of water. No rich broth.  The Bun Vermicelli with pork was not good. The lettuce was cut too roughly (large) making it difficult to eat. There was little pork and the pork only tasted of sugar. No savory aromatic shallot and garlic flavor.   We will never go again. This place will not last. We are Asian and we love Vietnamese and now that we have scratched it itch to try it, we will not be back. Food is everything! Although the service was good, the food would not even be considered mediocre. It was NOT AUTHENTIC AT ALL and no matter how good service is, it is not enough for us to go back. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The pho is really good. Be careful though, their jalapeno peppers are really spicy but add a really good kick to the pho. The small pho is pretty big. They give you alot of broth and alot of meat and noodles. The resturant is clean and even though they appeared to only have one waiter tonight, he was pretty cool."}
{"text":"I've had pho all over Charlotte, and I believe that broth makes the bowl.  Pho Cali has consistently had the best broth, and in turn the best pho.  If you know your soup, check this place out."}
{"text":"Strangest thing happened here.. I don't know if I'm losing it or have been so sick lately that I'm just out of it.. I needed some soup. My family wanted pizzas. Ummm no. So we pick this place. I opted for Pho.. I ordered no# 1 which is summer rolls and no# 41 which is grilled pork with poke ground pork with eggs and among other things for little man. The main Man order something with chicken, which he likes!  I'm ok with my pho.. A little bland but I wasn't sure if it's just me since I been under the weather..  But little man's food was all out of wacked. The summer rolls turns out to be fried spring rolls, which I nodded too.. Don't know why.. And his dinner is a no# 40 which is originally suppose to be #41. By the time it arrived. All the food is out.. So I don't feel like sending things back.. Little man  have to deal.. The main dish he had has nothing but cut up grilled pork and 3 pieces of half shrimps. I tried the shrimp. Meh!! The pork pieces was also ok.. He didn't finish any of it.. The fried rolls was too oily.. I didn't know why I wrapped it to take home.. He won't eat it later..  Customer service is ok.. I have to look at her a few times to get her attention.. I'm hoping to go back again so I can update my review.. Because I can't believe the orders can be that out of wacked when I'm telling her just the no# and not the full name. I know I won't even try because my Vietnamese sucks.. Why torture the poor girl!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Went there for lunch with my buddy and waited 30 min for our food. Even the two couple that came after us got theirs first. Looks to me like the waitress know them so she gave them our food and have us wait. As much I I love pho, I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in shortly after the lunch rush for some pho.  My friend and I both ordered the beef pho. My gal pal is new to pho and she loves this place. I've been eating pho for awhile now and this place does it solid. Broth tastes great, just thought it lacked slices of meat. I'm not a huge meat eater anyway, so it doesn't bother me as much as it might some people.  Jasmine tea in a pot is always a score!   Staff was pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends that visited from out of town. My first time trying any Vietnamese food. I had ordered Pho with meatballs and some beef. As I was skeptical to try it, it actually wasn't that bad. The meatballs were not what I thought they were going to be so next time I would order Pho without it."}
{"text":"This is a decent little Vietnamese place in Steele Creek. I typically go for lunch, since it is just down the street from my office, and it is quick & affordable. I am not a huge pho fan, but my coworkers and friends really like them here. I tend to go for the vermicelli bowls (shrimp is my favorite) or the roasted chicken with sticky rice. Everything is always hot and is served quickly. As other reviewers have stated, this place is not going to win any points for ambiance.There is an empty lobster tank with a sponge in it right in front of the desk, their soda fountain is broken but still taking up an entire corner of the restaurant, and they keep their washable chopsticks in containers (exposed) in the middle of their tables. And there is typically only one waiter during lunch. BUT, the food is really consistent and good, and this area in general needs less chain restaurants and more local dives."}
{"text":"The pho was really delicious and the meat so tender  The staff was also very polite and welcoming so im definitely coming back"}
{"text":"The summer rolls were all thick chewy rice paper. Very thinly sliced shrimp. I asked for no pork and would have thought I would have gotten more shrimp or at least thicker a half or whole shrimp pieces. No, only paper thin slices. But the rice paper was so thick I just ate the middle rice and greens out and left tall piles of thick gummy like clumps behind on plate. Not good.   They didn't have a vegetarian option at all for their soup but charge the same as if you got meat in your bowl. How can you not have a vegetarian option for less cost?  Soup was good flavor as I doctored it up and the noodle were cooked perfectly. Got meat lovers I'm sure this place rocks."}
{"text":"Having moved to the South from he Boston area I've really struggled to find good Asian food. This place has saved me!! The Pho is amazing. Lots of variety in meat choices. Great flavor. Very authentic. They also have a special spicy oil that they serve with hot pot at dinner and when I come for lunch they always remember that I like it and bring it to me. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have a pho place in Steele creek! I was quite pleased with the pho broth, especially after reading the reviews. After eating the vermicelli noodles I noticed that I felt stronger and healthier than ever before. I had a broken tooth and I am pretty sure it regenerated. I can't imagine where else this super human strength could come from. Thank you pho Cali! I will be returning."}
{"text":"The pho is pretty good. I get extra limes. I've had more flavorful pho before but this place is better than some others I've had. The ambience is great and they have daily specials! If you're in the Steele Creek area you should stop by!   Crispy shrimp is GOOOOOODDDDD!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place. We often will go here at least once a week. You can really tell that everything is made to order (even the summer rolls, which many Vietnamese restaurants make ahead of time.)   The service is fast. The place is clean and well kept.   The pho broth is the best quality broth in the Charlotte region, hands down. It is not at all oily and it is extremely flavorful. It probably comes from the fact that they definitely use quality ingredients and make it fresh each day.  The summer rolls are so fresh that the rice paper is still sticky (not dry like at some places that make it ahead.)   Despite their dedication to freshness, they have no increase in their prices over any other Pho place I've been to.  We will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"No options for vegetarians. No vegetables at all even in the regular pho. It tasted good but so boring. Not what I expected."}
{"text":"Glad to finally have pho near by. Place is clean and nice. Staff is friendly. Food is phenomenal. Definitely suggest the fresh summer rolls. I thought the broth was great so disregard the other review. An awesome gem in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I love their pho soup. I never have to wait long for my food. I would recommend for those looking to try something different!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious... The service is super fast.... The staff was very friendly... Clean place.. I really enjoy coming here and i like the location.... Bubble gum tea is go go... First time trying it and i enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Really excellent meal. Was worried after reading some of the reviews, but they have definitely improved. Any delay in speed of food was explained by how fresh the items arrived at the table. Fresh summer rolls were made to order and served with a warm peanut sauce which was a nice twist. Both had Pho, one with Beef and they made mine to order with vegetables. Although you pay extra for vegetables, $2 up charge was worth it. Our server Melinda was super friendly and efficient. When we were done and needed to take our leftovers, she made sure to bring us a bag so we could put the container in it so it wouldn't leak in the car."}
{"text":"Nice staff but... This is not authentic pho, gave this place plenty of chances but every single time out of the 6 times I've been here the pho has tasted like water. Witch makes me wonder about the cooks ethics, don't know what's up with this place getting good reviews besides them maybe getting their friends and family to post. But they honestly should be ashamed for calling that pho. If you've been to Cali you know they would never serve anything like this."}
{"text":"Great people who own it,  fantastic food, very nice place. I go there a lot n take visitors there. I recommend the no. 23 or24"}
{"text":"Pho Cali is a small and quaint Vietnamese restaurant but don't be fooled. Great things come in small packages. They specialize in Vietnamese cuisine including rice dishes and multiple Pho options but they also offer amazing shellfish options by the pound like shrimp, crawfish, mussels, lobster and crab legs. Tonight I had the #17 Pho option which has rare beef, flank steak and brisket. It was \"Pho\" real! The ingredients were fresh in the onion tasted like they growing in the back. They always give you ample pieces of me and this time was no different. It was delicious as usual. I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? The food wasn't like it was 2-3 years ago. This last visit was such a disappointment. Everything that we have tried to order from the menu we were told that they no longer served it or they were out of it. So we got what they did have which were the wings that were like 2 inches long, I kid you not. The \"$23 per pound crab legs\" that were brought to our table were literally the size of my pinky. And I'm still trying to understand why they serve a $10 dish of chicken fried rice when all it looked like they did to it was tossed some chicken and cabbage together and stirred fried it with some rice. Oh well, now we know."}
{"text":"Very good boiled seafood, it reminds me of what I had in New Orleans. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Pho Cali is an amazing vietnamese cuisine in this little area. The food tastes amazing, the staff is very friendlly and fast. This place makes me happy! I hope others give it a try! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Terrific food. Truly welcoming service. Looks to be family owneed. We got excellent recommendations on which phone to order. My friend ordered pho (we made it XL so I could try some too) and they brought us an extra bowl without asking. I ordered a  vermicelli dish with shrimp and beef, it was delicious. I would love to go back to try out more from their menu."}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 times a month. The Pho and their seafood with the medium house seasoning ummm is always good. My husband does not try many things but he tried the chicken Pho and loved it. I myself get the beef flank tendon tripe trio. When they have avocados the smoothie is also delicious. The personalities are missing but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Nothing to write home about. The broth for the pho was mediocre... to be honest I had to keep adding siracha just to make it taste like something. They were out of a few items I asked for like the spring rolls and thai tea which was kind of a disappointment because I wanted to try a few different items since it was my first time there. It was around 5pm on a week night so I would've thought they would have a full menu to prepare for the dinner crowd which did show up while I was there. Overall I don't think I'll be going back. It wasn't horrible they just didn't give me a reason to want to return."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had in my entire life! The food is great! The service is great! It's a nicely kept secret but it needs its notoriety...."}
{"text":"I am glad to finally have a Pho restaurant on this side of town! My husband and I started with the Summer Rolls. I was glad that they were made with more noodles than lettuce. The only complaint about this dish was the peanut sauce wasn't to our liking. It was good just not our favorite in town. I had the #16 which is Pho with rare and well cooked beef, tripe, flank, and tendon. I was pleased with the soup. The tripe was a little chewy, but I've only found one place in charlotte where it wasn't so that was expected. Overall my meal was great. My husband had the # 11 (well and rare beef and meatballs) he finished the entire large bowl, which means he was pleased.   The place itself was very clean and somewhat quiet. There were just two other tables taken, so not too much chatter. Service was great. We tend to ask a lot of our servers because we seem to always need something. They were very nice and quick to get us everything we asked for.   We will visit again."}
{"text":"Came in a couple weeks before, I ordered number 28 and 42. 28 is a lemongrass chicken rice dish and it was fine but number 48 which is the special one that includes grill shrimp shredded pork and such as written on the menu. The \"surprise\" thing about it is all I got from that order was grilled pork and egg, nothing else while I had to pay for the price of number 48. Very disappointed on the first visit."}
{"text":"This review is for their crawfish/seafoods! Had them today for the first time (they just started serving seafood yesterday) and it was REALLY good! We got all the flavors to try but I liked the tangy cajun flavor the BEST. The waitress was very sweet and helpful with us today. Overall, service has always been good here. All their workers (especially the girls there) are always so pleasant and nice, I really loved that about them. Just thrilled to have decent crawfish nearby! Although the crawfish weren't big, it was a thumbs up in my eyes.  So yummy regardless!  Wished they had flavored milk tea and fruit infused tea though.  As for their Pho, I'm not too thrilled about it because it's not that good nor flavorful but it does satisfy cravings when I don't feel like driving across town.  Their shaken beef with tomatoes rice is really good though. I heard from friends the sticky rice with steamed chicken were good as well. I personally think their prices are a little overpriced (especially the seafoods) but I guess we'll have to deal with it because they just don't care, lol."}
{"text":"good place for workdays lunch. Large portion. Ordered combo pho and summer rolls, nice!"}
{"text":"Best takeout Ever!  Friday night, I'm in no mood to cook we decided to give this place a shot. The staff is super nice and helpful. The restaurant is kinda small. You could probably fit a good 70 people.   Interesting enough they have seafood on the menu....crawfish, shrimp, crab, lobster. You can basically get a bag of steamed crab, shrimp, and sausage with corn. Something like a Joes Crab Shack. Not your traditional Vietnamese restaurant, which puts this place at the top of my list. They also have pho and a few other Vietnamese dishes.   I decided to get the Bun(My Favorite) with shrimp And Pork.... They skimped on the shrimp big time! It was mostly pork with two pieces of shrimp....Wtf. Either way I loved the food. I also ordered fried spring rolls, and prawns.   Overall I plan to come back here, this place is awesome"}
{"text":"After much recommendations to try this place out. I suggested it to my husband when he was craving some crawfish similar to our favorite that closed last year.   He went out and tried it with family and they all liked it and rave how much similarities it had to our favorite crawfish joint.  Today, I finally tried this place out and it's a Vietnamese restaurant with the seafood option. Pretty good especially when you're craving a bowl of seafood while others around you wants to eat pho, etc.   [MY REVIEW IS SOLELY BASED ON THE SEAFOOD]  I got the #1 combo which consisted of black mussels, clams, crawfish and shrimp. It also came with two pieces of Italian sausage, two pieces of potatoes and three pieces of corn on the cob. The medium was spicy but I was still able to enjoy the meal without building up a sweat. :) My 6yr old and I were able to finish majority of it although if my husband were to eat some, we would've been able to finish it. Thus being, two adults sharing a bowl and it would be plenty. Now, the seafood is in a bag. They steam the seafood and then I'm assuming bag it, add the sauce, shake it up and serve.   What I liked about it:  They use a sauce to flavor up the seafood. Unlike the other joint down the street which used a dry seasoning.  Crawfish and the other seafood were indeed fresh. The crawfish were huge which is a plus. The portion of the extras included (corn, sausage, and potatoes) were decent.   What I didn't like: The corn tasted a bit off as if it was previously boiled or was sitting in a pot of water overnight. It had a slight off taste.   The restaurant is a bit small. So if you're bringing a large group, call ahead and reserve a table. Restrooms are pretty clean but nothing too special. No changing tables (for those mommies out there). Decor was those nets hanging around. It's okay considering they serve seafood and it was too tacky.   Overall, if you liked Flamin' then you'll love it here. Only downside is that they don't have the MyTeas which was a favorite to compliment the spicy mix of seafood."}
{"text":"The food was great. The pho has great taste to it. But the service sucks. We arrive a party of 3 and order our food before a big crowd of family came in. There was an additional of two couple and an additional family that came in after the huge family. We did not get our food until all the other parties that came in AFTER us ! The huge family got their food before us. The two couple got their food before us as well and so did the other family member next to us. Remind you they came in after us and order after us. Horrible service. We order smoothie to be deliver near the end of our meal. Well the smoothie came before our meal!!! WTF. SPOKE TO THE MANAGER AND HE JUST SAID \"SORRY ABOUT THAT\"   Really dude?"}
{"text":"Meh. Not worth it, if you are expecting a decent amount of food for the price. The seafood kind of smelled more fishy than I'm used to. Like it's been sitting out for a while. Service was slow, even if it wasn't busy; but I already expected that from reading previous reviews. I have server experience, so the \"service was slow\"  was an understatement.  I got to try out these items: Summer rolls: the best thing I had to eat that night Prawn rolls: 2nd best Chicken wings/ spicy: basic fried chicken with dry chili pepper powder on top- meh Shrimp and King crab/ house sauce/med spicy: a bit salty for my tastes, but at least it's edible. Or maybe it's edible because I'm pooling a lot of money for it.  Broken rice with grilled pork: not impressed. I've had better. Looked like a kid sized portion.   Overall it's not worth coming back to this place. They were not busy on a Saturday night (6-8), which means it probably isn't a restaurant worth fighting to eat at."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for their seafood. We got the combo one which is 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp, 1 lb of clams and 1 lb of mussels. They were accommodating and allowed us to substitute the crawfish for more shrimp. We got the house special sauce which to me was like a tamarind base. We got the medium spicy and that was pretty spicy to me but I can't do spicy like that. The food was steaming hot. You used to get a bucket to put your shells in but I guess they don't do that anymore so we discarded them on the white construction paper that they had laid down on the table. It's a nice little place to go and enjoy some seafood or pho. When we were cashing out we were told that the place had been sold. Sad to see the original owners go but I hope the new management keeps up or makes it better in their own way. Will definitely check them out to see how the new management goes."}
{"text":"Lunch at Pho Cali is steaming bowl of deliciousness. I love the vegetable pho. Great service,too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently split the #2 combo, in the house special seasoning super hot. Holy buttstuff it was spicy, and I loved it. The crawdads were a bit overcooked, but not much. The server was very friendly and the place was clean. We really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Nice staff and fast service but the pho is not good. It is the worst out of all the pho places I have tried in Charlotte. It's funny how it say pho cali but is nowhere near cali pho. I have been here several times and not once was the pho good just decent. A good thing I can say is the spring rolls are very big and a good bang for your buck but overall not worth it for me. I have even seen staff get supplies at food lion next door which might explain why the pho doesn't taste as authentic  but that's just my thought on it. My advice for anyone looking for some good pho or Vietnamese food in general to go to Doans, which isn't too far. It is very good, big portions and actually somewhat cheaper than pho cali."}
{"text":"After hearing that this place changed their menu and added seafood in the bag similar to Flaming Crawfish that closed down, I thought I'd give it another try. Ordered a pound of clams and shrimp in their house special seasoning with medium. Sigh.... They redeemed themselves. It was delish! Super garlic flavor, which I like but I definitely burped that garlic up all night. LOL. So not a first date meal.  I'd be back for this."}
{"text":"Pho Cali 9107 S Tryon St Charlotte, NC 28273 Wednesday September 13, 2017 1pm   Where do I start... let's just say the sign out front is true, they are hiring. It's basically a one man show once you come inside.   When we entered it was the lunch rush and all of the empty tables were dirty with dishes. The server/hostess/busboy tried to seat us at a table he had cleared but was connected to another table that was dirty. I told him no rush and that we would wait for him to empty/clean the other table.   I ordered the #10 Pho Tai Bo Vien (rare beef and meatball) and my mom ordered the #7 Pho Tai, Nam (rare and flank steak). My mother also has to try the chicken wings at every Asian restaurant so she ordered the appetizer chicken wings. The server told us the only difference between the spicy and the Cajun wings were the Cajun wings are saltier and the spicy wings have cayenne pepper sprinkled on them. We opted for the spicy wings. When they arrived it wasn't what we were expecting. We got 5 crispy fried wings and a side of ketchup. They were just a bit spicy when you got a taste of the cayenne pepper.   Next was our pho. We both chose the XL bowl because we wanted to share with my niece and nephew. The server brought out the veggies that you add to your Pho, normally lemons, jalapeños, bean sprouts and basil. Our plate was missing the basil. I looked around and some of the dirty tables still had basil sprigs lingering around so I thought it was just a mistake and our server forgot. When I asked for the basil I was informed that they had run out! Yikes!!! To tell the truth and not to seem like a pho snob but I was very disappointed when I found out there was no basil! It makes the pho so much tastier!!!  The flank steak in my mom's soup was very good! I would much rather have that than the rare beef.  Even after sharing our bowls we both still had a large amount to take home with us.   As we were paying I overheard another customer asked for the Korean BBQ and he was told they were out. Not sure what the deal is with them running out of things isn't cool.   All in all this was my second visit here and I'm not so sure if I'm coming back anytime soon. If I do it will be to have the FLANK STEAK in my pho!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Went for lunch. Bowl of pho and summer rolls. Pho broth was excellent. Clear and had great flavor, maybe a little light on the condiments. Very clean establishment. Good service. Came quickly. My only issue would be that it was too clean. Pho joints should have an edge to them."}
{"text":"I ordered the pho and it was decent. Not the best but not the worst. My aunt got the stir fried noodles which looked good. The crawfish were decent size but the flavor was lacking."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I've tried nearly everything.  Pho is ok. Their loc lak beef cube dish is very delicious although a bit pricey for the portion size. I've tried their stir-fried egg noodles. It's good... but they have trouble seasoning it evenly. I'll get a bite of very bland noodles then one that's very flavorful. Their Hainan chicken is not real traditional Hainan chicken. It's ok. Vermicelli is good. I also like their lemongrass chicken. It's got good flavor but it's dark meat for those of you who only eat white meat may not want to order it.  Overall if you go there for the traditional Vietnamese food I would rate it as good."}
{"text":"First of all, I couldn't believe they had Durian. I ordered a smoothie and it was really good. The smell is bad, but not as bad as people make it to be. The flavor is definitely overhyped, but it tastes good. If you don't know what I'm talking about Google the fruit Durian, is a weird looking fruit infamous because of its odor, but I'd you get past it you are rewarded with a very delicious flavor.  As far as food goes, everything is made fresh so you can make every dish in the menu a vegetarian one, spring rolls are amazing. I didn't love the peanut sauce, I thought the flavor was very overwhelming for the fresh roll, and once you dip your roll in it all you can taste is peanut.   I ordered the seafood pho which consists of crab, shrimp and squid. As a recommendation I would skip the crab because the pho will over cook it and the meat will get a weird texture. If you do order the crab make sure that's the first thing you eat.   The staff is very friendly, and it seems like they get a lot of regulars because they automatically noticed I was a new customer, we chit chatted for a few minutes after I paid, and they were all very friendly. Excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Charming little place. I love the pho and the seafood selection is awesome. Summer rolls with warm peanut sauce is a must. Great date restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good. I went with a Vietnamese co worker and he was very pleased.  Nice, attentive staff. The summer rolls were very good. A switch from the fried ones we are accustomed to."}
{"text":"We came here for boiled crawfish.  If you are from Louisiana and you are also looking for boiled crawfish... GO TO LOUISIANA!  Use the money you would have spent on crawfish here to buy gas.  Get some Pho... I'm sure it's pretty good.    We paid $40 each and left here hungry.  Crawfish were mixed in size but were mostly tiny.  Shells were rubbery as if they had been cooked twice which made peeling them a real pain.  The tiny ones were easily destroyed in the process of peeling them.  Anyway they were severely over cooked.  We also had the shrimp... they were also over cooked and probably were from frozen based on my experience, but they were descent size and the best thing we had here.  Corn was also over cooked or old.  Potatoes were large but didn't absorb any flavor during cooking.  Sausage was Italian sausage not cajun sausage as we were expecting.   Service was very good and the place was clean... I would not hesitate to return for some Pho but I wouldn't drive 2 hours for that."}
{"text":"I was traveling and took a blind shot at this place based solely on Yelp reviews. The restaurant was empty when I arrived, but I still gave it a go. As I reviewed the menu, several patrons filtered inside. The atmosphere is more like a sandwich shop, but the Pho and Summer Rolls were very good. The price was also very reasonable, particularly given the high quality, fresh ingredients. Next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to return here."}
{"text":"Pho is good. Definitely missing toppings but taste-wise is was good. They have some extra fixings on the table for you to add on to your pho. They don't have wonton soup only pho. They also have seafood but I didn't try it. Service was decent and prices were average. The Thai tea was good. A little farther from where I was staying at but not too bad. Small parking area with different shops sharing it and only one way in/out. It gets very congested during lunch rush hours. Not a quick stop to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I was enjoying my Pho until half way in I saw a small worm.  It looks like a maggot worm - so gross!  They have a sanitation rating of 97.5.  I want to throw up."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I always get a noodle bowl when i'm here. dont skip it!! So fresh and so delicious!"}
{"text":"We wouldn't know. Attempted to go last night, but they were closed. Hours say open till 2am on Friday and Saturday. We went at 12:30am. Hours say open till 9pm today. Nope. Closed again. Suggestion: fix your hours! Nothing drives people away from a restaurant more than making the trip only to find out the place is closed contrary to the hours on the website."}
{"text":"The snow crab in Cajun spicy with corn was incredible! Then I left room for pho. The waiter suggested the one with beef, tripe, and shrimp.  I might try the vermicelli on the next trip. Super good!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Pho Cali--specifically for their Pho (I haven't tried any other dishes yet). It's been hard to find good pho in the Charlotte area, and was impressed by the freshness and flavor of the pho Cali. I felt that it was very authentic as well.   My only complaint was that waiting for take-out took time, but that was only because they were packed FULL for lunch. To me, that's a great sign. They were very polite and I could tell they were working very hard.   Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Love me some Pho Cali!  I always order the #20, Vermicelli Bowl.  Delicious and plenty filling.  What I truly love about the Vietnamese food is that you are full, but don't feel like a brick is setting in your stomach.  The sauces are great, the staff is great and I think the service is quick.  I just wish the prices were a little lower...at least at lunch..  Hard to justify $11+ for lunch every day.  It they had lower prices, I would probably go 2-3 times a week.  That's my only complaint...and I still go once a week!"}
{"text":"I love Pho, and being from Vegas, I'm pretty spoiled with the amount of places we have. But now that I'm in Charlotte, I've gotten used to the okay-decent pho restaurants in the area.   However... The pho was delicious here - The meat was thin and great! My only complaint about my soup was that the meat must have been so thin, it disappeared!!! I only had about 4 pieces of meat in my soup. But what I had was good.  We also ordered a pound of shrimp, house sauce, medium spice. It was good! They had a different flavoring than what I'm used to, but it was really delicious! Good sized shrimp, easy to peel, and good taste.  Now, the service. If you're coming here for good service and wanting to be waited on well, don't come. But if you want seafood or pho then go.  First strike was when our server was picking something out of the water cup with the straw with no gloves and hands on the actual straw. And then brought us the cup that he picked stuff out of.... Gross.  Once we ordered, I asked him to bring the shrimp first, THEN the soup. He said sure, and then brought the soup and shrimp at the same time, and didn't bring us anything we needed for the soup or the shrimp.  Either way, I may come back. Just I'll be prepared for the mediocre service that comes with it!"}
{"text":"Slow. Slow. Slooooow service.  The food was alright, but nothing comes with veggies! I had to add them to my order and even then there were not many. Plus, you really don't get much bang for your buck here - or at least not on the workweek lunchtime."}
{"text":"Saturday 9/26 was the first time trying out this restaurant. It's pretty good.  I ordered a small Pho Dac Biet and my bf got the large. The bowl sizes werent a big difference but the prices were. The broth was good and sweet. We were full and pleased with the food.   We have been searching for a good spot for pho and Charlotte does not have any... But this place may be a contender. We just hope the second visit will be the same and their consistency of good food is there. The other pho restaurants don't have any consistency. Most Pho restaurants in Charlotte are rip offs.   We like this place and the workers seem nice here. It was pretty slow for them in the morning but when its a good restaurant then i'd support them any way I can.   Con: the avocado smoothie and thai tea isnt great. Too much ice in my smoothie and the thai tea is too milky and sweet.  So the food is good but the drinks are ok..  See you soon Pho Cali!"}
