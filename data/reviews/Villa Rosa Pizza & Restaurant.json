{"text":"sucha a nice cute Italian place, only ordered a pizza for take out but the lady working was  wonderful.. I'll definitely be back and encourage others to give it a try you won't be dissapointed :)"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY rude owner/worker. She stood in the empty parking parking lot while I looked for a place to figure out directions and cursed and yelled until I drove away. Horribly horribly rude and uncalled for. I found another place to park on the street and she followed me out and continued to yell at me to move because I was now apparently parked by her car which is \"f***ing unacceptable\". I was on a public street and was not blocking in any cars! What?? I will never step foot in that parking lot or her restaurant because of this. Despicable."}
{"text":"I love their pizza.  I just haven't been able to figure out online if this place is open anymore."}
{"text":"We met an old friend here for lunch, the place was a ghost-town. Ordered two pizzas and an eggplant parmesean sandwich.
The food came fast enough, service was quiet but friendly. The food was pretty lame... pizzas were cooked correctly and the crust/sauce were good, but the toppings were awful. Mushrooms right from the can, cheap & greasy pepperoni... you know. The sandwich was really doughy, mainly bread - hardly any sauce or flavor.
Atmosphere was standard cheap pizza place, jukebox out of order, plastic table-tops.

Definately could've found a better place to eat."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here many times.  With the exception of the mushrooms, which are canned, I've found their ingredients to be fresh and delicious. The sausage and pepperoni are terrific. The crust is tasty.  I've only eaten in the restaurant once, and for me, this is really a takeout place, but it's one of my favorites."}
