{"text":"I was I introduced to Lakeview Burger by my brother about a year ago.  He took me to their Oshawa location on Cedar Street, I was very impressed by their food quality and reasonable prices.  Unfortunately, because I live in Whitby and don't get out that way very often, I wasn't a regular customer.  I was very happy when they opened a location in Whitby over the summer, and I now have a new favourite burger joint.  I have been quite a few times, and have not had a bad experience so far. They make fresh, quality food, and their prices are great. They frequently run specials, so you should follow them on Facebook to get notifications. I saw an ad for a special, so by ordering online, I got a burger (no cheese or bacon) and fries for $5. I chose to add a drink and upgrade to onion rings for $1.10. My total after taxes was $8.80. That's cheaper than McDonald's, and you can't even compare the two, quality-wise.  I drove there right after I ordered (less than 10 minutes), walked in, and my order was ready and waiting for me. The onion rings were excellent, second-best only to Buster Rhino's, IMO. They were hot, crispy, and had just the right amount of breading, without any doughiness.  Not only that, but they were breaded properly, and I didn't have ANY \"onion pulls\" where you're left with a limp onion strand hanging from your mouth, while you're left holding an empty batter-shell.  Not only were they hot, crispy, and delicious, but I was so amazed by how NOT greasy they were, that I took a picture of the box, after eating most of the onion rings, and there's no grease stains.  I've never seen that happen before!  The burgers are hot and delicious, and the toppings are always fresh and crisp. They're not huge (5oz, I believe), but they are an awesome value, especially when you take advantage of the frequent specials! The fries are always super-tasty, so I always have to debate whether to order the onion rings or fries, but there's not really a wrong choice. It just depends on what you're in the mood for.  If you haven't tried them out yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Overall I'd say this is a pretty good place to eat.  It's simple, nothing fancy.  The food is prepared when ordered and it's reasonably priced.  The fries are GREAT.. highly suggest having the fries.  The poutine is pretty good not the best.  The cheese is good, the gravy is some sort of canned stuff you taste at other places, it's similar to the gravy at Swiss Chalet.  The burger is decent but it's pretty much a Harvey's Hamburger but a bit more \"home made\".   It has that same liquid smoke flavouring.   The service seems fine, they could clean the place a bit more and have keep on top of the napkins and other extras.   The soda fountain is AMAZING.  First place I've seen have that special fountain with dozens of flavours.    I'll be going back but I might try something other than the burger."}
{"text":"I found the overall Lakeview Burger experience disappointing.  Going in, this new location already looks run down.  Bathrooms are a mess, dining room not well kept, customer service is poor, poorly managed.  To be fair, the burger itself was actually very good, although they have very limited, basic toppings.  They also have a cool Coke dispensing machine that can produce any flavor of Coke or Coke owned products.  However the fries were cooked in dirty oil, over cooked, tough and dry.  Tasted like they had been sitting for a while then put back in the deep fryer.  It's unfortunate as the burger itself was very good, but because of the overall experience, it's unlikely I will go back."}
{"text":"Lakeview Burger is located at the corner of Thickson and Delaney in the No Frills plaza.  We came in on a Sunday at lunch time to check this place out. Reviews are all over the place, so we knew we'd have to give it a shot to see for ourselves. We came in about 12:30 and the place was dead. The girl behind the counter was not impressed or something, not particularly friendly, but not rude or anything.   We both opted for the Mac and Cheese Burger with fries. A note, they only do canned pop at this location. A lot of reviews elsewhere mention a fancy coke machine, but they don't have it at this location. However, I was surprised to see a selection of ice creams at the front counter (I'm assuming for milkshakes)! Our order didn't take long to make and we were out the door with takeout.  Really good burger, but the mac and cheese got lost in it. The burger itself is meaty and slightly greasy (not a bad thing, the bun holds up well). Add bacon and cheese and your toppings and it's a great burger. I never finish burgers like this and I devoured the whole thing. Fries are close to chip truck fries, pretty tasty and nicely salted.   Two combos with fries ran us $28, pricey-ish for lunch but there's a good portion and the add ons definitely upped the price (bacon, mac and cheese bites).   The menu is expansive, they have wraps, chicken burgers, chicken strips, poutine, hot dogs, grilled cheese... I'm really looking forward to trying out some other items next time we come. Definitely worth a stop, this place has tasty potential to get into our regular rotation. The location is the primary draw for us, food stays hotter when you don't have as far to go."}
{"text":"I Wish I saw the first review. I could have saved myself the agony. My girlfriend and I tried this place because it's new and nearby. Complete fail.  I would expect the employees to have sampled the menu as part of the training process in order to give customers suggestions or must tries. Apparently that doesn't happen here. The cashier hadn't tried any of the menu items we asked about. We went with basic items to be safe and to be completely honest it wasn't edible. The fries were not cooked all the way. The lettuce was yellow. Burger basic. Bacon very fatty and limp.  To top it all off we dined to the stereo blasting from the kitchen. Very disappointed"}
