{"text":"Great perch dinners Wed and Fridays"}
{"text":"You are lucky to stumble across this little joint if you are in the town of Cuyahoga Falls, OH. This place has got AMAZING wings and a great burger! (especially the Chipotle BBQ Burger) All the food and drinks were very reasonably priced. The only complaint that I have was they were a bit under staffed, it took a little while to receive our food but the wait was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Good drinks at a fair price.  The food is always smells great and the prices are very fair.

BUT...The last time I was there, there was no soap and no paper towels in the men's room.  Now MAYBE the cooks wash their hands in the kitchen, but I don't feel comfortable eating somewhere if the staff doesn't keep the restrooms in a condition where you can wash your hands and/or doesn't care enough to keep the restroom in a condition that makes it clear that good sanitary practices are a high priority..."}
{"text":"The only reason I put up with this place and their stupid rules was 25 cent wing night, which has now been changed to 50 cents. Don't worry though, they still make you buy a drink even though 50 cents is hardly a special and they still don't allow refills on pop. 
One night I went and asked if they could put the Cavs on and the lady told me she would. Not only did she not put the game on but she avoided any contact with me for the rest of my visit. Another time I went with 4 of my friends and they told us they couldn't seat us until the entire party was there even though we told them the last person was on his way and would be there in five minutes. They decided to give our table to someone else and sure enough our friend arrived right after. We had to wait another 45 minutes before a table opened up."}
{"text":"My husband and I are lucky to have this place within walking distance of where we live. When we first moved to the Falls we were told that we should check out their wing night on Tuesday, .25/wings (with an order of a beverage). The wings are delicious and huge! Definitely worth the wait for a table and for the wings to come out. The service has always been great, the staff is always friendly. I've also been there for their fish special, very tasty! But again, busy, but worth it! We have also gone up there on Saturday nights, less of a crowd and very easy to find a spot to sit at right away. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for an enjoyable bar and tasty food."}
{"text":"This time around this place was DISGUSTING!!! Our server (if you want to call her that) Rachelle was absolutely HORRIBLE!!!! My wife and I have never had worse service. The food was cold and had pretty much no taste, not to mention the bugs I saw crawling around, ew!!!! These people also have no clue apparently that it has been hot out lately because there was no air on, I almost didn't want to eat because I was so hot in there, which probably would have been my best bet since the food sucked. 
I also can not get over how bad our server was....HORRIBLE!!! I will never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Mix of Mediterranean and \"American\" food, prepared well, with a full bar and great atmosphere.  So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots! Super cheap, oversized wings & superb service, always. They offer specials nearly every night of the week. I'm also a fan of their fried fish & even the chicken nuggets from the kids' menu!"}
{"text":"The Boulevard Tavern, built back in the early 1930's, looks like one of those local neighborhood joints that no one outside the area knows about. I stopped in with eight friends last Saturday and experienced one awesome burger. Six of us tried the burgers, with one enjoying theirs so much they ordered one to go to enjoy the next day.

Most of us chose the Chipotle Burger, with six ounces of ground chuck, cheddar cheese, smoked bacon and garlic sauteed mushrooms, topped with a smokey BBQ, sauce for $7.99. It's served with fries, which were also really quite good. If you don't like Hot, get the sauce on the side. A few people did just that, and so some of the more adventurous of us dipped some fries directly into the sauce. By itself, the BBQ sauce is hot, but the spoonful they slather on the burger is just enough to compliment the beef. And the beef was so good.

The person who tried the Bouley Burger (regular cheeseburger topped with a fried egg, $6.99) said it was also good but I noticed the egg was slightly overcooked and the yoke was not runny. THE ONLY REASON TO EVER ORDER A FRIED EGG IS TO ENJOY THE RUNNY YOKE.

Everyone raved about their burgers, especially the beef, cooked perfectly. A vegetarian tried the falafal, couldn't finish it, but made sure they took what was left home, giving it a thumbs up.

The only disappointment that evening was the serious lack of customers in the place. When we left at around 8:00 there was only one table occupied, with three people, and one booth. Really folks, this place should be packed. There is a parking lot in the back, a few spots on the street, and the owner lives next door (east) so feel free to park on the grass there. I'm planning on a return trip as soon as possible."}
{"text":"There's a girl there I think her name is Rachelle she was extremely rude when I asked for some drinks. She was constantly on her phone and seemed to ignore a lot of the other people there as well. The food was great but the service was horrible!"}
{"text":"This review is specific and limited to their Tuesday wing night special. Being a fan of Buffalo styled wings, I couldn't resist the 25 cent wing specials they run here on Tuesday nights. Caveat: You can only order 12 wings per person, max 2 flavors, as you need at least 6 wings for each flavor. Also, be prepared to wait, as the wings often take about 30 minutes to hit your table. Celery/ranch are extra. Beer selection is limited. Seating is even more limited. In order to invoke the wing night special, you have to order a drink (bottled water and iced tea are fine). There are about 8 or so flavors, so bring friends to try out the rest.

All that aside, these wings are pretty decent considering they're just a quarter a piece. When they advertise jumbo sized wings, there's definitely an ounce of truth to it (pun inadvertently intended). The wings come out hot, crisp, generously sized, and bathed in the appropriate sauce. The extra hot carries a kick, but definitely doable. The \"ranchy spicy\" is solid, and the regular hot is probably the most representative of what a Buffalo wing should be. Some of my compatriots enjoyed the honey mustard and BBQ as well.

Best wings ever? Probably not, but for the value around here, can't be beat."}
{"text":"A wonderful neighborhood place with great service and cool art deco bar. Had the lake perch dinner. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago while visiting my sister after asking her where to get a great fish dinner on a Friday night.  It was pretty delicious.  The fish was perch and the breading was homemade...it was light and not all greasy, which was a nice change from your traditional fried fish dinner.  I would love to go back and try some of the other options.  I was impressed to see that even though it is a bar, they had a lot of Mediterranean dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"When I was a kid, i walked past this place on my way to school. Now its one of my favs.
The perch dinner is the best in the Akron area. This is not an expensive place, its just good.
Beer is cold and the food is delicious.

If you want a table on a Friday come early, because this place is packed."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly and a great fish dinner.  The perch dinner is the best in the area."}
{"text":"This place is very clean , the employees all were very friendly! We ordered the special filet baked potato and salad! The dinner was delicious! We had the wings for an appetizer they are fresh not frozen! Very good! We will definitely be back here to eat !"}
{"text":"Pretty cool little local Tavern.  Not a lot of taps but at least what was on tap was good beer.   They were swamped for a Thursday night with a couple big groups.  Even so,  the service was pretty good and our server was very friendly.   I had the chicken wrap which was very good and my date had the filet mignon special which was large,  tender,  and perfectly cooked.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best fish on the planet. Great service. Always a great place to eat."}
{"text":"We really like it here. I'm vegetarian and appreciate having options.
Good wine and beer, service has always been good, I'm glad we tried it."}
{"text":"Terrific old restaurant, bar, tavern, with a Lebanese flair.  Established in 1930's, same family owner and location all those years. Off the beaten path hidden in quiet neighborhood in Cuyahoga Falls. Had the beef shish-kabob including salad, hummus and pita, which was delightful. Open for dinner M-Sat. Lunch Fri only. Lots of regulars. A must try for all."}
{"text":"Standing at the bar I waited to give the barkeep my drink order. She stood there looking at me for awhile so I decided I would walk down to where she was \"I'd like a Lager please.\" She looked at me for a moment and replied \"well I'm waiting for your party to seat then I'll take your order.\" I look around at the empty bar, she was obviously very busy, I looked at my family who showed no signs of sitting down soon, I just wanted a beer... Guess I shouldn't ask so much... Of a bar...  

It was time to order our food, \"I'll have the steak sandwich please.\" She looked around again \"we are all out.\" I look over the menu which included about as many items as I could count on one hand. Thats great ... Your doing a good job... 

I know you are next to the rubber city, but you didn't need to make your chicken as such.

I'd also like to add that after posting this review I not only got a harassing message from someone who was either an owner or employee, but my Uncle who had nothing to do with the posting of this review was harassed upon his next visit to this restaurant. They told him to \"take the review down.\" He actually liked your little outfit, so I'm not sure what you were trying to accomplish.

Class act."}
{"text":"This is a review of the Boulevard's wings, not the whole restaurant, which has very decent food.  So their wings are awesome. They told me they buy them fresh and never freeze them.  They cook them to order, not in huge batches, so every order is cooked for you.  They're cooked perfectly - crispy never overdone.  Tuesday night is their wing night  ($.25/wing)and you can order by the number, and it's easily the best wing deal anywhere.  

There is no comparison between BW3's wings and Boulevard wings. BW3 definitely has a wider range of sauces, but their wings are a joke.

So, while Boulevard doen't have a lot of sauces, they don't really need them.  These wings are nearly the size of normal chicken legs.  The medium sauce is great, and sometimes, when the right cook is working, and if they're not too busy, you can get them to mix the bbq and the medium. Everyone I've taken to this place for wings thinks they're the best they've ever had.  

Don't be cheap.  The help here is great. Tip well."}
{"text":"My husband chose this place because he was seeking some Mediterranean  food.  We had Kebab, Swaurama (misspelled, sorry) and a burger.  The server was so sweet to us.  Great service experience. Friendly to our children.  So-so choice of beers, we were happy to at least have a couple of craft beers to choose from.  We enjoyed our food. Definitely would come back.  Their side salads with house dressing is delicious. I'd go back just for that.  Nice little hidden gem that you should definitely check out!"}
{"text":"We went here for the fish fry, not our normal meal out but we had the desire to do a local fish fry...and unfortunately choose the Boulevard. 

I can't review the food because we never got a table. We were told there was a 30 minute wait by the hostess. As we were waiting we noticed multiple empty tables, at one point five tables that could seat people. I timed the five empty tables and they sat empty for over 8 minutes and NO ONE was sat during that time. 

We waited for an hour and the whole time we were there at least one table sat empty and usually two with no one being sat. We could not figure out why the hostess were not seating people.

Apparently the wait staff was struggling to figure this out because one waitress came up multiple times, with silverware in her had, asking why there were empty tables. She asked \"who is next, push their number\" (push the number for the electronic beacon they give you). The two hostess just kept looking at their waiting list and did not call anyone. Okay it is not just me but the staff is now frustrated. 

Well the hostess sat two women that were waiting next to us...they came in after us. When we asked why we were skipped the hostess said \"we had to sit them before you\". 

My wife figured it out looking at the waiting list. The hostess were seating people out of order and playing favorites. I don't know if this is restaurant policy or just the hostess playing games. Either way I advice avoiding this place. 

PS: You will notice I do not give many bad reviews that should tell you what I think of this place."}
{"text":"Local business who is doing it right! Our first visit was tonight. Drawn in by the wing special... Can't beat .25 wings! When they say they are jumbo they really mean it.  Their wings are large and in charge.  Put wing warehouse, bw3, and on tap to shame. They bread their wings which is interesting and something we've never had anywhere else but was really tasty. Not a ton of flavor options but what they have is good. I liked the ranchi flavor and my boyfriend said the mild were good. If you get a sauce lube bbq or honey mustard be careful because the sauce kinda soaks into the wings making them not as crispy. Did not have that problem with the mild or ranchi. Our server was amazing.  So sweet and nice and accommodating and had knowledge about the menu. Wings took a bit but they forewarned you when you sit down because all the wings are fresh and cooked per order. Might want to note that you must purchase a beverage in order to get the wing special (pop was 2.50). Nice atmosphere and a very small town local bar feel..probably that's because that's what it is! Filled up pretty quick. We got there about 4:15 and by 5 it was pretty busy.  When we left after 6 there was a wait to get a table.  Parking out back was convenient and not a problem but at busier times or later i can see it being hard to gind a space. Might have just been tonight but it was definitely an older crowd with most of the patrons being 65+. But not a problem to me because then there's no worry about rowdy idiots. There was a table of nuns there too! The manager Mary Ann was sweet and very nice when we complimented our waitress who actually is her daughter.  Great place and we will for sure be back. I like giving my money to local businesses and this one really measures up."}
{"text":"was at the boulevard two weeks ago.  we were seated and had ordered one drink.  when we wanted to move to sit with friends we were told we could not because our waitress would change.  who now takes precedence, the customer or the waitress.  we could have easily tipped the initial waitress and paid for the drink.  we're not likely to return since accommadations that could have been met so easily, were not.  L. C."}
{"text":"Impressive. I gave this 5 stars for what it is- a nice, clean, very quaint bar/restaurant     .  I had the Moroccan cigars appetizer for my meal. Quite tasty. My bf had the perch special (on Friday) and it was delish. The prices here are awesome. The service was great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow! What a mess. We went based on reviews, but the whole experience was terrible. Taylor S. was our server. She was the worst I think we have ever had (and we eat out a ton- nice job on that accomplishment).  Taylor was the perfect combo of no personality and no care to try. 

We went on wing night, which took over and hour and a half to cook, but somehow came out lukewarm. She assured us they had just finished. It was fitting she dropped the check with no comment, and did not return. When we left, she was out back smoking. Why did I leave any tip?

Wings are breaded, which I did not realize. The sauce was not good, wings were undercooked (although advertised as \"crispy\") and not hot as mentioned above. 

Why would a restaurant sell wings at a loss, causing 2 hour table turn times, and angry servers since all the elderly eating tip 10% on a $9 tab? Might want to rethink your business strategy."}
{"text":"Well, they let me stand at the Chestnut Street entrance in front of the \"Please Wait to Be Seated\" sign.  I finally flagged down a waitstaff (they saw me they just ignored me) and she said \"oh dont you know you come in back there?\"  I said it would've been nice if someone had told me instead of letting me stand a fool, she ignored me. So did the hostess not wanting to say sorry.  Evening saved by my amazing waiter Laura and my Lake Perch! Millennials get your sh** together, I dont have to spend my money where you work."}
{"text":"Went for wing night, .50 a piece. Not bad. However, you can only get 6 or 12, and no more then 12. You have to buy a beverage. Celery and ranch are both extra. The wings had barely any sauce on them, so I asked for extra and was charged. The sauce was not very hot, more butter then anything. If you have any left over wings, you cannot take them with you. Service was average at best. So it's hardly a deal. My suggestion, go to a place with good wings. Works out to be the same price anyways."}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped in on a Wednesday for dinner around 6:30. Casual environment with super friendly staff, smaller menu, appeared to be popular with locals, judging by what appeared to be a few tables with regulars chatting it up with staff. 

I had the falafel wrap - a little different with the addition of pickles, but good. Husband had the Boulevard burger and enjoyed it. Both were served with fries that were just OK. 

Two less than ideal points were that it was quite warm (AC wasn't running) and with the back door open, the smoke from smokers was flooding into the dining space. 

When in the area again, we'll consider returning."}
{"text":"Delicious ale Erie perch
The service was wonderful too
We had a large group for Christmas luncheon at work - and wow they really accommodated us and the servers were absolutely wonderful - the place is a typical neighborhood bar/tavern atmosphere and accommodated a group of 35-40 

And did I say the Lake Erie perch was wonderful?"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  We stopped eating here and thought we'd try again. Well it's the last time.  What ever you do, Never order your food to go. They automatically add a $2.00 \"to go\" fee to each dinner. Oh and they neglect to inform you they're going to do it. Lastly the portion sizes you get are quite small for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"Tuesday night is wing night and they are huge and super crispy. Lots of beer on tap and friendly staff. All the waitresses must have stopped at my table asked if I needed something. Wonderful place lots of tv's and family feel."}
{"text":"In terms of bar food, The Boulevard should win a few prizes. Their burgers are fantastic, and their jumbo wings are excellent and freshly prepared. My biggest criticism of their wings is the lack of available flavors (and the \"extra-hot\" does not live up to its name). On Tuesdays they have a dine-in wing special that draws an impressive local crowd. They also have a popular fish special on Fridays. This is a quality family-owned/operated local bar. The service is usually pretty good, but can be slow (but worth it) when busy. The menu has a mediterranean flare, which is unexpected for a \"tavern.\"  I enjoy the comfortable atmosphere and it's cleanliness. Pro-tip: ask for pierogies; they are not on the menu, but come fresh from a stand in The West Side Market in Cleveland."}
{"text":"1 star for calling Boulevard Tavern for take out food for the first time and being put on hold. Once bartender came back, I asked some questions about wing flavors was told to know what I wanted beforehand. Kind of hard to do since it was my first time calling. Great girst impression."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the lake perch special, which was delicious. The wings we had for appetizer were probsbly the best wings I've ever had. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cool and laid back. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was asked to leave The Boulevard Tavern because I brought my own hot tea (organic, chemical-free, alkaline water, caffeine free), which they could not serve me.  I agreed to buy a hot tea from them, however they said I could not drink my tea even if I bought one from them. I explained that I'm undergoing IVF treatment and have strict dietary restrictions, however this medical information was disregarded.

The very rude waitress told me it was \"against the law\". REALLY... against the law to drink healthy hot tea?!?!?!?

I requested the law code that described this incredibly awful violation.  It was not provided, instead I was asked to leave for being disruptive. 

My boyfriend and I left (paid for his beer which he did not take a sip of) and proceeded to a different restaurant (3 miles away) and I drank my tea with my meal...NO QUESTIONS ASKED!

So I would just like to say that The Boulevard Tavern in Cuyahoga Falls is a drink bully. Everyone should have the opportunity to chose health over the norm."}
{"text":"We just tried to buy a gift certificate for an elderly friend who has been coming here for years.  When we showed up, the manager (Sean) called through the door that they were close (it was before 2pm).  Then when we said we just wanted to buy a g.c., he rudely said that they don't have any.  I called after 2pm to see why we had such poor customer service, and he asked me, 'what else should I have done?'  I explained that proper customer service would have looked differently, and proceeded to tell him how it should have gone down.  Really poor communication.  I asked that the owner call me back, we'll see.
I can't eat at a place where they aren't polite to the customers, no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"Nice local bar. Nothing fancy, but friendly service with your standard selection of liquor. Some craft beers on draft. Prices are all reasonable ($5-$6 for standard mixed drinks)."}
{"text":"This is a local place that has a great vibe, staff and food.  The interior is mostly wood and traditional, kinda like Cheers.  The staff is incredibly friendly and I have NEVER had a bad experience there.  I ALWAYS get their falafel which is TO DIE FOR!  Instead of fries, I get the fattoush salad.  It is so good, I am drooling as I type this. I have had their wings and they are good, but I am so in love with the fattoush that I can't bring myself to have anything else!  My youngest is six and asks for it weekly.

Delicious!  Tell them I sent you- they know me!

Update- my youngest is now 12 & we still get fattoush & falafel! 6 years strong!"}
{"text":"Wings are great. But why you have to wait till
 All your  party arrives to be seated at a bar is beyond me. Come on people this is a bar"}
{"text":"Perch dinner is almost as good as a fish dinner on a Friday night in northern Wisconsin.  Lightly breaded and fried served up in 3 or 5 piece servings with big helping of fries and choice of slaw, salad, or apple sauce.   Cheeseburger with a fried egg is delicious.  Only reason I'm not giving them a five star is the service.  Wait staff is a little laid back and a bit slow.  Since trying this place s few weeks ago, we've been three more times we loved the food so much.  Oh, failed to mention the prices re great too"}
{"text":"A coworker and I make this place a regular stop on Friday lunch.  We usually get the fish, which is always great.  Jess, Rochelle and Mary Ann are always friendly and attentive... and they keep us coming back.  There are always regulars in the place, and it's always pretty busy... but we rarely have to wait at all for service or our food.  We will continue to make this part of our Friday rotation."}
{"text":"Thursday night is steak night and for $11 the filet is terrific.  Other nights it's a pretty cool mix of bar food with a few Mediterranean touches like a really good pita/hummus appetizer.  My wife sticks with the burger and fries. 

We've had great service on popular nights, like Thursday.   On Monday, not so much. 

Physically, this place has an interesting quirky look,  with booths up high and tables lower.  The bar appears to date back to the Depression.   You can enter from the front, where you can seat yourself, or from the back, in which case they will probably greet you and can help you choose a spot if you want.  
 
Prices are very reasonable.  And the chef is serious about his food, which is nice to see."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Cuyahoga Falls! A nice, warm atmosphere mixed with great customer service, spirits and a variety of foods, from pub food (I recommend the burgers) to fish (the fish special is awesome) and Mediterranean (the hummus is fantastic). Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Oh my god the wings... Cheap wing night can take a while, but it's so worth it. They bread everything fresh, not frozen, and it is GOOD. Everything here is so great. The perch dinners are exceptional too! It's a little hard to find, and the service is a little slow sometimes, but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much from both Yelp and friends about the wonderful perch here, I finally went to try it for lunch today. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad food or anything, but it just didn't live up to the hype. Neither the perch nor the french fries had much flavor. I kept adding salt to both, but still, total lack of flavor. The coleslaw was ok. The atmosphere was nice, as were the employees. The whole experience was just kind of underwhelming, nothing there to make we want to visit again. I think I'm so in love with the perch at Old Carolina Barbecue during Lent every year that this was just no comparison."}
{"text":"This review is based on a Friday night fish special.

They have a fried perch dinner mon/wed/fri.  I'm not sure if this is all year or only during lent.  But we went on a Friday during lent on the recommendation of a friend.  

Parking can b a pain.  There is a back lot, but that fills up quick, a couple on street spots, and then you have to start parking down the side streets which is what I had to do. 

Get there early!  Apparently I'm like the only one that didn't know about this place!   And I've lived in the surrounding areas for 20 years!  It is a bit hidden off the beaten path.  We were able to snag a table for 5 just before 5(about 4:45)... The whole place by 5:10 was packed, and they do have quite a bit of seating.   

Our server was nice and served us well despite how crowded it was.   Our food also came out in a timely fashion.  

I had a house Cabernet and it was good.   The perch, oh that perch dinner...I'm STILL drooling over it!  You get to choose either a 3 piece or 5 piece.  The perch itself are nice pieces, not too wimpy as I have had other places.  The breading is perfect as is the tarter sauce to accompany it.   You choose a salad or cole slaw. I got the salad that comes on the plate with it.  Chopped Tomato/cucumber/romain all good.   Then u pick a side of either fries or applesauce.  Both fine.   I was able to try the cole slaw and it was creamy and good as well.   

Can't wait to go back for more perch and to try other stuff on menu."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends 21st birthday dinner for the first time.  We didn't have too long of a wait for a larger group of people on a busy Friday night which was nice so no complaints there.  But, then once sat and had our drink orders taken, it was a good amount of time before we were acknowledged again.  We had to get the host to get our waitress to order after approx 10-15 minutes.  Once we ordered our appetizers didn't take too long but then our food started coming out dish by dish (which is awkward in a large group) but then I noticed... I'm the only one without food!  The waitress came up to me as soon as everyone elses food and said that mine would be out soon and would be on the house.  It was nice that she addressed the situation right away and comped me without me even saying anything.  But.... I then sat there while everyone ate their entire meals and finally got my food which was overall good - not the best I've ever had but not bad.

The staff was friendly and great, the owner was pretty awesome, and it's a good local spot for an older crowd.  Probably won't be my first choice in a spot to go, but it won't be my last.  If you live in the area I would atleast try it!"}
{"text":"What's happening at the Blouvelard?  We went for wings and the place was half empty. We order hot wings and the wings we were brought were sooo hot my lips swelled. They then said someone messed up the sauce because they had same problem the day before. They brought us plain wings w sides of correct hot sauce. Later they brought out free French fries which we did not want. We ate about half our wings, they said we could take home but we did not want to take home plain wings. 
They adjusted our bill of 12 wings, 6 wings, 2 beers and a bottled water by 6wings ( which we did not eat) a whole $3.00. I guess it time to move on like most of the other patrons. The only saving grace was waitress did a fine job covering for the kitchen."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a weekend but later in the evening and were seated very quickly. We both ordered the perch.  It was good ,don't get me wrong, but a smaller portion than expected.  I am \"surprised\" how they fit everything  (fish, fries,coleslaw in its own little bowl and a little ketchup container) on a small platter dish."}
{"text":"I don't live in Cuyahoga Falls anymore, but whenever I pay a visit back home this place is second to none-my first stop from the airport.

Thursday night steak is my favorite. I'm incredibly particular about how I like meat cooked, and the kitchen gets it right every. single. time. 

Speaking of steak, the pitt salad is also fantastic. If you enjoy red meat and fries. (because, who doesnt?)

Neighborhood gem. Cuyahoga Falls staple. This is my favorite place :)"}
{"text":"They doubled the price of wings, and still make you buy a drink. I even had to buy a $2.50 drink for my 1year old, because he ate 1 wing. The price went up and quality went down. Then they charged 18% gratuity for a large party (me, my husband, a 7yo, 5yo and a 1yo). A family of 5 is a large party? When I called the manager, she acted like I was stupid and offered me a drink next time I come in. Keep your drink, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Recently returned to get wings and they upped the price to.50 a wing. They're still really good but not quite the value and service is still slow even with fewer people coming in! You might find a better value somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Boulevard a couple times a month for the past 3-4 years.   The food is very good.   I would often call and place an order to pick up.   I just called to place an order and the girl told me they don't take orders over the phone, but I could come down there and place a to go order and wait on it.   She then told me they haven't accepted phone orders i a couple of years!  She was rude and strait out lied to me because I place a phone order within the past 2 months and have about half a dozen phone orders placed this year.   Like I said, food is good, but don't know if I'll go back because of the rude person on the phone."}
{"text":"I keep giving this place another chance year after year ever since they've opened.  If you're ordering alcohol, you can expect mediocre service.  If you're not ordering alcohol, expect no service.  They should just put a sign on the door \"Order beer or stay out.\"  I'm not sure you could find worse service in Summit county than this place.  I even had a waitress tell me that the food is just there to bring people in and buy drinks, and I get that, but holy crap this place."}
{"text":"I've been there once for their Friday night perch. It was delicious! The fries and salad were also very good. Wait staff was good too. Definately plan to go again. Like the cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've heard good things. Unfortunately, today sign on door read, \"closed due to staff shortage\". Odd"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. Got the chicken salad and could barely finish half of it... The house dressing is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"a friend and i popped in for dinner and a beer and we were pleasantly surprised. the menu has your standard burgers and fries and chicken wings but there was also a great selection of salads and lebanese foods. my friend opted for the greek salad which she really enjoyed and i went for the falafel wrap and fries. YUM!

beer selection wasn't off the charts or anything but this is a nice neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Perch Dinner Review:
I've been to \"The Boulevard\" several times for the Friday Perch Dinner.  I think it's the best perch dinner around and I've been to most Friday Fish places in Akron and Cuyahoga Falls. You'll  get a decent portion of fresh perch, great bread, and your choice of two side dishes for around $12.  If you have an experienced (picky) \"perch palate\", and it's late July through September, you might prefer the fresh, Lake Erie \"jumbo\" yellow perch that are in-season and likely available as \"Specials\" at a shrinking number of other places.  Of course, compared to $20/lb (market price) for the jumbos, you'll get an essentially BOGO deal on excellent, eco-friendly, farm-raised perch at The Boulevard.  If you can eat dinner early, get here before 5:15 to avoid waiting a few minutes for a table. You'll also be more likely to get one of the limited parking spots."}
{"text":"Will think twice before returning again. Called to order a carryout for a fish dinner, 5 pc. Ask to add an extra pc.  of fish and told can only sell by the dinner , won't sell extra pc. Advertised at $12.99 , charged $14.99. Charged extra fee for carryout container. Never told ahead of time. Never heard of this, don't know of any other restaurant that charges for the carryout container. Maybe they charge extra if you eat in for the plate, so they can pay the dishwasher. Went in to pick up the order, very rude, order was sitting on the bar, only 1 bartender working, and he had a full bar.2 hostesses standing around and neither would get my order, said had to get it from the bartender, wait for him, no matter how busy he was. Told her it was just sitting there getting cold, finally got the bartender flagged down, and he took care of my order and left his bar customer waiting.  I have a really hard time trying to understand why a restaurant like this gives such bad service and yet expects to keep a good reputation. Good food, poor service!!!  Not customer oriented"}
{"text":"After monthly meeting a group of us head over to the  Boulevard  talked me into trying their wings.. impressed with wings and flavor a day of course added a beer and just a good local hang out"}
{"text":"I am giving this two stars because the service was not good, not good at all. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated at 6:50. We were told wings take 45 minutes. We were okay with that and told the waitress we'd order an appetizer and drinks since it was so long. At 7:20 the waitress came back to our table to confirm our order. She explained that while the kitchen had our order, the \"tape\" ran out and she needed to re-enter it. At 8:00 (the 80 minute mark since ordering) we flagged the waitress down to question where our order was. The table next to ours, seated after us, also ordered wings and they were long gone. The waitress said, she could not speak to that table since they had a different server. She also said because we ordered an appetizer, she could not put in our dinner order until the appetizer was served. 85 minutes after ordering our dinner began to arrive, first 2 plates, then one plate, and then several minutes later the 4th plate. The food was very good but the poor service put a real damper on the evening. The waitress knew we were not pleased but made it clear it was not her fault."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place and after reading the  yelp reviews I was anxious to try it.We weren't disappointed. Service was great and the food was outstanding. We started we the  Moroccan cigars which were seasoned wonderfully, for an entrée we both had the  filet mignon. The filets were tender and prepared perfectly. Looking forward to trying the perch!!"}
