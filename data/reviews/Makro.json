{"text":"Extremely pretentious and rude staff from the valet to the server. The decor leaves much to be desired as does the very over-priced menu. The food, once it finally arrived was mediocre.
Would not set foot in there again even if someone else was paying.
Choose to spend your money at a restaurant that truly cares about serving good food."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Reminiscent of nobu style cuisine for those who appreciate great seafood. I highly recommend the tuna tartare rice cakes and the ocupus. Our server, Vanessa, was very kind and made great suggestions."}
{"text":"I was excited to come to this restaurant because I really do like Grinder. This restaurant is located where Shinji used to be before it closed down. 

I came here last night with my boyfriend at 7 pm. It got pretty packed around 8 pm. We sat at the bar. The waitress behind the bar asked us what kind of water we wanted right away. Because we were at such close proximity to the bar and to the waitress, I felt the service was very good and pretty fast. 

I ordered the Barracuda cocktail. It's basically a Bloody Caesar with jalape√±o and an oyster on top. It wasn't spicy though. My boyfriend got the Mexican Chardonnay cocktail which consisted of cazadores reposado, martini sec, pineapple, mint and agave. It tasted lemony and not what I expected. It's a pretty drink and it's light. I think it's more a of a girl's drink to be honest. After that we had imported red wine. Mine was a Pinot noir and it was very good.  I wish the waitress had poured more of it because it didn't look like much in my glass.

We started with the spicy tartare rice cake. Basically it's tartare on five rectangular rice beds. It was so yummy! We devoured it. I'm not sure what kind of fish it was. It didn't say on the menu and I didn't think to ask. 

Then we shared two mains - the lobster and the lamb. The waitress recommended to get seafood as she said that was their speciality 
 and si for those who like meat they should just go to grinder instead. So we got the lobster because she said it was her fave on the menu and we got the lamb because we are not big on fish. 

Out of the two mains I preferred the lamb. The lobster was very Asian influenced with xo sauce and bok choy, mango and puffed rice. I don't usually enjoy Asian fusion or Asian influenced dishes because I'm half Asian and I can eat this stuff for cheap in Chinatown. 

 I was surprised that the portions were big. The pieces of lobster were huge. And the lamb dish consisted of many lamb chops. The lamb chops were expensive! $70 for like 6 chops! The lamb came with pomegranates seeds , eggplant, sour cream, pico de Gallo and  mint leaves. My boyfriend felt the lamb lacked flavour and salt but with the sour cream and mint I felt it was quite tasty. 

I don't think I will be back. I like grinder so much more."}
