{"text":"This place is a little more pricey than the crap next door but I got a ton of meat and noodles. I got a large Pho and my boyfriend got chicken beef and seafood on crispy noodles we both ate for two days. I told them I had a slight shellfish allergy and the owner cane up and asked told me what was and what wasn't cooked in the same oils. Told me they were very scared. It was very nice to see someone care that much ."}
{"text":"Had the vermicelli noodles with beef and the fried spring roll. It came with a good portion of noodles and okay amount of meat but the beef wasn't as flavourful as I would have liked. The spring roll was good! Spring mix was good too. But the nuoc mam/fish sauce to accompany the noodles wassuper diluted and wasn't enough to accommodate the dish. I saw some other reviews saying that the tips were included but I'm unsure if they have continued to do that. Our bill came out correctly with 13% tax. In addition, my mom had the pho and was super thirsty afterwards which is a sign of MSG."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Pho Places in Toronto. They beef is fresh and broth is amazing. I ordered the rare beef Pho with beef on the side. The high temperature of the broth cooks the rare beef just enough."}
{"text":"So far We are happy with their above average service comparing with other Vietnamese restaurant...service with a smile at least.  The chopsticks and spoons are dipping in the hot water cup....smart idea...make me feel they are cleaner....Their foods are authentic Vietnamese with reasonable price based on the generous portion that they served.  I like the Pho here, it is still hot even after you finish and Other dishes that I have tried were good too, no cutting corner like some of the restaurant serving our Canadian friends.  I will give five star if they are making the washroom area more presentable and cleaner."}
{"text":"This place has nice, cozy, and clean decor. They have two TVs on; one by the service counter at the back of the joint is playing CP24 and the one right over the entrance playing Vietnamese karaoke. I don't understand the language but really like the tune. Booth is also available which we like.

They offer delicious pho with competitive pricing. I wouldn't say it's \"dirt cheap\" but hey they take debit/credit cards here. Their menu has a wide selection, besides pho and vermicelli; Thai hot pot and congee looks really tempting.

Attentive and efficient service. 

I am very happy to find another great pho place in North York. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went there Friday afternoon, 23 March 2018 at around 13:30.  There were a fair amount of customers there, the place was clean, presentable and friendly staff.  My husband ordered the Rare Beef Rice Noodle Soup (Pho Tai), and I had the Chicken Tom Yum Soup (Sup Tom Yum Ga).  The soup I had certainly was hot and spicy, which I liked but I prefer the vegetables cooked more and softer.  If you ever talk with someone who has an ostomy, you will understand."}
{"text":"I got the P1 Pho Special XL. There was plenty of food and the quality was great. Lots of tendons, beef, bean sprouts, among others. They also take Visa!"}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday and it was really quiet and the service was adequate. 

Drinks: I started off with a cold vietnamese coffee. It tasted great. But I felt like 80% of my cup was ice cubes and there was barely any coffee for $3.50 so I will probably order the hot version next time. 

Food: My friend got the special beef pho. Nothing spectacular, it is just like any other beef pho. I ordered the grilled pork chop platter with steamed egg and fried egg. The pork chop was tender. 

The food was decent but I will NOT return based on how unethical this business is. They intentionally increase the price of the grand total when they hand you the total bill thinking that customers do not notice...

They add tips to the total of the bill without informing customers. The paper bill just says \"total\" and the total amount. It does not include any calculation. Most customers will assume this total amount is just the subtotal with taxes. But NOPE, it includes tips. This is very unethical of this business. I know they are intentionally doing it because I paid with cash, and they gave me change and it was my natural instinct to leave a tip. Afterwards I thought to myself that the \"total amount\" on the bill didn't seem very right, so I grabbed my phone out to do the calculations and I realized they actually increased the \"total amount\" written on the bill. I was already in my car when I realized I had in fact gave them tips TWICE without realizing and they accepted it. This business is very sneaky and I don't appreciate their way of doing business. I highly advise everyone to calculate the total amount on the paper bill because they definitely increase the amount."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend to have a quick meal after a couple hours on the road. The server was quick and the food came out fast (kind of expected since we ordered pho). I was pleasantly surprised when they brought out spoons and chopsticks being sanitized in hot water. I've never seen this done in a Vietnamese restaurant and really appreciated it.

Pho noodle soup (large size with tendon, beef flank, tripe):
Overall a solid bowl of pho with flavourful broth and generous amounts of beef and tendon. This was probably the most toppings I've received in a bowl of pho (and I've had my fair share of pho) and it was awesome!

Avocado shake: my go-to drink at any Vietnamese restaurant. Love the smooth creaminess when real avocados are used. The flavour of the drink was great, however I believe they made it ahead of time and froze it. The drink was not fully thawed and was too solid to drink. I ended up letting it thaw out for a couple of hours before being able to enjoy it fully. 

If you ever crave a hot bowl of pho this is a good place to get it."}
{"text":"Ordered bun bo hue after a night of drinking and it completely satisfied my cravings and hangover. It was delicious and portion was great. Service was unfriendly though. No thank you or anything when I paid. Woman at the front seemed annoyed and was just very hostile. However the food was amazing which is enough to bring me back!"}
{"text":"We went to Pho Tien Phat last weekend to have dinner and this was the worse restaurant ever that we have eat in Toronto.  I order a beef noodle soup and it was o.k.  the waitress bought it to me and it was warm so I asked her if i could get some hot soup to pour it in my bowl she gave me a dirty look and say to me that I should just eat it.  The washroom was so smelly and dirty...I guess no one was cleaning it up...you can smell the washroom odor from the dining room.  I saw a few cockroaches, I am not sure how they pass the city restaurant inspection.   Last time we will eat here....Horrible experienced."}
{"text":"Very delicious
Really clean
Cute decor
Washrooms are pretty they are down two flights of stairs, very scary."}
{"text":"This is a regular go-to place for a colleague and I from work.

Pluses:
Noodles are of a good quality.  Pho is not salty.  Customer service: efficient, but polite.  Clean place.

Slight negative:
PLEASE cut your chicken into smaller pieces in the pho ga.  I had to open my mouth HUGE in order to get them in!

Seriously, this is a pleasant place.  Not the best pho that I have ever had, but definitely very acceptable and the quality of the ingredients, top."}
{"text":"Just landed and wanted to grab something to eat. Yelp this place and it said it closes at midnight. Arrived at 11pm and the door and lights were shut off. Call before you come here. Made that mistake. Wasted money on uber"}
{"text":"Customer service here is amazing. Very nice. Menu is ghetto. But the food is great and the service. Compared to the ones in the area."}
{"text":"This is my go to pho place at any given time. Their food is so amazing and delicious, not to mention it tastes authentic as well. 10/10 would recommend this restaurant to any first-timers or even well experienced customers. The food is just so tasty."}
{"text":"My new regular pho joint in the North York area, that's pho sho. (I was told that this was a lame pun so hoping someone will find this slightly funny?!)

One of the better Vietnamese establishments in the area - make sure you're going into the right restaurant and not the other Viet place right next to it! Clean interior but only about 10-12 tables inside this place, however, ample parking located at the plaza.

They serve your authentic Vietnamese fare - pho is great and even their smallest bowl will fill ya up for only ~$6. The one exceptional thing you must try here though is their Bo 7 Mon (7 course beef). For about $29, it's meant for 2 people but definitely more than enough to share with 3. They don't skimp on ingredients and is by far the best 7 course beef meal I've had in a Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto - sadly I was starving every time I've ordered it here so no photos, yet!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing place, super authentic! Love the wraps, the two of us ordered for three and finished everything. Highly recommend if you want an authentic Vietnamese experience.

Honestly it was a five star review in the beginning however........the business was being very unethical, for a party of two, they included the tip in the total of the bill without telling us. It was literally a hand written slip that shows you 'total = $XX.XX' no where does it tell you a tip was added. My friend ended up paying two tips. We didn't figure this out until we were en route home. The food was great but this unethical act left a sour taste in our mouth....."}
{"text":"Love love love the broth here. For someone who could eat pho 3 days in a row and not complain, this is my go to spot for pho in the area. And once you're done, you can walk next door and get your nails done. There, I planned out your next event. 

Also appreciate the fact that they bring out your utensils in a cup of boiling water, for all you germaphobes out there. 

And might I add, it's not a cash only place??? (You have to spend over $10 to use your card, but still)"}
