{"text":"The servers in this place are great they all know what they're doing and are very nice. The food is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed. And the food comes fairly fast. I love this place definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I've noticed the low ratings but have to say that I've had pretty good experiences here so far. It is hard to get excellent service for a family of 6 but I've had good experiences here.   We normally have breakfast meals and have been satisfied for the most part (as most other places, they can cut down in the amount of butter added with griddle items).  Finally, I thoroughly enjoyed the French fries-- I'm sure they use the same oil for shrimp & chicken strips-- just a nice balance of flavor."}
{"text":"I really appreciate something that never changes.  Perkins has been the same since I was in high school.  I would ditch class with my girlfriend and we'd come and drink coffee and split the appetizer sampler or the chicken fingers melt.  In fact, the only thing that has changed is that there is no longer a smoking section in the back.  Breakfast is good- French toast and bacon, eggs Benedict, build your own omelets- actually typing about it is making me long for it tremendously.  The appetizer sampler is still a compellation of tasty fried nonsense, but it is satisfying.  I like the idea that you can order an entire pie and eat it at the table.  I've never done so, but I have seen it done.  The only word to describe the service is: fine.  I believe they're still open 24 hours, and I'm noticing that I must have an affiliation for that characteristic.  Good food any time, as long as you realize that you're eating at a Denny's in disguise."}
{"text":"I was at this Perkins about a month ago and was not happy But thought I would give it another try. The first time the table wasn't clean, waitress had to be told twice her order was up because she was talking to  co worker and not paying attention, and I had to go to the counter to get my bill. Again the service was very slow. The waitress said she would be right back twice, then went to another table to take their order. I got up and left but the manager was standing at the front counter and didn't even look up until I said the service was real slow and his response was \"REALLY\". Both times this place was not busy and if they are open 24 hours then they need to staff it properly. Needless to say I will never go back again. I went to Denny's and had a nice dinner, with good food and fast service!"}
{"text":"When hubby and I crave for comfort food like country fried steaks, pancakes, or pies, we go to Perkins! The menu has nothing fancy; it's just good homestyle cooking."}
{"text":"Was staying at the comfort inn next to Perkins and the clerk told me they gave 10% off for guests. I figure I'd get a late night burger and I wasn't disappointed. I called and ordered. It was coming off the grill in the time it took me to walk over. Burger was good and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Now that I have kids, Perkins has become our #1 favourite restaurant. It's got lots of selection with good quantity. The quality, is not high end gourmet, not at all, but it's a simple meal at a good price. Think, Dennys, if Dennys was actually good. Kids eat free on weekends which is great. There's plenty of selection to cater to whatever mood you may be in.  Basically, it's just a casual family bakery restaurant. Like an all American type place. Home cooking style, except you don't have to do it , haha. All in all, I've always left satisfied."}
{"text":"If you don't know about Perkins, give it a google.  This is a franchise chain type thing.  Really a slightly nicer version of Denny's, with all that entails (paying at the register.  The pie counter.  The mega menu with lots of inserts and featured specials.  Menu pictures that look delicious and nothing like what you actually get served).  And I know your ass has been to Denny's, so I'm not saying anything else.    My dining companion (hey sexy) and I eat here every now and then.  I want someone to explain something to me.  Ready?  Here it goes:  WHO ARE ALL THE DAMN PEOPLE EATING AT PERKINS AT 11pm on WEEKDAY?  Where do you all come from?   I mean, you're not high school kids, or college kids.  You're real people, lots of husbands and wives.  What kind of fucking jobs do you do?  Is that your day off?    Please, I thought dinner time in the midwest was 6pm sharp.  Who are you fucking people?"}
{"text":"It was good! I got the chicken fingers with fries, chicken was nice and tender, fries were really good! i would go back"}
{"text":"We always have a great meal here. .i love breakfast anytime and they do that!  We also don't eat pork and most all breakfast restaurants serve bacon ham sausage all pork but Perkins is ahead of the game and has yummy flavorful chicken sausages!, Thank you Perkins for thinking of everyone!  We also love their turkey dinners. .stuffing cranberry sauce! I ask for extra and hubby gives me his too!  Cranberry with a bit of turkey yum! Mashed taters and gravy on all.  He has veal cutlets too i think and every meal has been a great. .pie too!  If we have room that is!  Nice family atmosphere not cramped love the choice of a booth!  Servers friendly."}
{"text":"They have the best pancakes.  Service is hit or miss as is the food, but I love their pancakes.  They have a kids menu with good variety and evenings where kids eat free."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with fantastic service, try the Sunrise burger. The coffee is fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"Very nice waitress. The Chef Salad is not on the menu any longer but they graciously made a delicious one for me."}
{"text":"Dry burger.  No kick in the kickin' chicken sandwich.  The food took a very long time to come out. Kid's pancakes were ok, I guess.  I like the carafe of coffee they left on our table.  If you are in transit and looking to eat outside the airport, there are a lot better places on Barlow trail than this place."}
{"text":"I come here frequently at late hours due to work schedules (not an irritable drunk)! The servers work very hard, but on shifts after 8PM they are abysmally understaffed. Therefore, expect to wait 15-20 minutes for your order to be taken."}
{"text":"Who knew this late night restaurant would have such a d......good chicken sandwich?!! Sorry KFC but I found a new love in my life so GOODBYE!   Wowww....I have been at this fully renovated location twice already and I have ordered the chicken strips melt, what a wonderful discovery ladies and gentlemen, since I tried it the first time I keep craving it......it is crispy chicken strips (when they say crispy they really mean it, the right way though, not the dry kind that cracks your mouth) applewood smoked bacon (also nice and crispy), pepperjack cheese and a chipotle ranch dressing, should I say more?? It comes in a sourdough bread (which is good) but as a personal preference I ask for whole wheat bread........but wait!.....I haven't finished yet, please ask for sweet potatoes fries as your side, without a doubt, they are such a wonderful surprise, they are all crinkled, so crispy with a soft sweet potatoe mash in its natural form on the inside, you can even see the little strings the sweet potatoe has, they reminded a little bit of thanksgiving ;) The staff has been very nice also both times I have been there."}
{"text":"Perkins omelettes look exactly like they do in the picture on the menu -- like plastic.  They actually taste pretty good (not great), but the entire manufactured notion of the food preparation at this chain creeps me out, and makes me wonder how processed their ingredients are.  The food is average, and it's a great place to go if you're searching for a 24-hour spot.  The prices seem a bit high for diner fare, perhaps in part because they include extras like muffins or toast with their meals.  The service is good and it's clean, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Terrible service, waited an hour and a half for cold food which came after people who have gotten there after us started leaving because they'd already gotten their food. The waitress handed us food that was touching her shirt, not to  mention that she was all sweaty. By far the worst Mother's Day brunch we've ever had. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for breakfast and let me tell you it's my fave. If you want breakfast try the tremendous twelve. The wait is about 10 to 15 on the weekend mornings but it is worth it. I can not speak for the dinner service but check it out if you are in the mood for a solid breakfast!  You will find a large percentage of people who are here on the weekend are senior or regulars."}
{"text":"I was just there this morning.  I asked them if they had wifi because I had some work to do and they said yes, they had free wifi.  After I ordered, I opened up my laptop and decided to get connected but it was not working.  The nice server said that they would need to reboot it.  10 minutes later, nothing yet.  The server said it takes a while for the system to reboot.  20 minutes later, no internet and no work done.  Do not come here if you are looking for a wifi connection.  The food was so-so... I ordered my eggs over medium and they came runny.  Other than that, the server was very nice!"}
{"text":"I came here last Sept.25. My server is so rude, I ordered HEARTY MAN COMBO, I was supposed to get a pancake instead of the toast and I told him to please change it to pancake and he told me with not so nice tone \"You have to pay for it because it's served already\" and I said Sure I will pay for it because I was really craving for a pancake that day. So he went to the Kitchen and then he came back to my table and TOOK THE 4pcs. OF TOAST FROM MY PLATE WITH BARE HANDS AND NOT EVEN SAY ANYTHING. Is he not supposed to say Excuse me or something nice? I was holding my temper that time. It's my birthday and I didn't want to ruin it. Hope the supervisor will teach the servers specially Husseini tons of manners or to remind them to be always nice to customers. Im not sure of his name but that's what it is shown on my receipt."}
{"text":"This place has typical  greasy, heavy, diner food. The serving sizes are huge, which would be nice if the food wasn't heavy enough already. The service was fine, but I was left feeling guilty after only eating a little bit of my dish."}
{"text":"How shall I start this?  For starters, the customer service was the worst I have ever encountered. Buddy bitched when a few tables didn't leave him a tip, maybe he should try smiling and be nicer in demeanour. Next, the fountain Coke taste like carbonated water and seriously taste like soap with colour. The tap water had more taste. We both ordered the Harty mans meal, the only thing good and not from box was the eggs. Hash browns and tatter totts were over done, smoked sausage was burnt beyond recognition. Like come on, try cutting thru smoke burnt sausage with a butter knife. Ain't happening! Bacon was so greasy that even after patting it down with our only 2 napkins, still was dripping. Pancakes were from box, aunt jamima batter and to salty.  After telling buddy to take it back and wanted a refund, he told us we couldn't have one. That's when I ordered to speak with management. In all fairness the manager refunded us back $5.00 and let us pick about $6.00 of goodies from the dessert menu. He excuse buddy's shity customer service and begged forgiveness. We paid the bill thanked him and decided never again.  Steer clear, worst place to eat."}
{"text":"I stay at a hotel across the street usually around 3 times a week and I always get a to-go order here. The food is always excellent and cheap, the staff is always nice to chat with as well. And they are open 24/7 pretty hard to beat."}
{"text":"Genuinely nice waiters and waitresses, and good food for the price that you pay. This place is always busy (even though there are no reviews yet for it!) lots of older folk frequent this place, but if you don't mind that and like breakfast foods then this might be a good brunch place for you."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and since they built the new restaurant this year, service has been pretty good."}
{"text":"If you go here for the muffins only,  it's 5 star. The food is never as good as I want it to be.  The cheese in the ham and cheese omelet seemed processed and the ham seemed canned.  The turkey is processed butterball. Stick with the bakery."}
{"text":"Rubbish service, crap tasteless food, don't waste your time or money..."}
{"text":"Very good for breakfast. Service has always been quick and friendly. I've tried several items off of the breakfast menu and the food is good and always served hot. No complaints. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Perkins always remind me of my childhood in Winnipeg, going their for breakfast. Since I have grown-up in Calgary, there wasn't as many Perkins here as there was in Winnipeg, so nevery really got to eat there often.  I went there a few weeks ago with my cousin as we were just driving by and starving. We were seated right away, but in a booth that was a little too dated, that probably needed to be replaced (big hole on the side covered in duct tape) As hungry as we were, we had some trouble decieding what to get. Not because of lack of option, there were too many to choose from. I ended up getting a burger with fries and a side of gravy. The serving size was perfect, waste even able to finish it all. The food tasted good as well. The gravy wasnt the best and was a little cold, but with hot fries, it didnt bother me. We were checked on twice from our server and drinks were refilled before they were even empty, which I like.  Overall, it was just okay. If your looking for a cheap, sit down lunch, this place is a-okay!"}
{"text":"Waited for 45 minutes for food to arrive and food is not up to the mark of $  we are spending"}
{"text":"Always impressed.  Their menu changes and I try different dishes and I am always happy with them.  Staff are happy.  They are like a Denny's but not greasy at all.  They should have everyone with kids sit on one side.  That way they can all cry and yell together while the other people trying to have grown up conversations are not bothered.  HA!  Lots of parking.  They need more pie.  yum!"}
{"text":"Like similar chain restaurants, you know what you're getting when you go to Perkins.     It's been almost 15 years since I last darkened the door of a Perkins and - if I remember correctly - that one was in Denver off Colorado Boulevard.      After being told at the nearby Walmart Lube Center that I was in for a two hour wait, I decided to have breakfast at Perkins and walked a block or two to get there.    At 715 am on a Saturday it was not busy but had a decent amount of groups of older friends and what looked like a dozen-strong book club or prayer group  crammed around a large table.    The menu is large and I settled on a special Bacon Tater omelette that came with hash browns (Holy potatoes, Batman!).   Pancakes were also included and when I asked the server if they had pumpkin pancakes that I could sub in for an upcharge, she looked at me for a long minute (I wasn't sure if she was stroking out?) and then offered a flat \"no.\"   Just that one word.   Hilarious.   Once the food arrived, it was perfectly fine.   Acceptable.  Tasty.  But not outstanding.  The server also warmed up a bit and became more pleasant.     My only issues were these.   The syrup containers were splattered with syrup.   Those bad boys should be cleaned before every customer and secondly I was given a nearly empty ketchup bottle.   So, overall.  Perkins is OK."}
{"text":"There are few restaurants in Champaign-Urbana that are open 24 hours. There are the Merry Ann's/Merry-Ann's/Mary Anne's diners, but you don't feel super comfortable there with grease in the air. I love Merry Ann's diner food, but Perkin's just feels homier.   I've gone to Perkins in the middle of the night to get work done; order a snack and bottomless coffee. It's quiet, the booths are cushy, and there's pie if you need some sugar for energy."}
{"text":"This is so below average. The restaurant decor is out dated and worn out.  Poor service below average breakfast and how do you even screw up breakfast. Manager asked how was everything I said \"just ok\"he said ok did not inquire. Food did not have quality flavor it was very bland."}
{"text":"Years ago this wasn't such a bad place to eat. It has since, gone down the drain! It took way too long for our order to arrive, about 45 minutes. I had family visiting and they wanted to go here.. My child got the mac n cheese and it was terrible. Tasted of cheap store brand mac. It was dry and a weird orange color. I got eggs and hashbrowns which  were bland and overpriced. Not very filling either. My whole family was disappointed with the food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I think this was the worst service I've ever had I went out with a friend after a movie it was about 10 o'clock we ordered and got our drinks service was slow I'd finished my iced tea and when my food came the waitress said she was going to refill it three-quarters of the way through my food about a half-hour later I finally get my iced tea my friend asked for more gravy and that took 20 minutes and we decided not to wait any longer they weren't busy so there wasn't really any excuse the omelet that I got was small and overpriced my friend was so mad she didn't even wait for me she walked out the whole experience was just terrible and I definitely won't go back"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch at Perkins off the west belt-line today. Service was good food was delicious.  Had the chicken soup 1/2 turkey sandwich and salad. Would recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a negative rating! This place I would NOT recommend ever. The service was extremely slow for an almost - empty restaurant. The manager was rude and the food was subpar ( I've been to much better Perkins in the past). We should've just went to a drive-thru and called it a night!"}
{"text":"Traveling and wanted to get some lunch, 2:40pm. Not many diners but plenty of staff. Some just talking, one sweeping. No one would wait on us and after 15 minutes we left. On our way out they offered us muffins."}
{"text":"Perkin's has had a lot of unremarkable ratings and I have to admit, almost embarrassingly, that I come to Perkin's the most for brunch.  I *only* come to Perkin's for brunch. Or, for dinner when I want to have brunch for dinner.  It's super busy for brunch on the weekends but you never need to wait long for a table.  Perkin's is a great place to go after a night of partying and when you're starving because their portions are quite large.  THEY HAVE THE BEST PANCAKES EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! They are so delicious and light and fluffy and it comes with the most heavenly whipped butter. I also LOVE their shredded hashbrowns. They also have regular hashbrowns. The eggs and bacon/sausage are just fine and average. They always make my bacon how I love it--crispy.  When you order a coffee, they bring you an entire carafe of coffee! Hello!!! Does it get any better than that?!  They are always happy to split the bill for you and you pay at the front.   You really can't lose at Perkin's. It's not in a trendy location, mind you, so that may be a disadvantage. I really can't believe there's only one Perkin's in Calgary!"}
{"text":"This Perkins by far has the best hashbrowns.  The staff is always friendly to us no matter what time we show up."}
{"text":"Our visit was nothing short of terrible. My eggs benedict came out cold, so I sent it back. When I got a new plate, it was still cold - a feat I thought was impossible. My boyfriend's meal didn't come out with the rest of the table's food. They decided to give us 20% off (two whole dollars). When the manager asked us how our experience was when we went up to pay, we told her. And she proceeded to ignore us. Not sure I have anything good to say about this place. I guess the tea was alright."}
{"text":"Really slow service..... I ordered breakfast carry out while passing through town.  Not only did my order take long, it sat on a shelf behind the counter until I got up and asked if that was my order.  It's not like they were busy and the staff was overworked.  There were 3 young employees having a sidebar conversation about school during my wait.  None of them were attentive or seemed concerned that I was standing there for 17 minutes.  No wonder the nearby McDonalds with their reheated food menu has higher ratings than this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service, staff is super nice, we were seated right away on a busy Sunday breakfast /lunch time. The restaurant is clean and they turn tables quickly. Our server, Bette, was attentive and fast with the drinks and checking to see if everything was ok  We ordered pulled pork breakfast burritos and southern chicken breakfast biscuits. Wow, there was so much food and everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to eat. Food is frozen and microwaved as expected. If it's late and you have been having fun? Why not. But definitely not somewhere I'd pick over anything else."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My family and I have been coming there for many many years. The food is always consistently perfect and the staff are some of the kindest you will meet. (ESP Micheal) but we love them all."}
{"text":"This review is for the banana cream pie we picked up to bring to a picnic today. We were pretty skeptical of going after seeing all the awful reviews but took a chance. My boyfriend and I miss the banana cream pie we used to pick up from Marie calendars in California and hoped this would be a similar substitute. The lady that rung me up was so friendly and reassured me the pie would be great. It turns out we had a hit item at the picnic we went to. Everyone kept talking about the pie as we were making our way through the savory main dishes. And boy did it disappear fast. The pie was just as delicious as Marie's. Still skeptical on dining in though..."}
{"text":"Well, The pie is good. The coffee is good. The restroom was gross. But they did have lots of parking. My breakfast was 75% correct. As the Yelp 2 Star rating says: Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Not so good. Eggs were overcooked, I could not chew the whites, and the hash browns were burned on the outside and raw inside. Come here for desserts only, not breakfast. The service was excellent and friendly and the restaurant was clean. Prices were quite high, three eggs and hash browns was $14.00 with coffee."}
{"text":"5:30pm on Wednesday, May 10 The food was plentiful, good and reasonably priced.   Service just ok.   The bathrooms smelled like urine, the floor was sticky and looked like it hadn't been mopped in a month.  After I mentioned it to our server, nothing was done about it.   There also seemed to be a sewer gas issue in the foyer.  How unfortunate.   I had gone to the Perkins on Tiedemann and had the same understaffed experience."}
{"text":"Found this via Yelp; mixed reviews but we were hungry and didn't feel like driving more than we already had. Located across the street from main entrance to Univ. of Illinois in a sad, worn down neighborhood. Restaurant is older and could use more lighting. Refills were slow to come (ok, not at all). Our waitress laid her arms on the table while she took our order, commenting on her lack of a break and no food all day.  I know this is not the Ritz but server etiquette should still exist. Food was well done/seasoned and that was the main thing, else this would be 2 stars. Won't return."}
{"text":"To begin with, I wish Yelp! would change the meaning of the stars.  Two stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and three stars jumps to \"A-OK.\"  Perkins is somewhere in between.  The menu for breakfast seems pretty extensive.  I ordered a platter that included smoked sausage (greasy), sausage (greasy and bland), eggs (done okay), bacon (spot on), breakfast potatoes (pretty good), and pancakes (so-so).  I like that they leave a pot of coffee on the table, rather than having you wait for refills from the wait staff.  It would have been even better if the pot was full and the coffee was good, neither of which was the case.  My waitress was efficient and personable.  Seemed more like a pro waitress rather than some of these student types that serve with the attitude that says, \"I'm only doing this until I graduate and start my money-making career, so don't expect much.\"  Again, not all student wait staff are like that but some are.  The place seemed clean and it wasn't very busy for a Saturday morning breakfast.  I've wanted to try Perkins and must admit i went there today only because Courier Cafe was closed.  I will return to Perkins, as there were some other things on the menu I'd like to try and because the experience wasn't completely a bust.  Although, I am usually a member of the Clean Plate Club, I did leave behind one piece of smoked sausage, a sausage link, some potatoes, and half the pancakes.  That says something.  SECOND VISIT: My first reaction holds true the second time.  The coffee wasn't very good.  The eggs were okay and the potatoes decent.  Bacon once again was perfect.  The muffin french toast was awful. and was left unfinished."}
{"text":"Typical American style restaurant.  By that I mean extra large quantity and lots of fried stuff.  Went there the other day for lunch and was happy to find out they serve Breakfast all day!  shared an appetizer platter that had fried spring rolls, fried cheese, fried chicken breast pieces and yes, fried string beans.    For main we each had 2 eggs, hash potatoes, fried chicken on biscuit (2 big pieces) with some white sauce. ($12.95).  Was too much, but who don't like fried food?"}
{"text":"Bacon and eggs were normal :-) Table was dirty as usual. They give a carafe of coffee, awesome!"}
{"text":"This is NOT the place to go for your lunch hour. They are incredibly slow and they really don't care that they are. We were not ready to order when the waitress asked us the first time so she said she would come back in a few minutes. Yeah, more like 20 minutes!!   I ordered the new bacon, mushroom and onion skillet and I loved it. It has an Alfredo sauce over potatoes, grilled mushrooms & onion, bacon and cheddar cheese. I know it sounds like a heart attack on a plate but it was so good. I had a blueberry muffin also and it came out hot with butter on the side.   Although I was very pleased with the meal the reason I am giving such a low rating is for the service. I ran out of water and was looking for my waitress to ask for more. It took a really long time for her to show up again. It also took more than a half an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen after we ordered. With only an hour for lunch that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I had a giant Raspberry Cream muffin in the morning with a piping hot cup of coffee.  What a great start to a good morning.  They serve \"mammoth muffins\" for around $2.30.  They had the typical kinds like Banana Nut, but also Cranberry Nut and Carrot, which I really wanted to try but I couldn't imagine that cream cheese frosting sitting too well at 8am.  Another time.  Their muffins are big... I guess \"mammoth\" sized, but instead of an insanely gigantic muffin all I can picture is an adorable woolly mammoth.  Anyways, I thought the muffin was cream-filled, but it came with a mini scoop of butter on the side.  Not the same, and I didn't slab it on.  It tasted great the way it was.  With a cup of coffee my breakfast was within $5.  By the way their pies and cookies are amazing, especially their FRENCH SILK pie.  All I've had here are their desserts and that is fine by me!"}
{"text":"Manager should be fired, fired, fired.  Staffing is horrible.  My family and I came in at 1030 at night after a long day at the ICU visiting a sick relative. There were probably 10-15 people in the restaurant. The couple in front of me were able to get get a seat however, when she came back to seat us, the hostess told us we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated because they only had one server. I said there was no way I can wait around with a tired, cranky, and hungry 3 year old.  It did not help.  How about hiring some more folks??? Anyway, that was enough to keep me away forever. On a positive note, they do give a military discount.  They get the 2 stars for that."}
{"text":"What you are about to read is a true story.  \"Welcome to Perkins, what can we get for you?\"  \"Hi!  I'd like to order the chicken fingers.\"  \"Sorry, we're out of chicken.\"  \"You're out of chicken?\"  \"Yup.\"  \"Okay... how about a bowl of ice cream.\"  \"Sorry, we're out of ice cream, too.\"  \"You're out of ice cream and chicken?\"  \"Yup.\"  \"Okay... do you have any French Fries left?\"  \"Yes, we do.\"  \"Alright, I'll have that.\"  (comes back after a while with the fries)  \"Great, can I have a fork for this?\"  \"Sure.\" (comes back after a few minutes) \"I'm sorry, we're out of forks.\"  \"You're out of forks???\"  \"Yeah, sorry...\"  I don't care what the food tastes like, but if an establishment runs out of forks, there is something wrong."}
{"text":"The mood was for an american breakfast, so Perkins was on the way from where we were coming. Hence, we stopped by to have a big breakfast.  The start was excellent as there is a huge parking and the place is quite big. We walk in and lined up to be seated and were found a place easily. From here it was all down hill for me, as I experienced one of the worst customer service possible.  The server was not friendly and all about tips with bad service. He put the menu on the table for us to make a selection and left.  We ordered scrambled eggs with pancakes and Classic Eggs Benedict and told him if we can get some water as he didn't bring it earlier. As he was caring more things and our 2 glasses of water in one hand, the water was dripping out on to his fingers and leaving darker dirty finger marks on the glass.   The food was here after a bit of waiting and the scrambled eggs with pancakes were fine but the Classic Eggs Benedict had peameal bacon or ham slices (I don't eat pork so I am not sure which one was it) in between the egg and toast. I inquired and the waiter argued it said in the menu and will not making me a new one, all he will do is take it out and bring the same plate. He had already taken the menus away and I was not able to check it, as he kept arguing it being on the menu.  Below was the extract from the menu online and there is no mention of meat in the eggs, I have also brought in the * comment.  ===== Classic Eggs Benedict* A traditional favorite served with choice of hash browns or breakfast potatoes and choice of fruit or Mammoth Muffin®.  *NOTICE: Eggs served over easy, basted, poached, sunny-side up, or soft boiled and hamburgers and steaks that are served rare or medium-rare may be undercooked and will only be served upon the consumer's request if permitted by health department regulations. Whether dining out or preparing food at home, consuming raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish or eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness. ======  I lost my appetite from then onwards and when we paid he was expecting a tip. He didn't see any tip on the receipt and just walked away without acknowledging and angry.   It is sad to see a good restaurant going downhill even the greasy spoons fixup or change anything wrong in the meals."}
{"text":"We had been coming here for a while and it's been getting progressively worse, but this most recent visit probably put us off this Perkins in Middleburg Heights for good. Food was terrible. Eggs were cold, biscuits were too chewy and slightly stale. Service was even worse. It took forever to get a hostess to seat us, forever to get our order taken, forever to get our food, and even longer to get our check. Hardly an apology from this cranky wait staff."}
{"text":"Two important words.  \" bacon fest\"   they had some bacon themed new menu items so I did not look at the rest of the menu.  Went with a pan scramble sort of thing that came with bacon gravy strips of bacon eggs and tater tots.   quite good.  Would have been better with traditional chunks of potatos. And was b bit salty. But over all satisfying"}
{"text":"Its Perkins. I keep my expectations in line.  If we are looking for something better than fast food and we don't want to spend much we come here. There is a large menu with lots of variety."}
{"text":"The Southwest omelet was fresh and hot, perfect for breakfast.  The chicken and egg was hot, the fruit dish fresh, and the toast hearty and not pre-buttered.   The onion garnish was perfectly grilled, and the light trace of sour cream added flavor without overpowering.   Service was friendly and efficient.  Update.  We had not been back in over a year, which is itself a kind of rating...neither of us had missed it, nor remembered it as being a 'go-to' destination.  We went because we happened to be in the area.   The staff on this Sunday morning was efficient and attentive, but the underlying attitude towards food quality was unclear.   The fruit side dish, which was so remarkably fresh in my first review, contained a partially rotten strawberry clearly visible to the server.  The waitress promptly replaced the bowl with what looked like the same dish, sans strawberry; but the remainder of the fruit still looked like yesterday's leftovers, including strawberry juice diffused into the cantaloupe.  She politely reassured us that 'strawberries go bad quickly'.  True, but even a so-so chef would cut out and remove the rot, and a so-so server would never deliver it to a guest.  And a good restaurant would only serve fresh fruit.  The manager agreed with us as well...but he seemed to be neither surprised nor alarmed.    On a side note, Mrs. B. is working off some heartburn from the corned beef hash.  My omelet was adequate albeit a bit salty, but clearly unlike the one that prompted my original review.   This review averages the original 4-star with a 2-star; I doubt there will be a third visit."}
{"text":"My son had games in Cleveland... and thought we could eat here and burn some time. He has to be at games 1 hour and 30 minutes before and the rink was 11 minutes away. It took them 40 minutes to get breakfast food out to us.. and then we realized we had no utensils.. waiter Eric was huffy and said \"they should have been there when you were seated\" .. well their not!!! We finally get them .. scuff down our $40 breakfast for 3... yeah expensive.. and now we need a receipt like yesterday.. .. so finally I was going to wait that the waiter Eric may or not be around in the near future... so I got a receipt.. bad service old food!!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times now and they have been pretty consistent with their service and food. I've been here when they were really busy and food took longer to get to the table, However, they did let us know, but at that capacity it should be expected. The most recent time I was here it wasn't too busy and there were only a couple servers so the food was quick, but there wasn't much service at all.  My favourite thing about Perkins is their Tater Tots! Because of my love for Tater Tots, I have tried the Big Bacon Smasher and the Big Country Smasher, and both were delicious! I have also tried the Southern Fried Chicken Biscuit Breakfast and thought it was good, very filling. There was too much biscuit for me, but I enjoyed the combination of everything on the plate. I have tried, and really like their Mediterranean Omelette. The last time I got the Chicken Strips sandwich with Tater Tots and ate half so it was good for a lighter lunch.  They have a very big menu so there is always something new to try! I also like that if you order a coffee, they bring you a whole carafe. Makes it easier than waiting for a refill.   The location is great as it's close to the airport. I usually end up here for breakfast with the family when I fly in or out of Pearson."}
{"text":"Came here a few times very early in the morning after work.   At that location were almost no customers during my few visits around that time.   With that being said, the service was fast.   Yet, to me, the food seemed good, but it isn't all that great. I ordered from the breakfast menu.   The deserts were also not that great, like the milk shake, it tasted more like a \"water-shake\" then rather creamy.   It's a nice spot to go to around here, because nothing is really open overnight or very early in the morning.   Great and fast service, however."}
{"text":"A couple of nights ago we had a business meeting at Perkins. I guess we were all tired and just didn't have the energy to traipse around town looking for fine dining. So Perkins it was.   I have to start by telling you that our server was EXCELLENT. She was on the ball with everything and extremely friendly. To be completely honest, I didn't have high expectations going in, but because of her fantastic service, our server made me rethink my impression of Perkins.   Their menu per se doesn't have a whole lot vegetarian on it that isn't breakfast. I asked our server to get the kitchen to make me a wrap and they did. The wrap was alright. Nothing to write home about, but the fact that they custom-made it for me was a nice touch.   The prices were reasonable and the environment was okay. Nothing fancy, kinda like a diner meets a Smitty's, but it did the job.   Overall, Perkins turned out to be a bit better than I thought! Like I said, the service was great and the overall experience was okay.   I may not go back any time soon, but I probably wont hesitate as much as I did initially if I end up there in the future."}
{"text":"I had thee BEST waitress EVER here!!! I mean she did everything to keep our kids happy!! You sometimes need a person who is naturally friendly and warming to appreciate your meal. The food was good and inexpensive I will be back. Especially, since I know kids eat free on Wednesdays and Saturday after 3pm that's just a double bonus lol."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled and it looks great!  The restaurant itself just completed a much needed facelift yesterday. Food is your typical Perkins fare. Not the best food you've ever eaten but not horrible either. The staff is very friendly and fun to interact with, so that and the remodel gets them an extra star."}
{"text":"I grew up going here, loved it as a kid. Maybe it's nostalgia...but it is still a favorite. Nothing special, kind of similar to Denny's...but if you are near by, it is reasonable."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. A whole cherry pie at midnight. Can't beat that.  Don't eat anything else here."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant the food is very good. The staff are generally friendly & helpful. On weekends go early or late they get very busy"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. I come here everytime I am in the area. It can get quite busy and the service slows. I love the hashbrowns! The muffins are ginormous. Decently priced breakfast for the portion you get."}
{"text":"Always good food! Service is good most of the time. Wish they brought back mini chimis"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. But the staff and customer service really needs to improve to make this place better. We had a waiter that pretty much made it obvious that he either didn't like his job or he didn't want to serve us. but anyways, I wasn't really bothered by the slow and unenthusiastic service....I understand, maybe he had a bad day. I felt bad that he had to deal with the family behind us who pretty much got fed up that they weren't getting serviced... One of the customers then went on to make a pretty racist comment, saying that the waiter clearly didn't know English (when really he only had an accent... Which has nothing to do with the slow service). The restaurant  kind of tried to make the situation better by giving one of the plates of food on the house but I feel like this just encourages rude behaviour from customers. I really hope they can get their act together in terms of the customer service here because the food is great but if the service is poor then it just makes the whole experience unpleasant"}
{"text":"I went to the Farmers Market on the square in Painesville and wanted somewhere to sit, read and eat lunch. Car GPS says Perkins is a mile away!  Lived here over a year and never knew that. It is tucked away on a very quiet part of Mentor Ave. Service is nice and friendly. Food would do the chain proud. In my last two visits we have had lemon blueberry pancakes, fish and shrimp and half a ham swiss sandwich w chicken noodle soup and chocolate French silk pie. Plus I took muffins home last week. Every bit of it was delish!  I will say the broth in the soup was loose gelatin thick but it still tasted good!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The server had an awesome attitude (a little awkward - may not always match the customer but he tries!). The food is typical for a Perkins...filling but nothing special.   My tip: make sure your definition of over medium matches the cooks. My eggs weren't even fully over easy. Can you say \"slimy\"?"}
{"text":"Apparently Perkins is a fairly popular chain restaurant in the Midwest, but I just went for the first time this weekend. My friend and I were famished after landing in Cleveland and Perkins was the first restaurant we saw on our drive to Youngstown. My friend had been there before and said it was decent so we stopped for a bite to eat. We each got a bowl of chicken noodle soup and shared some fried santa fe appetizer. It wasn't anything special and reminded me a lot of Friday's, but it hit the spot. My friend did comment that they had amazing muffins as well, but I didn't try them."}
{"text":"I only come here late at night, so I can't speak for other times, but this place has potential as the best alternative to Merry Ann's (seriously, Merry Ann's sucks). Late night specials include half-off appetizers and pie and all you can eat pancakes. Food is good quality and tasty. Good old-timey music that you would expect from an American diner, clean facilities, warm atmosphere, pleasant decor, usually not crowded. Probably super safe too since I often see police come here for food and coffee, which is important for me since I'm a girl who comes here alone at night. Whatever gave this place such a bad overall rating is definitely not here anymore from what I can see. One of the servers, Moira, is super nice and friendly. One thing that could be a downside is that servers might leave you alone for long periods of time when it's very late, but I personally don't find that an issue."}
{"text":"Great hangover or late night food. I could eat breakfast for every meal so I love all the omelettes, pancakes, bacon and hash browns. The waitresses that have served us have put up with everyone very well."}
{"text":"Took 4 minutes of standing at the podium with the menus and what not before anyone said hi or anything and seated me. Someone must have called in. I sat at my table for ten minutes then and had a question about if the promo in the website was offered at this location. I eventually saw my server but she was busy taking plates from current diners. So I got to a total of fifteen minutes in the restaurant without my order being taken. It wasn't busy. So I left."}
{"text":"Congratulations, Perkins! You've won my award for worst food in CU.  The winner is: a 1/4\" chicken patty that spurts grease when bitten into! And said patty was definitely not a normal breast. More like old school McNuggets.  YUCK."}
{"text":"Ok, let me start off and say Ive always been a Perkins fan, I used to go to the one off East Washington so I dont want to seem like a jerk, but what happened to this one? I had breakfast today and very little was good about it. I feel bad because of all the good memories, Its too bad this wasnt one of them.  Service - Fair to good. Our waitress was very busy but attentive and nice. Food came out hot and punctual. 8/10  Food Quality - Ok, heres where I might hurt feelings. I ordered the Steak and Eggs. The goods: Bacon was crunchy and hot, and the pancakes albeit much smaller then I remember tasted great. Lots of butter. The bads: Everything else. The eggs were not scrambled, they were formed into a patty. The hashbrowns with cheese on top had a weird aftertaste (kind of bitter, soapy or something), and the steak, oh my god, was THE worst steak Ive ever attempted to eat. I am a steak fanatic so its my bad that I thought Perkins might suprise me (like Norms diner in LA, great t bone there). Nope, it was tough, tasted gamey, and soooo chewy. I spent so much time chewing everything else went cold. It was cooked to my liking its just they have horrible cuts of meat. 2/10 (0/10 without bacon and pancakes)  Price - For what I got not good at all. I paid $12 for \"steak\" and eggs and $3 for a side of bacon (4 strips). Coffee was priced well. I expect either a smaller steak of better quality then the 7oz piece of garbage I got. 1/10  Experience/Vibe - Typical of any Perkins, we weren't offered to have a booth which I think is a no brainer, some people prefer booths. A little cramped but not too bad. 6/10  Overall - 17/40  MANAGEMENT PLEASE LISTEN!!! Please your meat elsewhere. Ive never had such a tough piece of \"steak\" in my life. I am anti A1 sauce cause I like the taste of steak as it is. I actually used A1 because of how nasty I felt trying to choke this down. I can't believe you call that steak, the only way I will ever buy that false steak again is if the world ran out of dog food and my dog was starving. Even then Id feel bad for my dog and probably end up giving him the hiemlich maneuver after choking on it.  1 star, sorry Perkins, you might have just lost a customer to Dennys. Ill still patronize your bakery but as for meals I think I am done. Hire a meat manager or fire the one you have, please."}
{"text":"My friend took me here today and I'm not complaining. Got the build a breakfast with over easy eggs, turkey bacon, shredded potatoes, and buttermilk pancakes. They bring over an entire jug of coffee and leave it at your table and the pancakes are super fluffy! I was pretty much shocked when the bill came because it was only $10.95. If you want a cozy breakfast nook where you can really relax, this is the place."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service wasn't great. It took a long time to place my order, then I had to wait to eat because I didn't have silverware. I witnessed other tables having similar issues, so maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Arriving at 4:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, I was hoping no one would mistake me for a senior citizen. LOL Perkins is best known for it's breakfast food and I would recommend sticking to that. My aunt and I ordered dinner entrees and they were ok, but the breakfasts here are better. I had the grilled Alaskan cod with bacon green beans and herb rice as sides. The cod was actually dipped in flour then fried in oil which was disappointing. My other option was the battered cod and that might have been tastier with probably as many calories. The green beans were tasty too most likely because they were slathered in butter and bacon. Yes, bacon does make everything better! My aunt had the turkey dinner which looked good and she said was like having Thanksgiving dinner.   The service here tonight was disappointing. After our waitress took brought out our drinks, she disappeared. I had to ask another waitress twice if we could finally order. The meal did arrive quickly which made up for the delay in ordering.   I'm giving this Perkins 3 stars because of the poor service and the fact that the entree I had was only OK."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Perkins tonight around 7:45pm. There were very few customers so I was hoping we would have good service. Our drinks came out fast as did our food. The food was good and hit the spot. The problems came after we got our food.   Our waitress disappeared. I'm not sure if she was taking a break or busy doing other tasks but she was nowhere to be found. We were wanting to order dessert which is one of the perks of going to Perkins as they have good pie and other goodies. Unfortunately we have had this type of service in the past. We did inform the manager about our disappearing waitress.  Another problem I have with the staff is that if you order a muffin with your meal, don't expect to get dessert. The waiter/waitress will suggest that you 'probably don't want dessert' since you had a muffin. This has happened to us on multiple visits from multiple waitresses. I'm not sure if this is how they train their staff here, but it's really not a good way to run a business. I want to give them my money for more food and tip well, but they make it very difficult to do this.  I don't care if you have the best food on the planet. If your service is lousy, then it ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"Cannot list all the times over 20 years we ended up at Perkins!  After a long day at the University, as both students and staff.  In the middle of the night when neither of us could sleep.  When my in-laws had a craving for French Silk (and omg, the number of pies I bought... it's just not quantifiable!).  When the ice had brought down all the electrical, once, and the roads were sheets of ice, a death-defying trek to Perkins, who promptly saved Christmas, one year!  Whenever we couldn't make up our mind about anywhere else, the answer was always Perkins, and this location (on University) always met the call.  A warm pancake stack, with an ice cream scoop sized wad of butter melting in!  The aforementioned French Silk pie, a slice of it just as a treat.  Even their hot turkey plate-- a real Butterball turkey, slow cooked, with amazing \"fixin's\".  I mean... food doesn't have to be froo froo for me in order to be _good_, _wholesome_, and made with love.  So many meals I've had here, and I'd say that the vast majority of them have been something special!  Perkins is super reasonable on price.  The restaurant is a little dated, now, but you just _can't_ judge this book by its cover.  Because there's love underneath what they do, here, and if you can't find something to enjoy, you just aren't trying hard enough (or you're trying _too_ hard to be a snob! ;D)."}
{"text":"The hearty man combo was great I liked the seasoned potato cubes and kielbasa but I was disappointed in the bacon I received 1-1/2 strips - I guess if I was cutting down that would be satisfactory but it is the \"Hearty\" man combo ain't no cutting down here And I was pleased to find out I had a choice of pancakes - when syrup is labeled \"Maple\" I expect maple syrup but no one was sure Don't skimp on the butter either butter spread ain't the same But I liked it that on a Sunday 2 walk into a restaurant for breakfast and are seated pretty quickly Wow There was a bit of a lag between ordering and receiving our food but come on it was almost noon on Sunday I'll forgive you"}
{"text":"I came here to kill my late night craving of pancakes.   When I arrived, there was no line yet it took them four minutes to seat me at a table. Once I sat it took them another ten minutes to take my order. My pancakes took about five minutes to come out.  Pancakes were good though they weren't out of this world.  I give these restaurant a three... food was good though two points deducted due to the fact that they had me waiting in an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice decor,  good food and fast service, but the waiter was a little on the rough side for personality."}
{"text":"The food isn't great. But the never-ending pot of coffee and 24 hour schedule meant that I spent a ton of time here around finals.   Just don't be a jerk: leave a fat tip after you've been sitting in someone's section all night studying. They'll appreciate it."}
{"text":"Went there again the other night. Looking more and more rundown and the floor was filthy."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch (10am) here. I didn't want breakfast items and they have a full menu all day long. The service was fast & friendly (forgot the server's name)  Our food was excellent! Much better than we expected. We had the Monticello shrimp and the tilapia with shrimp.  The Monticello shrimp had angel hair pasta and sliced mushrooms in a creamy garlic wine sauce. The tilapia was seasoned well and served with rice pilaf and grilled asparagus. The dishes came with a side of garlic toast (that was also quite good!)  We've eaten at this Perkins before but this was the tastiest it's been (my compliments to the chef!)   2 meals + 2 coffees and our total bill was $29.   Perkins is on Bagley Rd, convenient to the I-71. Lots of parking. Restaurant is clean and inviting."}
{"text":"The food was good but there were definitely some issues. Our server was great- super nice and attentive. However the kitchen lacked. I found a hair in my food. They brought me out a new one with no problems which I appreciated, but then the grapes were dirty. When I finished, there was dirt in the bottom of the bowl. Even through all this, it still won't stop me from coming back. Like I said the food was exceptional and so was the service. I work at a restaurant so I understand. They were probably just having a bad day."}
{"text":"I picked up my friends at the airport from a late flight coming into Cleveland for a wedding and we choose to grab a bite to eat late night on a Saturday night sometime after midnight.  The place was extremely busy, however, the associate manager Eric greeted us at the door with a friendly smile and allowed us to choose a booth or table.  We had six people total with us and we waited at the door for a short wait until we sat at a combined group of tables in the back section of the restaurant away from the crowds. Eric asked us what we wanted to drink and told us our server Kristina will be right with us.  My wife asked if she could have a hot tea and Eric bought it out right away and even asked us a second time if anyone needed anything right away since my friend mentioned we just got into Cleveland on a late flight.  We felt welcome and it was nice to relax in an area not so busy as the rest of the restaurant.  Our waitress came over and was very nice and allowed us a moment to sit and talk before being rushed to order.  When our order arrived it came out all at once with Eric and Kristina both together coming to our table with our food.  They were very attentive asking if we needed refills or extra napkins.  Eric even took the time to talk to us about our hometown and talked a little about what Cleveland has to offer while in town.  I thought this was nice to go the extra mile make my party feel at home.  We ordered dessert and Kristina told us that we did not have brownies for the brownie delight but Eric brought us out the dessert so they must have been able to find some in the back.  All in all an excellent experience so late at night at this Perkins in Middleberg Heights.  I am glad we choose here and I will be back again in the am with my business clients since it is close to the airport and the staff is friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Perkins is like Denny's but less gross and I love Denny's so I super-love Perkins.  Our server, Rebekah, was very attentive, quick, and accommodating despite it being packed for brunch rush.  This isn't a fine dining place or a health store, so know what to expect. It's great for what it's trying to do.  Side note: There are these cheesecake stick things on the Sweet Starter section of the menu that are A+"}
{"text":"It's been years sine the last time I was at Perkins.  This was awesome.  Great food. Great Price. Great service.  Chocolate silk pie to die for.  I will be back for sure.  Today on the menu we had some buttermilk pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs and sausage.  However they are much more than breakfast and let me express this place was busy busy busy.  But how refreshing to have a waiter with a smile and positive attitude, because that goes a long way.  As a guest at this outing i was as pleased as one can get when the desert arrived, because all things chocolate make me a happy yelper."}
{"text":"Dont water your time with this place.  Unless you like loud lines of obnoxious people and crappy service steer clear."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Friday morning breakfast was about half full   Our server christin was fabulous! My blueberry muffin was freshly baked and Marvelous!!! The inside needs updating but it is comfortable. Bakery pies and sweets are baked in restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great once it finally came after waiting and waiting and waiting.  Then we never got the check and had to wait up front at the counter (and wait some more) until someone showed up there to help.  I don't know how they intend to stay in business if they don't have enough staff to handle five tables to 8:30am...."}
{"text":"terrible food and service would never go back ask for fresh fruit and got dark soggy fruit and found a peice of hair and my food .."}
{"text":"Wayyy too pricey for what you get. Food is just okay and portions are small. However, service is quick (even during prime breakfast hours on a Saturday) and waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"Late Monday night after the theater went to get a bite. I had the turkey triple club. It was really very good. It came with fries and I got a side salad. The fries were done perfectly and the salad was fresh and plentiful. The portion was so big I I took half the sandwich and fries home. My husband had a side salad, Reuben with onion rings. He let me try his. I wish I had taken a picture  the Reuben was stacked high with meat and the onion rings were done to perfection. Very good. I will get that next time we return!! Our server was very nice and attentive even though he was very busy. I think he was the only wait staff and he did a really good job.  They had the floor cleaner in, understandably this is a 24 hour restaurant. The guy apologized and said they have been cleaning the floors for a long time and never have seen it this busy.  We didn't mind, it was somewhat entertaining. And food and service was good."}
{"text":"We had Lunch there on a Sunday ,pretty busy . I say the food is ok not a wow but ok. The service was good and the place looked pretty clean . They got lots to pick from.  We did wait a long time for are food. The prices are not to bad either . I will give them another try maybe for dinner."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Conveniently out of lower priced meal so they can up charge!!! RUDELY REFUSED to substitute, and made snarky comment about \"other people can afford the upcharge and don't mind paying more\"...."}
{"text":"Update: After coming here a bunch of times we have still had zero issues. Service is always quick, and servers are very nice. We've had Tony as our server a bunch of times and he's always been great! The supervisor also walks around and helps his servers."}
{"text":"Perkins is a casual restaurant chain that serves American comfort food, including breakfast throughout the day.  I came here in the middle of the night because it was one of the only dining options that was still open at that time. I ordered a fried trio dish and quesadillas. Both were made fairly well considering that this is a franchise. My fried items were really crispy and satisfied my craving of sinfully greasy food. The quesadillas were way too spicy for me but my SO seemed to enjoy them. We took advantage of the half off apps deal and were able to eat for very cheap.   My major complaint is the service and the wait time. We were seated immediately but our food felt like it took ages to come out. Our server was also slow in taking our orders and bringing items we asked for to our table. The restaurant was not busy so maybe this issue can be attributed to understaffing. However, our server seemed to be really absentminded and she had to come back to our table because she forgot our order. We also had to ask her multiple times for items and ended up just borrowing ketchup from another table because the wait for her to come back was too long."}
{"text":"The waitress wasn't very friendly (huge pet peeve of mine) .. She got very annoyed when I asked her to make my omelette with real eggs instead of \"liquid\".   The food.. Spot on!!!! The breakfast potatoes were spot on and the omelette was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"A a friend and I went and the hostess when we greeted her we made a funny remark and she turned around and said I hate my job and she had absolutely no finesse she asked us if we wanted a booth or a table we said booth and she said let me go clean one off.  Then she never even walk this over to the booth she said it's right there in the front on the right hand side the food was okay and then when we went to pay the bill she never even asked us how the rest how our experience was if we like the food if there is anything wrong Chad no personality whatsoever and I believe that a Hostess makes or breaks a restaurant maybe she was having a bad day but I won't go back to that Perkins"}
{"text":"The food was truly bad specifically the potatoes... they smelled like they've been stored in a sewer. I went home and was sick for 5 hours... truly would not recommend anyone this place.  Had the eggs Benedict which was was actually two sunny side up fried eggs on top of two English muffins... That was truly laughable... they were decent but it was missing some ingredients.  I would recommend the hollandaise sauce on the side... it is awful!  They seem to have a more mature demographic coming to this restaurant... they should strongly consider the quality of their good given that their clientele seem to have various ailments...  Truly concerned on how bad the food was."}
{"text":"Nothing special Its just a big Dennys or Humptys, except you dont want to wash your jeans and the food wont make you feel like some one stimulated you pelvic splanchnic ganglion"}
{"text":"Regardless of how busy they are, we always get great service . It's a saturday morning and they are unusually busy but we had the most kind waitress Lauren ! She had no problem substituting our meals for what made us most happy. We will always return !"}
{"text":"Well, it is Perkins so the breakfast fair is pretty standard. My boyfriend and I were in town only to catch a flight at the airport since hurricane Sandy cancelled our flight out of Philly. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. But after that things were fine. I got the pumpkin pancake breakfast which was good. My boyfriend got the southern friend chicken and biscuits with gravy and they were good."}
{"text":"I want to like a place like Perkins, I really do. I like basic comfort foods and after my third crappy visit here I wont be going back.  I had a coupon for Perkins, so my coworker and I decided to go here. We got there early to avoid the lunch rush, and even at 1130 it was pretty busy. My friend ordered a wrap and salad and I had a blt with fries ( I picked the turkey out). They have virtually nothing for vegetarians. I am not 100% vegetarian, but pretty close and was disappointed in the menu and options, no veggie burger to be seen, no veggie dishes, pastas, nada, zip..  We were seated at a booth and the seat was ripped and duct taped.   Our server was Judy ( the supervisor, or so her name tag said). She was so miserable, not rude, just very \"over  it\".  As I am with servers ( having served many many years ago) I was friendly and easy to deal with...she was devoid of any emotion...it was really quite sad.. I always think that if you dont like your job, then you should something that you like...she clearly didnt seem to like her job.  The food was ok, definitely not bad for \"diner style fare\". I wouldnt go back though simply because every time I have eaten  there I left feeling bummed out....sorry Perkins but for me its been  three strikes and now you're out. :("}
{"text":"Had granny's country omlet.  Good food,  polite service and a good place to eat breakfast overall."}
{"text":"My picture was taken here. Four stars just for the mini-chimis and the patty melt."}
{"text":"I dident like the country Benedict it had a white sauce and a sausage that was gross but I switched my meal to regular bacon and eggs and it was better! Great service by waiter"}
{"text":"From outside, Perkins at night looks like a shining oasis of enchantment. Cozy atmosphere the second you walk in. Seasonal decorations, kitch sculptures, and lovely waitresses add to the comfort. I enjoyed my slice of chocolate caramel silk pie in the quiet late night atmosphere while a sitting lawn deer statue looked dolefully on. Pie filling was delightful and decadent but too sweet to finish."}
{"text":"I stopped in while waiting to pick someone up from the airport. Boy do I wish I would of went somewhere else! The food had me feeling gross the rest of the day! Not good when your wedding is literally 3 days away.  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Chipotle, was a HUGE disappointment! First off, the description read \"Blackened chicken.\" I can assure you that is not what was on my plate, my bun was rock solid to the point where I hit it with my fork, no dent was made! I didn't even have the mentioned ranch dressing. As for an attempt to look for the waiter, he was nowhere to be found.   Just an awful experience all together. Never again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast !! Pancake is amazing ! The food come so fast !! Will come back for sure next time in town !"}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant a 1 star based on the manager at the front desk.  We walked in with a big party of approx 15 and the Manager refused to let me walk in because I was holding a medium Tim Hortons Cup.  He centered me out in front of everyone and told me to leave until I threw out the cup.  If everyone had not already parked and ready to be seated we would have left.  I know everyone did not order as much as they normally would have based on this horrible display of customer service. Not sure how Perkins honestly believes they can compete with Tim Hortons coffee and I will never get why walking in a cup is all of the sudden going to deter anyone from drinking their crappy coffee!   Poor business practices, and customer service!  It's obvious we were not there for the just coffee and they just lost 15 customers based on this experience."}
{"text":"I stopped by with some teammates, a while back, after a hockey game.  I got a honey mustard chicken sandwhich thing and horrible food poisoning.  If it weren't for the horrible gastrointestinal distress it would have been about 3 stars."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was hot and ready. Well go again if I'm ever in the area. ."}
{"text":"Our server Kelly was absolutely awesome the food came out good and hot and if you ever want to go I would really suggest this location"}
{"text":"Since I stayed at the Hampton Inn, I decided to grab a quick lunch next door at Perkins. Boy, was this a mistake. Let me explain:  1. This place does not offer vegetarian-friendly lunch options. I ended up getting the tomato basil soup and the wedge salad without the bacon. Both were subpar. 2. The service staff showed little effort. After my waitress carelessly placed the water on my table, she just threw my straw in front of me and hurriedly proceeded to serve the neighboring table. Wow. What's more is that my wedge salad was hastily assembled--the iceberg lettuce was stacked in chunks and the bleu cheese was piled on one side.  3. The booth I sat at was not well-cleaned, and the table was sticky. How the heck this happened is beyond me.  The only thing holding me back from giving them 1 star is that their pastries at the front counter look well made. Sorry, Perkins. You're never seeing me again."}
{"text":"First time here at midnight, ordered some fried chicken strips. Next day I have a severe stomach-ache. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I was concerned when I read some of the other reviews, but this Perkins met all my expectations. The menu is the same one I saw in other Perkins restaurants in Wisconsin. I wish I could remember our server's name so I could give her some recognition. She was both friendly and very professional.  I could tell that this Perkins is not in the best spot to attract customers when we drove there, and it did seem that they carried a skeleton crew. The servers not only waited tables, they also bused them. As I said we were delighted with the service we received. All four of us in my party ordered something different and the food came out quickly, exactly as we ordered, and was served to the right person without the usual \"Who ordered what?\" that some servers rely on. The food was hot and well prepared.  We found it amusing that they had two male managers standing around doing nothing while the two waitresses worked their butts off. It is to our waitress's credit that her attitude was so good. And no, I don't know anyone who works there and not do I live in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my daughter. Hadn't been to a Perkins in years. Was really good. Granddaughter was there. The staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"My expectations were not too high going in and overall it was about what I expected. Service was mediocre at best as I had to wait about five minutes just to be acknowleged by someone to get a table.  When I was seated, it was at a dirty table which had to be cleaned. Chair I sat in was sticky, eww. The restaurant was busy (100pm on Saturday), but it still was a bit dirtier and more unorganized than most. Waitress was pleasent enough but did not offer or refill my drink until right when I was about to leave. Actually, the best part was the meal itself. I had grilled chicken over rice with asparagus. The grilled chicken was moist and flavorful, while the aspargus was cooked just right and delicious. The price was also ok. The meal was definitely close to a 3.5/4 while most everything else was a 2 or a 1. Overall, a 2.5 and would try again, just not anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Boys and i went here, and we had really good food, and the service was good, with the exception of the side dishes they totally forget to bring. Its a good place, but its a little slow too."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed an omelette.Highlights were server and  customer service. Kudos to Otto!.."}
{"text":"Here again for the second day in a row. I don't care what everyone else says. This place is 5 stars solid for the value and service you get!"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out after your evening shift, or bar closings.  Don't bother too much with anything other than breakfast, which is not the greatest, but consistent and filling.  In other words, fill the void and don't expect parsley or anchovies on your ceasar salad."}
{"text":"Gotta love breakfast places.. they make the world go around.  Went in for a typical Canadian breakfast and was pleased to get exactly what I had ordered. Not that greasy from what I can remember as well.    Very clean presentation and fresh ingredients used.    Great place for large groups and families alike.   Service was prompt pricing is average."}
{"text":"I came in tonight to grab some take-out.  I stood at the empty hostess stand and waited...waited....waited....waited.  Finally I see a waitress coming up aaaannnd....she studied the carpet pattern with such attention that she walked by me without a word.  There were about five people scattered around the restaurant eating.  I walked out and bought tomorrow's breakfast at Walgreens, yuuuummmy!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain restaurant. Food is consistent. I tend to be able to get here early in the morning when the restaurant is usually empty. At that time, the service is outstanding. Waitress on duty is very friendly."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly establishment. Our host and server were both very friendly and attentive. Food was average but we liked that you get a free slice of pie every Monday with your meal!"}
{"text":"Standard family diner. Nothing surprising here. A decent place to stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience, table was dirty with cream and sugar wrappers on it ... the waitress did not notice.   Did not find the portions big at all for the price"}
{"text":"OK this place is good old American style comfort food! When you want/need to max the carbs out to get your endorphins spinning out of control this is the place to go. Reminds me of an upper scale Dennys - similar food choices but they taste better and overall more comfortable setting. Have been going here since the 80's with family and friends. Being open 24 hours I have visited many times after midnight back in the 90's - fun memories with friends!"}
{"text":"I should have known that seeing only one other table occupied at 7am was not a good sign; it wasn't. The coffee was pretty good and the service was decent if not overwhelming. But the breakfast - especially in the context of VALUE - left a lot to be desired. Had it not been for the fact that this place was within easy walking distance of my hotel (drizzling outside), I would have looked elsewhere.  Eleven dollars got me a French toast breakfast. The French toast was OK but that's about it. The fake maple syrup was a turn-off. The eggs were decent, but not great. But the two WIMPY strips of bacon really had me shaking my head. Four bites and gone. There is a Southern-style \"Old Country Store\" not far away that serves decent bacon and real maple syrup. Had it not been for the greater-than-one-mile walk, I would have gone there.  The piped-in gawdawful 70's & 80's music further added to my irritation.  Were it not for the good coffee and decent service, this place would've gotten ONE star."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast. Good service - I didn't wait at all to be seated or to receive my food.  I really like the food came exactly as I ordered it."}
{"text":"A taste for everyone!  Super friendly staff with a menu for all.  They offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner at all times and have a mouth-watering dessert menu!  Portion size is more than expected and the staff are accommodating to any requests.  Great prices and their meals and the service is well worth a higher tip!  I've visited this location a handful of times and have received the same excelled services each time."}
{"text":"I can't stress how disappointing my visit was to this location. In the past I lived in Buffalo and visited the Perkins in Williamsville many times and always got solid food.   Today the server messed up our order so many times that we actually started laughing at each additional error. Each noted error had to be repeated until it was right: the wrong salad was brought out and the next one had the wrong dressing. The server caught that a side was missing then forgot to get it. She kept apologizing and we kept smiling.   A comedy of errors culminating in a meh and cold club sandwich. A lot of factors can lead to distracted workers so we didn't take it personally. However too many errors to go back given the available choices in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely would not come back here. The food is mediocre at best and definitely not worth the price.   We mulled over the menu for quite a while and finally opted for French toast and a magnificent seven. The pancakes that came with the magnificent seven were tasteless and dry. My first instinct was to add more maple syrup but it wasn't much better. It almost tasted as though it had been watered down. To top it all off, the eggs were undercooked.   The ONLY reason why this is getting more than a 1-star is because the waitresses where really pleasant, quick and efficient.   It's so disappointing to go out for a meal only to end up paying for something I could have made better myself."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  One would think that any restaurant in America's Dairyland, especially a chain restaurant that has been around for decades, could serve breakfast without screwing it up.  Our family of three ordered breakfast for dinner tonight and this Perkins disappointed the heck out of us.  One order was steak and eggs: the steak was supposed to be medium and the eggs over hard. What came to the table was a bloody, raw steak -- not rare, mind you, but raw -- and eggs with a translucent, inedible crust around the outer edge.  Some of that crust ended up in one of the other orders, which was scrambled eggs with biscuits and gravy. One does not expect the possibility of breaking a tooth when eating scrambled eggs, but not one, not two, but three two-inch long pieces of that translucent crust ended up in the folded, dry \"scrambled eggs.\"  Another order of scrambled eggs -- mine -- had a long, thin, hair-like thread of indeterminate origin. Was it the same substance as the translucent crust? Was it a string from a hairnet? Was it a human hair? When I pulled it from my mouth, it split in two and curled up like elastic might curl up.  Our server was appropriately apologetic and tried to make things okay -- the service was good, but the food was absolutely horrid!  The manager asked us how our dinner was when we went to pay, so we told her. She took 20% off of our bill but, truly, the food we ate was overpriced at any discount. If we all hadn't been so darn hungry and tired, we'd have left without eating. And if I had it to do over, I would have insisted we all leave after finding the inedible translucent hard gluey stuff in the eggs and find somewhere else to go.  Do NOT repeat our mistake. AVOID this restaurant. Try the IHOP down the road if you want breakfast. Go across the interstate to Texas Roadhouse if you want a steak. Go hungry if you must, just don't eat here. Please."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday because the other breakfast options had long waits.  We were seated immediately here, which was nice, because we had a time frame to work in.  Server was friendly, and the food was surprisingly decent.  Comparable to Bob Evans in terms of quality, but maybe a smidge better service."}
{"text":"My wife went here with her church group and liked it, so she suggested I go with her sometime. We went on a Wednesday and I have to say I was impressed. Waitress was nice and attentive, yet not too. Wednesday we found out was senior's night with a discount. We both had the Chicken Tenders, and it was wonderful. I had buttered corn along with a side salad, my wife had Mashed potatoes and broccoli. She loved it all. Neither of us are big eaters so there was enough left to take home for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Went with a healthy option, spinach & mushroom scramble. One of the better healthy options I have had anywhere. Service and atmosphere were great. Had a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Food was great and came out quick. The smasher was very cheesy. Service was friendly and pretty good coffee also."}
{"text":"Food was really bad. Fried pickle badder was salty make the dish overly salty because pickles are already salty, the bajou shrimp smasher was bad. They didn't scramble the eggs very well. It looked and tasted like they put eggs in a skillet and then when it was done cut it up and called it scramble. The shrimp was over cooked and the onions and bell pepper wasn't sauteed for enough time,so it was really crunchy. With all that being said the staff was more then willing to refund my money and apologized for the bad experience."}
{"text":"I can't comment on food as the service was so bad I had to walk out with the family. It went a little like this. On a weekday morning the family decides to have breakfast at Perkins. We came as a party of 6 but sat in a booth for 4. As we sat there discussing amongst ourselves on seat location the server comes out puts in the middle of the table 4 napkins and counts out 6 forks, 6 knives, and 6 spoons. At this time you may think whats the matter with that. As I look around the restaurant everybody else had individually wrapped silverware while ours was counted out in big mess in the middle of the table. I took the silverware problem as a grain of salt and waited to place our drink orders.   After a 20min of waiting to place a drink order we already knew what we wanted to eat.  Server finally comes over and asks us what we like to drink. Everybody went around the table and place their respective drink orders. After the last person put in their order, I informed her we are ready to order. Server informs me that she will come back with our drinks then take our orders, which seem like no problem. That was until it took 10 min just for our drinks to come out. After drinks were passed out I attempted to order and was again placed on hold. Server needed to get another tables order that was ready. By this time my patients was very thin. We've been there for over 40 min and was only served drinks and have not placed an order.  After the server served her table of food, another table across from her asked for refills. When she left to fill there cups, we decided to leave. If taking an order was this bad, how long would it take for the food to come out? So we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Everything tasted terrible like it was all cooked in the same grease from yesterday. Waitresses were on point but that's the only good thing. We left( a family of 6) with only like 8 bites taken a piece. Never again will I subject myself to something so gross again."}
{"text":"I just got an email saying this location is closed.  Is it? I like Perkins and the variety in the menu.  My son, grandson, and I like different things so that works for us.  Likewise for the bakery case, lots of variety."}
{"text":"OK, best service ever! At 10 pm on a Sunday with nothing else to eat besides Taco Bell, it was nice to sit down and be taken care of.  Cheap and easy, just how I like it.  It's Perkins...you get what you pay for, but we had great service in Ohio, so there!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, other than that, they really need to CLEAN. It smells like mildew/musty, in the whole place. floors/old carpet are visibly dirty. The bathrooms are dirty as well, no TP. Portions are small and not well cooked, definitely not worth the price - for breakfast anyway.  Too bad, it used to be a good place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Just like the Perkins in the states with excellent service to match! Yummy all-day breakfast, hot and fresh coffee, and service with a smile. I was treated to a meal here with my daughter, and we will both be returning. (We didn't get a chance to try any desserts yet!) Great job so far!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Perkins for a long time, but decided to stop in for breakfast.  The menu offers a number of items.  Service was attentive.  I ordered an omelet and unfortunately was disappointed.  When I order an omelet, I am used to having ingredients mixed in with the omelet and having it look and taste fresh.  What i received looked like an egg patty wrapped around ingredients.  The cheese was not even melted but a square piece was laid on top of the rolled omelet. I have seen frozen omelets that were more inspired."}
{"text":"They accommodated our party of 11 quite quickly which was pretty impressive seeing as there were a lot of other parties waiting for tables. Their menu is similar to a Denny's or an IHOP. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have corned beef hash (my go to food item at breakfast places) but there were lots of other menu items that caught my eye. I ended up getting their classic eggs breakfast which came with two eggs, hash browns, a fresh in house baked muffin, and bacon. Everything was great except one of my poached eggs turned out to be hard boiled.  P.S. if you like your hash brows crispy you should ask for them that way. Theirs are on the softer side."}
{"text":"The Perkins here has never been known for being staffed with happy people.  I found that they continue the tradition with my recent visit for lunch. Now I was looking forward to seeing the new place as they really needed a refresher and a clean up.   The new place helps but I'm not so sure I like the layout.  It is small and boxy.  I liked the old layout better.   But the place is brighter which is nice. The food was pretty good so no fault there.  But the service was subpar.   I felt like they could care less if I ate there or not.   We joked around a little with our waitress and she barely cracked a smile.   The manager came by and asked us if everything was ok and when we said it was she stated that she was glad to hear that in a sort of canned way while she was walking away.  Once again giving us the impression that she could care less. Now we saw our waitress at another point away from our table and think that she was stressed out over something.  So whatever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customers.  We still gave her a good tip because she looked like she needed it. Bottom line is I won't be going back here for some time until the management and staff change over which I suspect it will in about 6 months.  See you then. 2017 Hard to believe it has been 4 years since I have eaten here!  See what happens when someone has a bad experience? I returned to meet up with three friends.  This time went quite well.   The food good as reported by my friends and I have to say that my Cobb Salad was excellent.  If you like salad they do this salad up nice and it is a very good size.  No skimping here. The staff was better in that they were pleasant but no one was there to greet us when we arrived and we had to wait a while.   The place was not busy, only about three other tables had people at them.   The bakery section has been reduced quite a bit so it doesn't seem like Perkins is the bakery place it once was.  I got two brownies to go and they were very good. So they go up a notch but need to improve on their cheerfulness.  Overall very good service at our table."}
{"text":"A bizarre experience. Our waitress was irritated to have to wait on us from the moment we sat down. We visited at a semi-busy time but they weren't slammed so no excuse for the saltiness from the waitress. She forgot items and cut me off mid sentence multiple times. Another waitress picked up her slack somewhere in the middle of our meal and was attentive and seemed happy to be doing her job.   The food was ok. I wouldn't recommend anything that isn't deep fried though. I was really disappointed with this location as I had great experiences at other Perkins in the past. I would not go back to this location and would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Belgian waffle with strawberries at 1230am.  It was me and two groups of 4 people. Service seemed a bit slow for the small crowd of customers. Food was ok. The manager was a bit pushy. I enjoyed free WiFi."}
{"text":"No stars** This place is gross, dark and I'd never eat there. I went inside once, last year. I didn't even want to sit but I figured I would give it a shot. The place just looked dark and gloomy so when we got to the table it was sticky and there is a odor in the place. No way I could eat food there. I can't wait for the good Perkins in Brooklyn to reopen!"}
{"text":"I went here recently, and I had a spinach and cheese omelet.  A strange thing happened in the kitchen though, something kind of like the fog that turns you inside out, I suspect.  When my omelet came out it was actually a spinach omelet with a bit of egg and cheese tucked inside.  Wow, that is so crazy........oh and gross.  I am not Popeye, nor am I a rabbit, therefore playing a game of find the egg and cheese in a spinach haystack is not awesome dudes.  FAIL."}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to Perkins just this year and every time we've driven through  Wisconsin, we've stopped at a Perkins. This was the 3rd Perkins that I've been to and have enjoyed the food and service every time.  We both ordered pancakes with a side of bacon. The food was very good and the service was even better.  My wife commented that either Perkins manages to hire the friendliest people or they have excellent training."}
{"text":"One of the best chain breakfast restaurants in Calgary.   Pricing is awesome, huge huge menu and service is always excellent.   Portions and taste of food is very good.   Interior dining area and seats feels dated but it is a breakfast place!  Overall great restaurant to go for anytime breakfast. Great value."}
{"text":"This is quietly the worst food I have ever been served.  My family of four visited this place and neither one of us could eat our food.  Between the four of us, we had the steak medallion, the maple glazed pork chops, the granny omelet and the big country skillet.  None of us could eat more than three bites of our food.  The food here is simply not seasoned.   None of the food had a taste.  They took a piece of meat and cooked it without any tips of seasoning, not even salt and pepper.  We couldn't even eat the pancakes because they had no taste either.  The best thing here was the coke soft drinks.  Do yourself a favor and find another place to eat!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby.  Easily one of the cleanest Perkins I've ever seen.  I was told this location was recently renovated.  You have to register you license plate at the front counter, as they share the parking lot with a Holiday Inn and it is very close to the airport.  We got a nice booth fairly close to the window.    Anyhow, the service was very good.  The server was quite efficient and we never felt rushed at any point.  I had the \"Farmer's Omelette\" with breakfast potatoes & 3 buttermilk pancakes.  The pancakes were light and fluffy....not the best I've ever had but much better than Denny's or The Golden Griddle.  The omelette was also very good.  They have an interesting way of folding the omelettes.  I didn't have room for the breakfast potatoes....so I took them home with me and made a (mostly) homemade scrambler the next day.   In our group of 4 everyone ordered breakfast items and were happy with both their meals and the service.  Nice job."}
{"text":"Service was fine, restaurant was clean. Pancakes had zero flavor. Sausage links were WHITE inside. Like globs of fat with no meat."}
{"text":"Michael greeted us warmly at the door. He was also our waiter, his service was prompt and very friendly. The food was served quickly and very good!"}
{"text":"I loved the chicken with mushroom and asparagus.My boyfriend loved the turkey meatloaf.We had Apple pie and it was very good.Would definitely comeback."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean with big parking spot. My only complaint here is the tables. It's very tight especially if there's more than two people. Otherwise food is awesome and service was swift."}
{"text":"I only come for breakfast..and that occurs before 6 am. The place has a large number of older men who frequent the place and the wait staff are super good at their jobs. The management is a little creepy. Food is standard fare."}
{"text":"Friends said too try this for breakfast and I'm glad I did! 730 on a Monday morning it was pretty empty, so we were confident we would get great service. We did. Food was good portions were big and waitress was great. More expensive than Denny's but worth it."}
{"text":"I used to visit Florida frequently and Perkins was one of our go-to places in the neighbourhood where I usually stayed. Seeing one open up in Pickering close to home brought back some memories, good memories, although not of their food. It was good for its time.  I remember Perkins being good for breakfast and brunch so I came here with breakfast in mind and ended up with a popular brunch item - Steak Medallions and Eggs, served with hash browns and a side of three buttermilk pancakes. Coffee was extra.  Nobody should ever complain about portions at this place. It was a lot of food! I had ordered my steak cooked to medium and it was very tender but was much closer to medium rare. Not a big deal for me. The eggs were cooked fine but the hash browns could have used a little more colour. Not a bad dish though.  The pancakes were served on a separate plate, topped with a pat of butter and accompanied by three different syrups in a caddy. This alone would have been enough breakfast for several people that I know.  Servicewise, it was nice to see the manager checking up on tables throughout the dining room. My server, however, was trying just a little too hard. There's often a fine line between good and annoying service. This was much closer to the latter. She kept telling me her name and suggested several times that I give her a good rating for her service (for their online survey and otherwise). Sorry, this was a fail.  Overall, the food was good and I'll be back. I've seen several restaurants fail in this location so I hope they do well. I wish they opened later."}
{"text":"It's not fine dining, but I've always enjoyed eating at a Perkins. They serve decent affordable comfort food. I've always received good friendly service and here was no different. The restaurant was just across the street from my hotel so it was pretty convenient for me. The entrance was sort of in the back.  For this particular visit, I ordered the turkey dinner with mashed potatoes and corn. It was good as if it was an early Thanksgiving dinner. I had an ice tea with my meal and my server made sure to keep my glass full the entire time."}
{"text":"Perkins is not our typical stop... however my boyfriend has been begging me for months for Perkins potato pancakes and tonight I gave in... I'm so happy I did. Our server Judy was hands down the best server we have ever had! She has been with the company since I believe she said 1987 which would explain the incredible service!  Thanks Judy!"}
{"text":"Ugh is about all you can say about this Perkins location. Poor service that results in incorrect orders.  Food that's tasteless or under/overdone. Find a better option."}
{"text":"This has been a go-to spot for brunch for my family for years and years. It was also a great spot for us as teenagers when we wanted a late meal after hanging out. But this review is based on more recent visits. :-)  It can get busy on Sundays after churches typically get out. But, for the most part, there is not a long wait. One one recent occasion I had brunch with my mom and a family friend. I ordered a salad. It was HUGE. I actually had to take half of it to go! On the second recent trip, we went out as a family for Mother's Day. No wait late in the afternoon. I ordered the banana blueberry pancakes. They were supposed to be multigrain, but learned that they had discontinued the multigrain batter the week before. :-(  But the waitress said that they could make them with regular batter. I was surprosed that the bananas were not baked in the pancake, rather they were sliced on top. Regardless, the pancakes were still good. They have sugar free syrup if that is your preference and it wasn't bad. They let me alter my order no problem. It was supposed to come with turkey sausage and egg whites. But I changed it to fruit and bacon. No extra charge.  Speed of service and attentiveness dependent upon who you get and the time of day. But I haven't had a negative experience. Pay your tab at the front register, not at the table."}
{"text":"I don't usually have much good to say about chain restaurants in CU. But I feel some positive feedback is warranted in this case. Perkins has really upped there game over the past year or so. Though I occasionally have lunch or a late evening snack here, the majority of my experience is during breakfast hours. The food is slightly better than average, better than most chains. But the service, once sorely lacking has improved greatly. Management and staff have improved in attitude, efficiency and speed of service. There are a limited number of good breakfast places in this town and sometimes waits can be long. I believe Perkins provides a worthwhile alternative."}
{"text":"I finally made my first visit to a Perkins and I was very pleasantly surprised.   While I normally like to opt for local restaurants. Perkins is the opposite, being a well established diner chain, like unto IHOP or Denny's.   I would say the biggest departures from Perkin's counterparts were, tables that were not sticky, good service, and the ability to make substitutions without upcharges.  This place is a solid, perfectly adequate, 3 star joint. I would totally come back."}
{"text":"They just don't know how to talk to these people, service is absolutely horrible. Food is not great, but also expensive. They're rude and avoid the cashier, not sure what's up with him."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers with mashed potato, and corn was awesome.  It was clean inside, friendly waitress, stayed at hampton inn next door.   They give you 10% off for saying there."}
{"text":"Out of all the chain breakfast places, I probably will always pick Perkins. Mostly because they have a large variety of choices and their pies.   If you join their Perkins Club, you get a free breakfast meal for your birthday. You always get to know what the Wednesday special is. Secret's Put: buy one get one entree.   Good for families and kid friendly. They also offer Late Night Bites. Every night after 9pm, you can get all you can eat pancakes for $5.99, burger, fries and coke combo for $8.99, and 1/2 price appetizers (not a lot of options in this category) and 1/2 off slices of pie.   I typically stick to their breakfast options. I love their breakfast potatoes. Eggs are always cooked to order. Their pancakes are great. Coffee is decent. Pies are good. I've had their chicken pot pie but it was very salty. However the crust was great.   The manager on duty always walks by tables and also helps out when it gets busier. This is one of the reasons I like coming here when I don't want to cook at home."}
{"text":"Here's a tip:  If you plan on using a coupon at this place, get ready to be treated like garbage. Sat down for breakfast with my mom this morning and she pulled out a coupon book she had bought from a school drive and had nothing but opposition trying to use them from our giddy, passive aggressive server. After that, we were treated to shady glances from the manager and server for the rest of our visit and the most plastic artificial service I have ever had from a server.   Food was good, prices are good, but service was really unprofessional and when I spoke to the manager after our meal he pretended nothing had happened and really did nothing at all to make either of us feel any better.   My parents love eating here, but I am never going back. Plenty of great choices for food of this quality elsewhere without the questionable people skills."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had worse service. My girlfriend, roommate and I walked right in and were sat immediately. After sitting for almost 10+ minutes the manager came over to inform us that drinks were on the house and asked if we'd like some. 10+ minutes later our three coffees and one coke arrived minus the coke we ordered. 15+ minutes later food and aforementioned coke was delivered. Waitress (Latasha) forgot to ask what flavor muffin my girlfriend wanted and then did, delivered the muffin and latasha told us it was a,\"fake muffin\" because they didn't bake it properly. When all was said and done I think I can honestly say I'll never go to Perkins again. Ever."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice. Everything seemed clean but the floor(carpet was littered.) It seemed as if it were shift change time or something because the employees were asking one another if they wanted a table and so on. After it was decided who would take our table we showed the waitress our comp tickets from the previous Perkins experience(see my review on the Brooklyn location) and she promptly took them to the manager for approval. After approval and some ten minutes we ordered 2 waters and 2 coffees. Got 2 coffees and one water then we ordered food. 20 mins and food was ready. While they were readying our food we watched the waitress reach in the bakery case and bare hand my girlfriends muffin from the top. Food came and we tore the muffin open and low and behold a hair was in it(see picture.) I didn't say a word of this to anyone there because this was our second try and... What's the point? The manager who comped our meals also had a shirt on that was completely filthy. Perkins, we tried again. From the cash register you could see into the \"expo\" area... Also filthy. The pies in the bakery case were propped up by portion cups. I'm sorry but I'm not sold. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Perkins since I was a kid (popcorn chicken and Where's Waldo? activity books FTW) and while my last visit was not so great, they're generally a reliable location. Most days the food is tasty if unimaginative, they can accommodate groups, and they usually can get you in and out pretty quick despite the lobby being packed to the gills on weekend mornings.   For the last few years I've avoided Perkins on the whole because of sub-par food and service from another location (an annual stop after a camping music festival due to their being open on holidays and ability to seat 10-12 of us with no reservation), but my man friend really likes their breakfast and, more specifically, not having to wait for breakfast like you do at most places downtown. Over the summer I had an avocado/queso/english muffin creation that actually really surprised me with how good it was and breakfast potatoes that were clearly deep fried but similarly surprising in how much I enjoyed them. The breakfast combo price was right ($8ish dollars), and for some reason one of the available sides was a muffin, so I came away with breakfast the next day, too.   Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when we stopped back in. Sadly, my breakfast find had disappeared from the menu and they appear to have done away with the bonkers muffin side. Nothing was really striking my fancy on the most recent menu, so I decided to pick one of the most ridiculous offerings, an apple cinnamon muffin that was sliced into thirds and turned into french toast. I'm sure it was terrible for me, and while the flavor was surprisingly good, muffins just aren't stable enough to hold up to being battered and so it was kind of mushy mess. Compounding my meh meal was the fact that it took close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive, tracking down our server was difficult, and my appetite was put off by how dirty the ledge under our booth was. We were seated in one of their tiny (but cool) two-person booths along the window and with the morning sun pouring in I could see all the crumbs, bits of paper, and rusty bobby pins on the window sill. If anyone from Perkins happens to read this, please, please clean that up. The fact that the pins were rusty tells me it's been awhile since a vacuum has made its way to that area. Yuck.   While my most recent visit was definitely a two-star experience, they've been just fine on other visits so I'll leave my overall rating at a three. Not the best choice in Madison, but a reliable stand-by on the whole."}
{"text":"When you need a late night weeknight dinner, you can count on Perkins to be open. The BF and I went to a later moving screening without having had dinner so we were both hungry after 10. He has a lifelong love of Perkins, so off we went.   There were a surprising amount of people filling the dining room for a late weeknight, but that worked in our favor as they were appropriately staffed and service was fairly quick. While they have late night specials like half-priced slices of pie and AYCE pancakes, I went with the sandwich I had always ordered in high school: the chicken tenders melt.   I don't even want to think about how bad it is for you, but in the moment it hit the spot/scratched that nostalgic itch. At least until I got to a tender that was half connective tissue, anyway. This is par for the course at many chains; no one takes the time to clean the chicken properly, be it in house or at the factory where it's mass-produced. I don't know which is the culprit at Perkins, but I learned years ago to proceed with caution.   I'm probably never going to suggest Perkins as our destination, but since my gent enjoys it I'm sure we'll be back here and there."}
{"text":"I was acknowledged upon entering the restaurant.  The food was amazing!  I had chicken breast with spinach and grilled asparagus.  Randi was my server.  She was very personable, friendly, professional and very prompt.  The manager was on the floor checking with customers on the food and service which was nice.  Mondays, you get free pie included with your meal.  The French silk was delicious.  I will definitely visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came here after a cold night after my friends made me go skating with them which was an absolute fail. Then, Everyone was craving breakfast at 9:30pm.   So my friend recommended this place, he said it was kinda like Denny's but not really. So we came here and everyone ordered the breakfast with eggs, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns with a side order of pancakes. I was tempted But ended up getting the burger meal instead with fries, just to be different. It was alright, the breakfast tasted better! Especially those pancakes with whipped butter, Damn I felt like i was 8 years old on a Saturday morning while watching cartoons!    The service was alright, the people are nice but not too nice. Nice cute Denny's look alike place."}
{"text":"pathetic place  but is to be expected at a chain restaurant in the middle of the night.  there was a dead bug in my water.  the workers there are a bunch of high school dropouts.  I even overheard one waiter say the chef is a pothead.  at the end I requested a sugar cookie with the frosting on top.  I get back to my hotel room and discover it had no frosting.  on top of it all, they refused to give me some compensation for all the trouble.  they charged me for an extra bread roll.  the interior of the place looks nice, it's sad that it's being overrun by a bunch of employees that look like they just got out of jail."}
{"text":"Service good, people extremely nice, , food is ok.  The menu options are extremely limited; about 1/3 of the choices you would have at Denny's or IHOP.  The portions are generous, and are served in a timely fashion.  If you are on a diet and want to lose weight, go to their restrooms before you order.  Your appetite is guaranteed to disappear; the stink is painfully evident even in the hall outside the restrooms, and is absolutely disgusting.   Probably won't return.  Hope they expand their menu, and clean the restrooms."}
{"text":"On the road back from Chicago we pulled off the highway for a place to eat.  Not a lot of options so we ventured into Perkins.  Basic food - not very exciting especially after the places we dined in while in Chicago.  Well it looks like vacation is over."}
{"text":"Says they are open 24hrs on their website, but I went there at 11:54 pm and the two waitresses smoking outside told me they were closed. Guess not."}
{"text":"Good tasting inexpensive food. Friendly staff. I had the steak and pepper dish and finished with a slice of cherry pie. Wife had the turkey,BLT club. Both meals were very tasty and I think you get your moneys worth. We also got the buy 3 get 6 muffins for next mornings breakfast."}
{"text":"Alright so I've only ever been here when I've been hungover. But let me tell you, the shitty $1.99 bottomless coffee, hash browns, and omelet stuffed with all sorts of processed cheese and meat...IS THE BEST HANGOVER CURE EVER.    The place is like Denny's.  Big whoop.  Everyone there seems a little depressed....customers, staff, everyone.  But hey, with that type of environment going in your sweatpants and with a hangover...you fit right in."}
{"text":"Getting my free magnificent seven breakfast for free ,I've been coming here on and off since the mid eighties and it's never changed except for getting super expensive like $9.99 for sausage and biscuits."}
{"text":"Love the menu. Staffing is poor. Wife and I went in at 10:00am for breakfast. Lobby had 12 people (6 were checking out,1 person being cashier/hostess.) That left 6 to be seated. The manager told to hostess to \"block doors\". I asked and they told the patrons waiting it would be a 20 min. wait. Keep in mind that had about 10-15 EMPTY TABLES. This place NEVER HAS ENOUGH STAFF. Food good STAFFING HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Whenever it's late, or you just hungry for basic food - this is the place for you.  Nothing sophisticated. Nothing special.  Just basic food with very reasonable price"}
{"text":"I just love Perkins. Sorry guys - it reminds me of home. In MN we have a target and a perkins on every corner, here it's walgreens and george webbs. I miss home.   Before heading to Camp Randall for the game I stopped in at Perkins for some breakfast. I was seated right away and Diane came over to grab a drink order. She was attentive and helpful, our food came out quickly, and checkout was smooth. I would come back, if for nothing else, the chicken noodle soup (:"}
{"text":"Just left awesome service..the steak medallions w hollandaise sauce were tender and juicy and just fabulous..the fresh fruit was cold and juicy the muffin was soft moist and just wonderful.Best breakfast on town..Manager Corin.was sweet smiling and a great way to start our day ...Five star meal. WOW."}
{"text":"If you crave 3000 calories of breakfast food for less than $10 late at night after a couple of hours of skiing (or anything else), your only options on the west side are Denny's, IHOP, and Perkins.  I guess I'm discounting McDonalds, but I don't count that as real food even though these other three skirt the line at times (I doubt there is anything approximating \"real\" in their pancake syrup).  Of the three, Perkins is probably the best, but the others get the job done as well.    Warning-- Friday night is all you can eat fish fry until 9.  At 11 pm it was still clear from the tater tots that they had cooked a lot of fish that night, and hadn't changed the oil.  Lucky for me, they were my kid's tater tots..."}
{"text":"After ihop shut down on campus, Perkins is an alternative for brunch. I ve never been here for lunch and dinner so far."}
{"text":"The service here is unbelievably bad. Waited 10 minutes just to be seated and now we have waited for almost an hour for our food. There is literally one waitress and no hostess.  Turns out there's also no cook. He cut his finger so the hostess/manager who isn't a cook is cooking. The good news is our meal was comped because when it did come it was vile. How can you screw up grilled cheese and pancakes.  Never again. Free or not."}
{"text":"Watch closely when you Pay.  They swipe our card (they don't have the chip equipment yet) 3 times.  I check my Bank and sure enough, I was double billed.   It is a real hassle to get the money put back into my account.  And I have to show them my Bank statement,  which is on my phone.  I don't like it.  But to get $30.00 to $45.00 back I have no other choice.    Oh and one more thing,  Snarky with a capital S.  Never hardly a Manager on duty.  And WHY is it so hard to say you're welcome instead of No Problem when I say Thank you?   A real peeve of mine.   I'll be nice and give one star.  This is the Perkins in Urbana,  IL."}
{"text":"I stopped in looking to grab an early 5:30 AM breakfast. I walked in and noticed one male and one female employee joking around with each other. Wouldn't matter at all if it weren't for the following... My first stop was the men's restroom. I didn't need to use the restroom, but I did need to blow my nose. I opened the sole stall door. There was blood splattered on the floor and against the lower wall a bit. You're probably as perplexed as I was. The toilet was extremely disgusting.  Definitely needed flushed, but also cleaned. One of the worst restrooms I've seen in a long time. No way was I going to eat any food from that place. I turned around and walked out without even blowing my nose. I went across the street to Dunkin' Donuts. So while I can't rate the food, the place really didn't give me a chance to."}
{"text":"I'm good with the Perkins. My daughter is a fan of chocolate chip pancakes, and that's what she wanted and got. My eggs benedict was reasonably chain-store decent, and my other daughter enjoyed her meal also.  We got seated pretty quickly on a Sunday morning, and we left satisfied for the cost."}
{"text":"We were greeted when we came in and seated right away. Took waitress 10 minutes to come see us and they were not very busy.  We ordered our food which came pretty quick. I tried the new shrimp and pasta thing they have it was priced at $11.00 it was the smallest thing j have ever seen a Jenny Craig meal was bigger than this have in mind also there was no additional lauded or a salad that came with it so I left starving. Wife had the chicken fried steak huge plate with mashed potatoes and beans or tots for way less than fine what a rip off for me. The the waitress was like never there I ate my whole meal and never saw her once to get a drink refill. I would never go back there you get better service at Denny's"}
{"text":"I've come here on 3 occassions. All of them were because I was hungry and nothing else was open. Did what I had to do to survive.   The food isn't necessarily bad but it's not good either. It's very much ... it's hard to describe. Let me back up.  I've dined here during the late night hours around midnight. You would think it would be slow considering the time but that is far from the case. Again, due to other sit down places being  closed at midnight, Perkin generates business for this reason alone. They serve typical diner food, breakfast, finger food, burgers, soups, etc. There are usually 2 servers working the entire diner. Services while good is very slow because waiters are working hard to be at more than one place at one time which is impossible. I give them credit for being as good as they are for that. Also, kudos to them for being professional. I've seen some extremely rude diners and they kept their composure.   Food again isn't bad but it's your typical late night diner food. It serves it purpose for filling you up but it's nothing that is the finest quality. They are better known for their bakery. Once, I had a muffin and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Their pies and other pastries really do look appetizing I must admit and to be diner made, they are good.   Overall, Perkins serves it purpose. To be a diner that stays open 24 hours and feeds people decent food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat after church and for breakfast is amazing. There are so many choices like omelets, pancakes, breakfast burrito, and more. There's this one waiter that is so funny. The bakery is good because you could just walk to the cashier and pick what you want and the pies are delicious."}
{"text":"very  over priced  got pancakes bacon  drink  and  my  friend  got  small  breckfest  price  was  30.00 before  tip  35.00 after"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food, stale and terrible service. Waited for over half an hour to just get coffee.  So called Manager on duty was a really winner! Obviously has never had any public customer service experience. Going to report to head office. Don't waste your time or $$ at this dump."}
{"text":"This restaurant was bad from the start. There was a distinct stench as soon as we walked in the door and got worse as we entered the dining room. It really made it tough to even eat my meal.  The silverware was not very clean and my glass of water was sticky on the outside.  Our waitress was super nice, that was about the only bright spot.  The food was not very good in my opinion, but the rest of my family said they enjoyed their meals.   I would not choose to eat here given almost any alternative."}
{"text":"Very homely atmosphere....good breakfast menu...kind of place where u'd want 2 go with ur family for a sunday brunch"}
{"text":"This is a place that is fun to go to if you just left the bars and have the munchies.  The food is okay.. oily.. not that great tasting either.  The employees seem a little disgruntled.  I have seen people bring work here and eat.  I don't actually understand why.  It needs to be a lot brighter for me to come here."}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning at Perkins Restaurant & Bakery.  It apparently opened at 6am but when I got there about 6:45am, there were no servers or hosts in sight.  The sign at the door said to wait to be seated ... so I did ... then I finally sat myself.  There was another fella waiting to be seated ahead of me (he waited) and we were the only two in the restaurant for a while so it's not like the servers were busy taking care of others.  I built my own breakfast and had a couple fried eggs, toast, bacon and homestyle potatoes.  It was a good breakfast.   When I was finished, no one gave me my bill so I went to the cash to pay.  A couple servers were there talking about one's dog that attacked another dog recently and was going to get sued.  They kept talking while ringing my bill in.  It was like I wasn't even there.  I would think that good customer service would mean they would pause their conversation while taking care of me and then carry on once I've left.  The restaurant is attached to the Holiday Inn so you have to take a parking ticket to get in but the restaurant validates the ticket so parking is free for two hours."}
{"text":"Good old American style breakfast near the airport. Great value so if you have time eat here before you head to your flight."}
{"text":"We love their wonderful wednesdays because of our favorite server and their food is pretty darn good. Their garden side salads are always fresh and very appetizing and we like their grilled tilapia and shrimp dinner, and their salmon and pasta dinners. The kitchen does a nice job presenting an appealing and tasty meal. It's always a pleasure to dine here for a casual dinner out!"}
{"text":"For a Perkins its a decent place. quick service. Open 24/7 which is always helpful. Several hotels near by so if you get in late and need a bite to eat this is your place. You can walk from many of the hotels to this location."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and haven't had a bad experience yet. The waiters/waitresses have all been friendly and helpful. I enjoy their breakfast specials way more than their other menu items. Every time I have ordered their breakfasts, they have been spot on and exactly what I order. Their other menu items (sandwiches/burgers) have been mediocre, and I have had to pick out rotten pieces of lettuce from the salad.  Definitely recommend this place if you craving eggs, hashbrowns and sausage/ham/bacon."}
{"text":"3.1415.....pie pie pie!!! Who cannot love a nice slice of pie. After a delicious dinner my friend suggested to come to this place to order pie. He mentioned that they make them fresh every day with a wide selection. The restaurant certainly didn't disappoint, there were 8 different types. I ordered the caramel Apple pie to go. Not to mention they are a breakfast and brunch restaurant. My friend has been here for brunch and only had great things to say about it. So if you're ever in Pickering come here for breakfast and don't miss the pie"}
{"text":"Oh Perkins them Perkins... I really can't understand how did I make it there - probably because all the restaurants around were already discovered, and it was close to the Royal Inn where we were usually renting the cars.  There is nothing really wrong with Perkins - it is just a place where kids are bored to death by their grandmas sitting around, chatting about something very important. If I was a kid, I would beware of my parents intention to visit Perkins, and hide under the bed.  Family place, family food. Good for veggie folks, because seems like even \"meat\" there is made of soy, and all the rest - of recycled carton.  Very strict and sloooow moving old ladies roleplaying servers, and looking like their client grandmas - but without the kids under control.  For the price I've paid, I was not even annoyed that much about a small, funny portion of something ultra-light, and just drove downtown to get some real food."}
{"text":"We often end up at Perkins late at night when we are craving pancakes. :) You can count on this location for fast friendly service. My favorite item is the chocolate chocolate chip muffin. The soup is not half bad. I guess it is basically what you would expect from a chain like this. What makes this location stand out is the good service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food, especially for late at night. They have a $5.99 AYCE pancake option, and half off all appetizers at night. Prices are pretty competitive. Even their cheaper entree options (eggs in a hole) are moderately filling.   Service wasn't superb, but not shoddy either. Definitely come here to take advantage of the prices."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Friendly employees. Server was okay.  It much to say here. Went in for hangover food in a hurry. I got the heart mans breakfast. My food was okay. My friends on the other hand... did not look appealing. She got a build your own breakfast. Eggs and pancakes were okay I guess. The breakfast potatoes she got looked fake. But what can you say with a corporate store on a budget? The lemon in my water was old. I work in restaurant industry. I know what they look like. Crippled and slimy. Server was good with getting what we needed. She was quick and to the point though. I was hungover..... so yeah it wasn't horrible. I got fueled up lol"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, and neither time was particularly enjoyable.  The food itself is fine; exactly what you'd expect from a Perkins.  I tried one of their newer omelets, and it was surprisingly tasty.  I had that problem where I was too full to eat more but wanted to keep eating...  The service, however, leaves much to be desired.  The first time I went was on a Sunday around noon, so it was pretty busy.  My boyfriend and I stood in front of the podium waiting for someone to come to put our names on the list.  When someone finally came, he first took the name of someone who had come in after us, like we weren't even there.  It took a while to be seated, but that's understandable since it was about time for Sunday brunch.  The second time was again on a Sunday around noon, but it wasn't near as busy.  Our waitress took our orders promptly, but afterwards, the quality of service plummeted.  My water glass was empty for at least 15 minutes before getting a refill, twice.  The waitress had walked past our table many times, but didn't even look at us to see how we were doing.  Our food took forever to come, and I understand there were five of us so that can take a while, but this was ridiculous.  And the waitress didn't say a thing the whole time.  When the food did come, it was warm, so at least the meal itself was good.  I asked for a box, but it never came.  I ended up asking for one at the counter myself to avoid waiting probably another half hour.  Overall, our waitress stopped at our table maybe five times total, and never apologized for the long wait or even noticed that we were pretty upset with our service.  In addition, several of the other employees were arguing loudly in earshot of customers, which I think is pretty unprofessional.  I can't say I'd recommend going here, and if you do, expect to wait."}
{"text":"An interesting bit: when you first walk in, you're asked to sign in with your license plate number if you're not staying at the adjacent Holiday Inn. A bit odd, but we were borrowing a car, and got to know the license number real fast 'cause we ate here several times!  The food is delicious. The usual Perkins fare. The need to have a soothing, hot meal is inversely proportional to the temperature outside. It's the digestive equivalent of a warm bath. Especially when they honor special requests. Some of the best customer service I've seen in a long time.   My only complaint would be that at least twice, bits of egg shell were mixed in with the eggs. That was distracting and not good. I didn't send it back because I was so hungry, I just tried to work around it. There were so many, you'd think they did it on purpose so we'd get more calcium, or something. No thanks! I do that to my gardens, but it's not for me. Also, it's not really a complaint but an observation: no veggie burgers. Kinda weird. I think they'd sell a lot of them if they had them.  The orders were always delivered correctly; the service was courteous, and they had lots of patience for weary travelers. We usually went as the two of us, but our last visit included five, and they still did a fantastic job. We had to leave before I finished my coffee, and a kind waitress (not even the one working our table) took notice and brought me a fresh coffee in a to-go cup! Fabulous! Bless her heart!  We'd definitely go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Waitress gives you wrong food then says you ordered wrong. Cool. Thanks Perkins for the horrible over priced meal I didn't order. I got some weird dish with hash browns in my pancakes and scrambled eggs. I despise scrambled eggs (the army ruined them) and these looked just like army scrambled eggs. They didn't look fresh at all and I know I would never order them.    Update::: she heard me telling my friend when we got the bills and walks back to tell me I'm wrong, that what she wrote down is right. Even though I have never ordered scrambled eggs once in my life and everything on the plate was wrong.   I have never been treated so rudely by a server. I work in the industry so I get it. It can be a shitty job but if something is clearly wrong I fix it instead of being rude, condescending and mean."}
{"text":"Great Eats! Great quality food and they give you an abundance of it. The plates came quite fast and service was greeted with a smile. Food tasted sooo good, I had French Toast, Pork Sausage, Country style potatoes and eggs all for a very reasonable price.  Next time I'm in Toronto, this will be my regular spot to eat for breakfast.  Eat here for breakfast, you wont be sorry.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place was only \"ok\".  Not downright bad, definitely not particularly good.  I got an omelet with pepper jack cheese and the \"garden mix\" (green peppers, onions, and celery).  It came with homefries and 3 pancakes.  All for just under $9.  Not a bad price considering the ridiculous amount of food you get, but I don't really NEED that much food, and it wasn't very good food.  The pancakes were pretty good; I had them with the wild berry sauce, since I can't stand that fake \"maple\" syrup that restaurants serve--so kudos to them for offering 3 different syrup choices for pancakes (maple syrup, wild berry syrup, and peach syrup).  The hashbrowns were also decent.  My omelet was pretty nasty and I ended up just eating half of it.  The pepper jack cheese tasted cheap and bland and the peppers onions and celery (....still a bit baffled by the inclusion of celery) was just not a great combo.  Kind of annoyed that cheese counts toward one of the \"free\" toppings in the \"create your own omelet\"...shouldn't an omelet just...COME with cheese?  I had a few sips of my boyfriend's coffee and it tasted pretty good.  Service was average, and we got our food fairly quickly.  The bill for the 2 of us came to about $22 (before tip).  We spent a couple bucks less at Courier Cafe last weekend, for better food and a more interesting atmosphere.  Definitely will be going back to Courier Cafe, not so sure about Perkins."}
{"text":"Wow, I love Perkins! I've been to this building in its many previous incarnations (Tucker's Marketplace, Chinese buffet) but this one has got to be my favourite.  I have come here a couple of times now, and plan on coming back regularly for breakfast.  It's a big space, and it's usually busy when I've come for breakfast on the weekend. The booth seats are kind of uncomfortable, but that's pretty much the only negative comment that I have.  When you order coffee, you get a whole pot at the table which is great for refills. I like getting the build-a-breakfast for $10.95, it's huge and a great deal! I usually get eggs, bacon, tater tots (soooo yum) and pancakes that actually taste light and fluffy. You also get your choice of three syrups. I want to try their cinnamon roll French toast next time...it sounds amazing! On my visits, the manager was very active in the restaurant and came by to make sure we were having a great visit. He asked how we heard about them, and thanked us for our business. You can sense that he truly does care about his patrons.  When you're done, they have some fresh baked pies and muffins to bring home too. Service has been fast and efficient, and I'm really happy that I have a new breakfast spot! I hope they are here to stay."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food here but I've never been thrilled with the service.  Just yesterday I had to cue the server to take our order after being there for 20 min.  This surprised me because her tag was labeled as Supervisor.  I guess I had higher expectations of her.  Things were a bit better after this.    The restroom clearly hadn't been cleaned from the day before, so there was toilet paper on the floor, etc.  I didn't really care to see that at 9am.  I must note that there is a baby change table built into the counter top, which I'd never seen before.  Good idea.  I tried the Border Grilled Chicken Omelet, which is a calorie counter meal.  It is served with fruit and one piece of dry toast.  I quite enjoyed it and was grateful not to feel stuffed afterward, even though I ate it all.  From a pocketbook perspective, it was a steal."}
{"text":"Have not eaten at a Perkins in years.  My husband was hungry for pancakes and we were in the area of this restaurant for dinner.  He had the two pancakes, two sausage patties and two eggs and two toast menu item.  He said the pancakes and eggs were fine, the sausage and toast so-so.  I had a bite of his sausage Patti and it tasted really, really processed.    I had two potato pancakes that were surprisingly good.  They had chives in them and were crispy and tasty.  Not so much for the bacon that came with it.  The bacon was limp-not as cooked/crispy as I prefer.l however it had a smokey flavor that enhances the taste.  The cup of applesauce that came with it was nothing special.  Tastes like the apple sauce that comes out of a jar.  It would have been a tad better if it had been served warm.    We did not try any of the delectable bakery items they showcase by the checkout register."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for breakfast in a while. I used to go regularly because of the really great customer service & homey feel. Something has definitely changed. I noticed a lot of new faces. Took a while just to order coffee which never used to happen. And now they don't even have the turkey sausage I always used to order. Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good except for bitterest coffee in my life. Even pancake syrup was bitter. Waitress was inattentive. She brought cream when we asked for milk for coffee. She completely forgot we asked for water refill and disappeared. I usually give more tip but just gave 10% because of her poor service. Don't come on busy Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"A place like Perkins delivers you exactly what you're looking for.  Consistency.  While nothing on their menu fills in the blank in \"this place has the best _______\", just about all of their menu entries are decent.    I'm a breakfast guy, so I like to order off that part of the menu when I can.  Their omelettes are very good - more filling than I always expect.  For me, all eggs require toast, so I get a little sad when I see that you get ONE side with your breakfast.  Well, I like hashbrowns (with cheese, of course), so I get that.  THEN I have to add toast.  Harrumph.  I guess there's worse things in the world than racking up your order...   Our recent visit to Perkins was on a holiday (Valentine's Day - no, it wasn't a date) on top of being a Sunday at 10:30am.  But, the glut of people in the lobby cycled through efficiently and we were seated in no time (not bad for a party of 6).  Service was solid, considering how packed the place was.    Perkins is a solid place to grab some food, coffee, or pastries.  While it's not the sexy \"let's try something new and exotic\" place, it's a good stand-by for a reliable meal with no surprises."}
{"text":"I got sick after eating here... never again. Is the kitchen dirty or what? I really wish there were more locally-owned late night places to eat. Also, the super sweet server working was clearly overwhelmed; I almost got up and started bussing tables for her."}
{"text":"Love Perkins for breakfast! Food was really good. Big portions and reasonable priced. This restaurant is always clean and the servers are really friendly. They have a new breakfast potato, and it was seasoned with some type of spices & so good. And they always have coupons online to use!!"}
{"text":"This is a review based on coffee and dessert. and NOT the breakfasts.  Breakfasts are actually not bad, though I've had better (I'd say 2.5 stars for breakfast).    After a community event in the NE, I was trying to figure out a place to go for coffee and dessert, but the NE isn't exactly filled with many choices besides McDonalds.  Not feeling in the mood to drive  across town or go downtown with my aunt and friends, I decided to go to Perkins as it was the only place I could think of (it was a bakery too after all).  Boy was that a mistake.  Now the waitress, she was attentive, though she was trying to too hard to cover for the inadequacies of the kitchen.  It was 9pm on a saturday, at it was an empty restaurant.  I first ordered a cake on the menu.  Was then told that it wasn't available, and I had to choose something else.   I then ordered a brownie sundae.  After a few minutes, she came back and told me no brownies around, and told that they made very few in general and nothing was to be had.  She then went through with what they did had, and giving her and the resto one more chance, decided to take a chance on the lava cookie sundae.    Now a lava cookie should be warm, with gooey chocolate fudge in the center.  The heat and chocolate meant to compliment the coolness of the ice cream.  Wellll....  The cookie was dead cold.  Worse, the supposedly freshly described cookie was so hard, I honestly couldn't break it hitting it with my spoon.  And when I bit into it, it was just stale and unpleasant.  So much so, I lost my appetite altogether, and combined with the whole comedy of errors, I just left.  Sorry people, but to find out every choice I made missing and absent, and then be given a horrible dessert... well, I promised myself I won't make that mistake ever again."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is 24/7, there's not many places to get anything to eat late at night.  Also they have pie, so that's always a good thing."}
{"text":"Even though it is an incredibly busy evening with it being Saint Patricks day, the waitress was busy but still paid attention to her customers, greeted me with a smile along with an awesome attitude. The security guard stood off to the entrance the entire time I have been in the restaurant, guess I've never noticed the presence of a security guard any other night I've been in here. Customers seemed to be content this evening, one lady is just eating and reading her book, a few others are in conversations, a few late night dates are here, & just your average joe who works evenings, etc.  the service was super great, the food was good, and over all this was a great experience."}
{"text":"Perkins is a reliable choice when dining with my parents.  They like the choices between breakfast and dinner.  The addition of the Coca cola machine with so many flavors is great.   I lean to breakfasts when I go.  I liked my omelette with ham and veggies at this visit.  This location off of HWY 151 is crowded on weekends but it is big enough that the wait is not too bad.  Only negative is sometimes cleanliness is lacking.  But it has improved lately."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my girlfriend for lunch. We were seated right away. We decided to order from the smokehouse menu.  I got the BBQ pulled pork, slaw and fries, she got the brisket with baked beans and tots. We cut our sandwiches in half so we could share. The brisket was very good. The pulled pork was a bit peppery for my taste. The slaw tasted like it was missing something so I salted it and it was a little better, but I've had better. The baked beans were nothing special.   The server never came back to check on us to see if we needed anything and didn't offer to refill drinks until we were done eating.  This was only our second time there. We hope to get back and have the brisket before the summer is over."}
{"text":"I've always been OK with eating at Perkins. However, my recent experience was so unpleasant that I have to write about it. My vegetarian friend ordered a Baja Benedict which is basically vegetarian except for a couple of bacon pieces on top of the eggs. She clearly stated that she wanted Baja Benedict without bacon. Simple. When the food come out, there are bacon on top of the eggs and when she pointed out to the server she took my other friend's fork and scooped the bacon out in front of us - her filthy fingers touched the food I'm pretty sure. This is so unprofessional and not sanitary,"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for breakfast yesterday morning. We found the food to be very very bland and prepackaged type things similar to Denny's or Cora's. ( both of which we dislke ) The servings of meat are very small ( ie. 2 strips of bacon or sausage ), formerly frozen hash browns and I think scrambled eggs from a barrel or carton not a shell. The prices seemed high for what we got, the food was not served very hot and the coffee was $2.95 each as well.  We had the build a breakfast which is $8.95 on weekdays and $10.95 on weekends.  Service was not bad but we will not be returning due to the other factors I have listed."}
{"text":"We've tried this Perkin's a number of times, while the servers are very attentive and friendly, the muffins are delicious - a total MISS on their omelets and food.  We ate breakfast there yesterday, ordered an omelet and not only did it look disgusting, a thin egg with watery ingredients set inside and a half slice of cheese atop on a portion of the omelet.  To make things worse - egg shell in the omelet - it was a disgusting pile of mush.  We have breakfast there before and it wasn't this bad, but we've also tried it for dinner and it wasn't good.  Unfortunately, I doubt we'll now even return for breakfast after such a disgusting omelet."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast a couple of months ago with a friend.. and I was craving for breakfast and he came to this place. We walked in the waitress asked for our license plates and to write it down.. I told her straight up we aren't going to do this.. and it's ridiculous and not even 5 star restaurants do that.. why are we going to give you our license plate number when this restaurant looks like we should be asking for the food certificate and other freaking licenses? She got offensive I can tell with the look on her face but I told her boldly,  grab us a seat please and don't give us a headache.. I came here to have breakfast and get out not for you to stalk me.. she rudely got us a seat at the back. I had the eggs Benedict and sausage and bread and it was decent.. Nothing to complain about but just because of that service alone, I would never come back here. Watch who you hire next time guys.. I always say, whoever you hire really and truly represents your company.. Becareful because you lose potential Regulars. Duh"}
{"text":"Average food, comparable to food you would be served at Denny's. (I personally think Denny's is better). They have an \"all you can eat pancakes\" option for \"late night bites\" which is a little over $6 which includes 5 pancakes. They do not let you share and refuse to bring another plate when asked. Me and my boyfriend always feel sick to the stomach after hardly eating anything here."}
{"text":"Good food and nice waitresses but there was a very rude woman working the register. I just asked about the muffins deal and she was so upset and rude. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I have not one good thing to say about Perkins except that it is finally closed!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I can't really choose between Perkins and IHOP because they are both equally BAD. Perkins was dark and depressing and the food was extremely oily. Ask yourself: Do you want to start your day with breakfast (or lunch or dinner for that matter) at this place?"}
{"text":"Wow.  Damn good salmon steak dinner, two sides (I got steamed veggies and tomato basil soup), and dinner roll.  All for $11.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Thought we should try this place since we were visiting from California. Service was really bad! Didn't get our drinks til almost 30 minutes while people who came after us received their food and evrything first. Servers seems mad and annoyed. She rolled her eyes and was really rude. She wasnt helpful! Really don't recommend this place at all. PERIOD!!! Doesn't even deserve 1 star!!"}
{"text":"Friday night was terrible. I had just picked my blind mother and her guide dog from Amtrak and got us all checked in at our hotel when my mom said she was very hungry. We both had never been to Champaign/Urbana so we were unsure of where to go. Like always I checked yelp. I found Perkins and we thought it sounded wonderful. We arrived at about 7:40pm. The hostess looked like she was getting ready to leave for the night, but seated us anyway. Things looked very promising. Our waiter came to the table and he seemed really nice. When it came time to order, he wrote nothing down. After he walked to the back, he came back out to the front and started playing on the claw machine for children. Another worker finally informed him he had food ready, which I thought it would be my mother's soup and salad. It turned out to be nothing apparently because he walked right back out with no food. I saw him go to 2 other tables checking up on them and bringing them out small items they requested. But there was absolutely no service for us. 25 minutes after we placed our order our drinks were empty and our salads and soup hadn't arrived. We ended up leaving the restaurant around 8:25 after not receiving any food. I informed what looked like a manager how long we were waiting and that we just decided to leave.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Anything outside of some pancakes is putrid. I ordered a dish with ham, potatoes (literal tater tots) and the most disgusting processed cheese.   If you're looking for quality breakfast food there are much better options including Giant Eagle where you can grab a box of Eggo Waffles.   However, the pancakes are quite good and I'd still give it a leg-up over Denny's if you need a quick bite at an odd hour."}
{"text":"Ever noticed as the music gets louder and wilder, the food and service get poorer. So with this place. Last year when I visited several times it was a pleasure. This year each visit keeps getting worst and worst. Why would management think they are catering to rock concert groupies? Could it be the hiring of cheap young inexperienced managers will ruin this chain too ? At least turn down our speakers if you are playing tunes(?) for the cooks!"}
{"text":"I would study here late night because they offer the endless coffee pot where they will refill your coffee all night! I've also eaten breakfast here with my parents before a football game!"}
{"text":"Bad service, super slow. Don't come here if you really wanna just get something to eat. 30 mins waiting, can't believe it. The server just drop the plates in my table, so rude!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  We were there for breakfast at 7am.  Coffee cups were brought to us ice cold.  The booster seat had a narrow bottom, which my son tipped over twice before I went out to the vehicle to get the one I remembered we had, but he was already too scared to sit in any booster.  The high chair brought for our 9 month old was sticky all over and even had large chunks of food from the previous child.  Kids can be brutal on those high chairs, ours no exception, so I don't expect them to be pristine, but that thing was downright nasty.  Finally, the regular syrup had a weird flavor I couldn't put my finger on at first, but finally decided it reminded me of cloves.  I love cloves in mulled cider and pumpkin pie, but not in maple syrup.  Besides, my spouse remembered the syrup being real maple syrup, not the imitation we were served.  This particular Perkins has been our first stop every time we get off the Amtrak over the last 10 years, but next time we will opt for Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"We had a great experience during my first time here.  Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  We went for breakfast and it was delicious! The pancakes had crispy edges, and the hash browns were seasoned well.  It did take a little longer than I expected to get our food, but it was a busy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"I stopped by Perkins for a quick bite with my boss and a co-worker recently. I was not expecting much going in but it turned out to be a fairly pleasant experience. It's a really dated restaurant and the food was just average. That being said, portions are quite large, the items on the menu are inexpensive and the service we received was great!"}
{"text":"Can I not even do a star? It was that bad! My friend and I just left perkins it was absolutely disgusting! Our sever was horrible and lacked people skills. Then when we got our food my plate was covered with little black curly hairs, so I can only assume there was hair in the food as well (and the food looked horrible anyways- I wouldn't eat it even if there wasn't hair!!), and when the server put down my friends plate on our table his chicken strips fell off the plate onto the table, and the server didn't even offer to bring him out different chicken. So we ended up leaving without eating. It was ridiculous! And I would not recommend anyone to go there! It was dirty, and the service was horrible and their food was just as bad! OVER ALL HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"U think this place is disgusting, im reviewing for the soul purpose of the story you're about to read.   A good buddy of mine went to lunch there with his son, who was 2 at the time, I believe. His mother was also in attendance, in the midst of wrapping up extras and exchanging money to pay the tab, there was a mix up.   A Big Mix Up! They walked out on the tab, not on purpose but the humorous part of the story, to me anyways, is the fact that not 1, or 2 but 3 generations of the family walked out on the tab. Wrong of me? I dont know, I found it pretty dam comical.   To wrap it up, Perkins is nasty and has bad service."}
{"text":"I hate leaving negative reviews (you can check my review history) and if I have something bad to say about a place, I tend to keep in to myself in hopes that it was just a fluke, but this was absolutely horrible.  My husband and I stopped here around midnight on our way back to Minnesota after a concert in Milwaukee.  There were 2 tables with a grand total of three patrons when we walked in.  We were not greeted, though the waitress looked right at us and knew we were there. After a minute, she told us she'd be with us in a minute. Okay, no problem.  We got seated and ordered, but it was apparent that we were inconveniencing her as she wrote down our order.   I ordered soft-poached eggs and toast, my favorite.  What I got, however, were two extremely hard-poached eggs.  I'm sorry, but that is unacceptable.  I am always wary about ordering poached eggs at a restaurant, because they can be tricky, but she said they do soft-poached. If you say your cook can do soft-poached, he should be able to do soft-poached.  Of course, Sunshine was nowhere to be found when I realized they were actually very hard, and I wouldn't have wanted to inconvenience her even more.  We ate and then waited for 5 minutes and were never brought our check, so we decided to just go up to the counter.  After a minute or two, our waitress came out with drinks for another table that had come in.  She saw us, didn't say anything and walked back into the kitchen.  We assumed she would be back momentarily, but she never did.  After 5 minutes, a kind woman who had a view of the kitchen said \"Excuse me, there's people waiting at the counter.\"  After another minute, a woman came out with the title of manager on her name tag.  Shouldn't a manager be making sure that everything is running smoothly throughout the entire restaurant, to ensure customer happiness and comfortability??  At this point, there was at least 1 person on the floor for every 3 customers. There's no reason we should have waited so long.  I was a waitress throughout high school and college, so I know what it's like to have many things going on at once. It can be challenging, for sure, but it's very doable.  And as I already mentioned, there was hardly anybody in the place.    At least my cup of coffee kept me alert for the 3-hr ride home.  Perkins, get some new staff or train them to smile."}
{"text":"The food at Perkin's is consistently terrible.  The breakfast menu is decent but anything refered to as 'dinner' or 'salad' can be safely ignored.  Gets points for being open 24 hours and having a really eclectic mix of drunks at 2:45 AM."}
{"text":"Poor quality food. Overcharged and double charged for items. Disappointing. I have not found this with all Perkins, just this one."}
{"text":"The service is always great. The food is always good. The menu is loaded and varied. The deserts are fantastic.   The Wife and I go here often and have never been disappointed. One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Sadly, yet another chain restaurant don't.  I went here with a bunch of my out-of-state relatives as well as my family and parents, and my dad nearly got food poisoning.  We went for brunch and the restaurant seemed like any old Perkins.  Everyone's food seemed fine, until my dad tried to cut into his fried fish.  Sure, it was fried on the outside, but the fish on the inside was semi-FROZEN.  How in the world do you serve deep fried frozen fish?  We told the server who got the manager and he apologized and gave my dad a $2 off voucher for his next meal.  Yes, that is right, Perkins wanted my dad to come back to their restaurant and eat another death-ensuring meal costing $2 less.  The manager did not even offer to compensate for my dad's entree or ask if he wanted anything else to eat instead.  Had Perkins handled the situation appropriately, I would have rated them better, but they seemed to have forgotten the customer in this case and did not understand that things could have been a lot worse.  The manager in this restaurant definitely needs to be retrained as do the cooks and those eating there should be advised that their food could also be just as inedible if they do not pay attention."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. We were waiting at the table for over 20 minutes before the waitress came to take our order. My wife and I walked out and the manager acted surprised when I told her we were very unhappy"}
{"text":"Perkins is akin to Denny's or IHOP in my eyes and has food that is consistently lousy. That said, it's quite cheap and there are free refills on coffee and soda. I would say the pie is decent, at best."}
{"text":"Horrible.  I will never come back to this place. I came for breakfast and ordered the biscuit, gravy, sausage and bacon breakfast. The portions were very small.  I left there still hungry. The bacon looked and tasted like it had been thrown in the microwave for 30 sec then put on the plate.  Its the first time I have ever left bacon on my plate. Coffee was ok, and they left a caraff so you could refill it yourself.  I could see older people loving this place."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this place out for breakfast. We came in just before 8am on a Saturday morning and it was pretty dead inside. We were kindly greeted by a waitress as soon as entering and then quickly seated. Our booth was very roomy with a large table and brown leather banquets. After taking our drink orders she gave us time to flip through the menus.   I love that they offer all day breakfast here as well as fresh baked goods and pies. I particularly had my eye on the peanut butter silk cream pie but let's get through breakfast first.  Our waitress came back with our drinks and took our orders. Hubby ordered a coffee and they brought over a small carafe filled with coffee which I found to be a nice touch as you always had a hot refill waiting for you. I ordered a tea which also came with a small carafe of hot water and a tea bag on the side. However they serve Red Rose tea here which is one of my least favourite brands of tea...  Our food was ready in a short amount of time and we were ready to dig in. By this time the restaurant was starting to fill up so we were happy we just beat the rush of patrons coming in.  I decided to order the build a breakfast which comes with 2 eggs, choice of meat, choice of potatoes, and choice of bread item. I got scrambled eggs which were cooked simply and perfect, two slices of crispy turkey bacon, crispy hash browns which I loveddd - they are more like shredded potatoes that are browned on one side to get a nice crunchy golden brown crust and finally 3 buttermilk pancakes topped with a pat of butter. The pancakes were Soooo good!! Definitely the best part of my meal!! Thick, fluffy, buttery, and slightly sweetened. The pancakes come with a caddy of 3 different syrups to try but my favourite one was the berry flavoured one.  Hubby got the Triple Egg Dare ya which comes with 3 eggs, 3 slices applewood bacon, 3 sausage links, 2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 slices of french toast and crispy hash browns. He also really enjoyed his meal but his favourite part was the French Toast. Thick slices of sweet brioche bread perfectly cooked with a light dusting of powdered sugar and a pat of butter it was also heavenly!  Portions here were hugeee and we both could only tackle about half of our meals. We waited for a our waitress to return to ask to get it packed to go. Unfortunately our waitress took forever to return. I understand that restaurant was starting to get full at that time but she could of at least come back to check up on us. After finally getting her to get the takeout containers we needed another container and a bag for it all and again she went MIA. We flagged another waitress this time who kindly got us what we needed very quickly. Finally we waited on our waitress for a 3rd time because I still had my eye on getting a slice of that pie. When our waitress finally made a return she came to put the bill on the table without us even requesting it. I asked to order a slice of the pie and she graciously went to go check for me. Sadly the peanut butter pies were not ready yet so I didn't get my fix.  Overall I have to say the food was perfect! Hugeee portions at a reasonable price and everything was very tasty. The restaurant has a very homey feel and although service was fantastic in the beginning of our meal I wish it followed through as the restaurant got busier. However despite that little flub up I will still be making a return visit as I still have my eye on that pie!"}
