{"text":"The food and restaurant decor were good. However, we were there on a cold winter night and the restaurant wasn't very well heated. Also, it was difficult to call a cab to pick us up as none of the cab drivers seemed to know where it was and the restaurant does not have any signs outside."}
{"text":"The ENTIRE time I was at Gossip Restaurant, I kept thinking \"how the hell does this place make any money?\". Who opens up a restaurant at Exhibition Place, tucked in a corner with little to no signage, and hopes to reap profit? BUT, I came out a loyal customer in hopes to return & here are the reasons why:  - There was a cute boy ready and happy to hang our coats upon entering the restaurant.  - The waitress, in all her 19 years of innocence, clueless of how to open a wine bottle, or, of what in the world a profiterole is, was STILL cute as a friggin button and highly apologetic for her lack of information.  - The owner was promptly walking the floor back and forth, big smile and laptop in hand, showing us pictures of the dressed up patio in the summer, offering lots of food advice, restaurant history and open invitations to return.  - The ceiling has been sound proofed to prevent the echo of knife hitting plate and gossip floating away from tables.  - Even the winterlicious menu boasts a 6lb lamb shank and imported profiteroles from Italy.   - The wine list, while small and condensed, has been put together tastefully and just because you order the cheaper option doesnt mean its going to be a bad one.   Collectively, a great restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for winterlicious.  The food and ambiance was very good.  If I were to rate it on those alone it would have gotten a higher rating.  As a whole though, the bar was rather disappointing.  We were advised by our waitress that the bar had been depleted over the holidays (its now February) and the selection was limited.  There were no top rail liquors available, no bourbon, and the wine selection by the glass was red, pinot grigio or chardonay.  You also could not order off of the regular menu.   We wondered if the restaurant even opens at all during the winter months and just opened strictly for winterlicious given the lack of supplies.    Amelia the GM was great, always attentive and took care of any concerns or questions.   Its a shame because I suspect that given its location, this restaurant is vastly different during the summer months as the patio looked like it was pretty amazing and the ratings are probably not indicative of the seasons."}
{"text":"I also wonder how this place makes money.  Friday night dinner with my wife, and we got there at 7pm.  One other couple in the large restaurant.  That was it.  Aside from that, the service & food were excellent.  We came with a Travelzoo voucher, and all came out fantastic.  It's a shame about the location, no one will ever know about this place.  What stopped me from giving a 5: price.  It's a lot of money for very good food, but I wouldn't call it a \"deal\" if I were paying full price.  Also, the website doesn't even have their address & phone number! C'mon!"}
{"text":"Loved the intimate and beautiful atmosphere! Patio has a great view of the lake. Definitely have to come back in the summer. Wine was really nice, and the food was fantastic. We had a date night where it was 3 courses with some chocolate in it. We enjoyed the salad, the steak to the truffle we helped create and get to bring home. Amelia the manager and our brunette sweet server was amaze balls :)"}
{"text":"The food at Gossip is good, though I'm not sure if it's worth the price, or the travel to get there.  Once you enter Gossip you can tell that a lot of money was put into making this place look nice. But for as nice as it looks, it is as equally cold and rather corporate feeling. The place doesn't have much of a vibe to it, as it's not very busy and the employees are often standing around talking to each other while waiting for the next thing they can do.  Thankfully when I went there I was using a TravelZoo gift certificate that I received as a gift. If I had not used one, the bill would have been more expensive than a lunch trip to Canoe. While the food at Gossip is good, it was not as special as Canoe.  For the apps, we had the Lemon Grass Steamed Mussels, and the Braised Short Rib Ravioli. The mussels were good and had a nice spice to the broth. Though a lot of the mussels were on the smaller side. It did come with a generous portion of bread though. The sauce on the short rib ravioli was really excellent. Perhaps my favourite bite of the meal. For our mains we both got the Smoked Braised Lamb Shank. We were both excited that the lamb shank was smoked, but the smoke wasn't very strong. At first we could taste it, but then it was overwhelmed by the sauce. The sauce, while delicious in it's own right, was a weird choice for the lamb shank. It came off as more of a BBQ sauce. I would have liked the taste of the lamb to sing a little more, and for the smokey flavour to come through. The grilled seasonal vegetables were well cooked and had just the right amount of crispness. For dessert we had the Chocolate Creme Brulee. It was a nice dessert. The chocolate had a nice flavour. Though it was on the tiny side.  If you are thinking of purchasing a TravelZoo coupon, or something like it, I say sure what the heck it's worth checking out. Or if you are thinking of holding a corporate event there I think it would be a swell place. But I dunno if I'd go here on a regular night and pay regular prices."}
{"text":"Been waiting a while to give this place a try. I had seen the nice pictures on their website and curious to see the place for myself. I finally went there with a couple of pals and the food was delicious. The big fountain and outdoor sofas are perfect for summer afternoons. The only problem with the restaurant is the smell of butane, which is strong as you enter. Nonetheless, the serving was good and I will most likely visit again next year."}
{"text":"First off: this place is NOT always a restaurant. I arrived at 5:30pm tonight, and the place was closed for a private event.  Here's how the staff treated some would-be customers: As others have mentioned, this place is in the middle of nowhere. For our last night in Toronto, I decided to bring my daughter and parents here for dinner. During the trek to Gossip, my 6 year old daughter started to feel the need to go to the bathroom. There is nothing around this place, so we ran ahead of my parents to get there. As soon as we walked in, it was clear to me that the place was closed for a private event. Still, my daughter was busting, so I asked if she could just use the bathroom. Again, there is NOTHING around this place. The manager, a dark-haired woman, said, \"No, we are closed to the public.\" \"Please? She's about to have an accident right here.\" \"We are closed! But fine, go.\" I sent my daughter to the bathroom, but the manager caught me shaking my head. She shouted at me, \"Why are you shaking your head?! This is not a public restroom!\" \"Why are you screaming at me? She is six! How about some decency?!\" \"Decency? How about you teach your daughter about personal responsibility?!\" I admit I lost my temper. We had come here for dinner, and I simply asked if my daughter could use the restroom - something no one has ever said no to before, but it hasn't happened often - of course she understands to go before we are going to be gone for a while - and the manager is screaming at me in front of her. Unfortunately, it continued: I responded, \"How is this about personal responsibility? We came here for dinner, and this place is in the middle of nowhere. We thought this was a restaurant.\" The manager shouted back, \"Oh don't try to pull the wool over my eyes!\" This really took me aback. My parents, in their 70s, were trying to catch up to us for what they expected to be a nice meal. \"Update your Yelp page!\" I finally shouted. My daughter came out of the bathroom. We left, and the manager shouted after us, \"ASSHOLE!\" \"I heard that,\" my daughter said."}
