{"text":"They shadily would not answer my question about how much my small lunch box (rice + sweet and sour pork) would cost, but instead, started scooping food into the container that I hadn't fully committed to yet. They probably saw a sucker from a mile away and knew I'm not one for confrontation, and since I do enjoy sweet and sour pork - well, why not?
Rang me up for $9. I'd give it a 4/10 on taste at best, a -1/10 for value, and a 10/10 for their sales. Well played Tsb2000, well played."}
{"text":"This is my go to quick breakfast spot. Bacon, egg, and cheese on toast for $4 isn't too shabby. It's also super convenient since I work right upstairs. 
They have a decent selection for lunch as well. 

The people that work there are friendly and the place is clean. Not a place to sit down but a good grab and go spot."}
{"text":"Save yourself the $9 and go somewhere else! I ordered a chicken avocado wrap. They didn't cut the wrap, it will packed full of romaine and green peppers (very bitter) with no avocado and minimal chicken. I took two bites and threw it out.

My co workers avoid this place like the plague."}
