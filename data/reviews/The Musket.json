{"text":"I would have given 3.5 stars if possible, but I'll round up because of the guns on the walls. Stuffed mushrooms were good but not great, and salads were huge. But the pork hoc...I didn't know what pork hoc was until I read about it in another review, but I learned all about it on my first trip to the Musket. Pork hoc is worth the drive to Advance Dr and suspending belief that you're gonna find a really good meal on this street.  What's not to like? Crunchy pork outside, tender pork inside, and it's lunch the next day. Just make sure you have dijon mustard in the fridge so you can rock out with your hoc out. There were very generous portions in pretty much every dish I saw come out of the kitchen as well.   Parking round back, follow the narrow drive to the left of the place...."}
{"text":"Sorry to hear this place has closed (as of Jul 8, 2017). Came in for lunch but a lone elderly gentleman was in there standing with a cane in one hand and cold beer in the other. It sounded like he hadn't come to terms with it yet. He explained how the owner wanted to sell but didn't want to sell to someone who wanted to continue restaurant. 

Auf wiedersehen Musket."}
{"text":"Tiny portions, ridiculous pricing. Seems regulars got more food than everyone at my table. We asked about garlic bread, specifically if one order was enough to share. They assured us there would be more than enough; there was not, as we were delivered 4 slivers of bread. One of my friends ordered a wine and it tasted musty

Most entrees are over $15 and we had to go get burgers elsewhere afterwards because we were still hungry. The service was also ridiculously slow. I don't know if this place has changed because they were featured on the Food Network recently but it was not great at all."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this place did not measure up. I have a German background and one thing Germans like is their food \"hot\". Everything on our plates was just barely lukewarm and it seemed that the wait staff really didn't care. Even after taking our food back to reheat it came back barely hot. Really disappointing considering this is the type of food I grew up with. Oh well beer was good."}
{"text":"The good - excellent German food!
The bad - dated interior that's seen better days.

The musket is located on an industrial street in Etobicoke, right next to the Dimpflmeier bakery, which I'd bet is the source of the delicious bread served before your meal.

If you have never had authentic sauerkraut or red cabbage, you're in for a treat!  Pair with schnitzel or roulade and you've got a tasty dinner.  Added bonus they have 6 German beers on tap, and Blue Nun wine available from the bar.    

Service was solid, right up till we needed the bill.  Not sure if this is a cultural thing where you have to explicitly ask for the bill?  But when you're sitting at a cleared table with nothing to eat or drink....

A small over sight, not enough to keep me away from the delicious food!"}
{"text":"German pub atmosphere.... different and unique place.

The food was awesome. Hearty German pub food...

However they still have to figure out the service.... lol, service was amusing, but we were not in a rush. Waited quite some time....

Will I go back? Yes, their bbp pork knuckle is that great and unique.... Try it!!"}
{"text":"A great place if you're looking for some comfort German food. 

I ordered the meat platter for two that was shared amongst three friends. The portion size was a very big and could easily fill three people. All the meats were cooked well and were flavorful."}
{"text":"I don't know what the raves are about either. I have been there 3 years ago and the portions were much bigger.  Yes the pork hocks are huge but that's it.

First of our food was tiny we all had the Franz Josef snitzel, which was consisted of a steamed broccoli peace and a cauliflower piece, 3 cubes of cold potatoes.  Service was super slow it was hard to get the servers attention.

Place is dirty and run down. I have been to Austria and Germany and I know how the beer taverns are supposed to be like.  This is simply outdated, tacky and dirty.

The apple strudel was a joke not even close to how it should be like.  Chunks of un pealed dry apples thrown into a greasy shell.  

The bill was huge which I don't mind but not for this.

sorry but this is the truth will never be back!"}
{"text":"Here on business from the USA. I come from a German-based area. Loved the food here. My coworkers and I sampled the jagerschnitzel, ham hocks, and goulash soup. Oh, and the beer of course! All were excellent. The only drawback is when it gets busy. I've never seen more than people working the floor, which leads to long, long, wait times.  If you want to eat and run, this is not your place. If you want to relax and converse, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food, real German fare.
A great place to take the German in-laws.
A pretty grey-haired crowd.
Good beer."}
{"text":"This place is awsome. The price was good. I love the hox from the musket. Its big and very testy. It is Meat lover's paradise."}
{"text":"I decided to go here after reading the great reviews. Dinner was excellent. I had the jaeger schnitzel. I really like the abundance of mushrooms you get. The gravy was very tasty and so were the potatoes. Our waitress was so friendly and knew all of the dishes. She told us her favourites and made us feel at home. Best waitress I have had in a very long time. I can't wait to return. Also note the German beer was a nice touch to my meal. I had the hacker lager. Although the French onion soup and the spaghetti don't make sense.... I don't really care."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my coworkers for my birthday. I have to say they have good food, I ordered the German Pork hock. It's huge and very tasteful, if I have to give some suggestions, I would say the pock hock is a bit too salty for me and I don't really like the side dishes.

I also tried the schnitzel that my coworker ordered, I think that's pretty average. But he seemed to like it.

The waitress seemed very nice, but she was not attentive that day. The decoration is bit too outdated in my opinion. Maybe they can do something about it?

Overall, I think this is a very good restaurant."}

{"text":"This place is so full of Germans! 

The food is authentic and so are the servers' heritage....although their service lacks the efficiency and a-motiveness I expect, so that's really where they're losing points in my mind. 

VERY strange location. Norseman/Kipling on a side street - a real dead zone. It is what I imagine East Berlin used to be like. 

The non-German sides include peculiar Italian choices and baked oysters. My Jaegar-schnitzel came with warm pickled cabbage, fried hash-brown potatoes, and a large pork-schnitzel covered in a mushroom sauce. There was a LOT of mushrooms. Pork was great, though.

Reasonable prices, and the ambiance is warm and comfy."}
{"text":"I was always wanted to try out this restaurant but didn't have chance till my husband watched the TV show\" You gotta eat here\".
Definitely a hidden gem. I didn't expected to hear live my music and dancing.
I loved the atmosphere. 

Anyway, we ordered stuffed mushroom cap which was AMAZING with the German beer!
Unfortunately, the schnitzel I had was okay although I am big fun of schnitzel so I was a bit disappointed.
 
Overall, I liked it because the restaurant reminded me the German restaurant I've visited in Germany...I will try mushroom cap and another entree next time."}
{"text":"Great place. Good food and friendly staff. Bunch of old Germans hang out there. The best schnitzel I have found in Toronto yet. Good strudel too. Needs an update on the decor."}
{"text":"So I saw this place on tv a while back and have wanted to try it ever since. I knew it wasn't a fancy place but I guess I was expecting a little more. It was dated and dark and just seemed kind of unclean. However I just chalked that up to the age and location of the place. 
I ordered the smoked salmon, I was taking a risk as I'm usually not into seafood. I have to say I wasn't impressed. Buttered rye bread, too much salmon, slice of pickle, slice of egg and mayo and some red onion. Not appetizing to say the least. But I tried it. And was pretty disgusted. 
Next I had the jaeger schnitzel, it was ok. The meat was pretty small but the sauce was tasty. But the home fries were only partially cooked and the red cabbage was stinky. 
The service was ok, but since we were the only ones sitting inside the place it could have been better. 
For the regulars it serves it's purpose but I wouldn't recommend it to people."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic German restaurant...
schnitzel was done well and the rest of the meal was good.
Experienced staff with a true Bavarian ambiance...
Definitely a place to come back to..."}
{"text":"When I drove in for dinner, it was interesting to see that The Musket is in an industrial and commercial park plaza.  Further adding to the early 90s ambience of the surrounding area is the payphone at the entrance and the abundance of wood paneling.

Some of the reviews mentioned poor service, but I found the waitress and service to be somewhat appropriate given the old school décor of the place; to the point, and doesn't try too hard.

The Musket doesn't have fancy service, but gets the basics done right, and is seemingly popular with a group of regulars.  It's definitely not trying to appeal to the average Yelper, but more the factory workers that come in after work for a beer, like the group of workers chatting in German over beers after work we saw.  I kind of like the honest, tried and true vibe to the place, trying to appeal to the regulars rather than following all the latest trends.

I ordered some of their classic recipes like Pork Hox, escargots, and smoked pork chops, washed down with some Weiss beer from the tap.  The pork hox was the best I've had in Canada, but didn't compare to the biergartens in Munich, as the skin on the knuckles weren't done as crispy as they were in Germany.  The escargots were ok, and the smoked pork chops was served like the pork box; with big portions fit for two.

I managed to down the pork chops in one sitting, but I easily could have shared with another from my party and still came out satisfied.  I would definitely drop by again if I wanted a taste of Germany done in a classic way."}
{"text":"I've been seeking the same pork knuckle taste I had in my few visit to Europe. I drove as far as Kitchener from Scarborough to look for the same holy flavour (there are some reputable German establishment there which boast  the dish)

At last, I found that foodgasmic flavour here. It's been here all along. The crisp of the skin, the juicy fatty meat. And damn it's big and filling. Did I also mentioned I shared this between 3 ladies.

Came here on a weeknight and it was happening. Seating was pretty full after 8pm on Wednesday. Pretty impressive!

We also ordered a side stuff mushrooms and mushroom sauce snitzels.   All were tasty, and will return for sure!

No need to fly 18 hours anymore for that delicious Bavarian flavour"}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the rave reviews are about....it was mediocre at best and the service was awful.  My husband had the pork hock, it was over cooked and salty, I had the jaeger schnitzel, the \"mushroom sauce\", tasted like a mix, although it had a lot of mushrooms in it, but far too salty."}
{"text":"went to the musket for dinner last friday night with my mom and friend i had the escargot omg it was amazing then for my main meal i had the Jaeger Schnitzel it was to die for i also had the red cabbage it was great made fresh and the spetzel was good too would go back"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem, hard to find restaurant right beside Dimpfelmaier. 
Thanks to Yelp and the positive reviews we ended up at The Musket on Mothers Day.
As Germans, the food was very authentic. Pork Hox and Apple Strudel were excellent. Come with a great appetite to share the meat platter for 2. Definitely an experience seeing this platter being served with 2 large knives stuck into the meat. 
We would give it a full 5 stars if the amenities would have been updated since they where build back in 1993. 
We sure will come back again in the near future to see this Gem being updated to its potential of an excellent authentic German dining experience.

{"text":"- do you like meat?
- do you like picked herring with pickles?
- do you like beer?
- do you like places that are 97% decked out in wood paneling from the 80s?
- answer yes, and go immediately to the musket.
- would've been 5 stars, but all the reviews about service weren't kidding. pretty lax, and not overly attentive. be patient... the food is worth it, and they know it."}
{"text":"So. Good.
I love the classic schnitzel- my husband loves the jäger schnitzel. The red cabbage is delicious- as is everything else we'e tried here. 
A hidden gem- we don't have a car- so whenever we have a rental we make it a date night. The ambiance is old fashioned and depressing- not a beauty- but seriously- it don't mean a thing. Traditional and dated- a hoot to be honest.
Give it a try! Yumyum!"}
{"text":"The Musket does NOT disappoint. My bf and I have been here a couple of times. The first for his birthday. (he's German) 

The location is very non-descript. This is the type of place that you would probably never discover on your own without a recommendation or a tv review. (We first heard about this place on 'You Gotta Eat Here\")

The service was friendly both times that we have been there. 

They do carry some great German beer which is a nice compliment to the meal. 

Both times I have been, I ordered the Rouladen. Amazing. Great portion. Not too big that I couldn't finish it but big enough that I felt full. The red cabbage is sweet and tangy just as it should be.

My bf orders the Jager Schnitzel and says that it reminds him of his grandmothers cooking. The sauerkraut that came as a side with his meal was authentic with peppercorns and all! 

We never order dessert as we can never eat any more after the meal is done. but for my bf's birthday the owner DID come over with some grappa type liquor to have a celebratory shot with us.

We like this place so much that  we plan on taking my bf's mother and father here for a joint mother/fathers' day dinner."}
{"text":"I used to come here with my father over 20 years ago and it used to be authentically Deutsche. Now it's a joke. They play 80's music on the radio and have black waitresses who have no idea what's on the menu. Tables not cleaned and scatteted messes. The food is horrible at half the size. I always got the meat platter and now I feel I get the ends of discarded plates. A travesty. The one waitress I think got fired. The one who expected tips for horrible service. She wouldn't even come to the table she would send the other one over instead. 
Owner now is a drunk. Badly. Sitting at the bar all night and most likely high. Giving out disgusting food. Out of his mind messed up. Complained about the meat platter and in his high he asked what he could do, at least..then offered a free pork hock. ALL FAT. Just offer us fat please.. .oh...please..disgusting. 
Trust me. As a little girl this was the most fantastic place with dancing and people enjoying themselves. Now this is just a carried on wannabe. I make better food at home. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else. At least we will. With all the fine dining in Toronto instead of making this our spot for our Monthaversary we will go ANYWHERE else! Goodbye Musket you might as well close your doors."}
{"text":"Amazing German food in an adorable little restaurant.  Don't let the dated exterior fool you this place is a gem. 

I had the Jäger Schnitzel and it was amazing.  My dad had the Franz Josef Schnitzel and also was very impressed. 

Combined with great service and good German drafts I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"Update, went here again last night with my husband and parents. My husband usually thinks that I am absolutely crazy for being so into food. Well after a few bites of the BBQ pork hox, he just about lost it, Lainey-style.

This time around, we actually ordered some appetizers: smoked oysters, garlic bread, escargot and French onion soup. The smoked oysters and escargot were so-so, the garlic bread was good, according to the dairy-digesting people at the table, and the soup was \"not too salty\", according to my mom. My advice is: skip the appetizers and save room for the mains. Actually, get a salad. Your insides will thank you tomorrow.

The meat dishes as usual were fricking incredible.

The apple strudel was soggy and not very good, obviously microwaved. Apparently the vanilla ice cream was amazing. Service was a bit slow, but with food this great, who cares?"}
{"text":"Busy social place at 5:30pm on a Friday night.  The bar was full of social drinkers and the resto area started filling up slowly after that.

Service is friendly and the food comes out quickly.  Ordered schnitzel and jaeger schnitzel (schnitzel with a mushroom sauce).

Food was excellent and very generous portions mean good value for the prices.  Definitely worth a trip back next time I feel like good German food!"}
{"text":"Long have I waited to finally go and visit the Musket.  I've had this place bookmarked longer than I care to remember.  Being a native of Etobicoke it should be my duty to go to some of the most unique establishments my side of town has to offer.  The Musket is absolutely one of those types of places.

Tucked away in a light industrial area between Kipling and Islington just a tad south of Dundas street west, the Musket is essentially hidden from all the commercial stretches nearby such as the Queensway and Dundas and being so close to Kipling Station realistically it's the kind of place that you really won't come across by accident.  Advance is a street in which most people wouldn't just be passing by and happen to see The Musket and think hmm... 

So that being said this place is practically hidden in plainsight.  There's about 5 or 6 parking spots right at the front but about maybe another dozen and a half in the back.  The west side alleyway has parallel parking as well if it gets that packed.  The place is very low key.  Outside it doesn't have flare, inside it's has a very old school incandescent lighting feel to it.  The lighting fixtures of the stained type glass variety are plentiful yet the lighting is soft and yellow.

The decor is that of Deutschland with steins, football fanfare and a very simple and unassuming feel.  There are some booths but mostly open tables with about half a dozen or so good sized tables outside at the front as well.

While the decor and ambiance may be casual, the menu is sort of old school as well.  The menus look old.  How old they are I don't know as I've never been before.  They have a look that lead me to believe they haven't been changed in a while but logic would lead me to think they would have since you know, inflation and costs of doing business.  Still, the charm of this place is that it feels like it's been around a long time whether it has or it hasn't.  

To start off we ordered the large Krombacher pints.  The beer was poured greater than the 500ml line.  This is how it's done boys and girls.  I'm sick of going to places where they advertise a beer and go as far as to put down the size of the glass (16oz for instance) and then pouring a stupid sifter a little over half where the rest of the glass is head (cough, Paupers Pub and Patois, cough).  Not here folks.  This is a full glass and then some.

After seeing photos of the fare here from a variety of well known Toronto and GTA fellow Yelpers I figured I'd come and pay a visit and order that famous pork hox.  BBQ pork hox (hock, whatever) this is a dish that is somewhere in the dreams of Anthony Bourdain who if he hasn't been here would probably fully appreciate it.

The bbq pork hox is a big meal.  When I say big I don't necessarily mean like Zet's big or Claim Jumper big but rather I ate it all and now I feel awesome big.  We did happen to see a family of 4 order 2 pork hox plates and share among themselves that evening.  The plate comes with a side of both sauerkraut and potatoes.  It's a Fred Flintstone looking hunk of meat bone in on your plate and it simply looks divine.  Take into account the crispy skin (queue Anthony Bourdain's love for pig skin) and the fact that this is an Instagram worthy piece of meat.  

While the large piece of meat is fatty, (it's pork with the skin still on it) it has plenty enough meat on the bone to fill this guy.  I'll be honest, the star of this hunk of meat is that crispy skin though... gotta love it.

The place was pretty busy for a Tuesday evening considering we're in the middle of a lights out industrial area in Etobicoke.  This place is definitely word of mouth and for good reason.  The service was hard to come by because of the place being rather busy and there were only 2 servers doing all the tables and bar but still it's still got a charm, a menu full of meat choices and large glasses of beer.  

Next go around I'm going to try some of the schnitzels or other generous dishes but it did seem for the most part other tables were going all in on the hox."}
{"text":"my first experience here was about ten years ago....it was amazing German food...ten years later..place is still great.  each time i come here my main meal is the pork hock..YUM! i definitely have to share this huge portion with someone.  the skin is so crispy and the meat is so tender!  recently have tried their soups - the goulash and the french onion - both super yummy but it's a bit salty for my taste buds!  they also have a good selection of German beers and the staff is so friendly!  most recently we came here and there was a musician which made the ambience so fun!  love this place!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on the food network show You gotta eat here and decided to check it out. This place is definitely hidden, located in an industrial area in Etobickoe I would have never known this place existed had I not seen it on TV. 

Went with a friend on a Saturday night and the place was not packed, but was still pretty busy. It took a minute for us to be seated. The menu is mostly German with a few other generic items. For an appetizer my friend and I ordered the stuffed mushroom caps (filled with a crab mixture and gratinated). This dish was sub-par, the filling was way too salty, it did have a nice crab taste but the sheer saltiness of the dish overpowered everything else. 

For mains, my friend ordered the Jaeger-schnitzel and I ordered the pork hox. The Schnitzel was decent, the meat was nicely fried and the mushroom sauce over it was creamy, but my friend did complain that this dish, like the appetizer, was over salted. The pork hox however was absolutely to die for! This is a big piece of pork, on the bone with the skin on. It was peppery, fatty and oh so tender! The sides of sauerkraut, potatoes and dijon mustard, made for a nice accompaniment to the hox. Make sure to order this with a German beer to drink (I prefer the hefe-weizen) this will make for the perfect meal. I am a hefty eater but the portion was so large that I could not even finish it! Overall this was easily the best part of the experience, and will likely be the only reason I return to this establishment. 

The place itself is very casual, kind of old world. They have 3 hacker beers on tap, you can not have German food without a nice German beer. The service was bad, our server seemed overwhelmed, was slow to take our order, and fetch our drinks. The food was slow to come out of the kitchen. When she asked us if we wanted bread and we said yes it took her about 20 minuted to get it, by that time I had finished my meal. I will give our server the benefit of the doubt as she did seem overwhelmed and was saying that she had a very busy day, oh well we cant all be on the ball 100% of the time. Overall this place is worth the visit, but avoid it if you are on a low-salt diet."}
{"text":"Okay so two years ago my hubby went to Oktoberfest in Germany without me (jerk - I was too preggers to fly) and since then has been going ON and ON and OOOOON about something called pork hok and how delicious it was and how he wants it again and blah blah. 

So I don't even know how, but he must have been Google searching like a madman and found The Musket. 

We decided to check it out one day when we just happened to be in the area, and its funny because its tucked away on this street that is no where really with nothing on it but a little bakery and this restaurant - total dead zone. 

So we ordered a pork hok each ($20) since hubs insisted that he wasn't going to share his. I asked to have mine not with the traditional potatoes that come with it but with a garden salad and no dressing. The waitress looked at me like I was some sort of food terrorist, but brought it to me anyway.

Dear god - this pork hok thing? Its pretty much the size of my head. Delicious, fatty, slow roasted pork the size of my head.

Suffice to say, I had to take it home it was so big. Not that my hubby minded since he ate my left overs by the time I came down from bed the next morning. Did I already say he was a jerk?"}
{"text":"Located on Advance road, I must've driven by it a million times. Very unassuming from the front, there is actually a good-sized hidden patio. Inside a million trees have died for the wall-to-wall wooden plank decor.

I had the smoked Pork with the most delicious sauerkraut I've ever had. It came with two huge Pork chops (I took one home for lunch the next day!) My brother had the schnitzel and we both had German beers in a nice \"Cheers\" style mug.

We've been raving about the food - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my family for lunch.  My brother in law is German and this place is around the corner from them so why not try out his cuisine right?

Well this place was rammed for lunch which means one thing to me...you are doing it right.

Service was awesome and friendly and the food...WOW portions were so big that the meal i got, which was the BBQ Pork Hox, was a two mealer for me.

Speaking of the Pork Hox this thing was heavenly.  The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy and tender.  The sides of potato and sauerkraut were on point too.

If you are in the area go here....thank me later for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Germans know how to party. I came with with a rather large group of friends on Octoberfest for dinner and a night of heavy drinking. I felt like I was in Germany at this place. They have 1L mugs of beer and you can even order boots that held about 2L. 

The food itself was quite good. I had the Wiener schnitzel and it was excellent, the side of potatoes were average. Try their \"that mustard sauce\". It's got the perfect amount of kick to it. 

They had a band playing that night, made up some older folks who knew how to get the crowd going. They played German music and would lead German drinking chants. We didn't exactly know what was going on, but by the end of the night got the gist of it - DRINK. The place was filled with people who were easily 70 years old, but they were still up on the dance floor feeling like they were 20 again. The environment of this place is what makes it so amazing. Everyone was dancing, singing and drinking (a lot of drinking). 

The waitress we had was perfect. She embraced our rowdiness and even had a couple of drinks with us. To be fair, the whole place embraced our rowdiness (and even joined us), so they all deserve an applause. 

This place may not seem like the greatest, given its location (surrounded by auto collision centres), but it's definitely an amazing time. All of us will be back very soon and definitely will never spend another Octoberfest anywhere else."}
{"text":"Love the place! I just wish they stocked Erdinger beer!! Service is good! Love the patio!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the unique setting and experience, it was awful (crowd) on Halloween (loud/obnoxious), otherwise an interesting spot.  Pricey.  Enjoyed it but not enough to return (food decent, not great)."}
{"text":"This place has been shut down 3 times in the past 1.5 years due to failing inspections for rodents/insect infestation. Seems like they only cleaning every time they get a yellow or a red from inspections."}
{"text":"You won't like it. It's in the middle of nowhere, has some weird regulars, and has an old school look.

The food is great, though. We had the meat platter, I enjoyed all of it. But the schnitzel and potato salad (they let us swap out the homefries, which was a good call) stood out. The pea soup was by far the best soup I've ever had. I hope to try the pork hocks next.

Skip the dessert."}

Temperature of Food: 5/5 - Served always warm

Value of Meals: 3/5 - Prices are a bit pricey but worth something to try.

Atmosphere: Very old style, to represent the traditional German meals... Clean and very friendly service.

{"text":"The place can be a little intimidating from the outside but the inside is nice and more important, the food is great! The german beer selection is OK and the service is also good. This is not the place for high maintenance girls!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant. I really did.  But as soon as I walked in to pick up my takeout order, I was almost yelled at by a drunk sitting at the end of the bar -whom I believe to be owner - and later stumbled off into the kitchen.

Lets get to the food. We ordered a cordon bleu, a chicken schniztel and a goulash.

The first item was absolutely horrid (minus the cheese which was delicous). They obviously used a very cheap cut of meat and it was as hard as a shoe. I've never had pork that was so tough in my life. I couldn't eat more than a few bites.  If it hadn't been take out I would have no question sent it back which I've probably done 2 or 3 times in my life. It was also 20 bucks (despite the fact that pork is so cheap) so I really felt ripped off.

The second item the chicken schnitzel was pretty good, but the schnitzel at schnitzel queen on queen street is much better still, bigger, tastier and cheaper.

Finally the goulash was ok, but not great and definitely under salted. I sense a cook who does not taste his own food... or maybe it was that rude drunken guy doing the cooking that day.

I wish I had eaten there with my family so I could have embarrassed them about this miserable attempt at cuisine."}
{"text":"My 39th birthday dinner, and our first visit. Great atmosphere. We sat by the fire, so it's private and romantic. Big crowds, so it is a good place to eat. We tried Jaeger Schnitzel and Roulade - excellent by the way. Great service from Maria - Thank you! German-Austrian cuisine. Enjoy kids."}
{"text":"As good as the other review say, so I'll just get right to the point: get the pork hox.  Crispy skin, moist meat and well flavoured.

Quite a trek from downtown but worth it.  You know it's good because it's in the middle of the random industrial park in the middle of nowhere.  And for some odd reason, the parking lot was full of 5-Series BMWs and Porsches.  Not relevant to anything but just odd.

The portions are big here, so it best to go in a group so you can sample everything.  I had a bit of everything and the pork hox was the stand-out.  If I was eating alone here, I would happily order the pork hox and chomp away at it for about an hour.  Loneliness and pork hox are a dangerous mix."}
{"text":"So we saw an episode of \"You Gotta Eat Here\" and they showcased \"The Musket\".

Being schnitzel lovers -- we had to head on over at the first opportunity.

Easy enough to get to, good parking too (not too accessible unless you have wheels to get there though).

I had the Jager Schnitzel and hubby had the Weiner schnitzel.
Both very yummy.  Probably would recommend the Weiner Schnitzel if you are a little more hungry.  Quite a large portion!  
Came with home fries and either red cabbage or veg.

Friendly service and quite reasonable too.
They have an outside (covered) patio for the nice weather.
Strudel as a finish was a-ok!

So, head on over and check out the Musket!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Musket a few times in the past, but I'd never tried their Bratwurst so I figured a return visit was required.

The service is extremely slow, and that has never changed. I feel like there's only one chef in the kitchen because how else do you explain waiting more than half an hour for two exceedingly simple dishes?

(I should also note we had to switch tables due to a rather horrifyingly large insect that was scuttling along the back of several chairs.)

Anyway, the food. The Bratwurst was absolutely delicious, while the accompanying sauerkraut was among the very best I've ever had. The home fries weren't quite as successful, as they merely tasted like cooked, unseasoned potatoes."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant located on an industrial street in south Etobicoke.  I went here with a group of colleagues for lunch a couple of weeks ago. The food and service was exceptionally good.  I'm by no means a schnitzel connoisseur but this was the best I've ever eaten in my life.  It was seasoned well, hot, crispy but surprisingly not greasy.  The portions were huge; everyone needed to be rolled out of there.  Prices were decent and the service was very, very friendly.  

Parking was a bit of a challenge; I think it was behind the restaurant but I don't recall any signs.  Anyway, we all just parked at the bakery and walked over.

I would definitely return in the near future!"}
{"text":"I visited this place after the TV episode of \"You Got to Eat Here\". I will try to be very objective:
\"Hacker\" beer is way below average in taste
I waited 40 minutes to get a seat, AND 80 MINUTES TO GET A MEAL, No exaggeration, at one point the 16 tables on the floor were expecting their food and no single dish coming out of the kitchen, that's not acceptable on a Saturday night between 6-8.
Staff is neutral lean towards \"I don't care\"
The star dish is the pork Hox ($20) (Haxe in German) though good size but the flavor is lacking. served with 6 cubes of potatoes! and Sauerkraut. My wife and son got the meat meal for two, mix of everything, huge meat portions but no veggies ($45) one of the sausage has a unique flavor and the smoked pork chops was good, stake was mediocre, schnitzel was lacking flavor but looks huge.

I ordered as well something called Goulash soup, half full small bowl without a cracker for $7.5 just a stew with 1 cube of beef and 3 cubes of over cooked veggies.

Live music was very good

Worth to try? yes....go again? Maybe"}
{"text":"Came with my 2 friends on a Thursday night. Restaurant was 70% full. The atmosphere is very classic and old looking. Takes me back to the 1980s restaurant feel.

Among the 3 of us we shared a stuffed mushroom caps, jaeger schnitzel, and the famous BBQ pork hox.

Stuff mushroom caps were great, came out steaming hot with lots of flavour. 
The schnitzel was a disappointment. It was barely warm, and the texture was kinda dry.

On to the famous BBQ hox. I would say it's worth a try. The skin is very crunchy and the meat fell right of the bones. But it was a tad bit dry for my liking. Eating this once every 3 years would satisfy my craving.

The server was very nice and attentive. She brought us bread and butter and warm water with lemon.

All in all, due to location and temperature of the food I will only give 3 stars. But definitely worth a try. Oh and the BBQ hox is pretty big. It can be shared with 2 ppl and an appetizer would be enough. Note: only if you aren't huge meat eaters."}
{"text":"it's cute and very authentic looking. first impression was impressive. downhill from there. the waitress who claims she has been there for over ten years, seemed overwhelmed. that's fine. food took over 50 minutes to get to us after we ordered. we have a feeling she forgot to punch our order in. fine. that can happen too. but no apology, no acceptance of responsibility, nothing. food was bland, my pepper steak was way over cooked and the veggies were mush. it was our first and last time unfortunately. we love to support local run restaurants but definitely not this one."}
{"text":"Totally worth the drive to a fairly random Commerical road in Etobicoke. After eating an extremely mediocre plate of schnitzel at near-by Izba a few months prior, I was on the hunt to quell my craving and followed my co-worker's glowing recommendation. 

The exterior of the spot is underwhelming, but don't let that fool you. The inside looks like a mix between your Slavic Uncle's 70's cottage and a Swiss chalet, complete with a dancefloor, should you choose to imbibe in some polka dancing after your meal (note: not sure the live polka band plays every weekend, but they play some serious tunes over the PA regardless). The portions are huge here, so don't fill up on the very-tempting rye bread they bring to the table.  My boyfriend and I ordered a custom mix of the Weiner Schnitzel (re: breaded, the way to go) which also came with the traditional red cabbage slaw, and the Jager Schnitzel, which came with a mushroom gravy sauce that we couldn't pass up. They also had a pretty great selection of German beers. Apparently you can also order a Fred Flintstone-sized leg of some long-extinct animal, which appeared to be popular with the locals."}
{"text":"What a great place for German food; a bit out of the way but it was worth the trip.  I went with a part of four and we tried a slew of things.

Ordered the hit list (as you can see from the pictures from Yelp):
1) Stuffed Mushroom Caps - very good with the crab meat; but I think they shrunk as they were small than the pictures taken by other members

2) Meat platter for two - best dish!! An assortment of meat and all very good!! If people in your party aren't big eaters (that like to stuff their face) this platter was good enough for 4 of us.

3) Pork Hox ... this masive knuckle was also shared amongst the 4 of us..it's a good side for 2 people. Very crispy outside!

It was recommend from a friend of a friend who's German.. the recommendation is true.  Come here for great authentic German food!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the rave was all about. It was just average to me. Perhaps it was a sunday evening but we were told a few times they did not have certain sausages etc. No loss there as I did not particularly like the sausage/pork anyway though lots of ppl at the table liked it. 

Our group loved the German beers. It was in a huge mug and well worth the price. 

I ordered the schnitzel. It was tasty but def. nothing that special.It also came with steamed veggies (a bit salty) and home fries. Arteries probably clogged a little more after the home fries. Portions were huge. Definitely had to pack it up for the next day. Maybe if I were a huge carnivore I would like it here :)

Parking - available at the back and front. i sure hope we don't have to come back anymore... It was alright but the drive was a bitch because 401 was stuck even on a sunday!"}
{"text":"Meat meat and meat in all it's glory. What a fun place to eat and be merry!"}
{"text":"Musket, what happened to you?
This used to be our favourite neighbourhood restaurant. We've come here too many times to count. We've brought friends and family and made them fall in love with you. 
And yet here we're, leaving 30 minutes into our meal. First service was disastrous to say the least. Our server took our drink order and got one of the beers wrong. We let  it go and didn't say anything  but then we overhead the same waitress tell another patron they were out of the beer we asked for. 
20 minutes later and she still hadn't ask for our food order, I had to flag her down.  Our food arrived before the complementary bread basket, plates, or utensils. The waitress made a comment and returned promptly to set the table.  10 minutes into the meal we asked for another round of draft and the waitress didn't say anything but returned with 2 unopened cans of beer. Didn't even explain why the switch,  just dumped them on the table. We told her we only wanted draft beer and she got defensive, said they had no more draft.  She didn't explain or politely apologize she just said \"what do you want me to do?\"
At this point we had enough and asked for take out containers and packed our meal. 
The waitress was rude to the very end when she threw the cheque on top of the bread. In spite of everything, my husband still left a tip because he felt obligated to but I wouldn't have bothered. 

It's safe to say that we will never be back which is sad because we loved the food, the beer, and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Musket's location may be quite off, but once you get inside it's a charming little pub where you can have a couple of drinks and carry on a good conversation. The lighting is cozy and the crowd, mature and pleasant. Service is warm and welcoming. We got the meat platter for two which turned out to be a LOT, but I didn't find anything spectacular in the schnitzels, sausages, and slabs of beef. I wouldn't really know if my opinion is correct since I have little knowledge on German fare, but this much I could say: I would come back to The Musket because I like the place and service. Also, I really want to try the famous pork hox."}
{"text":"Bbq pork hox is the best in town!! And I don't know where else in town serve it this way.  Crunchy outside, smoky and soft inside. Two thumbs up, I keep coming back for the delicious pork hox, what else can I say?  

Service is warm and nice, place is cozy.  Price is not expensive at all, may be because of the location.  If you drive it's still easy to come here."}
{"text":"The Musket is a meat lovers dream come true!

Located in a non-descript industrial park, I thought we were there to pick up discounted carpet samples rather than getting ready to chow down on some good eatin'.

We made reservations for a Friday night and I'm glad we did because when we arrived a bit late, they had already given away our table.  The hostess was able to shift some tables around to find us a seat.

We started off with a few pints of Hacker beer ($7) and then ordered food.  I had to go with Pork Hox ($21.25).  We also ordred the Meat Platter for Two ($45.95), the Cordon Blue ($18.95) and the Schnitzle  ($18.95).  It was a bit of meat overkill but we were super hungry.

Once our food arrived, we dug in.  The pork hox is as good as everyone describes - crispy skin on the outside, tender moist meat on the inside.  Amazing!  The meat platter did not dissapoint with its array of sausages, steak and ham.  We did have to doggy bag the leftovers, which made for a meat-alicious lunch the next day.

Decor is what I would describe as festive German chalet chic.  Cozy and inviting with the promise of hearty and delicious food.  I am won over."}
{"text":"This place is in an industrial area - the decor is charming. They have an outdoor bar with patio seating. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Food was really good . My favourite was the stuffed mushrooms. I had the sea bass - it was flavourful."}
{"text":"I finally made it to The Musket for lunch today.  The plain schnitzel was delicious.  My friend had the ribs which were also awesome.  The decor is quirky and fun if not a little tired.  Service was a little slow but hey its the last day before Christmas. Everyone had a great time until it was time for the bill.  When the bill arrived I noticed the waitress had added an extra item ($8).  When I brought it up she began to correct the totals by hand and said the Manager was out and she could not print the correct bill. After much frowning somehow she was able to produce a corrected bill.  This experience was a real turn off."}
{"text":"Solid german food. Love the jager schnitzel - that mushroom sauce is to die for. 

Good German beers too. 

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The Musket is a restaurant I would probably frequent at least once a week if we weren't so geographically separated!
Everything about this place screams authentic: you walk into a wood panelled room where you are greeted by a heavily moustached German gent! As you walk in, you take a look at the walls and note the hanging muskets and authentic bild auf holz*. If you're there towards the weekend, you might find an accordion being played in the corner, as well as a group of old school German men playing cards and drinking beer at the large central table. Most importantly, Hacker Pschorr is served on tap, and it is both appreciated and bragged about by those who serve it! 

From the menu, the BBQ Pork Hox receives the highest recommendation and deserves special recognition! This is an authentic dish that is cooked perfectly at the Musket; it is tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. For this dish, I would suggest substituting the side of sauerkraut for blaukraut as I feel they do a better job with the latter**. The homestyle fries are also a great side that accompanies most plates, and of course every table is served with a basket of fresh bread from Dimpflmeier's which happens to be down the street! 
The next winner in the food category is the schnitzel, which I enjoy served with their fantastic creamy mushroom sauce! 
As a small rant, I find the soups to be a bit too salty. That being said, I remember from my days in Wiesbaden that from time to time I would find it hard to finish the food in restaurants because of its saltiness. At the same time, my German friends in Canada claimed they found the food here 'tasteless' so maybe it's a cultural thing. Aside from the soup rant, the service while usually great is not 100% consistent, and can vary based on the night you visit.

Long story short, even if you are not drawn by the authentic and meat heavy dishes, the Hacker, large bar area, and appetizers are likely to put a smile on your face!

{"text":"A hidden gem! The classic schnitzel is amazing."}
{"text":"Live music. Great food, good prices. A Real hidden gem I would recommend this place for German food anytime. Service was ok, nice waitress."}
{"text":"Went there after reading the reviews. My proud German friend was visiting from out of town, thought this was right up his alley. As soon as we walked in, he said the smell brought him back to grandma's house on Christmas Day!  We had the meat combo for two, overall quite good, the only thing that threw us off was the steak? Didn't really belong, overcooked and wasn't the greatest quality. Also, they have a nice selection of German beers on tap."}
{"text":"What. An. Experience.

My family (Cantonese Chinese) came here for our Christmas dinner - twice! And we loved it! So lively, fun and deliciously filling.

ATMOSPHERE: It was so much fun. As mentioned, we were there during the holidays so the place. The first time we were here, it was the week before Christmas, so it was PACKED. Could not move an inch. So if you're claustrophobic - be sure to either avoid near the holidays... otherwise, the restaurant is quite large and great for groups. 

The vibe is very rustic. Wood everywhere. It's like you walked into a Swiss-German chalet that turned out to be a pretty awesome pub restaurant.

They have regulars there who are part of German clubs and so almost some live musical entertainment will ensue!

SERVICE: Very friendly, helpful and prompt. Even on such a busy occasion, they were attentive to our table of 7.

PRICE: Very reasonable, especially when sharing food with a large party. The portions are HUGE, so be weary of over-ordering - unless you mean to take leftovers for the rest of the week. (And incredibly tasty leftovers that would be.)

FOOD: Wow. Portion control - what's that? So much meat. No wonder a nearby German gent said to us: \"Y'know what German's favourite vegetable is? MEAT.\" Haha, we tried to eat as much of the (yummy) sauerkraut as we could to balance the meat.

Between 7 people we ordered lots to try - because it was our first visit:

Dessert was not impressive though. Got 2 slices of cake: chocolate and hazelut - but they were pretty standard.


Overall this place is quite a blast - on all fronts. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not enough food. I spent $25 for maybe 2 pieces of ham. Enjoyed the beer though. I would never go there on my own except when there is a retirement party or something."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant for two times. First time we had lunch there, which was a great experience - delicious food, good service and reasonable price. So we decide to go there for dinner last night. Food still good but service was pretty bad this time. We waited for more than an hour to get our appetizers - garlic bread and smoke salmon. The server was very cold to us as if we are not welcomed. We were quite disappointed at this time."}
{"text":"Authentic German food like your Oma used to make?  Look no further, for The Musket shall satisfy your meat/ NO VEG cravings!

Specifically we had the meat platter for 2 and we couldn't begin to finish it (there were 3 of us)  2 types of sausage, steak, smoked pork chops, schnitzel, with sauerkraut, pickled cabbage and potatoes (those were considered the veg, hah)  Many species on one plate!  Being top of the food chain is fun!

The food was top shelf, and I look forward to going back to try other dishes.

We went on a Saturday for lunch, and let me tell you the beer was flowing for the regulars.  I also want to say the owner and his brother are amazing, friendly guys.

D

p.s,. Pro Tip- try their yellow mustard.  Serious kick, I bought a jar to take home."}
