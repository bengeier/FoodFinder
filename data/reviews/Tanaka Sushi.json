{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!! If there was a minus 5 star I would have put that. Seriously they are gypsies here...you order sushi for take out.... They send you with some panko filled rice and drizzle oyster sauce to make it look like eel roll. Warning they use the WORST quality fish too!"}
{"text":"????  sushi all-you-can-eat, fountain soda included"}
{"text":"**0.5 Stars** HOLY!!! This place is GARBAGE!!! So a new japanese all you can eat opened, so I gave it a try. Theres a wide variety of japanese dishes on the menu, but guess what?!?! They all suck!! Nothing is worth mentioning. Even the pop is some crappy old flat president's choice pop. The salmon sashimi seems like it has been sitting there for a week and is darkening.  Food is just terrible quality. But worst of all the SERVICE! The lady was slow, rude and grumpy. We had 3 pieces of salmon left and she told us we're wasting food and wouldn't serve us ice cream til we finished. Dude WTFFF!!?!?  theres a reason why we can't finish the food! ITS GARBAGE!!  If I can curse about this place, I would, but unfortunately Yelp won't allow it.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The seafood and vegetarian rolls are very fresh! I loved it there."}
{"text":"Food turnover slow They usually serve defrosted fish I've been hoping this place would step it up but nothing changes Plates were dirty, could not wipe off with napkin because it was left over grease Server talks bad about customers right in front of their face with owner No respect for people Tea was just warm I don't think they boil it properly could be hot water from the faucet Won't go back lost my appetite"}
{"text":"Great place, love the food, and the service is A1, the owner is such a nice person. Am a regular their."}
{"text":"Good service with a smile, which is very unusual for an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant. As for the food. It is average but the service makes up for it. Salmon sushi has a slice of salmon so thin it is almost transparent. Their fish is great, and so are their teriaki meats. I am a regular due to the close proximity to my home. And will be back."}
{"text":"Horrible place for sushi and sashimi ...it says \"all you can eat\" basically you gonna get half of whatever you order! And if u mentioned they will cut the sushi and sashimi; literally into microscopic  pieces, when I mentioned to the lady she said we dont count the orders and she was RUDE ...Last time ever !"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years.This place has amazing service, prices and menu for both all you can eat sushi as well as take out. Their lunch menu offers great options that most places will only offer for dinner. The man serving me and my sister went above and beyond when accommodating changes on the menu. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good service from the owner. However, it suppose to be tax free if you pay in cash. And the server didn't give my changes back while the bill has included tips. That's why I give a star off. Food here is quite good if you don't order sashimi."}
{"text":"Our Canadian friends recommended and brought us to this place several days ago.  It was tuck in the side of a small plaza.  Although, I am a novice in Japanese food, I did like the selections that our Canadian friends selected for us.  They were friendly and tried to understand our difference in language and intonation.  I have tried some Japanese buffet before but did not like it.  So far, we enjoyed and liked their food except for the Hokkaido milk flan desert.  I also could not understand why they have frozen banana as well as fresh banana in their banana split dessert.  Their sushis and sashimis were good for an all you can eat Japanese restaurant.  I did not like the additional charge for using a credit card so our friends paid in cash instead."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant to us, so we came here for dinner.  They don't have many choice of sashimi, no options for tempura. Decent sushi and maki. There's many soup and dishes like surf clams and scallops. Cold tofu is literally tofu with sauce in a bowl with ice, there weren't even garnish. To me this is one of those since I am nearby and I am hungry I will just eat here kinda restaurant.  However the staff here are very friendly, great service. I would love to come back if the food here is improved."}
{"text":"For years I've been driving on the streets of Richmond Hill, passing numerous conspicuous and inconspicuous plazas with local businesses that lures absolutely nobody. I don't live in the area afterall, but I wanted to know what the people who did live here ate. So I set off with my friend Chris on 16th Avenue, and picked the first place we saw. We saw Tanaka.  Well, actually we saw \"all you can eat sushi\" and a crowd of people outside, so naturally we made a U turn into the plaza, passing two chicks at a corner. One was standing upright in a shopping cart, the other one pushing her in broad daylight. We exchanged glances, and there was a moment of silence.  We entered the restaurant and was immediately greeted and sat by the waitresses. The place was as green. Green Lantern green. Like, anything that could have been green was green. The chairs were lime green, and showed of ageing vinyl. There were two television screens showings sports. At a sushi restaurant? There was a big lit menu on at the entrance pricing individual dishes, so it was confusing. But after confirming it was an all you can eat, we began ordering. (1hr 30min ordering window) Now, I have always used the phrase \"strike fear into the hearts of buffets\" to describe my eating habits. But at Tanaka, I actually did it. The look of astonishment reflected rather candidly on the face of the head waitress after our initial order. There were no pads to write our orders on, so I used my blackberry to list everything I wanted. When she realized I was ordering off of my phone, she reciprocated with a very awkward: \"oh..\"  Nothing is very well made here. There are no outstanding dishes to be mentioned, and although the selection wasn't in the plethora, they did have shark fin sushi. I don't know if it was real.   When she came around after we were finished our first batch, our waitress asked whether we wanted to order again, but only out of courtesy. So when we said yes, she just looked at us with a blank expression for about two seconds. I started ordering, the list went on, and when I was done, she read my order back to me ensuring she wasn't missing anything. However, she had this look on her face that was unmistakable. I know that face, and although she had doubt whether we'd be able to finish ($1.00 per every piece that's left over), and acted as if she was checking our orders, I knew what she was actually doing. That face ONLY occurs when a Chinese person is doing math..!! She was calculating how much we exceeded our quota for Money vs. Fish. That's the risk you run by opening an all you can sushi restaurant. And I am the greatest threat to that industry!  I could hear cursing coming from the kitchen, sheer disbelief that they were making all this food for only two people. I was forcing Chris to finish what I couldn't. I never seen anyone so pissed for being forced to eat. But I reminded him that we were both patrons of Foie Gras, and the goose had to go through a lot worse. I'm not sure how that applied here, since nobody was extracting our livers.  Since I ordered on my blackberry, I actually have the list available. HA! -Shark fin sushi 1 piece -Green dragon roll 6 pieces -White tuna sashimi 18 pieces -Shrimp Tempura 8 pieces -Deep fried scallop 6 pieces -Baked mussels with garlic butter 6 pieces -Salmon Sashimi 6 pieces -Baked escargots 6 pieces -Red dragon roll 6 pieces -Salmon belly 2 pieces -Bacon asparigas roll 2 pieces -Deep fried chicken 8 pieces -Scallop roll 6 pieces -Deep fried tofu 2 pieces  -Spicy salmon crispy roll 18 pieces  Yeah. Appetites of mass destruction! AMD....Althon!  ahahaha...I couldn't resist!  Oh yes, you know those green plastic leaf pieces of garnish they put on sushi plates? They had those with arrows pointing which way to place upright....what's with that?  We were lucky the chefs didn't come out and slaughter us and place us on the menu. $20+ per person? RUN FOR IT!"}
{"text":"Fresh Fish, Great Price and Nice staff   We love Tanaka sushi and for myself and my family is an institution and we must go at least once or twice a month!  The sushi is always fresh, the  portions are generous and for the quality and price, you can not beat this place.  It is a family run business and every time we go we are greeted by the staff who are always very nice and extra attentive to my wife's food allergies.   Some of our favourites are: Salmon and Tuna Sashimi, Crispy Salmon roll and hand roll, green and red dragon roll, rose roll, dynamite roll. in the non sushi/fish category their lamb and beef fillet are top notch, but also try their tempura shrimp and veggies as well as the dumplings.   Overall, we have never left this place unhappy and I definitely recommend it to anyone for lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"Price is advertised at $19.95 on weekdays and 2dollars more on weekends. I went on a Saturday. Price should be $21.95. On the site ccue.com, they advertised that there is another 15% off. Main reason why I went there, was because of how cheap the price was. When I paid for the bill, they didnt discount 15% off but only 10%. On top of that, they charged me 12% service fee on a table for 2. Not only that, everytime I order, they only bring half of what I ordered. For example, I order 20 pieces of sashimi, I get 10 pieces only. Would definitely not recommend at all!"}
{"text":"What can I say,, another all you can eat sushi restaurant. I really feel like the fad at these places are over.  All you can eat usually are pretty sub par quality food. But this place is at a different level.  First off the location is not the best. Located in the. Corner of a tiny unlit plaza.  So expectations weren't high to begin with, being an all you can eat sushi. But the food here is not even passable to be put in your mouth. The salmon sashimi had an extremely fishy taste, like it has been sitting under the sun all day.  We didn't finish everything because it really wasn't all that good. Worst part is they ended up charging us an additional 5$ each!"}
{"text":"This is a decent all you can eat place that has most options available at other AYCE restaurants.  It's owned my a friendly couple and service is pretty decent considering how busy they are sometimes.  They take cards and cash, but if you pay cash you can save on the taxes.   The food is alright and they do have various rolls and assorted sashimi.  The cooked food is also decent with some options for those not into raw fish.  The sashimi is pretty fresh, but the slices are mega thin.  You can almost see through them!  Overall a decent place for the price.  $20 gets you a vast selection of sushi, sashimi and cooked food, you can't really go wrong with that.  I would come back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered à la cart and some ham and rolls through just eat. Service and delivery was great. Some of the sushi was less than desirable mainly because the salmon what chewy and not tasty,  some of the white fish had discoloration. Overall the non-fish rolls were quite good. You get a tremendous amount of food for the dollar and would suggest this place for parties and get-togethers but would not recommend any salmon."}
{"text":"FYI this place used to be called Nagoya. It was also a Japanese restaurant at that time. I never tried it though.  Anyways, I dropped by during a Sunday night for dinner. The place was fairly quiet, a few tables occupied, but then this big birthday party arrived. It didn't affect my experience there much, but it did leave me to wonder whether they would have been adequately staffed to handle the restaurant had it been full. In any case, the service was pleasant, courteous, and actually fairly thoughtful as far as Chinese-run AYCE Japanese restaurants go. It's pretty much a mom and pop shop -- something I always enjoy seeing and compels me to wish them the best of success in their endeavour.  But to be honest, the quality of food is pretty average. The sashimi was mediocre unfortunately -- we did not get the same quality fish that was shown in some of the photos by other reviewers. It seems like the fish is kind of hit or miss depending on the shipment that they get in. I also found the edamame to be overcooked and a touch soggy. The grilled and cooked food however was enjoyed by everyone at my table, namely the grilled fishes, spareribs, steaks, and so on. Note that the grilled/cooked stuff tend to follow after a more Chinese-inspired flavour profile. Let's face it though, you're not really coming to a AYCE sushi restaurant really expecting authentic Japanese food, are you?  The sushi was quite good in terms of the ratio of filling to rice. I personally found their sushi rice to be a little bit too moist for my liking. They had a very interesting yam tempura + avocado brown rice roll (well to be more correct, it's actually \"red rice\" that they use). This is something that I'd never seen before, so kudos to them for trying something new. I guess that experimentation has led to their massive menu; these guys have more options than any other AYCE restaurant I've been to.  Dessert options included the usual assortment of ice creams (they apparently sometimes have some unique flavours like black sesame, coconut, etc., which is nice). There was a milk pudding, basically a flan, that I enjoyed. One of the seemingly unique options was a banana pancake with ice cream. This turned out to be a bit of a bust though; it was just ice cream and half a banana wrapped in a thin crepe, topped with some whipped cream.   Overall, it was an OK experience here. Nothing stellar, but good enough that I would consider coming back (but this is admittedly moreso because there is a real lack of decent AYCE options in this area now)."}
{"text":"I feel like I must write a review to defend this restaurant. I was hesitant to come here due to all the negative reviews, but because my friend invited me and she said the food is really good, I thought I should at least hear her out.   This is my conclusion: stay clear of the sashimi, and dig into the grilled foods!   Perhaps their bad rep on Yelp is hurting their business. When we went on a week night during dinner time, there were only 2 other tables. The rest of the restaurant was empty. Maybe the location also had something to do with it.   My friend's been here before so she starts writing down a bunch of orders. Hmm I'm not sure if she brought her own pad of paper but she started jotting down a lot of stuff. I sure hoped we could finish all that food. I'm not sure I'm hungry enough to have AYCE.....  but you know what? Once I started digging into the food, my appetite spontaneously came. Especially after the Diced Steak with Garlic. Garlic is a sure appetite opener!   Here's how the food stacked up:  Grilled Eggplant - Pretty bland but my friend loved it  Chicken Fillet - tasty  Diced Steak with Garlic - super  Baked Mushrooms with Butter - MUST TRY***** Man this is so good!   Black Dragon Roll (eel on top) - delicious  Yam and Avocado Roll with Brown Rice - something different and I loved it so much we ordered two  Grilled Saury Fish - I'm not huge on grilled fish but my friend loved it.   Deep Fried Chicken and Skewered Curry Chicken - good  Tempura - average  Edamame - overcooked  Short Ribs with Black Pepper Sauce - delicious  Green Salad - watery  Salmon and White Tuna Sashimi - I love sashimi but theirs is \"meh\". I don't agree with the other reviews that it is super tiny. It's more like average sized. But it doesn't taste the freshest and it looks kind of sad.   Salmon Sushi - So so. Seriously I like the sushi from T&T more.   $19 for dinner (cash price)  I hope that provided you with a road map for how to do AYCE at Tanaka Sushi. If anything, the Baked Mushroom with Butter is addictive and sure to steal some hearts! If you like grilled foods, and if you like variety, you should check this place out. They had a lot of other hot foods that I didn't get to try such as the steamed egg. I think I'll have to come back to try the other half of the menu another time ^_^"}
{"text":"Came here for their lunch special. Menu was decent. Was recommended the sushi sampler special. Sushi and portions were alright, nothing special, can't complain for 5.99. We also ordered a Teriyaki Salmon rice (6.99). Serving plate was kinda worn and dirty though. Food tasted okay. Nothing that wowed me. Customer service was exceptional though. However, if you come with only two people, they place you in a dirty dingy small corner. The place was rather dirty in general and dark but if you want a quick bite and average prices for Japanese dine in in the Richmond Hill area, this is not a bad option I guess. However, would not return because there are many other options in that area and there's a plaza one block away."}
{"text":"First time dining at this restaurant since its in the neighbourhood. It's about $22 per adult (weekday) and free for kids under 3. When I asked the lady if kids under 3 are free to confirm - she looked at my daughter and gave me a look and said yes. I just didn't feel so welcomed at this place. First impression I felt off... Thanks to this lady. My daughter is 21 months and tall! I felt like I had to show her my daughters ID!!! Plain rude. Anyways, she kept coming around asking what I wanted to order, we haven't even looked at the menu, she made us feel rushed. I did not enjoy the customer service. If they are a family run business I just would assume they would be more friendly and more family friendly. Not really. I felt like the lady was eyeing down at our table- checking to see if we are finishing our food... I personally would not go back due to their customer service. Ps at the bottom of the menu it says they charge a 10% service charge BUT they charged 12% on the bill.... Hmm not right. The food was okay, the seaweed salad seemed like it was frozen then defrosted. Uber ice cold and watery. Miso soup was flavourless. Chicken teriyaki was thinly sliced not thick like they show on the picture. Anyway, we won't be going back and I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
