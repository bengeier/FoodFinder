{"text":"A disaster - This restaurant is running down and it needs a refurbishment. Walls and even their chairs are rotted. We ordered a spicy shrimp, but the meat was not fresh at all. I just regret bringing my family here and for sure we won't visit again."}
{"text":"I had the dry noodles with pork.  I barely got any pork, it was just a few thin slices of pork and not that tasty either.  And the sauce you could tell had way too much cornstarch...it was all gooey.....not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Parking is a bit hard to find, but if you're here for take-out or walk-in than it'll be perfect. I prefer the garlic explosion noodles as I like garlic in general. For the price of $8.00 large I find it was quite filling for me. As others have mentioned its best to eat it right away as the noodles are dry like \"lo mein\"."}
{"text":"Hard to find parking, parking inside the circle costs $1 per 15 mins. 

It is a small store with few stools.  

The noodle itself was soft & you did not really need to chew it if u like soft smooth texture.  
We tried so sesame & garlic explosion; the lady was so nice & recommended us to add a bit of their house special spicy/hot sauce.  
A bit was quite spicy for my friend, so for those whole love spicy/hot, should try.  

The so sesame was good, not too salty; I was able to taste the creamy peanut / sesame sauce.  
Garlic explosion of cause garlic-y.  
They have fresh young coconut water ... Yum & refreshing.  

The small size was good portion for lunch."}
{"text":"A little noodle place in North York, definitely a hidden gem! I brought my mom here because there were no parking for the other places we wanted to try.. But coming here was the best decision we've made! 

My mom tried the classic and I tried the funky spicy. They tasted different but both tasted very good. The noodle is tender and the sauce is yummy! I'm not a huge fan of very spicy food, but the funky spicy did justice, we ate our noodles till the bottom of our bowls! 

Amy, the owner is super nice and friendly. Overall, it was a lovely place to eat hot hainan noodle during the chilly winter! Definitely will come back! :)"}
{"text":"Really like their noodles - especially the so sesame chicken flavour! I've also tried their hainan chicken rice and that was really good too!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!!!! The noodles are so flavourful without being too salty or heavy. Amy, the owner, is so lovely and helpful. 

My husband and I tried the Classic and the Garlic Explosion, and both were amazing. We also ordered the Sriracha fried chicken, and those were excellent as well. Just the perfect amount of seasoning and flavouring. 

We are looking forward to our next visit to try the other two types of noodles!!! 

It is a very small place though so going in small numbers is best!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Try the classic noodles, it won't disappoint. The menu is limited, but the taste is there.  
Traditional Chinese noodles, unlike anything I have tried, with generous portions.
The owner is often the one serving you and she is really friendly.
This is mainly a pick-up place, although there are a few seats at the counter.
If you go in the summer, it is not uncommon to see trust babies from Asia flaunting their Ferrari's and Lamborghinis."}
{"text":"3 words can describe it. Not worth it. The price, the food quality , and the quantity all 3 of which are bad. This place is advertised as a hainan place. And i expected the same style that i had back when i was in hainan island with the famous hainan chicken rice. I have to say the chicken at this place is a disgrace to hainan chicken. It is by far the worst in this city. The chicken is bland. Without sauce the place tried shoving pickled vegetable to disguise the blandess in flavour. And the rice is just oily but not with the traiditional chicken oil you are supposed to use. The quantity is beyond bad for 9.99 rice box they charge they give you a proportions that is so small you fell like its a sampler. I had to zoom in on photos to make it look bigger. Overall i would say avoid this place. As it is not worth your time money or effort"}
{"text":"Never notice this place till my friend recommend their So Sesame. Tried it, and it taste really good. The only negative is that if you don't eat it right away it's gonna get really dry."}
{"text":"Huh. They're not using their paper cups anymore. They're using plastic bowls now, at least for the small size. The portions look larger than their small paper cup. That's good, right?

My cousin and I came two Sundays ago and we decided that since the smalls don't look too big, we'd get three different flavors to split between the two of us. We got the classic (500 year old classic Hainan noodle with beef), the garlic explosion (fresh chopped garlic and thinly sliced pork belly), and so sesame (sesame dressing, hand-pulled chicken, and roasted sesame). 

In general, the sauces are goopy. I believe they're made to be that way. They really cling to the noodles. I love that texture when it's done intentionally, so it's great! Each noodle dish we had was great in its own way. The classic was safe, but delicious. The garlic explosion is for those who like raw garlic. The pork belly in it was very tender as well. The so sesame is my favorite because I'm a sucker for sesame, and this delivered. So good. The chicken kinda gets lost in the sesame flavor, but I can deal with that. We didn't end up finishing all three noodles. We got through perhaps two and a half. Given that their most expensive small noodle is $6.99 and all of ours were $5.99 and under, this makes for a good cheap eat. 

We also got a few of their in-house specialty drinks. We got a wintermelon tea that tasted like brown sugar, and a fruit punch that was delightfully citrus-y and fruity and slightly fizzy and super refreshing. Those drinks come in ziplock pouches you slide straws into. Grown-up Kool-Aid jammers, if you will. They were so much fun to drink.

There are two or three small tables if you want to eat in, but don't expect any frills. This is a great place for a quick meal though. Next time, I'm trying the funky spicy."}
{"text":"Had the Hainan chicken rice and it is none like the other. I love Hainan chicken rice and has tried this dish in many restaurants. I highly recommend trying this one because it is quite unique. The rice is rich in flavour because is cooked with chicken broth and chicken oil. They added pickled veggies on the side and it goes very well with the rice. The chicken was very flavourful too. I had this for lunch and I was very full after. 
If you have a chance, chat with the owner too. She's from Hainan and loves sharing why she started this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to this place a number a times and loved the Garlic Explosion. 
This time, they had a few new things that we tried. I read online about the Hainan Chicken rice and has to try it. It was pretty darn good. The rice was thoroughly covered in a flavourful broth. The chicken was very moist and had a green chili sauce that was very tasty with a bit of bite.  We ordered two of their new drinks that was alike a ginger mojito soda (would have been nice if it was alcoholic). It was very refreshing but took some time for the lime and mint to come out. We then ordered the Special Dessert which was a similar sweet soup I have tasted in Taiwan. It was a refreshing coconut based cold soup with assorted beans that were not too soft. It was enjoyable.
Loved the old stuff and the new. Too bad there isn't one in Markham."}
{"text":"Hainan chicken with rice is what will come to my mind if thinking of Hainan.  I have never heard or tried Hainan noodle until today.  What's Hainan noodle?  It's rice noodles in thick soup; it's so thick that the soup will cling to every noodle and hang on to my palate.   I have the classic noodle and the coconut dessert.  The classic noodle is noodles with ground beef, bean sprout, pickled vegetable and top with the thick soup.  The coconut dessert is coconut milk with green beans, red dates and white fungus.  Both are delish.  Their menu is small, but who needs a big menu for a place with great food?!   *Make sure to make it spicy and challenge your taste buds*"}
{"text":"Hyped-up!

All noodles, with 2 pieces of pork belly.

They charge $0.50 for paying with a crédit card (not allowed by banks).

Taste-wise, ordinary.

Parking is $1 for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Have you ever tasted something so good, you just had to try recreate the flavours for yourself? Sprout Hainan Noodles rice noodle bowl did that to me. Inspired by Garlic Explosion and Funky Shrimp, I combined my favourite elements from two tasty bowls drenched with gravy to create my own. The key attribute as Amy, the lovely owner will tell you-- Hainan's unique yellow lantern chilli sauce as a tiny topping for a super hot experience!      Slurrrrrrpeliciousness! If interested, see my experience and my take on the noodle bowl: http://susanssavourit.blogspot.ca/2016/01/hainan-style-spicy-shrimp-snack-noodles.html"}
{"text":"This was my first time. 

Even though Yelp only had 9 reviews and a handful of photos, I had to come after seeing that all 9 reviews were giving praise to this petit shop in this plaza. 

My friend and I ordered the Classic (ground beef, $5.49) and Garlic Explosion (sliced pork belly, $5.99). I had the classic and I loved the soup and thick consistency of it all. The bowl was jammed packed with ground beef noodles and veggies. And the flavour was super tasty and not extremely salty. She even added this Orange jelly/purée spice to the dish. But beware that spice (even a finger tip amount) was . My friend got the Garlic explosion and said it was delicious too. I think the only thing I can critique is the softness of the noodles. They were good, round-like-spaghetti, but a little too soft for my taste. Had it been a little harder with some chew to it, it would have made my top 5 noodle places.

If you decide to come, mind you small amount of kiddie bar stools. Luckily no one was there at the time, so we basically had the whole store front to ourselves. 

It's like a cute and tasty hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The elder lady who worked there was very friendly. 

This could be my go-to take out for some tasty Hainan noodles."}
{"text":"The first time I tried the noodles I thought I had found a new takeout place for the days I didn't feel like cooking. The flavour was very nice and the noodles was well done too (not too mushy, not too hard). I have now tried so sesame, classic and garlic explosion and I have enjoyed all of it. 
However I did notice that the quality has deteriorated over the past 3 months. On my very last visit I was quite disappointed, the flavour just wasn't there and it seemed that the quantity was also smaller than the previous times I've had it. I will probably not come back, at least not in the near future."}
{"text":"Hainanese Chicken rice was ok.. it was legit made!!! I also make this dish at home...

Personally, the onions&ginger sauce they used was weird to me...not my cup of tea..

I would give his place the 4 stars - which is a recommend, because the hainanese chicken rice was home-cook style!!"}
{"text":"I was not too impressed when they were just serving the Hainan noodle...guess I just wasn't a big fan of the noodle itself.  Recently I went in when I saw they had added things like Hainan chicken which is always one of my fav and it didn't disappoint...it tastes homemade and delicious.  I have tried their other 3 or 4 homemade dishes and loved them all.  Even the marbled pork which I am usually not a big fan of because of the fatty part.  The food is pre-made and heated on ordering which I am always against.  But I didn't mind it much here as it accentuated the homemade quality.    I guess I am just against bad tasting pre-made food...."}
{"text":"Classics Sprout Noodles ($5.49 for small)
Apparently this is their 500 year Classics Hainan noodles, one of the most popular flavors on their menu. Rice noodles, mixed with sprouts, ground beef, and pickled vegetables in a hearty broth. There were quite a decent amount of ingredients inside, and in terms of portion its quite a lot for a small bowl. Perfect snack! This noodle soup is really flavorful, quite peppery but really tasty.

Definitely would come back to try their other flavors!"}
{"text":"Amy is so nice, and I love the garlic noodles. So unique, and always craving for more."}
{"text":"I found the noodles to be way too soft and their dishes to be bland or salty (to cover the bland-ness)."}
{"text":"Eating noodle from a paper cup sounds like a perfect street food. Sprout Hainan Noodle serves up some excellent rice noodle with the a perfect chewiness which I prefer.

The menu is really simple with just 3 soup base to choose from but all have an unique taste. I would recommend the Funky Spicy if you enjoy spicy food. Love all the toppings, but beware of the preserved vegetables which has a sour funky taste and smell.

The small for $5.99 would be a perfect afternoon snack!"}
