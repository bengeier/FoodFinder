{"text":"Our favorite place so far in Charlotte for Chinese.  Everything tastes fresh, friendly service,  good portions...never had anything that was \"so-so\". Would recommend."}
{"text":"Fast and convenient.  I am a six year customer and I have never been disappointed. The food is great and the staff couldn't be friendlier!  I have never met a harder working couple then the two who run this restaurant morning, noon and night 7 days a week. I agree the interior is less than perfect but the food is so so good."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! DO NOT EAT HERE! DO NOT EAT HERE! I went here to pick up food for my family. Everyone was about halfway through their meals when I noticed something crunchy in my shrimp lo mein. I shuffled the food around with my tongue and found the culprit. When I spit the piece into my hand I couldn't make out what it was. It was a shiny green. The piece was actually shining almost like those flip flop paint cars. I look at it from one angle it's green and another angle it looks purple. That's when I finally realized what it was. It was a freaking beetle head that I bit. I immediately went to throw up and what do you know I see the body in the toilet. I threw up a little more and immediately went to get my money back. No apology or anything when I went up there. I simply received a  refund and the manager/ owner wanted to dispose of the evidence so that no one would know. I took a picture for all to enjoy!"}
{"text":"This Place straight up nasty one of the worse ones around northlake area the fry the general sesame ect chicken too hard broccoli smells as if its spoiled never again"}
{"text":"The interior is very VERY basic, but I absolutely love how quick I get my food. The food may seem expensive, but they give you lots of it. I always have leftovers. ALWAYS. There's never been a time where I didn't. Definitely your money's worth.  Since it's very bland looking inside the restaurant, I would just order it as takeout and not eat there until they improve. They always give you what you order; not once have they messed up any of my orders.   I see great things for this restaurant. I really hope they make the money to improve the interior because it wouldn't be so bad to eat there if they do."}
{"text":"Such good Chinese food. Pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Not bad for your typical, run of the mill take-out Chinese food. Big portions, cheap food. Tip: their spicy stuff isn't really spicy. At all.  Also, avoid their egg rolls, which are bland; go for the crab rangoon or some other fried treat."}
{"text":"This place is good!  Unassuming little place, with good, fresh food. Nice staff and always busy!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese and I found this place close to my place. I am happy I stopped by because the food was delicious. Service is good; and the woman who takes the orders is really nice. I have been here twice and both times, the food was very good"}
{"text":"It was ok. I had the sesame chicken. The sauce was pretty good, but the chicken was mediocre. There was very little actual chicken and it was mostly breading. They gave pretty generous portions, but all in all the lack of quality chicken was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. The fried rice was tasteful and the Chicken Lo Mein was very good. The customer service was even better. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"So I eat here probably way more than I should but it's only because it's delicious! The owners are really nice and helpful. And the food is like I said before, delicious. You always need a good go-to takeout place. This is mine. Try it out! Go during lunch. They have great specials."}
{"text":"I lived in Charlotte for 18+ years and now am back and forth between there and the Triangle region of NC. Mandarin has been my favorite place to get Chinese food in North Carolina. Every time I am in Charlotte, I make it a priority to visit this restaurant. Their Sesame Chicken lunch/dinner is by far my favorite dish and their egg rolls are amazing. The staff is very attentive and helpful and my food is always ready in a timely manner. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte about 6 months ago and went to lunch here for the first time. Loved it. Best Chinese restaurant I've been to since I've been here. Once a week or so visit to Mandarin won't hurt...will it?"}
{"text":"I've literally only had the hot and sour soup here but it's the best thing I've ever had in my life. I literally crave it. The soup alone earns this place five stars. This place is unfortunately about 30 minutes from my house but I'd totally drive just for that soup."}
{"text":"This place is honestly my favorite Chinese restaurant. I've tried several of their dishes, but their orange chicken & beef lo mein NEVER fail!!!!"}
{"text":"good prices, solid chinese takeout place. Always consistent dishes."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese takeouts around, beef isn't chewy like some other places.  Lunch special is about 5.50 after tax, so its not a bad deal.  Comes with choice of egg roll or soda, which is nice for non-egg roll fans like myself.  Beef+broccoli is actually quite good.  Egg drop soup is the best I have found at a take-out place in north Charlotte.  They are also really fast, usually under 5 minutes for beef dishes, under 10 for chicken dishes."}
{"text":"Quick , fast and easy phone in and picked up in 15 minutes.If you don't mind MSG food pretty good, fresh and hot. Can't beat the convenience!"}
{"text":"It's definitely not the best Chinese food. The meat seems to be a mystery almost as though it has been prepackaged and warmed. Meat has a rubbery texture. N sometimes the food doesn't seem that fresh regarding the ingredients. Cheap yes! But that doesn't mean it tastes good. Fried wanting we're decent."}
{"text":"I arrived here and place my order. After I paid I observed the cashier who was also getting ready to cook my food wipe his nose. I promptly requested a refund and walked out."}
{"text":"Decent cheap Chinese. The cream cheese wontons are great! I like it better than Panda Express and it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Love their food! Always fresh and delicious! Not much to look at theme wise, but it's clean and sanitary."}
{"text":"4 stars because they have great tasting food and very fair (almost cheap) prices.   3 stars would be too low and 5 stars would require higher quality ingredients and better options.   It's Chinese. About the same everywhere.  This place has awesome general tso's chicken and the standard run of the mill sweet and sour chicken that is awesome anywhere."}
{"text":"Food is great. Egg rolls a little dry for my taste. But on my last visit, I decided to use the bathroom. There was a bug in the toilet paper. Ask me if I've been back. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I use to go to this Chinese restaurant every week, if not 2 times a week. But I noticed the customer service becoming a huge problem. I overlooked several incidents, but I will never go to the Chinese restaurant again because the male owner threw my debt card and receipt at me. I'm very, very big on customer service, I can't and won't support a business that doesn't respect me."}
{"text":"We've been getting Chinese food from this business for several years. The majority of the time it's pretty good. However, there have been a few times when the sesame chicken tasted kind of rubbery. I believe it is a family owned business and the people are always very friendly and very nice. One time I did take issue with seeing one of the cooks behind the counter preparing food while he was obviously ill - coughing and sniffing. On that day I turned around and walked out. I do understand that no restaurant is 100% sanitary. That is the chance you take when you eat outside of your home. However, for the most part this is a decent place to get Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mandarin regularly for several years now. This is a great spot for Chinese take-out, and the owners are super nice. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Close to my house! The food is good and fresh. I like their hot and sour and lo mein dishes. I usually just get take out but have seen people sitting to eat."}
{"text":"Best Chines in the area. Chicago had some of the best local Chinese I've eaten to date."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming here with Eli, we were playing games and after all that mental exertion we had to get our chow on.  I had never been here before but Eli is a weekly regular.  They greeted him by name.  This place is a tie with Lotus, it costs more and is a bit better but the price and quality are close enough they cancel each other out.  If I had a coupon for this place it would hands down beat Lotus.  This is another of what I would call KFC equivalent greasy Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The restaurant doesn't look like much and isn't really for dining in but the food was awesome. The food was not greasy or heavy and tasted fresh. It did not taste like your typical cheap take out Chinese food. Decently priced. We will be visiting again"}
{"text":"While in a very convenient location this place just isn't good. I gave it several times to impress me but after the last time I won't ever be back.   Their food just isn't consistent nor very flavorful and the employees are rude. Especially the lady who takes your order. I tried to order sesame chicken but asked for white meat and she said it wasn't possible. So I decided to get lo mein instead. Easy, right? No. I typically don't like cabbage in it or carrots so I asked for it without those two items but could I please add onions instead. She said it would be an extra couple of dollars. This seemed ridiculous to me because why would she charge me extra when I'm basically just ordering noodles with onions?   I've also ordered their sweet and sour shrimp twice and while the first time it was good the second time it was so laden with grease I couldn't eat more than one. Their fried rice is also really dry and bland.   This location needs to learn how to be more polite and accommodating to their customers because other restaurants nearby go above and beyond. As such, there is no reason to deal with difficult businesses."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty solid. I've been there probably about 10x after moving to area , but i love Asian food. Everything has been fresh tasty. Soups are really good also. Don't know about any msg , didn't ask lol"}
{"text":"Very tiny restaurant, doesn't appear to be very good - but friendly, cheap, and delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch combo of sesame chicken and white rice and received sesame chicken with pork rice. I do not eat pork, so I had to eat the ride around the pork. The sauce used for the chicken isn't as sweet as I would have liked. Overall I give it two stars because I'm hungry and they are the closest Chinese takeout in the Northlake area."}
{"text":"My favorite in the area! Food is made quickly and is pretty good for takeout. Food prices are comparable.   I'm a Plain Jane when it comes to takeout- I only eat fried rice, lo mein, and the donuts. They are always consistent no matter what.   The combo portions are pretty small IMO so I prefer to order my items separately.    This is a typical takeout joint in a plaza. Good food, not fine dining but it'll fill you up!"}
{"text":"The food at Mandarin is great - except it has MSG.  With that in mind, I can no longer enjoy the great menu selections.  However, my daughter lives for their food and goes every chance she gets!  The location is convenient and orders can be phoned in for pick up.  If you don't mind the MSG, you can't go wrong with Mandarin."}
{"text":"About as simple as they come.  Typical strip mall, primarily take-out Chinese place. Lunch averages $5-$6 and is worth no more than that.  Tried the Hunan Chicken and it was fairly blah.  The fried rice was oily and the tea was old.  The interior was below average.  They didn't even have a drink or ice dispenser.  You got your ice from a small blue Igloo cooler.  Yup, just like the ones you take to a tailgate party!  If you're in the area where Harris Blvd ends & connects with Mt. Holly-Huntersville Rd, and are jonesing for some fast Chinese, then give'em a shot.  If you're more than a stones throw away, then pick another spot!  I gave'em two stars merely for the convenience factor.  If it weren't for that, then it'd be one star."}
