{"text":"The Cisco Burger that I ate was not only enormous but combined the flavors in perfect proportions. For only $7 I got more than I could eat. Would recommend and plan on returning soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and had a burger, gyro burger, fries and a soda  Yummy!  Also chatted with the owner who was very nice.
Thanks you for a delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny place on Park St serving soft-serve ice cream, Chicago dogs, sandwiches, home fries, etc.  This is a tiny place--only 1-2 booths outside and some outdoor seating. You'll note that they have no ice cream--just soft serve, slushies, etc.  You can get a knockoff of a Dairy Queen Blizzard called a Cyclone and they do offer a lot of toppings for you to choose from.  Haven't had the food, but the ice cream was good and the menu was reasonably priced. I actually noticed that the chocolate soft serve was more \"chocolate-y\" than most places.  Open from \"around 11am to around 11PM\""}
{"text":"Super-cheap soft serve, slushies, and various other treats. As the name implies, it's carnival food. 

Small, but discarded seats from Tilt-A-Whirl-like rides outside for your seating pleasure. We just got our ice cream & chilly willys (ice cream + slush puppies) to go and ate it on the walk back to my friend's home a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Wow. Owner got mad at my review, questioned why I didn't contact him directly at the time, and I responded completely civilly, thinking it was an interesting question. (Ultimately deciding that since we ordered take-out, we didn't feel like calling to complain, waiting another 30 minutes, etc, and definitely didn't want to try it again, so there's that) He replied:

\"You are as pretentious as I suspected, sorry for contacting you bitch!!  I NEVER bought anything prepackaged, and if you really cared, you'd ask, I wouldn't have to jam it down your throat, sorry you have to be 'convinced' what good food is.\"

Umm..."}
