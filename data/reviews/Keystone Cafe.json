{"text":"As the ONLY cafe on Technology Drive, they serve pretty good sandwiches. Ate the mushroom chicken, it was pretty good on a ciabatta bread. It comes with a small side too (salad, coleslaw, chips etc.). They also have a soup of the day, which is pretty refreshing for a snowy afternoon."}
{"text":"Staff was very upbeat and kind, excellent breakfast sandwich with lots of options. Really can't go wrong for 2.75! When I went it was cash only but there is an ATM very close by."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Pittsburgh! 
The soup of the day, is ALWAYS delicious, made fresh daily, and from scratch might I add.

The view is breathtaking whether it's summer, winter or fall. You get a view of the Southside and Allegheny. In the summer they offer out door seating, with umbrellas to block enough Sun to make it a comfortable choice.

My recommendations are: 
*the stuffed green pepper soup
*the roasted red pepper soup
*the Greek salad with grilled chicken
*the Portobello sandwich
*the Italian sandwich 
*the buffalo wrap is the MOST popular item on the menu and *the roast beef and gorgonzola wrap is my absolute favorite!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Keystone Cafe is the only lunch option at the end of Technology Drive.  At work, we are lucky to be across the river from the Southside and lots of other options nearby (if you drive) but sometimes you gotta grab a quick lunch.   Greg and the crew do a great job at the Keystone Cafe.  My favorites are Buffalo Chicken Wrap and the Greek Salad.   Just yesterday I got a Chicken Curry Vegetable soup which was near perfect!   Huge window with view of the river."}
