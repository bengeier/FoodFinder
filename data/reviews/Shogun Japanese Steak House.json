{"text":"Tried this place last night for dinner, and it was amazing! All the food was delicious and very fresh. We ordered chicken tempura, and sushi to go. We had a little trouble with the online ordering, when we got to the restaurant they said they never got our order, but they had our food ready in 10 minutes. The prices were very reasonable too. Everything was great, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sushi review -  OK at best. Best sushi in monroeville. Would get 3 stars if price matched quality. It doesn't.  If your in monroeville and need a quick fix,  go for it. Otherwise skip."}
{"text":"came here for the first time new year's eve. got take out and I was the last customer of the year. friendly staff and outstanding food. safe to say I'll be a regular. actually waiting for an order now."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Went for dinner on a Sunday evening. Enjoyed the hibachi set up. Funny chef, great food. Shogun is better that Benihana's and more affordable. I definitely plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Clean place. Great sushi. Good prices. Haven't tried the hibachi however sushi was very good. I will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Food was very dry. Ended up getting sick after eating here. Manager was kind but did nothing to fix it. Will never go back will stick with saga"}
{"text":"Disappointed at how this restaurant has gone downhill. We've been coming here for years and have always loved it. On our recent visit, the cook rushed through cooking the meal, over cooked the shrimp and undercooked the rice and vegetables. It was the fastest I have ever seen hibachi made. The meal was nowhere near as good as it used to be. Pretty disappointed. The restaurant was practically empty. Staff was strange as well and the restaurant seemed dirty and neglected."}
{"text":"We had an excellent time here tonight... Great service.  The Shrimp & Filet Mignon was delicious... My boyfriend lived in Japan for 8 yrs & said the Sushi was very good.."}
{"text":"I had the best experience here. Manager is nice, chefs are awesome, foods are phenomenal. Presentation is beyond great. Cool place! Ps: I really like the salad dressing."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for homecoming and it was completely deserted. Only one person came in to get takeout while we were there. So we thought that was a little weird. We ordered gyozo as an appetizer and it was amazing! The service was great and we got our food pretty fast. The hibachi was a great performance and the food was great. The prices weren't bad at all and I definitely would go again. The only bad thing is that they don't throw the shrimp in your mouth."}
{"text":"I think the food is very over rated. Way too expensive for food that was overcooked and dry. Never going back there again"}
{"text":"A marvelous Japanese Hibachi style steakhouse.   This is my wife's favorite restaurant.  It has great atmosphere and is not a \"chain\" Japanese restaurant.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one of the best hibachi restaurants I have been too. Great food. We actually did take out 3 times in two days!"}
{"text":"I ordered on-line for it to be ready at 5:30 and it wasn't ready until 5:59. I could understand if they were busy however only 4 people were in the entire restaurant. I love sushi and have had sushi everywhere I can find. This was hands down the worst sushi I've ever had in my entire life. I wouldn't call it sushi though since it was all fake. I had to push crab stick out of all my rolls but they were still inedible because the taste of the crab stick was so potent. The shrimp tempura in the rolls were so small I had to take it a part to see if it was really in there. I've never given a review on yelp but after this experience and the $86 bill for takeout, I wanted to give an honest review so everyone knows what to expect. Yuck..."}
{"text":"Teppanyaki Grill & Sushi Bar.  Went for the sushi and was pleasantly surprised. The young Sushi Master is very skilled.  He is Chinese and his command of English and Japanese is limited, but the waitress is a darned good interpreter.  I got what I ordered each and every time. Well prepared and super-fresh.  Prices are competitive and quality is A1.  Location is 1/2 mile west of S.O.M. Center on the south side of Euclid Avenue in the end unit of a strip mall.  This place is new and deserves patronage by lovers of good food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hibachi grills. The decor is delightfully tacky. The food is fantastic and the staff is wonderful. The service was quick and friendly. Never had a problem here."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and once we got it home, we found a hair in our food. Decided to give it another try a few months later.....found another medium length black hair. We will not be back."}
{"text":"By far my favorite hibachi style restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It seems to be under new management but they kept all the recipes from before.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Shogun has always been one of my favorite places to go. This is your typical hibachi style restaurant, and it's especially fun when you are with a larger group, otherwise, you are seated with random strangers. The chefs usually put on a little \"show\", flipping shrimp into their chef hats, lighting things on fire, etc. The food is good, I usually go with the steak/shrimp combo. You start with a salad with ginger dressing, and soup, then you have your entree. The prices are a bit high for what you get, but I've never had any complaints with how anything has tasted. The wait is somewhat long, every time we have been there, it's been really busy, but they do accept reservations."}
{"text":"Just tried it out for the first time, the meal was awesome and the service was quick. Very nice place. Sushi was great. Will be a family favorite for years to come."}
{"text":"Delicious. Would visit again. I liked their edamame and chicken hibachi."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome service!!!! Great environment and extremely great party rooms.... they accommodated 25 of us on 10 minute notice. They sang happy birthday too!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. Great food and the chef at the table was friendly and enjoyable. Prices good for this type of restaurant.  Did carry out tonight. They said 20-30 minutes but it ended up being 50. I asked that everything was in there. Score leaving and they said yes. Got home and one meal was missing. Called and had to drive back. At least it was ready this time.  I will likely done in again, but probably won't do carry out again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! The lunch maki combo is perfect and they're fast enough that you can get in and out in 45 minutes to an hour, which is wonderful. I've also had the bento box, which is also delicious, but the sushi is just so good I can't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Fun with Han solo best chef!  No alcohol but just saying. You may be able to pick up a bottle of wine next door.  Fun for birthdays or whatever.  Small place so call if you come with your big groups.  Nice neighborhood place."}
{"text":"This place has REALLY gone down hill!! We have been coming here for years - mostly for family birthday celebrations a few times a year. Tonight we went for my dad's birthday. The food was ok and our chef was not very talkative or entertaining. The worst part, though, was the bathroom - it was absolutely DISGUSTING . My feet stuck to the floor, the mirrors were filthy, the stalls were filthy and dusty - it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months - SO GROSS!! It really makes you wonder - if the bathroom is that dirty, what does the kitchen look like. We won't be returning there anytime soon - such a turn-off!"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes at the hibachi. Chef never came.  We asked for him and he never showed. 3 of us left without food. One managed to get some sushi, that was atleast decent and quick.  Won't be returning. Try harder guys or hire more staff!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi roll is little bit small compare to the average size,especially the shrimp tempura roll,normally I always get 2 pieces shrimp tempura inside the rolls that I got in every sushi place,this is too small that you can barely taste the shrimp. I ordered take out late night, but I think they just started to do my order after I get in the store and pay for it. Give them 3 stars because the sushi roll tastes good even the chef didn't roll it very perfectly."}
{"text":"Very typical hibachi place. Food was food it was good and the chef was nice. A little young and over zealous on the showmanship, I want to take my eyebrows home. But the atmosphere could be cleaned up a bit more for the price paid. I went for a work dinner and wouldn't make an effort to return to this place. It was pleasantly forgettable."}
{"text":"This is a typical, Hibachi-style restaurant that is a little dated in terms of décor, etc. - but it delivers.  It's nothing over-the-top, but nothing to worry about either.  The food is good (and plentiful) and the wait staff goes out of their way to accommodate you.   They are currently going through new ownership and working to get their liquor license, which may pose a problem for anyone who comes looking for some drinks...but that should change in a few weeks.  That said, we had an enjoyable experience and would recommend this spot to anyone near the Monroeville Mall who is looking for this type of meal.  Enjoy the leftovers!"}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend to try hibachi for the millionth time but we were craving it so we decided to give Shogun a try.  The food quality was average to good with the prices a little higher than most hibachi restaurants. I felt the meal was also more rushed than most hibachi experiences, even considering the quickness of the usual dining experience with hibachi. Fine for a local once in a while spot but I would not go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"I was excited to find that there's a teppanyaki shop here. We arrived on a Sunday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. You can be asked to be seated at the teppanyaki tables (shared with other parties) or at a small table and order sushi.   For teppanyaki, you order which protein you want and all the meals come with a large scoop of fried rice, mixed vegetables, soup, and salad. The chef also gives a little show much like Benihana while he cooks the food.   The servers and chefs here were very nice and he lowered the butter content for me. The reason why I gave 2 stars is because of the food quality and taste. It really wasn't very good compared to what I've had before. Probably even worse than that place in Hawaii. I would not recommend this joint. Their prices are quite high as well, not worth it. You'll get much better Japanese food at Chaya for around the same price or slightly more."}
{"text":"Hibachi grill lovers. We have eaten here so many times over the years that is is a comfortable old haunt. We are usually seated within 15 minutes or less as they fill up then next grill with patrons. The place is very busy on weekends but they seem to have learned to handle the crowd. Long gone are the Japanese chefs, replaced by every and any other ethnicity. Last two times we have a young many who loved the Steelers and spent his coking time talking about them. But gosh he lost track and overcook most entrees. The food is generally ok to good but far from great. We can and will eat here without too much worry. Good in a pinch for something other than table service. I think many people come for the show and uniqueness of the hibachi. But for us, it is not new, unique or exciting. They are showing their tiredness. Because of the general so-so ishness at best of this place we have not eaten the sushi.  The place needs rejuvenation, bring in the spa for a facial and full body message on this place."}
{"text":"Horrible experience all around. Placed a take out order and it was told to be a 10 to 15 minute wait. I arrived to a nearly empty restaurant on a Friday night that had an overwhelming smell of burnt oil. I should have turned around and left right there. Also, I arrived 20 minutes after my initial call was placed, expecting my food to be ready when I got there. They obviously didn't start cooking until they receive payment for their order. I received my food  45 minutes after the order was placed. When asked if this was normal, the reply was that the kitchen was very busy. There were three tables there with people, and no one at the hibachi bar. I was the only take out order the entire time I was there. Don't even get me started on how bad the food was once I got it home. Never again!"}
{"text":"This place was very busy when I went on the weekend at night and then again during the week for lunch. I only ate there once for lunch and it was just okay. I think that the kinks need to be worked out and then they will improve. The staff need to improve their knowledge of the menu but I do plan on going back in a few months after they become more established."}
{"text":"Nothing better than some good sushi for lunch. Not too heavy and greasy but at the same time its quite filling. I this is the best sushi restaurant within the area. There is on other one up the road about 5 minutes but it was not good at all. On the other hand, this sushi place is pretty good. I've gone by myself and with coworkers for lunch on many occasions.  There is a good range of options to choose from. This time I ordered the lunch Sushi Bento Box. (Salad as my appetizer). The sushi, presentation, and freshness were all really good. Only thing is the service can be a bit slow at times so I wouldn't recommend going if you have to rush back for a meeting!"}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary, but it is good. I've never had a bad experience here.  PROS: Consistent (in terms of both food and service)  CONS: due to age, its gotten a bit dingy over the years--a remodel is overdue"}
{"text":"This is a typical Japanese steakhouse that has been around for years in Monroeville, though it was my first visit here.  Now they also have a sushi bar, but I couldn't possibly recommend it.  I say this even though I never tried the sushi.  I tried though.  The menu listed all of their items in English only (not good).  I confirmed that the fatty tuna was toro, but the lady did not know which kind.  I ordered that, but I was told a couple of minutes later that they didn't have any.  I then ordered the sea urchin (uni), and, again, a couple of minutes later I was told they did not have any.  On a Saturday night at a sushi bar?  Really?  This is why I can't recommend it.  Maybe they have rolls, but they don't have sushi.    On the hibachi side, everything was just okay.  The chef introduced himself and confirmed our orders.  He then proceeded cooking all of the items, and never interacted with the audience again.  For me, that seemed a bit aloof, though his performance did have a couple of tricks I have not seen before.    For the food, I was mostly disappointed.  The fried rice was overcooked and lacked egg.  The extra soy and the crunchy rice was not very palatable.  The vegetables were fine, but the shrimp was overcooked.  Also, the grill was surprisingly dirty by the end of the routine.  But I was very pleased with my teriyaki mahi mahi.  It was much better than I could have possibly expected given how everything else turned out.  So the place has potential, but it is not consistent enough to recommend.  Also soju on the menu suggests to me that the place is Korean run.   2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place has been here forever, and I've always loved it since I was little. The service was great and the food was also good. The waiter was also very fun and friendly. Good for a family night out."}
{"text":"I really need to get caught up on my reviews ....so here goes !    Even though we arrived shortly before closing our server was polite and pleasant.   Place looks clean and fresh ...and it should, its still new !   I had  chicken noodle hibachi stir fry (made in back )  it came out hot and steaming (yay)  chicken was slightly dry but I did request that the chicken be cooked after a bad experience with pink uncooked chicken elsewhere so now I'm gun-shy so I can't fault them for that if it isn't always the way they make it.  The other half had some sushi, all were made dead on and very good !!  I'm a casual sushi eater and pretty picky about it not tasting \"fishy\" and it did not (yay) .   Salads were crisp and very good, better than most salads making kind wish there was more, something I rarely wish for since most places fill them with foo foo things that guys don't eat.   Overall not bad and priced fair, since we were there before closing I can't speak for how they would be during a \"crush\"   They do need a low sodium (green top)  option  for Soy Sauce, even a few packets for those with sodium concerns.  I would have given a 3.5  as it was a fan but its better than ok."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are big sushi lovers. We are always looking to try new sushi places around Cleveland, but we often find ourselves at Shogun. The sushi here is good quality and delicious, not to mention the Sushi Roll Party for 2 is an excellent deal for the amount and quality of the sushi compared to other places around town. The service can be slow at times, but they are always friendly. We have never done it, but have seen a couple of times where they have allowed people to BYOB. Overall, it is a great, local and convenient sushi place, and we hope to see business pick up for them."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant. Very friendly people, great sushi/hibachi (try the jalepeño roll) traditional Japanese atmosphere and a really cool drink selection. Be careful because it can get pricy, but it's definitely well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is my in-laws' go-to restaurant for birthday dinners. We went recently for my father-in-law's birthday. We had a big group, but the service was still pretty prompt and the servers were nice enough.   The hibachi guys put on a good show, with flames and onion smoke volcanoes and all that good stuff. The food is pretty good, considering that it's pretty much just meat and veggies and soy sauce, and the portions are pretty large.  Hibachi dinners are always a little expensive for my tastes, but we did have a good time and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I have had favorite Japanese Restaurants in DC and also San Francisco, and this location is a contender for some of the greats! Friendly service, delicious food, and a clean and warm atmosphere. This is now my favorite local spot in my hometown."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 2 stars because of the bar.  My parties drinks were delicious!  That being said, wild horses would have to drag me back to that place.    We had a 15 minute wait. Not bad for a Friday night.  Went to the bar had a delicious blue drink, paid,shortly after we were seated.  The waitress was friendly enough took out order brought over soup/salad.  I enjoyed the soup,  I thought the ginger dressing tasted of mustard, didn't like that at all,  but was still not really bothered. Then we sat,  and sat, when we inquired when our chef was going to start preparing our meals we were told there were no more chefs in the back and had to wait for one to finish with another table, so we sat.  At about the hour mark (thank God for electronics to keep the kiddos from complaining) we get up to leave,  that is when the manager comes over to apologize and offers us 20% off if we stay.  I agree but only if the chef is at our table within the next 5 minutes.  Exactly 5 minutes later he comes,  asks about our meat temps and proceeds to dish out sauces.  He hands my party a blob of mayo?  What is this,  I ask?  This is mayo, he replies that it is mayo based, NO sir this is straigt mayo.  Now I have been frequenting hibachi restaurants for YEARS never had yum-yum sauce look or taste like that.  I was done. Asked him not to bother continuing with our meal (he hadn't started cooking anything) we left.    Manager had to the nerve to yell over to the bartender to make sure we paid for our drinks prior, which she had already asked me and I said yes!"}
{"text":"I took my son's basketball team here for lunch today and we had the most fantastic time! The food was delicious, the chef was talented, the waitress was extremely informative and the owners were appreciative and kind.  I had eight boys there and we all can't wait to come back! I got most of them to try California rolls for the first time, and they loved it! Thank you Pancy and David Wong for a wonderful afternoon!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer here since around 1995 or so. As others have said, this is a generally nice restaurant that has nevertheless seen better days. It's overpriced if you only consider the food - which is filling, but nothing special - but you're also paying for the ambiance and the hibachi grill performance. It's a solid choice for a group gathering (normal tables seat 8, private rooms seat more) but not really a place to go alone or on a regular basis.   If you are in a small group, be aware that they seat you with other parties to fill a table, presumably to keep the grilling and shows efficient. My most recent table had my party of seven plus one lone diner, which was honestly a bad setup. It's better when the groups are balanced, so that there can be two separate conversations going on. In our case, we just had the one random guy sitting silently at our table with his arms crossed, making the meal palpably awkward as we talked around him.  My most recent experience was also unusually bad food-wise. The salad was soggy and insubstantial, and the hibachi food was extremely salty. (Two hours later, I still have that salty \"gagged on sea water\" feeling in my mouth.) I didn't enjoy it. Plus, the portions were noticeably smaller than they used to be, despite the fact that the price was just as high. But keep in mind that that experience was not typical... Other than the portion size issue, I think we just had a bad chef."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good sushi but the atmosphere is quiet and awkward. It's small and there is no music playing or alcohol served. It also doesn't seem to get very busy. I tried getting take out the next time I went and they didn't provide soy sauce and the receptionist was not very nice."}
{"text":"I am not even sure how to adequately express my displeasure here. I arrived for lunch and the place was practically empty. Never a good sign in a busy area like Monroeville.   I get the menu and it's totally smeared by either hr ease or cleaning product. I look through and nothing sounds super impressive, so I stick to basics including a making roll, miso soup and a hibachi appetizer. That comes out with the soup and the roll all within 5 minutes. Weird pacing, but whatever. One bite into the appetizer and I know I will not be taking another bite. It tastes both burned and undercooked at the same time. I bite into a piece of the roll and it's ok. But after the appetizer I'm totally freaked out by any seafood item here. So I figure I'll just enjoy my tea and soup....but even the tea tastes sour! I drink unsweetened tea daily, so it is NOT the lack of sugar throwing me off. It just tastes metallic from sitting around for a very long time. Eeek.  I will not be back and recommend you continue on up the road to Taipei-Tokyo for your sushi needs."}
{"text":"How great was this find.  Took my Wife out for dinner and we couldn't decide where to go.  It was then my Wife said how about that shogun place in that small stop plaza off Euclid. So off we went.  They have a Hibachi side and a Resturant side.  For some crazy reason I said lets do Hibachi side.  Good choice on my part.  My Wife had scallops and shrimp combo and I had the steak and chicken.  Everything was cooked spot on.  It also was seasoned to perfection. The Hibachi cook also had assent of humor that clicked with mine. Best Hibachi tasting food in the area."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. I remember loving going to Shogun as a kid. I tried to continue this tradition with my daughter I taking her there every week. Over time the meat was tasting worse and worse. The service is always great I'm so terrible but I cannot remember the woman's name who always waited on us. My last attempt to eating there a man told me I would have to wait 15 minutes to be seated with my two year old because there was no one to sit with us. The restaurant was empty and children get a bit anxious. I tried to ask him if we can sit in at least get sushi while we were waiting and he got frustrated with us and told me no. We left soon after going to Yamato and got fantastic service. We will not be back to Shogun which is sad because it was such a great family tradition"}
{"text":"I was visiting family in town and wanted to go to Shogun, one of my favorite childhood restaurants. Unfortunately, the management could not have been less accommodating. We went on a Thursday night, thinking it would not be crowded. When we arrived, there were only two tables full, no one waiting, and only one other reservation besides ours for the entire night. Given that we have a toddler and an infant, we requested one of the back rooms with bench seating. The hostess went around and around with us, until telling us we could have a back room for an extra $30 (we had 6 people total instead of the \"required\" 8). Annoying, but necessary for our infant, so we said ok. Then, one member of our party was running 5 minutes behind, and the hostess told us we'd have to order within 10 minutes of sitting down, regardless of whether or not our final person was there. Keep in mind the place was NOT busy. We politely told the hostess that she was not being very friendly to her customers - the same attitude and difficulty continued. I could understand these restrictions if they were busy - but they were far from it. You'd think they'd be friendly and grateful for the business. We finally decided to leave and go to another hibachi place because we didn't want to give our money to a place that treated their customers with such disregard. It's a shame that they are not at all accommodating or friendly to their clientele!"}
{"text":"Great experience all around.  Contemporary decor, nice selection, exciting hibachi. Nothing exotic on the menu, but reasonable prices. Great place for dates! Fast take out if you want to enjoy the food at home. Avacado roll had a massive amount of avacado!!! They don't skimp on the portions."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place even existed until I received one of their menus in my mailbox. I'm so glad I did! Tucked away in a strip mall on Euclid Avenue, Shogun is a welcomed addition to the area. We sat on the dining side, but patrons have the option of sitting at the actual hibachi tables as well. I've had my fill of onion volcanoes and catching food in my mouth, but I know many people like this form of entertainment.   We ordered the shrimp hibachi meal and 2 different sushi rolls. The hibachi meal was some of the best I've ever had. The shrimp were fresh and cooked perfectly. The vegetables were still crunchy and flavorful. I forget the names of the rolls I ordered but both were very good. One had tempura salmon, avocado, and fresh salmon on top. The other one was lightly tempura battered and had shrimp, avocado, and cream cheese on the inside. It was topped with baked crab. Delicious.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Start off with service. Service is great. Chefs are great. Tommy's one we ask for when he's in. Friendly, efficient wait staff. Ok, now for the GOOD stuff. We usually get the Imperial. (fillet/shrimp/lobster/scallops/rice/vegetables, etc). Both my wife and I agree the fillet is better than most of the steakhouses we've been too. Scallops are tender, shrimp is fresh. (great, now I just drooled on my keyboard). Everything is cooked perfectly, portion size is EXCELLENT. We usually have another meal left over when we're done. We've gone there to celebrate, and for comfort food, as well as take out when we can't dine in. The take out is just as good as the dine-in. I'll just say that I've been to other Shogun restaurants, but this is the best I've visited. They do it right."}
