{"text":"I was disappointed, I work in the neighborhood and was excited at the prospect of a healthy quick place to gab lunch. I tried to substitute the type of chicken in my wrap from Cajun to Grilled and they wouldn't let me, and then wanted to switch the type of lettuce and was told that it would be an up-charge.  I then decided to go with a safe pick of Chicken Cesar wrap.  Then it came out.... it was TINY like the size of a softball. Taste of the wrap was mediocre at best.  I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"Three stars because I like salad that does not consist of iceburg lettuce and I can definitely get that here.  I also like salad with lots of \"stuff\" on it and I can definitely get that here.  The food is always fresh (or so it seems) and it doesn't destroy my stomach like other salads do (I'm thinking they don't use the preservatives that other places use but I can't confirm).  Basically, Food = 4 stars.  They lose a star for the service.  There are a couple workers who really don't seem to enjoy their jobs AT ALL!  I understand people have a bad day every now and then and I try very hard to cut food service workers a lot of slack.  I probably wouldn't want to deal with a bunch of mall lunch eating morons either.  However, I'm not that difficult to please.  I don't expect to hear your life story or theories on how to improve the economy.  But please please please say \"hello\", \"thank you\", \"is there anything else I can get for you?\", \"is that for here or to go?\"!  I promise I will be very courteous and nice in reply.  I would tip you if there was a tip jar.  I would smile and try to let you know that I appreciate your service and the fact that you don't leave my nearly $7 salad about 4 feet across the counter and then walk away.  Jumping over counters to get a salad isn't my idea of a good time.    Go here if you like salad with many options.  Lots of veggies and greens and proteins and cheeses to try!  Be friendly to the staff and maybe it will catch on and I will get a pleasant server one of these days."}
{"text":"I had an awesome wrap from Chop It!  It was a Chicken Sante Fe with rice. The dressing was raspberry vinaigrette."}
{"text":"Chop It Salad does what it does extremely well.  There was a fly or two buzzing around the many beautiful offerings, but I chose to look the other way.  The service was fab, and the array of toppings and dressings, astounding.   The size of the salads is so generous, you're sure to bring some home.  Great dining option at Eton."}
{"text":"If you like hair as a condiment in your food, this is the perfect place for you. We decided to order food from here for a staff members birthday and ended up with quite the surprise in our food items. When we opened up our food, some of us noticed there was hair in our food, as they went further into the sandwiches, they found more hairs. Not wanting similar experiences, the rest decided they didn't want to eat the food after the others found hair in theirs. We called chop it to tell them about the hair and to ask for a refund. Not once did the person on the phone apologize, instead we got a 'wow that is really rare to happen.' Yes, I do hope that it's rare but I would also like the money back that we wasted. The person said she couldn't give us our money back as she doesn't have the authority and instead instructed us to get a hold of their corporate office. Clearly customer service isn't one of their strong points either. I would expect better especially when you are about to lose business from another small business near yours. Eat with caution as you never know what kind of surprise you may find next time you head over to this place and clearly they're not willing to take responsibility for their own mistakes (or hairs!)"}
{"text":"Yeah, I love this place. Sometimes the wait is a little longer than I would prefer, approx 10 minutes, and their almost always seems to a problem swiping with the credit card machine. To be fair though, my friend got his salad for free after the cashier gave up trying to figure out the problem.  But the salads are fantastic! Every time they are delicious, they have ample topping selections and dressings. There are a number of pre-prepared variations(I love the Greek), but you can mix and max to your hearts content.   The other great thing about Chop It is that you can order ahead of time. One time, we ordered for my small department and they had 10 salads ready to go at the time of pickup. That's not an easy thing to put together.  I suppose the only knock is that Chop It flys under the radar inside a mall, but the food is really good, and I would highly recommend for lunch if you are in the Eton Plaza area, and are up to spend approx $9-$10."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Always have.   I've been choosing Chop It as a healthy mall food alternative while shopping for years now and what finally made me write a review is that I messaged the company today asking for a nutritional value menu. The president of the company emailed me a PDF quickly.   SO HAPPY to say that they aren't one of those joints where you think you're picking a healthy option but then later find out your salad has more calories than 3 Big Macs. Who wants a 1,200 calorie salad?   Everything on their menu is the same caloric value as if you made a salad at home - all healthy, sensible options. Which is fantastic because their salads are so good you almost wouldn't believe that. They're tasty as can be.   So basically an upgraded version of Subway - better, healthier ingredients that are fresh, and way more options as well.   \"Fast food\" salad joints need to all take a lesson from Chop It - while I love a good salad regardless, if it's more calories than the deep fried options I don't want it. They're breaking the mold by marketing themselves as healthy and actually following through on that claim and I wish more companies would follow suit."}
{"text":"When I initially described this place to my roommate she responded, \"So it's like a salad bar?\" Well.... kinda But only in the sense of a very FANCY salad bar.  The menu consists of every salad fixing under the sun (over 50 toppings) from which you can either choose one of their signatures or make your own by choosing your lettuce, toppings and dressing. There is an extra costs for adding certain items like meats and other high-value items but for the most part a salad will run you about $9. You can also get your salad in the form of a wrap if yo so desire.   I went at lunchtime on a Friday with some coworkers and we received very good service. The workers were very attentive and ready to help us.  Overall a good experience the only thing that keeps me from going too regularly is the price."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick salad for lunch? Looking for a light meal while shopping? This is THE place.  If you've ever been to Chicago, then you probably know about Food Life in Water Tower Place (and if you don't, then check it out). They have a bunch of different food kiosks in an upscale food court setting. The salad kiosk there is fantastic and I've been searching NE Ohio to find something similar. And boy, have I found it.  Chop It Salad Co. opened recently at Eton earlier this year. It got a pretty good write up in the Plain Dealer so I figured I'd check it out. Now, I hate places that fill you up with greens and give you the tiniest amount of actual salad toppings. I mean, it's the toppings that make the salad, the greens are just one part of the equation! This is a place where you can fill your salad to the brim and you won't be snubbed, so make sure you take advantage of it (Yeah, so what if I need my salad filled with bell peppers.?). Beware, there are premium ingredients that cost a little extra. But that's par for the course.  The dressing selection borders on ridiculous. Red Bell Pepper Italian? Chipotle Salsa Ranch? You won't get bored with the huge dressings selection. Similarly, I appreciate the wide variety of toppings. What kind of place lets you have shrimp on your own salad creation? An awesome one.  Don't like salad? Well, you can create a wrap instead! Who doesn't love wraps? You can also get smoothies here, but I haven't tried any.  Service is pretty quick and I was a little surprised the place isn't more crowded during the lunch rush, what with all the suburban office parks nearby. I'm thinking it's the ridiculous parking at Eton that might make some people stay away.  For the TLDR crowd: Good salad, huge topping/dressing choice, quick service, decent prices. (And even though this technically qualifies as fast food, this is very healthy fast food!)"}
{"text":"First I must say I have been spoiled with a salad place that has locations in NYC and DC.  This place looks similar at first glance, but pales in comparison. The most disappointing are the jalapeno peppers. They aren't fresh. The chicken was the highly processed salty  chunks that are barely food. Overall, the salad was so salty I couldn't eat it all and I didn't even have them add salt."}
