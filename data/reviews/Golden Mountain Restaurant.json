{"text":"Food is good. People are nice. Family owned.
Three things that you look for when dining out."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food.   Nothing to write home about but solid fare.   They make pretty good vegetable fried rice.

Been here a couple of times, typically not busy, but service has always been good and the prices are very reasonable.   I will be back when in area.

Go ahead and check them out."}
{"text":"If you want typical Chinese takeout, this place will do the job.  Nothing special, but it was fresh.  They forgot to include the eggroll in my combo platter, which was disappointing, but for what I paid I felt the quantity and quality was decent.  Will I go back?  Only if I'm in a pinch and craving Chinese."}
{"text":"Love this old school Chinese place.  Best pork subgum.  The service is good.  The food is delish and plentiful!  Highly reccommend!"}
{"text":"The fastest service, best tasting chinese food in the area! The dining room is a nice place to enjoy your meal also. Wished they delivered."}
{"text":"I went to this nice and lovely place for my lunch, I ordered a Sweet sour chicken and spring rolls. Rich source and the chicken was cooked very tender and juicy. Such quick and friendly service, they filled up my tea very often and quickly. I'll be back, it's a great place for a meal before a show."}
{"text":"It is a traditional Chinese restaurant. Beautiful decorating and all the friendly staffs work here. We tried the pon pon chicken which was so delicious! Their egg roll that has shrimp&chicken mixed inside,dipping with duck sauce. The BBQ rib was fancy!!! The price is reasonable and you must give it a try."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  It's served quick,  and polite.  It smells and tasted fresh.  Restaurant clean and peek in kitchen,  it's clean as well.  Have I had better?  Yes sure I have.  In this price range however it's excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Never dined in. Always take out. Great customer service.  Clean restaurant.  Fast service.  Try the orange chicken."}
{"text":"This place was extremely disappointing.  First of all, it was cold both in temperature and the way we were treated.  Stood around a good 10 minutes before we were acknowledged and then the service was extremely slow.  I love Chinese but this was just your average American Chinese.   I suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just moved here and have been looking for Chinese food near me. I was not impressed with this food at all. We spent $30 on food and could barely eat a plate of it. I have it in star cause it seemed like a clean place but the food was not good. The lo mein noodles smelled like dirty dish rag. I will not be visiting again. Sorry"}
{"text":"My favorite old school Cantonese style restaurant in the city of Cleveland. I have been a customer for over 30 years. The family is very friendly the food is fresh and the service is fast. The menu and flavors are true to form and never disappoints. This is a must eat place every time I come home to Cleveland. I crave their wonton soup when I am away from home for very long!"}
{"text":"Not the friendliest people, definite reflection their food. Only went cause it's close to my house. Egg roll was inedible, taste like fried rotten cabbage. Never going back, willing to drive further for better food for less."}
{"text":"I really want to give Golden Mountain a 3 star review but have really struggled with the food here.  The service is good, restaurant is clean, open, and inviting but the food really does struggle.  My 3-5 staples that I base Chinese restaurant reviews on, as you would see with Hunan East, are 1) Egg Drop, 2) Hot and Sour, 3) Lo Mein, 4) Crab Rangoons, 5) Egg Rolls or a standard dish such as Beef w/ Broccoli.  I have never gotten consistency here. 

You might be asking why do I base my review on those items, well its simple.  Think of the percentage of all customers going into a Chinese restaurant that are going to order one or more of the items above......pretty high huh.  Now if those items do not come out of the kitchen hot, consistently delicious, and spot on to expectations, what would that say about their other food, specifically their dinner plates?  Ex.  I have a place in Grand Rapids Michigan that I would drive an hour just for their egg rolls, they are that good.  Those alone made me go back again and again.  Am I being too anal??  Food review is below.

Their egg drop CAN be good; once it was like jello, once was cold with no salt added, and the other it was perfect.  Their lo mein has really skinny noodles, almost like rice noodles that just stick together and have no flavor (comparing to the standard lo mein noodle).  Where are the ingredients?  Crab rangoons have little stuffing, can be really oily, and just can't compare to Hunan East.  As for the other items listed, its just no up to snuff in my eyes.  But they do have a following and it seems to busy on most days, but I think that's only because the patrons there haven't tried my favorite on Richmond Rd."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to dine. More of Taco Bell for Americans. Food is so so. Nothing authentic at all."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant a few times but it was years ago.  I decided to give it a shot after our regular chinese take out place changed ownership and so did the food.  This was not very good at all.  I was very disappointed as it was my son's birthday and he didn't want to go out to eat, so I got take out.  I got the dinner for 3 which was $38 and the portions I received were ridiculous.  This was supposed to feed 3 people.  The chicken lo mein was mushy and tasteless.  The sweet and sour chicken only  had 3 pieces of chicken in it, the only good thing was the rib appetizer was good and the wonton soup, I will definitely not be back or recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place around - and I've been to many. I've dined in and ordered take out and I have never been disappointed. The portion sizes are fantastic and the prices reasonable. My favorites are the egg rolls, governors chicken, and the wonton soup!"}
{"text":"Best American Chinese Food ever. I've lived in a few places over the years and I still can't find a Chinese Restaurant that matches the taste of Golden Mountain. My family and I have been coming here for years. Every time I visit home I demand that we have at least one Golden Mountain dinner. The food is much  better quality than what you find at a Peking Chef or Panda Express. The prices are also very affordable."}
