{"text":"Cooked perfectly, very friendly staff. A bit too oily for me, so i'd recommend a good straining before the sauce goes on."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I have a new fav wing place! The wings were well cooked and seasoned. The sauce didn't drown the flavor of the chicken, just enhanced it. And their fried catfish sandwich was simply delicious. My family loved it and this our new wing spot indeed!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings! I had the \"ATL\" dry rub wings. The seasoning was flavorful and the wings were crispy. Just like I like them. I highly recommend this restaurant.  The mom and daughter ran the counter and were wonderful. And who doesn't love Koolaid? I will definitely be back. Best wings in town. Great to have an awesome wing place on the west side."}
{"text":"Omg, I love their honey bbq traditional wings. A friend introduced me to the restaurant since then I've been there 3 days in a row. You need to come check them out asap! Nummy,Nummy, Nummy."}
{"text":"ATL style wings are absolutely amazing! I'm definitely stopping by again! Crew is very friendly! Keep up good work guys!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best wings in town. I'm a big fan of their dry rub, but the hot sauces are real tasty too. Wings are nice and meaty, and never over cooked. Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"Wings were cold and soggy. Fries were also cold and soft. The staff was very rude example. I asked what were ATL fries she said look up on the board it explains what they are. And to top it off when I asked for an extra ranch the lady said they are 85 cents if I want one. This place is a joke. I will never go again. I stick with Native New Yorker or buffalo wild wings."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is the best place for wings. My family and I have been coming here for quite some time! The employees working there are always so friendly and courteous. The last time we were in there, I was having problems with my debit card and the cashier was nothing but helpful and patient.   If you're looking for some good wings this is the place! I would recommend the honey habanero. We probably order from here every three weeks!!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I typed \"Hot Wings\" in my mobile yelp app & seen great reviews about the wings at this place so family & I decided to venture 16 miles to try this joint. We ordered the Teriyaki, Hot & Honey Habanero Wings along with a side of Crinkle Fries & some Kool Aid. Fellow Yelpers were right! Crisp juicy mouth watering  flavors hit the spot. The Honey Habanero was everyone's favorite. These wings put other competitors to shame because of the size, flavors & being perfectly cooked. Others are right though about waiting awhile for your food,but once you have it you forget what you are waiting for. I highly recommend giving this place a shot. We will be back soon to try other flavors and items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was recently diagnosed with stage 4 leukemia and given only weeks to live. But after 12 ATL style and 6 spicy ATL wings along with an order of fries and spending MANY arduous hours on the toilet screaming and excreting what can only be described as hot lava the next day my cancer has gone into remission. Thank you ATL you saved my life."}
{"text":"Was put on hold for 15 minutes, girl picks up phone finally and asks if she can put me on hold, before I had a chance to say please don't she hung up the phone. No hold just hung up."}
{"text":"Stephanie was amazing! Her recommendations, service, and personality was amazing! I don't live in Phoenix,  but when I come back...PLEASE BELIEVE I'm making a stop here!! Rock it out Steph!"}
{"text":"Been waiting to try their wings since we missed out at a wing festival because their line was so long! Didn't disappoint. Delicious sauces and large, crispy wings! Even have Koolaid dispensers :)"}
{"text":"I've had better soul food in Toledo, Ohio. I ordered the catfish sandwich, a  side of okra, and a can of Dr. Pepper from ATL Wings today. The sandwich is a huge catfish filet but only comes with two slices of sandwich bread (enough for half of the filet), a dollop of mayo, and pickle sandwich slices.  No hot sauce?!! The only hot sauce was for sale, $4.35 with tax.  I was willing to buy a bottle so I could actually enjoy the tender fish sandwich but they were out. Come on ATL Wings get your act together! I bought the second to last Dr. Pepper in the cooler, the sandwich bread was inadequate, you don't provide complimentary hot sauce, and you have the only cashier serving double duty bagging to go orders. After I got my food I waited 10 minutes at my table for the line to go down so I could stand in line for ten minutes to buy a bottle of hot sauce that was sold out. I was not happy so I left my meal on the table. This visit was a major disappointment and a waste of $8.37. The okra was barely breaded and nothing special either."}
{"text":"Top notch food!! Wings were crispy and fries seemed fresh. Kool-aid ON TAP...WHAAAAAT?!! I'm in heaven. Good, clean dining area and the staff was helpful and friendly.  Will For sure be back."}
{"text":"These wings are by far superb! I love the soul that was put into each of the flavors I have tried. Honestly this is one of the best wing places regarding flavor, that I have been to. That being said, there are some things they could improve on. Things like: customer service, cleanliness, answering the phone, and creating a more pleasant environment for eating in or taking out. It seems that it it's painful for some of the staff to smile. The floors are very dirty, tables not wiped down, wasn't even busy when I went so someone could of took on the lobby chores. Maybe stop puffin L's out back, and pretend this is a potential respectable eatery for wing lovers. Invest some of that profit into a multi-line phone system, so you can cater to people who have hectic schedules, and need to pick up their order, rather than waiting an eternity inside. If ATL implements this feedback, they will be unstoppable!  -Yeshua Equals Alpha And Omega-"}
{"text":"Omg. We were already a fan of this place from Delivery, but eating it actually at the restaurant was somehow even better. ATL style changed our world. There has never been a more perfect wing place! There are no substitutes !! Thank you !!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I've been here before and they had high chairs for my daughter. But I guess they got rid of them."}
{"text":"I love ATL wings but the customer service here is very poor. I have only been here once with a good experience. I just tried to call at 7 pm to place a to go order and the lady who answered the phone hung up on me and she is ignoring my calls when I keep trying to place my order. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Best wings in Phoenix!  Went here for dinner 3 times during a 6-day visit.  Friendly, accommodating staff and the variety of wing flavors is terrific.  Side Note:  They were even kind enough to offer me a ride back to my hotel after finding out I was from out of town."}
{"text":"Good wings, reminds me of Long Wings. A lot of french fries. Good price, you get your monies worth. Way better than Wingstop."}
{"text":"My first visit. Wings were good. Service ok. Catfish not good but it is a wing place. I had the ATL seasoned wings. They were tasty but a bit salty. The cashier had a unwelcoming demeanor but she stayed on top of everyone's orders. I would go back for the wings and fries."}
{"text":"This place is so dang delicious, I drive out of my way just to get some of that tasty goodness.  I ain't never tried anything but the wings, and do not see that changing.  My 3 favorite flavors are seasoned, ranch, and traditional hot, and we are ready for take off.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, the bleu cheese is cheap store bought.  I wish they made their own or at least sprung for the good stuff.  The sides are a little boring.  Why not some homemade onion rings, jalapeno poppers, or fries (instead of boring frozen fries), and they do not deliver (my beach body thanks you guys for that one).   But, if it is mega-licious wings from America's favorite flightless bird, swing by, come hungry, and bring a friend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious Atlanta wings, you will not be disappointed. This is the real deal, and they know how to make wings the way they're supposed to be. Hot, crispy, big and full of flavor made to order. The people from the counter to the cooks to the ones cleaning tables are friendly & nice even when busy. And they keep the place clean-no greasy tables here! We tried both lemon pepper and medium spiced wings. The first hot crispy bite brought me straight to my happy place, and every bite after confirmed it. They know what they're doing and they do it well. Ranch & blue cheese dips are fresh & homemade-a perfect compliment to the tang & the spice. I love you ATL Wings, you are my new happy place!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved It here ! The employees were super friendly. Chefs special wing sauce is the bomb  must try !"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Food and costumer service were fantastic! We went to their new location on Thomas and 40th St. The work crew and I have found a new lunch spot =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I would always go to Wing Stop, but when we saw ATL Wings we jumped to try it! We have not been to Wing Stop since! They have cheap prices for great quantity and quality! It also only takes 5mins to get your wings. If it's busy your order is still out quickly. Great music! Great vibes! Matter of fact, I'm about to go get me some wings now!"}
{"text":"We've been going to ATL pretty much since they opened. There is no disputing they have good wings. But the last time we went, we were treated so disrespectful, it will be the last time we go. We ordered at 8:25, they close at 9:00. Even though we paid extra for to-go, I thought we would eat some of the TeN dollar fries, since they'd probably be a little soggy by the time we drove back to Mesa. I didn't think there was a problem, there were at least six other people there, and two more were in line after us. When we asked for a plate, the lady who took our order, (I only know her as the owners sister) rolled her eyes and said (with attitude), \"you gonna eat it here\"? When another customer asked if it was OK if they ate there, she walked out from behind the counter, waved her hand at us and said (with attitude and loud enough everyone in the restaurant heard), \"they eatin here so I ain't gonna tell you you can't.\" I was so embarrassed. Then she came over to us and said \"when we were done eating we could throw our trash away in the trash can. REALLY!?! That's when I stood up and said it's quite obvious you dont want us to eat here, so we'll go. She told me it really wasn't that big of a deal. Needless to say, we left. I was a fan of their wings, but there is no reason to be treated like that, especially after spending almost 60 dollars. If you don't care how you are treated, the wings are great (even though the prices have gone up a lot). I feel a business earns their customers with customer service and respect. So sadly, this is one customer who won't be back."}
{"text":"I always receive a warm welcome when I come. I love the variety and the atmosphere of the restaurant. They know me my name and make a point to speak to everyone that comes in the building. Ima favorite flavors are Chefs Special, Ranch and Citrus Chipotle and NEVER leave without some biscuits"}
{"text":"So....for dinner tonight we decided on wings and tuned to Yelp to direct us to the best wings in the area. ATL wings was on the top of the list. My husband made the drive and came back with some DELICIOUS wings. He order mild, Cajun spicy and bacon cheddar (Yes, I said BACON CHEDDAR) and I have to say they were amazing. We will totally be returning for more wings. AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"I don't want to say how good this place is, I don't want it to get too crowded - but I should share.  I am a wing connoisseur, and I have to say, these wings are the best by far I have had in the valley!  And don't even get me started on the service.  It's an order at the counter place, but the person working the counter was the best ambassador for the place.  Welcoming, patient while we decided, gave us samples of sauces. Fantastic all around experience.  I can't wait to go back!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing wing flavor choices. The people are always friendly and courteous. I've turned tons of friends on to this joint. I'm back at least a time or two every month!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Honey biscuits are excellent as well. I had the citrus chipotle and Cajun hot wings and thought they were amazing.  Service was also very good, the ladies there were very nice and polite. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Wings are expensive and not that good!   Also,says on their menu that you get celery sticks with your meal and when we got home of course they weren't in there :-/"}
{"text":"Was craving good chicken wings tonight so took to Yelp when I came across ATL wings.  It is about 20 minutes away, but I decided to take the gamble and I'm glad I did.   I couldn't decide what seasoning I wanted so I got ATL style (after a sample....mmmmm), medium, citrus Chipolte and honey habanero.  All were delicious.  Also tried the fries, ATL Style, the spice adds a great flavor.  We then finished off the meal with the \"biscuits.\"  They are not traditional biscuits by any means, but oh are they delicious bites of doughy goodness!   If you are ever in the area I definitely recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"The boneless wings are small processed chicken nuggets and overpriced for that reason."}
{"text":"I decided to give ATL wings a go after searching Yelp for some good wings in the area.    The place is easy to find and provides a laid back atmosphere with TV's and plenty of seating.  It wasn't too busy when I arrived.  I walked right up to the only girl working the counter. I did notice two gentlemen behind her working the kitchen.    I ordered Mac n Cheese bites, Sweet Potato fries, and of course wings.  Chose to go with citrus chipotle and cajun hot.  The Mac n Cheese bites were good.  The sweet potato fries were good as well.  I don't have super high expectations for greasy food, so I can see why people would complain about the amount of grease, but its clear that these two items are both fried.  The flavor was enjoyable.  The wings are definitely some of the best I have ever had.  They are large with a good amount of meat.  The sauce isn't over powering and provided a great flavor.  The cajun hot seemed to have a dry rub mixed with a hot pepper sauce.  I can't wait to go back for more of these!  I ordered the kool-aid, of course.  Brought me back to childhood days.    The place seems to be a little under staffed at times.  I did notice a little lunch rush as I was eating, which caused a wait as the woman behind the counter ran food, refilled drinks, and took the orders."}
{"text":"Since the first time I stepped my foot in the door I was in love!! Chefs special is my main choice but lots of flavors that will have you excited about your next visit before you even leave. Two thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"Ok so wanted to try this place out since I heard they were really good so I did and man I should have gotten the whole scoop on how long there wings take. After 45 minutes I asked what was wrong with our order especially cause there was only three other customers in there the employee went ahead and told me they threw my wings away cause the other ones were too small. I was like really I would have taken it by the end of the hour we finally got our wings and compensated by giving me one wing extra. Needless to say we ended up going to another restaurant and getting served fast. Call ahead an hour and you'll be ok there wings are good but an hour for ten wings maybe not..."}
{"text":"Went and had dinner last night. Great wings and great company. Had some good wing discussions with one of the guys that worked there and he gave us a couple of samples since we were new and from out of town. I recommend going here if you want some good wings"}
{"text":"This place is FO Real! Finger lickin good. I'm on my way back."}
{"text":"Our first server was rude and gave an attitude while we were trying to order. The wings were smaller than expected and it was unreasonably dry."}
{"text":"The wings are delicious, try the lemon pepper. They have kool aid on tap, kool aid!!  They recently added baked beans, and they are so good. Saucy and sweet, and not too thick. This is the best wing place in the State!! Great atmosphere, clean, always buzzing with excitement. We always eat here, and are never going any where else for wings."}
{"text":"Tried ATL for the first time today. Tried Teriyaki and the Hot. Decent wings, a bit overpriced. Not my personal favorite. Still enjoy Oreganos or Buffalo Wild Wings over ATL."}
{"text":"Drop your lunch plans, and go here instead.   First, the wings are huge. Second, they are fried absolutely perfectly. Extra crispy skin, but the meat is juicy. The sauces are great as well.   Don't expect fine dining, but for what it is (a wing shop), it's the best you'll find."}
{"text":"Great customer service, great food. Best wings hands down. From my wife to her mom to all our friends, it's worth the drive from north Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic wings. We had the seasoned and the garlic parm which are both yummy. Nice wings with good meat on them and not fatty. The people were very friendly that work there and even gave us a sample of the honey biscuits! Great food and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great wings! As a Buffalo native, I've found my new favorite wing place. Thank you ATL!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in Chandler. Get the ATL style which is amazing. I'm from the South and this place gets chicken wings. The staff is always friendly too."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying how much I LOVE this place! Staff are always so friendly/welcoming right when I walk in! They are always on top of things esp the cashier. The food's amazing! Best wings and even koolaid around."}
{"text":"So this past Friday evening got me thinking wings. Turned to YELP and found ATL Wings. The reviews did not disappoint. Their wings are big, tender, flavorful and have a large variety of wing flavors. Also on the menu was Fried Catfish Dinner and other choices of plates. Next time I will check them out. The Kitchen is right behind the counter and it was hopping. This visit was all about the Wings. I had Seasoned and the Sweet 'n' Tangy for a side I had the Fried Okra. The Okra was Big Tender and even though fried, not greasy. The Wings were cooked nicely without being fried to death. Then coated in a bowl with the flavors.  The food was very good, and by the looks of the crowds customers all agree! I can see them outgrowing their location soon. I had Kool Aid to drink, Southern Style. The Kool Aid would make a Humming Bird very happy. Too sweet for my taste, but it is Atlanta Style Food. Overall the quality and variety of food was very good. Service was friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was like hanging with friends rather than a restaurant. I would recommend this place for anybody looking to get away from corporate crap bland wings. Maybe someday they will have a liquor license so we can get some nice cold beer to go with the wings ?   You will not be disappointed with this local Mom And Pop Shop!  Support your local Restaurants."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time the other day, the wings are awesome. Staff is really friendly. Koolaide is a plus. (The ranch wings are the best!)"}
{"text":"Cheese fries are great and the girl behind the counter is FFFFINE. The best meaty wings in all of Arizona, with a great variety of sauces and rubs. Always a good time. They only sell wings and they are delicious! We tried the honey BBQ and medium and loved both. You have to try the ATL fries too!"}
{"text":"Soooo good it made me sign up & open a Yelp account just so I can give this place a high five! They've mastered the art of perfect chix wing...the seasoning, sauce portion, that slight crunch. Num num! TIP: food is made to order, so be patient, you can't rush perfection...trust, it is so worth the wait. And get this...wonderful customer service! Their cust serv is a reflection of their confidence in their food, knowing they've got something special and their need to share that to the fine people of AZ. Like they knew we were in need of some good a$s wings! So good, i've nicknamed them 'Crack' wings... Cuz I always leave there feenin for more and usually go there 2 days in a row!"}
{"text":"Little bit of a wait but we had a big order. Always good. Oh yeah.   Kolaid is to sweet as well as the tea... Maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"ATL Wings 's, are second to none!  We drive there at least twice a week from Goodyear, which is over 25 miles each way. The service is superior, and thosebig, fat, juicy wings, with the different rubs and seasonings makes the trip all worth it. I never leave there unsatisfied. Don't forget to save some room for one of those delicious bu,ns, with honey, and confection sugar, they'll make you hurt yourself. Wash it all down with a variety of flavors of kool-aid.  Needless to say, this is my Top Pick in the Phoenix, and surroundi,g areas for wing, and they can have a 200 piece order ready to go in minutes, and it will be seasoned to perfection. All The Love Wings... I'm a loyal customer for life. Please open one up near Goodyear."}
{"text":"Great wings...once again Yelp did not let me down. Lots of variety. One caution-when the say spicy they mean spicy!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, the ATL style dry rub was delicious. Needing a key for an indoor bathroom was strange, but whatever. A 7-1£ min wait was actually refreshing as if they cooked the wings right then and there. Novel concept. I'd defintely go back."}
{"text":"I was craving some wings, so I thought I would stop in and give this place a try. I miss the old Louisiana Fried Chicken that used to be in this location...Stopped in and was looking over the menu, trying to decide which route to take.. The girl behind the counter asked if it was my first time there, to which I replied \"yes\". She then offered a sample. She brought me a wing \"ATL style\".. It was a dry rub as opposed to a sauce. Very tasty. Not spicy/hot, but great flavor. So, I decided to get 10 wings ATL style....  The wings here are not cheap...10 wings were $9.50. But they were big, juicy wings, cooked to perfection. The rub was flavorful, without the heat (or heartburn)..I will be back for more"}
{"text":"The staff at ATL wings Is always wonderful! I love the positivity and  genuine candor. I have eaten here a number of times and usually the food is great quality! Recently however the quality has taken a dive. The last time I visited the wings were not cooked properly, which resulted in them being a greasy meat pile.   I'll definitely give them another chance because the staff is delightful!"}
{"text":"Arrived in town on March 22.  I had a feeling this was a hot, new spot because a couple friends were checking in here 2-3 times a week.  My friend Michael T. mentioned we'd stop by when I got hungry.  It was a great way to end my first day in town.  I ordered the seasoned wings, sweet potato fries, and a grape Kool-Aid.  The wings were crispy, meaty, and seasoned perfectly.  You could tell they were cooked fresh.    The same could be said about the sweet potato fries.  They were fresh and crispy.  Washing that all down with grape Kool-aid just made everything better.  The Kool-Aid is a little spendy at $2.99, but you get free refills so drink away.  I will definitely be frequenting this place on a regular basis.  I'm looking forward to trying out the other wing flavors and other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Wings are delicious! I enjoyed the spicy ATL dry rub its pretty spicy but the flavor is great."}
{"text":"If you want wings, you have to try ATL. I was skeptical but after trying them Im hooked. The wings are not small, like say BWW. The sauces are amazing, love the Chipotle BBQ, but also the Lemon Pepper. Staff is great. Now a days I drop by take some home."}
{"text":"Great place when you want great wings and not a lot of frills or ambience. Carved out in a mostly empty strip mall area. But they are always busy.   So many favors to choose from, I think there are 18? You can't find that variety anywhere else. I'm always true to the honey BBQ whenever I order wings, and ATL does them well. Once I overheard someone at another table talking about the seasoned wings and how he orders them every time.   So, my next visit I tried the seasoned and WOW, they are good! Now I get them every time as well. I don't know what the seasoning is, but it is so good. I think they are dipped in butter too. Yummy! The great thing about ATL is that you can order your wings in different flavors in multiples of 6. Now I order 6 seasoned and 6 honey BBQ. Perfect.   I love the crispness of their wings and they are always piping hot to your table. I have had the special of six wings, fries and a soda for 6.99. Great value and the fries are good. I'm not too happy about their soda in cans. I'd rather have a fountain drink with ice. They do have KoolAid as an alternative though.   I couldn't give them 5 stars because my husband ordered chicken fingers as he doesn't like anything on the bone. they weren't anything special. It seemed like something they picked up at Costco. Not worth ordering again. But that is not their specialty...his loss, right?  It seems that every time I have been there that there is at least one person whom ordered to go and ended up pulling up to a table to eat because they just couldn't wait to dig in.   They are that good!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm Shocked how many people gave this place 5 Stars. They must not know what good wings or good fish taste like Or they work there and are putting up fake reviews.. The wings were not that bad not great but not bad. The fish I didn't want to eat the whole this way to salty no good favor just taste old and salty. For what you get I feel it's a little over priced but everywhere is getting to be like that. Will not go back again"}
{"text":"ATL Wings is probably in the top two or three for the east valley.  I can only think of one for sure that I do like a little better than ATL....  Pros Big Wings - Unlike the one biters at a local chain restaurant (that shall remain nameless), these wings are a good size.  In addition, it's all meat.... not that chewy junk you find at some places. Good Sauces - Their sauce and spices are good.  I've a had a couple of different flavors and was happy with them both.  Cons Price - A little bit expensive for wings.  I think 10 wings is around 9 bucks. Wait Time - I know people say they will wait for freshness... but dang! I'd recommend calling your order in.  It wasn't even overly busy when I went in, they are just very very slow in turning tickets."}
{"text":"2 things in this life I cannot stand it is Parmesan cheese and fish. I walked in one day excited to try something different. I ordered garlic pepper wings. I was served garlic parmesan by accident. Thank God that happened. They were delicious. On a second visit, I invited friends to join. One of them ordered catfish. They asked me to try it, which I replied no. After a while, peer pressure cracked me. Let's just say, next time I will be asking for their order of catfish... 14 flavors of wings, topped off with a side order of honey biscuits. Can't beat it! Thanks Mike for bringing ATL to the area!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars. Best wings hands down. Meaty, big, cooked perfect! Wet or dry rubs! I've tried them all! My favs are atl style and honey habanero. But you can't go wrong with any style here. Once you try these wings you'll never find better. I am a huge wing buff. I've had many from all around the valley and these are by far the best."}
{"text":"ATL wings are really good. Probably my favorite wing place in my area. Visit this location every now and again. Try their spicy ATL rub or extra honey habanero. Can't forget about the koolaid. One of the few places that offers that as a beverage choice."}
{"text":"Good wings shitty service, I was out on hold for 15 minutes just so they could hang up on me"}
{"text":"This was our first time to try ATL. It will be our last. Wings overcooked (skin was hard and crispy) and the seasoned fries limpy. Better wings at Wing Stop or Cogburns. The sauce choices were good as were the honey biscuits--could eat a meal of them."}
{"text":"First time visiting this afternoon. The staff was helpful and the prompt service was great! We definitely will be back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Wings are sides are amazing! But I give it a 3 because the never answer the phone when I need to order and pickup quickly"}
{"text":"Yelp, you came through for me again!  Stopped by right before closing and got a 10-piece of tangy-sweet chicken wings with blue cheese dressing.  The staff was friendly, and the interior was no-frills and clean.  The price was reasonable (much cheaper than BWW and FAR better food). The wings were crispy, juicy and succulent.  I could have eaten them all myself, but I shared with my cousin, who was also a fan.  The only area for improvement was the blue cheese dressing, which was on the thin side, and the celery pieces, which were wimpy (but still fresh).  I will definitely be returning in the future (cue ominous music)."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!!! I consider myself a wing conesuer. ATL wings are my ultimate favorite, nothing else like 'em!!! Many different flavors- I love the seasoned wings. Lets not forget the sides- my choice is spicy tots and onion rings with a large red kool aid!!! And if you have a sweet tooth you better have the honey biscuits too!!! I would like to add that the staff is awesome too!!!!  Enjoy your wings!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! C.C. has a great personality and I come back because of her... the foods a plus too!"}
{"text":"Wings were fantastic! Much recommended wing spot in Mesa...as well as the greater Phoenix Area! The wings were sauced perfectly, the wing size was also well portioned throughout my order! Medium and Garlic Parmesan bone-in wings were on point!!!! You want a wing better than Wing-stop, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Native, you ought to try ATL wings!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BOMB!  You haven't tried wings until you've tried these.  So many flavored, so little time!!  Favorite place."}
{"text":"Best wings in AZ as of now. I lived in Memphis and these are the closest there is in the 480/602!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in Phoenix! I tried it for the first time today and loved it!! AWESOME customer service and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab some awesome wings. I live about 10 miles away and I pass a dozen other wing places to get here but this place is so much better. We always get the plain \"Seasoned\" and the Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan every time plus a couple other flavors to try. Super friendly folks!  Update - I finally tried the catfish and it is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We could not have been more impressed! We rarely write reviews but we were so blown away that we had to ask names. Tasha was so friendly and sweet. And Mike, who offered us free wings to sample the incredible \"ranch\" wings (and they really were amazing!), is the owner! You will not only INHALE the awesome wings but feel so completely warm-welcomed!"}
{"text":"Do you know how hard it is to get real, authentic chicken wings?!  Look no further.  ATL Wings in Arizona, has got to be one the best chicken wing places I have had the pleasure of eating in a long time.  I am a total food snob. My job has allowed me to travel the world, so I know good food when I see and eat it.  OMG, first of all the service was exceptional.  The staff knew their sauces and their stuff.  The chicken was crispy and juicy.  I have never had wings were the rub was spicy, but the heat didn't keep you from eating more.  I couldn't put them down.  There were 4 of us in the party and we were all VERY pleased.  The owners, John and Keyona Thurman have a hit on their hands, bring that to Massachusetts, they don't know what they are doing...at all...KUDOS, Mr. and Mrs. Thurman...outstanding...the prices were also reasonable.  The food is just wonderful!"}
{"text":"I started using Yelp again just to say how amazing these wings are. These are hands down the best wings I've ever had"}
{"text":"The reviews are correct! The wings ARE amazing. What's NOT amazing is the hospitality of the owner. When my husband suggested she hire more register/phone help (we held for over SIX minutes to place our takeout order), she told him that the register/phone was her job and that's the way she did it. He said that he found her through Yelp and that all the reviews of the food were good, but he almost hung up and ate elsewhere. She flatly told him she didn't care about that. She had her repeat customers and they would come back not matter what. Sorry, not us."}
{"text":"Great place to get some wings and the seasoned fries are delicious. Nice eating environment, and the staff provided top notch service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go. My boyfriend and I only started coming here from a recommendation and now... We come here almost every Monday. I always get the Spicy Atl, Reg Atl, and my boyfriend gets the Honey Habanero. IT'S AMAZING. We also get he honey biscuits. It's a guilty pleasure, and it's to die for. It's soooooooooo goood! We used to go to Wingstop a lot but this is now our go to place. We will not go anywhere else. The service is always spectacular. The staff is friendly, talkative, and we can tell they they try to remember orders. They most definitely remember us when we come in. The wait ranges from 10-15 minutes. Maybe a little more but we never mind. The music is great, the place is clean, atmosphere is nice. We know good service, and good food can take time so we are patient. We've never had a bad experience. We live in Maricopa/Casa Grande and their food is worth the drive. Love it. Will be back almost every single Monday for as long as we live in AZ. (:"}
{"text":"There isn't much to say. Do you want good wings, cooked properly and as many flavors as you could possibly want? Gets a 5 star from me. Service was great but damn, those wings were massive and excellent. Props to the people who run ATL wings for going with such large pieces. They've made a loyal customer out of me."}
{"text":"I've loved wings since the day I came out the womb. I have been to a lot of places and have had lots of favorites in my 23 years of wing lovin, and I'll tell you what this is by far the best wing spot I have ever been too out of living in 5 different states. Amazing customer service, amazing workers, amazing wings. Please come open one in Orange County, CA. My life will be completed when that happens."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Went here last night with 8 ppl and got our orders right away!!! Staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"I really like this place because the staff are very friendly. They give samples and have all sorts of flavor. I love the ATL fries and the wings are delicious. I been here a couple of times and had not come across any bad services. 9/10 would recommend anyone who love wings to try this."}
{"text":"After my favorite wings place closed down (NY boyz subs n wings), I tried the next winner of the Wingstock challenge.  It's a little bit out of the way for me, but it was well worth the trip there.  The chicken is incredibly crispy and juicy, the mac and cheese bites are amazing. The jalepeno poppers were my least favorite (honestly, Jack in the box does it better), but the size of the jalepenos are hefty and well worth the price. The honey biscuits are the BEST, if I were to come back here again, I would come back for the honey biscuits rater than the wings. It was soft, sweet, hot and delicious.  It's a little bit on the expensive end, but it's a good alternative from places like hooters."}
{"text":"I usually order the lemon pepper wings and they always come out tasty. I also like the biscuits with honey and powdered sugar. They have never failed me. Service is always fast and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"It's true.  These wings are delicious!!!!  Look everyone, stop going to Wing-Mart, Wing King, and Wings R Us, and go to ATL Wings.  I started with the ATL dry rub wings.  Wow.  Here's how I describe them.  Cover a chicken in herbs and spices, roast it in a pan, then collect all the flavorful drippings in the pan.  Next, fry some wings until golden and crisp, and sauce them with those intense drippings.  I know, thats not how ATL Wings makes their ATL dry rub wings, but thats how they taste to me.  Excellent!!  Next I had the cajun BBQ sauced wings.  Watch out son!  These are vinegary, spicey, and bold.  Still nice and crispy, but covered in a sauce that'll make you slap your grandma. Superb.  You'll want some celery and ranch or bleu cheese as a counter punch.   This is a straight-forward, no frills joint.  They sell wings and thats about all.  If you like perfect wings, this is the place for you.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My favorite wing place In town!  We come every Tuesday for 65 cent wints!  Thats when its busy but you can't beat amazing wings at an awesome price on Tuesdays!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome at this location. Cashier was extremely friendly and helpful. There was limited seating and few guests finished up and left a table open. I asked employee if they could please clean it for us and she said of course and wiped it down a few moments later with a nice helpful smile. I made sure to drop a tip for them. Food here is also amazing, best wings in town, no competition. Fries are also perfect, thin, crispy, and flavorful. My wings go to spot hands down."}
{"text":"Chicken wings done right! Kool Aid on tap, 3 flavors. No waiting. Clean eating area. Mild for the kids. You will feel this place!"}
{"text":"Went with a coworker and would have to say these are some of the most fire wings in town. The flavor selection is expansive. I ordered 12 boneless with half atl spicy and the other honey habanero. They came within 5 minutes steaming hot but there were traditional. I told the cashier and 12 more boneless came right away. My coworker and i split them and were blown away by the honey hab..its so good! I actually liked the traditonal more than the boneless and cant wait to go back again. Great food, spectacular service, and koolaid on TAP!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings, great service .. I am from NY this is my 1st review and these wings are great !!! They give complementary taste test .. The spicy if you like spice are excellent ... Ooo and did I mention kool-aid on tap !!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 10 piece traditional.... Wings were served ice cold and all drums........"}
{"text":"I heard ATL Wings had many dry & wet wing varieties and was great.  So, made a trip there and found out they have awesome wings.  I like the hot, dry wing types.   My wife likes the mild wings.  Since that first trip, we've tried several different types.  Even called in a take out for 8 doz one time. And the shoestring fries (seasoned or unseasoned) are great too.  Each batch of wings is made once you order (never precooked).  So you know they are fresh.  The only issue is that the place is small.  They need to find a bigger location. and serve beers.  Still, the best wings place in the East Valley."}
{"text":"The wings were delicious; nice and crispy and full of flavor! The bacon cheddar fries were crazy good. Fries with Alt seasoning were good too. Fries were large portions so recommend sharing."}
{"text":"The wings are great (period) We no to another place the day before and was thoroughly disappointed. Wanted wings again and while heading to Wingstop I spotted this place. The fries are crazy good too."}
{"text":"First review I have ever done. I was looking for places to order wings and someone recommended ATL Wings. I've tried calling at least 4 times and no one has picked up so I could place an order. Why put up a phone number if no one is going to answer? Can't comment on the rest of the service since I was never able to get in contact with anyone."}
{"text":"Outstanding wings including a wide variety of flavors.   A family owned restaurant that truly cares for their customers.   They questioned whether they had provided me with wings flavored accordingly and brought out another dozen for free!  Very impressed with their focus on their customers!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab some wings and beans and bacon Love It way better than the one on Thomas we will be spending a lot of money here wings were so crispy perfect no gummy skin at all and we did take out and the wings were still crispy when we got home see you soon"}
{"text":"The food here was great, but the cleanliness of the restaurant left a lot to be desired. It sounded like they were short staffed the day I went in, but cleanliness in a restaurant should be top priority. I ordered boneless wings and fries with the ATL seasoning. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review off by saying. I love ATL wings. I drive from Surprise to the location on 51st Ave anytime I want wings.   First and last visit at this location at around 7:30 pm. I had family come in town and this location was the closest from the airport. When we arrived the place was a wreck. There was garbage on all the tables and the floors had all sorts of stuff on it. I immediately turned around and headed back outside and then the party I was with stated they were really hungry and tired from the travel. We decided against better judgement to stay and eat.   We approached the counter and the out of towers was advised they could not sample the sauce. We then were advised to buy a wing. We were confused and said never mind. At this time another guy approached the counter and said wait we will let you sample it on a wing. There were 6 people who had never visited this place. He gave us 2 wings.   The total number in our party was 15 people. We reviewed the menu and when we went back to start placing the order we were advised they only had 50 wings. I asked a simple question to the cashier guy. I said when I initially came to the counter I asked you how many sauces could I pick for the 96 wing combo. I stated you advised me any way I want to split it up you could do it.  I said so if you didn't have 96 wings that would have been a great time to state we normally could split them up anyway you like but currently we don't have 96 wings. I asked if he agreed and his response was he forgot. At this point I said fine give me all you have. I then asked for 5 orders of cheese fries to which he replied he was out of those as well. I am really annoyed by now. I ask if there is anything else he is out of he states no. I then ask for fried biscuits and then he states oh we are out of those too I am so sorry. I ask if he has boneless wings he states yes I attempt to order the amount I need he says I only have 10. I say fine I attempt to order salad which they are out of as we'll. At this point someone yells fro the fryer we have some fries. I am heated an state just give me what you have. To get to the point besides the horrible service the food was horrible. They were apparently running low or out of the ATL sauce which was the majority flavored we ordered. The wings and fries were overcooked. The boneless wings were undercooked and under sauced. The flavors we ordered were messed up as well.   Another note we were all sitting at the tables ready to eat when they brought the food over in bags and advised that they were closing soon. The hours state they close at 9 pm. I am assuming since they were out of food they were closing early. I advised ok but we will be dining in since there is over an hour left to closing. While we are attempting to consume this inedible stuff they served us people we notice they are frying chicken and the workers appear to be packing food up. Customers are coming in and placing orders and getting upset when they say they have no wings. One man came in and asked well what is he frying if they are out of wings? The guy stated I don't know I said we were out and the customer began to tell them they were ghetto amongst other things to which one of the guys at the fryer (who was obviously frying more wings I guess for him to take home for himself) replied he was from Compton crip life threw up some sign and told him to meet him on the side of the building. He told the man he was going to beat his donkey( he's used the other A word). The man stated lets go female dog and exited the restaurant and the worker left out of the back door at this point we packed up quickly and left.  I will never ever eat here again. The service the food was horrible and obviously they had more wings but just decided they didn't want to serve the customers."}
{"text":"Fresca the cashier needs a reminder to not argue with the customers when they say she didn't ring up the order correctly."}
{"text":"This is a great wing place if you are in the Chandler area.  The have a steady business, and the key is the sauce.  They have a ton of sauces to choose from.  The two I tried were Honey Habanero and Citrus Chipotle.  Both are bright and have a good flavor.  The honey sauce is nice and sweet with a touch of heat, similar in consistency to a teriyaki sauce but with much better flavor.  They also have a very moist lemon cake, which is nice for summer.  The red lights are a unique touch.  This place is a local diamond in the rough for wings, and I would recommend everyone to stop by and grab some."}
{"text":"Called 13 times just to place our order! When we got home only had half the order and now they won't answer the phone to get a darn refund"}
{"text":"ate wings from here for the first time last night. 10 piece hot was really really good recommend this place to every"}
{"text":"Oh my where do I start!! To begin with you are treated with lovely customer service, and a very homie vibe!! The young gentle men that works In the back treated us very well!! wings are amazing, I recommend the ATL Spicy, or chef special it's the bomb!!! It does get packed, but you can always call in!! The wing Has so much flavor to it, it's ridiculous lol! You must try!!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings. Had wings at Duff's and Anchor in Buffalo, NY. This place got them beat!!! Honey BBQ, Honey Habanero, and ATL dry rub were simply awesome. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer however the service here has been worse and worse. Tried to call in a to go order and was on hold for over 10min. So I hung up and called back the woman excuse was she had other customers to deal with. No apologies nothing but a rude defensive attitude.  I told her I was a paying customer as well and they just lost one. Ordered from Wing Stop where I felt like a valued customer no wonder they've been in business for years. The 2 stars is for the tasty wings only."}
{"text":"The biscuits smothered in honey...order them first and IMMEDIATELY!! I ate 3 and went to heaven  The wings were big plump & juicy..amazing flavors btw. We tried honey BBQ, honey habanero, and chefs choice.. Ohmgawdddd, heaven I tell you!!!   WINGSTOP  is complete TRASH  next to this amazing gem. It's probably going to be crowded as hell, but you will live and be happy you waited & don't forget the biscuits!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wanna get down with the most delish wings in AZ?  Chef special was the way to go.  Biscuits.  All I can say is biscuits."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service sucks...I don't know how else to put it. It's not worth it for me to go in there and wait while everyone in the back are on their phones and playing around. I understand you want to work in a fun environment, but when it affects the service, cut it out. Not to mention the environment is undesirable from a cleanliness standpoint...guessing they wouldn't do well with a surprise visit from a health inspector. Lost a customer here."}
{"text":"Wings where pretty good but nothing to write home about.  I got medium traditional wings and they where about what you expect. Hard fried.  Wife got boneless wings and while the sauce was good the size was disappointing. They where nugget sized.  The fries where awesome. We got the regular fries and loved them.  Overall good just disappointed with the size of the boneless wings."}
{"text":"Called in for to go order. The lady who answered the phone was not willing to help and was rushing. I have never eaten here and was really excited to try. I called in to place order to go and I asked which flavor was most well known or popular but the lady told me to just come in and try sample. She also told me that the to go orders don't go in until I pay for it at the store (then what is the purpose of to-go)."}
{"text":"Amazing experience the food was delicous. It was a welcoming and up beat enviroment. Loved it"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service was great. I will be back!  Didn't believe that there would be a substantial difference in wings. This place proves there is, and still affordable. Great value for the money."}
{"text":"Here's something that doesn't happen every day, especially in what might be considered  a competitive market... Time: 7:36pm on a Saturday night. A couple of friends and I decide, \"Let's get some wings!\" I have had ATL before from a different location. The Goldwater store is about 12 minutes away, versus 20+ to the Phoenix location. So I called to place an order. A young lady answered, \"ATL wings, Please hold.\" Three minutes later, nothing. Wow, we figured, they must be busy.  Tried again. Same response and onto immediate hold. 6 Minutes later, nothing. Now, that's a bit ridiculous... Let's try again. Same answer, same young woman, followed by the casting forth into hold purgatory. 13 minutes. Nothing. Not even crickets. This was a telephonic Black Hole from which neither gravity nor light could escape, much less an order of ATL Wings (Hot). So now we're just stunned. I called Long Wongs and placed an order for 50 wings. Total time: 3 minutes. Ready in 20.  So I called back to ATL, (Time: 8:06) asking for the same young woman not to put me on hold AS she answers. Click... vooooooiiiiiiiiddddddddddddddd. And now I am finally just PO'd. At that moment I determine I will call every 30 seconds until someone actually TAKES the phone call. Again, \"ATL Wings. Please....\" at exactly the same moment I literally screamed: \"WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR MANAGER?\" The answer: \"Whaaaat?\" Repeat the question. Answer: \"Nicole.\" Is she there this evening? \"No.\" I then ask the $64,000 question: \"Do you realize you have put me on hold multiple times for over 20 minutes?\" And here comes the kicker... Her answer: \"There are only two of us working tonight and we are really very busy. You can come into the store if you want to place an order.\"  No apology. Just a remarkable mea culpa as can only be offered by someone who flatly could not give a [Fill in the Blank] about me, my order or my money. I tell her that what she is doing is just NOT the way to conduct business and ask if Nicole will be in Monday. \"She should be.\" Well, I'll be talking to her on Monday about this, I say. Her response: \"Whatever.\"  By the way, the wings from Long Wongs on Thomas, just west of Scottsdale were fantastic. And the service was excellent. And worth every penny of the $50 we spent."}
{"text":"This is a good place for wings, I'm from NY and spent some time in Buffalo, where I came to love Duffs and Anchorbar, this place doesn't have the perfect sauce figured out, but they do have the perfect cook time on the wings.   Also they have Kool-Aid, so that brings you back to the good ol' days of being a kid and coming inside from playing on a hot sunny day."}
{"text":"The food taste really good! I ordered the Cajun BBQ, and Cajun hot.  The place looks a little messy, but the food makes up for it haha.  The pricing is normal considering chicken wings cost 90 cents a piece, if you order fries or a side with the chicken you'll get a free soda drink.  Every time I come here I always spend around $11-15."}
{"text":"I am honestly surprised how many good reviews this place had. I wish I would have taken pictures of our food and the restaurant. I think this is the first time my husband and I have walked out of a restaurant after having a few bites of food. It just wasn't worth us forcing ourselves to eat a horrible meal. I think the topper to the meal was the dead cockroach on the floor by our table. Not even he liked it!  Lol. Our wings and fries were so greasy. We took the wings out of the tray and put them on a paper towel to soak up the grease. They were tasteless as well. I should have asked for my money back - but decided to leave our trays full of food on the table. The staff was nice, but that is the only nice thing I can say about ATL wings."}
{"text":"We've had a couple of Wing Summit meetings here and they don't disappoint. The staff is always awesome and it's not because we had them drop 90 wings.  But they're pleasant, helpful and patient when dividing up that many flavors.  We'll be back and be back often."}
{"text":"Probably the best, meaty chicken wings I've had in a long time.  The mild wings were just spicy enough that I could gorge myself with no pain!  Next time I will go hotter but will probably limit the amount I eat    Tuesdays are .75 wing night. Not a bad deal."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. The assistant manager first held the line up flirting with some guy, ordering for a party of 8. His order was submitted 2 minutes before mine. 30 minutes go by so I ask how long until my 12 wings, 1 side of fries, and buffalo chicken salad are ready and the young girl taking orders tells me they hadn't even started it yet!! So 10-15 more minute go by and they finally bring my food out, and the chicken wings are lukewarm at best. The young girl apologizes for the wait and I ask for a side of ranch to make up for it- she tells me I have to pay 75 cents. Then I tell the assistant manager the wings are cold and that id like to send them back and just eat my salad and fries. She tells me she won't refund just the wings and that it is all or nothing. I told her I wanted a refund and wanted to at least eat the fries that I waited 40 minutes for and she refused. She sent her cook out to retrieve my food, but at that point I had left it all on the counter and never got a refund. I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I have somewhat of an understanding of how this business should operate, and I am completely blown away by how I was treated."}
{"text":"Petty good wings and absolutely love that they aren't breaded. I had the Cajun hot. Just enough heat and spices. Can't wait to come back and ck out more of their flavors."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! I love lemon pepper wings and this place could easily put Wingstop out of business. I just wish they offered delivery:("}
{"text":"I liked the thickness of the sauce and the crunch of the wings. The wait time was extremely long, it took us 27 minutes to get our wings."}
{"text":"A friend of mine at work has been talking about ATL Wings as the best place for wings in the valley. Today she brought some ATL style wings back to the office to share, and from the first bite I was blown away! Amazing flavor, great texture, plenty of meat on the bones. I loved it so much I went back for dinner tonight. I'll definitely be back to try more of the flavors."}
{"text":"I'm SO BUMMED!  I just confirmed that they recently changed their boneless wings.  They USED to be 5 stars - best boneless wings I had ever had - now they just remind me of grocery store frozen chicken nuggets :-(  They're all uniform size/shape now (used to look just like they took a large drumette and pulled the bone out, which was SO good!) and we found that too many of them had bits of gristle in them now.  My husband loves their bone-in wings, but me and the kids really prefer boneless, so unfortunately this is no longer a choice for family dinners out.  Their sauce is great, fries are excellent and the staff is really friendly, but it's HUGE disappointment that we've lost our favorite boneless wing place!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best wings and service I ever had Kool aid on tap  atl wings come to Boston I'm in love.  Clean place fast service what more can u ask for..great job staff give them a raise also dessert is a must have honey powder costs biscuit yum yum"}
{"text":"Just found this place because of reviews on yelp.  If you are looking for excellent wings, this is the place to come.  We ordered both boneless and bone-in wings.  2 of us loved the bone-in the other liked the boneless.  A little pricey but oh so worth it.  Their chef special sauce is unbelievably good.  The meat is crispy which to me is perfection.  I have eaten a lot of \"steamed\" wings and for me, that's just disgusting.  These will rock your world if you want fantastic wings.  We will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Great wings, and variety of sauces. Make sure to try the seasoned fries!!  Bathrooms could use a little work but overall would recommend ATL wings."}
{"text":"The ATL wings are very good. The dry rub wings I get every time never fair me. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I am visiting Phoenix and had a craving for wings. So based on the reviews I chose this place and it didn't disappoint. The wings were large and they were cooked right. You have a choice of sauces and I chose the Cajun Hot since it was the hottest. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the Cajun hot sauce was not all that hot, but I do have a high tolerance for spice."}
{"text":"I've been passing ATL Wings on my trips around Chandler and the bright red logo certainly caught my eye. I'm always up for a new wing experience so on a Friday afternoon I stopped in.   This cafeteria style eatery is bright and cheery and immaculate. The interior graphics certainly lend to the unique flavor of the place and full view of the clean and well lit kitchen assure you that this place values their equipment and the product they turn out. Two things I liked about the menu right away were the variety of wing flavors and the reasonably priced wing amounts you are able to order. You can get anywhere from a ten piece order on up to orders for huge party. Plus, they had no problem splitting the ten piece wing order we had into 2 different flavors.   They don't only sell wings either. I had some of the best fried catfish I've had in years and the portions are huge. The catfish came with fires and cole slaw and these side orders were excellent as well. Plus I had some fried okra and it was done very well. I could taste the okra and there was a slight spicy flavor but the breading wan't overpowering and the okra wasn't soggy. Back to the catfish... it was flaky and delicious, again not rubbery or overdone. I suspect they use fresh catfish and bread the orders as they come in and don't use frozen prefab stuff. It was great!  The gal at the desk taking orders was extremely friendly and helpful and advised on the order so we could get what we wanted and made suggestions. The place had steady business and there were a lot of phone in orders coming in and being picked up but she was smooth sailing all the way. This is a family business and you can tell they are proud of what they do and the food they offer.   For a ten piece order of wings, a side of fries, a 2 piece catfish meal with fries and coleslaw and a side of fried okra plus a soda it was 23 bucks. That's more than reasonable for the amount of food and the QUALITY of food we received. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I placed a large order had to go inside and place to go order because no one Ever picks up the phone. Then i get home and see i did not get my honey biscuits. Which is main reason i went lol. And since no one every answers and they are not close to me i wasted $5 just because."}
{"text":"First time here and a guy from Charlotte NC told me about it. First class product, first class service. The establishment is extremely clean and they have pride in what they do. I have never tasted wings like this ever!  The flavors are incredible! A lot of restaurants need to take lesson on the fries here. They are amazing.  Keep up the good work and God Bless this place."}
{"text":"Wow went here for the first time and I have to say that we loved the wings. We were able to get three flavors with an order of 36 wings, this of course was awesome because we got to try different ones and see which one we liked best. We loved them all and my husband who is a wing addict says this is his favorite wing place now. They have kool-aid which I loved and the customer service was great. I can't wait until we can go back and enjoy more flavors!"}
{"text":"Went for first time and had ATL spicy and honey habenero, delicious. Service was fast food hot, everything was good with the exception of the fries, could use a little work.... taste like they have been cooked earlier and then recooked, and supposed to be seasoned. Will visit this spot again to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Customer service is out of this world, the wings are amazing....that's all I need!!!   I will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't rated this before.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here.  Kool-aid on tap!   NOM!    I do have to say that I don't eat wings, but my bf does EVERYWHERE and this is one of his faves.  His 7 year old said they have the best food she's had anywhere!  She is a picky little princess too!  I get to nosh on all of the other deliciousness they offer... try them all!    We will be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Bomb! I wanted to go to Hooters all you can eat wings Wednesdays but my more conservative friends talked me out of that...so we ended up trying out this gem for the first time.  Man it was delicious.  Very fresh wings, crispy, and the sauces were delicious.  I thought the customer service was above and beyond what we expected.  We were debating what sauce to choose so the staff made us a sample of the wing flavor for us without us even asking.  Now onto the wings.  I ordered the honey habanero and the chef's special with ranch and blue cheese.  All really good, and their dressings are delicious! My friends ordered the cheese fries and the honey cinnamon rolls. They loved them (I didn't try them).  So these wings were so good I ended up going back that same week by myself and ordering takeout. You know food is really good when you go to a place twice in one week and alone lol it's just u and the food.   This time I ordered half hot and half parmesan garlic.  Both really good again.  As I am writing this, I wish they were open so I could go there again. Go try these wings.  They are finger licking good!"}
{"text":"It was not good at all. I ordered 4 different types of wing flavors and seasoned French fries. They packaged them in a plastic container with a plastic lid. By the time I got home everything was super gross and soggy. The fries were too Salty I can barely eat them and the Parmesan and garlic wings were super soggy and not at all crunchy. I was disappointed after all the wonderful reviews."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings in town. The service was A M A Z I N G! The food was 10/10. Had the hot and ranch wings, the seasoning on the fries made my mouth water. Everything went great and I will definitely make another stop soon!"}
{"text":"My 2nd week in a row and first time was no fluke.  I tried them for the first time last week and I was even more impressed this time. They have the best chicken wings in town!  Its a bold statement, cause I consider myself a Chicken wing eating expert!  I've sampled wings from all across the US and this place is one of my favorite ever, let alone in Phoenix.  They do it right.  It's a wing place, everything else is secondary.  This time around I ordered the 36 piece wings, 18 buffalo medium, extra saucy and I had 9 ATL style and 9 honey habanaro.  The wings were big, meaty and very flavorful.  Also ordered some fries ATL style and came with a free drink.  I invited couple of buddies over for the games yesterday and they were thoroughly impressed as well.  It was a little drive for me, but its well worth it.    Best Wings in Phoenix area-  I promise you that!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we are from buffalo NY, where they have perfected wings.  My husband and I have been here a few times. We did order out once and ate in a few times. The first few times it was pretty good. I wish they had a sauce for the garlic option, but the dry rub isn't bad.  Today we went and got 18 boneless wings. We did garlic parmesan, honey habanero and sweet and tangy. We couldn't tell the difference between the sweet and tangy and the honey habanero. Neither were that spicy and we were kind of disappointed today. It seemed greaser then usual and just over all not that great.  If I would have done the review before today I probably would have done 4 stars.  My husband who ranted and raved about this place before, said today that he didn't want to go back after that."}
{"text":"Wow, very good place for wings. Cooked fresh and my wait time was less then 10 minutes with people ahead of me. I tried there home made blue cheese dipping sauce and it was so good. I don't even like blue cheese. I will be back."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service. The worst I've had in the East Valley in 20 years of living here. Go to The Reef across the street, the wings are just as big and tasty and the service is fine, (it's a really divey bar, you probably should get em to go, just sayin)"}
{"text":"Went to try this place based on a friends recommendation. We had honey habanero (bone-in) and ALT boneless wings and honey biscuits. The wings were really good. Not the best I've ever eaten in my life but still very good and we will definitely come back again. The honey biscuits are like big greek loukoumades. Definitely not what I had pictured in my mind when I ordered them but it was a pleasant surprise. A friend ordered the cheese fries and said they were also very good. Only dinged one star because we called in the order and were told 10 minutes, didn't show up till about 15 minutes after I called and still had to wait 5-10 minutes for the food. The lighting is kind of weird (all neon red) so I recommend ordering take out unless you fancy everything looking red when you eat. :)"}
{"text":"been eating wings my whole life in Phoenix and if you think long wongs is good (I think mediocre) ATL wings presented me with the BEST wings I have ever had in my life. better than Uncle Sam's better than zipps golden blows the major chains out of the water... better than anything I can think of or remember. every spot of the wings covered in sauce and crispy in every bite. glad I live close to this spot."}
{"text":"holly big wings these were super good service was on point will be back very soon get a side of baskets so good"}
{"text":"These wings are very impressive, a lot of chicken on the bone and awesome flavor. Had the bacon cheese fries, and they sure hooked it up with the bacon! That was awesome but the fries were a little soggy. Also had the house salad not that great but we mainly went in for chicken anyway.. The customer service was good, definitely going back for the wings!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 2 years or so and the food is great, but the customer service and amount of time waiting is unacceptable. I tried calling in on a Friday night for a to-go order, but the line was busy every time I tried calling. So I'm here waiting for six traditional wings and I've been here for almost an hour. I'm not the only one either... everyone in the restaurant looks hungry and tired of waiting.   ATL staff: get your shit together if you want to stay in business. All it takes us one new joint around the corner to put you down. Don't take your great business for granted."}
{"text":"Great customer service and very clean interior. It was our first time in there and they allowed us to sample the sauces so we would be happy with our choice. The Ranch wings were delicious and the honey mustard wings had the perfect amount of sweet & tang. They have Kool Aid and it was so good! The only disappointment was the rolls with honey and powdered sugar. They were dry on the inside and all of the honey leaked and sitting at the bottom of the bag. We'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite wing place until today.  I called to place an order for take out and no one answered. I drove to the store and let the lady taking orders know that no one is answering the phone. She looked at me like she could care less and said nothing. NOTHING. Then I asked if there was any specials today and she said  \"No\". I waited for her to tell me when there were specials . There was an awkward silence and then she finally said, \"Specials are on Tuesday\" in a very monotone voice.  There was no greeting, no thank you, no smile, no ANYTHING.  I asked about the Chefs Special sauce that's listed under the HOT flavors and asked her how hot was it. She said, \"It's not hot\". (monotone again) WHY IS IT LISTED UNDER THE HOT SAUCES THEN?!?! And in the end, when my order was ready, she said my name and walked away. WOW! Lady, you've worked here a long time and your customer service skills went from a 10 to a ZERO! The folks at the east Mesa store are great. This one has gone to shit and I will not be back."}
{"text":"We passed by this place all the time on our way home or out somewhere else.  Had a craving for wings and to try a new place and decided to give it a try.  So glad we did because it's our favorite wing place now.  The staff is great and the wings are just so great.  Our favorites are the ATL style wings, honey habanero, and the mild."}
{"text":"This location just opened up. I've been a fan of this place since visiting their Thomas Rd location in Phoenix a while back. Staff is friendly. Very happy to have them in the West Valley!!! If it's your first time, they will offer a sample of any flavor to help you decide."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is absolutely terrible. The cashier was extremely rude, as a business you should care about your customers. Treat your customers bad and that's bad business. Simply \"treat others the way you'd like to be treated.\" I asked a simple question to the girl and she replied so rude. Then I picked up my food from the counter, I say thank you and she rudely says \"go out that door\" I just know there's no there's no reason for all the rudeness. I'm supporting a business that doesn't care about the people who keep it"}
{"text":"Great menu. Great service. Clean. Prompt. Extremely friendly. Owner interacts with customers to insure satisfaction with service & meal. They have sweet potato fries! They have a mean fried biscuit served with powdered sugar or cinnamon that is to die for that surprisingly complemented the wings."}
{"text":"This is a excellent place if you love wings!! Great flavor and the environment reminds me of a home BBQ. Great music, atmosphere and service. What better way to make your meal complete."}
{"text":"The wings here are cooked perfectly and have that good crisp bite you want in a good wing. Fries are good but the biscuits are a must order put the honey syrup and powdered sugar toppings on them!"}
{"text":"As a first timer, wings were good but customer service not so much. Cashier was not friendly and didn't ask what kind of sauces we wanted or anything. Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Still amazing. I turned my whole office onto the wings! We order out once a week. Some office favorites include: Cajun BBQ and Teriyaki. Ranch is still my go-to.  Their fries are great, too."}
{"text":"Best wings in Arizona.  Wings are the size of chicken thighs!   They offer 18 different flavors.   My favorites are garlic parmesan, seasoned, lemon pepper, garlic pepper, & cajun.  I know, that's practically the whole menu....  ;)  Don't forget about their honey biscuits...  BOMB.COM"}
{"text":"Everyone else here touting how amazing the wings are, they're spot on.  Decent prices. Nice staff. Great food.  The only thing that I'd change is that they don't have a soda fountain. They do have 3 koolaid fountains, which may or may not tickle your fancy.  I like blue."}
{"text":"The. Best. Boneless Wings. I have ever had.  Seriously. I don't know how they do it but I am ADDICTED to ATL's perfect boneless wings. They're juicy and flavorful on the outside, just the right kind of crunch on the outside! Never dry or frozen-tasting. Their honey BBQ is great. Their fries are just okay--something about them feels limp and anemic--but the honey donuts are AMAZING. I love ATL holy sh*t.   The staff is also always warm and friendly. I come back a lot and I have never once seen them be unprofessional, rude, or inattentive. They seem happy to be there! This is a gem and I hope it gets more attention in the Chandler area, because it deserves it."}
{"text":"Best wings in town! You won't be disappointed. They are cooked to perfection and the flavors pop in your mouth."}
{"text":"Fast & friendly service. I ordered traditional hot wings and they were amazing. Also got the bacon cheese fries YUM. I'm very happy I now live super close to this location, I'll be back for sure  !!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get wings if you like a variety of flavors. I tried doing a phone order at this location once though and they didn't answer; going in and waiting was inconvenient but overall worth it"}
{"text":"1st time here today, ladies up front gave me samples of sauces to try.  Service is beyond great, both ladies at counter super sweet and very friendly from the minute I ordered until I left ATL. Wings are EXCELLENT and on point, fries good too!  I will be back. Hope they open one up in the west valley so my family and I can visit :)"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had so far in Phoenix, and i've been on a hunt to find a go-to spot.  Decent price, fries are annoying just because some are very short, then the next will be super long, but just grab a handful, dip em in ranch, shove em in your mouth and you won't be disappointed. The chefs special sauce and ATL style are my favorites so far. definitely will be back to try more! They cook to order, and getting a carry out takes me about 13 minutes to get home, nothing gets soggy, still hot and crisp! Give ATL a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"For sure my new favorite wing place. Everyone was so nice and helpful and we got offered a sample of a flavor we were curious about. I thought we would get to try just the sauce but I got an actual big wing with the sauce which was a pleasant surprise. Our food came out really fast and it was all great. The spicy ATL wings are so good, I'm usually more of a sauce person then rub but I highly recommend. All the food I got was good,  no complaints. Thanks guys for the delicious good and great hospitality!"}
{"text":"Very good crisp on these wings. I ordered the atl rub style wings with fries and a blue raspberry kool-aid and it definitely hit the spot. The food was cooked to order so you gotta wait a minute but not long. Fries were fresh and wings were perfect. I will be heading back here again for sure."}
{"text":"The wings here are amazing! I ordered the spicy atl wings and honey chipotle, both were juicy and crispy! Also got the biscuits with all the trimmings offered and one of the best biscuits I've ever had! This place also has kool-aid on tap! I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some good wings and ice cold kool-aid!!! Give it a try, you'll love it!!! Customer service was excellent! Food served hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had (wing connoisseur)!!! Smackiest lemon pepper I've ever had!!!! Music is always on point, customer service is great!!! That ATL seasoning is something else! The only thing is you HHAAVVEE to clarify if you want all flats... maybe twice... but definitely a continuous comeback!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd be shocked if there was a better wing place in AZ. The wings are out of this world. So are the honey biscuits. The prices are good too. Yes, there is a wait for your food. But I have no problem waiting for food prepared only AFTER I've ordered it. The honey habanero are the best. So are the garlic parm. You can tell they actually make their own sauces and don't just pour a bottle of who knows what on the wings. This place is worth the money and the wait. Seriously, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good food. But even more impressive was Stephanie's service! Visited ATL Saturday with a group of four and Stephanie was incredible. What was more impressive was that although it was 10 minutes before closing Stephanie still had great energy and her staff were on it. They gave us great recommendations and food came out fast. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will def visit ATL again."}
{"text":"This ATL location is down the street from my work, so I'm here at least once a month for lunch. The food is just as good here as the other locations, and I actually think they get everything out quicker here even during the lunch rush. My go to order is a 10pc traditional (half/half split of flavors depending on what I'm feeling that day) and a side of ATL fries. Wings are always crispy, cooked and sauced well, and pretty meaty compared to other places. The fries are awesome, some slightly crispy while others are slightly soft, and the seasoning that goes on the ATL fries is so good that I don't need to dip them in anything."}
{"text":"This location has the best wings! The customer service is always really friendly and helpful. I really enjoy going here great food and amazing service."}
{"text":"I LUV WINGS ~ ATL has has some of the best. We tried out their Extreme Mango Habanero and their Spicey ATL Dry Rub. Both were crazy good. Crispy on the outside, moist & meaty on the inside. We also got an order of Cheese Fries, and I kid you not, probably the best fries I've ever tasted. This was our first time here, but you can bet, it won't be our last !"}
{"text":"I went back here again last night .  I ordered the catfish dinner and got two hand breaded fillets of fresh catfish that was perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious. It was served with fries and only $8.99. It was the best fried fish I have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have only a few things on the menu and it's all ridiculously good! That's how you know a place is great. 1st time there they gave me a sample and that's when I decided I'm going to try everything on the menu. Last time I got 1 order of biscuits and that was a mistake. I need like 10. 1st time was a couple months ago and I've been there several times since and just happen to be craving it now, so decided to write the review. The staff is fun and always excited to help you. The wings are the best in the valley, I especially like their ATL wings. Hands down favorite wing spot ever!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great sauces/rubs! It got a little pricey (the sole reason behind 4 stars). I found myself needing to buy several orders of wings to be full. Ended up coming out to about $16/person.  The chef's special and spicy atl were my favorite flavors. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"So, here's the deal, I'm a pretty tough critic when it comes to wings. I've been a lot of places and have eaten a lot of wings and feel like I know a pretty good wing when I come across one. That being said I really didn't have very high expectations for ATL because it was a referral. Not only was I pleasantly surprised at the taste and texture of the wings but it met my standards for sure. I had the dry rub and my son had BBQ style neither disappointed. Great seasonings, spices and the ATL sauce was not to tangy but savory to say the least. Washed it all down with Grape Kool Aid, that's right I said Kool Aid needless to say that it took me back to the my old neighborhood when Mami cooked rice & beans with a cup of the Grape to help wash it down. ATL is a clean and inviting spot with friendly employees. I approve! Thank you ATL."}
{"text":"Best boneless wings you can eat. Big chunks of white meat cooked to perfection. Tossed in the best sauces around. To be honest, better than all the BBQ joints in the Phoenix area. This place is killer and the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Best hot wings I've ever had. Great price. Small little joint to go to with a small group of friends. The flavor of the hot sauce is so scrumptious. Wings are always piping hot and fresh with the perfect crisp to sauce ratio."}
{"text":"I have been here 3x...1st bad experience.  Yesterday, I had about 20 minutes to order and take-out.  After waiting waiting as the #2 customer in line for close to 15 minutes, I had to disappointedly leave with an empty stomach. They take there time in cooking orders and seemed to forget or take for granted the many customers waiting.   Their food is great and fresh, they need to be more customer attentive and timely in taking orders.   Disappointed at the lack of customer care, I'm rating 1 star for service."}
{"text":"Awesome wings, very meaty. Sauce is boss! Typical fast food atmosphere. Love it!"}
{"text":"The wings are big and pretty good. Based on how fast I got my order the wings are probably pre-cooked. I say this because they are not juicy but dry. I wouldn't order there hot unless you really really like hot. There medium traditional are plenty hot but tasty. Lemon pepper are good but again...dry, not juicy."}
{"text":"The textute on the wings are soo good as well and the sauce is sooo good ke and my girlfriend have been looking for a place like this for a very long time"}
{"text":"ATL has the best wings in Phoenix I used to drive over 20 minutes to have their wings. But now a restaurant has opened less than 5 minutes away from my area. The selection of flavors is awesome the fries even have different styles. The wings are crispy and juice have plenty of meat. The food is so good that it is usually busy but it doesn't take to long to get your order.   The ATL style fries are the best they are crispy and have so much flavor. If you ask for half ATL and spicy ATL style the two combined work great together (keep in mind its an extra $0.50).  The drink selection is kinda small but they have kool-aid on tap so it wasn't to much of a problem. The menu is well designed so that you can see how much prices are and what you are getting.  I am definitely going to eat here as long as its around. In the end i can recommend this place all the time if anyone wants wings this is the place to go for sure. I have yet to have a problem. Can't wait to go again soon..."}
{"text":"Great customer service, Awesome food cooked to order. Best wings I have ever had! I suggest eating your wings there so they remain crispy!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've found in the city, and the staff is very accommodating. They'll let you sample any sauce/rub you want before ordering, so you know exactly what you're getting. The wings are crispy and flavorful, as are the fries. They have three types of Kool-Aid on \"tap,\" which really took me back to summers around the pool as a kid. Love it, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best wings ever the lunch special is amazing. Wings, fries, dessert & a drink for$11!"}
{"text":"Usually get the wings to go. Usually thewings are good, but twice already we get home and they are undercooked. First time we decided to give it a second chance but the second time the wings were actually raw. I understand they get busy and whatnot but I'm sure people won't mind waiting the extra 5 minutes for cooked chicken. Not going back."}
{"text":"***THIS IS AN UPDATE OF MY PREVIOUS REVIEWS FOR ATL WINGS***  I think I've pretty much tried 90% of the menu.  My favorites are still the Seasoned and Honey Habanero wings.  Like I said VooDooDaddy's wings held a special place in my heart, and ATL's Seasoned wings are the second coming.    I've tried both the fried catfish and the fried tilapia.  The tilapia is smaller, but I prefer them because of the flavor.    I've tried the Fisherman's Platter and it is tasty.  Fried flounder, shrimp, scallops, and fries + cole slaw.     The main reason I decided to update my review is because I have noticed that there are some people that are so hung up on how long the food takes to make sometimes.  The food is made-to-order.  Sometimes they get people who order a few dozen wings, sometimes, they get people who order party platters that consist of 100 wings.  ATL's wings are so good that they are RAPIDLY outgrowing their facility.  They are in need of a larger restaurant with a much larger kitchen with double or even triple the amount to fryers they currently have.      My advice:  CALL IN YOUR ORDER BEFORE HEADING OUT TO ATL WINGS!  Even if you plan to eat there,CALL IN YOUR ORDER!  It WILL take a while to get your food, but when you get your food, it will be delicious!  It's well worth the wait, but that doesn't mean you can't do the waiting in the comfort of your own home :)"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. This is now my new \"go to\" wing spot! 1st time I went there the lady at the front register offered testers of the wings and different sauces!! She even had the cooks mix different flavors to accommodate the taste I preferred! I also love the drinks they provide if you dine in. Thank you guys so much and please keep the great customer service and wings (: try the lemon pepper"}
{"text":"First time there, asked about a certain chefs special sauce and was immediately offered a sample of the sauce as well as an actual sample of the wing!  Who does that????  Very impressed and ordered what I sampled and it was amazing.  I asked for a little spicier and they nailed it.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great place to get wings I'm in love with the atl style they have. A must try. We go there all the time and for the most part the employees are super nice. And very helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing wings awesome service.. You would be smart to visit. The boneless wings are literally looking  like popcorn chicken so they're small so make sure you get up 12 piece or a 10-piece in order to really feel your stomach up"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. It's a great, local spot with great wings, tons of flavors and it serves Koop Aid! I don't usually care for wings but I can go for theirs just about any day!  I haven't had a flavor that I don't like, and they always give good recommendations, and they're honest about which flavors they don't care for."}
{"text":"Best wings so far in Arizona!!! Love the chef's specials wing sauce and extreme habenero. Wings are fried just right with a nice crisp."}
{"text":"This was my first time to ATL wings and I have to say that the Lucky's sweet red was recommended to me and it was delicious! It was a sauce that was a little hot and a little sweet and a lot delicious. The blue cheese dressing was the best that I've ever had with wings, bar none. I would recommend coming to this place for wings in Mesa"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by if you're looking just for wings. They have 65 cent/wing Tuesdays, and even have a discount on what looks like broken wings (need to ask). Expect to get pretty messy eating the wings -- they are drenched in oil just like Wing Stop's. Not of fan of the ATL dry rub, but the bbq wasn't overwhelming like most places. The restaurant itself is pretty small looking to seat only up to 4 or 5 families at a time. The gentleman who worked the front counter named Miguel is a pretty cool guy."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in a while. Crispy skin, juicy and great seasoning. Always go 50/50 with ATL and spicy ATL (different, but great heat). Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Very impressed after my first visit. Came here with a friend on his recommendation, we both got six wings, fries and a drink. I had honey barbecue and it was much better than any hb wings I'd ever had. It had a bit of spice and wasn't overly sweet like most hb sauces are. Fries went great with the leftover sauce, can't wait to go back and try another of the countless sauces and rubs! It's a bit far from my apartment but I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The place was awesome. Good vibe and great staff! Stopped in while on business travel while ordering wings I asked what the ATL Style was and I was given a sample to try! The sample locked me in on that flavor. The food was good. I think if you find the right flavor there is no way you can be disappointed. The wings were called to perfection!"}
{"text":"Food was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Would have given 5 stars if the kitchen staff didn't have potty mouths the whole time I was waiting for my order. I had a pretty large order and it was up really fast. Just glad I didn't have young children with me because the cursing was off the charts! I'll definitely go back IF they answer the phone for call ins!"}
{"text":"Called to place an order over the phone. Went in 25 minutes after I placed my order. Went to pick it up and had me wait another 20 minutes. Get home to find out they didn't even add the sauce to my wings at all. I guess the hype on here was to much. Made the disappointment even worse. If you guys call make sure they're making your order."}
{"text":"Best wings...try the chefs special for dry rub with sauce on top. The location was convenient and the staff was amazing!!"}
{"text":"These wings are Bomb !! Service is good this is one of my fave wing spots in Phoenix ! Cheap menu too .."}
{"text":"I love wings & this place sure does it up right! Called in 20 mins before they closed for a 60 wing to-go order. Picked up order 5 mins before closing and everything was done perfectly. The woman was friendly when she answered and was happy to take my order.  Wings: Go with the ATL style (dry rub.) Savory, delectable and excellent seasoning.  Sides: Mac & Cheese bites - crispy on the outside and rich cheesy yumminess! Fried Okra is awesome too (If you get this, eat it there it doesn't travel very well.)   Dessert: Honey Biscuits - just give them a try, they may not sound like much but they are really good.  FYI: On orders large orders you will have to pay with a CC over the phone so be aware they will require that. I would also go with the take-out order method as they are always crazy busy."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, They don't answer their phone ...this is common even at their chandler location"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is so good! Went in today and the staff was very friendly! They could tell we were new customers so they let us try the sauce we wanted. The cook even came up and gave us a sample wing while we waited. The wings are a good size and they put just enough sauce. Don't forget to try the honey biscuits they are to die for! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I usually go here at least once every couple of weeks for wings. I personally always get the ATL style traditional wings combo with ATL style fries. The seasoning on these have really great flavor. Always love the food and the staff is really friendly. We do come in with a good sized group and have had some ordering issues in the past, but the staff is really good at correcting their mistakes and usually give us some fries for the table or even some of their biscuits (which are really good doughnut type desert with honey and powdered sugar). They also have $0.65 wings on tuesdays which is a good deal. Love the place and would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of co-workers for lunch one day. Place was packed and we were lucky to find an empty table. I got half honey habanero and half citrus chipotle. Interesting flavors but both were a little on the sweet side. No matter - there are plenty more flavors to choose from. I figured we'd be back another time to try more flavors but one of our co-workers got shafted by this place big time. First off, they never called his order. When he finally flagged a server about it, she went to fix the problem but then he was given the wrong order - somebody else's order maybe but not what HE ordered. When they finally brought the correct order, the server served up such an attitude I had to wonder what he did/said to her when he ordered to deserve any of it. Who knows? He might have secretly goosed her when she was walking by or tried to harass her for her number while ordering at the counter. I'm just speculating and trying to figure out an explanation because it almost seems like he was singled out for such treatment and the server acted like she despised him in a way that was personal. The other woman at the counter who seemed to be running things was actually very pleasant about everything so who knows - maybe that particular server was just having a bad day. Whatever the case it ruined our chances for coming back because from now on if someone mentions ATL Wings as a lunch possibility for our group lunch gathering, there will definitely be a veto."}
{"text":"Man. This review is long overdue. Long, long overdue. What is a restaurant with wings? Should such a place exist which specializes in something that is usually cast aside as an appetizer, rather than being the main course? Oh wings, thou art humble, and we have dishonored you at many eating establishments. We have treated you with disrespect. We have ALL sinned. We call places such as \"Buffalo Wild Wings\" or \"Wing Stop\" proper places to seek you.   Its not too late though. There IS hope. You can be redeemed. ATL Wings exists, and you can achieve chicken wing nirvana here. :)   When it comes to wings, this is THE place. A chicken wing heaven on earth with well over 200 flavors. Their signature \"ATL Style\" is a must try upon your first visit. I've attached a few pictures to give proof to the miracles I witnessed being made from scratch in this place. Their lemon pepper is exquisite. Traditional buffalo, from mild to toxic, are absolute delicacies. Rick Ross should have invested here. Lol  Still, I'm glad he did not. I feel lucky to have this locally owned spot in my neighborhood that effortlessly sons all the competition. That's right. I said it you other wing places out there! ATL Wings is your father! You are only allowed to make wings with his approval and only for so long. ATL Wings is coming for you, and your lunch money is being revoked."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the wings being so good this place would go out of business. Horrible and I mean horrible customer service the honey boo boo chick at the cash register always has a nasty attitude like she's mad I'm giving you money to stay in business and the owners and management just forget it they are useless. On top of that they give you 1 ranch for 12 wings lol talk about cheap skates. Half the time the phone won't go thru so you actually have to deal with their terrible service. Recommend just the wings but everything else about this company is terrible."}
{"text":"Good wings - great service. The girl at the counter gave us samples pf the sauces. It was great. The wings are not greasy at all. We will be back for more!! I just wish that they have carrot :) I think the wings are better than the one from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I haven't eaten at this restaurant to experience terrible customer service; my experience came via telephone when trying to place an office order; pay in restaurant when pick up, but, the woman that answered the phone was not only rude, but refused to placed the order for some stupid reason we never heard of; the rep was giving so much push back regarding the preparation and readiness of our orders; there were 7 individual orders all paying with cash with the request of pay in restaurant when pick up {our lunch is 30 minutes in length and the driver was willing to be late if accommodated!}  We've heard awesome things about the place in relation to the wings, however, failed to mention that the staff displays piss poor customer service and has absolutely no respect in communication with paying customers; needless to say, I'll never spend my money {or anyone else's for that matter} nor will I ever refer this restaurant to my friends, co-workers or strangers looking for something to eat to this establishment; shame on you all!  I'll stay with Wingstop!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite wing place. They put all the others to shame. If you want wonderfully crispy juicy tasty wings you need to come here. I had the Spicy ATL rub. When I ordered the cashier said it's 8.5/10 heat level and it was. But I love spicy hot so I went ahead and ordered. My daughter ordered medium buffalo flavor and was equally happy with her selection. We each upgraded to the meal that included a side and fountain drink. The fries were thin cut, nothing special and was the side salad I had. Their ranch dressing was so delicious my daughter wanted to drink it. She's a ranch lover. Service was fine. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Only place to get wings! The wings are amazing and the price isn't bad. Absolutely my family's favorite place for wings! And we drive 30 minutes just to get these wings! I recommend them to anyone! Don't be the person who has never had this place because you are missing out!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for wings. ATL Dry rub is the best!!! Try it with some ATL style fries and some Kool Aid! Plan on getting here at least 30 minutes after opening or 30 minutes before closing for the best experience, sometimes they open a little bit late or close a little bit early  --- but it's okay the wings are worth it!"}
{"text":"2nd time at this location. Dissapointed. Spent S $60 on 32 wings and 4 drinks and I'll give them a thumbs up on flavor but the actual chicken wings are cooked horribly wrong. Over cooked, dry and saturated with oil. I'll never go back. Long Wongs and Wing stop are superior to ATL Wings. Bottom line I'm super dissapointed and was a waste if my $. The 2 stars is for the Koolaide."}
{"text":"Well I finally found me a Wing Spot that blows all the others out of the water!  This is truly it...Went there tonight, ordered a 10 piece mix with the ATL dry rub  on 3, Honey Hot on 3, and Buffalo Hot on the rest.  I just asked for a water cup on the drink.  The girl brought out my wings, they gave me 12 instead of 10 which I thought was really cool, also plenty of Ranch.  Another girl also brought me a complimentary drink cup, another plus in my book.  I took half the order home because these are nice plump wings!  I also bowed down to the cooks before I left and said Thanks guys, the wings were phenomenal.  They were indeed, and I'm a true connoisseur!  I've eaten wings all over the country and these rank towards the very top!  Can't wait to go back!  The outstanding customer service was very refreshing! I so appreciate that when eating out."}
{"text":"Love that they let you taste a wing with different sauces... Really good spot.. I like the mustard Honey havenero and the ATL dry Alison the cajon. We will be back"}
{"text":"Poor service..Rude Staff.. I rounded my bill with 2$ tip to 11$ and the lady charged me 20$ on my card, 110% tip !! Could be my mistake but she should have alerted me !!   Food tasted good (reason for the lone *) but expensive for the quantity.."}
{"text":"I tried the garlic parmesan wings, honey haberno, and seasoned wings with ranch dressing. The menu was clear and it was a standard wing place. There were plenty of flavor to choose from. The wings were meaty with plenty of sauce. It reminded me of a better version of wing stop since it was cheaper, I believe 15 pieces of wings were around $11 and there was actual meat on it. I wish the sauces were all stronger. I was not impressed by the seasoned wings. The honey haberno had a kick to it for the first wing but then the haberno kind of died out. The garlic parmesan was okay, just the standard garlic parmesan. I wouldn't mind going to this place again if I was craving wings, I would try the other flavors though."}
{"text":"These wings are great! I am a hot wing lover and their wings really do stand out among the other places I have tried in Scottsdale. They do make you pay over the phone when ordering to pick up (totally fair!) so do be prepared for that!"}
{"text":"So, ATL wings is not close to our house, but its very close to the school my wife teaches at. We are both wing fans (the food of course, not the stinkin' hockey team. Go Hawks!), but hadn't ventured to many places in the Valley. I was Yelping for a dinner option when she mentioned it again. Wings sounded damn good, so off we went.    Let me start with the food. We ordered 18 wings with Honey BBQ, ATL Style, and Classic Hot. I liked them all, but the ATL Style was the real winner. I've never been a big fan of dry wings, but I usually test a place out by trying their featured dish/flavor. They were so good, I doubt I'll get around to ever trying another flavor. Salt & Spices, Vinegar and some kind of awesomeness.    The wings are not breaded, plenty large, and cooked nice and crispy. We did a combo, so we got a large fountain drink and fries. The fries were solid, hot dog stand quality fries. Next time I'll get the ATL flavored fries too. I should also mention, they had 3 flavors of Kool-Aid available as well.   Place is clean. It was busy (Wednesday night). It took a while to get our food, but you could tell these are freshly made and not pre-made then tossed in sauce.   I've seen some complaints about adding gratuity. The sign said for tables of 5 or more. I don't totally get that, but who cares. It's a take out place with a few tables. The red lighting and excessive carnival signs are a bit odd, but not enough to drop a star."}
{"text":"This food is so damn good I can't get enough of it. We need more places though, like in Avondale. :)"}
{"text":"Food wise it was incredible, wings (hot) tasted great, ATL fries was better than the usual fast food joints. But the kool aid was a little too sugary and the set up of the establishment was confusing. I had to go get my drink on one side then my lid and straw on the other side, it really felt like a maze. Overall food was great but not a fan of the fun house look."}
{"text":"Food was good but the customer service was one of the WORST I've ever experienced. Called in advance around 5pm to place a large order for myself and some coworkers. Walked in at about 5:35pm since I had to work at 6pm. They were kinda busy but I thought it was ok since I figured I would pay and get my food and be on my way. Paid and they said it would be a few minutes. I stood to the side thinking they were finishing up the order since they were a bit busy. 15 mins passed and no one updated me on what was going on so I had to go up to the girl at the register to ask what was going on and she said it would be a few more mins. Let me remind you it was a bit frustrating since I worked at 6pm and it was now 5:50pm. So I patiently waited and sat down and they called my name at 6:13. I asked the girl that was giving me my food \"was it not cooked until I got here?\" And she replied with \"we don't make food until it's paid for\" with a nasty attitude. so that just aggravated me even more at the fact that they didn't tell me this over the phone. I could've easily paid for it and picked it up without being late to work and waiting the 30+ mins in the restaurant. So I asked her why I wasn't told this on the phone and she just stayed quiet and when one of her coworkers said something regarding how long I was there for to her, she just replied with \"oh well, It is what it is\" finished giving me my order and walked to the back. Not trying to make myself more angry, I just walked out and left. Not once did they apologize for the long wait or for not telling me that it wouldn't be made till I paid. I work in customer service and this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I ever had."}
{"text":"By far the best wings I've ever had. The employees are equally as amazing. The dry rub ATL wings are my go to, but all the other flavors have been pretty good as well. They crispy on the outside and juicy inside."}
{"text":"Super yummy. Lots of different flavors to choose from and fresh cut fries with bomb seasoning."}
{"text":"Heard about them for months, finally got in there to try them. Dear Past Jeff, screw you for waiting so long! This place is fantastic.  We went in a little unsure where to start with all the flavors of wings up there, but they took great care of us, shot us some samples, and got us connected with several flavors to try. We grabbed a basket of fries to go along with it as I thought we may need something to cool our tongues - it was the right call. My nose was running like a faucet from the heat, which is - in this case  - a good sign.  Great staff and some of the best wings I've had in the valley. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Place is super clean and the staff was friendly. The ATL wings are good but the lemon pepper was delicious also. You can't leave this place without trying the biscuit with honey and sugar! So delicious! Best wings and everyone was super nice. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"These wings are deelish! They are so meaty and well seasoned. I had honey BBQ got 20 wings for 13 bucks, and the honey biscuits made me melt.  These are made upon order and do take some time, so if you are in a rush call ahead otherwise, plan on waiting at least 25 minutes for your order.  I signed up for their text messages and now am alerted on ther specials: 50 cent wing Tuesdays 4-9."}
{"text":"Good god these are the best wings I've ever had.  These guys have the best combo of crispness and sauciness on a wing.   These wings are good size, not sure why people are saying they are small.  If you want skimpy wings, go to Oreganos.   I'm scared I discovered the this place because I'll be craving them all the time.  Highly recommend the Chefs Special sauce."}
{"text":"If you order a \"dry rub\" expect it to be tossed in a sauce. Do they not understand the concept of a dry rub?  Additionally, I prepaid and waited just as long as the walk ins. My first and last time ordering from there."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings I have had in my life. Im a huge wing advocate and have tried numerous places. I read the reviews which was enough to spark interest. This place had it all, great drinks, great atmosphere, phenomenal customer service, and of course, the best wings."}
{"text":"We knew this place was going to be pretty good when we arrived around 7:30pm and the line was basically out the door.   The setup is kinda weird but it's definitely better then how the previous business was setup. The line moved pretty quickly and they have seats for those that are here to take out.   We ordered 18 wings and decided to spilt up the flavors. We got 6 garlic prepper, 6 medium, and 6 lemon pepper. The cashier was friendly and our total came out to be close to $25 including a drink. A drink is $2.59 and each wing will cost you close to $1.  Finding a table was a challenge. There are two sections where you can sit at. Most of the tables were a bit dirty and the trash cans were pretty full. No I wouldn't have minded if the trash cans maybe had a lid on them? Some tables are right by the trash cans and the trash is out in the open. Yuck   The cashier brought our food out about 15 minutes after ordering, and the wings were sooo HOT. They were crispy, juicy, and were a pretty good size. Our favorite was definitely the garlic pepper! They were so good!   Come here for great wings!! They have a ton of flavors and by the taste of it they must all taste great!   3 stars just because cleanliness is not there. Other then the trash being so full and the tables being so sticky, there was random trash on the floor and it was so muggy inside.   Next time I will definitely order to go."}
{"text":"ATL is hands down, the BEST wings place in all of Arizona!!!! The people are nice and friendly and you can tell they are proud of their wings and sauces! Every time I go here, I leave with a smile! Thank you for making the best wings ever! It's like a special treat everyone should get the chance to enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is great! As soon as we walked in we were nicely greeted! Cashier was very friendly and recommended what she liked!   The wings... The wings are delicious! We ordered boneless and they were amazing! They have a great variety of flavors, the honey mustard is super yummy!  Their fries are good as well!  My favorite part has to be the kool aid on tap!   This became our new favorite wing place for sure!"}
{"text":"Best wings around hands down. Super crispy and juicy just like a wing should be. I will no longer be going to wing stop this place is the sh*t"}
{"text":"2nd time here, not so cool. Straight up missed order the three people who ordered after me, got their order before me, wait make that 4, I'm sitting here waiting as I type this...I had to ask for my order. I don't know how there can be such a difference in service one visit to the next. Yeah, they are busy, but I work in customer service myself, this should t be like this. Wait, now the 5th person behind me....I swear asking about my order is making it take longer...my review went from a 5 star, to a 4 star, then a 3 star, now a 2 star....common.   OMG!!! I don't care what anyone says about this place, if they say it's not good, they're either ignorant, or just don't know truly fantastic wings. They are on top of it here. It was our first time, they gave us a couple sample wings, yes, sample wings. Very very friendly, and on point!! These are the best wings I've ever had, and my wife agrees!!! It's about 5 miles from home, and there are other wing places closer, but I will come here anytime we feel like wings. Thanks ATL, FANTASTIC WINGS!!!"}
{"text":"Probably on my top favorite wings list. We were in Arizona for the weekend and we stopped by ATL wings twice. The variety of sauces and the quick service... amazing. I've never seen fruit punch served as a soft drink, even better! Crunchy and saucy!"}
{"text":"I'm SO happy I found ATL wings.  This is my go to spot for GREAT wings.  You can get wings almost anywhere (Buffalo Wild Wings, Native New Yorker, etc.) but if you want AWESOME GREAT wings, ATL is the place.   I've been going to ATL now for a little over a year and I swear the food and the service is consistently GREAT every time.  I typically go for 10 wings, which I split half Honey BBQ and Half ATL Style (Seasoned).  I've tried several other flavors and they are ALL delicious but these Honey BBQ and ATL Style are my favorites.  On Tuesday's they have a 60 cent wing special, so sometimes I bump my order up to 12 wings on those days. there are also other tasty items on the menu.  The honey biscuits are must try!    This place doesn't only offer up GREAT food but their service is out of this world.   I can't say enough about the great service.  It's true that it may take a while for your order to be ready but like the sign says in front of the store, \"You can't rush food that taste this good!\"  If you don't want to wait around for your order, just give them a call and order about 10-15 minutes ahead. They will be ready with your order and a smile when you arrive.  I Get a smile and a welcome (by name) every single time I step into the restaurant.  They really make you feel special and at home.  It's like the neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name.  I usually do take out but I'd recommend eating in for your first time, because I guarantee you will want to order more after you have your first round."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, picked this place because of the number of stars. I was not disappointed. The wings are amazing and do not pass on the biscuits."}
{"text":"Best wings ever!!! Last week they messed up our order I went back the next day and Tete made sure my order was perfect! I called today to place my order and she knew exactly who i was. Not only are the wings amazingly delicious but they have amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Best wings around! Gotta try their atl dry rub and the garlic parmesan.  Oh yeah and make sure to try the biscuits. They are like Indian fry bread with powdered sugar and honey. Soo good!!"}
{"text":"ATL Wings are the biggest wings I've had in AZ.  They are even bigger than what the wings used to be at Oreganos before they completely sold out.  I tried 3 flavors: Hot, Medium, and ATL Spicy.  All of them were really good.  I would come back to try all of the flavors.    The wings were HUGE and cooked to order.  The sauces were excellent.  We shared a couple baskets of fries that were also pretty good.    The service here was excellent.  I really didn't think it would be a 5 star review but the service took it there.  We were given a sample wing when we came in and then we were given a beignet on the way out.    ATL Wings is doing it right.  I hope I get one closer to me so I can come back more often.  Stay up!"}
{"text":"The wings are big and tasty. It's on the pricey side for a wing shack but the quality is there, even if the store front isn't."}
{"text":"Best wings that I've had in Phoenix. Very meaty and extremely flavorful. The ATL wings are my favoite spice at the moment but they are all equally delicious."}
{"text":"2nd time at ATL WINGS and it did not disappoint!!!! Lemon Pepper is my favorite! Service was great! I've read reviews about customer service and had a great experience. Seriously the best wings in town- probably Arizona!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying \"BEST WINGS\" in town!!!! This is a cute spot in downtown Scottsdale- the atmosphere is great- restaurant is clean and vibrant... the owner walked us through all the flavor she they offer. Wings cooked fresh and perfected with their tons of flavors to choose from! We got the Chefs Choice (which is a mild with a kick), Lemmon pepper, garlic parmesan and honey BBQ. Can't wait to come back and try more flavors"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say I'm not normally a wings person. But, I saw the Yelp reviews and gave it a try. These were, by far, the best wings I've ever had. The extreme honey habanero were amazing and the garlic parmesan were even better. I mean these wings were nothing short of amazing. And the service was just as amazing... Super nice and they brought out their awesome honey biscuits for us to try. I hope they move to So Cal!"}
{"text":"Quality white meat boneless wings. Plump and juicy, too. Sauce was a perfect level of tang and spicy (I got medium). The bad: smelly inside and not very clean. This was my first visit, about 1PM on a weekday. All the tables were dirty. Some still had trash on them, but all of them had grease and crumbs. Smelly like a clogged restroom or back flow from the sewage/drains. Service was a teeny bit slow and had a lot of errors, I figured the guy at the register taking orders was new/ training. He was very nice, but spoke very quietly and with a mumble. No big deal, but I was over charged and so was my friend. Again, no big deal, but maybe repeat people's order back to them before they pay?  The kitchen you could see from the counter was very messy, which can be unappealing seeing tons of empty Franks red hot sauce piled up. Service was a bit inaccurate but friendly. Wish the inside smelled better but tasty wings, crisp fries and house made ranch."}
{"text":"First time trying ATL wings today, so amazing!  Awesome customer service, and the Atlanta style dry rub wings were so delicious.  We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"THE BEST WINGS EVER!! If I need to come all the way from Anaheim, California for the wings I definitely will.  In top of the wings the customer service was amazing they definitely make you feel like home.  This is the spot for wing!!! We also got free wings and honey biscuits!!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the East Valley!! Delicious flavors, friendly staff, clean environment.......and you can't forget the biscuits with honey, they will melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Can we just say Wow!!!! Awesome place to get your wing on. Here is the bad No coke products  But they make it up with having kook aid and it is delish.   The wings are flavorful my favorite the chef special, the spicy atl   We also tired the teriyaki boneless they weren't bad just not super great. I liked the chipotle honey better, had better flavor. The medium is not hot at all but is really good.   The fries come in a huge portion   Really liked this place we will be back"}
{"text":"I'm not  5 star giver but for this place I was very pleased and impressed. I walked in and stated I was there to find out what all the commotion was and I see now. Just moved here from Atlanta so I saw the theme but was told ATL Wings stands for \"All The Love\" not Atlanta....whatever, either way I'll be back. Wings were the right size not small as I call \"2 bite wings\" where in 2 bites you're done. I had the sweet n tangy my friend had the lemon pepper and they were the best. Next time going to try the citrus chipotle."}
{"text":"Placed an order a day before and got our order out an hour late.. other customers waiting for over an hr and a half. Wings are good but worst customer service. Management needs to change."}
{"text":"Great wings, poor taste as far as front end goes. I've been here quite a few times over the last 2 years. When the owner has been there service was good & fun. I went a few days ago and the cashier was ok but there was another girl working up front taking phone orders. This girl had 2 kids running all over the place and screaming. She did nothing to settle them down. Not a very good representation of the place. I probably won't be back for a looooong time. It's too bad because the owner was very nice & funny the few times I've seen her."}
{"text":"The wings are phenominal! The mild wings taste very savory and the Spicy ALT wings are to die for. The service was wonderful, they were very welcoming and kind. It seems like a chill place to eat out with you friends or family."}
{"text":"Just tried these today. Wings are meaty, crisp skin perfectly cooked and they have a large selection of sauces and dry rubs to choose from. I loved all 3 that I tried today and look forward to trying them all.  Easy better than buffalo wild wings. Also the folks that literate this place are extremely nice. They are worth the visit alone."}
{"text":"Best wings of anywhere.  They have kool aid. Tuesday they have $.75 wings. Protip: extra crispy."}
{"text":"I would've given more stars but their customer service is terrible, specifically Lynn. When my husband and I arrived it was 20 minutes to close so we expected to order and leave. Maybe it was because we both had went to the gym so our appearance wasn't all dressed up. Or maybe she truly just has an attitude problem but as soon as my husband and I arrived, she left to the back.   We would've ordered, got our food, and left however, we stood there long enough to hear 2 people yell \"We have customers!\" The first time it was yelled, we could hear people laughing. Then someone came and said they would be right with us. Then a second time it was yelled. Out walks Lynn. A very unhappy and borderline rude Lynn  who felt the need to make it clear our order was to go.   I ordered the traditional honey mustard wings and they were meaty and delicious. The ATL style fries were also very tasty. Would've given 5 if not for the rude service."}
{"text":"The wings here are impeccable.   Get the ATL style wings and fries.  You won't be disappointed.  The service was great, including the cashier letting my mom borrow her sweater.  If you're a child of the 80's you'll be thrilled by the 3 different full sugar flavors of legit Kool-Aid.   ATL Wings should go nationwide, spreading chicken wing goodness wherever they go."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for wings.  That is all they do here and they do them well. Its a walk up and order or call in kind of place.  The people who work here are very nice and helpful and will let you try the different sauces, tell them is your first time and they give you a couple of wings to try. Their  signature rub is the ATL and is very good.  Now these are not cheap wings you pay a little more but the size of the wings are worth it."}
{"text":"Moved into the neighborhood and finally tried this place out, can I say Awesome! Wings are so good, not those tiny ones you get some places. So many flavors to choose from, nice and crispy not at all oily! I had the Lemon Pepper and Hot Wings, perfection! The service is quick, the price is right, just wish they could deliver! I will be making this my fave wing spot!"}
{"text":"This is a shitty place . They are very rude and when it comes to food they give you wrong items from what you ordered."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Called in my order then they don't make the food till you get there. Wait for my food to be fried and sauced. Leave. Get a call 5 mins later to tell me they only gave me 6 of the 18 wings I ordered. I go back to get my order they don't seem apologetic and just hand me the bag like \"my bad.\" I then decided that this was not worth my money or time and asked for a refund. They didn't try to keep my business or do anything that would mitigate the entire experience. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wings were not bad,I had honey habenero(not hot at all,pass if you want heat) had Cajun hot (def packs some heat) the bad part about it they charge 50 cents to split flavors,wth????.try the fried okra and spicy tator tots awesome.The celery sticks??? went directly to the trash(not worth eating).The wait wasnt long on a thursday prob 15 minutes in and out of the door.Wont be going out of my way for this place"}
{"text":"Great wings and good ranch.  The Blue Cheese dressing is not worth mentioning.  The seasoned, and garlic Parmesan make you want to inhale the wing.  I am not a fan of the sweet things so the tea and the Kool-Aid are not at all desirable to me.    Their french fries are very good.  Fresh cut and fried to order.  They sprinkle a little salt and serve them.  Simple yet very tasty with their sauces.  Since Ny Boyz closed down they have the best garlic Parmesan in town and the seasoned have a very unique flavor that is different from any other place in the Metro area.    Service was very good.  The young lady at the counter was very polite and more importantly remembered my name the whole time I was there (impressive).    This place would be a five if they had a few more drink options.  Canned soda, and over sweetened tea and Kool-Aid options are not my cup of tea (no pun intended).  Hopefully they open a location downtown or closer to The Veen."}
{"text":"Music is great. Environment was very friendly. Glad to be back in my home town finding new places! Menu was clear and easy to understand. Food was even better. I had 10 wings and a large basket of  their Cajun fries for around $15. I know where I'm coming for wings next time I'm back in the 602."}
{"text":"Wings are good, but the customer service is TERRIBLE. Called and placed an order ($50) while at work and they stated that it'll be 10 mins. Decided to wait 15-20 mins because it was a big order, coworker gets there to pick up the order and the food wasn't done and she had to wait an additional 20 mins. When she gets back to the office she stated that the cashier was just rude. I had enough with her attitude because she had an attitude single the beginning. I called to talk to a manager, and guess what?? She's one of the owners. I had no problem telling her my issue with her but she kept cutting me off when i would y'all and kept saying, so what's the problem? All while smacking her teeth. I finally told her that she had a shitty attitude. I called another location to complain about her and was told that she is an owner but that her older sister is the general manager and would take care of this and that she would call me to talk. Never heard from them. I've made sure to tell everyone about my experience at that location. Chandler location has lost 60 clients because of her attitude."}
{"text":"Dined-in a big change from months ago.  Service is not as friendly as it use to be. The food was mediocre, nothing to write home about. It would be nice if great service came with the food."}
{"text":"I went here the other Wednesday night and then again on Thursday.  I really like the folks that worked there, they were friendly and went out of their way to make you feel welcome. They immediately recognized me and seemed genuinely excited I was back.  Now for the wings; their signature dry rub is the only dry rub I have ever enjoyed, it was on point and absolutely delicious.  The sweet red is perfect sweet and hot sauce, I like the fact that the sweet doesn't over power the hot like most \"Honey Hots\" do. The Hot Sauce is solid and the wings themselves are nice and plump not scrawny and sad like many places.   I think I may have found a new place for when I am in the mood for wings only."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and its always a great experience.  The wings are amazing.  The Kool-aid is really good. The staff is always friendly.  I've never had a complaint or concern until my most recent visit.  I watched as the orders were being prepared and I noticed the guy that was preparing the wings was chewing gum. That freaked me out. The way he was chewing I am sure that spittle fell onto the wings. He was also sweating quite a bit. I was grossed out!  When my order was ready I took it and left. I wanted those wings so bad that I tried to rationalize eating them, but in the end, I just couldnt.  I threw my order out. I just could not eat wings that no doubt had spittle on them. ATL is a great place and this was the first time that I've ever seen anyone in the back chewing gum.  I will go back and I will be sure to observe the food preparers BEFORE placing my order. If I see this again I will not order and I will not go back. That is just too gross for me to handle."}
{"text":"Um how did I drive past this place forever and never go in?  Pretty much the best wings I've ever had. I'm picky when it comes to food, especially when I know how easy it is to prepare it correctly with real ingredients. ATL Wings did not disappoint! We tried the Parmesan garlic, mild and ATL style wings. Do yourself a favor and take the cashiers recommendation - get all your wings ATL style! The flavor is amazing, perfect balance between herbs, spices and a tiny bit hot. The mild flavor is vinegary, just like how homemade sauce should be and Parmesan garlic is very good as well!  We came early Friday afternoon, place was clean and got our food in about ten minutes. Everyone was very friendly. Soda, tea and kool aid are your choice of drink.   This place is awesome and on my list now!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Wings are great.  Went 2x in 1 day while on business travel.  Staff was super friendly... and that was at 2 different locations.  Miss this place back east."}
{"text":"I love love love the 'Spicy ATL' dry rub!!!  For those who prefer the HOT side of wings, the Spicy ATL has a nice mild heat, but is full of flavor.  My family and I stop in every couple of weeks because we can't resist the craving for 'All The Love'...not only for the wings, but the crew as well. ATL has become a family favorite? for sure."}
{"text":"The wings were phenomenal. Ordered 24-piece bone-in wings with the ATL dry rub, medium, honey BBQ, and honey mustard. The honey mustard and honey BBQ tasted exactly the same, but again, they were still great. The ranch and blue cheese that come on the side were also very good and tasted homemade. Along with our order we had two side salads and at $3.75 a pop, I expect a little more than lettuce and shredded carrots. Plus, you don't even get celery and carrots with your wings which is.... different. I also thought 25 minutes for 24 wings and two salads was way too long. Especially when we were the only ones there, and when the people who came in after us received their order was kind of irritating."}
{"text":"My new favorite wing place! So many flavors to choose from. Three different flavors of kool aid, honey biscuits, French fries, and even a small flavor sample on our first visit. Unfortunate it's located in a run down shopping center and the outdoor seating is less desirable since its in full western exposure, but there's seating inside and a few flat panel tv screens. We were told this place was here for 3-4 years now. You can get traditional or boneless wings in a variety of quantities. The wings are quite generous and decent sizes. Forget hooters or BW2, this is a place worth trying. We had no issues with service or waiting. In sure if you ordered a lot and with a variety of flavors, it may take longer than one order of the same flavor. Highly recommend the lemon pepper, garlic parmesan, ATL, and chefs special."}
{"text":"Solid wings. Got the Atl dry rub with the chef's special sauce on the side. Fries weren't too crisp; so, would skip on these next time."}
{"text":"This place has some decent wings and is one of the only options for wings in old town! I'm used to getting wings from Wing Stop, but this spot isn't much worse and you don't have to pay extra for ranch! They're about $1/wing, but $0.75/wing on Tuesdays. The hot and lemon pepper flavors are tasty and pretty safe choices that I like to stick with (plus they're very low on carbs). The wings are crispy and flavorful, but they don't include any carrots or celery.  If you're ordering take out over the phone, you will need to either give them your payment info over the phone or pay at the restaurant and wait a few minutes for them to sauce your wings. There's plenty of seating if you're dining in, but the workers aren't exactly the friendliest.  The place is always empty when I come in, but I hope they stay open because I don't want to have to drive across town for wings!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Trust the reviews, folks!   I am always on the hunt for great new wing places to try and I think this place just claimed the #1 spot!   First of all, the ATL dry rub? A must! I got the regular and my friend got the spicy and they were sooooooo flavorful. Be warned, the spicy is pretty dang spicy!   My other half ended up being the Cajun BBQ and I loved those as well. These wings are big, crispy, and flavored just right. Did not disappoint!   The perfect way to end was with the honey biscuits too. Lots of honey drizzled with cinnamon and powdered sugar mmmmmmmm so good.   I cant wait to come back.....it might just within the same week...."}
{"text":"Alright so I just wanted take a moment and tell everyone on yelp your absolutely f#=king nuts if you don't eat at ATL wings it is a little tiny spot it is a treasure chest the customer service is above and beyond what they should be there all willing to go out of their way to make sure that everything is at its best I highly recommend no matter where you live in the valley that you drive out to ATL and give it a shot no regrets I know it doesn't look much from where it sits at but inside it is a precious jewel of delicious wings. In the owners are the nicest people we've ever met and I highly recommend the ATL rub on their wings"}
{"text":"Atl has some very good wings. They are a nicely sized with enough meat and the right amount of sauce. I was full off a dinner of 9 wings and shared cheese fries. They don't have a lot of people working so you might have to wait while one person juggles taking orders, answering phones, and bringing plates to tables.  Aside from this, the workers are very nice.  My only other complaint is while the exterior of the wings had a perfect crisp, the center wasn't hot  enough (temperature) to my liking. Still, I'd def considering driving out here to get my wings fix."}
{"text":"Truly my favorite wing spot. Just the right crispiness and sauce. ATL flavored are the best. I wish they would deliver also"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect wings. The ATL sauce is legit...never had anything like it before. Oh and don't pass on the honey biscuits so so good.  Wings are my fav food and these are easily top one or two in town.  No question."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings BY FAR that I have ever had from a wing shop!!!! Get the ATL STYLE wings and you will be licking your fingers and grinning from ear to ear!!! The have cool-aid on tap as well!! THREE flavors of it!"}
{"text":"YUM! I think these are the best wings I've ever had! I had the medium hot traditional and the ATL dry rub traditional and I've been craving more every since. The owner and his father were there and were very friendly. I got the combo deal with six wings a salad and a drink for $10.33. Very reasonable. It took awhile to order but the meal was ready very soon after that. I'll be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Ordered 10 medium traditional wings to go and fries... Get back to work and they gave me 6 wings and soggy fries. Guess it's my fault for not checking the bag?"}
{"text":"The wings are very very good. Good size and a bit crispy.   However, be prepared to spend money. For a little hole in the wall they are fairly pricey (likely due to the quality of the wings)  I'm knocking off 1 star because I want to phone in orders every week and they NEVER answer their phone. I drive over and they aren't busy so I'm not sure what is going on. I usually have to sit and wait for my to go order for 15-20 minutes because they won't pick up they're phone."}
{"text":"Best wings ever!!variety of flavors and cooked to order My favorite is the ATL style but the have so many options it's hard to choose."}
{"text":"Good crispy wings with tastey fries! Solid place to indulge in some wings. #LOTSOFSALT"}
{"text":"If you are craving wings this is place to go. My goodness they are soooo delicious! Leave room for dessert, their sweet biscuits are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Just got done eating at ATL Wings and they met all expectations! Food was great, customer service was great, and they have Koolaid machines! Their sauces separate them from the other wing spots though! If you like hot they can definitely give you a good flavor hot sauce or if you just like good flavor they definitely have a wide variety there! I will definitely be coming back to this place! 5 stars from me ATL"}
{"text":"I DONT NEED TO RIGHT A BOOK ON HOW GOOD THIS PLACE IS!!  It's pretty simple ... Best damn wings in all of the land!! Put some in your face today damn it!!! Oh yeah, Kool-AID ON TAP!!! friendly folks that made great food!!!"}
{"text":"Asked for 24 boneless wings extra wet. I said I was on the way so it took me 10 mins to get there and I live 10 mins away. So I get home and the wings are cold, and they have normal sauce they were far from extra wet there was NO sauce on the foil whatsoever, even a normal wing should have sauce on the foil. Terrible wings, excellent service, lady on the phone was nice and in person was fast. Very fast overall but I would have rather waited instead of the cook cutting corners to save time. There was no pressure to do it that big of an order that fast"}
{"text":"Tried to order by phone, absolute horrific experience. Was put on hold twice, for five minutes without even having a chance to ask a question, and eventually was hung up on without speaking to anyone. Tried to call back three times, kept getting a message saying that mailbox was full. Never even got a chance to try the place. After THIS first impression, I probably won't ever even try again. Ridiculous. Was REALLY looking forward to it, too. I only gave it one star because Yelp made me at least give something."}
{"text":"I have been to the spot several times and not once have I has a bad wing or experience the workers are nice and friendly and everything gets out in a timely manner. If you going to get I drink I suggest the blue kool-aid hands down the best I ever had as far as the wing flavors I highly recommend the lucky sweet red lemon pepper and the Cajun hot they're are awesome I also recommend atl rub on the frys gives it the extra kick so if you needs wings skip the chain wing places and hit up ATL Wings you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Very good wings with excellent hospitality. They even gave us extra wings to try, ones that weren't even on the menu. If you love wings this place is must try."}
{"text":"For reals this is an awesome wing place. Bunch of good sauces and the ATL style rub is so good. I started going to the location in Chandler and it was always good too. Always the best place to get take-out wings, for sure!"}
{"text":"Great wings. Lots of choices for flavors. This is my first visit and I'll be back. Fast service and the place is clean and staff very friendly. My next favorite place for wings."}
{"text":"First, my only complaint ... If you call ahead, they don't do anything with your order until you get there and actually pay for it. Then they start making your wings. Odd...   These wings are great! They are great size and the sauce options are out of this world. My favorite is Habanero Honey Hot! I always try different stuff and have never been disappointed but w/ all the options you have ... I would try 6 of these and see if you don't order them every time. Oh and they have blue kool aid! ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here before a few years ago and there were no issues, great food. My boyfriend and I came here last week and he ordered boneless mild wings and I ordered bone in half mild half lemon pepper. I used to work at Wingstop, so I know my wings!! While we were ordering, I noticed a large bucket of already precooked chicken under the sauce table so full the lid was barely covering it. This is a big no no, the food is way too close to the floor and is not heated so it's not maintaining safe temp. I'm guessing they did this to save with cook time by just redropping the wings whenever ordered, but that dries out chicken and is also super dangerous for consumers! Before when we first came here years ago, there was a sign that went along the lines of \"perfection takes time, allow 15 mins for your food\" which is the normal cook time once you drop fresh raw chicken for it to fry and cook fully. Even with noticing this, I ate the food, and the wings were okay and the mild sauce was actually good, but my boyfriends boneless wings were literally the size of popcorn chicken and we paid about $8 for 6 pieces!! Ranches are small and the tables were dirty. I love the koolaid on tap, but this place has seriously gone downhill!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this place and I'm hooked! The food is some of the best wings I've had. The service is great. They were welcoming and friendly. My favorite part. Is the fact that they have Kool Aid! I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings! I am not a big wing person but my boyfriend is, so I decided to be nice and let us get some wings for dinner (haha) and I got the teriyaki wings and I was surprised at how good they were!! Amazing!! We got there dessert with honey and powder sugar and it was amazing as well! Cheap easy good food, makes native my taste crappy! The wait is definitely worth it"}
{"text":"I'm sure Sunday morning a lot of folks were up dressed in their best to go to church.   My husband and I, on the other hand, were waiting outside Atl Wings at 5 mins. to 11:00 like a couple of patients with their brand new medical marijuana card waiting for the dispensary to open.    As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the friendly young woman working at the front counter and when I said we'd never been there before she showed us the menu and choice of flavors.  It's a little overwhelming so we chose the seasoned and the parmesan garlic flavors.  Also based on the other reviews we got an order of honey biscuits to try.  While we waited I had to use the restroom and was impressed with how clean it was.  I don't mean just the floor was swept and the sink wiped off.  The WHOLE thing was clean.  How many times do you go into a restaurant bathroom and after you wash your hands you touch either the paper towel dispenser or the door handle and feel something that might be salad dressing?  It might be cheese?  It might be a cluster of infectious bacteria?  Whoever cleans these bathrooms wipes everything down.  That says a lot about the overall cleanliness of the joint.  This place was spotless.  I'll get carpal tunnel if I type about how good the wings were in detail, just suffice it to say they were fried perfectly crisp, while still being moist inside.  I can't wait to try the other flavors.  Both of the ones we had were great!  When I mentioned that it's kind of weird to have wings without beer (on a Sunday no less!!) the woman who took our order said they are working on a liquor license.  That would be great if you are so inclined to have a cold tasty adult beverage with your wings.    We got the cinnamon and powdered sugar (each 50 cents extra) with our biscuits and that was a decadent treat to have honey-drizzled warm biscuits and then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on them.  It smelled like my grandma's kitchen on Sunday and they tasted heavenly.    So I think in a way, we did find religion on Sunday.  I'm convinced that if anyone wrote a negative review for this place, they are somehow affiliated with the Long John Silver's right next door, or the Domino's across the street.  Hallelujah for Atl Wings!"}
{"text":"My cousin said these wings were delicious, I was a little skeptical at first having tried Wingstop, Hooters and Buffalo Wild Wings. The restaurant is a little small and it was busy when we got there.  I ordered a ten piece lemon pepper, a ten piece Cajun BBQ and ten piece Chefs special. We also ordered a basket of fries. It was absolutely delicious the wings were perfectly cooked crispy and the sauces were terrific. I absolutely loved these wings, they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Any location you go to the wings are gonna be fire, but this location is the best because of the lady who works the register. I don't know her name but she has caramel skin and wears huge gold hoop earrings. She is always super nice and great with customers!!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!!! Definitely meaty crispy juicy chicken wings... all the luv  ATL wings, Mild, Honey BBQ and Lucky's Sweet Red"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of things about this place so I figured I would give it a try seeing as its just down the street from my house. From looking at the outside you could almost question if this place is even open just for the fact the windows are so tinted and the shopping center it is in. Once you get inside it looks much better, the restaurant while it is small, it was very clean and welcoming. We ordered our food (we tried the garlic parm and honey habanero wings, along with the fried catfish). I agree with the other reviews that their service time is very slow when we first arrived we were the only ones in there and it still took us almost 25min to get our food however the employees were very friendly. I would say the wings were up to par while they were very meaty they weren't amazing in flavor the fried catfish was very good and it a was a very large piece of fish which made it worth the $4.99. Overall I would say their wings were good a little over priced for what they are in my opinion and nothing I could see myself craving in the future but worth going back."}
{"text":"Amazing as always! My boyfriend and I go here all the time they are always fresh and tastes great. There cheesy bacon fries are pretty good too . The buff chicken is both amusing and scary lol"}
{"text":"OH MAN! These wings were DELICIOUS!! Extreme honey habanero. LOVED the flavor. And I am so impressed with how they are cooked. Nice and crispy, but not overcooked and not greasy at all. JUST YUMMY! And the gals who helped me at the counter were just darling!! Really good service and super, super sweet.  The mac and cheese bites weren't anything to write home about... the cheese just isn't good. But hey, what do you want for $2.99? They were tasty, but not to die for by any means. Jalapeño poppers the same thing... just okay. But I would definitely recommend this place for the wings. And I can't wait to go back and try the fish! The gal that worked there raved about it. OH! And I want to try the fried okra! MMMMMMMMMMMM..."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Corey did an amazing job with the customer service! This was the first time we had ate here and the wings were amazing! This will be our new wing spot! Even though he is a Giants fan.. it's okay! I highly recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried out ATL Wings. So happy I did too. The service was really good and my wings cane out fast. Talk about great wings. They were bomb.com! I will be back very soon.  *Phoenix Foodies Approved"}
{"text":"I am a little ashamed to say that I came here to check out the Kool-Aid Fountain Machines and not really so much for the chicken wings.  Much to my disappointment, the KoolAid tasted awful.  Worst KoolAid I've ever had.  However, I did end up getting some wings.. and these wings were amazing!!  You definitely need to get the house ATL flavor!  The people who work here are super friendly too!"}
{"text":"The BEST wings and fries. That's all you need to know. My favs: ATL Style & Lemon Pepper."}
{"text":"Both the food and service are great. The wings are amazing and definitely in my top 3 of best wings in AZ. The food is reasonably priced and wait time is always minimal."}
{"text":"Was good but they are slow at making your wings and not to many  friendly workers mainly the front person"}
{"text":"Goodness gracious, this place makes me blow my diet!! Those ATL style wings & the ATL fries- I simply cannot pass them up. They are sooooo good! I've tried some of the other flavors and they're also good but I keep going back to the ATL. Also go inside and drink Kool-Aid. I mean, it's like reliving your childhood and simply amazing! I wish there were more locations around the valley because it's a little out of the way for us but there are days where no length of drive will stop me from eating there if I'm having a craving!"}
{"text":"Huge fan! I came in during my lunch break and decided to give their chef's special sauce a try. They offer you a sample which is nice so you can taste before you make a final decision. The Chef's Special is a mix of Mild, Garlic Parmesan, and Ranch (I believe). And it was amazing! Their wings are cooked to perfection as well. They have the perfect amount of crisp on the outside without affecting the meatyness on the inside. And they give a good variety of wings and drums. I personally prefer drums, but when it's a mixture of the two it's nice when it's at least an even mixture. I also ordered the fries which I wasn't the biggest fan of. They're thin fries but they're also a big soggy feeling. I wish they were a bit crispier. They kind of remind of in n out fries in the way that they have that limp feeling.  Overall I definitely want to come back and try their other flavored! The place gets retry packed during lunch. Luckily I got there when it was pretty empty but then I was leaving there were people looking around for tables. Great business!"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings, I love them all but spicy ATL is my favorite.  They have discounted wings Tuesday or Wednesday, but everyday they are delicious! Definitely give them a try and you will keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have literally gone 3 times in one week.....  Wings and fries are perfectly crispy and the ATL seasoning is amazing!!   We've had a couple times where we've waited for really long times but the staff is really working hard the entire time and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Their lemon pepper chicken is SO GOOD. I literally lick the bowl. So so so so good!"}
{"text":"What an amazing wing place!!! BEST EVER!!!!  Friendly staff - explained choices!!! Husband loves the 'rubs' - which are flavored spices(?) probably lower in calories. Our NEW favorite place!!! Drink choices - kool-aid on tap is pretty cool! Don't miss this amazing place - affordable & Tuesday specials!!! Let ATL SHOW YOU SOME LOVE!"}
{"text":"I was there just visiting the city for work and I heard the deal on the radio so I went...let's just say i miss them already!"}
{"text":"They have the best wings here. The only problem is that they don't give you celery or carrots with your wings. Most people overlook that. Sometimes I bring my own. Their fries are even better than their wings if you can believe it."}
{"text":"First time at ATL Wings. I arrived at 11:45 on a Friday and there were 10 other guests eating or ordering.  I asked what the ATL style was but she only said: 'That's our house seasonings', which didn't help, so I ordered a six piece medium hot and a drink and the wings arrived in 4 mins. I had heard that ATL had slow service but not today!  The wings were crispy, fully sauced. The Bleu cheese was good, not the cheap stuff you can get. They really need more soft drink options (there were 8, including 3 variations of Pepsi) plus only one size.   I'll try them again."}
{"text":"TERRRRRRIBLE isn't even the word. I called in to place an order to have a rude ass so called manager named Tasha just be blankly rude! Like, there was no reason for her to hang up in our face when asking for a name of the person who took our order. THEN said \"what do you need to know my name for?\" I wanted to try ATL wings for the first time but I will keep my money going to Wingstop until they get rid of TASHA.   Thank you. Btw this was the ATL Wings located in Chandler AZ."}
{"text":"Wow!  Saw a recommendation in the Phoenix magazine so said let's try it - man, the staff was great and the dry ATL wings were amazing - staff was super and let us try both kinds and we ended up ordering 12 of each to take home!  Highly recommend for that wing fix! Not a sit down and dine, drink a beer place but we will be back!"}
{"text":"I cant believe i had not reviewed ATL wings yet.  Anyways they are a must for those who love or even just like wings. They are crispy, moist and always packed with flavor. I have tried their mango habanero, extreme mango habanero and their spicy ATL signature dry rub(its not really dry though).  Their spicy ATL sauce is definitely the winner. It packs so much flavor that you keep dragging the wings in the aluminum tray to get more sauce. Lol  If its your fist time try them on Tuesday when they have their special. That way you can try different ones and at lower cost."}
{"text":"This is what I love about Yelp. I discovered ATL Wings while looking for a new lunch spot for myself and a coworker and ran across this high ranking wing joint. Pictures looked good and based on the reviews we got the Honey Habanero and Parmesan Garlic wings with some onion rings and I had to get the grape Kool-aid. Holy crap! Those were some of the best wings that I have ever had.  Honey Habanero: the sweet honey taste hits ya right away and then a little heat comes in. I was expecting a little more heat but the flavor is so great that is doesn't matter. These a sticky wet finger licking wings.  Parmesan Garlic: the parmesan flavor is intense at first then the garlic kicks in and the two flavors go perfectly together. These are dry wings which went perfect with the saucy honey habanero.   The wings are big and meaty and everything a perfect wing should be. I can't wait to go here again and try the catfish."}
{"text":"Derick K (review from 1/5/17) the customer service is terrible.  I live over ten miles from this establishment and I really wanted ATL wings.  I called in my order and (Saless/April) was eating while taking my order.  When I said I tell everything she advised that I would be found in the ditch.  I laughed however, poor poor customer service.  she had no clue if this was my first experience or what.  That was very unprofessional.  I work in customer service every day and this is unacceptable.  I try to support Black establishments however if this is the service I will receive then unfortunately I cannot on principle support this establishment.  We can and we must do better!!!"}
{"text":"When my wife first had me stop there I was done. Now whenever I am needing a fixing I stopped in. They must put crack in those wings cuz they are so addictive"}
{"text":"I love the wings. Some of the best in the area. Service is generally good as well, with one exception. Today the offender behind the counter wore a red sequin baseball cap was rude to myself and others. Much prefer the smiling happy person that is usually there."}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down the best wings I have had since I have moved here. Cooked to order, with a choice of 18 different seasonings and house made ranch. They have kool-aids and sweet tea freshly made on tap by their fountain machine and you are seriously not gonna find a better place with wings anywhere. They focus on one thing, and they do it absolutely right. My favorite are the dry rub lemon pepper and ATL rub and man, I'm getting hungry just writing this review.  Go get your fingers greasy and enjoy some wings!"}
{"text":"Chicken Wings.  Lots of flavors to choose from and size options.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First off the customer service was just not up to par. Decided to do a call in order and was met by extreme attitude and was told I had the option of paying over the phone, I decided I would rather pay in person since I don't like giving my card number over the phone. The lady hung up on me before I could get an ETA on my food and confirm my order. I called back and was told they would not begin my order until I paid (so what's the point of calling ahead), told them I only lived 5 minutes away and would be there shortly to which they reluctantly agreed to begin my order. On arrival the lady at the counter was very short with us and couldn't wait to have us leave. When we got home the traditional wings were dry and the boneless were soggy. I will say I enjoyed the sauce but that's about it. For the quality and customer service I would also say it's over priced, 2 and a half dozen wings was nearly $30 with no sides or drinks. I am willing to pay extra for my food if I feel the customer service and quality back it up, but that is not the case at ATL Wings."}
{"text":"The first time I had their wings was at the ostrich festival and I fell in love with their wings. So much so that we had to stop in at this location and try them again ! I will say that they are the  best wings in the valley!  It will be my go to place for wings!"}
{"text":"Have always heard about ATL wings, but never went and now I am so upset I haven't tried it sooner. The cashier noticed us struggling to decide and asked if we had never been there before. She gave us a sample of two different sauces, and 2 wings to try. The wings were amazing!!! The sauce on them was perfect. My husband loved the ATL flavor, and I loved Chefs choice and hot! My husband said he wants to go back every single day. We will definitely be back really soon!!"}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere to eat found ATL wings on yelp went there gave it a try they were great. I ordered 12 hot wings and they were smothered. Just the way I like him I hate it when people act like they're say to be in the sauce for someone else to thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place is as legit as they come! Very good wings! My favorite are the ATL style, Garlic Parm, and the Honey BBQ flavored wings. Ask to try samples and they are more than willing to let you try them. There were times when I got a free cup of Kool Aid and extra biscuits! I like to come back often. Make sure you order the biscuits too!"}
{"text":"Really good wings I got the spicy atl and my husband as well... really good flavors I would definitely recommend  it also the cashier women was very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Bone suckin' GOOD!  Best wings I've ever had!!! (Sorry Anchor Bar)  The ATL will blow your freaking mind!  So Flavorful!! Chef's Special - hot but lots of flavors going on!  The Southwest honey habanero rounded out our trio nicely!  I've eaten wings coast to coast- these are numero uno!!!!!  Thanks, Phoenix Magazine for alerting us to ATL's wings-  one of the 75 best dishes in the Valley!  On to #3!!!"}
{"text":"The garlic parmesan wings are definitely awesome only tried two other sets of wings there they were pretty good as well size of the wings definitely good overall 4 stars"}
{"text":"Bomb! These were juicy, cooked til the skin was crisp and delish! The waitress was so helpful and nice as well. Small location, so I hope they intend to grow. Come check them out if you're a wing fan. The ATL style wings are a uniquely flavored dry rub wing. So.dang.good!  We had the dry rub ATL wings... Nice spice (think tasty and savory but no heat) the lemon pepper, which were also great, you could totally get into these and save your fingers from getting saucy. We tried the teriyaki, sweet and savory... So good! The honey chipotle, a sweet heat, the chef special- reminded me of a mild traditional  wing with Italian spices and some parm, medium buffalo (done right... I tasted butter) and my favorite the honey habanero- great sweet heat that is totally edible and won't make you breathe fire.   This place has focused on wings and does them right. Totally worth checking them out and ordering a bunch of flavors. They even make their own dressings in house; they were creamy and well seasoned. You'll also find kool-aid available in a few flavors. I enjoyed the novelty of this but don't like it myself. The kitchen is also in plain view and was obviously clean and well organized. They were frying batches of chicken the whole time I was there. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Have the best wings and great service! My kids love the teriyaki wings and my favorite are the Ranch and Mild, but I am sure all other flavors are great too. We have our new favorite on Tuesday nights with their special deal."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love their wings, especially ATL style. They are tasty and cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of crisp. I hate how greasy their fries are and how gross I feel after eating here.  Yes, I realize the wings are fried and greasy and I don't expect health food, but I wish they had some less greasy side options (slaw, potato salad, etc). The wings are rich in flavor and are hard to resist. They catch up to me though and therefore I don't indulge often. Lastly, we ordered and paid for biscuits bit never got them. We decided to leave it alone though so since we were stuffed from our lunch."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had since moving here a year ago. Crispy, meaty, and tasty. Hadn't had Kool Aid since the 80's. Great service and reasonably priced menu. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Best wings I have ever had. So glad they came to old town. Don't let this one slip you by and we have to keep it here. Dry wings very unique. Not completely dry but by far best I have had. ATL spicy has big time kick and will probably go regular ATL next time. . Garlic Parmesan awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered from them last night thru door dash. The food tasted pretty good but 6 hours later I am sitting here with food poisoning. After reading some reviews here about cleanliness and the quality of the food I wish I would have checked out reviews of this place before ordering. Never coming back and encouraging friends to do the same."}
{"text":"Thanks to ATL Wings I've finally found my chicken wing Soul Mate! Absolutely the best wings and biscuits I've ever had. Not only was the food fantastic, but the staff was fun, energetic, and seemed to really enjoy serving us. Plus they have Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid on tap! I am seriously considering making dinner at ATL a new weekly ritual."}
{"text":"Best wing spot. Love the customer service as well. Never disappointed with this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great wings for a decent price. Especially on Tuesday where they have wing night and offer a discounted rate. The place isn't fancy or anything but they do their wings right. The ATL rub is really good! I haven't had a flavor I didnt like. If you're into koolaid the blue flavor is delicious! The location on southern in Tempe is great."}
{"text":"I love the wings here. Unfortunately, ordering and waiting is typically a huge pain. Phone orders have long hold times (5-10+ minutes) and they seem annoyed, so we usually just give up and go in. Then for some reason we always get there at some break-time and end up waiting about a half-hour for 2 dozen wings. Sure wish we could order ahead more easily, but the wings are definitely worth the wait..."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix on a week long business trip and I had to get my fix for wings. I looked on Yelp and was led here, definitely glad I did. The wings were cooked to order and were nice and fresh. They were sauced to perfection. The staff was very friendly. If I ever return to PHX, I'll defintely come back."}
{"text":"WOW...If you like real HOT wings this is the place to go. They serve up the heat! I tried their Toxic top level sauce today, and it was HOT! I'm a  chilihead, and it's hard to find places that know how to bring the heat, without it being nasty tasting. Next time I'll likely stick with just the Hot version, since my mouth still has heat in it 2 hours after eating the Toxic level.   I'll be back soon! Thanks Alt Wings!"}
{"text":"I really love the wings I've been here twice both times the food was great some of the staff are a little moody but most of them are polite."}
{"text":"This was my first at atl wings on the corner of 51st  ave and northern  ,customer service was terrible, cashier was not attentive or friendly ,the house fries were greesy and stale  Aside the wings were good, ive had better"}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I have ever eaten. Can't wait to go back. My wife didn't like the honey bbq because it was kind of hot. That was the only complaint of the night.  Don't miss out on the sweets at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"They cannot handle the crowd of their own wing night special. The wings are 60 cents on Tuesday and I came to eat on a Tuesday and it was terrible. I waited over 40 mins for my food and my mom waited at least 50. There were lots of puzzles looks in the dining room from people waiting and wondering where there food is. One guy walked out with 2 bags after one of the counter ladies kept going in and out of the kitchen trying to correct his order. Terrible service but the wings are great. Go to the Thomas location.  Much cleaner and better service."}
{"text":"So I just came back to get some wings and although the the quality and flavor is still good. There are a couple things that irked me. First of all the lady with the blonde hair is not really all that friendly. The few times I've been serviced by her she just seems like she doesn't want to be there and is annoyed. Also, the portion for the fries used to be plenty for 2 people. But now it's not even close.... Oh well. I guess you can't have everything."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. Truely a gem, in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great wings at a fair price.  We were in the neighborhood and needed some lunch.  Now we will be making the 15 mile drive just for these wings .  Their ATL dry rub is amazing and the spicy version is great."}
{"text":"Hit or miss.  The honey habanero is the best sauce I've tried.  The regular cayenne style wings (mild, med, hot) are not the best to be honest.  65 cent wings on Tuesdays which is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"I always order the lemon pepper and buffalo wings and they are slap your momma delicious! The lemon pepper wings have soooo much flavor soaked into the chicken! I usually can't even make it out of the parking lot before I start eating them.  They also have great service!"}
{"text":"For being our first time here, the wings were great. Service was fast. Barely anybody here around 5pm but we enjoyed our food. The kool-aid was a bit too sweet for our liking"}
{"text":"Wings were good, a bit over cooked, we ordered 3 separate orders, the boneless were perfect but the sauce we chose tasted heavily of garlic powder, not great. The chefs special sauce tasted like Frank's Red hot and was delicious. The cheese fries are French fries with canned cheese on top, I'd pass on these next time."}
{"text":"I've never been to another wing spot that offers to let you try their wings sauces or rubs by giving you an actual wing. Dry rub ATL Style is outstanding. Lucky's Sweet Red is a close second."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Best wings I have ever had. Wing are fried until they get crispy. I always get ATL seasoning on the wings and get the homemade style fries with ATL seasoning. It can be busy during lunch. If it is busy, the wait is not long."}
{"text":"Really, REALLY good wings!    We're torn as to if they're really better than Long Wong's (down the block), but they are excellent, the fries are magnificent (and one order is PLENTY for two - we bought two orders and have TONS left over). We tried the ATL and the mild; could have gone for medium (mild had a nice little bite, but not too spicy).   The ATL wings have a magnificent flavor, and remind me of the wings on the appetizer menu of the much-missed Baby Kay's. Crispy and meaty and flavorful. Delicious! They are definitely more expensive than Long Wong's, but clearly their passion is wings, plus there's more variety, so we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Fries ATL style highly recommended. Tried BBQ, Hot and ATL dry rub and all were excellent my favorite was the dry rub."}
{"text":"I just happened to try this place out a couple weeks ago on my way home from work. When I arrived, it was extremely busy but their customer service was on point. They efficiently attended to the long line, the full tables plus answering the phone... And I didn't have to wait long for a large to-go order. As for their food, the wings were awesome! We took home the Cajun hot, honey habenero, traditional hot and garlic parmesan. Our favorites were the honey habenero and the Cajun hot. Neither one was very spicy but instead, it had a lot of flavor. We also ordered the bacon cheese fries... Which were legit!  I stopped in for a second time tonight and they did not disappoint. This time, it was not as busy but they were consistent in their communication skills and excellent customer service. The food was delicious. I was able to thank TT (sp?) at the front and Miguel for doing such a great job. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! This was the best wings we have  had in awhile. The honey habanero was so good. Kool aid made my kids day and with a family of six we were able to order 4 different variety of wings.. Of course we are talking 100 wings! I will be recommending ATL wings to friends and family. Great service ."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I was extremely happy with the wings here. We got the garlic parm and medium wings. They were out of this world. My only feedback is that the paper bag ripped when I took them out of the car and we lost a few. So if possible ask for an extra plastic bag to make sure you don't lose your food!"}
{"text":"I must have eaten at this place 10 times on my stay in Phoenix.    In my opinion they have the best wings in AZ.    The lemon pepper,  ranch,  and the spicy ATL are my favorites.    Not to mention the honey biscuits are so good,   throw in some kool aid and you have one great meal.   Not to mention the people behind the counter are super cool.   I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"The wings here are just awesome.  So so good.  Lots of meat and they get them super crispy.  I had the extreme honey habanero, the atl style and the hottest they had (i believe called extreme or toxic).  All were amazing.  The atl are a dry rub and just have a great saltiness to them.  The honey habanero are a great mix of sweet and really hot.  The toxic were a a blazing hot buffalo.  Lips numbs, nose running and very very satisfied.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"Wings are wow here! Great flavors and very big. I would suggest the ATL flavor. It's a secret recipe, can't quite describe it. The service was fast and the manager treated us well, so much we thought she was the owner. Was impressed and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wings are the best I've EVER had. Dry rub is delicious. Crispy outside and juicy inside. I love these wings!! We don't go anywhere else for wings. We have all our love for ATL wings!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Have always had amazing service. The wings are ALWAYS ON POINT. Have referred anyone looking for great wings. Highly recommend the ATL style and the honey habanero. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"First time eating today, lemon pepper 24 count.   My mouth does a happy dance. The fries were hot, athe meat was too & fried. Right. Great staff & fast waiting time.  Flavor is off the chain. Fries were also seasoned great."}
{"text":"I love wings and I am very very picky about them. Let me tell you, their wings are amazing. Nice and crispy & the flavors are to die for! STEPHANIE she is so helpful and always goes the extra money le to assure your experience is wonderful. I call in the orders and she remembers my order  MUST TRY"}
{"text":"Big crispy wings always fresh  Make sure you come early before the lunch rush.  Try all the dry rub flavors.  You won't be disappointed.  I think this is the best wing place in the valley hands down."}
{"text":"I have to write a new review since my previous one was deleted by Yelp, because I didn't write about my experience (which explains why they have such a high rating, if they send Yelp a complaint about every negative review they get, and it gets deleted).  This business is in a very shady plaza, but hey..I got a discount through my job to try the place out, and figured..why not?  As I walked in, I felt like I was at the DMV..filthy floors and tables, but I was getting my food to go so who cares, right? I got to the counter, and ordered my food from the rude lady at the counter. At this point, it wasn't what she said, but her delivery that was rude...as if I was bothering her, by giving her my order. I finished giving her my order and handed over my voucher, which I bought through my work. She rudely went on about having to charge me an 18% gratuity if I took the order Togo instead of eating in. I asked, \"Oh..really? It didn't say anything like that on the voucher?\" She started swinging her neck from side to side, and I quote, \"I've had problems with that company. I can either charge you the 18% or cancel your order, what would you like?\" I was very surprised, considering I had been nothing but polite to her. Needless to say, I cancelled my order and walked out because that attitude will not get my business even if I have heard great things about the food. I've told everyone I know about this experience, and I will continue doing so.  Again...this place belongs in West Phoenix, or better yet..ATL! We demand and appreciate decent customer service when spending our hard earned $ around here!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you, food is amazing of course but the customer service goes beyond what is expected. Turned a frown upside down with a simple gesture and has earned a lifetime of recommendations and referrals now."}
{"text":"Best wings in town hands down! Always fast service, made fresh right there. Tons of different styles and flavors so there is always something good to choose that you'll like. A few unique flavors too so it's. Or just run of the mill food. Kool-aid to drink to add to the feel"}
{"text":"Their wings tasted good. The ATL wings through me off with flavor in all the right ways. I waited to long to try the fries while they were at their best so. Idk. I assume great cause they were still good."}
{"text":"First time last night and everything I ate had me in my feelings. The staff is super cool and the men in the back were hustling. Every wing I had was super juicy and full of flavor..those atl style fries..ohhhh boyyyyyyyy. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus! These wings are FIRE!!! My little girl wanted Panda Express so I went with her next door to get our food. My husband noticed that ATL Wings had just opened next door so he decided to give it a try. We brought our food home, and let's just say that my Panda got put in the fridge. He ordered the lemon pepper wings, and oh my goodness, I can't even put into words how good they were. Normally I hate lemon pepper wings-- I'm more of a hot wing chick, but these right here... oh yes. The prices are decent, and Wednesday's are 60 cent wing days. I am so glad that they replaced the Louisiana Chicken place that used to be there, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time since I work right next door. There wings are to die for, they have so many flavors available, you will never be disappointed.   The customer service is amazing. The short blonde Stephanie always make my experience great and she definitely makes the best chicken salads. All of the cooks are genuinely caring and make every wing to perfection!   There check out time has always been less than 10 minutes. It's a family environment that everyone should try."}
{"text":"My friend from Phoenix swears by this place and I see why. The sauces kinda carry the place. Wings seem to be a bit pricey at almost $1.00 per wing and they don't even offer better deals for buying more. Like, you can buy 6 wings for $5.95 then buy 24 for $23.85. Like, where's the incentive to buy more? You know? Anyway, their sauces were really food. There's no special wing day or anything either like at other establishments. I had the Spicy ATL sauce and the ATL dry rub. They were tasty, but the chicken itself tasted a bit dry as if the wings weren't quite fresh, yet were already cooked then dropped back in the oil to make them fresh. Nonetheless, wings are my weakness and the food was worth what I paid. I'll surely be back to try every single sauce on their menu. We also can't forget the Kool-Aid available as a fountain drink. Amazing to have that sweet drink with the savory flavor of the wings."}
{"text":"My fiance and I are all about our chicken wings, and ATL is as good as it gets. The honey habanero  and garlic Parmesan are our top picks. The spicy tator tots are a MUST have. They're some magical combination of tator tots and jalapeno poppers that I have to order every single time! Also, bonus points for carrying cans of Cactus Cooler."}
{"text":"I love the lady working the front desk. She is good at what she does and is always nice. To everyone saying she isn't, it's probably because you aren't being nice to her! And I always see her working, she might be the manager...the wings are the best wings I've ever had and I now refuse to order wings anywhere else because they will never compare to ATL wings. Good job to everyone who works there!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review for this place. Maybe I have and maybe yelp just get rid of it like they do in time to time. All The Love is 1 of my favorite chicken wing places. Love love love. My personal favorite is their dry rub. I've had most of their flavors and it's been fun experimenting. If you want to taste something before you order it they will give you a sample. What also makes his place spectacular is that they have Kool-Aid on tap. Heaven"}
{"text":"My beautiful wife found this lace for me for valentine's day. She knows I love wings.  If you live crispy on the outside and tender meat on the inside and no breading then this is the place for you. I LOVE THIS PLACE. I have been 3 times since valentine's day and my order keeps getting bigger each day.   The wing like I said above are crispy and meaty. No bread here for me so perfect for low carb or keto diets. You pick your sauce and oder the number you want. Takes about 3-5 minutes to get your oder. Everything is cooked fresh.   The wings have a deep chicken flavor. I prefer the ATI which is the origional flavor. Not spicy, just wonderful savory with deep chicken flavor.   They use a dry run and then all other sauces if you order them that way. They have not spicy, spicy, super spicy, honey habenero, lemon peper and many other flavors. They also have boneless wings. They also have baked.beans which are reply good.  They are also have Kool aid and Pepsi brand sodas, but no coke which was bummer for.me because I am a coke a cola guy. For desert they have a fired dough and honey which was dangerously good.   This place is so good. I hate wings where the skin is rubber. ATL wings are the exact opposite.   If you love wings give it a try. Amazing wings.   The owner is a couple from NYC and they are so friendly and kind.   Foot 5/5. Service 5/5."}
{"text":"The food is great,but the need to brush up on customer service. The place ask you if the can place you on hold when you call,but before you can answer you are already on hold."}
{"text":"There's a ton 5-star reviews for this place, and they (the 5-star reviews) were the thing that really drew me in, other than my lust for hot wings; however, upon experiencing ATL Wings, I am a little perplexed by all of them (the 5-star reviews).  First things first.    This place is counter service with a moderately sized eating area reminiscent of a sub shop in configuration... It's great for carryout or a quick meal.  The wings...  The bone in wings are good.  The sauces are good.  Boneless wings were most likely frozen/pre-breaded, but my kid liked them.  The Ranch and Blue Cheese dipping sauces let a little to be desired, but were good as well.  Everything was good, and just that: Good, not 5-star.  When I think 5-star, I think amazing and unique.  If this place had more going for it in the accouterments department like Booze/Beer/Wine or a more inviting dining area,  I could see 4-stars, but a counter that pushes out good wings, good fries, good sauce and kool-aid just isn't deserving.  I can think of many other places that have at least one type of wings that slays this place:  Four Peaks' off menu habenero hot wings and their top notch blue cheese dipping sauce. Teakwoods' wings - a ton of styles and killing suicide Zipps' wings - tons of style too. Cornish Pasty's Tandoori Wings.  This is just the short list, and all of these places' wings beat ATL and the establishments also offer a whole other level of food, drink, and ambiance to enjoy as well.  Overall, I would hit this place up for a quick lunch or if I needed carryout and I was in the area; however, with just a little more effort one can find better wings."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer said, these guys have wings bigger than most restaurants/bars. They also offer a wide variety of sauces to choose from. We tried the Honey BBQ, Sweet & Tangy and the Cajun Hot. The Honey BBQ is your standard flavor and mild enough for nearly every temperament. The Sweet & Tangy was interesting, but my least favorite of the three. We were told it's a mix of the lemon pepper and another honey-based sauce. My favorite was the Cajun Hot. It didn't sacrifice flavor for heat (bonus points) and complemented the Honey BBQ. I like to go back and forth between a mild and a hot, and those two flavors did the trick. They'll give you one sauce per 5 wings, so I split the 15 pack with my gf. We were so full and didn't need any sides.  Least I forget, you get to wash it all down with your choice of red, blue and purple Kool-Aids that include an extra refill. So good and refreshing. Be ready for that sugar rush! The staff was really friendly and the place was fairly busy for a Sunday afternoon.  Though they do have two TV's up, I wish they were a restaurant or bar. I rarely go somewhere for just wings, but this place might just bring me back once in a while.  Similar establishment: Wingstop (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wingstop-mesa)"}
{"text":"I was worried because it can be kind of hit or miss when trying a new location and especially with wings. But This is definitely a HIT! Staff was friendly and helpful Honey Habanero is amazing. The location is awsome and the bathroom was clean. I tried alot of wings but this joint is the business!"}
{"text":"I've only had this place twice...both times to -go. I have a 20 minute drive back home and these wings were still hot and crispy by the time i got home. Soo good!! I got an 18 pieces ($17.95) split (50 cents extra) with half if them with the \"ATL Style\" dry rub and the \"Red Hot Medium\" on my wings.  So good! I was addicted at first bite!"}
{"text":"These guys are amazing. The food is bomb the service is bomb and the owner is super sweet. We love us some ATL!!"}
{"text":"Awesome meaty and crispy wings. Found my new favorite arizona wing place. Super nice people work there I received a punch card and a free koolaid. Super sweet. Delicious wing sauces too!"}
{"text":"Really good wings. Tons of sauce choices. All kinds of Kool-Aid, which is fun for everyone. Fries are good, but I personally prefer crispier ones. But the family demolished them. Small seating area. Sees to be more for take home. I had a side salad too with my wings that was super yummy. Great wing place for the West side."}
{"text":"The wings here are good, but no one ever answered the phone for me to order ahead of time. Then when I got there and ordered, they messed up my order and actually told me they \"didn't have time\" to fix it.  All the Kool-Aid in the world cant make me forget about horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Good wings.  Good price.  Good fries.  Good portions.  The ATL rub is delicious.  The cajun or seasoned fried are great.  And if Kool Aid is your thing, it's available w/ the combo.  (i'll admit, it was funny to see Kool Aid as a choice of drink the first time I was there.  But hey. Do you)    The order takers have always been pleasant the 4 times I've been here.  Check 'em out if you're in the Arcadia neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I prefer these over Wingstop or any of the other wings places in AZ.  They are always busy but I've never had to wait an excessive amount of time for my food. The order taker is always on point. And they often play 90's music when I'm there.  Can't go wrong with 90's Rnb! Would be 5 stars, but I think they are slightly more expensive than the location in Arcadia. Unless prices went up since I moved to this area"}
{"text":"Entered this small restaurant with high hopes of finding our new wing place. Saw the award posted and the big trophy...which was promising! However the lady at the register did not greet us. She looked right at us and then turned and walked away. She showed something on her phone to the guy at the grill. Hung receipts/orders on the middle island/prep surface. She returned to the register and counter and resumed looking on her phone. No greeting or offer to help.  My husband works in the restaurant business as a manager. He values customer service so much that he refused to spend our money here. We left. Unfortunate really, as he LOVES wings and we eat out a lot! He craves wings at least once a week. This could have been our new wing place. However, due to the lady with the long pink nails, long dark hair in the back and blonde weave in the front - Atl Wings will not receive any of our money. A little training on good customer service could really help this place out."}
{"text":"Came here because of the positive reviews on yelp. Nice and clean inside, big flat screen tv with the football game on, staff was helpful with ordering- I was picking up wings for a party so wanted to get crowd pleasers. There are TONS of flavors to chose from. They included ranch at no cost and my order was ready fast! I had an iced tea while I waited which was only a couple minutes. Noticed they had not one not two but THREE flavors of koolaide in drink machines- fun. Wings were great too- we would come back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"It's an orgasm in you're mouth, makes you're taste buds squirt. Stiffens your tongue right up."}
{"text":"Wings are bomb.com I love the garlic Parmesan, ATL style, and lemon pepper. They're a pretty big wing with modest prices!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Owners are awesome! Koolaid is super sweet just the way I like it! Even though its a drive  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My 1st time here and the wings were amazing! The ladies were really helpful and I thought they were really nice. They had a really long line cuz I'm guessing of the Wing Tuesday pricing. But the line went fast. And the wings were ready pretty fast too. Had a great experience. Will be back next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"The location is great, clean, friendly and seating for 25 or more. I ordered Honey Habanero and Hot chicken wings, with a side of Fried Mac & Cheese bites. The staff was very friendly answered a few questions and delivered my food with a smile.   The wings smelled delicious. The aroma of the traditional Hot is one of my favorite food associated smells. The HH wings had a complex mixture that begged investigation.  The flavor mixture of Honey and Habanero was a real treat. Not too spicy but smooth to boot.  For people on the East Side of the Valley this is worth a stop. No hesitation making the recommendation here!"}
{"text":"So glad this is in Scottsdale! Delicious wings! Lots of meat and cooked perfectly. The \"hot\" sauce was perfectly spiced, not too buttery or watery, and not overly hot."}
{"text":"Great wings for a great price. I ordered take out and will need to go buy new pants this weekend."}
{"text":"They have good wings and great in store service but when I call to order ahead they hardly ever answer the phone, I have to call like 9 times to get through! The wings are amazing tho and would recommend the place to anyone."}
{"text":"ATL wings are by far the best wings in the valley. We've never had bad wings at any of the locations. We love that they're family owned. They make their own homemade blue cheese and it excellent. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Solid wings selection! Reminds me of what wing places used to be. .75 cent wings on some days. Try all the flavors they have tons!"}
{"text":"I love hot wings. It's annoying to go out to eat places and order the \"hot\" wings and they're barely mild. I ordered the Cajun hot wings from ATL and it was the perfect blend of spice and flavor. The wings were meaty and cooked to perfection. I totally get the hype now and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wings are out of this world.  ATL style and Chef's Special are ridiculous good.  They let me sample two different flavors by just giving me two whole wings.  They were super friendly."}
{"text":"The girl that they have working today is just on her phone. I'm staring right at her. Just on her phone and eating Mcdonalds  or is it Carl's Jr and cutting veggies....not so sanitary I vetoed the veggies today. She said nothing when I was ordering. No greeting just so cold. But shit life can be worse! I'm almost afraid to ask for another item. But I can do without ..."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best wing place I have found so far in this state. The wings are of big size and really meaty. I have had quite a few flavors now and all of them have been excellent. If you are looking for wings don't hesitate on checking this place out!"}
{"text":"only thing better than the wings is the staff! great customer service! hot wings and lemon dry rub a maze ing!!!"}
{"text":"Great wings, plenty of flavors to choose from too.  I go here usually after my barber cut next door.  Perfect for a quick light snack or for a full meal that'll make you want to hit the gym that day, lol."}
{"text":"Wings are crispy. Variety of sauces and rubs.  But the restaurant lacks workers and organization. Called in for a to-go order at 7:45 (which took 3 tries before getting a person on the other side), went into pick up at 8:15, and didn't walk out until 8:40.   There was a line to the front door which I didn't mind waiting in since there was only one register. When I got up there to pay, the person couldn't find my order because it was place under the wrong name. And when she found my order, I noticed that she put the ticket up to be made (behind all the other people that walked in)?? Is that how restaurants are run now? What is the point of calling in ahead of time? Apparently, that's how it works here. But if you are able to somehow give them your credit card number before they rush you off the phone, then maybe just maybe your order will be ready for pick up when you get there. Fortunately, I won't be back to find that out."}
{"text":"Sketchy on the outside, but as they say, it's what's on the inside that counts. I had a 10 piece wing combo plate with 2 sauce choices; Honey Habanero and Citrus Chipotle. The wings were drowning in sauce.  Soooo juicy and delicious.  The chicken is cooked perfectly.  Not too greasy, cooked through, the chicken was moist and tender.  You will not leave here hungry.  These wings had some meat on them.  I will be going back to try all 18 flavors. Love the selection of bottomless Kool-Aid flavors.  I also had the (made from scratch) sweet corn bites.  I think they were made with grits inside which made them sweet as pie."}
{"text":"The wings are good but customer service sucks ! They stop answering their phone 8:30 i called tonight at 8:24 the guy answers puts me on hold for 4 minutes and hangs up on me i call again and he answers the phone and hangs up this has happened several times. I will not be coming back to that location hopefully the other locations are better managed."}
{"text":"I had the honey habanero wings, my son had Cajun BBQ and both were delicious! Wings are crispy perfect and the ranch is even hella good. The cheese fries with bacon tasted like they fresh cut the fries themselves and I appreciate that. $22 for a dozen wings, side salad, fries and two drinks not to shabby. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the 1st time yesterday.  And being a huge wing lover (especially super spicy ones),  I have to say I was really impressed with the entire experience.  The staff were super friendly and our to go order came out with just a 10 min wait. The wings were perfectly cooked, & all 6 of the sauces I tried were delicious,  even the extreme habanero & toxic, they were the perfect heat level for this spicy eating champion. I would just make one suggestion... to expand their menu, it's not very big. I had to stop somewhere else on my way home to pick up something to go with my wings. But I definitely will be back the next I'm in the mood for just wings."}
{"text":"I joined a couple of my coworkers for lunch today at ATL wings and am so glad I did! The wings were absolutely amazing!  I have to say I am very surprised that people have mentioned a bad experience with the people who work here. They were so friendly to me; going above and beyond to provide great service. The restaurant was clean. And most importantly, our food came out within 10 minutes.  To the person who said they should be in west phoenix or better yet ATL, you should be ashamed of yourself! ATL Wings- I'm glad you are there and hope you will expand and add more locations."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is my favorite place to go for hot wings! Authentic buffalo sauce, crispy wings and the blue cheese is on point! How about that kool-aid on tap??  This place blows long wongs out of the water!!"}
{"text":"The King Of Wings.  I really love wings and ATL Wings is the \"King of Wings\". This was my first visit to ATL Wings however, it won't be my last.    ATL Wings has a casual vibe. The restaurant is spacious, colorful, clean and the menu is posted above the register. Diners order at the counter, take a seat, and wait for their meal to be delivered.   The menu at ATL Wings is straight-forward.  You can choose either traditional or boneless wings, select how many you want, and choose a flavor. Simple as that. On the recommendation of a co-worker I ordered  Honey Barbecue sauce and the Garlic Parmesan (dry rub).  Both style wings (sauced and dry)were delicious. However, I preferred the ATL style to the sauced wings. These wings are meaty, tender, crunchy, and coated with a flavorful seasoning. I could have ate wings all day. ATL  wings serves their wings  with your choice of Homemade Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing. However, these wings are so flavorful I didn't need any dressing.   I couldn't let this opportunity pass by without trying the homemade biscuits. So, I ordered a two piece honey biscuit to accompany my wings. All I have to say is, these are no ordinary \"biscuits\". The biscuits at ATL Wings are smothered in honey and powdered sugar and served piping hot. These biscuits are more like sweet flavorful donuts.   I am looking forward my next visit to ATL Wings and more of those biscuits."}
{"text":"Best Wings EVER! The ATL style was so good. The flavor just hits all the senses. Prices weren't too bad but the quality was superb. I went in on a Friday night and it was surprising slow, it made for some great conversation with the guy behind the counter. He let me try a variety of the sauces. I can't wait to come back to ATL Wings!"}
{"text":"ATL Wings is a new Scottsdale treasure. I'm so happy I no longer have to drive across town for a great wing place. I ordered honey habanero and lemon pepper wings. The wings were crispy, but not dry, and very flavorful. They did not disappoint. But, I do wish they came with carrots and or celery.  In addition, the staff is friendly. There is ample room to sit indoor or outside on the patio. The best part is that they are located just 4 minutes from Scottsdale Fashion Square. I now have a new go-to for a quick snack after a day of shopping. I highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Back again after many months and not because I didn't want to return sooner.  They have not lost their touch!!!  Great tasting and I must say plump generous sized wings cooked properly and shaken with their numerous and very tasty sauces.  To close with their honey biscuits is to end a meal with a smile!  I continue to do take out so I can get my celery fix which they don't provide but they do give you a 75 cent wing on Tuesdays and that's when I go and go and go.  Don't miss it -"}
{"text":"Wings are big and they haven't plenty to choose from and very quick at serving. Tuesday's wings are half off!"}
{"text":"I have tried their wings many times, I have finally given up. If you like your wings well well done then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I just fell in love with this place. It is a 45 minute drive from our house that I would happily make DAILY to eat here.  I am going dream about the honey habanero wings and the honey biscuits.   On a Friday night, we did not wait long for our food and found a table quickly. The owners, Mike and Cianna, are so kind and really made us feel welcome. The staff is also great and very attentive.  Try this place! I'm already excited to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious, the owner is super friendly and the food I just cannot rave enough about my belly was completely happy"}
{"text":"It's a staple for our team to run over to ATL and get some good ol wings. I've been here probably 10 times and usually get the atl dry rub and chefs special. Those are my favorites. The reason for the 4 star is I'm pretty sure I got sick on a batch of wings a while back so I stopped going for a sec but couldn't resist the tempting wings. Will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Great tasting wings and a good size. I have been to many wing spots in AZ and I have say this place is the best. Don't forget the hotcakes they are phenomenal"}
{"text":"Wings: The Cajun Hot wings are on par with the best I've ever had (Roman's VI in Concord, OH). The medium were tasty too but the Cajun has an added depth of flavor I haven't found anywhere locally. There is an extra $0.50 charge to split the order to two sauces.  Sides: The seasoned fries (known as ATL fries) were good and the portion was large enough for 2-3 diners.  Drinks: I will say their soda mixture is a little off, so it may be best to stick to one of the three Kool-Aid flavors/colors. Ambiance: basic and about you'd expect with several tables/chairs. I dined at 11:45 and the place was clean.  Overall: the wings are 4.5 stars and deduct 0.5 star for sub par soda quality I will surely come back for more wings, though."}
{"text":"Bomb ass fries and the honey bbq wings are amazing. Definitely family friendly, we go every other weekend and ATL never fails to satisfy our tastebuds... keep up the good work #PiNONandBeNitezfamily"}
{"text":"Great place for wings. Great size and plenty of sauce choices. Even has a cool Kool aid dispenser fountain."}
{"text":"Came in to try the wings here after hearing good things about this place.. Safe to say they definately came through. Wings were nice and crispy, hot! Customer service was good as well, and spot was pretty clean. It's worth checking out for yourself."}
{"text":"Best wing spot in Arizona, we come here every Tuesday for the wing deal! I would highly recommend the extreme honey habenero or the cajun bbq, they're both amazing.   The staff is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"My go to for wings. So many great flavors. Get the atl style fry's for a side!! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in because I kept hearing amazing reviews on the place. The female cashier was very rude & had a attitude for no reason had horrible customer service . I would never go back to this place again left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Love this place! The wings are crispy and huge. You got to try the Cajun hot if you like spicy wings and the seasoned are really good too. Tried the catfish sandwich on this trip was surprised that it came on regular sliced bread. It didn't matter though the catfish itself was cooked perfect. I bought a bottle of the Cajun hot sauce and threw it on there...so good."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in here on a Friday for lunch since I get off at noon on Friday's. I'm always looking for a good place for wings too. I came in and there was only another couple in there eating so I didn't have a wait at all. There are a ton of options to pick from. I knew I wanted traditional wings (not boneless) and extra crispy and normally I get mild sauce so that's what I went with. Well, a few minutes later 6 piping hot saucy wings and a side of ranch were placed in front of me. They were so hot I had to wait a few minutes to eat them. A few other customers had come in and you could tell it was their first time. Well, one of the guys explained the dry rubs, bbq and sauces to her and asked if they wanted a sample of the ATL flavoring wing which is what they are known for (ATL = All The Love) and they sampled some of the other sauces while they made up their mind. I wish I would have know this because I would have sampled a few that I'm not familiar with. Well, I started talking to the guy that offered a sample wing and he did the same for me as I told him it was my first time there. Oh my god was it the BEST wing/flavoring I've every had!!!! I wish I would of had that wing prior to ordering as that's what I would have ordered (just means I gotta go back now).   Everyone was friendly but the girl that took the orders was a little quiet and didn't explain anything about the spices/rubs/sauces while the gentleman who offered the samples and explained the menu to customers was awesome. He made everyone smile!  I am looking forward to coming back soon for some more ATL Wings!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't even had my first order yet and I'm writing a review based off the ATL wing sample that I had, it's that good!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time coming back here  so i wanted to see what some other wings tasted like from here. I went with the Cajun hot an sweet potato fries. These were on point competing with long wongs which is right down the street."}
{"text":"This place has great food. The service was exceptional as well. They gave us some samples and it worked!  We got to try a couple things we may not have ordered otherwise and they were very good. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Crispy wings, great fries, amazing ranch, KOOL-AID! Does it get much better? Honey habanero are definitely my favorite wings but most all of them I have tried have been good. Best wing spot in Phoenix in my opinion."}
{"text":"My friend Eric has been nagging me to come here forever so today we met so I could see what the fuss was all about. I ordered a 10 piece all flats and a drink. Go to fill up my drink and they have Kool Aid! I haven't had this stuff for years so I was immediately happy. Got my wings and DAMN they were good, crispy and meaty and cooked perfectly. Very happy and will come back for sure."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already. Hands down, Best wings I've eaten. Juicy chicken on the inside and the perfect amount of crisp on the outside. I don't know how they do it but they just do it. Fries are on point (ATL style). Great variety of wing flavors, whether you like wet sauces or dry rubs, PERFECT!!! I'm stuck on that -Chef Special- flavor. Dam, they even got the ranch and bleu cheese on lock. You know some places serve that fake ass ranch but not this spot. Oh, and they got Kool-Aid on tap. Food is worth Every penny. Only thing I miss, they use to have seafood: fried shrimp and fried talapia sandwiches. But All-In-All, they don't miss a beat"}
{"text":"It's our 1st time , I ordered the 3pc for smaller appetites ...I regret not ordering more! Love the lemon pepper wings! The fries are great too!"}
{"text":"Easily the best wings I've ever had. The wings are delicious. Straight up the only good thing about this place. They never answer the phone for call ahead orders, if they do they put you on hold and never pick back up. The workers treat you like dirt. Very rude and condescending and definitely make you feel as if you're not welcome. Good food will only keep you open for so long."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff! They were very patient with us as I tried to figure out what flavor I wanted. They let me try a couple of the sauces and let my friend try a chicken wing since she was new and asking about one of the flavors! So generous! The chicken wings are nice and crispy. I had the extreme honey habanero and Spicy ATL wings. Both AMAZING and a REAL kick! Love it. They aren't playing around there! When you order a side it comes with a free drink, so that is a bonus as well. I highly recommend their ALT fries. They were huge! I would share with a friend. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Best wings I have ever had...and I am from Texas, the BBQ capital! I live their music, and love to see a black business that encourages and supports their black youths! I love the wings (always get Spicy ATL), I love the fries (always get ATL seasoning on them), and the honey biscuits with powdered sugar is to die for! I am just waiting for 11am so I can get me some wings! The only objection I have is their customer service could use some attention. Nothing too bad to the point where I feel offended or will stop coming in, but there were a couple of conversations that probably shouldn't of been discussed in the front around customers...also sometimes they be cussing loud which is fine by me but some people could be offended. I love coming in the mornings when the owners there cooking and taking orders....everyone is in their place but things do get loose when he is not there. I am a manager so these are things I noticed. But again, I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"''This is the joint  my opinion better than wing stop  and that use to be my favorite!! The Atl dry rub in smack city!! grape coolaid was low but I got the last bit also smackin!! and the biscuits caught me off guard they're kinda more like doughnuts still  definitely a weekly eat out type spot"}
{"text":"YESSIR! It's a shame (or a blessing) this place isn't close to me... The people here are super friendly and the food is on point!  Had the mac and cheese bites... pretty much made me want to slap someone in the face because of the fried cheesy goodness. My favorite flavors so far are the seasoned and parmesan garlic wings!"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews, but HAD to for this place. I LOVE this place. The wings are the best I ever had. Ever. I am a wing buff too, Like I can eat all kinds of wings, from any place, even the worse wings are a good meal to me compared to a burger. Okay so I like wings. A Lot.  I am SOOO glad we tried this place. I read the reviews here before I went, was a little unsure due to some of the bad ones, but the good ones sent me over to the store. Since my first visit I have been there 4 times in one month. I don't plan on stopping soon. I have tried almost all the flavors now. My favorites...ATL style for dry rub wings, and a toss up for buffalo medium, LOVE me some buffalo wings, and the honey habanero are superb. BUT trust me you will not be disappointed with whatever flavor you get, BBQ teriyaki, sweet, garlic all yum! Just go there.  Customer service is also really great. Not a fancy place but for wings it's the spot. I haven't tried anything else on the menu except wings. I will not go anywhere else for wings, ever again."}
{"text":"My first experience with this location was amazing. I tried their Cajun hot traditional wings (extra crispy, extra wet) with fries which were both to die for. However, this review is based on my second visit and the treatment I received from the \"general manager\" Stephanie. I wish I could give 0 stars.   I took 4 of my family members that were from out of town to try this place, I had been raving about it. Upon arriving last Saturday, their systems were down and were only taking cash. No problem, things happen. We went to the Walmart ATM just down the street to pull out cash and my car ended up getting backed into by another car. 45 minutes after dealing with the car accident, we were back at ATL wings.   I went to order my Cajun hot wings and they were out of that sauce. My annoyance started here. I then settled and ordered the regular hot wings extra crispy, extra wet, with fries. My family proceeded to order and when I wanted to go to the bathroom, it was out of order, JUST like it was 2 weeks ago. My whole family wanted Pepsi, the dispenser was only dispensing clear liquid. When we notified the employees, they told us, \"they'd take care of it right away.\" We never got our Pepsi that day because the employees never changed the dispenser.   Now for the food. My wings came out neither extra crispy nor extra wet. The fries tasted like they had been sitting for 10 minutes before served to us, and my sisters order was completely wrong so she had to wait another 20 minutes for her correct order. No employee showed a sense of urgency here OR compassion. We all saw an employee sitting on the counter that contained he ketchup, wipes, and silverware eating wings while we were waiting for my sisters food.   I called to speak to a manager, Stephanie, and explained my experience with that location. When I told her the bathroom was out of order, she told me she had been out of town and couldn't get to it. So when I asked why it had been out of order 2 weeks prior, she proceeded to tell me, \"we get a lot of homeless people coming in and out and using the bathroom and it's hard to keep track when we get so busy and we had someone almost overdose there was blood everywhere it was so horrible.\" I am all for compassion, but that is not my problem. When I asked about the Cajun hot and the empty Pepsi, she told me, \"we hire a lot of young and inexperienced employees so they just don't know sometimes and I'm honestly like the nicest person that works here so I wasn't there the day you came in hahahaha.\" Honestly verbatim. I wish I had the conversation recorded for evidence.   DISCLAIMER: I HATE writing bad reviews on yelp but I tried to reach out to get some answers and Stephanie was full of excuses and started to raise her voice with me when I asked what her excuses had anything to do with running an efficient business. She is very unprofessional and rude. Take your money and your stomach somewhere else."}
{"text":"These wings are bomb. I got honey BBQ & lemon pepper and they were both amazing. I wanted to go back the next day. Their seasoned fries are super good especially with cheese! They have a Kool Aid bar with different flavors of koolaid and my boyfriend liked the Spicy ATL wings he got."}
{"text":"After reading a nice review in the Phoenix New Times magazine, my wife and I decide to try ATL wings. Located on the southwest corner of 40th street and Thomas, the restaurant is easy to find and has a large sign visible from the roadway. The inside is clean and proudly boasts the A rating from the health department. The staff were all super-friendly (and displayed some excellent tattoos!)   Three flat screen monitors show the menu over the ordering counter (I love this!). They specialize in wings, so the menu is fairly limited. This is by design. The theory is rather than offer a ton of variety that is just 'okay,' they want to focus on one main item and do it really well! Therefore, the menu lists just chicken wings (bone-in or boneless), salads, fries, pancakes, biscuits and drinks. That is IT (apart from the ranch or blue cheese dressings/dipping sauces).  They have three different styles of wing - BBQ, HOT WING and DRY RUB. There are several flavor variations you can select under each style. We were puzzled what the ATL dry rub tasted like, since it has no description or point of reference. They asked if we would like to try it and offered us two chicken wings, free to taste. That was unexpected and the ATL dry rub was unlike the flavor of any chicken wing I've tasted before it. It was good, though, and so we ordered 10 wings with the ATL dry rub and 10 wings medium. We also ordered two fountain drinks and an order of the biscuits.   We paid at the counter, they gave us our self-serve drink cups, wrote my name on the receipt, told us to sit anywhere we like and they would bring the food out to us shortly.  The fountain machine is Coke products (yay!) and they also have tea (sweetened and un-sweetened)and three different flavors of Kool-Aid to choose from.  Just finishing filling our drinks and putting the lids and straws on our cups, when our order was being served! (Apparently, they pre-cook the wings about 3/4's of the way, then remove them. When you order, the wings go back in to cook for 3 more minutes, and then they're done! Don't worry, they don't let partially cooked wings sit out all day until you order them. Just like KFC, Popeye's, Church's Chicken and other fast-food chicken restaurants, pre-prepared menu items are 'under a clock.')   We don't like wet, soggy wings. Places that cook them in ovens or broilers often have this undesirable, gummy-like, chicken texture. I like my wings to be firm and a little dry. Let the sauce and my saliva draw out the texture and flavor of the chicken. I have to ask most places to make my wings crispy. But not here. That's the way come out by default and, I'm told, there are some customers who request they cook them even longer! God bless America! :)  I'm happy to report the wings were served piping hot from the fryer and the ATL dry rub tasted better and better the more I ate it. I can't figure out what's in it other than butter. Its a weird taste, but I kinda like it. The medium wings tasted really hot (spicy) but as I ate more them, I guess I started to become numb to it. I think next time mild will be my choice. Some places (native new yorker) consider mild to mean butter-sauce only. Yech. Mild is meant to refer to the HEAT. A butter-sauce does not define MILD-HEAT. A butter-sauce only defines NO HEAT! Anyway, the point is, the mild at ATL means MILD-HEAT (not just butter-sauce).  The biscuits are not what I would call biscuits. They are more like tiny Beignets or two-bite pastries. Just imagine a cinnamon-flavored donut hole, covered with powdered sugar, sitting in a shallow puddle of honey. Sounds good, right? SPOILER ALERT!!! It is!  I'm excited they opened a west side location on 51st Ave and Northern!!! YAY!!!  I only have one minor complaint about this visit. The wings should have been served with celery to help cut the heat and refresh the palette between bites.  The total was $20, which is about right for a lunch for two and we certainly did not leave hungry!  On Tuesdays, you can get sixty-five cent wings if you sign up for their special offers by texting \"ATL\" to 60259.   ATL is not meant to refer to Atlanta (sorry, Atlanta airport!) ATL stands for All The Luv."}

{"text":"We are so glad we stopped at ATL Wings. Great service and great food!!! They treated us like they've known us for years. The ATL dry rub is delicious. We will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Love the wings!! 18 different flavors, Kool-aid from the fountain!! No place compares to the wings from here. Customer service from CeCe and wings cooked by Pablo! All I can say is thank you Lord!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to have quality wings, this is a great place to go! I love the amount of options offered."}
{"text":"What does a guy look for in a wing?  Crispy?  Yes.  Flavorful options?  Indeed.  Healthy size?  Sure.  Kool Aid on the side?  Why not?  Listen, the only reason ATL Wings isn't getting a 5th star today is the fact that we ordered them to go and then waited for 45 minutes.  I think they had a couple people call in sick, or something, but that's just too long to ask anyone to wait with all those smells punching you in the nose-hole.    I tried the Mac n' Cheese bites, they were good.  The Honey Biscuits reminded me of mini-scones from the fair where I grew up in Idaho - MUST ORDER!  I will be back - but you better believe I'll call ahead with my order to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Wings were pretty yummy. I got seasoned wings and my boyfriend got ranch wings. They were both very well seasoned and not saucy which I loved. French fries were good and large big enough to share. Only downside is the seasoned wings were very greasy...but we will be back."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place atleast 4 stars, good food. although they dont answer their phone, therefore my entire office cannot order our lunch."}
{"text":"I have been really excited to eat at ATL Wings. I've heard nothing but great things about the place. But my experience was different. It wasn't extremely busy when I walked in to order and it didn't take much time to get my order in. One of the problems was that it took over 30 minutes to get my food. All I ordered was 10 wings and a Cajan fry. The wings were below average compared to others and the fries were not good as well. They also did not have any forks and seemed pretty under staffed. Like I said I have been really excited to eat at ATL but after my experience I will not go back at all."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times but the past few experiences haven't been great. Twice I called the Glendale location and was told to hold for my to go order. No big deal I know they're busy. However I can hear what is being said and after being on hold for at least 7 min both attempts on different days I hung up. There was no reason I should've been on hold for that long. After being forgotten on the phone both times at the Glendale location I called the Phoenix location and they took my order immediately. This last visit I called ahead before I got off work. After driving through crazy traffic I arrive to pick my food up at the Phoenix location and it's not ready. I had to wait another 15+ min after driving over an hour through traffic to pick food up. My fries were hard, cold and greasy. My boneless wings were good though.   I'll still visit this place because I love the food. Just wish my past few visits had been a lot better."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in around 11:30.  The cashier was very pleasant and explained how to order.  We ended up ordering a dozen ATL wings and a dozen ATL \"Hot\" wings with soda's. Seating is open table. Accoutrements are self serve.  There is a soda fountain station, as well as Ice Tea and Kool Aid. The wings were served quickly, hot and tasted excellent.  I like them hot and zesty and that's what I got. Each order came with ranch dressing. We arrived and ordered just in time as the lunch crowd started showing up and the line extended to the front door. Tuesday is 75 cents wings so expect it to be busy.  ATL offers a host of flavors to augment anyone's taste buds.  We both agreed that ATL is our new favorite place for wings!"}
{"text":"Do not miss this place. Good food, friendly people, nice place to hangout! Wings are great and consistently great! My favorite flavors are garlic Parmesan and mango habanero. When i used to live in Arizona, I came here almost every week. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Super stoked to have a proper wings joint in my area! Had my first go at ATL Wings today and I think they've converted me from my old go-to. Lots of flavors to pick from (I'm a huge fan of dry rubs and it's great to actually have more than 2-3 options for once), the wings are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, their housemade bleu cheese is excellent, and the staff was super friendly and accommodating.  Also, 3 flavors of Kool-Aid on deck - gotta love it"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there for lunch today.  When we walked through the door we were immediately greeted.  I had the honey habanero wings and my wife had the hot wings.  They were cooked perfectly!  The skin was crispy and sauced perfectly.  We also got a side of mac n cheese bites, onion rings and fries.  All of the sides were delicious especially he mac n cheese bites which I highly recommend.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings in Arizona! I tried dozens of supposed great wing spots before trying ATL and have since stopped searching. It doesn't get much better than these wings. Venezias is close because of the great pairing with great pizza, but as far as good ol' buffalo wings, you can't beat ATL. Trust me."}
{"text":"A friendly place. The staff are really nice. They don't rush you to make your order and helps explain the menu. The garlic Parmesan tastes great! I like that they don't make the wings too oily and they give enough to make you full. Pricing is pretty okay, I wish they gave out some celery and carrots though! They do only give you one dipping sauce which is 75 cents each and you have to ask for more and pay for more if you want some. Overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"Just had our first rounds of wings last night! We did not go in, my brother brought them home for a family dinner we were having. We had the ATL, Citrus Chipotle and Garlic Parmesan and they were to die for. I am a wing fanatic. I love them very much. I was pleased to see they were BIG, plump and crispy. Some other places we go, I feel we get skimped out on these mini wings that don't fill you up and are not worth the price.  This place is NOT that place. My brother and sister in law go every week now and are hooked. My Mom who is a picky eater even loved them. I cannot wait to go back and try again!"}
{"text":"New favorite wing joint. Well it's the best that's the closest. They make a good wing. What more can I say? They price it at $1 per wing and buying more doesn't give you any discounts until you get into the huge party orders. That being said wings are cheaper on Tuesday. They don't advertise it. I found it out by accident when I noticed my bill was cheaper. My favorite flavors are hot, ATL spicy, lemon pepper, and garlic parmesan. They are almost perfect in every way but they don't have online ordering. They can take orders over the phone but they have a \"don't make it till you pay policy\" and I don't give my card over the phone. I understand them doing this but with no online option it seems silly. The staff is friendly but a little slow. They tend to prioritize talking to each other than taking your order."}
{"text":"Really good wings! Definitely more pricy than other places, but wings are huge. Good flavor and cooked just right. Food takes a while to come out, but you can't rush perfection. Staff was decently friendly but thats why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Their wings are AMAZING! BWWs used to be my go to wing spot, and only because their sauces were solid. But after trying ATL, I'll never go back! I stopped in after the gym with my GF, and ordered 18 wings, thinking I'd eat most of them, but I ended up almost fighting over getting a fair share! We couldn't get enough! I've been here a few times, and they're busy, but they deserve all the success! Easily the best wings in the valley! No question!"}
{"text":"These wings are delicious! And the fries are so good! I am so glad my husband decided to try this place out! Will definitely make this a regular spot for wings :)"}
{"text":"I know the food is good but if you can't match it with good service, you aren't worth a dime. I called in an order at 6:15pm. They asked if I wanted to pay over the phone or in person. I said in person. End of conversation.   They failed to inform me that if I don't pay ahead of time, the order is not made. I just spent 45 minutes waiting for food. What's the point of even calling it in early if you don't tell us that if it's not paid, then it won't be made?  That's no way to do business and it's very upsetting especially from my favorite wing place. Sad to say, I won't be back and I will go the extra length to tell my friends and family about this experience.   Thanks for literally doing everything possible to fail us. We had a great time watching people in line before us get served before us even though we asked politely to have an order prepped.   Absolute fail."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best wings!  So many different great sauces and awesome dry rubs too!  Seriously crave these wings, nice and crispy!"}
{"text":"These are some of the best wings around. Always hot and crispy.  Service is excellent and very friendly and laid back. They have so many sauce options to choose from. Only a few sides so come if you want great wings. The sweet red sauce is the best!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this hidden jem!!! The wings are fantastic. If your in the area & craving chicken wings Look No Further. I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"I was tired of ordering Mexican food and wanted wings and it's the 2nd time I'd seen the name. Food was AMAZING!!! Everyone who visits me will HAVE to eat there. (Lemon pepper wings & ATL fries.. LIFE)"}
{"text":"The only wings I like from ATL are the ATL style wings other than those not a fan but their ATL style French fries are where it's at. By far the best French fries ever recommend to do choose fry also one con about this place is that they only give you one small ass ranch for however big of an order you get sometimes you don't get ranch at all and they charge a dollar for a little ass ranch container that's the only con other than that it's a good place"}
{"text":"The ATL dry rub is the best wings you can get. Buttery and delicious. Wings are also super crispy and chicken is delicious. I love ATL wings and I recommend everyone checks it out. Great local dive. Go here and enjoy a fun atmosphere and great food. Also try their biscuits, with honey and powder sugar"}
{"text":"Disastrous. Poor service. The workers obviously don't care about their customers; their outward attitude is disgusting to the food service industry. Giving this establishment 1 star is generous."}
{"text":"This is the bomb! Don't try to call in a order because they're too busy to answer the phone. That's how good the wings are. Good music and very polite and courteous young workers.. will definitely visit again..."}
{"text":"Man oh man, what can I say. ATL wings is my top pick if you are ever feel like eating some wings. Their wings were way better than other places that sell wings and their prices are pretty much the same as other places as well. First off, the staff was amazing and did whatever they could to ensure your time there was a delicious one. They were all nice and they even let me sample a chicken wing with their ATL style dry rub to make sure that's the one I wanted. There is literally no other place that lets you sample sauces so you know which ones to get. Secondly, from the time I paid until the time the food came out, it only took ~10 minutes or less for my wings to come to me. That is pretty good timing if I had to say because another wing place like Wingstop will take ~20 minutes or more. Moving on to the food, it was crunchy, flavorful, and very pleasing on my tastebuds. The main thing that sets these wings apart from others is the special dry rubs or different sauces. Those sauces and rubs just set the taste on another level and the flavor just explodes in your mouth with each bite. I most definitely recommend anyone else that likes wings to try this place ASAP."}
{"text":"Love everything about it. Service is great, atmosphere is fun and unique, staff is helpful. Best wings I've had in years!"}
{"text":"Solid choice when you're craving some wings. I usually stop in here ever couple of weeks. I get the chef's special and garlic parm whenever I go. I'm not usually a fan of boneless, but I decided to give them a try for the first time. I almost like them more than the bone in. The only reason why I didn't give them a five star is that sometimes I find the wings to be a little tough and chewy. Otherwise, they're flavors and the size of the wings are worth stopping for."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but with the changes they \"had\" to make I no longer visit ATL. Found a new favorite place Wingstop!! Their food has gone down and the service isn't great and I feel like I'm walking into a dark bar than a restaurant  I wish they would bring back their original menu and service!!!"}
{"text":"I did not expect what I ate. The garlic parm wings are the best wings I have ever had. The biscuits were a delicious surprise. The fries are also delicious. Service was average but not rude. Docking 1 star because I saw a employee fill the kool-aid container and threw the lid on the floor and put it back on the container. ; ("}
{"text":"Went looking for some hot and new wings and found them at ATL wings. All The Love. I had the ATL sauce and hubby had spicy ATL. Both were Very good. The sauce was a little thin but became an added bonus cuz the fries soaked it up. And they had kool aid. Purple,blue and red."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best wings I've ever had, but there is one thing holding me back from a 5 star review.  The first time I visited the staff was extremely helpful, offered me samples, and the wings were absolutely amazing.  However, having had such a good experience, I brought my entire family back that weekend.  This time, the girl taking our order was rude, like we were bothering her.  It seemed like a really long time for the food to come out, and half of the wings were lukewarm and getting soggy (so were the fries and biscuits).  The other half of the wings were hot and amazing, so I'm torn because I don't yet know if this is standard or just a bad day.  My guess is that they forgot something, and left most of the order sitting there getting cold instead of giving us the hot and fresh food, and bringing us the rest when it was done.    If my next visit goes well, I'll definitely update my review."}
{"text":"To save you time I summed up this review into three words at the bottom, otherwise if you are like me-- an overanalytical freak that needs a reason behind everything, read the review in it's entirety:  Wings. One of the many carnivorous items that strike out any thought of becoming a vegan. Who knew that deep frying the useless flight devices of chickens would become such a cornerstone in American restaurants and football games?  Wings are amazing.  What makes a great wing is of course it's sauce, texture and size.  It's indeed a rare occasion when an establishment meets all three.  ATL wings soars in this arena above and beyond the competition.  Size-  A pet peeve of mine is when I get tossed a plate of wings that are so tiny  they look like they came from a preggo chicken's embryo. These wings are BIG.  Much bigger than other great places such as Native New Yorker.  Texture- What's great about this place is that they are made to ORDER.  Perfect wing texture, a ten outta ten.  Sauce- Sauce is really the velvet bow that ties it all together.   ATL has by far the best sauce I have had in my long life of different wing sauces.  CAJUN BBQ my god, I'm a wing fiend because of this place.... do they have a 12 step for foodies?   Go here. NOW."}
{"text":"Yikes...okay so they definitely have the best wings in town,  hands down,  but I think they are aware of that and so they're not big on customer service. The lady who runs the cash register must be the owner who is drowning in money because she absolutely doesn't care about losing a customer.  I think this also explains the store hours...she doesn't need our money,  she has enough.  I still don't think this should grant her entitlement to be rude though.  It's like a hot girl that's a bitch cause she knows the guys like her.  I can't agree with it."}
{"text":"Just had to write an update. This is still my favorite place in the whole valley for wings. I have tried most of the flavors now and my favorite is definitely the seasoned, I get them every time."}
{"text":"Excellent Wings, Friendly Staff, what else can you ask for!? Keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT WINGS! This place is on point for wings. Not sure when everyone else came who left reviews of long wait times but I had no long lines or extensive wait Tuesday at 815pm.  They were cooked perfectly without me asking for \"xtra crispy\", they were crispy with the sauce on, the person who took my order was friendly and smiled (where do u get that today),I was able to get all flats at no xtra charge and the music brought back memories.  There was a Kool Aid dispenser which had the sugar sweet \"red Kool aid\" from back in the day and blue raspberry.  The location was clean and if I lived in Arizona I would be back on a regular. Great job to you all, I was impressed with the customer service, sauce flavors, quick service and of course THE KOOL AID."}
{"text":"Gooooood! Their ATL style wings are good. This place has mixed reviews but I think it's just because every location is different. The location in Chandler is my main go to and they are sometimes hit and miss. One time I could taste a galore of thyme. It was to the point where I couldn't eat it. But otherwise every other time is has been great. They should keep opening more locations."}
{"text":"SO I tried this place for the first time today after reading all the great reviews about it. We walked in and the girls up front greeted us. I told them it was our first time there and asked them if we could sample some of the sauces and they said yes. The owner brought us a sample of their bone in ATL style wings and OMG those were seriously the best wings i have ever eaten ever. The flavor was imaculant. I also tried the cajun barbeque and they were amazing as well just enought spice. Cici was so nice she made sure we liked everything and i couldn't stop ranting to her about how amazing their wings were. I will definately be going back and will never get my wings from anywhere else ever again. Can't wait for more locations to open up. Oh you also have to try their buscuits yummy."}
{"text":"Not impressed. After my stepson raved about how good the wings were, he insisted on going back for some dinner. I had the Garlic Parmesan wings. Um, uh, err...they were ok. The fries were good and the donuts, if that's what you call them, was just ok. The wings were not crunchy on the outside, but cooked. The sauce was just ok.   So, to give OUR community another chance, to redeem themselves we went back earlier this week and again and my opinion is the same...just ok. The cashier was cordial and accommodating, but NOT as friendly as the establishment appears to portray. She also seemed hurried when taking our order. I almost cancelled my order because she made me feel like I was bothering her when trying to decide on what flavors I wanted.   On the bright side, the place was clean, inviting, and welcoming and bright. I loved the music and instantly starting dancing like no one was watching.lol I'm a great dancer!  I would actually give them one more try, but go at the beginning of lunch and ask for the wings to be fried hard and maybe then the skin will have some crunch. I give them A for effort."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. The best wings we have ever had, hands down. We tried 6 of the honey habanero, 6 of the lemon pepper and 6 of the atl. The honey habanero wings were really good. Not too hot. I may try the extreme honey habanero next time. The lemon pepper are not only the best wing we've ever had... but maybe one of the best foods in general I have ever tasted. Unbelievably delicious. As were the ATL. So freaking good. The \"biscuits\" taste like more of a homemade donut. But I aint mad at em! You must try! With honey, cinnamon & powdered sugar. My mouth is watering!Can't wait for our next visit. Thanks, ATL for a wonderful wing experience. See you soon!"}
{"text":"All the way from San Antonio, TX and I must say I had a great experience. The ATL wings were awesome. I wish they had one in Texas I would eat here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Bomb!! Definitely will be back! We tried the honey habanero & ATL traditional wings as well as the honey BBQ boneless for the boys and everyone was happy!! Also try he biscuits with powder sugar and cinnamon with syrup...definitely a cheat day but well worth it!"}
{"text":"The wings were excellent, my husband and I went in at 7ish on a Saturday night and although there was a line, it moved quickly. Most people were getting their food to go so there was seating. They also let me try a sauce before committing to it. We will definitely be back and will recommend to others. Well done, ATL!"}
{"text":"Used to go once a week if not more. The wings are still great, but are way overpriced and the customer service is consistently subpar. Every thing about this place is bad besides the food."}
{"text":"My husband said to me \" let's try this chicken place I saw on YELP\". Hell yeah let's go!!!  It's allllll chicken... 15 different sauces, you can also mix and match sauces. I was so excited I couldn't stand still. This place is a hole in the wall in a strip mall area...    The signs says ATL wings... No glitz or glamour.. Just a simple sign that means All The Luv.....  The chicken was so moist and delicious. Now I know chicken.... It's been a staple in my life for as long as I remember! The sauce was amazing Parmesan garlic.... I wanted to slap someone it was so good....   Then we had the nerve  to order biscuits... Now these are not ordinary biscuits. It's has honey, cinnamon and powder sugar!!!! Where have you been all my life. There were nice and hot then you dip them in the honey.   Let's just say I can go there just for the biscuits too!! This place is an absolute gem... If you have been to LoLo chicken and waffle. This place give them a run for there money!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere leaves much to be desired, but be patient because the wings are worth it! The sauces were great, not too hot but enough to give a good kick. Everything is made fresh so it takes some time, don't expect to be in a hurry at ATL. The wings are meaty and the sides are great! It is worth the trip to Chandler."}
{"text":"My friend Monica O just got ROTD for the original Chandler location. The name sounded familiar and sure enough I had been driving past the new Glendale location on a regular basis. Not a huge wing fan but I like them on occasion. I looked on line and saw they had a salad on their menu. Who can say no to a green salad with tasty chicken chunks? The flavor I chose, with a little help from behind the counter, was citrus chipotle. Excellent choice, a little sweet, a little spicy. The staff was upbeat and joking with the customers. It was lunch time and a line to the door and they didn't skip a beat. Plenty of parking. The restaurant was clean. Even though it is highly visible, several restaurants have failed here. I hope this one sticks."}
{"text":"They have the best wings, but the service is crappy. You cannot call in a order, because they put you on hold so long you arrive there before they come back to the phone. When I arrived I watched employees place customers on hold, then just joke around. I'm still waiting on hold while I am waiting for the wings I just ordered."}
{"text":"OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity!  I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go!    The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!!   Luv me some wings from ATL!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you. I have been a huge fan of ATL Wings ever since I found them in Chandler a few years ago. Had some friends coming into town who used to go to the Chandler location with me and they had been craving wings and asked if I could pick up some for Super Bowl Sunday, I said heck yea, but since I wasn't going to be close to Chandler, let's try the Phoenix location, so that's what we did!   What was ordered\" 12 piece Garlic Parmesan, 12 piece Cajun BBQ and 12 piece Honey Habanero   Each wing was cooked to perfection and coated perfectly, these are some great wings, my favorite still is the honey habanero though Oh wee! So good!  If you haven't tried ATL, you need too! Go! Now! Get some wings!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!!  The owner is so nice!   Food is amazing!!!  Make sure to get the biscuits   And koolaid on tap...what else could u ask for"}
{"text":"Before I tried this spot, it was recommended to me on the same day by two different people..it has to be the best wing spot in the Chandler/PHX area. Bizzomb.com. The sauces are to die for, unbelievable flavor, the cakes are tasty, even the fries are awesome, and if you add cheese to them, you are really cookin now. They even have that old school Kool Aid fountain with 3 different flavors flowing. (I always get the blue one...)   The employees there always take care of me, very pleasant and conversational, I always look forward to a visit there."}
{"text":"Wings are fantastic, i ordered the honey habanero and wow they were the best i have ever had."}
{"text":"I give ATL Wings 4 out of 5 stars only because I called 5 times in one day to be put on hold each time. I hung up after being on hold for over 5 min each time I called. My boyfriend had to just go there and order. There garlic Parmesan chicken and ranch chicken is out of this world, but I like the teriyaki also. I have had the honey Barbecue also and that's pretty good. The biscuits are so so so good. I don't care for the fries because they are rather plain. All in all this place is great and a must try if your near by."}
{"text":"Love love their wings they have the best wings in chandler well in az since I've been on the hunt for great wings, the service is amazing and they always ensure you are happy with their food, I've gone there back to back several times I never do that but they are that good!"}
{"text":"It's just as good as everyone else says...would make any red blooded American slap their own mama good. You can't go wrong with any of the sauces or rubs! Prices are decent and the staff inside were all so nice and welcoming. Will be back!"}
{"text":"OH MY GAWD-  is what comes out of my wings stuffed mouth EVERY TIME I eat the honey habanero wings.  Even though I have only been twice(doesn't seem like enough right?!), Each time I eat these messy little wings of delight(And YES i lick my finger after each wing is devoured),  the experience of the flavor and meat to bone ratio is beyond satisfying.  Last time I tried the mild wings (since My boyfriend cant handle hot wings) they had some good spice but myself personally could go way hotter than that. So I still have yet to try more flavors because I am always so tempted to just get the honey habanero but want to try more flavors at the same time.  The second trip convincing my boyfriend to come with made my wait time for this delicious masterpiece less boring also because we talked to the owner the whole time which I always always ALWAYS love because I believe that owners that have great relationships with their customers make a successful business(+1); like I have said time and time again! When owners lose that bond with customers you lose out on more customer flow In my opinion.  The place has TVs to watch ESPN while you wait(+1) , Two different refrigerators(Coca cola and Pepsi) with the correct products in both(+1)(My stepdad has worked for coca cola my whole life practically so I notice everything that has to do with soda) Kool aid and Sweet Tea(haven't tried yet either shockingly)(+1) and Desserts, specials and Catfish(On steroids says my BF because they are such big pieces) !  On my second trip I ordered 10 honey habanero and 5 sweet and tangy but whatever they put under the honey habanero i am not positive if they were really the sweet and tangy because I didn't taste sweet or tangy, just salt.  I love salty stuff but it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting or loved nearly as much as the honey habanero.  But everyone has different taste obviously.  It doesn't affect my thoughts on how much I Love this place and they got my business and boyfriends and friends business forever and will promote new places such as this every chance I get!!!!  It would be awesome if they could open up a bigger spot like BWW with a bar so they can play the fights I would much rather go there than BWW any day just because the staff is beyond nice compared to any wing spot I have been too and Lolo's in Phoenix and Scottsdale combined.   Update:05/08/2012: A word of caution, if you received a text from atl wings about .50 cent wing tuesdays from 4-9pm make sure you ask about it unlike myself who paid full price not really realizing until i had left and didn't feel like going back asking so late.    The honey biscuits remind me of dense crispy gooey donuts i would have to share them with others because eating all those to myself plus 6 wings i feel like im in a severe food acoma now. delicious and dense."}
{"text":"Great wings and Super service!  When you are in the mood for wings, try this place and you will comeback.  It's like merging the best of southern fry chicken (from the south) and the flavor fairy.  And don't forget to order some honey buns for desert."}
{"text":"This place is legit. The girl working the register was very helpful since we hadn't been there before. She let us sample two flavors. She recommended the dessert biscuits. The wings were large and full of flavor!!! The fries we so good! The single order is huge! And the dessert biscuits were delicious. As we were enjoying our meal the cashier was nice enough to ask how our meal was and made sure we didn't need anything! It was so nice. The place was busy and now we can see why. Can't wait to go back. Only reason I left out one star was the loud rap music coming from the kitchen, but it won't be a deterrent for us!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings so far in AZ. The Spicy ATL dry rub is down right mouthwatering. If you're into juicy and crispy wings this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Wings are on point. No longer need long wongs overcooked wings gonna be coming back often. to bad I found this place after football season.,ATL dry rub wings I recommend"}
{"text":"Honestly I loved this place but I don't like the old woman that takes the orders. the lady placed me on hold for 35 min I drove from my work which is 30 min away and let me remind you i'm still on hold. why have phone orders if your not going to take them also make sure to ask for your chicken wings fresh because they like to make like 50 at a time then let them sit by the fryer then when a order is place they dunk them for like 15 sec and serve you 45 min old wings this place was 5 stars in till I ate here and noticed how they treated there meat I honestly threw up all night just beware guys please"}
{"text":"The wings are pretty great, but pretty pricey - luckily on Tuesdays they have $0.69 cent wings all day.   The fries are gross. Not crispy & fresh. Just greasy potatoes they've left out for a while.   The cooks are pretty friendly, the cashiers are pretty friendly too - but the older black lady not sure what her name is always messes up my order . Literally every single time. And they have a bad habit of not answering phone calls on Sunday's for some reason ....overall good place ! I def go back like every other week haha.  Ask for the punch card!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The ATL style fries were my favorite. The staff was great and they keep it super clean! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Favorite wing shop! Has kol-aid, wings melt in your mouth, skinny seasoned fries, and many different flavors."}
{"text":"I love love love hot wings! I had high expectations for this place as my boyfriend raved about it for days after visiting town for work. Walking in... the location inside was nice. The tables, however, looked like the hadn't been wiped down. The tables were full of crumbs and upon seating ourselves, no one came to wipe it down. So why the 5 stars?.... because the food took my breath away!  Seriously, I still think about these wings. They were cooked perfectly. The outside crispy and the inside perfectly moist. They had a great deal of flavor options, some being quite unique.  The French fries were okay, definitely not as magical as the wings.  Get the biscuits! They're smothered with honey and powdered sugar and are sure to be a nice ending to your meal.  The look aid dispensers were cool, though I can't comment on the flavor as I stuck with water. Give ATL wings a go, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Straight up legit wings joint.  All they do is wings and they are amazing! They aren't a chain and have 18 amazing flavors. Be sure to ask for the chef special.  Also get the homemade biscuits.  You won't be disappointed.  They even let you try the wing sauce before ordering."}
{"text":"Possibly the best wings I've ever had. The extra ranch is a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"This place is good. But not waiting 40 minutes for 6 piece wings good Also.  I've been before where I order 12 Wings.  I ask for 6 one style and 6 another and get charged for splitting the order? But on the menu you can buy in 6, so I don't understand why I get charged......."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best wings I have ever had. My favorite sauce is the Honey Habanero.  My wife and I ended up going when there was a special (60 cent wings), delicious and cheap :).  If you want to try out multiple flavors they do have a rule that a flavor can be applied to every 3 wings which is pretty good and allows you to try a lot of flavors quickly.  Overall the wings were crispy, and delicious and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place that serves amazing wings with some style. This placed does that for me. From the koolaid fountain to the cutout metal chicken on the wall, this place is the shit. Their wings are definitely the best wings I have ever had in AZ. Other places are super greasy, and make me poop right after. But this place has defied the odds with my bowel issue and love of wings.  I will definitely be back and become a loyal customer. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Great fast and amazing service. The chicken wings are out of this world and don't get me started on the fries wow. I had the toxic level ones they were the perfect heat I was looking for and I'm a fan of the heat. Also the dry rub atl spicy amazing."}
{"text":"First time here. My husband got garlic Parmesan and lemon pepper, he said they were the best of each flavor he's ever had. I got the spicy atl and traditional hot. The spice of the spicy atl was ON POINT. Nose runnin, lips swollen goodness, sensational taste as well! The traditional hot was delicious, really flavorful! The fries were light and crispy, absolutely amazing. We will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I'm huge fan of this place. Its tough for me and my wife to Love this place due to the Gilty feeling of bad eating we get after visiting this establishment. The food is Outstanding and I've liked everything except the Catfish fried. My wife enjoys the catfish, but I think its lacking flavor, however they fry it to a cripy golden brown crust. I could just eat the crust and forget the fish.   We've been twice now and I'm sad to say that we pretty much ordered the same things twice. The garlic parmesan wings and honey habenero wings are our favorites (of course we haven't tried any others, so take it with a grain of salt) catfish, corn nuggets, fried okra, french fries, and coleslaw. And to finish it all off...the best Biscuits of all time, if you consider a biscuit a French dougnut.(beignet) a biscuit. Seriously the best thing ever, but you feel pretty guilty afterwards.   My recommendation is to hit the gym prior to going so you don't feel so guilty!   But what ever you do, GO......"}
{"text":"So I was going to head over to Buffalo Wild Wings yesterday with my wife and daughter, then I remember hearing about ATL Wings from a from, and thought I would give it a shot.   Let's just say I won't be going to the other place anymore.   Not only were the wings the best I've had, I came back the next day to get my coworkers ( and myself) some for lunch, and the owner remembered my name and what I had the day before when I asked for sauce suggestions.   Anyway, best wings, great people!"}
{"text":"Nice place, very clean, food was delicious, I'm definitely come nag back soon, I really love this place"}
{"text":"Very very good wings! Huge, meaty wings with crispy skin and just the right about of sauce. Biggest complaint is that online menu does not match real menu. Prices are different. Also they now only sell wings and fries. None of the other sides mentioned online or the fried fish or sandwich options. Also, ordered the atl style fries which were really just fries. Didn't taste any hint of extra spices in them.   Tried three flavors of wings: -honey habenero - sweet but spicy. This was a thick and sticky sauce. It was great to dip the fries in -Cajun hot - a drier sauce. Pretty spicy but still flavorful -cirrus chipotle - maybe my favorite of the three. Also sweet but with just a little kick. Probably could have been just a tad spicier.   Place does a great business. Plan to wait for your wings but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We came here to try the wings.  Good stuff we had the garlic pepper, spicy atl, honey bbq .... yum . Get the atl fries. The manager comes  around makes sure the taken  care of. Keeps the restaurant clean. Definitely  will come back and try other flavors"}
{"text":"Located on warner, west of country club. I got lost in the shopping center looking for it.  I am not sure if it was because I was so hungry or not, but these wings were the best I have ever had! I did 10pc so I could have two flavors; BBQ honey and mild.  So. Amazing.  Really spicy though. They let me sample the sauces before I bought them.  Also, they have koolaid on tap! Epic!   I would have give 5 stars but there were some issues.. our fries came out 25 mins after the rest of our order, and it was super busy, so it took a long time to get our food. I recommend calling ahead and ordering during busy times.  Lastly, I noticed one of the employees eating off the prep line. That's kinda gross.  I should knock it down to 3 stars but they were so damn delicious!  Oh, one more thing: the whole place is lit with only red lights, so food looks really different. I am not sure how I feel about that. I used my flashlight on my phone to inspect things."}
{"text":"Sauces on fleek! Even the ranch dipping sauce was tasty. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the wings were a tad bit on the dry side. Other than that fact, the Honey Habanero and Cajun BBQ sauces were pure deliciousness. We also ordered a side of their French Fries and oh boy were those home-tasty good! All the good food was washed down by some Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid. Yup, I said Kool-Aid! They also had Grape and Tropical punch flavors.   We came (party of two) around the time they opened, so the service was fast. The owner also greeted us and was quite friendly. Whenever we do decide to come back, I'll be sure to try the apparently hottest Toxic sauce!"}
{"text":"Great sauces. Good service. Horrible value.  I just paid $8 for 7 boneless wings. These things were TINY. They were the size of nuggets from Wendy's. Actually, they were nuggets. Not whole chunks of chicken. Just ground, low quality, pre-made, pressed and formed typical nuggets.  Such a let down.  For what it's worth, service was fast and the honey BBQ sauce was really good."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome wing. Great customer service. Food was quick and quality. Use to go to wing stop across the street but ATL all day now!"}
{"text":"Had 10 of the honey habanero wings along with the spicy ATL fries.  The wings were excellent - among the best I've ever had anywhere.  They were liberally sauced and very meaty.  I've always liked Native New Yorker's wings, but they are so tiny and thin, you feel like you're being ripped off.  ATL Wings are both better in taste and size.  The spicy fries were excellent as well. Prices are reasonable. I took my order to go, but everything inside looked clean.  The service was quick (about 10 minutes from placing my order to receiving it) and everyone was very friendly.  This is a good find for me. I will likely be back at least once a week now that I've found this place."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty wings! Very tasty sauces and rubs. The ATL rub is amazing. The honey BBQ was very good too. The garlic parmesean was a little disappointing not very cheesy. The main reason I only give 3 stars is because the wings are not consistent in size and some are quite small... but all in all I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. I would say this is my favorite wing place in Phoenix. The chicken is really good & the flavors are powerful.  I usually get the garlic parmesan & dip the wings in their hot sauce & it is A1. A great mix of flavors! The seasoned (ATL style) are sooooo yummy! They also are extremely flavorful.  The kool aid puts everything together as it's not tooo sugary & not too watery - it's just right & is always a great choice with the meal!"}
{"text":"WAAAAAAANGS!!!!  There are some certain foods that are hard to mess up especially when it comes to specializing in chicken wings ... however, some still do! I am very picky with my chicken wings so don't take this review lightly.  I love my chicken wings with the perfect crunch, juiciness, & sauce ratio. Sauce needs to be finger lickin' good! I prefer the paddles too. If you're just like me, you're gonna love ATL WINGS!   ATL Wings DID NOT disappoint!!! They live up to the stars they have! There were only a couple of people when we walked in around 7 pm on a Thursday night which was odd because schools out and we were expecting it to be packed. We were lucky to walk in at such a perfect time when they weren't as busy.   Customer Service: Super friendly!! She took her time to explain to us the sauces they offer and even asked if we wanted to sample their ATL style wings. I guess she sensed that I wasn't sure about my decision. I was surprised they give you a whole wing to sample! I don't think I've ever had that at any wing place... like EVER! So after she brought us the wing, we decided to stick to ATL STYLE SAUCE AND HONEY MUSTARD. We also got some fries for our little one. If you order a meal, you get a free drink or a drink comes with it.   The food came within 5 minutes or so! Unfortunately, they messed up our order but they made up for it by giving us extra wings. They told us ahead of time that they messed it up but it wasn't a big deal to us at all. We also realized that they gave us the wrong sauce but the honey BBQ was also so good that we didn't even bother changing it especially when they already went above and beyond by giving us some extra wings. No complaints here!   Once we got our food, we didn't realize that the place also got packed. There was already a long line forming within minutes of us waiting for our order.   Drink: They had coke products and even had KOOL AID! What!!!! They had the blue, red, and purple kool Aide! Unfortunately I didn't get it for myself since it's way above what my Keto diet would allow but my husband said it was really good and it killed me that I wasn't able to try it!   If you can't finish your meal, there are some containers sitting at the front near the sauce and utensils. Bathroom is located in the back and extra napkins are by the walls near the drink.   Overall! We will definitely go back again for sure! I almost forgot to take pictures because I was so eager to just dig in hahaha   IT IS ALL ABOUT THE SAUCE! I need to go back and try em all!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a restaurant that deserves five stars, but we've found it. Crisp and crunchy chicken wings and fries in a variety of flavors await in the little restaurant. I've tried the other places in the valley and they just don't compare to the generous sized wings and flavorful rubs and sauces that you find here. Don't forget the Koolaid and a sweet donut for dessert."}
{"text":"Go on and get you some!!  Their dry rubs are phenomenal and up there with some of the best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good lord they make some good wings!! I ordered 18 of the Traditional Style Chef's Special Wings and they did not disappoint. Music is fun too, a mix of old school r&b and hip hop. Great atmosphere and great service. The woman working the register couldn't have been sweeter. If you are looking for some delicious wings look no further!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! If you are stuck across the street at the bowling alley it's only a five minute walk and well worth it! We ordered the atl dry rub and that was the clear winner of all the flavors! The medium is pretty spicy so if you aren't a fan of spice for the mild or the honey bbq which were both fantastic! Make sure you order the fries, they were my favorite part of my meal. Overall a fantastic wing place, highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't even know where to begin...this is my happy place! I am from the south and this place is as legit as it gets when it comes to the wings! It's our usual go-to on Tuesday after work for .50 cent wings! It's so hard to stray away from honey habanero and the seasoned wings - just amazing and the texture is perfection. They also recently revamped their menu. It's been simplified and some of the items are less expensive. My only point of criticism is their catfish, but with that said, I am from Mississippi and no one here makes catfish correctly. Cornmeal, salt and pepper. That's it. No seasoning salt, flour, egg wash or any other business. Keep it simple and true to form if you claim that it's \"Southern Style,\" Overall, this is one of my favorite places in the valley!"}
{"text":"Oh man..  Oh man...  OH MAN!  Insert Homer J. Simpson drooling .gif here pls.  I was with my sis whilst we fought against the pre-Christmas Rush War that was happening within the Chandler Fashion Mall parking lot, as we finally managed to exit the lot, our tummies rumbled loudly. We needed substance, substance that was deep fried, walked on two legs, and had two wings! Thank you Yelp App for showing what's around us, or else we'd be stuck at another fast food burger joint that we did not have a desire for.  So as we made our trip over, and getting slightly lost because GPS decided that the restaurant was right where a newly built school was, we found this small place, parked, and lumbered into ATL Wings!  As we walked up to the counter, staring at the menu above, the cashier said hello to us and asked if we've been there before. We admitted it was our first time there, and she gave us a sample of the Honey Habanero sauce - sweet with a kick - and I knew what I was going to get!  We ordered our wings, sis added the Cheese Fries, and we waited. We were pretty excited, this place had a ton of reviews, all around the 4 star mark! Our wait came to an end as the lady came out from the kitchen, wings piping hot, and fries sitting right next to them, drenched in a glorious thick yellow goo we've all known to love when melted, CHEESE!  Wasting no time, we sank our teeth into these glorious wings, we looked at each other and knew, this place was a keeper!! The wings have a great amount of meat on them, and are fried perfectly. They're tossed with just the right amount of sauce, nothing dripped and there was no pool of sauce left behind as we polished them off one by one. The Cheesy Fries we crunchy, yet still soft in the middle, they leave the skins on when frying them up, and they were just perfect! It reminded me of the fries you get at the State Fair, beautiful.  To end our wing feast, my sis ordered the Honey Biscuits, which are more like light puffy donuts (Beignets), drenched in honey, powdered with sugar, lightly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on in the inside. Argh! I'm drooling at the thought of them as I'm typing this review! The only thing missing was some jam on those bad boys, I wanted to order another round, but our bellies were already packed full of wings and cheese fries!  Next time we're over in the area, we're definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Cheaper than wing-stop but tastes like wingstop but kinda better than wing stop... the blue cheese sucks but the wings don't. The wings are so juicy and plump and pretty big! The koolaid is delicious too! The counter people are dope. They accept card! They have ample seating and they have a bathroom. The place is clean! They have two tv's one with sports one with other stuff playing. My only concern is the blue cheese... I want better blue cheese. Better blue cheese so that I can dip my delicious wings in it."}
{"text":"Red kool-aid and those spicy honey wings!!! Skip the fries they are soggy and even with the cheese they kinda suck.. unless you're into that type of thing... I came here for the wings. They really are the best. I'll honestly never have wing stop because this is my new favorite place! The service wasn't too shabby either. The employees were friendly and helpful. They even brought out food out to us. They do accept cash and credit. They have lots of seating indoors and outside."}
{"text":"ATL wings have ruined all other wing places for me. We have tried almost every flavor they have. The classic ATL rub is where it's at."}
{"text":"First timer today and all I can say is wow!! Their wings are amazing full of sauce and not like other places where there is barely any sauce ! Service is good as well the employees are nice, patient and helpful. Pretty cool they have free refills on drinks including koolaid !"}
{"text":"As an avid wing fan I can say ATL is the best in the Valley!  They are always consistently cooked, sauces and most important delicious!  Friendly staff as well.  I'm waiting for them to open a Sports Bar!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Friday night to get take out. I had already perused the reviews on Yelp and new the flavored wings I wanted. I felt welcomed from the minute I walked in the door and service was great. I ordered 6 wings and they were nice enough to let me try two sauces. I got 3 garlic Parmesan wings and 3 ATL rub wings. I then ordered a small fry ATL style. The food was so delicious. The wings were crispy and I absolutely loved both sauces (I'm so glad Yelpers steered me in the right direction). The fries with the ATL dry rub seasoning were tasty & def had a zing of spicyness. All and all- being from the East coast, these wings hit the spot. I felt like I was back in Philly. Will be back... a lot... ASAP"}
{"text":"Wanted BWW but I was no way near where I was at. I Yelp the nearest wings place. ATL wings popped up. Decided to give it a try. I was impress! Cashier was kind,even offered a free sample. Wings were good and spicy. Great place for authentic wings!"}
{"text":"Love this fucking place hands down the best wing I have ever had in my life and I eat a lot of wings lol. The staff is alway nice, the place can get busy at time but don't let that stop you from getting these awesome ass wings this place no matter how packed is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Brought in my whole family today to experience the most amazing wings that I had discovered a while ago. The wings were delicious as always along with the exceptional customer service, making this one happy family night out!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass wings!!! I went on a recommendation from my friend Ashley and I don't regret it!!! Way better than Wingstop!!! No joke!!! ATL style fries r the best!!! Kool-Aid on tap?! R u kidding me?! Best wings spot ever!!! Check em out peoples..."}
{"text":"Why do people eat chicken wings? Is it the meat? The sauce? The service of the restaurant? I found all three of those things at ATL. Walking into this restaurant you can tell they have their own style of doing things. The service reminded me of New York, kind but hard working. The wings were of good quality, and the sauce wasn't what I expected. Some of the reviews I read said their wings are dry, maybe they shouldn't order dry rub wings?"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken wings to go and it took forever. We had been the first in line when we entered and it took over 25 minutes for our food. So, obviously super Slow service. They charge you if you want more than one container of sauce. Really sad and pathetic celery with my wings. The wings tasted decent. I don't know what the big rave about this place was though."}
{"text":"Customer service very rude. How do you expect to do busines when another server is interputing me.  I say\" Im sorry am I bothering you\" then look at me and say \" Oh I was going to say something\" like I was the bad person. Never will I return and tell all my friends, not too."}
{"text":"Delicious wings.   We will be back.    Service was very nice and friendly.     Would be 5 stars except the scent of pinesol was overwhelming. I am glad it was a clean establishment but food and pinesol do not mix."}
{"text":"The wings here are in a class of their own! Amazing! The aumbiance is horrible, but get them to go, and you're good! Worth the drive from wherever you live!"}
{"text":"We have searched far and wide to find a good wing place and we finally found it!!!! This place has the best wings ever! We love the ATL and the SPICY ATL. Once you try this place you will be addicted. Great owners and employees too. They made my husband myself and our 7 kids feel like family."}
{"text":"ATL Wings is our new go-to place for wings.  They are way better than Long Wong's and they accept credit/debit cards.  We used to order wings every week from Pizza Hut  but recent changes to their pricing forced us to look elsewhere.  We tried Long Wong's and those were good but ATL's wings are GREAT.   ATL has a bunch of flavors to choose from.  Of course there is traditional hot which is what Cristina orders nearly every time. I like BBQ variations and ATL has three... Honey BBQ, Hot BBQ and Cajun BBQ.     The Cajun BBQ is a PERFECT blend of spicy with just a taste of sweet.  My first order I had half/half Honey and Cajun and while the honey BBQ was good I was wishing I had ordered all Cajun.  So good I couldn't stop eating until I ran out..   ATL also has other menu items that I did not pay much attention to but if those other items are as good as their wings, we will be eating here often.  The only other thing we tried were the fries which were good too."}
{"text":"We drove up from Tucson to try this place because our kids are big wing lovers. This place has great reviews so we picked it. They sure live up to the reputation! The friendliest service ever and the best wings ever. They gave us sample ones to try out as well as free biscuits which are to die for. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not only are the wings THE BOMB!!!! But they have kook aid on tap and the staff is so amazing. They let us sample wings and Little J delivered the wings to us next door. If you haven't been to this place you are missing out for real. ATL for life!!"}
{"text":"I moved into my new place just off of Thomas and quickly discovered that there is an ATL wings right across the street! I was happy, but wary because it can be kind of hit or miss when trying a new location. This is definitely a HIT! Went on a Tuesday around 4, and it was steady but not too busy. Staff was friendly and helpful (that honey mustard). The location is spacious and the bathroom was clean. Everything tasted freshly made. I'm happy, to be in the same neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great place best wings ever then any other place puts wing stop and Buffalo Wild Wings out business need open up in California as well but love this place and location the best love all the sister their cool and know me clean place to eat very fast service and very personal and they remember everyone and. They keep  it real"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. I'm a wing fanatic and it's right down the street. I had high expectations due to all the 5 star reviews. For $1/wing, the wings are very very small and the sauce I got was lacking flavor. The fries however were delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a good little find. The Honey habanero wings are awesome and the honey biscuts are a must have. The wings are big and crisp on the outside. Sauces are not very hot but have good flavor.  The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed I went in there and asked for Honey Mustard wings, my friend asked for Sweet & Tangy and we both ended up eating each others wings because they mixed up the orders. Smh I didn't even ask for teriyaki. The Cajun fries are okay but not all that great, was really expecting better service which initially ruined my experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I used to go to the one on 51st street but since we live near old town we were thrilled to see this just opened around the corner from us. They were so friendly and fast (a breath of fresh air compared to previous experiences at other location) when we placed our order the lady who took our order asked how long until WE would be ready, I thought that was awesome!! Once we got inside, the customer service was matched with personal greetings and smiles. And the food was soo good as expected. We will be frequent customers!"}
{"text":"Shout out to ATL Wings for having the best wings in PHX!    Regardless of whatever flavor you get make sure you try the ATL Style.  These had to be some of the best wings I have ever had.  The fries are solid with some of their dipping sauces too.  Last but not least the honey biscuits are dangerous but so damn good.   I haven't Kool-Aid in years.  Talk about bring back some memories!   Over all it is a solid spot and you can't go wrong with it.   The owner Mike is a real cool and humble guy.  You can't go wrong supporting a business with owners like that.    I will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Tasty and meaty, my preferred place to get yummy wings! No other place compares after eat these wings!"}
{"text":"The best wings. ATL style and Lemon pepper are the besttttt. The service is always great and when they can they hook it up. Never charge extra for special orders and willing to accommodate for anyone who is picky. I always go out of my way to get ATL wings if we are going to go out for wings."}
{"text":"Best damn wings in the state although they taste so good I am pretty sure their dry rubs are chock full of MSG. All the signs are there addicting-delicious-feel like crap once your done. Nevertheless I will gladly eat there but just sparingly. My favorite is the ATL STyle wings and fries. Really nice people in there as well."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Not only was the staff super friendly but the wings were amazing! I highly recommend the ATL and lemon pepper dry rub!"}
{"text":"Warning very addicting ! Best wings ever!  Honey habernaro and atl style are sooooooo good. I come at least weekly"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place. Family owned. Super gracious for your business. Consistently perfect wings. This is their newest location. I walked in a few weeks ago never having tried ATL wings. Let me tell you, these are thee best wings I've ever had. So crispy. Yet so juicy. Lot of meat on them too. If you're like me and like sweet heat, try the mango habanero. To die for. Also, the buns are a must if it's your first time. And every time after that for that matter..  Every time I go in it looks slow, but I know it's because this is a new location and there isn't good signage. The product speaks for itself though. I genuinely hope this place succeeds. It's difficult being a small family owned operation."}
{"text":"The wings were great from lemon pepper, bbq, and ATL style. The service was excellent and fast. If you like wings great place to stop"}
{"text":"Love this place! They are always friendly and the wings are good! Kool aid is good too!"}
{"text":"The wings are great but the service sucks ! I swear the workers have no type of manners .. I called to place a order and told her we will pay cash . Once my husband got there she said she didn't have my order until we paid ?? Jajaja really how unprofessional. The ghetto white girl is always cursing up a storm in there . I'm sorry but Atlanta has some well mannered people , theses people have no type of education,respect , or common sense . Fire them all they make your company look horrible.. Also reporting them with the BBB HOPEFULLY THERES SOME CHANGES !"}
{"text":"I decided to come back and revise this. I love the wings. Love the girls that work there. They know me by name. Top it off they have a guilty pleasure Red Kool Aid.   Season wings are my favorite. It's a popular place.  So call ahead and they'll have your order ready when you arrive."}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant!! Best wings we have every had, and we search for good wings!! The people who work here are super nice and the service is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for the first time and the staff was wonderful. I was blown away by the \"Kool-Aid\" fountain! They were fast and professional and when I got home the wings were hot juicy and properly seasoned!! I love this place and my kids have asked that I stop by again today to grab 50 more wings!!!!"}
{"text":"I downloaded yelp just to say that this is one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant. the person who took my order was really nice and helpful and really nice to my child! offered samples to us. the food was great, some of the best wings I've ever had!. will always come back! thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I have been to ATL wings 4 times so far, and each time I feel that the cooks are very consistent with their recipe. I've had both their bone-in and boneless wings.   I am a fan of the bone-in ATL rub wings. Made crispy yet juicy, just the way i like them. I can not say the same for the boneless, to me they feel like chicken nuggets dipped in sauce, ad that is why I do not give it 5 stars :(   Their ATL season fries are pretty delish! especially while you dip in the hot sauce or the ranch, or in both!   The front lady is such a sweetheart, she's always so busy but manages to take care of the people ordering and also i seen her go in the back and help out the cooks.   Bottom line is ... You bet I recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great wings that are cooked the right way! A little crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Customer Service was exceptional as well. We were greeted with smiles and friendly conversation as soon as we walked in. I highly recommend you give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"This place has great wings unfortunately they don't care about business. They don't answer the phone. I have been trying to call them for two days now and it just rings. I called the other location and they say \"oh maybe they're too busy\" we showed up and the place is LITERALLY empty. I think it's a fluke so I try to call again today because, again the wings are great and no one answers. I've called several times."}
{"text":"WARNING!! Please read before you go here: So I loved atl until today I went in and was gonna redeem my 10 free wing reward I ordered a 18 piece, the rude nasty girl at the counter said well can I give you the 10 free and charge you you for a 6. I said why am I losing 2 wings she said ignorantly, cause we dont have an 8 piece so I dont know what to charge. All she had to do was ring up the 18 and remove the cost of a 10 piece and charge me the remainder but I guess she didn't go to school. So I ended up buying a 10 piece and got another 10 for free but she rang up my order wrong and gave me a 16 piece so then I had to pay another 3 bucks to correct their mistake and gave me nothing but horrible nasty looks and was staring at my girlfriend as if she was pissing her off. Will never return, used to love this place was loyal, got the loyal reward for 10 free wings and then they ruined it. This place has been falling down hill for a very long time and I cannot wait for them to be closed. It's also sad I can't order an 18 piece and get 10 free since (yall) cant do math, charge me for a 6 and hook up the last 2 to make 18 who would have thought giving away 2 wings could bankrupt a business. I made a yelp account just so I could warn people about this place its the amys baking company of wings you were warned! Staff should be nice not ghetto trash!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is always great. The wings are amazing and I have yet to try a flavor I do not like. I had one issue with a carry out order that was not up to regular ATL Wings standards, but upon returning to the store the Manager ensured we received a new order hot and fresh! Overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"What can I say about ATL wings? These guys are the shit. They know how to do wings right. My only grievance is that every time you order for pickup they'll tell you that the wings will be ready in 10 minutes and every time, and I mean every single time, you'll get there and notify them you're here to pickup your order and then they'll drop the wings. I can't complain cause the wings are always fresh, but it is kind of annoying because you have to wait an extra 15 minutes or so unnecessarily."}
{"text":"ATL Wings are the best! Spicy ATL wings are the best! Highly recommend this restaurant. Venue is clean and staff is friendly! Been multiple times and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean store. Kool-Aid fountains going, that was pretty retro. We ordered numerous types of wings to try them. The wings were big, which is great but ours were pink at the bone. I am not a fan of wings with thick, fatty skin, which these had. They are guy wings. The guys liked them more. The hot wing sauce was really good, perfect even. The dry rub, well that is not a hot wing and we did not care for it. That is for non-pepper heads. We also tried the habanero and I liked that. The garlic Parmesan dry rub was not good for us, Lots of grease in the dish and tasted like garlic bread. Not a hot wing. We won't be back. Better choices out there for true Buffalo wings."}
{"text":"Best wings I ever had.... The biscuits to die for, make sure to get the honey, powdered sugar, and cinnamon on them."}
{"text":"ATL HAS PROBABLY THE BEST WINGS IN TOWN BUT!!!!!,   If management don't do anything to control customer service and their cleanliness inside then I'm afraid they will start loosing customers.  And that's too bad because it's been my favorite wing restaurant since they first started in Gilbert.   So please owners/management do something about this"}
{"text":"Amazing wings!! Great customer service it felt like home I'll definitely be back y'all!"}
{"text":"It's a real shame that the service is terrible, and they exhaust most of their things all the time. The food was good. I would strongly recommend traveling to another place, if possible."}
{"text":"Love it. Can't get enough. Open late, food is ready fast, reasonably priced and heavenly to enjoy."}
{"text":"The best customer service and attention. She even let me try a wing with sauce and it was amazing! People should see them as an example of the difference you make by giving the consumer time to make decisions. Everyone was welcoming!"}
{"text":"Best wings place in AZ hands down. Customer service is always great! The place is always packed and it's not a surprise why. The wings are crunchy and meaty. Fries are bomb and they also have kool-aid. I am hooked, I literally want to come back every chance I get"}
{"text":"This place is amaze zuuuuuuu zingggg! My cousin found them on yelp and suggested we go, not mad at all. It's cool if you want to not get distracted by a million menu items. The minimal things they have are FUEGO! I got half honey bbg and medium hot sauce wings. We shared the cheese fries which was more than enough for 2 people. Give this place a try it will not disappoint. The people that run it are just as cool, love supporting a fam owned business. The woman that helped me was radiating sweetness and just happy to be there. Thanks ATL wings so happy you opened up a location near me"}
{"text":"This place got my wife through both pregnancies ! Talk about taking care of a craving . They hit a home run with us every time ! If you like wings then you have to try this place ! Worth every penny !"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place many times. I finally go in to try it- I said hi to the cashier and she just looked right at me and didn't respond. A greeting goes a long way... I turned right around and walked out. Sorry, not sorry."}
{"text":"The lemon pepper wings.....yes please. They have a ton of different flavors of rubs and sauces. When I was there waiting for my food several people in a row got the honey habonaro. They have biscuits but they are more like donuts"}
{"text":"Closed 25 minutes before 9pm (closing time). Apparently the workers don't want to work. All the chairs were up so no one can eat inside 25 minutes before it closes.  I can't imagine the owner would be happy with this. We drove 19 minutes to get here only to leave empty handed."}
{"text":"Not even close to one star! To go Order took 5 minutes to be served.  Got home ate 2 flaps out of a dozen $14.27 Inedible and dried out.  Took them back to store after work Asked for my money back. They refused and said they would make me some new ones. I said I just want my money back. They said no and that I should leave.  I said I am. Or going to leave without my money. Two cooks came out of kitchen to forcibly remove me from store. I told them they need more guys to do that and that I just wanted my money back.  Mgr called 911. They finally arrive 10 min later Mgr will not return my calls for a refund Do not patronize this rude establishment  Terrible wings and customer service."}
{"text":"Omg- phenomenal wings!!!! Gives Pluckers ( my favorite wing place in austin) a run for their money!!! I loved the dry rub and husband got great spicy wings and daughter yummy ATL wings. All phenomenal! Service excellent too!! Home run here. 10 stars!!"}
{"text":"atl dry rub  food: the dry rub. i love the rub mix. heavy on the sage. if you like that, then you will love this. the wings were crispy. not battered. i prefer the non battered stuff, unless it's slathered in sauce. ***4/5  service: simple service. order and pick up. the place is kind of dark. it seems that most of the light comes from the outside. doesnt matter. it does have a fast food feel to it, but that should be a given. ***3/5  value: wings are always expensive no matter where you go. a dollar a wing is about right at restaurants unless it's happy hour. i say these are worth it when you really want wings. they were decent sized and the flavors were on point. ***3/5"}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had in my life. People that work there are so happy and helpful. I loved it"}
{"text":"Yep, after reading the reviews we had to try them out. So, we hopped on a plane and flew out from California to get some wings. Glad we did! The wings are lightly crispy and then covered in sauce, and there are so many sauces to choose from! The medium is just right with just enough spice that it lets you enjoy a bunch of wings without frying your taste buds. Same with the ATL rub, great taste and just the right amount of heat. Forget the wing chain restaurants, these guys have them beat by far! These are the best wings, bar none!  And the staff, they are great, friendly people! They brought us sauce samples to help us decide and even a couple of wings with rub to try too. They came by the table and chatted up with us and joined in the fun. We had a great time and we will most definitely be back next time we are in town, which is pretty frequent it seems!  Oh, and ya gotta have the biscuits, they are like beignets but different. Just be careful as they can be addicting!"}
{"text":"Got to eat at this place for the first time with a large group of people. I was expecting things to not be as good because we had like 15-20 people on one ticket so I thought that would throw them off. While we were ordering everyone asked the same questions. I felt so bad but the cashier was patient and kind the whole time. Our giant party was no issue at all for them! They even over delivered. I ordered honey habanero traditional wings and fries. Since we had the large group I got to try someone's atl, they were so good! The fries were something special! Great great restaurant and could not over recommend! The team even brought out a sweet dessert on the house after our meal. Loved loved loved everything about this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  A little gritty sure, but that's to be expected and what you want in an award winning cox wing shop. The wings are always large and juicy with many flavor to choose from.   I tend to always get the \"ATL\" or the \"Honey Habanero\". They are always a crowd pleaser for sure.   One thing to dive into is the different dry rubs they offer. Good times!!  Oh yea, they even have cool-aid on tap!!"}
{"text":"THE best wings I have had!  I've tried 3 different kinds of wings here and all 3 are my favorite..... so far.  The biscuits are amazing and the Kool Aid tops it off!  I have recommended this place to numerous people and they thank me after they try it. Way way better than any other wing place in town."}
{"text":"The wings here are so yummy and the service was good! We ordered the honey habanero, spicy atl, honey BBQ, a kids meal and the honey biscuits. Everything tasted great but my favorite was the spicy atl! Not the healthiest but they do have salads if you need some greens. Good wing spot though...I would recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Great wings!!! Try Atl style \"spicy\" if u like a little kick. Always very friendly here"}
{"text":"Always hesitant to try another atl location when I love the one in chandler az, but this location was just as good. Very friendly staff, clean location, great wings and the kool aid was flowing . This location is also a little closer to home for me than the chandler location!"}
{"text":"There is no better place for wings in the world!!! This place is a must!!!!!  They also have their biscuits that will blow your mind!!!  WARNING once you go you will be hooked!!!"}
{"text":"Great wings, great fries, great customer service! Best wing place I've found in the valley!"}
{"text":"The wings were great, I went on a day they had a special so I couldn't get a combo which didn't make sense. So a 6piece with fries and a drink ran me  almost $12 and it took a while for my food to come out but I get they got busy. Next time I know not to come on my lunch break. The wings were the best I've had in Phoenix so far though."}
{"text":"Hands down THE best wings that I've had.  They have the perfect crisp to them and the honey BBQ sauce is amazing.  I haven't had much luck finding decent wings but these are better than decent.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their delicious wing sauces."}
{"text":"I was RULL sad when Lousiana Fried Chicken closed down, but the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, and getting ATL out of the deal was pretty sweet. The ATL style wings are hands down my favorite - I get them with the ATL style fries (seeing a pattern here?) and sometimes the biscuits (DELICIOUS. GET THEM). The Cajun BBQ wings are also amazing, and my fiancé and I can both compromise on the medium wings (he would order Toxic if it was up to solely him, and I am more of a mild kinda girl). The employees have all been very friendly and helpful every time we've visited. Basically, wings are delicious, all their wings are even moreso delicious, go here and eat wings."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  They know their seasonings and can make combinations of rubs and sauces that knock your taste buds into week!  The biscuits are a must have: a combination of savory and sweet with honey and some delicious mix between funnel cake and donut!  Bonus points for the Kool Aids too.  When you go be sure to eat all of the foods!!!!!"}
{"text":"Better than wingstop point blank period! Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Simple menu. Great wings. 18 flavors! I ordered the honey habanero and they were delicious. $7.99 gets you 10 good sized wings. ATL also serves freshly made Kool-Aid (grape, tropical punch, and a blue one). It was super sweet but still good and full of nostalgic charm. The prices are a little high (that Kool-Aid was $3, but included free refills). Aside from wings, they had shrimp and fish (all fried) as well as a few sandwich and side options. There's a pretty decent kids menu (mac n cheese bites), and they only offer canned or bottled sodas (no fountain drinks there). The place was busy during lunch hour on a Friday, so the word of mouth on this place is strong. I'd say it's worthy of a second trip..."}
{"text":"Wow this place is the real deal. The bone in wings are super meaty and cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The sauces/rubs I've tried so far have all been good and taste homemade, even the ranch they came with was awesome. These are much better wings than you're going to get anywhere else around here, way better than wing stop/native new yorker/zipps.  Wings are normally $1/piece which is pretty standard and $.75/piece on Tuesday's. My only wish is that they threw some carrots & celery in there with the wings, but that's minor. Really hope these guys gets some good signage out front soon so they get the exposure they deserve."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will say the flavors were yummy!! We did a pick up so the little bit of customer service I did have it was good. My favorite flavor was Cajun bbq I will be going back when I'm on thay sode of town."}
{"text":"The wings are awesome among everything else on the menu! I loved the deep fried pancakes and the cheese fries (I know weird combo, but great). The Kool-Aid is my fav! It's made the way your little brother used to make it back in the day with half a bag of sugar!!! Great customer service! Everyone is so helpful! You will not be disappointed. Stop buying wings from places that serve junk from the freezer and get your wings from the experts!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the east valley, hands down! Sauces are always consistent, and wings size is just right. Cheese fries are great pairing with the wing and you get a free drink to go along with the two."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place! Now they even have a Tuesday special come while it lasts. The flavor for the sauces that I've tried so far are superb. The thing I love most is they don't have those tiny wings that were frozen first! It's always fresh it may take a few mins to get your food buts it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place still the greatest wing place ever great prices more food  customer service you should leave happy and full"}
{"text":"Lemon pepper wings are so good! Best wings in PHX area!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings, we stumbled across this place on accident & were pleasantly surprised. Great food & friendly service. We are definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Thank the heavens one member in the crew decided she wanted wings. We took a shot in the dark and found a jewel. Upon entering you get the sense that this place is for real.   I ordered the spicy ATL and extreme honey habanero. Both packed a punch of spiciness and flavor. Both didn't disappoint. The honey biscuits were one of the greatest things I've tasted on my trip here. And how can you go wrong with a place that has a Kool-Aid fountain?"}
{"text":"Things I love about ATL:  -The wings are crispy and there is variety aplenty (salivating seasoned ones, yum) -The side dishes (mac n cheese bites, okra, and sweet potato fries to name a few) -The fact that they allow all flats and mixing & matching in increments of 5 -The fried desserts -The kool-aid  Things I don't love:   -The fact that I have to wait so long for my food, even after calling in my order to prevent that very occurrence -The automatic %18 gratuity that is added despite the fact orders are placed at the counter and there are no servers -The stomachache I get every time I dine here (fried/greasy/fattening=delicious, but ultimately leads to discomfort)  Things I think could make it better:  -Table games. Cards, dominoes, chess! Something to ease the 45 minute wait. -Table side tubs of tums"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The wings are awesome! We ordered garlic Parmesan, honey habanero (my favorite), teriyaki, and spicy ATL. All of the wings were amazing!! On Tuesdays they have wings night! I highly recommend ATL wings! I can't wait to eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my vote for the best wings in town -  Sauce variety is top notch between dry ribs and sauce.  The wing pieces are HUGE.  Add a side of amazing ATlL fries and an ice cold cup of Kool Aid - so good.   For dessert, the honey biscuits are a great treat with a bit of honey and sugar.  The menu is simple and they do a great job including the Ranch dressing from scratch.  Thank you to Mike and everyone at ATL For making my Ranch Toxic wings unforgettably amazing"}
{"text":"Great place to get wings. The staff is fast and efficient. Love the Kool-aide. I always get ATL style but they have plenty of options for everyone. They have been pretty busy the last few times i have come for dinner, so expect a line, but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"After a long hard day at the office,  some BBQ wings sounded great. I found Alt Wings and the reviews looked great so here we are.    The staff was very friendly and helped us with a recommendation which was 12 wings and french fry's and how cool we got a free soda.    I loved the crushed ice they use instead of big cubes you find everywhere else.  The wings were deep fried and crispy.  The flavor was amazing and there was lots of BBQ sauce on the wings.  Very tasty and filling. 5 stars on the wings.  The frys were very tasty and not the typical frys you get at a fast food restaurant .  The only reason I gave 4 stars is there was way too much salt on the frys.  MAKE SURE TO TELL THEM LIGHT SALT and you will give them 5 stars for sure.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Man wings can't go no better than this. This place has multiple awards for their wings and fries you can't find seasoned anywhere. Better than Long Wongs, and KFC. Canes isn't even a factor here...!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, the place is clean as were the restrooms (based of two separate visits). The first time I got boneless wings with a honey spice sauce, 2nd time I got boneless lemon pepper. The lemon pepper, was too salty. The honey spice was decent, a little too sweet. The ATL fries was excellent! The koolaid is good as well. Fast service if you are looking for something filling and quick."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and his son and didn't really know what to expect of the wings but they were soooooo good! You really can't go wrong with any of the sauces either. We tried 6 different sauces and they were all great! They get really busy and you have to wait a while but the wings are definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First time we visited the nice lady helping us let us try their \"ATL Style\" wing and I knew then I was in love! And don't get me started on their honey biscuits! Good lord! Simple, you go here for wings and good home style service. One of the best wings in the valley, and I know wings!"}
{"text":"Umm, if I re-gain those 50+ pounds I left behind, I'm going to have to blame ATL Wings.   Not really, but that should give you an idea of how addictively delicious these wings are!   2013 and 2014 Winner of Wingstock, and rightfully so.   Huge, quality, meaty wings and solid wing sauce flavors at a great price ... What more could you ask for?   Oh yes, beer!   They don't have a liquor license just yet. Everytime we've stopped in, it's been take-out, so I just throw back a few San Tan Hefs at home.   You will, however find Red, Blue and Purple Kool-Aid on Tap!   My favorite flavors so far: Hot, Extreme Honey Habanero and Cajun Hot.   Knock off a star for the occasional rude customer service. It all depends on who is working the counter that day. Dude and I have encountered some serious trolls.  Oh, and for closing rather early. If they stayed open an hour later each day, I'm sure ATL would get even more business from late night drinkers seeking some munchies.  Stop by ATL Wings and get your wing fix, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Every other week we make this drive to ATL Wings for Chef's special and a side of house fries... complimentary drink? Why thank you ATL! We get thirsty in traffic. Please open one in Avondale now!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here a few times and I have to say the service is always great. Food is quick, staff always helpful and friendly. Very glad this franchise opened here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"#aroundchandler So I finally made it here. So much hype about this place. Now I don't consider myself your average wing eater. I eat a serious amount of buffalo wings. I even made it to state championship for a wing eating contest. The wings here are good. The wings them self are average, but the sauces are way above average.  I always judge wings based on the standard hot. The hot was fairly hot, but very tasty. I also tried the ATL rub. The flavor was fantastic. I'm not a cool aid drinker, I stay away from sugar. But the fact they had cool aid I thought was pretty cool.  I will be a regular here and will try all 18 flavors of wings!!   #chandleraz"}
{"text":"Amazing wings! Amazing fries! And amazing staff!   So many flavors to choose from. So far I've had the Cajun hot and honey habanero. Both are amazing!   The wings come out crispy and full of flavor! These are probably one of the most delicious wings I've had!"}
{"text":"So I came back. Had the medium wings and teriyaki wings. They were really good. I want to go back. Only thing is the service could be better."}
{"text":"The service was A1. The sauce was extra saucy and wings big and crispy. Fresh as hell. Made me a believer"}
{"text":"ATL might have the best wings in Phoenix.  Their wings are crispy. They are juicy. They are everything you ever wanted in a chicken wing and more.  So good the place is usually busy.  ATL has many flavors to choose from but I've only tried the ATL rub,  the spicy ATL rub and the buffalo sauce which were all delicious and full of flavor.    A couple things to keep in mind: they have kool-aid on tap,  if you place an order over the phone you have to prepay,  and once you try their wings you might get addicted."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmm mm love me some ATL lol. I'm hooked on the wings here! The hot and honey habanero are so delicious!! It makes my mouth salivate just thinking about them as I wrote this! I just wish y'all would answer the phone sometimes lol but hey I get it you guys are busy as hell bc it's so good!!"}
{"text":"ATL style & the classic Hot wings with the blue raspberry lemonade flavored Kool - Aid and the cinnamon sugar biscuits to top it off. Man! I'm smiling like the Kool - Aid pitcher character. Hot fresh & cooked to order."}
{"text":"It's definitely not the service that people line up for! Just unhappy and RUDE if it wasn't for the wings the biscuits the variety of seasoning I would never ever ever ever step foot in this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today after just moving over to this area. Have to say that all the reviews have this place pegged. These are some of the best wings and sauces I have had. We tried 5 different sauces and the Citrus and ATL were amazing. Will definetly be back!!! Thank you ATL wings!!!"}
{"text":"I woke up with a mad craving for some chicken wings, and coincidentally,  it's National Chicken Wing Day! I had to stop by my favorite wing place, ATL Wings.  Great flavor selection, wings cooked to perfection (crispy outside, juicy inside), ranch comes with your order(not extra) and kool aid on tap! Mmmmm, I'm drooling just thinking about it. Anyways, this visit my daughter and I had the lucky sweet red, and garlic pepper wings with fries and 2 drinks. Both flavors were delicious and cooked perfectly, fries were tasty as always. We paired our meals with blue raspberry and green apple kool aid, and let me tell you, we both left happy and full! If you haven't checked out ATL Wings, give it a shot. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL staff and superb service. Wings are the best in ARIZONA. Every flavor tastes good. Try the koolaide."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings in ARIZONA!! I love the lemon pepper chicken wings. They will make your wings crispy.  Koolaide is just right. Friendly staff at every location."}
{"text":"Finally!!  ATL opened in Scottsdale last week.  Consistent product, friendly service and oh yea, best chicken wings in town.  Sauces are amazing.  Keep it up ATL."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of ATL since they opened in Chandler a few years ago. I found myself in Phoenix tonight and was craving wings and of course my first thought was making the hike to ATL in Chandler. Much to my surprise there was a location in Phoenix! As soon as I walked in the new location struck me as clean, inviting and friendly even despite the fact it was 20 minutes before closing. The manager made me feel welcome immediately and never tried to rush me out when they started to close up. But that only covers the amazing service.  The food was AMAZING, and came out extremely fast. My favorite flavor is the honey habanero, but my boyfriend being a wing purist claims that their cajun hot is the way to go. I have never had a wing at ATL that I didn't like. The fries are perfect, and the honey biscuits are really something (although I usually can't handle eating more than one!)   Overall a perfect rating for this visit. I highly recommend it and urge everyone to give this location some LUV!"}
{"text":"Was intrigued by the name and the rating they have. Drove by a few times but had never been in. Wished I had gone sooner.  The place is a no-nonsense, bare-bones wing shop. But they do it well. Very Well. They have 18 flavors to pick from and you can go with regular or boneless. I went with Honey-Habenaro wings and they were great. Big, meaty wings - fired up crisp under a sauce with just the right amount of kick. They do have an extreme version that i may have to try. Price was good for the food amount.  they do have a few other menu items in fried shrimp plate and some chicken sandwiches but not sure why you would want to have that instead of the amazing wings. I will definitely be back to try the ATL style and some other flavors"}
{"text":"Move over KFC, ATL wings are the finger-lickin' good chicken of the moment! We stepped in here, hungry for wings and left satisfied and full. There are a plethora of flavors to choose from, from dry rub to sauce coated.  We decided on a dozen each of the ATL style, honey bbq, and lemon pepper. The ATL style was my favorite out of the three. It was a delightful mix of savory seasonings and went well with the crisp outer coating of the wings. The honey bbq was evenly coated, and had a good balance of tangy flavor and sweetness. The lemon pepper was a little too overpowering for me, as all I could taste was acidic lemon in each bite.  The wings themselves had very tender meat. The order, once placed, didn't take very long to make.  We also had some honey cinnamon biscuits. I was expecting more of a flaky buttermilk biscuit so I was surprised when they came out. They were more of a drop biscuit, tasting reminiscent of the Chinese style donuts you find at Asian buffets. I loved the light texture of the dough contrasting with the thick syrupy honey.  The fountain drinks are Coke-based, and there are 3 different Kool Aid flavors to choose from as well. Oh yeaaahh (In my best Kool-Aid man voice)!  There was a steady stream of customers coming in, dining in, and taking out orders. We came here around 6 P.M. on a Saturday and while it was busy, we had no problem finding a table.  Overall a great place to get wings."}
{"text":"They're great love the lemon pepper and honey habanero. I would get regular fries instead of Atl style next time though Wings had good crunch cooked well. Fries were the way I like them."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get wings. They open at 11 and it is usually busy right when they open. On my work from home days this is a spot I like to go for lunch. They have a nice selection of seasonings from sauces to rubs, you can get koolaid, and the staff is very friendly. It is not too far from my house so it is a frequent stop. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best wings I have ever had in the country. My friend took me here and told me that and I didn't believe it. When I came and ordered the wings and fries. It was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and they have a LOT of wing options! 6 dry rub choices, 9 BBQ, and 6 levels of heat on the Buffalo style (they call it red hot) up to toxic on the wings. You can choose traditional bone-in or boneless. They have blue cheese (weak, watery) & ranch. Weirdness? You can't even get celery & carrots with your wings?!?! I had the Honey Habanero, which were just the right amount of sweet & spicy. I had the boneless, which are basically nuggets....My co-diner had the mild which are VERY mild. All in all, good for fast food style environment."}
{"text":"I love all of the dry rubs, the traditional ATL is my favorite but I like the lemon pepper too. I got the bacon cheese fries last time and it was amazing. I loved watching them make the bacon right in front of me and chopping it up to put it on the fries.   Plus, everyone is super sweet. I observed a lady walk in and ask for free food she hinted that she was homeless and looking for a job. Without any hesitation the cashier put together a plate for her and offered to help her find a job the following day. Now that's what I call customer service."}
{"text":"Dry wings, poor customer service, and expensive. I'm better off going to Native or Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Every day is a blessing but when you discover the best wing shop in the West you hit the jackpot!    We just so happened to be in Phoenix and had a hankering for wings so we Yelped it and soon we were opening the door to ATL Wings.  The greeting was sincere and we proceed to the counter to order.    We opted for the garlic Parmesan wings, great choice.  They comped us a drink just for the heck of it and when we saw the kook-aid dispensers we knew we were in for some serious chow fun. Then to top it off the owner pulls up a chair and we had one of the nicest conversations. He said we gotta try the fries before we go so he has some delivered with a side of honey bbq sauce.  YUM.  Everyone needs to try this combo.  Then, wait, before we go he \"made\" us try the honey biscuits.   OMG.  So hot, so gooey and so dang delicious.   Something like a beignet without the trip to New Orleans.  What a treat.   Top quality, homemade goodness from beginning to end.  I know the secret to the success of this wing shop.  Truly it is All The Love - that my friend will keep you in business for many many years.   Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"This is the best wings in town and make sure to grab some honey. Biscuits I recommend ATL style wings my wife likes the teriyaki"}
{"text":"Ran into this place when dropping off some dry cleaning next door. So glad I ventured in. First service was great, girls behind counter where on it. Simple place Wings and Fries only, but after having the wings it's really all you want. Crip, fresh and cooked perfectly. If looking for a good wing have to put this on your must try list."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. A good sign when we always see it packed beyond belief. We ordered 6 lemon pepper and 6 chef's special wings with some ATL fries. The staff was fast and efficient and the order came out quickly. Bottom line-the wings were great! Special shout out on the chef's special wings-the sauce had a good depth to it and you could see the herbs and spices in it which was unique. Very flavorful-I highly recommend. I also have to say that along with being efficient and friendly, the staff didn't stop moving the entire time we were there. When the two gals there weren't helping customers, they were cleaning the dining room area-why it was spotless. Good first visit-we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The ATL on Thomas used to be a good place to get really good wings but lately they are slippin. The last few times I've been there the front doors are locked at 11:15 when the sign is lit up saying \"open\" and the front door itself says they open at 11:00. The honey habanero used to be my go to wing favor but whoever they got now making the wings really sucks. Tasted more like teriyaki sauce than anything. The place is filthy dirty and I'm surprised they haven't been dinged yet from the health inspector. The people they got now working there all look like they shoot heroin in the back of the store on their break. I'm afraid to go back to this location in fear of catching something..."}
{"text":"Stoped in today at 5:20 after calling in my order. Wings tasted great.... after i broiled them at home. Could have had a happy customer but after dealing with the service, I don't know if I even want to bother again.  Wings are amazing but the customer service IS HORRIBLE. After first calling in my order, I even called back right away and asked to have them done extra extra extra crispy. I was told there wings are normally done crispy but that they will be crispier. The girl sounded annoyed when I called back and tried to rush me off the phone. I work in the customer service industry and have never felt so unwelcome. I wish the girl up front listened to me for two seconds because it could have been a whole different experience but instead I was made to feel as if I was interrupting on her and her co workers time.   Also didn't understand how you don't get a cup of ranch with every order. Had to pay for an extra ranch. Annoyed with this whole experience.   Came in again for a second time with my sister to try the place out. I will never return here again, nor will I recommend this place. It's sad because the quality of wings is amazing but the staff is TOO RUDE to get past. Your staff has attitudes and hoards ranch. If you purchase 18 wings and ask for extra ranch all you get told is that it comes with ranch with the biggest ghetto attitude. Um... I asked for MORE THAN TWO but okay."}
{"text":"These wings are #bomb! Tried the boneless style wings and they are a pretty good size with not much breading --more meat is always a plus! I recommend the chef special sauce, soooo delicious! The honey habanero is not spicy at all so if you're looking for something spicy then try another sauce. However, it's still pretty tasty, with more of a honey flavor. Also, the honey biscuits were amaziiiing! And great customer service for being very busy on a Sat night"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews of this place, wanted to give it a try. The place was busy, with only a few tables open. The tables that were open were dirty, and no one seemed concerned about cleaning them. I took some paper towels and cleaned the table. I ordered the Cajun Hot (6 each) and Cajun BBQ (6 each) and a pop for $13.07.  Went to the bathroom, and they only have one for both sexes... hence it was not the best. The toilet was stopped up, from the last customer, who left a parting gift.  After I got my food, the wings did not seem to be hot (temperature wise). Which is odd, because I know they make them fresh to order... I can only guess, they are using cold sauces, which cools down the wings...so the wings were flavorful, but only get 3 stars.  My friend ordered the boneless wings, which looked like one inch mini-nuggets. When I asked him how he liked them he responded, \"Ehhhh, they will make a turd.\"  I joked and told him, \"A very tiny one..\" So I guess a 3 is about the best I could give this place. Not the best but not the worst either."}
{"text":"The cajun hot sauce is soooooo good. They are really nice here. They even lets us try the scauce.  Came here with with my man and hus fav cuz. When not only had fun but ate well. Very delicious. They even have kool-aid. Awesome!"}
{"text":"So, about a year ago I stumbled upon this place when I had a massive craving for wings and google searched for nearby places that had them. I'm a fan of wings in general and Teakwoods is generally my go-to place to get awesome wings, but this place was open and close by so I figured I'd give it a try.   OMG, I am so glad I did! When you walk in they have big, legible signs that tell you exactly what they have so you don't have to go through menus or guess around. The front staff is super nice and can help with suggestions if you've never eaten there before. They make the sauces fresh and even though it does take a little time it is WELL worth the wait!  The chicken wings themselves are HUGE compared to most wings you get anywhere else and the sauces are sooo good! You can tell they really take pride in making their product #1! They also have fried fish which looks delicious but I can never save enough room to ever try it. Here's the bonus to top it all off: They have Kool-Aid on fountain! Who else is awesome enough to have Kool-Aid? No one!  They are my new favorite go-to place for wings. If you have a craving for amazing wings and want to try something new try ATL, you will NOT be disappointed!  **Update** I finally got around to trying the breaded tilapia- it's awesome. ATL can do no wrong!"}
{"text":"I keep flying in from Dallas to eat here! I'm obsessed! Everything is soooo good!!!!!! the kool-aid is amazing! Wings are perfection! I've lived in a few different states! I could never live in Arizona but I'd keep coming back for these wings! Expand to Dallas plz"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Best wings around. Great service, great prices. Always fast for ordering and has a great selection."}
{"text":"I came in on Super Bowl day and this place was a complete disaster! They messed up my order and the manager was extremely rude. I do not recommend coming to this place because the customer service is very bad."}
{"text":"Ive been to many wing places in my life, but have never tasted wings this good. Had the lemon pepper and garlic parmesan today for lunch, with some kool aid :) Best Wings by far!!!"}
{"text":"LAST UPDATE!!!  I got an email from restaurant.com this morning, it's official! Since ATL Wings doesn't know how to respect  their customers and they ignored their contract and policies with restaurant.com, they have been removed from the discount program. I was allowed to get another certificate to a different restaurant in exchange for the hassle we went through.   ATL Wings, my employer gave you the opportunity to fix this but you decided that it's more important to overcharge your customers with invalid fees just so you can keep the extra cash. You took the gamble and you lost on this one."}
{"text":"Just left the new location on McClintock and Southern. It was a my first time trying it and I was disappointed. EVERYTHING was soooo greasy!!! I've never seen chicken grease soak through both an aluminum pan and brown paper bag. If there are other less greasy locations I would be happy to give it another shot, because it smelled good."}
{"text":"Best wings I've tasted in a long time!  Service is great and the wings are better.  Had medium and garlic parm....they are perfect.  Will go back soon for sure."}
{"text":"the best wings ever. forget bww go support these guys!"}
{"text":"I said in a previous review that I hoped this place would give me a reason to give them five stars.  And they did not disappoint!  FIVE STARS ACROSS THE BOARD.  I had a sleepover/staycation at a Scottsdale resort for my niece and four of her friends and decided I would make some side dishes and pick up wings for dinner.  Went in a few hours before I needed to pick up to place the order and pay for everything.  It was tricky since I was ordering for teenagers plus ordering some for my husband who took the 10 year old nephew for the night.   Sorry, I am horrible with names but they were younger-- (aged mid twenties?)--the girls that helped me we so accommodating when I explained what I needed.  They let me taste sauces and helped me guess what a teenage palate would like.  I got a mix of plain boneless wings with dipping sauces and bone-in medium and honey habanero.  (120 wings total) They were kind enough to package some separately for the boys.  My order was hot and ready at the exact time I asked for it to be ready.  AND my bone-in wings were the perfect extra well done way that I asked for!  Thank you so much.  Everyone loved the wings!"}
{"text":"Flew in for my sons orientation at ASU and stopped for wings. These are the best wings ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried ATL Wings for the first time today. It's was pretty good. Wings were nice and fresh. I ordered Lemon Pepper and also Medium wings. The Lemon Pepper were a bit salty but they were still good. I consider them to be even better than Wingstop and BWW. I'd go back"}
{"text":"I have to give these fine folks 5 stars for the sheer size of their wings, the many choices of dry rubbed and sauced wing flavors and the super-delicious fries.  Wowza!  We came in on a Sunday afternoon and there was a steady stream of customers.  We were greeted quickly and placed our order.  They let you sample the sauces if you like, which is great if you are undecided.  If you buy wings and a side of fried you get a free drink.  So cool!  We tried the Garlic Parmesan bone-in wings with a sides of fries.  The wings are nice and crispy and BIG!  I would have liked Parmesan on the side to be sprinkled on the wings, but these were still good on their own.  Their fries are incredible.  I don't know if they are hand cut or what, but I ate every fry and the side order is pretty big.  They make their ranch in house and it was so good.  We also tried their biscuits covered in honey and topped with cinnamon and sugar.  Yummy treat to finish the meal!  They have three different kinds of kool-aid and sodas to drink.  This is a great place.  Definitely worth a return visit to try the other flavors!"}
{"text":"They have been so nice these past 2 time we have cane here . They also offered us samples when we had only asked for their opinion on the wings !great customer service. Best wings I have had !"}
{"text":"Bomb dot com wings. Love the garlic pepper dry rub! Love the vibe and I the fact that they serve kool -aid!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but too much sodium, msg... was dried out completely afterwards... tasted really good, 5 star taste, 3 star after effect! Had spicy atl style"}
{"text":"So happy!! I have been waiting to try ATL Wings and my dream finally came true today. Let me tell you from the moment we walked in I was happy. Greeted loud and proud, with a Welcome to ATL, followed up by a perfect question of it was our first time. The employee was happy to hear it was our first time and immediately started asking what our likes and dislikes were about Wings then started to offer flavors in which she thought would best suit us. We received a sample of the ATL Style wing which I almost shed a tear from, so crispy and flavorful. I decided to go with the Cajun BBQ, my wife chose medium flavor, and my daughter was also impressed with the ATL Style wing she ordered them. We also placed an order of fries along with drinks of course.   Cajun BBQ was definitely Cajun and it kicks I highly recommend it! The ATL style is like a peppery rub with a hint of butter flavors, and medium was medium lol. Thing about these wings though is that they were crispy, juicy and big! The fries had the skins on em and they reminded of the fair!   I'm coming back to try some more flavors and you should too! See you there."}
{"text":"Best wings in town.  Wings done fresh so you may have to wait a bit but when they hit the table you are in for flavor town!  All flavors have been great, so step outside your comfort zone and try something different.  Also they give you a wing when you want to try a flavor, definitely helps make your choice easy."}
{"text":"Oh my sweet honey BBQ wings!!! Boyfriend and I had been wanting to check this place out for a while so we visited tonight. We were NOT disappointed. The owner was taking orders and we told her we had never been in and inquired about the ATL style rub. She gave us a sample of the rub with some fresh hot chicken wings. WOW!!!! That rub was insanely delicious as were the Honey BBQ and Honey Habanero that we actually ordered. The biscuits with cinnamon and honey were to die for as well!   Also, they have fountain Kool-Aid in blue (not sure of flavor), fruit punch and grape!   Check this place out if you're looking for a clean establishment with amazing food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Garlic Parm is the bomb!!!! And there cajun fries great and you get alot.  And kool-aid what more can you ask for Chicken Fries and Kool-aid what more can ask for."}
{"text":"I use to go to the 40th st location all the time for lunch so glad they opened this location by my house.  I mostly go for don Tuesdays 65cent wings can't beat it!!!! Fries ATL style and those Honey Habanero wings keep me coming back.  Nice vibe always jamming the oldies but goodies. Staff is friendly as well Great wings spot and they also serve Kool-aid"}
{"text":"I LOVE ATL wings! We used to drive out to Mesa b/c they are so good. But the service is terrible. So terrible, we go other places now, even though this place is around the corner.  If you call for pick up, they sound irritated and put you on hold. Worse yet, if you call in within an hour of them closing, they won't take your order.   If you're okay to get rude service or risk no service at all, it's worth it. Their wings are the best."}
{"text":"AMAZING WINGS! Wish it was closer to my house. The place seems a little ghetto and next to a huge smoke shop, but man those wings are GOOD! Also the staff was really welcoming and even let us sample 2 wings since we had no idea what \"atl style\" was. One of the best assets of this place is how they sell KOOL AID!!!! I loved everything about this place. The only thing that was a little annoying was that at night they have bright red neon lights inside. It looks really cool but its hard to see what the food exactly looks like because everything is in shades of red. Maybe it would work better if they had a mixture of white lights at each table? At least you feel a little more private with the red darkness.  PROS Food, Staff, Drinks  CONS Red lights"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the staff is amazing. The owners are extremely nice and always seem to care about you on a personal level. The wings are always saucy and  all the sauces here are amazing! My favorites are Lucky's sweet red, honey mustard, honey habanero, chef's special, and garlic Pepper! Don't forget they have 75 cent wing Tuesday every Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This location has suffered with the hopes and dreams of other restaurants before but I'm thinking Atl (short for Atl Georgia!) Wings might be here to stay. If you like wings then you will not be disappointed with an eclectic variety of sauces and dry rubs to choose from. The chef in the back was on point using his clock to ensure he didn't burn our order. In addition the food comes out quick so you shouldn't be waiting more than 5-7 minutes to get your food once you've ordered. The staff was extremely friendly and they offered us samples (I had to take a rain check on those biscuits but I shall return like MacArthur) in addition they changed the channel from Shrek 6 to ESPN so I could watch a little Euro Cup. The highlight of my experience was trying all three varieties of Kool-Aid on tap including red, blue and purple. After my sugar coma was complete I definitely left with a mild case of diabetes. It's not health food being served so if you are preparing for swimming suit season then this is not the place for you. I think Atl wings might be the cure for that Saturday night hangover I will be nursing next weekend."}
{"text":"Bomb wings  and flavors. I chose the dry  atl spicy  it was seasoned  well & spicy. The koolaid  was perfectly sweet. I asked  if the fries had a sweet  salty  seasoning  like wingstop  & the cashier dang near  went off  with  all kinds of attitude. I explained to her i dont  like wingstop  seasoning  so I  just  wanted to make sure atl wings  didnt  do a similar seasoning.  I got the fries & could have  done without  fries  all together.  Thier  fried biscuits  are really good compliment.  The sauced honey  bbq  wings  were  great.  I left Arizona  and  craved atl  wings.  They are  pretty  quick.  Sometimes  you have  to overlook some of the  ghetto folks that come in. Dont be alarmed  they are  just  there  for the food  like you. Its  worth the stop for sure. Arizona  has 3 locations  for  you to choose from."}
{"text":"I've heard great things so we decided to try! We ordered from DoorDash because I have a small baby and couldn't get out of the house. My 10 yr old ordered the medium and absolutely loved them. My hubby got teriyaki. I got boneless ATL style. We all loved them. The homemade ranch is BOMB. I can practically drink the stuff. My 10 yr old got birthday money and all he wanted was to return to ATL wings! I took him on a Tuesday since wings are on sale. He tried calling 13 times with no answer. I drove him down there and there was a long line. It went pretty fast though and was worth the wait. The wings were great. I will definitely continue coming here! Can't wait to try more flavors."}
{"text":"The spicy ATL wings are the best wings ever...if only they'd answer the phone.  Your best bet is to go in ahead of time.  You'll be tempted to get sauces but get the atl or spicy atl and just dip them, so much better.  Teriyaki is my favorite!"}
{"text":"So far these are some of the tastiest wings around the valley, the Spicy ATL wings are truly the best tasting wings they have, with the right amount of heat without being to overbearingly hot, and they ALWAYS come out with the perfect crispiness and consistent. They do have many choices of flavors. to suit your taste and even have Kool Aid, that's a plus!!!"}
{"text":"THESE ARE MY FAVORITE WINGS!!! You walk in and you always get greeted by their friendly staff. While your standing in line you catch yourself dancing, they always play the best music(r&b and love songs) you get up and you get to choose from the best flavors. My favorite is the chefs special, very flavorful with the right amount of kick. My fiancé favorite flavor is the lucky sweet red, very flavorful(not an overwhelming taste of sweetness) with just a kiss of spice. Very happy this place can cater to your orders(they let you choose if you want a mixture of wings or flat or if you just want all flats or all wings) very affordable and very delicious  ohhhh and your worst mistake is NOT GETTING THERE FRENCH FRIES! ATL style! There delicious food and atmosphere is what keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Only giving this place 3 stars because they have really cut down on their menu and just recently have changed the type of fries they use. The used to be exceptionally good but I tried them recently and they were horrible. The wings have always been good and that is what they are know for. They are Wingstock winners 3 years in a row (2013, 2014, & 2015)!   My kids really like the ATL style wings. These are a specially seasoned wing with really good flavor. I used to order the ATL stay but was recently introduced to Honey Habanero which are are also really good. Tuesday's are .60 wings. They get really crowded so it's a good ideas to call in your order. They also get really crowded at lunch time. So call ahead!"}
{"text":"The people who work here are friendly and efficient. I support business that are professional. Keep it up ATL wings"}
{"text":"I've heard lots of good things about this place, and since I was in the area today I thought I would swing in and grab a bite to see what all the hoopla was about.    The menu itself is ample with a variety of selection, but I swear I waited half a lifetime to place my order.  I was hungry and we were the only one's standing there, so I'm not sure what the holdup was, but I started getting ansy.  Eventually a lady took our order and we sat and waited while our food was prepped.  I went with the 3 chicken strips, fries and a drink combo platter and my friend went with the wing plate himself.  Overall the food was good, but I was a little irritated with the long wait.    Also, part two of my experience was a combination of the crabby lady behind the counter who took our order and the bathroom situation. They kind of go hand in hand.  For starters, she was kind of rude and cold to me.  I wasn't sure why, but it got worse as the lunch went on.    my breaking point with her was when I tried to use the ladies room only to realize they were out of toilet paper. I came out to the counter to mention it to her, and I basically got completely blown off.  For starters, the guy mixing wings behind the counter totally ignored me when I started talking.  Then, the rude lady heard me, poked her head out from the back, saw me, and went back behind the wall to finish her conversation on her I phone. I couldn't wait any longer so I went into the men's room since apparently whatever I had needed was of no importance to her.  After I was done, I came back around to the counter and she was done talking on her cell phone. I told her she was out of toilet paper in the ladies room, and she screamed over her shoulder to some guy to go take care of it.  I can deal with a wait for the food, but the crabby lady just makes me think twice about coming back here, along with no toilet paper in the bathroom as well.  The food is okay, but I just don't know about doing a drive down here again for this place....."}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews. First timer and a forever customer. Friendly staff and food was great!!! Im a wing lover so nothing beat long wongs until now. They are basically the same as long wongs if not better! Fries are AWESOME.  Ranch is AWESOME.  Wings and wing sauce are AWESOME!!  Kinda pricey but i dont mind if wings are awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was great the young up front was super nice. The guy cooking was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Meh...  It was alright.   I'm use to boneless tenders from wings over east Lansing.   These were just boneless balls of meat.   Found a few chewy pieces as well which took away my appetite.   Good but there's gotta be better in the valley."}
{"text":"Claims that Tuesday they have 75 cent wings. That's a lie! I went to order and the lady wanted to charge me full price. What a shame! Don't advertise something on your website if you can't honor it. Go to wingstop instead."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars because their wings and sugar biscuits are sooo good. But...I will say, calling in an order takes patience. They either don't answer their phone or put you on hold so long that \"somehow\" you end up being disconnected. I would suggest adding an online ordering feature to their website so answering the phone doesn't take away from attending to their customers at the register yet they still get the business from both rather than the caller giving up and ordering Wingstop instead."}
{"text":"I love hot wings and I've tried many places but ATL Wings have the best wings I've ever tried by far! The Hot are Perfect every time and the lemon pepper are A1. I tell everyone in my family and all my friends about this place. D Best"}
{"text":"Best wings hands down! I get all flats ( charge a little extra but it's worth it) hot and cheese fries.  Wings are crispy and spicy, but not crazy spicy.  With my first child, all I craved was hot wings and cheese so they got me through my first trimester while I was sick! Now being pregnant for the second time, I'm am thankful to live in close driving range to here!"}
{"text":"First time here and let me say. This place was so damn delicious. I had the chef sauce and my son had the garlic Parmesan and it was literally so mouth watering and the Cajun French fries add a nice kick. Plus the music in the environment makes me want to go out dance. The staff is also fun and very kind."}
{"text":"Best wings in the valley. There are others that are close, but these are big meaty wings. Staff is amazing and the biscuits bring almost as much joy as having your first child. They are that good. You can't be a \"wing guy\" and not have come to this place."}
{"text":"I work around the corner, and clients kept bringing in wings, so we stopped in. OMG! First, we were greeted with friendly, smiling faces.  They were closed, but we were still catered to as if the kitchen was still serving.  Cianna, one of the owners, was extremely personable, as we stayed beyond our welcome.  I was leary of the place since the location sat vacant for such a long time. The place is immaculent. No stains on the floor, tables and counter clean, and I love how you can see in the kitchen.  Everyone that was there that evening had smiles!  Now, to get down to the food! OMG, OMG, O-M-G!!! I got just some seasoned wings. They were delicious!! The fries are on point, but the honey biscuit, that honey biscuit, is just ignorant (in a good way). There is no way that a deep fried biscuit drenched in honey should taste sooooo good. That biscuit made my eyes roll to the back of my head. There are so many things on the menu that I will be back to try them out.  Can't wait to be blessed with another day so I can get my eat on!  PS I'm gonna have every one of my clients in there!!!"}
{"text":"The best wings in Arizona!!!!!!! I really love the ranch. I also like how they let you try a Wing if you a first time Comer."}
{"text":"Will not return placed a phone order for pickup.  Get there ignored not even acknowledged.   If cc is charged will dispute it.    Their wings are not that good"}
{"text":"So I saw the\"now open\" sign for this place last week and told myself the next time I had a taste for wings I would come here...well I had a taste earlier this week and forgot about them and went to my usual spot Wingstop, as usual my wings were just OK, not as good as they used to be years back when I practically lived at Wingstop.   So l made the decision that l would no longer waste my money with them and their mediocre wings and I continued my quest to find the perfect wings..and I've found them here at ATL Wings, upon entering everyone was very friendly and welcoming. The cashier asked if this was my first there when l began to inquire about the most popular wings, I told her it was and she suggested a spicy rub (atl spicy) which she offered me a sample of. The end result was me ordering the atl spicy, lemon pepper and I told her to surprise me with another flavor.  The Atl spicy is SPICY..that or I'm a wimp lol, they were good though, the lemon pepper was just right not to lemony with the right amount of salt, now the surprise was really good I just can't figure out what flavor it was, wasn't too sweet or spicy but it was good - the cashier told me she'd tell me what kind they were when I come back, so I will update my review then.  Now normally I have to tell Wingstop how to cook my wings, double check my order before I leave and sometimes have them remake them because they're not prepared as I asked. Not these wings, my wings were cooked to perfection, they were crispy, meaty and sauced just right. My only complaint would probably be that they're not open late but my greedy ass shouldn't be eating late anyway lol.  My search for the perfect wings is over and this considering this place is less than a mile from me, I couldn't be more pleased."}
{"text":"Tried their 75 cent wings special on Tuesday. Got the traditional ATL Wings. Wasn't really a fan but my friends really enjoyed the lemon pepper style wings so that might be better. Deff do NOT get the fries. They're pretty horrendous. Besides the food----had a fair amount of seating, fast food place style atmosphere, had a parking lot available, and quick service."}
{"text":"Wings were ok but all the stars go to their biscuits! Savory and sweet goodness. I actually liked the boneless more than the bone in, the bone in was a little dry and fried too much.  Its a small little place so be ready to squeeze if you have a big group.  It's a fun casual place... again biscuits to die for."}
{"text":"Fun!  The dry spicey wings are spicey tasty and crispy goodness. The cajun spicey are not quite as spicey but good a little soggier than I care for but they were to go.  All in all I enjoyed the wings but a little pricey for chicken wings even though it seems to be the trend. I will be back for sure.. the gal that took my order and put it together was a bombshell.. pinup and sweet as molasses."}
{"text":"18 Pc traditional (bone in) wings $17.85. No additional charge for ranch. Added a large drink & the total bill was $22.19. That's Fair! The wings are cooked to perfection and a descent size. Tossed with just the right amount of sauce. Although, I would have like to have slopped up a lot more of at Lucky Sweet Reds! LOL Many options of sauces and dry rubs to choose from too! Good customer service. Only two employees on staff: however professional & pleasant. I will be back. Wings are our thing!! LOL"}
{"text":"Awesome saucy wings! Full of flavor and they do wings right! Cooked to perfection! Chicken wing are decent sized. Options - Traditional or Boneless!   Seasoned and regular fries. Super good ( made fresh in house) and like I said; \"they do wings the right way\". Crispy & doused in sauce. YUM!   Cool thing- there's a Koolaid machine : unlimited koolaid along with them amazing wings! Offer other typical fountain drinks as well.   Had an awesome filling lunch here today. For less than $20 bucks a great meal for 2. We did the 12 count wings, regular fries & a drink.   The employees were great! Chill atmosphere  Kind of a little hole in the wall, but the wings are really delicious! They've won awards for their wings, so that should tell you something. Best sauce ( in my opinion )is the Lucky's Sweet Red, hands down!  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and it's amazing! Steph was the cashier and she was so incredibly nice! Will definitely make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Best wings and best kool-aid on tap. I always regret going to other wing places because they don't compare to ATL.   I know it's unhealthy to eat wings every week, but they're atl seasoned fries and honey mustard/honey BBQ wings with kool-aid is so had to resist. Plus they have punch cards so ask for that if because i guarantee you will be a frequent eater of this joint.   The staff is so cool too! This place really never disappoints."}
{"text":"Would love to give this place 5 stars but just cannot since to get 5 stars they would have to provide celery and carrots with their wing orders.  Other than that little thing everything here is great. 18 different flavors of wings.  The dry rub ATL are great as well as the citrus chipotle as my top two.  A unique item is kool aid for the kids. Decor is sparse but the food is great."}
{"text":"Been multiple times, good food every time. But tonight when a fight almost took place and I was with my family. Employee was keeping customers indoors to protect us. I'm sorry this needs to be addressed and dealt with."}
{"text":"Lemon pepper wings are delicious. Not crazy about the mild buffalo.. could've used a little more sauce. They do have fast service."}
{"text":"Awesome wings. I usually don't care for wings however these ones made me a believer. There biscuits are also very good!"}
{"text":"To echo what a number of Yelpers have already said, the wings here are, in a word, LEGIT. Envision me as MC Hammer pantomiming the 2 Legit 2 Quit hand jive, except I'll add the final move of sucking wing sauce off my sticky mitt. After dining at ATL Wings, you'll want to do the same.  The best thing about the wings here are that they are crispy and they are sauced right. I won't advise on what's the best flavor, because everyone has their preferences, but you can't go wrong by sampling a bunch of their 14 different wing flavors. You may even find a new favorite. I'm leaning towards the Citrus Chipotle and the Sweet 'n' Tangy, but then I haven't tried them all.  A note about the Sweet 'n' Tangy wings. Not really sweet nor tangy... but delicious nonetheless. I would say that these are more salty and sweet, with a soy-sauce-forward note. I found myself strangely addicted to these and unable to quit stuffing them down my grateful gullet.  I pray I will return to ATL Wings many times and try all their different styles of wings. But that's why we pray... we got to pray just to make it today. (Dear Lord, that's two MC Hammer references in the same Yelp review. I am no longer responsible for my own actions...)"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite wing place. You walk in and you are immediately enveloped with the smell of fried chicken and the various sauces. We ordered the Sweet Lenny and Medium wings with the ATL style French Fries (they add their house Cajun seasoning). Within 5 minutes our order was ready and we were on our way. Twelve minutes later we were back home. The wings were still crispy with the right amount of sauce, the fries literally were still steaming. The cherry on the sundae was they serve kool-aid! All and all a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"I too was leery of this place at first but DAMN was I 100% surprised.  I stop into this joint at least 3 times a week. The wings are bomb and the catfish sandwitch is off the hinges!  Yes, it does take a bit for you to get your food but it is cooked fresh...!! I will wait a few to have my stuff hot when I get it.  I have heard a few people upset with the prices and what I say to that is get over it!!  The food is super bomb and please remember that these folks are here to make a PROFIT.  I can't find anything bad to say.  All I want to know is when is there going to be a location opened in Phoenix???"}
{"text":"Good wings good service. The wings are good sized and tasty and juicy. Had the lemon pepper rubbed wings. Flavor was good but a little salty. Went back for the ATL spicy sauced wings and they were great. I have to get 10 more to go. The down side was the paper towel holders. Only 3 in the whole place and you have to pass them around. Get 1 per table please. Regular French fries were a good sized order but again just a little too much salt but had a sweet kick to them. If you like kool aid they have it, but was like a glass of instant diabetes. Gross just because you had it when you grew up doesn't mean you need it as an adult. Plus they gotta work on the drink prices. $2.50 for a 20 oz cup is a joke. tatted up counter girl was pleasant. Definitely my #1 wing spot for now and for sure in Glendale!"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked into this joint, I knew These wings had found a home in my belly. I loved the ATL Spicy rub and the regular wasn't bad either. I had a regular tea (I can't have sugar) it was great service from top to bottom as well. They seem to have a following as well.   My only qualms was the fact we couldn't get any beer (I don't drink beer but the guy I was with did). If I lived in Phoenix I would eat here weekly."}
{"text":"Great wings, get the dry rubbed, especially the Spicy ATL. Crispy texture and not over-saucing is why these are so good. I see comments below about the customer service, but I've never had issues."}
{"text":"Great wings! I ordered 10 piece wings and only got 5 I wish they could improve getting orders right after long time of waiting. I'm a first timer with patience and got home and my partner still hungry. Not what expected from #ATLWINGS"}
{"text":"This is my fav wing spot literally the best wings in AZ , sometimes you have to wait a lil bit but at the end it's worth it. I recommend \"ranch\" and \"lemon pepper\" style wings!!!!!"}
{"text":"Most delicious wings we have ever had!! Definitely worth the 30 minute drive! The honey biscuits were also delicious."}
{"text":"Love the crunchy exterior of the wings, and they have a fairly wide selection of flavors to choose from. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our family comes here once a week! Amazing wings , service is horrible , but the wings make us keep coming back! The food not the people !"}
{"text":"Yum yum and super yummy! Super nice staff, very welcoming and helpful to the rookies deciding on which of the vast dry rubs and sauces to select. Went for the ATL, honey habanero, and garlic parmesan. All delish! Generous portion of fries which were equally good. Made to order so don't expect order to be ready super quick but not long of a wait, maybe ten minutes, which seemed reasonable given the steady stream of customers. No frills atmosphere but comfortable space to eat at. Will be back when nearby."}
{"text":"I try to make my way to ATL Wings at least once every two weeks as they literally have the best variety of flavors wings in town.  You have the option to get traditional wings or boneless wings and with that you can add different flavors. Dry rub which consist of ATL style, spicy lemon pepper, ranch, garlic Parmesan and garlic pepper. Or you could do BBQ which has honey barbecue, Cajun barbecue, extremely hot habanero, honey habanero, sweet and tangy the list goes on. If you're really trying to do it you can get the red hot flavors which consist of mild, medium, chef special, Cajun hot, hot and ultimate tonic. Think I'll pass on that one...  CC is the best when it comes to getting your order in as she is awesome at the counter. If you're not sure what you want she pretty much knows the menu without looking and can help you to decide on which flavors to get depending on your mood or if your serous to step it up a notch with the tonic or  make it a combo and get the best value for your meal. (Long run on sentence... oh well)  Tonight I went with garlic parm & lemon pepper along with Cajun fries and the salad. The salad needs some work as it was looking flimsy with only lettuce, shredded carrots & cheese. It needed some tomatoes and cucumbers.   I'm even more thrilled they accept ApplePay!   Solid wings, solid flavors and with the offering of some good koolaid... red, blue & green (I think), your all set!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great people and great food. The amount of food you get for your money is also great!! I look forward to going here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The wings were very juicy and had the right amount of crisp to them. Some establishments that serve wings can make them too vinegary, but that wasn't the case here. There is a moderate amount of room for improvement. When you walk in, you are hit with warm air and a noticeable smell equivalent to sewage but not too bad to make you leave. It was much more noticeable near the fountain drink area. When ordering, you can see the kitchen very clear and it looks like there isn't much help and it's slightly messy/unorganized. I ordered 10pc bone-in medium hot wings with a drink but according to my receipt I was charged for the wings & fries instead of a drink. I wasn't caught up on that, it was just a dollar extra, no need to make a scene. The wings took about 3 minutes to be served and they were hot and fully cooked. As I was dining, more customers began to come in, and a woman had her baby barefoot on the counter while ordering. I wish they politely asked her to keep her child off the counter, as customers such as myself would find that very rude and unsanitary. Other than environmental issues, the food is of great quality and I would definitely return, but maybe for takeout instead."}
{"text":"I got mild wings and fries my first time here they were good. Obviously its just a place to have some wings. And I rarely crave wings so I might not come here to often. Just once and a great while.."}
{"text":"I love wings and ATL has been on my radar for a while.  When a group of my friends wanted to go there, I was super excited, but I had heard mixed reviews from a few other friends that have tried it before.    We went on Sunday around lunch time.  It was decently busy, but they were efficient.  When they heard it was my first time, they gave me a free wing with the ATL rub.  It was tasty.  I ordered 5 ATL and 5 garlic parm.  Both were good.  My friends loved the Kool-aid.  They tried the ATL cakes too and said it was similar to a funnel cake.    I will definitely be back to try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Pure disappointment. For 21.00 I got 6 bone in wings, beyond salty fries with cheese on the side and chicken nuggets... Seriously. I tasted the sauce for that wings and it tasted totally different once on the wings... Probably because they reused the mixing bowls. The fries were with extra salt (not requested) and the cheese wasn't anywhere to be found. Plus they were soggy so I'm glad I didn't have them put cheese wiz on them. And the boneless wings- 10.00 for ten (10) McDonald's sized nuggets. I should have went .02 miles to wing stop or a couple blocks further to raisin canes and got better food for cheaper. First and last time there."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had wings this good in Arizona. I love chicken wings more then anything and super picky about them. ATL has some of the best wings ever. The Lemon Pepper blow Wingstop out of the water. Also on Tuesdays you pay 70 cents a wing. Also for dessert they have these biscuit type treats that are covered in powdered sugar and honey. One of the most unique yet tasty treats for after. Also, they have KOOL-Aide as a choice of beverage. Which is even more a plus!"}
{"text":"I've been to the location on Thomas and 40th Street  and have  been dying to go back! To my surprise there is another location on 51st Ave and Northern! The service was good, friendly, family business feel, even the kids work! The  sauce was amazing! Kool-Aid fountain drinks! Unfortunately the ATL fries didn't seem as good as the ones their other location. I got the boneless wings which was a mistake, they were literally the smallest Wings I've ever eatin, like small chicken nuggets. I probably won't go back to this location but I'm still a fan of ATL wings!"}
{"text":"Listen... look at my face when you read this. The wings are are AMAZING! I had the lemon pepper and my wife had the toxic. The staff was very friendly and the prices are reasonable for the size and flavor quality of the wings. I plan on trying every flavor because I may have fallen in love with this place. I took a bite and a baby Angel kissed me on the cheek. Seriously though great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Ok their food is amazing, best fried okra ever! I loved the wings and honey biscuits too. We ordered the jalapeno poppers and kid you not only 3 of 10 had filling...so one was high (they admitted it to the store no joke!) hobenero wings were great but not spicy at all. Now since the biscuits made up for the poppers, id love to give a 4 star review...but come on staff don't be so gross.Not gross in a clean way but disrespectful, so a slutty girl walks in and leaves and the guys are describing how their dicks feel at the moment \"censored way of putting it\". While a kid if in the store.... So there for a 3 star review is in order..."}
{"text":"Finally open!! Long wongs used to be in this spot. So glad they took over and moved in! Wings are perfect size, haven't had a small wimpy one yet. Flavors and sauces are great. Atl fries are a great side too! So good, went for lunch two days in row. Great wings! Don't pass this spot up!"}
{"text":"Great meaty wings and their fries are good too. Lots of flavor options plus several dry options."}
{"text":"Before trying this place, I did not like wings at all!! But my boyfriend decided to get some wings from here and it changed my entire perspective! The wings are to die for!! I am always satisfied with the flavor and service!"}
{"text":"People have raved about ATL Wings since I moved to Arizona. People said the wings are amazing, delicious, life-changing, just damn-good wings.   But....  I don't think I can use any of those words to describe the food.  I ordered 7 Teriyaki boneless wings. Most people would say that would be a mistake, because boneless are never as good as bone-in. I'll agree somewhat to that, but the sauce itself was decent. My fiance tried several and had a hard time deciding which to choose because he enjoyed all flavors.  The wings were hot and arrived quickly. The fries were a bit...meh, but I'll pass on considering that as part of the review because that is not really why I wanted to try ATL so badly.   What hurt the most was the establishment cleanliness. Maybe it was an off-day, but the room was not clean. The first thing I noticed was the grimy door and floor when I first walked in. Our table was the cleanest one and that's not saying much.  You can watch the cooks in the back, which I really appreciate. But, also it somewhat grossed me out. No one was wearing gloves. I don't know if that is a requirement, but when I can watch what people touch, including their mouths and ears and then I see that utensils and bowls are touched, it just makes for a lost appetite.   My fiance will go back and has no problem with any of the issues I mentioned. Straight up, he will say these are great wings. I am on the fence about it, because I want to make sure my sauce is teriyaki.. and not teriyaki with a hint of ear wax."}
{"text":"Had a manager respond to my first review, instead of apologizing for making me wait 40 minutes just so they could call out the wrong name and give my food away to someone else cause they don't check tickets, they just said I was wrong and it didn't happen.  SERIOUSLY? It's almost comical how bad this restaurant is. Hell's Kitchen just got a new recommendation."}
{"text":"Best place in the valley for wings!!!! But, every time I try to call in an order for pick up, they're busy. I've been on hold for up to 15 minutes!!! WTH?! I love this place, but they forget about the phone. I've shown up while I'm still on hold and they're isn't anyone in the place. I show them how long I've been on hold when I get there and they say that they forgot about the phone. Seriously makes me not want to be a customer. This has happened at their other locations as well. 5 stars normally for flavor, but only 2 for customer service."}
{"text":"man.. this is the THIRD time i've gone ATL Wings and everytime it just gets better and better my god. today i went for a 10pc 1/2 medium and 1/2 honey bbq which was scrumptious as all hell. i had some blue koolaid and i'm telling you i was an all time high in life.. or so i thought. i decided to do me the best favor any person could ever do for themselves and ordered a 2pc honest biscuit dessert... FLAME. like i could've died right then and there and had been okay with my last moment spent eating one of those biscuits. btw the staff is always friendly and one of them even wore a Raiders hat which clearly means they hire good smart people. anyways 10/5 stars good lord ATL Wings well done"}
{"text":"Love the lemon pepper and honey habanero, the sweet honey biscuits are perfect when warm, my favorite place for a cheap but good batch of wings. The staff is friendly, the ambience is not so great but most of the time your too busy licking the sauce off of your fingers!"}
{"text":"ATL wings is a popular spot for well flavored wings and is well up against the wing giant wing stop, the things that make ATL wings stand out is its seasoned fries as well as being able to mix flavors per your request versus wing stop. I requested an order of Hot Lemon Pepper wings and they were batched up with no problem. The staff is always smiling and to get 24 wings the price isn't bad. When I'm in for a craving from the tin of flavors on the menu, or just for a cup of sweet kool aid this will be my ultimate go to place!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for good wing joint. One of my friends recommended ATL. I was near one on a Friday night and decided to stop in and try them out.  I like to take in the complete experience of a restaurant.  I really like the fact that it is a no frills place and their totally speciality are their wing offerings. Keep it small and do what you do best is what I felt when I came in. To that end, when you have a small popular spot you need fast, efficient, and good customer service at the front of the house. Upon ordering my wings the person taking my order seemed totally disinterested in being there. She was not friendly at all. Ok people have bad days. I get that. The wait for my order wasn't that long but they couldn't get a simple order of 10 barbecue wings right. They called my name and gave me someone else's order. Then they called me and again gave me someone else's order. On the third try finally I get my wings with a handful of fries in the bag. I didn't order fries. The wings were delicious but someone really needs to monitor the orders going to customers and whatever you do please have a happy face taking the orders. It really does help with the overall experience..."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill sadly.  A lot of the items we used to order are no longer on the menu.  They say the reason they are gone is because they are trying to franchise the place out and make it simpler.  In my mind that means they are cheapening it up.    The last few times they quoted us a time and it's always 30 minutes after the quote time.  My wife picked the food up tonight.  We were quoted 10 minutes.  She texted me 40 minutes after I called the food in and said she is still waiting.  One of the flavor of wings we ordered were incorrect as well.    Bottom line, if they don't shape up their customer service, they will never make it to a franchise.  I can't control their menu but the things we used to love are no longer available.  ATL wings are no longer the place we order food anymore."}
{"text":"Cashier was nice and answered my question on what flavor is the most popular. The ATL Style dry rub is the most popular so I ordered 6 traditional wings in that style. I also ordered 6 traditional medium Red Hot wings and Cajun style fries. The Cajun style fries were recommended by the cashier. They were delicious! The ATL dry rub was fantastic! The Red Hot medium was spicier than the usual medium buffalo restaurant serve and the vinegar was too strong for me but I still liked them. The chicken is fried very well. They have Pepsi and Dr Pepper along with Kool-Aid and iced tea. This place is NOW my chicken wing spot. Sorry Buffalo Wild Wings and Native Grill!"}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN the best wings in the Phoenix area!  No other place compares so if you want the best chicken wings come here.  Catfish and the owner's grandma coleslaw recipe are amazing as well.  Expect the service to be slow but they take care of you and it is well worth the wait.  There is no comparison for the best wings in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"After driving past this place so many times and reading all the great reviews, I figured it was time to try this place because I love, love, love wings. So I placed an order for pickup after work. First, the girl who took my order was talking to and laughing with someone she was with while I was trying to give her my order.. she said it was her co worker.. Anyway, I ordered 12 traditional wings, hot. Picked up the order, in a wrapped up brown paper bag and drove home. Opened the bag.. Not what I ordered. They were Parmesan garlic if I had to guess. They were fine tasting for what they were, I just don't prefer Parmesan garlic wings, which is why I ordered hot. I was severely disappointed and my hot wing craving went unfulfilled."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Wing Spot. You have awesome customer service. I personally think that they're dry rubs are better than everything else I always eat the spicy ATL and I am never disappointed. They're cool it is also very good I've had cool and at other places and it doesn't come here to the flavor of theirs"}
{"text":"Live the spicy atl wings. I get it litterly every single time. Yess they are that damn good!"}
{"text":"My fiance went and ordered food for us today for the superbowl. I know it is extremely busy for them, and very demanding for the fact that its a superbowl. I was eating my wings and found a BEE deep fried into the chicken leg. I tried to call them at 4:50pm today but no one would answer than someone hung up on me when i called back. I have been eating here for over a year and will never eat here again. This is so disgusting. I would have felt better if i could talk to someone there about it, but that did not happen. Disgusting. So disappointed because I really loved this place."}
{"text":"Wings were awesome. Medium size not to small and not disgustingly huge. The wings are a little on the spicier side. I had the medium which felt like hot and the habanero wings which were sweet and spicy.  My mouth was burning but they are delicious. I recommend  getting some kool ade to help with the heat.  It gets packed on Tuesday because of there .65 cent wings special. However the wait was worth it"}
{"text":"These are the best wings that I've ever had and I've had alot of wings because it's one of my favorite foods! My favorite is the lemon pepper."}
{"text":"I give these wings a 3 stars, just because they constantly mess up my order, and their wings are too small. I have given them a few tries.   Both bone in and boneless wings are VERY small, so, order more than you usually eat (they can be a bit pricey too).  Wing Sauce variety is good! My favorite has to be the Chef's special, some combination of ranch and hot sauce, pretty amazing! I wish the wings were a bit saucier thou.  They make their own ranch/blue cheese, I'm a big ranch fan, and I do NOT like their ranch at all, too thick and NO flavor. Plus, they don't give you enough. C'mon! It's a wing place!  Pretty much, the wing sauce variety is what makes this place EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"We love our wings and have tried just about everywhere in the East Valley. Our search ended with ATL Wings!! We have been ordering wings from ATL for about a year now and have enjoyed every delicious wing. We have tried several of their recipes and our favorites are the Garlic Parm, the ATL style and the Sweet & Tangy. My hubby has always ordered his wings \"naked\"  with sauce on the side because he \"likes to taste the chicken, not just the sauce\", until he tried my wings from ATL. The wings are always perfectly cooked, nice and crispy. And for people like my hubby, the dry rub flavors are a perfect choice! While we have never dined-in, when placing our order the service over the phone is always pleasant and helpful and when picking up our order the service in person is more of the same. The place is small and isn't easily found as it is in a very small strip mall. The establishment has always been clean and busy when I have been there and the food has always been ready and hot when I arrive. I have told several people about this place and they have all agreed with me.....For anyone craving truly yummy chicken wings, ATL is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavor!  The chick who ran the register recommended flavors (Spicy ATL and Chef's Special)and she was dead on for our tastes. Even the fries are good. Cheesy and ATL style. So good! How can you not Ive a place who has Kool-Aid on tap? Best wing place ever!"}
{"text":"AmaZing Wings when the got they order right after the 3rd time. Bad attitudes from all the girls that work there.    Fixed my order for the second time but once again, major attitude for their mistake. I suggest the lemon pepper wings. So good."}
{"text":"A huge selection of flavors. I love how the wings are crispy! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Visited this location last week in the evening. We ordered 10 of the dry rub ATL style wings and 10 of the honey habanero wings (One 10 piece was $9.75). The customer service was amazing. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and our food came out very quick but was also extremely fresh. The wings were big and tasty. They were not greedy with the ranch on the side either which was greatly appreciated. Also tried the cool-aid flavors (blueberry, grape, and fruit punch) because it had been years since last time I had had some. The to-go containers are left out for customers and the staff even had filled up some ketchup cups with lids to go. The store was extremely clean as well. I think I'm in love with ATL Wings."}
{"text":"I will keep this short!  Nice crisp wings. Cooked to perfection. They have dry rubs....yay!  They have BBQ. They have hot wings.  They have other sides. They have all kinds of choices. Had the signature ATL spicy rub. It had a nice spice. Did not quite burn the mouth but it worked nicely. Ordered the garlic. Nice.  Ordered a chipotle BBQ. Good. Wings did not get soggy. Yay. Staff was great. The interior reminded me a little of Wingstop."}
{"text":"Tried out garlic parm wings, mild wings, fries, and the biscuits for our first time here. The wings and fries were really good, but the biscuits are what we will definitely be returning for, they were so delicious! Deep fried ooey gooey goodness that's for sure!!"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite wing place ever in this world. I bring all my friends and family here I bring them and it never disappoints. I get the traditional wings and the seasoned fries which are bomb. They also have kool aid which makes it a little different than most wing places. The honey biscuits are also to die for they are like a Elife of heaven melting in your mouth. HIGHLY SUGGEST"}
{"text":"I usually go to wing stop or zipps for wings! But I never had wings like ATL. Their wings are delicious and crunchy! Every sauce is great! My favorite sauce they have is the house sauce ATL rub! You must need to try it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love these wings!! This place made wings my favorite food. I definitely recommend this place for wing cravings! Their ATL wings with ranch and fries will not steer you wrong. Their customer service is super nice and friendly. They do a really good job keeping the resturant clean! 100% recommend!! If I could give them 10 stars, I would."}
{"text":"This is my first time at ALT. The wife and I stopped in for lunch cause we are always looking for good places to get a bite.  When we walked in the place was slow and we thought what did we get ourself into.  As we approach the counter, we were greeted by a young lady with a smile on her face.  We told her that this was our first time there and what did she recommended.  I told her that I like flavor but not stuff that would come out burning.  She recommended  2 or 3 different flavors from each type (dry rub, bbq, and sauce) the wife asked if she was allowed to mix ranch dry rub and a sauce and they were more than happy to set it up that way.  I tried a sauce that was recommended.  The gal asked if I wanted frys. And I said what kind.  They have normal and seasond Fry's.  I ask if they could be cooked longer to get the chrisp and Bam she set it up that way.  When they came out they were hot and good to go.  At this time the place filled up so I'm guessing we got there just in time.   The wings were full of flavor and not skimpy on the meat on the bones.  The Fry's were awesome and did not need no dipping sauce and 1 order if Fry's is big.  Here is the big kicker.  We had coolaid as out drink right on tap.  All I'm all we are very impressed with the service and food here.  I will be back when I come back into the area."}
{"text":"Ate here for the rest 1st time, 7-15-16. I had their traditional wing ATL style, an order of their biscuits and a free drink(red kool-aid).  If u order any side, u get the drink for free, great deal.  The food was outstanding.  Their wings are tops, delicious biscuits.  It's a dessert biscuit, syrup & powdered sugar, goes perfect with chicken.  The wings are naked and very crisp and the meat is oh so tender.  No black veins in the chicken like alot of places.  They are good size wings.  The 2 front girls are cute and very friendly and helpful.  They even have a loyalty card program, after 10 stamps, u get a free 10 piece wing.  The inside is small but cozy.  They have a few tables outside.  ALL in all, a great place.  The wings I would have to say are the best I've ever had.  I want to eventually try the other sauces and dry rubs.  They have a ton."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service. Everybody looks angry and/or stoned, bad attitudes. They act like you are inconveniencing them when you order food. You get better customer service at the DMV and the cable company than this place. Their boneless wings are made with that cheap ground up chicken blubber product you see in mcdonalds chicken nuggets. for the price, definitely worth it. Bone in wings and sauces are good, but everything else cancels most of it out. That is the only thing that earned them an extra star."}
{"text":"Really good wings served in a very fast food manner at a very non-fast food price.   The dry rubs were def the best, the Garlic Parmesan to be specific was our favorite.  The ATL rub wings were super super salty.  The Extreme Habanero were really tasty and not too spicy at all  The Chipotle Lime wings were extremely sweet and were the most similar to BWW type wings. Loaded with syrup which I don't care for.   Best wings in town? Nope. Good though. I'd go back for the Garlic Parmesan wings. Skip the super soggy fries."}
{"text":"My family and I come here all the time and to get a salad that costs 9.50, damn near 10 dollars after tax to get lettuce, cheese, a side of grated carrots, and some meat with some dressing is not worth it. The wings are great but not the salads."}
{"text":"Thought I reviewed this place... But they are my #1 goto place for wings... They beat out Long Wongs finally... Well LW changed their process and its not as good anymore..   Wings, FRIED, yes FRIED.... n thats they way i love them.. Cooked perfect every time, even the really FATTER pieces were cooked all the way... Now for the GREATness is that LW's has the BEST Ranch,, but guess what,,, the 2 places have almost the Exact same Ranch and they are great... would need to try them side by side ot see if there was any real differences though..   We always get takeout btw... the dining area seems a lil run down,, just not feelin it.. :p..."}
{"text":"These wings are the best!  I've become a wing snob in the last year and I was so happy to find this place.  I don't even try looking elsewhere anymore....really every flavor I've had so far has it's own unique taste, and every single one I've tried has been great!"}
{"text":"Everyone rates pretty high...and they are right on. The negative reviewers are I think looking for something else. One was whining about Fried food. Hello...it's a wing joint! The other negative review was similar...so it is what it is! A Fantastic Place for WINGS with Flavors coming to please nearly every Tongue!!!  We have been here three times. Not nearly enough but unfortunately we just don't plan for enough time. Yes they cook to order and that takes a while! Doesn't it take a while when you cook your dinner at home!??? Seee? Now lets hear no more whining about how long it takes!  First time here I had the Chicken Fingers but had them add Hot Wing sauce. They asked did I want to dip them myself...NOPE...I want them coated just like the wings! That was NO prob! The family wanted an assortment of different wing flavs...another fam member just wanted a plain chicken sammy. All food Yummmmy!  When we were finishing up they came out and asked how our food was and if we had heard about their \"biscuits?\" Ummm....NO. They brought us these hot gooey bites with powdered sugar and honey. I would not call this a biscuit...it's more like something between a scone and a beneit. They are amazing...just don't burn your mouth...!   Anyhow the next time we ate here I had the Tilapia and Shrimp...OMG was this wonderful. Perfectly cooked fish and Shrimp...the Shrimp were HUGE...like bigger than my thumb and the Tilapia was flavorful and flakey. The seasoning was a blackened/cajun flavor that was not overpowering. The coleslaw I had was perfect. Flavor awesome...not to wet or dry.   My family loves the Kool aid option. I have no idea why. Personally I can't stand the stuff. But you can drink all ya like. I like the 20oz soda option and bottled water selection.  Side dishes here are varied from fried okra to fried mac n cheese and more. Their menu is pretty varied actually. But as the other reviewers say...either order ahead and eat in or take it home with you. They really do cook from scratch.  The staff is sooo friendly...helpful...and very educated about their product! They don't Just Work There! They Know what they are doing.  Oh and be sure to download their APP for your phone. It contains a punchcard ! So every visit they electronically mark your visit and after 10 you get free food! You can order from your phone and they text your with deals. Believe it or not I just as I'm typing got the Tuesday Deal of the DaY..right NOW! LOL...great timing!  Go Eat ! All you have to lose is the money in your wallet time and time again cos you will go back time and time again! And take your friends cos they will LOVE you for taking them there!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The wings were made perfectly. We enjoyed every moment. Great and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Bomb ass wings! Yummy ATL style fries and free refills on drinks? Ftw! So glad we came here today! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile and the cashier kindly explained the specials and all the popular flavors. I ordered the honey habanero and garlic Parmesan wings with. Side of ATL style fries and Mac n cheese bites! Finger lickin' good! Will definitely come back here to try the other flavors, but def more of the honey habanero! Also if you join the text club you get 60 cent wings ever Tuesday! Yay! :-)"}
{"text":"I've passed this place since it opened, assuming it was just the latest crappy franchise wing place to pop up.   That was dumb. I didn't know it was humanly possible to find wings this good anymore. Perfect crispy outside, perfect moist and tender inside, and your choice of over a dozen sauces ranging from the common to the unexpected. If you're anywhere near ATL Wings, go and get some awesome wings.   Tony Bourdain would appreciate their mastery of the fryolated arts. Wings? Awesome. Fried okra? Fantastic. Every other fried thing I've tried? Good to great. The celery served with the wings is pretty sad, but I don't personally buy wings for the vegetables."}
{"text":"Yes! I am all about this place!! Now it is definitely a hole in the wall ambience with dim lighting and shakey tables, however their wings are on point!  Tons of flavors to choose from to adorn your thick meaty chicken wings. Now there isn't much else to their menu so don't venture here with the intent of wings not being your main dish. HOWEVER the fries were bomb.com. Seriously! ! So tasty with their special seasoning. I would come back just for the fries."}
{"text":"I have never ate wings 5 days in a row this place is honestly amazing the food is great the staff is very friendly once u go there acouple times they remember your name very friendly this is honestly one of the best places for wings"}
{"text":"Sunday letdown...I had been craving ATL Wings all week so we ordered them for football snacks.   We ordered 36 ATL style which we have gotten multiple times in the past.   The wings we got today were not the usual ATL style that we always get;  they were HOT...spicy hot.   I could only eat 2 and the kids would not eat them so I call ATL to let them know and I get \"are you sure you got them from this location? \"  I told the girl my name so she could confirm that we got the wings there and told her that we couldn't eat them and wanted to know if they changed the recipe; she said no and sorry.   Sorry?  How about some customer service? I just wasted $38 and  I am so disappointed!"}
{"text":"The stars are only for the food/cook! That is the only reason I come back. They never answer the phone for take out or put you on hold and never come back, the girl this time didn't know what she was doing on the cash register and forgot my buffalo chicken salad and the manager or who I assume was the manager was not friendly or polite and didn't even apologize for the mistake. Can I get a free drink dang....  But the cook makes bomb wings and fast so here I am....lol. Oh And the dishwasher I think opened the door for me when I left so that was nice :)"}
{"text":"4 words: ORDER THE ATL WINGS! Whether you get them spicy or regular, get the ATL wings. Trust me"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here a few times and it's always good. Yes you have to wait a bit for your food, but it comes out pipping hot!  Honey habanero is our fav sauce. Sweet with a kick to it. Their fries are yummy too. Make sure to get them ATL style. Oh! And they have Kool aid on tap! Yes! On tap! Lol"}
{"text":"We frequent the (AZ) Ave location and decided to try this one a try. The layout is weird. Kind of like a maze how it has two separate dining areas. I don't know why but the area where the drink machine was seemed super hot. I think the kitchen was right off that area. But not sure.  Wings were hot, crispy, and tasty. Everything was good. It threw me off when I asked the girl if we got a free soda since we ordered the ATL fries with our 18 wings, and she said \"not today\"?  But other than that, the girls were nice. Food came out fast and it was clean."}
{"text":"Shit was good, but kinda pricey. 14 bucks for 10 wings, Kool-aid, and fried Okra. For 14 bones, I can quench the thirst of a decent sized village in Africa with Kool-Aid. Employees were very cool, and made suggestions, which I love. I got good vibes from ATL Wings, and will be back-"}
{"text":"ATL is easily on its way towards a Best of Phoenix issue....seriously good wings.  I have tried lots of different wings from around the city thanks to my bf who is always on the hunt for the best wings. Atl easily just jumped to the top of our go to list. We went with Seasoned, Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan. A-H-H-Mazzzing. Fried hard and crisp and seasoned perfectly. No sauce even required. The quality of the chicken is great and you can taste it also there is nothing puny about these wings either.  Kool-Aid on tap and lots of other menu options like fish, chicken fingers, okra, mac n cheese, honey biscuits with honey and powdered sugar etc..  GO here and fall in love, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"i downloaded yelp just to write this .. this place gave me the worst wings i have ever had. idk if that's the wings they serve all the time or what. i cam in around 11:30AM, just a little after they open so i can't imagine they gave me old wings. anyway they were so crispy, so burnt and had ZERO meat on them. not to mention they gave me what they said was \"ranch\" no .. this wasn't ranch.. this had something hard and when i tasted it i almost vomited. only thing i can applaud them for is their speedy service. other than that .. worst wings i have ever had."}
{"text":"Best Wings in town. This has been my go to place for wings since they opened. Dry rub, BBQ, or Red Hot you can't go wrong. When they are busy they are busy. There are several other wing/pizza places within half a mile. Please go there for average wings and leave the best wings in town place so it's not so busy"}
{"text":"Ordered ahead for some boneless wings.  We had a beer and walked over.  Waited in line,  which was slow.  People behind me gave up and left.  I finally paid and got a soda.I took one sip of the soda and threw it in the garbage.  Flat and syrupy.  Finally,  35 minutes after ordering, our food was ready.  The wings are edible but below average.  Even if the service were good I wouldn't go back.  No food poisoning so two stars."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I have ever had. Definately in the top 3. The wings always have a great crunch to them and the atl style is delicious! Service is excelent!"}
{"text":"ALL THE LOVE. The name says it all. I've spoken with so many wing lovers about this place and we all agree, this is the best wing spot in town.   Their menu is strictly wings, you either get your boneless or your regular wing. They have sides available like fries and salad but the menu doesn't get much bigger than that which is why I find ATL the best wing spot. They truly specialize in wings.   Now is the fun part...the flavors for your wings. SO MANY FLAVORS. The best part is...say you order 18 wings, they let you break it down into multiple flavors. That's my go-to with my boyfriend. 18 wings, 3 different flavors. It breaks down nicely. I'm still working my way through their flavor list but I'm a huge fan of the dry rubs. They are just easier to eat without having to go through an entire package of napkins. The ATL rub is an easy choice. It's their signature rub and it's mild and delicious. The medium sauce is spicier than I was expecting so next time I would probably go mild. I could go on and on about the flavors I've tried but I really haven't had one that I've disliked so far so any sauce is a safe bet!! Try them out yourself, you'll quickly be heading back to try more.  I usually get a side salad instead of fries to not make myself feel so bad about eating so many wings and to be honest, their simple side salad is super yummy! They have a house dressing I highly recommend getting. They also have Fruit Punch dispensers next to their soft drink dispenser. You like grape punch? You got it. Not quite sure the exact name of the flavors but they have blue & red too.   Lastly, I love their staff. I usually call in and order over the phone and they are the nicest people every time. Then when I go in to pick up my food, they're always smiling and friendly, striking up conversation and making you feel the love."}
{"text":"My co worker invited me   my first time and the wings fries and kool aid was quite good.  and not that expensive at all  Recommend Atl"}
{"text":"I have to say the wings are good, the pricing isn't. On Tuesday it's .65 wings which is a little cheaper than normal but if you get fries and a drink it's a couple dollars more than if you bought a combo any other day of the week. Tuesday is supposed to be a sale on wings but it's actually the day they can make more money on not so money savvy customers."}
{"text":"LOVE their wings!!   Cannot beat their ATL style.  We have tried most of the flavors, but always get the bulk in ATL style.  Employees always are friendly, and actually look like they are having a good time.  As an added bonus, they have 75 cent wings on Tuesday. Just know the line can be long, but worth the wait.  Also, if you really enjoy wings, check out the wing festivals in Chandler and Mesa.  ATL can be found there, too"}
{"text":"Pleasently surprised with how flavorful and perfectly crisp these wings are! So excited to have a new favorite Wing joint in the neighborhood. Only reason I docked a star was for the innacurate to-go time. They said 20 mins on the phone. Got there at 20 mins and waited at least another 15-20 mins for my order."}
{"text":"\" dayum gina\" \"finger-lickin good\" \"OMG\"  These don't even begin to describe the food here. Lemme start with the menu: I posted a photo for all to see but you have at least 15-18 different flavors to choose from between seasonings and sauces, oodles of sides from fries, fried okra, Mac and cheese bites, corn bites aka hush puppies, etc etc etc.  For drinks they have soda, tea and (drumroll please) KOOL AID!!!  Oh yes my friends I said it.  So now that I've briefed you, lemme tell you what we got.  Wings of course. The best flavor to tantalize my tongue so far....  LEMON PEPPER! Oh yes- seasoned perfectly, crunchy in all the right places.  I also tried the garlic parmesan and seasoned flavors as well. Very good but you see the LP got my #1 vote   We also got a side of fries which were good too!  Now for my last item of review you must excuse my profanity   But the Honey Biscuits were orgasmic!  Think beignet/donut drizzled in honey and sprinkled with powder sugar.  Hot damn, next time im feeling lonely, ATL wings just prepare me an order of your honey love!  You won't be disappointed!  Like they say at the restaurants:  Good food takes time. We aren't slow, your just impatient!  Hahahah hell yea I'm ready for these wingz"}
{"text":"I don't like complaining but I have to here... I even opened a yelp account for this review.   I've gone into ATL wings in Chandler a couple times and each time the customer service is terrible. The owner is rude, insincere, andalways looks angry, even according to friends that have been there on their own. The wings are good but the customer service is lousy. Anyone who works in customer service knows that if you get an order wrong, don't act like it's your customers fault, especially when said customer is super nice about it. Mistakes happen, no problem. That's normal... But don't be a jerk about it. And heaven forbid you ask a question... They act like you're an idiot and as though it's an insult to them for even asking!  If you want a place to simply take your order and provide tasty wings, this is the place, which is why they get a couple stars. But if you want an enjoyable experience, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been seeing my friends check-ins to this place and have always wanted to try it. I went with my friend Monica and ordered 10 wings; lemon pepper and the other half were hot with some sweet tea. The sweet tea was way too sweet so I'm assuming the kool aid is also, yes they have kool aid!! I usually get my wings from long wongs which only takes cash so it can be a pain. I loved this place!!!  Loved that even though I only ordered 10 wings I could do split flavors , and they were crispy wings and great flavor. I wish there was a location here in tempe so I can go here for lunch"}
{"text":"Amazing wings, rude service.  They literally answer the phone and say, \"ATL, please hold\" but Instead of putting you on hold they put the phone down and forget about it. I get that if you have  a line going out the door to take care of them first, but don't make people hold if you don't intend to answer the phone. Just don't accept call ins...."}
{"text":"Great wings, definitely try the ATL sauce it is delicious along with the honey habanero.  I would call ahead as the line is always long because of how good the wings are."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in town! I always get medium but I've tried other flavors and they are all really good!"}
{"text":"ATL wings are by far the best wings in the valley.  My favorite being atl rub wings with atl fries and of course fruit punch koolaid.  It's dangerous that this place is so close to home. It's definitely worth the wait when it's busy."}
{"text":"if you haven't been to this damn place you are missing out! best wings i've ever had in my entire life! amazing! super clean... staff super friendly!!! it doesn't get better than this. mark my words!"}
{"text":"You can taste All The Love in every single wing. The variety of sauces will potentially leave you feelin lost in the sauce... it's okay to get lost in these sauces though. The dry rubs are also delicious, and you can't forget the fries. I've been pleased every time I visit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for chicken wings. The ATL style wings are my go to, it is a flavorful dry rub and the skin is crispy.  They have many different wing sauce flavors including the traditional buffalo style. They serve the wings with a side of cold ranch or blue cheese. They also serve Kool-aid, which takes me back to my childhood."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS IN TOWN!! Recently discovered this place and so glad I did! My boyfriend is a wing connoisseur so when he said this was the best place to get wings, I had to check it out! The girls are always super nice and cute. Love their New York accents! Fries are bomb. They even have kool-aid!!! Music is always on point. This place is by far my favorite wing spot"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in the portion size they offer. We ordered 18 boneless wings in 3 flavors. The flavors weren't divided evenly, and came in two sets of 7 and a set of 5. We paid almost $25 for 18 boneless wings and two of these small honey biscuit things which were supposed to be covered in powdered sugar yet had no significant amount included. They have a sign that says \"it's all about the sauce\". Apparently so. I would recommend buying the sauce from them and making your own wings at home. And honestly, the flavor wasn't that incredible either. I could go to Buffalo Wild Wings and get the same amount of food for about half the price. I was told this place was good, and I had to try it, but I'm disappointed. Management should seriously consider increasing the portion sizes they offer to become relevant in the competitive market. If they so choose to make it up to me then so be it. Otherwise I will not come again and do not recommend this wing place."}
{"text":"Best... Wings... Ever!!!   The first time I tried this place was at wing stock last year and it was amazing. I'm so glad it's close to my house!! I've tried almost all of their favors and everything is amazing. My favorite is the garlic Parmesan and their atl style. The lemon pepper is also really good. I usually get full after half a dozen. And don't forget to wash it down with some kool aid!!   Everyone is really friendly and the service is pretty quick. They get really packed on the weekends around lunch time though. It's worth the wait though. You won't be disappointed!! =)"}
{"text":"Great wings and really good friendly staff. This place never gets old. Usually go there once a week."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. I will go back definitely !!  The wings were very tasty and the service was pretty quick. I also like the fact that this location is close to my house too. So that's a plus.   Now, their french fries need to go !! I don't know if it was just the times I went, but my goodness !! the fries were cut to thin & tiny almost like the size of toothpicks. Very hard to enjoy dipping them in the ranch sauce. Damn near had to use a fork lmao."}
{"text":"We won't come back. Not impressed. The wings were hard, tough and dry. Ordered a 24 piece and was given two small dipping sauces. When I asked for two more they wanted to charge for them even though you should get one for every six piece. Probably a great college hangout but for the working class no bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Cianna was just a sweetheart from start to finish. Best wings around. Fast and fresh.  Even gave me a sample wing of the sauce I wanted to try!"}
{"text":"Decent wings.   Kudos for having koolaid. The mirrors on the wall throws me off - makes me think the location is bigger than it is.  I had three flavors and my favorite was garlic parmesan. Yummmmmmmm. The seasoned wings were okay and the honey haberno has a slight kick but not very spicy.  The online menu differs from the prices on the board. Prices are reasonable overall. When I had my wings, they were cold. I got lost coming to the place (I had a phone order placed).   A good place to go to if you want some wings - reasonably priced and the flavors aren't too bland and the wings aren't extremely small or anything. They have meat.   It comes with some celery on the side so you don't feel as guilty if you're eating wings (unless you're on Atkins diet then eat all the wings you want and throw out the veggies!)."}
{"text":"Thee best place to get wings in Az. I no longer eat meat but I love bringing my family members here for some chicken!"}
{"text":"The wings and fries are good. But didn't care for my sauce on my wings, I got the chef's special and it was nothing special."}
{"text":"Changed up my wing selection this week to the Extreme Honey Habenaro....let's just say that this is my new favorite.  It is spicier with a touch of honey...definately worth a try if you are willing to mix it up.  Move over Lucky Sweet Reds, mamas gotta a new favorite :)"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Veronica is seriously one of the sweetest people. Terrin is super sweet too and she really takes care of everyone who comes in. Thanks to them for being an awesome team!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We've ordered from here a few times and the wings aren't  too bad. However this time we get it to go and get home and guess what? NO RANCH. What's the point of going over my order and telling me what I have in my order If you're not going to place everything in my to go order. Didn't notice till we home of course. Mad and irritated because for one it's late and I don't want to drive back as I shouldn't have to. Employees  should do a better job at their job to keep the business going. Not to mention the fries we got were prob reheated a couple times."}
{"text":"Great food, but rude service every time. Zero customer service, they treat you like they're doing you a favor. You're a paying customer... Pretty shocking. Will try other locations for this chain because the wings are great!"}
{"text":"This place has good food, but their service is HORRIBLE!!!! they messed up my order 3 times. I was there for over an hour and a half and when I came home, my food was cold and the order was messed up for the 4th and final time. It's to bad their service SUCKED because my house eats wing at least once a week. Also, the manager and girl/child that were working were RUDE and blamed us for messing up the order."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to dine! Really relaxed environment with a great selection of wings! Plus there's Kool Aid which is always a good thing. Service is great a prices are very reasonable. I don't have a bad thing to say. I'm just ready to try all of the other flavors!"}
{"text":"By far mine and my family's favorite place for wings! So many different varieties and their seasoned fries are so good! My only complaint is the restaurant is a little small so it hard to go with a big group."}
{"text":"I found this nice little wing place in a easy to find spot location. It was my first visit to this restaurant so I was looking up at the menu for a little bit to figure out what I wanted to order. There was a wide variety of wing sauces. I was unfamiliar with their ATL wing flavor and the cashier was very nice and offered me a sample.   I ordered the ATL syle, Honey Habanero, and Hot wings with a side of salad. All the flavors were delicious."}
{"text":"Being in the military, I have the opportunity to travel and visit many places and many places I have visited. Wings are my favorite food so naturally I am always on the hunt for the best. I've been here in the East Valley for almost three years and I just happen to have found two places here that are in my top 5. ATL Wings and Uncle Bears.   ATL Wings is #1 on my list and it's so good that I've waited months just to get a shirt. The ribs / sauces are great and my favorite is ATL and Cajun BBQ. If you are in the military, this location (Warner) offers a discount. I've ate at the location in Tempe and in Phoenix and this one they are more friendly.  I'm moving to New England in a few weeks and am doubtful that I'll find a place to beat ATL!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is very good. The wings are crispy the way I like and you get more than enough fries. It's the customer services that's bad. Every time I've been there the cashiers seem like they don't want to be there. This last weekend the two young girls working the front were complaining about the customers that came in after us. They were complaining that they better not be dine in because they have things to do. That they don't want to be stuck at work after 9pm. This was around 8pm. A young guy came out from the back cussing left and right in front of all the customers and complaining they  better have Easter off. This went on for several minutes before the manager came out to tell all 3 something. Very unprofessional staff that need to be retrained or let go."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in AZ and I can say that with confidence!! The ATL dry rub is an absolute must, my other personal fave is the Cajun hot. Absolutely delicious. Far better than wing stop. Plus a Kool aid fountain drinks!! What more can you ask for? A must try for any one who loves them self some wings"}
{"text":"Chicken wangs and Kool-aid on tap.  Yeah girl!  After shopping at Chandler Fashion Center, we decided to grab some wings for take out and ATL Wings was the place to go!  Walking into the modest and slightly warm joint, we were greeted by the nicest cashier ever.  We got to sample some different sauces and we ended up getting the Honey Habanero, Honey Mustard, Garlic Parmesan, and Garlic Pepper wings.  It smelled sooo good and I almost found myself wanting to dine-in!  The car ride home was torture.  The car was fragrance by the smell of some fried chicken wings and as soon as I could drop my purse onto the ottoman and kick off my shoes, I was tearing through that bag like a mad woman.  Huge fatty wings greeted us and I said my hello's by sinking my teeth into a wing dipped in blue cheese sauce.  Bliss.    ATL Wings is a solid wing place and I for sure will be back!  I think I want to try some of their tasty sides next time."}
{"text":"Unreal wings. Choose your adventure. Mediums were good. Cajun were better. Then i had the ATL and the ATL spicey and ohhh holy hell. Loved them. Flavorful dry rubs. Just wonderful. They are a treat."}
{"text":"Horrible take out service. Unless you want to ruin your party, do not cater from here! I called ahead at 11:00 AM for a 4:00 PM pickup for boneless wings. I showed up at 3:50 PM and my order wasn't ready until 4:45 PM. 55 minute wait on a call ahead order and on top of that, my order was wrong because half my wings were traditional wings, not boneless."}
{"text":"I know I'm no the Terminator....but \"I'll be baahck\" I walked in for the first time last week and not sure what to expect.It was Cardinals MNF game and it was on the two flat screens with sound on.  I forget what it took the place of but its between Panda Express and Hawaii Ono. They have another location in Chandler as well. It looks clean inside and it looks like they did a remodel from the last spot. The menu is above the register on LCD's. The cashier (Kendall maybe) was real cool from the minute I walked in and staring at the sign. She gave me a breakdown of the sauces had me try a few of the flavors asked all kinda questions to see what I would like. The girl has got passion for wings! Yes they were a little pricey but these wings were meaty!!..Even the non drumsticks pieces looked like they were on steroids! They have a few dry rub options but that doesnt mean just powder on top ...it just means not tossed in sauce like the other ones. I got Habanero Honey and I think there were two levels. I got the hotter one and it was perfect. Since I walked into a spot called ATL wings I got the ATL dry rub as well.....which wasnt a bad choice but I'll have try another spicy flavor next time . These were just a lil too boring for me. Shoestring fries, drink and 12 wings was 17-18 bucks so a little pricey for this neck of the woods but maybe the Arcadia folk may place enough catering orders to keep these people around."}
{"text":"Oh ' my ALT wings has been moved to the top of the wings list. Oh my lort these wings and fries and service,..And some dam koolaid come on now, I'm sorry but if you don't stop here for your next order of wings,, then you just missing out I had the ALT style bone in they awesome and ATL fries. the two men in the back cooking are WINGGENIOUSES that's rite I made up a word cause that's how good it is...Don't pass this up. I did for about 4 years and today I decided to stop and  they gained a customer for life.. Keep up the good work fam... I'm the owner of Trash Boss Hauling and I approve this message......"}
{"text":"Food is always on point !! But the service is lately is  so bad!!! People yelling in  back  and yelling at people . And no dinning in cause their closing in  30mins  and all the chairs put away!!"}
{"text":"Went back and took my parents. I absolutely love this place, and my parents consider themselves wing condisouers. I have taken them to several places and each time critiquing each place. We got to atl wings and they got the Cajun hot wings and I got old school atl style rub. My parents loved it! They loved the fact it wasn't super sloppy and the loved the flavor. I let them try mine and they also loved those. Usually they try to tell me where else are we trying next time.. Instead they said when are we coming back here. After lunch I got some biscuits and again phenomenal! I'm on a low carb diet and I couldn't resist having one! This place is the bomb dignity. So yourself a favor and try this place. I've even told my wife once I was going to take her somewhere fancy for date night and brought here to Atl. She gave me a look, but appreciated because it was her first time trying Atl!"}
{"text":"I never really take the time to write a review but this deserved one....I've been going to ATL for years ever since they opened in Chandler my home town. They've always been down to earth and make the best wings! Yesterday I went to the Mesa location and there was a homeless dude outside sleeping. One of the cooks came out and asked him politely to wake up and leave and offered him some water before he goes. The guy said yes and the cook came out with a water bottle and some wings. Thought that was the coolest thing ever, he could have just said leave but he had the kindness in his heart to do a little more. ALL THE LOVE to you guys!"}
{"text":"we came in and ordered take out on a week night because we didn't feel like cooking. the boyfriend \"doesn't like\" wings (i don't know why i'm dating him either) but i showed him the menu and convinced him it would be delicious. we were not disappointed! i ordered 6 honey habanero and 6 parmesan garlic and my fella ordered 10 of the ATL style boneless wings and we split an order of fries. everything was really good! we thoroughly enjoyed it all and since i over ordered (who was i kidding thinking i could eat a dozen wings), i got to eat it all over again for lunch the next day. the staff was friendly and even on a wednesday night, there were quite a few other patrons; mostly families with younger kids. there is definitely something here for everyone!"}
{"text":"Best wing in Phoenix. The dry rubs are great and the homemade blue cheese is awesome! They serve kool-aid!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great wings in all sorts of fun flavors and crispy-fried deliciousness. Their ATL fries are awesome - a bit spicy, but everything is a bit spicy here. The counter service is always quick and efficient - and super friendly too. My favorite are the citrus chipotle and the garlic parmesan. YUM."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some wings and fries with the family. We were greeted the minute we walked in and helped in making our decision. We were also given a sample to help make our decision. I must say, the wings were phenomenal. Crispy, juicy and the sauces were made well. We eat at a lot of wing places and this is our new favorite. Def, a place we will becoming to."}
{"text":"This place is lucky they have great wings. Their service is quick, but horrible! If you're one who cares about how staff treats you, you will walk out of this place stressed almost every time. I continue to order because they do have great sauces and are less than a mile from my home. I just try to speak to the staff as little as possible to avoid a stressful experience. My recommendation to the restaurant, teach your staff the value of great customer service. Sometimes great service is what makes a company superior than others...you already have AMAZING wings, think of how you can gain repeat customers/retain your customers by adding that little bit extra. A smile, an extra upbeat attitude can make the world of a difference, even for your employees! MAKE it fun for you & your guests. PLEASE!"}
{"text":"My friend was in town and had this place on his place of \"to-eats\". Luckily I was craving wings and was down to try it as well. Their five stars was earned right at the door when the cashier immediately greeted us with her friendly demeanor followed by her quick recommendations.  She and another employee asked us what were looking for and were quick with sauce recommendations. They even provided us with a wing sample!  Anyways we walked out with a bunch of different flavors and were happy with all of them. The chicken was juicy and the sauce/rubs were perfect compliments to how it was cooked.  Can't wait to come back in and try out all the other flavors I didn't get to."}
{"text":"I love the wings and kool aid here! Get the ATL style dry rub and the grape kool aid! Sooooo good! You definitely may need a Lipitor when you leave especially if you get fries too but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"I have hesitated coming in here, thinking the previous joint (Long Wong's) had just rebranded, but happily I decided to check it out and ATL is NOTHING like the previous wing joint. Very nice employees, manager was super nice talking about how they are different. They offered me 2 different wings to try and they were both awesome!!! ATL, you have earned my business!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was courteous, the building was clean, the Wings are awesome, music was good also! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Okay, soooo.. if you looked at their menu and thought the shrimp dinner, the pork tenderloin sandwich, the corn fritter things, or any of the other specials on the sign they hang out front looked good, don't bother. I feel like every time I go to ATL wings they've retired something new because it \"wasn't selling\" and it's just a bit of a disappointment.  My boyfriend likes their wings. He's addicted. But if you don't like wings - admittedly I'm not a huge fan, but he's so enthusiastic that I don't like saying we shouldn't eat there - just get a salad and hope they haven't retired that, too."}
{"text":"Just like most reviews on here say, these wings are delicious! I have tried about 8 of the flavors, all were great. They Cajun Hot were the best ones out there. The reason a star in lost is because of the customer service there. The cashiers are all nice and friendly. They people in back are always giving the worst looks to the customers. Oh well. It tastes good. A little bit higher on the price scale, but the wind size makes up for it."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me about them and said I had to try them.  The wings are just that perfect crispy but super juicy on the inside and not dry.  I tried to Atl rub which is delicious and citrus Chipotle which was also delicious.  I also had the Atl fries which whatever seasoning they use is superb. Don't think i'ma go to any other wing place again.  This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Atl Wings is by far the best wings in the area, probably in AZ. I've been there several times and taken friends, everyone loves it as well as the fun and engaged staff! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great wings, chef's special is ridiculous it's soooo good! Wings are friend right, but a bit oily so it cost them a star.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in ATL Wings. I am a native Alabamian and the food here was not up to snuff. The waitress seemed to be upset with me as if I had slept with her boyfriend or husband. There was a young man there who was going to provide me with a ranch and she said, \"No, that is going to cost 75 cents.He shrugged his shoulders sorry. I paid the 75 cents. But that was the LAST amount of any money ATL will EVA get from me... and the food was not that good. Blah!"}
{"text":"Was tired of going to same place for wings so decided to give this place a try. I have the 10 of the traditional wings 5of the Cajan BBQ and 5 of the bbq. The cajan bbq were on point! They were a little spicy but well worth it. The kitchen looked a little scary for me to try because I seen the chicken trays on the bottom the tables almost on the floor but that didn't stop me from trying he wings. They were well worth trying recommend trying the bbq Cajan if you like spicy and bbq."}
{"text":"This place seems very popular. Within an hour of dining in, I saw many customers ordering chickens to go. Their prices are relatively affordable and chicken wings have many different flavor that you can choose from.   Their wings are definitely a bit too oily for my taste. I think I'm used to chicken wings that are more chewy versus fried. Also, every bite is covered with oil.   My friends, however, seem to enjoy it very much. I guess it really depends on how you like your chicken wings cooked. This place is probably not for me. But others might found it very tasty."}
{"text":"Atl Wings has a ton going for it. Friendly service, great flavors (the lemon pepper and habanero are both standouts) good prices.  Two issues though....I've ordered there 4 times, and all 4 have had these issues.  To go orders take much longer than quoted on the phone.  One item is always wrong. Always. It's become a joke in our house...which part of the order is going to be wrong?  But the flavors keep us coming back"}
{"text":"We love ATL wings.  I practically live across the street and never even knew about this place till last year.  The wings are excellent and really good price, and the staff is pleasant enough.  BUT 1)  What's with the indoor lighting?  Neon red!  Are we in the Red Light District? Are they trying to save money on normal lighting?  I get a headache after 5 minutes, so I never eat there.  Please invest on lights, or at least natural light. 2) Stop taking things off the menu.  Shrimp, corn fritters..where have you gone? The Ever-Shrinking Menu.  Now all they have is wings."}
{"text":"My Spouse and I were craving wings last Friday and after searching online for the best wings, ATL Wings seemed to be at the top of many people's list. Upon arriving there were about 3 people in front of us yet the line moved pretty quickly. There are a ton of wing packages and flavors to choose from so feel free to mix and match! The wings were crispy and the sauce was applied perfectly. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because there were two containers on the bottom shel of the working space that held wings. The wings were close to the floor and just didn't seem too sanitary."}
