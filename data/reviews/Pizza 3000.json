{"text":"This is quite good pizza at a great price, especially the unlimited toppings pick-up special.  There are four crust thicknesses available, and a wide array of toppings, so it should appeal to almost anyone who likes North American style pizza.  The cheese is put on top, and they don't skimp.  Also, the toppings themselves are pretty good quality, e.g. the olives actually taste like olives, rather than vaguely salty rubber faucet washers like at some pizza joints.I have no reservations recommending this place. I almost gave it four stars, but that would put it in a league with the better Neapolitan style pizza joints in town, and that doesn't seem quite right...maybe these are two different categories altogether really."}
{"text":"We ordered by internet via ''just-eat''. Delivery time was 45 min but we received our order in 30 min. We ordered a meat lover pizza, a veggie pizza, wings (honey garlic sauce) and bread stick. Everything was hot & really good. The veggie pizza was a little spicy but ok for me."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Calgary! 

We used to live by the University so driving by to pick up a delicious Awesome pizza (my fave!) was a no-brainer. Even now that we moved across the city we still get our pizza from there. It's not greesy, not too spicy, always hot and fresh from the oven - it's p.e.r.f.e.c.t. Plus it's really well priced, and the stuff is super friendly! Keep up good work!"}
{"text":"As you arrive at Pizza 3000 the first thing that may arise in your thoughts , is the rather drab and lackluster aesthetic of the  pizzeria.  Remember that old adage your nana and mother had about not judging a book by its cover , Pizza 3000 is one of those cases . What this pizzeria lacks in flash  and style it makes up with some of the finest pizza in the city of Calgary ..... or dare I say Western Canada. When one combines the exquisite pie offered at Pizza 3000 alongside its great value , it emerges as of the city's hidden gems. Pizza 3000 is a lot like New York legend Big L , considered to be one of the greatest musicians of his era but largely unknown to  the greater public. 

PS- do not get the pizza by the slice ."}
{"text":"They have a variety of awesome pizzas I must say!  The people working there are always very friendly. Good people. If you want tasty and not average pizza ..head over there,and hey try their yummy kebabs also. Thumbs up 5/5!"}
{"text":"Pizza 3000 is by far the best pizza for the price!  Whenever I have a lazy, I-don't-want-to-cook, day I order their pizza.

They have a pick-up special, usually I get the XL, unlimited toppings, for $12.99 +tax!!  The inside of this place is very clean, a good thing in my eyes!  No matter when I phone to order, it only takes 20 minutes for the pizza, even when they are super busy!  It shows how well they have this place running.  The pizza is always piping hot and the toppings fresh.  They do also have pizza by the slice, as well as special prices when ordering 2 or more pizzas.  Their other food options, like bread sticks, garlic bread, wings are all decently priced.  They are closed on Mondays.  They are open until 3am on the weekends! 

I will continue to eat their pizza on a weekly basis, it would be a sin not to!  I highly recommend trying this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza 3000 there deals are great and pizza is delicious but if your going to order go down to the Bowness one or call them.

This one is horrible the staff is insensitive, can barley speak English, is always late or gets lost and this winter on a number of occasions I had to walk out across my apartment parking lot to get my pizza the whole point of delivery is door service.

It was always cold, or hard just poor quality in service and food are given."}
{"text":"There are a few different categories of pizza to me: standard delivery place pizza, steak house pizza, and gourmet pizza.  The Pizza 3000 in Bowness does the first category and does it well.  It's affordable, they're nice, they deliver quickly, and I recommend trying it as an alternative to the chains.  It's good pizza in its category, but if you take the 'best in Calgary' and 'best in Western Canada' comments at face value you could end up disappointed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good, cheap pizza.

First of all, the \"pick- up special\" of $13.99+ tax for a 16\" unlimited toppings pizza - yowzah! I had 9 hungry mouths to feed so 3 custom pies,  a couple of salads and a dozen wings fit the bill perfectly.

Greasy pizza is my enemy. I have been known to empty half of a napkin dispenser in order to blot the grease from the top of my pizza. There was absolutely no need to even use one napkin to blot this pizza - my stomach thanks you! 

The regular crust had the perfect amount of chew without being too crispy. Pizza 3000 also offers a thin or thick crust and a deep dish pizza but I think we made the correct choice with just the regular.  The sauce had a really nice homemade flavour. All of the toppings tasted like the natural, unprocessed genuine article and were sprinkled generously on the top.

It isn't pizza napoletana but for what it is, it is pretty darn good. 
No dining in. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've tried so far in Calgary and great prices too. 3 crust choices, we chose thick which isn't even as thick as a deep dish but still nice and doughy. You know you're eating a pizza not some healthy mock pizza. Lots of cheese and the perfect amount of sauce (enough to taste but not so much that your cheese slides off). It was so hot when we got it that we needed it to cool. Only 4 stars because I have had better in other cities and because they charged $6 or $10 for delivery depending on who answers the phone, because they had to cross the river to deliver it : ( It's literally a 10 min drive from my house. Still worth it though."}
{"text":"So I recently started a talk topic of great unknown pizza places and thought I should review the one I enjoy most. It is a tiny little place almost hidden along Bowness Road and I have been going there for years. I have no idea how I found it but likely it was by seeing there A frame sign showing just how cheap a 14 inch pizza was. I have a big appetite and to have a 14 inch pizza, with unlimited toppings, for barely double digit prices I can't say no. 

 Unlike big name brand pizza the crust here is not greasy, the sauce has flavour, and the toppings are fresh. You can tell that at some point that green pepper was actually a green pepper. The only downside of Pizza 3000 is their wings, but hey if they had that right I am pretty sure it would be too popular and I would never get a slice."}
{"text":"Tried this business based on positive yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. I am from the east coast and there is a real lack of the Donair that we are used to from back home, however the Donair pizza hit it on the head. Generous amount of cheese, delicious sauce. Well done! Will return when travelling to Calgary again."}
{"text":"Ok pizza but not the best in the area they do have some great deals and are inexpensive, but I would avoid the pizza by the slice as it been in the warming cabinet who knows how long. Business looks very slow there since Pizza 73 opened up across the street."}
{"text":"This is by far our favourite neighbourhood pizza place - it's really quick, inexpensive, and I don't know what it is about it, but it's really scrumptious. This is thicker crust pizza (it's bready - but not in a bad away), lots of cheese and toppings; it kind of reminds me of the pizza I used to eat as a kid. The place is nothing fancy, there is take out and delivery only, and it's a really good value for pizza we consistently enjoy. My recommendation: meat lover's (with a generous helping of chilli flakes). YUM!"}
{"text":"they got 2 locations...17th se, and bowness. its cheap and awesome pizza. i recommend to get fully loaded."}
