{"text":"Really enjoy this place! The owners are very friendly, menu prices are very reasonable. They  have the BEST halo-halo!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at this family owned restaurant. Could not have had a better experience. So friendly and personable while walking us through the menu. It's hard to decide which dish we like best!"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious. Service was very friendly and fast. For a 2 entree and a 3 entree plate it came to be around $14."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Michigan and finally found a great Filipino restaurant. we love the sisig, pork adobo, and bistek. The staff and owners treat us of like family and that's hard to find in Vegas. Try this place out, it will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"What a great family restaurant and great family helping out!  They treat you like family!  You can't find that now a days.  I did not realize they were in the neighborhood, until they had the new sign up.  It was busy during the weekend, but they were able to get my food out hot and ready.  If you are looking for traditional Filipino food then this is the place to eat, there is nothing hipster about this place.  It reminds me of how my mom and aunts used to make it, but better (Sorry mom and auntie!). I had their Goto and it was delicious, along with their halo halo which I believe is the best compared to other places.  I just wished they were open late at night after going out to just have their goto soup.  They do party trays and can host your huge Filipino party at their place for a good deal (No mess, no fuss).  I am looking forward to trying out the rest of their food and gaining an extra 10 pounds. I would recommend this place for traditional food...if you are looking for some new idea or fusion, this is not it. Just good food!"}
{"text":"Goto Queen has a great variety of Filipino food. It's small but it feels very homey and welcoming. It's new and they don't have a big sign or anything noticeable for their business. They had a small paper sign (which was sad, in that it's very easy to miss and see it)   All of the employees are extremely friendly and good people. They always talk to you with a smile on their face and they spoke to me as one of their own kids/ family members. They're very genuine people.  I got the lumpia Shanghai, which came with I believe 6 pieces and Kare-Kare. Their Kare-Kare was flavorful and wasn't bland, which was good. Their lumpia was good as well.  And for dessert I got halo-halo and Ginataang Bilo Bilo. Their Ginataang was fresh but more on the thick side. It was still good!  Overall, everything was actually really good and it wasn't busy. I am definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Great Filipino food for a great price.  First time I came in and I got the three entree tray.  The food is too much.  They give you lots of rice and lots of food which is what I expect from a Filipino place.  I only ate one of the entree and my wife ate half of the lechon.  She does not like Filipino food but loves lechon. I am glad I found this place next to my house.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So good! I called ahead to order some lumpia. Went in to pick it up and ended up with lechon, pancit and lumpia. I was not at all disappointed. The guy at the counter was so nice and honest. They even had a guy help take my food out to my car for me. This place is easy to get to and has lots of parking. If you've never had Filipino food, this is a great place to start."}
{"text":"This place is family owned,  which to me always best food. We need to support more family owned businesses so we can keep them around. Not fast food at all good quality pancit very tasty , tofu. The desserts are excellent Maruya, halo halo, Leche flan. Place very clean. The lady there very helpful and honest explained the menu. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here after reading previous reviews and seeing all the pictures, but it wasn't what we expected. The barbecue has to be ordered in advance so there wasn't any on the steam table."}
{"text":"The people who work their are so nice they really know how to treat their customers . This place makes you feel like you are right at home I highly recommend this place to anyone .   Not to mention their food is so delicious. I love the prices and portions they are unbelievable. The best part is if you are new to the cuisine theyll let you sample the food before hand .   CANNOT WAIT TO EAT THEIR AGAIN !!!!"}
{"text":"My first time in this Filipino restaurant and am very impressed with the cleanliness, ambiance and most especially, the food and service. This place was highly recommended to me by friends, but I only got the chance to try it today. Very friendly pa sila. I'm glad nagkaroon ng Goto Queen dito sa area namin na puede pa nating ipagmalaki. Congratulations to the owners and workers of Goto Queen!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I'm definitely writing one for this place. When you come in you're greeted with a smile. Excellent customer service and delicious food. This is 45 mins drive from my house but definitely coming back whenever I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Referred by a friend and we were not disappointed! Good food, great price and kind service."}
{"text":"Sad they closed. I really loved their goto arroz caldo. Wish there was a way for me to order in bulk. I was really addicted to the stuff"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch for work and the outcome was fabulous !!! This place is clean and food was fresh and hot. It is set up cafeteria Style. I had 2 item plate lechon and bistek. Lechon was crispy, fatty, meaty goodness and bistek was soft and flavorful not too salty or sour had a great balance. The price is very affordable for the quality of food your getting. The staff was very knowledgeable and very friendly. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I am a hesitant eater sometimes when eating Filipino cuisine. However, I continue to explore different dishes and how they are prepared in different places.   Goto Queen is different from other Filipino restaurant kitchens in that the food has a fresh, authentic taste. Other places you can tell the food has been sitting for a while. This was fresh tasting.   Also, the pancit had two different noodles which I really enjoyed. It was hard to discern that there was any meat in it but it was still worth trying.   Sisig was my favorite. The balance of pork,onions and vinegar made a very yummy dish. I would order that dish again. There was a good portion of pork meat, fat and a few pieces of crispy skin.   The atmosphere is very enjoyable. Our server took the time to explain the dishes to me. I have never experienced that in other places. The employees were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ate here once with the family and the staff was very accommodating. The portions were more than enough. We will surely come back when I'm too busy to cook for the family and need a place to go that's nearby. Thank you for opening up a Filipino restaurant close to our home.  We've ordered take out here too- we came pretty late in the day, almost closing time so the choices were very limited. Still, got to feed the family for the night since mommy was too tired.  Ordered Tilapia today for a potluck tomorrow and the guy I spoke to, Spencer was so nice. Thank you for offering to make the spicy sauce for it too. Merry Christmas to all the staff and we wish you a successful business in the coming year."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but this one deserved it. Pretty close to my mom's house so we had halo-halo while waiting for our to-go pancit. Really awesome guy at the counter - was always smiling and asked everyone if they're okay. The quality of the food is top notch and was really affordable, really can't go wrong 1 combo meal for less than $5.00. Will definitely keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place whenever I miss filipino food. I like the turo-turo style cos it reminds me so much of home. The food is good, I especially love that I could get freshly cooked boneless bangus in less than 10 mins! Their 2 choice combo is good enough to share with 2-3 people, and very reasonably priced! I gave 4 stars because I tried their goto and I really wasn't impressed, it was very thin and not much rice or meat in it. I also wished they would open earlier because I would love to have the option of goto or arrozcaldo for breakfast. Otherwise, try this place out! Really friendly service and good food!"}
{"text":"Coworker and I decided to try a Filipino spot near our office (they are extremely hard to come by) so we were excited to find Goto Queen was nearby. There are a couple of downfalls and this is coming from the one that got stuck in the office while my coworker went to pick up the food. First, there is no online menu which was really hard to know what exactly I was going to get. Some of the photos on here were helpful but everything I wrote down was apparently not available at the time. I wanted the 2-item lunch combo with beef caldereta and lunchon. None of these were available and ended up with Pork Adobo & Menudo (coworkers recommendations). They were both ok. It comes to taste - it wasn't awful but I definitely prefer the spice to the adobo I typically have. Goto Queen was a bit more sweet tasting - which totally threw me off. Second, the portions. Considering I spent about $10.00 on this meal - the portions aren't that big. I just got a huge portion of rice and very little meat to come along with it. Taking the meal to go might not be the best because everything is very juicy and usually in some broth of sorts and it gets messy! Perhaps this place is best when you dine-in as opposed to take out since the photos I see on here usually show good portions and at least you get to pick your own when you are there.  I think I will give this place another try since the food wasn't terrible - just not what I am used to. Maybe next time I will get the lumpia and hopefully they will have the beef caldereta available."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this restaurant. Authentic Filipino food on the northwest side of town. I especially like their guinatan. We ordered some food for a party and very happy with what we received."}
{"text":"So far so good especially goto with sweet rice and it's my first to eat here. I really gonna come back."}
{"text":"There was so much food and it was very flavorful.  There were a couple that was okay.  But, for adventurous eaters this place is recommended."}
{"text":"I was looking through Yelp and found out that there's a Filipino fast food/restaurant only 2 minute drive away from my place. Great location cause it's just across AMC movie theater. I've probably seen this place before but didn't know that \"Goto\" queen was referring to the Filipino porridge, goto, which is a Filipino favorite. I've been looking for a homemade mami or goto place here in Vegas just like those \"mamihan\" in the Philippines, and this one is the best one I've been to so far. Their goto is the traditional, homemade goto, and they have different Filipino dishes to choose from. Owners are really friendly and fun to talk to. They have pastries, halo-halo, filipino drinks and juices, ice cream, and karaoke. This place is a must if you're around the area and wants a quick Filipino food to satisfy cravings."}
{"text":"It is by far the best goto and arroz caldo i tried here in Las Vegas! Authentic Goto and Arroz Caldo it is like your eating in the Philippines!!! This a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have been very satisfied with the food and service at all times.  Christine and Mick are very friendly.  Place is very clean with a big screen TV showing the current Filipino show.  They have a variety of food to choose from.  Filipino favorites such as Kare-kare, lechon kawali, adobo and of course, their specialty, Goto.  If you've never tried Filipino food or are looking for one, give them a try, totally worth the drive to Rainbow and Smoke Ranch."}
{"text":"Fairly new family owned business. Everyone is kind and treats everyone like a friend as most Filipino families do. Very welcoming.  Service: 5/5, like I said they're fairly new so they may still be working out some kinks here and there.  Their name is not on the plaza sign along with other businesses in this plaza, which may cause difficulties when trying to find it; however they have a huge sign above the restaurant.   They temporarily only have a small menu that reads: 1 item combo ($4.99), 2 item combo ($5.99), 3 item combo ($6.99).  On my visit, I tried: Fried chicken: Extra crunchy & seasoned just right, just how I prefer it.  Kare kare: My brother's go-to. They put everything kare kare usually comes with + tripe, which he loves. Sauce on point. A must try.  Lumpia Shanghai: How can you not love egg rolls? Tiny pieces of high cholesterol. Mmmmm.  Bangus: My favorite item to order when I go to Filipino places. Crisp to a T.   The cassava cake was probably the best thing I've had here, along with the bangus. All the desserts, especially the leche flan, are A1!!!!! Definitely need to pick some of the desserts up when you're here.   All in all, I try not to eat Filipino food too much, but I would definitely come back to visit. They do deliver by eat24 and they also accept Apple Pay. So you have no excuses but to try it!"}
{"text":"Went there to pick up food to go for dinner. The food was very greasy."}
{"text":"I placed and order for pick up when I had noticed the menu here on help. There are 3 things I normally order when I try a new Filipino restaurant and if it's not to my liking, I don't go back. I ordered the chicken adobo to go with half steamed rice and pancit which to my surprise was decently priced. When I got to the restaurant, I was advised they ran out of pancit so instead they have me half and order of palabok. The place was pretty big, very clean and good is set up cafeteria style. I looked at the other dishes available and I really wish I could have tried everything. The service was quick as my food was ready in less than 10 mins since I work right around the corner. The adobo was very very tasty and I haven't had palabok for so long but I forgot how much I use to love it. The palabok was delicious! I definitely will be back to try more dishes. I'm so glad there is finally a Filipino place close to my home."}
{"text":"Ive been dying for good goto here in the valley. I went there last week. Originally me and my wife were supposed to get Mexican Food, but we saw this across from Pepe's and i couldnt believe i was actually seeing the word \"Goto\" :)  We met the owners and they were very welcoming. There is a wide selection of Filipino Food. They also take in requests if you want to have a certain dish.   My wife and I tried the beef goto. It was so good, i honestly hadnt had that kind of goto even in the Philippines.  I recommend this place to everyone if you want good soul food with. Filipino Taste :)"}
{"text":"They charged me twice for the same lumpia tray.  On 10/30/16 they said my credit card did not go through and asked for another card.  Both transactions went through and I was charged $43 twice.  I called them to let them know but when my credit card company contacted them they denied it. Thieves."}
{"text":"It was our lunch break and everyone in the office wanted Filipino food. Our go-to Filipino place isn't open for lunch anymore and the glowing 5-star they have - that's how we ended up here. Interestingly enough, those perfect reviews were written by people with 0-5 reviews or no profile picture. Ay naku, it was probably the titos and titas that wrote the reviews!  The windows were plastered with pictures of their menu items. It's a carinderia/ turo-turo place where you point (using your finger or your pouty lips) at the item you want. My parents told us never to go to places like this when I was growing up but I didn't know what to expect and we were already here.  You grab a tray. Pick what you want to eat. I got garlic rice, lechon and lumpia. 3/4 of my plate was garlic rice and they put my lechon and lumpia in separate containers for some unknown reason. I think they change up some of their menu items daily. I was hoping to try their pancit palabok because I haven't found a place in this town that makes a good palabok. But they didn't have it the day I went.  Garlic Rice: It wasn't garlicky enough and it needed a bit nuts re salt (this is coming from somebody who is salt-sensitive). The rice is old, dry and hard. 1/5  Lechon: Wow! They actually have chopped up lechon. But they gave me the fattiest bits and not enough meat. The skin is fantastic though. Crispy crunchy goodness! 4/5  Lumpia: Pork lumpia. I love lumpia but not this version. The carrot flavor was overwhelming. The meat and veggie flavors are supposed to balance each other and that didn't happen here. 1/5  The older gentleman was nice. The place is small and tight, and between the TV and people eating here...it gets loud. I'll get food to-go next time if I ever come back."}
{"text":"Clean and organize place to eat your favorite goto, arrozcaldo, chicken mami. Customer service is A+++ we eat here every week breakfast / lunch and or even dinner.  Goto tiaong with sweet rice is the best!!!"}
{"text":"I came here after seeing it on Yelp. I've been craving for some hot soup on this cold day and thought there's nothing better than a bowl of Goto, just like what I used to do when I was growing up in the Philippines. They're goto really tasted good. It's authentic Filipino cooking. Although they have food on display, cafeteria style, they prepared my goto after I ordered it. I saw that they have arrozcaldo too and bought some too because some people in my household doesn't eat beef. They're serving portion is good. I also bought 2 orders of their 2 items combo. I wanted to try most of their food that's why I did that. I ordered their fried chicken, pork sinigang, sinigang na salmon head and sautéed  mongo. I ordered them all to go, and was quite surprised by the big portion of rice when I got home. One order of the 2 item combo rice is already good for 2-3 people unlike other Filipino restaurants that just gives a cup of rice.  Anyway, here's my review for the food. The Goto is really good. It has tripe and bits of beef in it. Maybe they can add a little bit more of rice in it, but aside from that, it's really tasty. The arrozcaldo had a lot of chicken meat and 2 hardboiled eggs. It's also good, but is not a big fan of ginger, and it has a lot! As in every spoonful of arrozcaldo has strips of ginger in it, and it's not enjoyable to bite into a piece every time you put the food into your mouth. They could also add a little bit more of rice in it. I understand that sweet rice eventually melts into the soup, but perhaps combine it with some regular white rice, so that there will be some visible rice in it, when served. Just a suggestion.  The fried chicken is essentially marinated and is as good as my mom's home-cooked fried chicken. I didn't get the chance to taste the sinigang na salmon head because my hubby devoured it in an instant. He said it's good too. Their pork sinigang is also good and is just the way I like it. Not too much meat in it though because they used the bony parts of the pork, which I think what added flavor to the soup. And lastly, the sauteed mongo is also tasty. It had no meat in it, but they used shrimp instead.  The food is good and authentic. The customer service is also good because they are instantly there, ready to serve you. The place is clean. Overall, I can affirm that I will come back here to have my goto cravings satiated. I would have given them 5 stars if it weren't for those minor details that I mentioned above."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch! I tried their Mami soup it's so good not greasy and enough portion of meat, noodles and soup. They gave us a sample of their desert and they're not too sweet just right."}
{"text":"Loved it here looking forward to coming back to this place. Although i didnt care for the adobo like mines with a vinegar taste. they let us try the goto it was yummy. I found another filipino place to eat right up the street from me."}
