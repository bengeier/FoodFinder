{"text":"Okay I do not have a clue why blu burger has such good ratings, Red Robin throws together a better burger and fries than this place. To start off I was practically starving when I arrived, which is the only reason I ate my burger. The frier oil was old and unchanged which caused my fried to taste like fish, not only that; the fries were fried incorrectly...they were soggy and disgusting. The burger I ordered was a standard burger...cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato and meat on an onion bun. The onion bun was just a typical not great but not inedible store bun..the yellow kind and the meat was disgusting dry and flavorless as well as being the size of a fast food patty.  The toppings were put on incorrectly so the burger fell apart immediately. It just wasn't good. I honestly regret going and eating the food I really would have rather gone to Red Robin. I do not recommend anyone going, but if you go please go with the mentality that it is specifically a burger place...and prepare to not be super thrilled and for people saying It's the best burger, I feel sorry for you because it just isn't good."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. Try the Bison or Kobe. Great service too. Bob was our server. A true professional. Everything was excellent. Sweet potato fries were also awesome...
You wont be leaving hungry. Huge burgers and very tasty!"}
{"text":"If I could give them NO stars, I would.

We have eaten at the BluBurger location on Jomax and had a great experience.  Good food, decent service, no complaints., so when a new location opened up around the corner from our house we decided to check it out with our neighbors and their 2 kids.

I arrived first and went to put our name in for a table but instead I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  The hostess finally came over and when I requested a table for 4 adults and 2 kids, she let out a sigh and told me that they were completely backed up and could not seat us.  Confused, I scanned the dining room and counted no less than 4 empty tables and 3 teenaged waiters milling around aimlessly.  Dude, the hostess hasn't even met my neighbors kids yet and she was already throwing us out!  At this time, the rest of my party arrived and I let them know what the hostess told me.  My husband walked over to her and asked why she wouldn't seat us mentioning the open tables.  The hostess told us that they were short staffed and backed up in the kitchen but she will seat us anyway.  She also added that we would get no service, not even water, for 20 minutes or more.  WTF.  

I have never in my life encountered such a thing in any restaurant - especially one that was newly opened, the smell of fresh paint still in the air.  Certainly not the way to treat potential customers.  Instead of sticking around and starving, we all ended up at Pei Wei a few steps away.

Apparantly we weren't the only ones annoyed with the rudeness of BluBurger.  Within minutes of us sitting down at Pei Wei, 3 other groups from BluBurger walked through the doors.  They got tired of waiting as well.

So, can't comment of the food at this particular location but the attitude that we got there was so atrocious that we will not be going back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Suprised to find an egg sandwich on the menu. And it didn't disappoint. Had been craving one of late and this hit the spot. This place is a little out of the way for me but I'll be back.  They have a huge selection of wines and the burgers looked amazing."}
{"text":"The best burgers around!

Staff is friendly. Food comes out quickly but is well prepared and presented. 

Convenient location."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Had all the burgers and they are great. Check the chalkboard for off the menu specials like fried green beans or bbq pork burger. Outstanding craft beer choices also."}
{"text":"I've been trying all the new burger places in town and I keep hearing about the turkey burger at the Blu Burger Grille. Where's the beef? Who cares! We gave it a try and it was delicious. You get to build your own burger here. You pick your meat, your cheese, your bun and toppings. I had the turkey burger with mixed greens, tomato, gorgonzola cheese, fresh jalapeno slices (not pickled) and roasted red pepper mayo. It comes with regular or sweet potato fries. I opted for the sweet potato, good choice.The burger had a great char broil taste and the quality of the toppings was top notch. Chris, our server was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. They also have a very good selection of craft beer on draught, only $3. This was without a doubt the best upscale burger I have ever had. Give it a try, you'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with a groupon coupon. They took the groupon no problem, but the meal was still expensive! We didn't order any drinks just two burgers, and our bill totaled (including the groupon discount and tip) $38. The burgers were good, and they did allow you to put anything on it (for a small fee). The sweet potato fries were okay. The lighting at this location is lacking; it felt like we were eating in the dark. Not sure if we will go here again... I think I would rather go to Fez instead. Their burgers are fantastic, cheap, and their sweet potato fries are delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I really liked this place. The service was excellent. The burgers were done perfectly. The atmosphere is pretty cool. Some people were dressed nice and I was in my yoga pants/t-shirt and fit in fine.  Burgers with a side cost about $11 - $15.  The sweet potato fries were the best I've had. They were crispy with a little sea salt."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. For the prices they charge the quality of burgers is sad. Over cooked, unseasoned burger on a stale bun for $20 are you kidding me? Servers tried to accommodate but almost like they know the food is not good. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We were regular customers. Our last visit was 3 months ago & we won't be headed back. During dinner, a girl came in with a rat and they allowed her to sit at the bar with the rat on her shoulder. It was crawling all over her, under her hair, in and out of her clothing. Not at all appropriate for a restaurant where food is being served. I am a pet lover and while I have many pets of my own, no pet should be climbing in a customer's hair while they sit at the bar in a restaurant. Even trained service animals are not allowed up on furniture. Even more upsetting was that the restaurant staff visited and pet the rat. After petting the rat, they just went about their business. I didn't see anyone wash their hands before getting drinks or serving food to customers."}
{"text":"Very bad experience! Server was insulting from the moment she dragged her big fat behind up to the front door to open it - five minutes late on a Sunday morning. Right then, I knew things weren't going to be good. 

A month or two ago, some new, older friends from church took me there for lunch after service. We got there in separate cars, and walked up to the door at 11:30 on-the-dot. The door still had the \"Closed\" sign hanging. mmmm . . . ok. Maybe they're running a little late this morning? The wife of the couple that took me, however, couldn't take the heat very well, as it pounds down on the front of this crap-hole, full-on at this point of the day. She went back to the minimal shade provided by the car to wait. 

Finally, at 11:35, big girl shows up at the front door (btw, no name tag, and no \"Hi, I'm so-in-so, and I'll be serving you today,\" so this is the best, most accurate way I can describe her). The insulting, degrading service began there. Seeing this elderly, frail couple standing outside in the blinding, hot sun, she took her dear old time opening the door. 

Instead of immediately opening the door with an apology and smile, she thought it better to change the \"Closed\" sign to \"Open,\" and a couple other things. I can't remember right at this moment; maybe it was opening the blinds or something? I forget - but I can tell you it took her a good 45-60 seconds to get around to opening the door. Oh, and worse yet, this bitch didn't even hold the door for us!!!!! (Maybe that's what I was thinking of?) She unlocked it, turned around, and walked away. WE WERE SHOCKED! 

BUT, my friends were paying - I was their guest - they had been here before (as had I), so I had to go along w/the flow. These are very good, tolerant and forgiving Christians, so we stayed. Had it been me (not nearly as good and tolerant a Christian:), I would have given her an attitude adjustment forthwith! 

FOOD & SERVICE:

Things didn't get any better once seated. Guess who our server was?! YUP! She was horrible! Even my new friends said something about her BAD attitude! She never ONCE smiled, acted even remotely kind or like she gave a rat's ass once throughout the entire meal. I can best sum up her service this way: she did everything but roll her eyes (in front of us, anyway). 

The burgers/meal was \"mehhhhhh,\" at best. The beef was tasteless and from experience, I could tell they were (trying to) cover that fact up with the plethora of dressings that made up the better part of the burger and bun, itself! And when considering the OUTRAGEOUS PRICES, it sucked! I wasn't paying, so I didn't see the grand total, but judging by what we each ordered (no alcohol), I'm sure it wasn't cheap! 

When I go out to eat and am picking up the tab and have great service, I don't hesitate to make the tip AT LEAST 20%, and often round that UP to $10, $20, etc. If the service is so-so and the food's good, it's 15%. If the service sucks, the server gets little or nothing. 

If the service is really bad, as it was in this instance, I purposely leave only two-cents (yes, two pennies) and in a very obvious place, to show my utter distain for the server. In this case, just based on the way we were treated by this woman at the front door, I wouldn't have even sat down. 

SAVE YOUR MONEY! Don't waste your time here. Judging on how empty this place was when we left over 1.5 hours later, my guess is that they'll soon be forced to shut down just like their Shea Street/Scottsdale location had to. Note also that I said I had been there before. Both times within the past year, both times in the middle of Happy Hour, both times 75% empty."}
{"text":"This place has amazing burgers and fries. You can tell it's better quality ingredients but is a little over priced."}
{"text":"I agree with Don J. We ate there this week, and had the barbeque burger (with a split fee), and there was nothing special about the burger at all. Our wait staff was attentive, though one of the staff members had BO which was noticeable standing beside our table. 
The onion rings were good, but there just isn't anything that would compel us to go back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.   The food is great. The staff is very friendly .  I do not understand why any animal should be able to be in a restaurant unless it's a service dog. RAT don't think so

{"text":"By far the best veggie sandwich I've had in a long time! My boyfriend got a burger and I was able to stick to vegetarian fare. The service was decent. We were one of the only tables in the restaurant. The lighting was kind of overwhelming but, I think it was just the time of day paired with the blue walls. I felt like I needed my sunglasses. The blue moon my boyfriend ordered seemed a little flat but overall, we would go back."}
{"text":"I have a lot of food allergies and this place is the worst. The waitress was really rude and snotty when I asked her questions about food preparation/ingredients. I seemed to be bothering her. I try to be extra nice to people because I know I'm a unique case, but they were very unprofessional about it. No one at this restaurant, including the chef, could answer my questions about what their food is made of. It is infuriating and humiliating to have to cancel orders and walk out because I can't risk getting sick- a restaurant should know what they're serving and be able to let you know what their food consists of. Don't recommend this place if you are gluten free, or if you have any other food sensitivities."}
{"text":"This is the family's favorite burger place! It's awesome! I recommend habanero burger!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today around 1:30 after hiking Spur Cross. It was 10-15 minutes before a server approached our table. We were given menus but not asked what we would like to drink. After sitting there another 5 minutes without any more service, we left. 

They weren't busy since the lunch rush was over. The terrible service may have been a fluke, but there are too many places to eat in Scottsdale to chance a repeat of today again. I won't be going back to Blu Burger Grille."}
{"text":"Excellent place to relax and enjoy a drink and a burger. I like the bison burger and kobe burger. They are also vegan friendly.  Well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the integrity of the chief. Two of four in our party ordered burgers medium. They came out rare. I ate mine, it was good and the 11 year old asked me because it was so rare if it was safe to eat? I said we could send it back but she said no. We saved about 20% of her patty and asked the wait person to show the kitchen what came out as medium and stated we were just giving feedback not looking for anything else. The wait person came back and said the chief said that is their medium. I'm telling you if you asked 10 people 80% would say rare, the others medium rare. NO one would say it was medium. Very disappointed they did not own up to there mistake. Other than this issue the meal and service was a 4 star."}
{"text":"I like choices.  I like Blu Burger Grille because, while they serve other menu options, the central concept is building your own burger which means you've got choices.

I like the idea that you can build your own burger and that \"burger\" can mean other things like \"lamb\", \"turkey\", \"veggie\" , \"salmon\", Kobe, etc....

The other thing I like about the Blu Burger Grille is that they serve Sweet Potato French Fries as a french fries option!  (Although - to be honest - I still think that Fez serves better Sweet Potato FF and their garlic sauce is to die for.)

I wasn't impressed with the service and the outdoor \"patio\" is overlooking the parking lot.  The place overall  is exactly what I've come to expect from Arizona strip mall restaurants.  

But don't let my last paragraph deter you -- on the whole - it's a kind of fun experience - the true \"blu\" definition of \"have it your way.\""}
{"text":"My favorite is the buffalo burger with goat cheese.  Great sweet potato fries and nice atmosphere.  The burgers are huge and delicious."}
{"text":"Never again.  

We used to eat there consistently for a few years, but after one too many poor food experiences for their overpriced fare, we stopped going.  I think it's been at least 2 years since we had eaten there, it could have possibly been 3.  Last night, we wanted something different and saw the \"new ownership\" sign outside, so we decided to give it another shot, hoping for a better outcome.  The place looks identical to how it did before, so without that sign one would never know there was anything different.

So, my wife, son and myself wait for service (my ice water glass smelled like bleach when I drank from it), and finally get our orders taken.  First of all, there isn't a burger on that menu that approaches $10 - $12, much less $18.  I ordered the Blu Burger, my wife had a chicken sandwich, and my son (he's 16, so not a toddler) had a southwestern-type burger.  Let's start with his; it was a mess.  It had so much sauce on it it was falling apart and was mushy, to the point where he couldn't finish it, and stopped after eating half.  My wife's chicken sandwich wasn't hot, \"just lukewarm\" in her description.  Nothing memorable or special about it.  When my supposedly \"medium well\" burger arrived, I didn't think it seemed hot enough, but looked ok in the dark atmosphere that is the BBG.  Against my better judgement I bit into it, and confirmed my suspicions, it wasn't hot.  I muscled through it, thinking the whole time how I was going to get sick.  Additionally, we all 3 ordered the truffle fries ($2 upcharge per order), which were all not hot, and actually quite a joke as all they do to make them truffle fries is a few dashes of olive oil and throw some shredded Parmesan cheese on them, which of course isn't melted because the fries aren't hot enough.  Basically, $2 an order would have been too much, much less $2 per order to upgrade to the truffle experience.

When the bill came, the total was $73 and some change.  We eat out a lot and I have a pretty good idea of what meals should and should not cost, as well as if the experience and/or quality provides a justification for a tab that high for a fast-casual dinner.  The Blu Burger Grille does not provide any of the above.  The food, service & ambiance was mediocre at best, and honestly food served at those temps could be downright dangerous.

Well, guess what?  I have been up and down to the bathroom all night as a result of eating a terrible, under-cooked mess of a burger.  Thanks for starting my long weekend off with an uncomfortable night of sleep and gastrointestinal distress that is still bothering me this morning.  

So as I said at the beginning - NEVER AGAIN.  Yelp can be helpful for those that use it, but I'll also be telling everyone that asks for a recommendation to avoid it at all costs.  It takes a really bad or really good experience to get me to waste my time writing one of these, see my other reviews as proof and realize how strongly I feel about my recent dinner at Blu Burger Grill."}
{"text":"I love Blu Burgers food but the staff is just plain rude. Ordering take-out from there is a true experience...and not a good one. They hung up on me like five times because no one wanted to deal with me. However, the burger was great and I liked how you can build your own burger from start to finish. Eat at your own risk...waiters can be very mean."}
{"text":"Didn't care for the service.  Felt as if our patronage was inconveniencing there time.  However, The food was great, but kinda pricey - $10.00 a burger I expected much more for what we got.  LOVED the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!

I should start off by saying I don't eat red meat and even though this is a burger place, they have lots of other options such as turkey, mushroom, or even veggie burgers. 

I had a turkey burger and loved it! The bread is also just amazing! My boyfriend had the Blu Burger and he notes himself as somewhat of a food connoisseur and he said this was the best burger he had ever had in his entire life and he raved about it all day long! 

Also their sweet potato fries are to die for. I absolutely love them and I have never liked sweet potato fries before anywhere else!

This place is a must visit and we will definitely be back when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Found my new burger spot in Chandler. Bison burger, sweet potato fries, and fried green beans were superb. Nothing like a good bison burger, good micro brews, and good music in the background. Can't wait to hit it for happy hour. If you like a quality burger and chill atmosphere, I recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Ate here on an off day during the week on their dog friendly patio. No wait, just friendly service and a good lemonade with egg sandwich."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on my birthday and I did the build your own burger with the kobe beef burger. One of the BEST burgers I have ever had. Great flavors and melts in your mouth!  I definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"I waited until the new owners had the opportunity to work out all of the kinks and tried it this weekend for the last time.  The food is good.  That's all the good I can say.  The atmosphere and decor are weak.  And its WAY over-priced.  An 8-ounce Kobe Beef burger is $18.  Let that sink in...$18.  That was enough for me.  

Apparently the new owners have fixed an attitude issue that was present under old management.  And the staff this time were very nice.  But the reason I didn't like the place the last time wasn't the staff, it was the prices.  And that hasn't changed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it's in a great location and has a good selection on the menu. As a vegetarian I was impressed with the fact that they offered more than one non-meat entree, including a veggie burger, a portobello burger, and an egg salad sandwich. The problem was that the veggie burger was almost inedible. They had deep fried it, which was certainly unexpected. Deep frying it robbed it of flavor, made it unhealthy, and made it scalding hot and crunchy. The bun it was served on was brushed with oil or butter and was ice cold. It would have been nice if they had grilled the veggie patty, which I assume they do when someone orders a regular burger. 

Service was lacking. The server, who came from behind the bar to take our order acted like we were bothering him. Despite there being almost no one else in the restaurant at the time, we never got a refill or were asked if the food was okay. I had to flag him down to finally get our ticket. We left half the food on our plates. He never asked about it or offered a take out box, which we didn't want but would have shown some consideration. Nice try but disappointing."}
{"text":"A lot of money for little atmosphere.  The floor was sticky, the service was only okay, and the noise from the kitchen was unforgiveable.  The kitchen is very close to the dining room.  In the middle of the meal, around 6PM, the kitchen staff began doing something with the dishes that sounded like dishes breaking over and over.  I realized that they were probably unloading the dishwasher.  Where was the owner?  This was obnoxious.  We can buy a better burger and warmer, and less dry at In and Out, and especially for a lot less money.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are done with this place.  We've been coming here for years but over the last year they have really gone down hill. The last 4 visits have been awful but we kept saying let's give them one more try but not anymore. What used to be big juicy burgers have turned into obviously frozen pre-made thin patties. Their sweet potato fries used to be thin and crunchy but are now thick and mushy. The zucchini fries used to be thick cut vegetables with a thin breading. Now both sides are cheap frozen crap. The frozen zucchini fries are tiny stringing mushy insides with a thick doughy batter exterior.  What a shame we now have to drive down to Scottsdale Quarter for a decent burger instead of supporting the local business down the street."}
{"text":"Took about 40 minutes to get our food, and I found a hair in it, luckily I did not bite into it"}
{"text":"Two words: Fresh jalepenos. Spicy, non-pickled, delish! 

We had a great experience when we were there in late afternoon on Sunday - good service, no waits, killer wine list. 

Massive burgers - I'm taking the boyfriend back there for date night sometime very soon."}
{"text":"The burger with guac. is sooo good. Get it on a wheat bun, and a side salad. Service was a little slow, but thought the place was pretty good."}
{"text":"Went into this relatively new Blu Burger and loved the new menu! And I like the location too. Pretty, upscale, and comfy. I loved the new Greek Sald with Salmon, and my friend Marilyn had the same! I actually was able to meet Josh, their manager, and he lives and breathes this restaurant seven days a week and his efforts show!  Will go back again and again. See, it's the people and food that counts in a restaurant. I do have a question though...have you ever noticed that so many people who love a restaurant don't go on Yelp as often as the one's who don't like a place? It's sad. this place deserves all five stars and more!"}
{"text":"nice location , good service but a little slow. been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold, they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice.. overall i enjoy the food and would go back."}
{"text":"Real local family upscale burger joint. The portions are large and in charge. Dig the sweet potato fries and we always have a great service there.

This isn't a Micky Dees' people so don't expect those prices, the quality is much better and the pricing reflects that and worth it.

{"text":"Great place, fresh ingredients. I would recommend it. The service is good. I got the veggie burger it was very tasty, the sweet potatoes are amazing."}
{"text":"The burgers were tasty and made to order.  I went during lunch hour and didn't have any trouble getting a table and we were in and out very quickly.  The servers were attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 230pm so it wasn't very crowded and it ensured fast and friendly service. I don't eat most meat so I settled for a build my own salmon burger.  My delightful server asked if I wanted cheese and I said I didn't know about cheese on fish.  She said have crumbled goat cheese. So I did.  Came out quick and hot on ciabatta bread.  It was delicious ...I should have tried the fries. The cole slaw was okay but i like mine with more kick.  Had a cold Fat Tire and it was great combo
I had planned to try the veggie burger but she said they were good but frozen andhad to be fried to keep them together so I wasn't real keen on frozen.  I'm sure it's better than the Boca Burgers in my freezer, but with everything else tasting so good my only suggestions to do what Cold Beer and Cheeseburger does just south on Scottsdale and make the fresh each day.  This is going to be a regular spot for me and friends. If you are up this way you must try it. And don't for get the delicious goat cheese on your burger. Great service"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm giving a burger joint 5 stars. Three of us went on a Sunday night and were surprised to find the place close to full. We sat at the bar and had wonderful service. My wife and I each had a glass of cabernet and our son had a Blue Moon. They only have one brand of wine, but have it in about 4 different varietals. I had the build your own burger which included a  1/2 pound black angus burger, red pepper mayo, caramelized onions and dill pickles. It was cooked perfectly medium and the red pepper mayo was excellent. My wife went healthier and had the bison burger between to large pieces of iceburg lettuce, while my son opted for the California burger. The fries are of the shoestring variety, but nice and crispy. Only thing that wasn't up to the standard of the rest of the meal was my wife's coleslaw which she said wasn't bad, but was forgettable. Excellent meals all the way around."}
{"text":"I've been a customer at the Blue Burger restaurant at the Summit for years now. I go there over and over primarily for the quality and consistently excellent preparation of the food. It has an excellent cooking and serving staff. Santos the chef and Collette the server are great! May I say that everyone who works at B.B. is excellent. It has a superior wine bar, and Jude (B.B. manager) is an expert in that area. They have great wine specials, as well. It's not just burgers, but soups, salads and pasta dishes are also on the menu. My favorite is a caesar salad and a turkey burger. Great location, lots of parking and reasonable prices make Blue Burger at the Summit a great choice for lunch or dinner. Russ C., Carefree, AZ."}
{"text":"This place is empty these days for a reason.

It took almost an hour to get my supposedly medium-rare Kobe beef burger. I also ordered it with red onions, pickles, chipotle mayo, and on a whole wheat bun. The chef of the evening decided upon himself to correct my order while in the kitchen. I received a very well-done piece of mystery meat (it could have been dog meat at this point, the depressing char masking its true identity) with arugala and bacon on a white bun.

I sent the order back, because for $15, I should be able to make my own culinary decisions. Shouldn't I?

This time, twenty minutes later, I received again a burnt piece of tasteless meat (maybe they ran out of salt and pepper and couldn't figure out where to buy some?), but with the original toppings that I ordered. Well, aside from the bun -- that remained white.

The meat also looked very familiar, and at this point I wouldn't put it past them to have just placed the patty under a heat lamp, went out for a few cigarettes, then returned the burger to me. But I'm also just a cynical bastard. I ate half of the burger before feeling like vomiting a little in my mouth, downed my water, paid (after hunting down my waitress), and left.

If you want to pay this much for a burger, go to Delux instead. The quality at Blu Burger Grille appears to be extreme hit/miss."}
{"text":"We loved it from the time we walked in til the time we left. Our server Brandon was great. Scott the owner came over and introduced himself and we got to know some information about the new owners. Our burgers were both perfect. We will definitely be coming back and bringing our out of town guests. Yum on the zucchini fries too!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time diner here and I got this to go...to say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement because it was delicious.  Turkey burgers are ways hit or miss, but this one was yummy and as juicy as can be.  Fries and onion rings still fresh and crispy...plus very decent portions of sauce on the side. And the bartender, Jake, was so nice that next time I go back, I'll eat in and have a drink with my dinner."}
{"text":"Food was really good. One of the best turkey burgers ever. The only thing lacking is ambiance in the restaurant. Very brightly lit and stark and not a warm, inviting feeling. It has only been open a few weeks, so our hope is that something is in the works to change!!!  Definitely will go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very solid hamburger joint.  Don't expect it to be as cheap as the fast food chains, but instead you get many more options and higher quality meats.

The menu is pretty small, but that's what makes it good.  Why go to a place that has a hundred different hamburger recipes when you can choose from what they specialize in.  If your in the mood for a burger that is very lean, and doesn't sacrifice on taste then you would love to try the Bison burger.  If your a person like me who tends to like their burger more on the juicy, fatty side, then go for the Kobe burger.  They are both delicious and you won't be sorry with either.

Of course they have other options which targets to all audiences.  Oh, make sure to try out their malts and shakes, they are actually really good there."}
{"text":"Omg I ordered fish and chips or let me say 3 fish sticks with extra batter and a serving of McDonald French fries. Lets say for 13.00 I walked out starving. They need to address this entree. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best burger place in town . My husband got kolbe and said he really couldn't tell the difference in the taste between that and the angus . It is so tasty .. The only thing I didn't really care for was loud led zeppelin blaring but other than that great service and great food ."}
{"text":"This is a easy review, this place is great! If you like burgers cooked just the way you like this is a place for you. They also have excellent flavored mayonnaise and mustard and then the buns, fresh and soft with great tastes. 
Their  zucchini fries are amazing!  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.
I only wish they had a Blu cheese burger.

I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Stopped in last minute as we decided we didn't want to drive too far from the creek. Great decision...food was outstanding, service was very good, and the place was very clean. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  Horrible fries, rancid tasting oily beef.  Careless staff. 

Way overpriced. 

Steer clear."}
{"text":"I would say the fries were the best part (had sweet potato) but the boyfriend who had regular fries said his were comparable to burger king's. We were so ready for an amazing burger and definitely had our expectations set high because of the prices. I had the \"Blu Burger\". I love gorgonzola but that was the ONLY thing I could taste. Couldn't taste the meat that I think I just spent $14 on, even the bacon, onions ... all just gorgonzola slop served in a puddle of more gorgonzola slop. No one was happy about the money we spent today. Our friend reminded us that we were starved and after hiking Tom's Thumb even a mediocre meal probably would've tasted amazing. Not this one.

We didn't say anything, the waitress never asked."}
{"text":"Had my reservations about this place from reading the other reviews. My wife and I decided to dine here on a Saturday evening about 6:00 pm.  We walked right up and were seated promptly.  We were greeted within 45 seconds and had drinks shortly after.  My wife went w one of their signature burgers , habanero, w zucchini fries and I built my own w sweet potato fries.  Food was delivered within 15 minutes and was delicious.  That's when this place started to get busy and service went downhill.  I understand that the servers don't want to be over staffed bc it impacts their take home pay, but when customers don't return bc of poor service it should be a concern.  Once we paid, our check was dropped off by another waiter who simply placed it on our table and kept walking.  No thank you or anything.  In the end it's just a burger and I will choose to dine someplace that appreciates my business.  You're not my boy Blu!!!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Cave Creek, Arizona to visit family, my wife and I stopped to get a quick bite to eat. We were craving a good old fashioned burger, one that had the juices drip down your arm when eating it. Those places are hard to come by; however, we found \"Blu Burger Grille\" located on North Scottsdale Road in the Target/Safeway shopping center at the Summit.

We walked inside and the entire place was painted in an ocean blue color. They also have outdoor seating if you want. What we liked about this place was that they had on the menu \"Build Your Own Burger\" (BYOB). This was FANTASTIC, that I could make my burger anyway that I wanted. I elected to order the chicken burger with sweet potato fries. I had placed spinach and grilled mushrooms on it. Whereas my wife ordered the turkey burger with French fries. The burgers came out, and we had the juices drip down your arm!!!! 

For dessert they also have Gelato as a sweet treat.

Another highlight was, when Jen our server brought our bill, she told us if we paid cash, we got an additional 10% off our bill. WOW!!!  When we are back in the area, we will definitely be stopping by for another BYOB burger."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Blu Burger Grill for over 5 years, but after my experience tonight I will never go back. We went there for dinner and my friend had his service dog with him. The owner came up to us and stated, very rudely, that no dogs are allowed. My friend tried to show the owner the license and paperwork showing that the dog was indeed a licensed device dog, but the owner accused my friend of forging the paperwork without even looking at it. He was extremely disrespectful. The restaurant even has an outdoor patio, but he didn't even offer to let us sit out there. He just basically kicked us out. I have never been treated so badly. We will definitely be contacting the US Dept of Justice and the AZ Human rights commission to make them aware of how the owner discriminated against us and violated our ADA rights. Please do not go to this restaurant that discrimates against disabled people."}
{"text":"Like may others that have popped up all over the valley Blu Burger offers a gourmet spin on an American staple, the hamburger.  When you enter Blu Burger you are immediately reminded why the place is called \"Blu\"!  The menu has all of the usual suspects of protein choices and then you customize it with cheese and other toppings.  Fries here are good, I recommend the sweet potato ones.  Overall it's a good burger but lunch can easily run you $25-30 a couple and for a burger and fries that's a bit much in my book."}
{"text":"My grandmother had the American burger and loved it. I am vegan, though, and I wanted a burger as well but there were no great options for me. I had a portobello wrap with a salad (I was informed that the veggie patty is NOT vegan and neither are any of the buns). The wrap was good but I was really just in the mood for a vegan burger. The server who took my order was amazing. Most people wouldn't care about helping me stick to my diet but she pointed me towards an entirely vegan friendly meal and I was very grateful. It would be nice if they could use vegan patties and have a vegan bun option available for those of us who want to join our meat eating families for a meal out.

Edit: Thanks for the response! I'll be back as soon as you guys have the vegan buns!"}
{"text":"Kick ass restaurant now under new management. Staff incredibly attentive and friendly. Amazing happy hour and good drinks (not a light pour) truffle burger was fantastic. Turkey burger (girlfriend got it) was moist and seasoned perfect. Owners son helped as a manager was very friendly. Keep rocking guys! Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"Great burger place!  In a world of burgers are burgers, this place sets itself apart from the rest with quality ingredients, very good service and a friendly atmosphere.  You can build your own or order from the pre-defined menu.  My favorite, the Blu Burger with caramelized onions, blue cheese on an onion roll.  Fries are great, as well as the onion rings.  Well worth the price and the drive if you don't live all that close.  You can get a veggie burger or turkey burger but they stick to what they are good at.  It's a definite return trip for us!!"}
{"text":"A solid entry in the better burger category.  The bun is a little much, but definitely holds up. Good sweet potato fries and quality beer available."}
{"text":"The new owners have really turned this place around. Great service and upscale wine Menu. And it was quite possibly the best burger I've ever had.  I recommend the Brie truffle and mushroom burger!  Worth the drive and will be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The prices are definitely for The Boulders crowd (very expensive). 

The simplest burgers are $10.00 and most are around $15.00. Well the burgers got there fast and were good. But I question the over $30.00 for two burgers....and that was without drinks!! 
I am pretty sure my waitress was more concerned about socializing than doing her job. We were 1 of 6 parties there and there were 2 waitresses and one guy behind the bar with 1 hostess."}
{"text":"Awesome decor and great food. The grass-fed Angus burger is delicious."}
{"text":"The best burgers ever exactly the way you want. Great wine selection and excellent atmosphere.  Nice hip relaxing place. Watch the sunset over the valley sitting on the outside patio."}
{"text":"What I like is the food.  If you want a pretty good burger, American Kobe beef or bison, your way, sweet potato fries and a good shake, come here.  

What I don't like:  If you also want to pay $15 for the burger alone, come here.  I really like this place, but the price is outrageous.  I brought my girlfriend here raving about how good it was and she really loved it, till she saw the bill.  She couldn't believe the cost associated for burgers and said she'd rather we go to d'vine where we spend less and get better food.  Again, great burger but it will cost you."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Blu Burger several times and have always gone away pleased. The food is good for a burger joint and the service has always been great. If there is a negative, it would have to be the atmosphere in that it isn't very conducive to quiet table talk. (Of course you don't generally go to a burger joint for that kind of thing anyway.) 
Definitely give the Kobe burger a try, but for me a good old Angus burger does the job. Pile on the toppings (can you say bacon?) and dig in."}
{"text":"I like Blu Burger.  If you're a burger lover and like to have it \"your way,\" this is a great choice for you.  There's a lot of competition in the \"gourmet burger\" market these days.  Delux is the Phoenix original and I'm a big fan.  Stax (in Old Town) is also very good.  I mention these others because, while I like Blu Burger, I wouldn't drive from Old Town all the way up to N. Scottsdale for it....I'd just go to Stax.  And, vice versa.  Blu Burger holds its own and does a great job, but not enough that I'm going to drive all the way across town for their \"take\" on a custom hamburger.

If you've got a group, Blu Burger is good choice for variety.  They have veggie, turkey, and salmon burgers, in addition to salads and sandwiches (egg salad, anyone?).  So, unless your friends are incredibly finicky, there should be something to please everyone.  I also applaud the fact that onion rings and sweet potato fries are available as sides.

All in all, Blu Burgers is 4-stars all the way.  Yummy food.  Friendly service.  They do the gourmet burger thing well and you'll walk away full and happy."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the restaurant was filthy. There were massive cob webs hanging from the chandelier and the floors were dirty. The gelato case had grimy hand prints all over it and the place was empty, so surely there was enough time to clean up. It made me a little concerned about the cleanliness in the kitchen If the area visible to diners was so poorly maintained. Also, the entire place was filled with the stench of sulfur. It made for a much less appetizing experience."}
{"text":"Oh man, I survived (Thanks Susan:)!!!  Had the kobe beef (well cooked) with green chilli, onion rings,swiss, lettuce and A1 sauce.  Burgers are huge to say the least and the number of  bun, types of meat and toppings choices make this place an experience to try.  My only con would have to be the price as it's a build your own burger place and the toppings can get a bit costly.  Would recommend trying!"}
{"text":"Where's the beer?

Not a huge burger fan - but Boyfriend is and I was craving a cold beer...
We agreed on Blu Burger as we lack restaurant options north of Deer Valley Road and East of Cave Creek Road.

We had been before and had a great meal.  Considering I don't love burgers - I was exceptionally happy with my meal.

BUT - here is the issue - 
I didn't pay much attention to the beer menu the first time - I wasn't impressed but settled on a Corona.  But last night - craving a nice cold beer after a long week at work - I scanned the beer menu - well - it took 2 seconds to scan and all I saw were the likes of Bud Light, Miller Light, Coors Light, Amstel Light, Corona etc...  
So help me understand - Fancy Burger Joint serving up College Beer?
Fat Tire and Stella on tap just don't cut it for me.

I politely asked (did not complain - simply inquired) the manager what the deal was and he showed me the beer list saying they had plenty of beers. He also told me that they were more of an upscale burger / food place.  Well no sh*t - I knew that already - so I just want to know why they think it is OK to serve (in my opinion) - crappy beer (again - just my opinion).
Why not get some great micro-brews on tap - and maybe a couple of the 'upscale' beers in a bottle - a Newcastle would have been fabulous last night.

They have a decent wine selection as well as liquor - but to me - wine and burgers just don't mix - while a beer and a burger would have been so savory last night.

BUT - I won't knock the food - the burgers and the options are great - the fries are excellent and we had excellent service."}
{"text":"Some of my friends (who are girls) & I really love this place, if only for the giant bowls of sweet potato fries.  The menu selection is great for those looking to stick to a diet or remain a vegatarian for a little while longer but the real meat burgers are tasty & frequently unique (lamb burger w/ yogurt sauce anyone?).

The atmosphere is pleasant and, like Max A. mentioned, the silverware is pretty nifty....i also like the spatula table numbers.  

The girls & i generally split meals, as long as you don't tell them that's what you're doing because they'll charge you for it!"}
{"text":"Okay, I have added a star to account for my last 2 visits in which I had better experiences.. funny enough they were better because I got service from the other employees and not the same guy from my previous review (who I now noted works during the day at lunch time - when I will avoid this place).

Recently, I called for a pick-up order after work and had a delicious BYOB Bison waiting for me in the styrofoam container along with a huge load of sweetpot fries (which I must admit are stellar).  The server that picked up the phone was really nice and she had my order exactly as I wanted in a matter of 5-8min of ordering... she was friendly and I appreciated that.

I think if I avoid that server (lunch), I could come here more regularly....

Otherwise you already know I\"m a fan of their burgers.. no doubt about that."}
{"text":"Let me first say the burgers are good...staff decent, and the beer \"kinda\" cold-ish...the average age of the patrons is minimum 75yrs old (seriously)...the atmosphere has the feeling of an old folks retirement cafeteria...the host is a distinguished older fella who mans the door as if this is a chic south beach night club (really?)...does this guy own the place? He takes himself super-serious...horrible people skills when directing customers to wait for a table - brutal...feels like witness protection program material....the awkwardness of this dynamic is a pretty okay wait-staff that rolls their eyes in regards to this 70+ target audience...the two 29 inch TV's play movies or CSPAN...(hey, let's put a live game on instead!)...limited bar selection...I bet a bunch of white zin sold here...I feel like a teenager every time I come here...!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner and it was a ghost town. We were the only people in the place and I soon found out why. The service was amazingly slow considering we were the only ones there. We ordered our burgers, you can build your own, and waited. They take the blue part of their name a little too seriously which I could handle except for the obnoxious blue tint on the windows...ugh. when our food arrived my order was incorrect, I was stunned by this seeing how they had one order and could not get that right. Whether it was the fault of the server of the kitchen who knows? I did not mention it I did not feel like waiting for it to be fixed.  So in short, bad food, bad service, unappealing atmosphere, and to top it all off an expensive price for a tasteless burger."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, because we had a good experience with Blu Burger when it was located further south...really disappointing. We both had the $16 Blu Burger (figuring that must be their specialty) -- service was good and friendly, fries were good, but the buns were stale and meat was just so-so. The Habit and Smashburger are way better and a lot less expensive."}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers!  All burgers delicious including turkey and veggie.  Staff friendly and gelato awesome!"}
{"text":"Pretty populated for a Friday night, a good sign!  Great burgers (build your own with a selection of black angus and Kobe) and great onion rings (a hard find). Good selection of local an popular brews on tap."}
{"text":"Food was over salted... New waitress didn't want to split bill for 2 couples... Not the same place we loved a few months ago."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and both times I had yummy burgers. The skinny fries and Cole slaw are great, the slaw is made fresh. They also have custom made burgers which is great. Definitely a must for burger lovers."}
{"text":"This little place has an awesome vibe and they make a mean burger! I was in love with the chandeliers and the color scheme. I ordered a regular burger with a lettuce bun and it was delicious. The lettuce they used got super soggy though, so that was kind of a bummer. They offer an array of burger options, like kobe and bison, as well as a large selection of toppings. 

They also serve Gelato which I just couldn't pass up! The pralines and cream was delicious! Our service was great, the gal was very friendly and attentive. It was a bit on the pricier side, but that certainly isn't surprising for this part of town. Overall, it was a great meal and I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Went in with high expectations and wasn't disappointed. We tried the Blu and Southwest burgers and loved them. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"I had not planned on writing this review, I really was only going to add a quick tip since I'd been thinking of, and missing, Blu Burger, but when I saw the low star reviews, I knew I had to set things straight.  Fellow yelpers, this is NOT a one or two star restaurant.  Is it expensive?  Maybe.  Is it worth the money?  YES!!!  This is not fast food people.  Fast food has it's place and time, but when what you are looking for is a high quality burger with exceptional sides, served in a restaurant with nice atmosphere and table service, this is your place.  Yeah, you're going to pay more than you would in the drive-thru, but, as in many cases, here, you really do get what you pay for.

Let me tell you a little about what you can expect and why I love, and miss, this place:

First, you build your own burger.  All of their burgers are cooked to order and come with a side.  There are several meat (and non meat) options, including: Free Ranch Black Angus, American Kobe, Turkey, Bison, Chicken, Salmon, Veggie, or Portabello Mushroom.  Next, you have a choice of buns: White, Wheat, Onion or Lettuce wrap (for those on the low carb diet).  Their cheese choices are excellent as well and include my favorite goat cheese.  Toppings, specialty ingredients (like Applewood bacon and fresh guacamole) and sauces. 

Second, the sides.  Now, I have to admit that I can really only speak to the quality of the cole slaw and their sweet potato and regular fries, all of which were done right and would, imo, hold their own against any.  Other choices include mixed green salad, zucchini fries and onion rings.  

Third, it's family owned and operated.  I like that.  I feel good about giving my business to locally owned family businesses.  

Finally, the service.  Before moving out of state, hubby and I were regulars here and the service was always good.  The servers were polite, unfailingly quick to refill drinks and truly attentive to all of their customers.

Yes, it's $10 and up for their burgers, but they come with the fixin's AND a side, and that is the going rate for burgers of this caliber.  Not overpriced, just damn fine food, period.

And FYI, it's Blu Burger Grille, not Blue Burger Grill."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday to fuel up before a grocery shopping excursion (need a full belly otherwise to many snack foods end up in the cart!).  This was my first time although my wife had eaten at another of this chains locations once several months ago.  Since it was close to the store I was game to give it a try.

Decor is clean and certainly \"blue\".  We were sat right away at one of the last 2 tables and were promptly greeted by our waiter.  The iced tea we ordered was delivered quickly and we each ordered a build your own burger.  My wife is a vegetarian and ordered the veggie burger and paired it with the zucchini fries.  I had a basic Angus beef burger with slaw.

The service was prompt (the restaurant is so small that it is hard to be forgotten), teas were refilled and even though the place was full we received our food in 15 minutes.   My burger was cooked perfectly, a moist and juicy medium and my wife just raved about the zucchini fries which were crispy and you could actually task the zucchini inside and not just the batter.

All in all a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat if you are hungry and come across one of their locations.  Pricing is moderate to the low compared to other \"gourmet\" burger joints in the valley - $36 tab for 2 (with tip) - a decent value in my book for good food and nice service."}
{"text":"This is a really good burger place for those that want more of an upscale burger. With many meat options (kobe beef, Angus, Bison, salmon etc). Good bread, cheese and condiments. Little bit fancier plating etc

Tried most of the burgers an they are good (especially the blu burger) but you can always make your own as well. They had good sides, sweet potato fries, fried green beans etc

Sad to say it looks like this location closed down :-("}
{"text":"I LOVE that you can buy grass fed beef here!  They also use lots of organic and local produce. I am a huge burger fan and I submit that Bluburgers are among the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Very good food but be prepared for sticker shock.  Pending on the type of burger you get, it will range from $15 to $20.  Granted they do have options like Bison and Kobe Beef, but the food here is pricey...for a burger.  

Our service was great.  The burgers were cooked well and tasted very good, but they aren't the absolute best we have ever had.  The atmosphere was interesting.  There seems to be a good wine selection, and some gelato to choose from too.  Bar appeared to be well stocked. 

If you are truly a burger connoisseur in search of some Scottsdale based options, I would recommend Hopdoddy or Paradise Valley Burger first.  By no means am I saying to avoid this place...it is good food. But if you are in search of the best burger, there are other options out there."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad, but the service SUCKS! never got a drink refill and it took 20mi to get change. Then found out the server was carrying it with her the whole time.. She just forgot. I may just forget to come back until they get new servers. Not only was she slow, she was insulting. Not my idea of a fun time."}
{"text":"Is Blu Burger the most amazing burger I've ever had?  No.  But, it's consistently tasty and fresh.  I love having the option of creating my own burger.  

I think they ought to push the cocktails a little more.  They have a full bar but the cocktails listed on the tables are standard and boring.  I think it would be a great idea to have certain cocktails paired with particular meals."}
{"text":"I'm hoping that someone at the Health Department reads this and is as alarmed as I am about what I witnessed at BluBurger last night.

I was sitting at the bar and ordered a cheeseburger with no add-ons - so no lettuce, tomato, any of that jazz. Literally within three minutes of placing my order the bartender put a plate in front of me. Surprised by the speed but not thinking much of it I ate a couple of sweet potato fries, then noticed that \"my\" burger was awfully dressed up. I lifted the bun up with fingers I just wiped my runny nose with (I know, I'm totally gross but I thought it was my food) and saw that it was not what I ordered. At the very same time the bartender came hurrying back, saying she accidentally gave me someone else's order.

As she whisked it away I explained that she'd have to make it over again because I already touched it and I have a cold. She kind of laughed and brought the plate back to the kitchen window. I watched while the cook did nothing more than put the big toothpick back into to bun and sent the contaminated plate out to the unsuspecting diner.

I don't know if the bartender didn't tell the cook what I said about already touching it and having a cold, or if neither of them cared. What I do know, however, is that is really, really gross, and if I knew that I was eating someone else's snot germs I'd barf.

So if you ate at BluBurger last night and you develop a cold this weekend, now you know why."}
{"text":"This restaurant had the perfect ambience combined with an interesting menu. I am a vegetarian so for me the eye of the prize was the veggie burger. But this wasn't your normal burger order. You get to build it on your own from the type of bun to the toppings and the variety of sauces you like. Though the meat eaters have ample of choices .. I was left with the falafel style veggie patty. 

The veggie burger submerged within an onion bun accompanied by onions, sautéed mushrooms, jalapeños, tomatoes and lettuce went well with my habanero mayo and chipotle mayo sauces on the side.

I have been tryin to find my veggie burger that was flavourful and satisfying ... I think blu burger nailed it!

Ordered the zucchini fries on the side -- nothing special .. No different than tempura veggies at a Japanese restaurant.

Between 2 & 6 pm was the happy hour and that included milkshakes! Ordered the cookies and cream milkshake made from Dryers ice cream. Really yummy!!

Overall a perfect and satisfying experience! Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"So I think this place has the potential to be a 4 star with some changes. I'll keep this short. I ordered the Blu Burger, medium. The toppings were very yummy. I do wish my carmelized onions weren't on the cold side. They REALLY need to season their meat. It just ruins a great burger when the beef patty is bland and flavorless. Salt brings out the meaty and beefy flavor. Otherwise all I taste was char. So for what it is, I feel that the burgers are a bit over priced. Around $9 range instead of $12+ would be more appropriate. I also ordered onion rings. They were quite good. They only gave me 4 though. Wish they gave you more. My gf got the zuchinni fries. They were definitely not on the same scale as the onion rings. They were mushy.... I'd definitely come back if they season their beef...."}
{"text":"It is interesting to see the widely mixed reviews on Blu Burger. We have been there 4 times and every time we have had a great burger, good albeit somewhat slow service but always very friendly.  I would recommend it to any of my friends who want a good burger with lots of choices on how it is topped."}
{"text":"Two & a half stars. I feel bad giving this place a bad review because the old man owner seemed like a nice guy just trying to have a restaurant, but the bottom line is that the prices are a bit too high for food that is just good.

The service was friendly, the beer selection was good, and there are multiple options for vegetarians which is pretty fantastic. I had the portobello mushroom and I love that I could choose fresh garlic and goat cheese as topping options. The garlic basil aioli that came with my burger was awesome - full of delicious pesto flavor. The bun is big and buttery. The fries have to be ordered separately, and they are good, but not $6 good. My fiance had the BBQ Burger and he said it was fine - not out of this world good but fine. 

Just overall my gut feeling is that it's a little too much to spend on a burger and fries. I'd have been just as happy with an in-n-out burger for a whole lot less."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Blu Burger for lunch for years.  We weren't aware they were under new ownership until we stopped in for lunch yesterday. Happily the food has not changed.  We always enjoyed our lunches (blu burger and blu chicken sandwich every time) and yesterday was no different.  Just as good as always.  The staff was friendly and service was excellent.  Yes, prices are a bit high, but quality is good and consistent, and portions are large.  We never mind paying for good food and service.  The decor is a bit tired, but a remodel would surely be expensive.  I wish the new owners all the best and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here last week after my parents raved about this place.  They were kidding about it being the Blu Burger Grille.  It is obnoxiously blue inside!  I had the Bison burger.  I ordered it rare but it came to me overcooked, heh.  I still ate it.  The burger itself was just OK, nothing exciting and nothing to about it to ever make me want to come back to this establishment.  I also had a side order of onion rings which were on point.  The server I had wasn't very efficient.  Very slow service with mediocre food.  I will not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been to bluburger twice now & have not been disapointed. I love all the combinations of meat, cheese & condiments. I had a kobe beef burger w/ cheddar, roasted red pepper mayo, carmelized onions, and more!
Truly a delicious burger, as gourmet as a burger in chandler can get!
Oh, they also have a full bar!"}
{"text":"BluBurger is a standby of mine whenever I make it out to the Target close by.

I've been several times and the food has consistently been good.  Love the California burger and sweet potato fries.  Pretty much know I can get a good burger here, when the mood arises.

I went yesterday with my son and the server mentioned they had a kids meal.  I was really happy, but also disappointed that in all my other visits (always with my son), no other server mentioned that.

The only squabble I had (specifically from yesterday, because I was STARVING), was that I waited almost 5 minutes for a greet.  It was 2p, there were only maybe 4 other tables in the restaurant.  Two or three servers looked at us, but 5 minutes for a greet?  That's not acceptable.  Won't stop me from going back, but still not so good."}
{"text":"While this is an expensive burger venue it is more up market than the average take out burger place.  

Five stars are well earned here. The restaurant was very clean.  The service was exceptional. We were immediately seated and before we could even ask for a menu they were being placed in our hands along with our glasses filled with water. The server checked in on us while we were trying to decide and realized we were still discussing so discreetly stepped back to return as soon as she saw us out the menus down. This was all the time serving others as the place was rather busy. 

Out order was taken and within a very short time our meal was served. 

My partner ordered  a signature   burger with mushrooms , cheese , bacon etc. he enjoyed it very much. The burger was cooked exactly how he requested it. Although he said next time he would build his own burger and have a bison one 

I on the other hand had the sliders with tomato, caramelized onions and spinach.  Excellent

The real test came with the fries. To often fries a skinny and greasy. These were not. The fries were amazing they had just the right amount of crunch when eaten. Even better were the sweet potato fries. They were substantial and not limp and greasy like so many others I have tasted at other places in the past. 

Good place to go if you want a little more upmarket place"}
{"text":"I really hope Bluburger can weather through the rough economic times in South Chandler. I have been coming here since the staff was at the Kierland location in Scottsdale. 

We took some family here, and for whatever reason, they were disappointed. I think it was because they are Midwesterners, and like their burgers plain and simple. Whatever. Their loss.

I on the other hand, can appreciate quality bison meat on a gourmet onion bun. My favorite here is the southwest bison burger, with sweet potatoes and some extra chipotle mayo on the side. Flavorful does not begin to describe this burger. I can wolf it down quick! 

A gourmet burger starts off with appearance. I could see eating this burger in the same place I eat $50 steaks. When you take that first bite, the onion bun starts off as something familiar, yet lets you know something else interesting is on the way. The gourmet burger finishes off when the bun gets the hell out of the way, and ushers in the juicy bison, and the incredible southwest toppings. 

Who wants to meet for dinner!?"}
{"text":"Burgers were good, as were salads.Fried Zucchini should Not be on the menu, was Awful.
Good thing for our server Jen,that there were Eight in our party, that way she received a  automatic, 20% gratuity for poor service, and disposition."}
{"text":"Standard burger, good fries, okay service.

Tried out this place a few weeks ago. My parents and I did the Build Your Own Burger, which allows you to choose your toppings and sauces. I had the black agnus beef on whole wheat with onions, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle mayo. The chipotle mayo sauce was great, and the sweet potato fries were decent. The burger was nothing to rave about (although my dad said the kobe beef burger was pretty good). For the price and the quality, I'd look elsewhere.

We typically go to LushBurger on Pima near DC Ranch. Gave this place a shot, but I think we'll stick with LushBurger."}
{"text":"The burgers here are large and really good. Love the sweet potato fries, too. Now that Indulge Burger is gone, this place has stepped up for a build your own burger, which I think is reasonably priced, since it comes with a side. I guess if you want to go fancy, some of the burgers are pricey, but I'm happy with the selection you get to choose from. My only complaint is that while the servers are friendly enough, the service can be a bit lacking. We waited a long time to get our order taken last time with one poor girl trying to take all the orders (and get them right) while two other guys weren't doing much of anything other than sporadically deliver food. I don't know who designed the restaurant. I get why it's painted blue, but it's gotta be the coldest, most depressing shade of blue I've ever seen. If I were the owners, I'd change the color, even though I know it's pretty new. Maybe some art or something other than what they've got would help. But I'm there for the good burgers, so I'll just close my eyes and eat!"}
{"text":"Okay, so after a game of golf, we decide to chow down some burgers. We were told by the concierge to try this place and so we did.

Disappointment. Granted the fact that this establishment is in the heart of Scottsdale, which is known as high rent district with all the attitude of hoity-toity people. 

Hamburger/Cheeseburger and a side of fries for $12-$14 is outlandish. The fact that this restaurant had various choices in beer and wine rack shouldn't be the reason for such pricing. By the time the meal and couple of alcoholic beverages were consumed, average price of each person came to about $22 before gratuity. 

I suppose everyone has his/her own standard or benchmark. But $22 for a GROUND BEEF and 2 beer does not stack up well on price to value ratio. Either they need to improve their marketing by convincing the diners that, this is more than just a burger place or they need to convince the diners that they are eating something much more than a burger while eating a burger.

Meat was good, no flavour however and was not cooked to order; I ordered medium but came out well-done. The staff was good to excellent--good waiting staff, excellent bus staff. 

Everyone in the party agreed that, we could have had a lot more for what we paid; or reversely, we could have had what we had elsewhere for a lot less cost."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and since it was in walking distance, we decided to spring for an expensive burger. Was it worth it? Yeah, it was good, $12 a pop good? - Not sure, about that one. 

We had the habenero and American burgers. The only thing spicy about the hab was the jalepenos and the american had  Onion rings - were  hand made and quality. Taste was pretty good. It reminded us of the The Counter in silicon valley, but with a AZ twist. Service was really friendly. A little slow, but good. Actually only giving 4 stars because of the cost and the flies outside. They need a zapper or something, they were all over the place. Could have been the re-seeding of grass, possibly, but would have been beautiful out there without them!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Really not much more to say....but I will! All of our hamburgers were burnt and dry. Not good. The onion rings were tasty, fries were average and price was steep. You can \"build your own\" so that's interesting but it didn't matter what I had on there - it was burnt. 

We got 3 meals for $45 - oddly, there was a 10% discount for paying with cash."}
{"text":"My fiancé's mother and I both ate at this place and proceeded to spend today throwing up and otherwise incapacitated.  No one else we are currently staying with got sick, just the two of us who ate at this place.  We both had burgers and fries.  

I will not be back..."}
{"text":"Never again. This was a one time thing. Let me first start by saying the service was great, not flawless as we had to ask for drinks a couple of times before a refill arrived, but the staff was professional and nice. On the flip side of things their burgers were nothing special. I honestly would rather eat at McDonalds over this place. I had the Blu Burger and I was not impressed. Their beer selection is good and their French fry selection was decent too. I would only recommend going here if you are looking to eat quick (because the place is EMPTY) and are craving beer and fries."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in the East Valley.  SO many choices of meat to use(grass fed, kobe, bison, etc), buns to put it on, and even more topping choices!  My standard choice is a kobe burger, medium-rare, w/fried egg, bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, pickle, hot peppers, ketchup and mustard....with fries on the side.

This is definitely a \"sit down and dig in\" kind of place...so don't expect to walk in and order a cheeseburger and walk out.

Nice place, with seating inside and outside...and the place is actually \"blue\" with blue lighting when you walk in.  Staff is always very welcoming, and service is consistent.

This is probably the most visited burger joint I go to."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale location has since closed down and there is now one in the Park West area in Glendale.  I have been there 3 different times now and it has gone downhill each time.  I'm not sure what it is, but the quality of the food is not as good and I've walked away for the last time not wanting to go back.  It's just not the same as it was a few years ago."}
{"text":"A vegetarian who loves a burger joint?  Yep!  

Our group of 8 (including Matthew J.) headed here after happy hour.  I must admit, I was excited because it isn't that often that a new restaurant opens in Chandler.  We went in and were seated within 20 minutes - which was great because its not that spacious inside.

Everyone seemed to love their burgers, but I can't speak on those.  I ordered a grilled cheese, which I usually do at  \"American\" restaurants that provide vegetarians with only salads and maybe one other choice (boo...).   But, boy oh boy was this a great grilled cheese!!  It was more liked a toasted grilled cheese, because it wasn't weighed down by butter soaked bread like some I've experienced.  I even got to pick my cheese....yummmmyyy!!  I also ordered the Caprese, which was good.

Plus - to top the night off - gelato!  

It's great to have a new, hip (ish) restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers..love the spicy options. Have been here four times and the service has been good everytime..nothing like a burger and cold beer on a hot day!"}
{"text":"Went to Blu Burger after my son found the good reviews on Yelp.  Our family ordered the following: American Kobe, bbq burger, bison burger, salmon and a kids burger.  All the beef burgers were excellent.  The bison was not as juicy as the beef but I was okay with that since it's a healthier choice.  The salmon was disappointing as it was pretty dry so I would not recommend it.

We had fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings and a salad.  All were good and complimented the burgers as they should.  It would be good if they could come up with a good dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries.  Service was decent but not spectacular.  Casual ambience.

I will come back but only occasionally since it's a but pricey for burgers."}
{"text":"It's good, maybe slightly above average but still good. The menu layout and customization is interesting, but I honestly would prefer a few other places for a burger! You would think for a place that has 'Burger' in its name and exclusively serves burgers in would be a little better."}
{"text":"This was my third time here, once with old ownership and twice with new ownership. The place has really improved and according to the new owner Scott they have many more facility updates to come. 

The gelato was soooooo good!!! 

If you are looking for a quality burger try them out. They have a full bar and a huge patio for the area."}
{"text":"I called to ask if they had gluten free buns and the man who answered the phone had an Australian accent, he told me he didn't know if they had gluten free vegan buns, so I asked him if he could ask someone because he never offered to ask someone else to find out. When I asked him to ask someone else he said sarcastically\" who do you want me to ask\" I said \"idk just someone \". How would I know? I don't work there. Then he yelled \"DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH\"? Then he hung up. It was very disrespectful, and I am never going to come back. I just wanted to know because I have allergies and apparently that's to much to ask for at blu burger."}
{"text":"We live closeby so we go here fairly often. Service is prompt, food is great! Have tried most of the menu and like pretty much everything...Just as good as the Counter in LA.

Sweet potato fries are great, love the current 'holiday' pretzel bun burger too... Try them, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this place with my Family & Friends, BUT at least ONE thing is off every time I come here.  The consistency just isn't there.  The last time my bread on my burger was stale.  The time before that, the diet soda mix was off.  The time before that, my Mom's burger was over cooked.  I REALLY enjoy their food.  Their menu selections are REALLY unique.  However, the inconsistency tends to kill the unique culinary experience.  I will go back, but I will inevitably select other options first, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars on their burgers alone. I have found it difficult to find a good local burger joint in the east valley. I am a major fan of Delux in Phoenix but this place is just as good and a lot closer to home! My husband had the beef burger with the fried egg and chopped garlic and said he could eat that for the rest of his life! I had a simple beef burger with a wheat bun and a chipolte mayo which was amazing, but I can't wait to go back and try all their other sauces! 

The sides were just as good, and prices were reasonable. If you like gourmet burgers, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place had potential. Who doesn't like burgers, especially build your own burgers?! 

So I start this place at a full five stars. 

But it fell flat for me. 

First of all, this place is literally in like the middle of nowhere. 35-40 minutes from Chandler without traffic. So that was lame. But anyways! I ordered a Build-My-Own burger and asked for it medium and it was cooked well done and wasn't juicy at all. Which sucks cuz I want meat! Nice juicy man meat! Not hard charred burnt meat. 

But I digress, I had a burned up piece of meat with some nice mushrooms and onions but due to the burned meat and the overall lacklusterness of the burger, I shall subtract a star.

Four stars so far. 

However! The sweet potato fries with Herb Sauce was delish! I wish I had a whole plate of that instead. So I shall add a star.

Five stars now.

I also can't go without mentioning a drink. I had here signature Blu-Martinin. Which was indigestable. It was so nasty and strong and just awful. I told the waitress about it and she just offered to put ice cubes in it??? That did nothing but add ice cubes. Minus a star.

Four stars.

Ambiance was...interesting. The place was small and it was cold, and dark. Very  vampire-esque. And if you're a lady don't even try to walk to the bathroom by yourself. It's like walking down rape alley - there are no lights anywhere! Also the place like doubled as a gelato shop. So it's just odd going for a gourmet American burger and then being slapped in the face with an enormous selection of Gelato. I believe Hubert Keller would scoff. Minus a star.

Three stars.

Would I go back? Hell no. The drive isn't worth the sub par food. It's just a small little shop with mediocre food and bad drinks. So I'll opt out. And just because I left feeling so disappointed I'm dropping a star.

Overall - 2 stars."}
{"text":"I used to love this place .... until tonight. I was a bit taken back when the manager/bartender (?) on duty took a large spoonful of gelato & ate it behind the bar. That was nothing compared to what happened next. A young girl comes in with a rat on her shoulder & places a to-go order.  She then is allowed to sit at the bar with the rat on her shoulder, in her arms, under her hair. The staff on duty chatted to her about the rat so they were fully aware it was in the restaurant. At no time did any of the waitstaff ask us if our food was okay. (My husband's onion rings were cold.) I would have said something about the rat if anyone had asked about the quality of our food. I've posted pictures of the rat. While I love animals, a rat doesn't belong in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Never heard back from management.  Too bad.  I wish them well, but don't ignore the customers."}
{"text":"Ambiance-  It's BLUE. the walls, the ceiling, the floor, the tables, the chairs, the booths, and several of the glass windows.  It's dark and there is no where for the eye to rest. I found it very unsettling. I think they took the blue theme waaaaay to far. There is patio seating, so I would opt for that next time.

Service- our waiter acted and sounded like he would rather be anywhere else. Bored and lackluster- he seemed to just not care.  The busboy practically hovered over our table waiting to clear our plates while we were still eating. 

Food- Surprisingly the best part!  Despite the sad decor and sadder service, the burgers we ordered came out really great. Even my burger, which I ordered well done, came out very juicy.  

I feel bad giving this place such a low rating, but I can't condone service like what we received. The waitstaff needs to be more upbeat- they need to smile, and they need to have a better attitude.   And a little less blue paint would have really done them well."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing....

Went out last night for dinner and sat at the bar with my wife. Bar was 3/4 full, but got two nice seats at the end. Even with 3 people working behind the bar, it took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged. 

We both ordered  burgers medium rare - burgers arrived well done and tasteless. 

I don't mind paying $14 for a burger if it's flavorful & cooked properly. Unfortunately our meal wasn't even worthy of fast food prices."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.25 Stars. \"Ehh.\" That's about all the energy I can muster for this place. If BluBurger is really all about burgers, then they've got work to do.

What I Liked: It's blue inside.

Room for Improvement: Although the quality of the food seemed decent, the flavor wasn't anything to brag about. The burgers were neither huge, nor robust with flavor, nor memorable in any way. And that should never be the case if the word \"burger\" is actually in the name of your establishment. No, I should have been walking out, picking my teeth, and reveling in the magnificence of the culinary bovine creation in which I just partook. Instead, I was underwhelmed.

Overall: I don't think I'll be back. Without putting too much thought into it, I can name a half-dozen places I'd rather get a burger than BluBurger. So, I just don't see the point."}
{"text":"Groupon brought us in, good food brings us back. Order one of their signature burgers, or build your own. We've done both. The signature Blu Burger came exactly as described, and cooked to perfection (medium). The onion bun was fresh and the side of onion rings were great. To build your own, select your burger (beef, turkey, bison, chicken, veggie, salmon, Portobello....), select the bun (you can even get a lettuce wrap), cheese, toppings, sauces and any specialty ingredients (egg, guacamole, ham....). I highly recommend the Kobe beef; it was so flavorful and that will probably be a go-to selection in the future. Must say I'm not overly impressed with the sweet potato fries, though. Hard to find good sweet potato fries it seems. 

They do offer salads and sandwiches, but if they have \"burger\" in their name, you should at least try a burger. And with all of the options, why wouldn't you?

Family owned and operated - gotta love that! Fellow Yelpers, let's do our part to support family owned businesses! All in all, good food, nice staff. I recommend."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed another great burger at this location, we end up here once a month and never disappointed the burgers are great and service top notch, plenty of parking also generous cocktails that are made just right"}
{"text":"By walking in this evening, it wasn't very busy and was very cold... I thought that maybe we should head to pita jungle or a Subway instead, but omg I'm so glad we didn't!!! If you're not a fan of burgers don't eat here, but if you're in the mood for an amazing burger, salad, or just something hormone free- definitely hit this place up.  I ordered a basic sandwich and they put some amazing sauce on it.  Soooo good!  Kids portions are great and they have all different kids of fries.  
It was a little pricey for the type of place though. I would of thought with this amazing food that we would be eating in a nice restaurant, but it was more like pita jungle inside with amazing super high quality food; that's why I was confused.  
If they would show their logo and types of food outside with a little more marketing and nicer (darker and relaxed) inside, I could see this place being an amazing restaurant all the way around with people dying to get in."}
{"text":"Blu Burger is one of the last surviving restaurants in the AJs plaza at Chandler Heights and Alma School.  I fear that after AJ's closes later this year so will Blu Burger and good ridance.  
Our family is a huge Delux fan and I wish that Delux would come to the EV because the food at Blu Burger was mediocre.  I got the california chicken sandwich-which was overloaded with spices-no mention of spices on the menu and my husband had the build your own Angus burger.  He said it was bland.  They couldn't even get the sweet potato fries right!  

The kids mini burgers at $5 a pop were a total rip off.  If you are going to make food smaller then charge less.  I for one am tired of restaurants over charging on kids food.  

The wait staff was as bland as the food and they all looked and acted like they couldn't wait until closing time. 

Don't think I will be visting Blu Burger again!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. So I've only had the turkey burgers and grass fed beef burgers and its either been awesome or just ok. I think it's fantastic they have grass fed beef and hope to see more places following suit. So like I said, I've had the t-burg once and it was ridiculous good and another time when it was meh. The build your own burger is a sweet option allowing you to um, build your own burger. Plenty of sauces for the patty, I recommend chipotle mayo or roasted red pepper mayo. And Monday and Tuesdays are half price bottles of wine and they actually have a strong selection of vino including caymus and Faust. Overall I like it and have been here a few times and plan on returning. Just hoping for a bit more consistency."}
{"text":"We loved it! Sure Groupon is the reason we went and still spent alot, but it was tasty and the service was friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"3-3 and a half ... Closer to 4 than three ... Ok ... 4... Had the habanero burger and onion rings.  Loved it!  I would go back just for that.  Loved the grilled flavor on the patty."}
{"text":"Kibe beef burgers are seriously the greatest burger I have EVER SHOVELED INTO MY MOUTH ?"}
{"text":"Went with my son last night. We both had bison burgers.  I had field greens, tomatoes and caramelized onions. My son had cheddar and bacon. I really wanted to love it and it was good, but I wouldn't call it great.  I can't say there was anything really wrong with it, it just wasn't as wonderful as I was expecting for a $14 burger.   They zucchini fries actually out-shined the burger though it struck me as a little odd that they couldn't find something nicer than a plastic soufflé cup in which to serve the ranch dressing.  I really wanted to love this new addition to that shopping center but I'd probably choose Pita Jungle over Blu Burger the next time I'm eating there."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times. It's been excellent every time. Servers are all wonderful and so nice. The classic Blu Burger is excellent!! Would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Blu Burger yesterday. I ordered the chicken pear salad. My sister in law had the cobb salad and our husband's had burgers. They loved their meals. My sister in law said the sweet potato fries were the best she ever had and both guys thought their burgers were great. My salad was \"decent\". It was HUGE. And the goat cheese was in giant chunks. so if you got a bite of it you were eating an ounce at a time of cheese. Hard to taste anything else. The chicken was dry and overcooked. the dressing was really good. 

They are getting a two from me based on my food only and on the service. When we got there they had a total of about six tables. Our waiter had the demeanor of a guy who'd rather be anywhwere else. He told me they \"ran out of coffee\" this morning meaning \"I don't want to make any\". 45 minutes after ordering I went and asked where our food was. By this time there were three tables in the place and our food still did't arrive for about ten minutes."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time because the first was so great!!

Once again we both got burgers. This time I tried the turkey burger with onion rings on it. It was delicious!!! We got the green bean and sweet potato fries again because they were so good last time. We also tried zucchini fries this time and they were good! I would say the green bean fries are still my favorite though. 

We really enjoy the food here. The only downfall seems to be the slow business. Both times we have gone it has been pretty empty in there. It would be more enjoyable to go if it was more upbeat and busy in there."}
{"text":"First time here and my husband and I both loved our burgers. We chose the build your own burger option and has the grass fed beef, bacon, cheese, lettuce, and avocado. The burgers were very large and we honestly should have just split the burger in half! We got the regular and sweet potato fries and they were both so good!"}
{"text":"MMMmmm, burgers!  Cooked perfect, great serivce, lots of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"They have changed the bread on their chicken sandwich, it's no longer a bun but regular sandwich bread like you would get at home.  Very disappointing. But their fries rock!!"}
{"text":"Incredible burgers. But not quite worth the price tag. Someone needs to explain to me how a burger can cost as much as a steak..."}
{"text":"Blu Burger is what all trendy burger places ought to inspire to be. Bison, Kobe, regular beef, chicken, fish and vegetarian options, plus dozens (if not hundreds) of bun, topping and condiment options that allow each burger-phile to create their own masterpiece on each and every visit.

In addition, the ice cream and handmade shakes are fabulous, too -- as are the sweet potato fries and, my favorite, the zuchini fries.

With no two burgers alike, you're going to wait 20-minutes-plus from the time you order until your tables' food arrives. Possibly longer if they are packed. But the wait is worth it, and if you're not enjoying the company of your dining companions in the meantime, enjoy great bar drinks, awesome original art on the walls, sports (generally) on the televisions, and great upbeat ambience that makes it a fun restaurant to visit.

Btw, there's a contest for all you creative types to come up with the Burger of the Month, which they'll promote and serve... and give you credit for, if selected. I much prefer to design my own, but some of the winners I've seen have looked mighty tasty!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Mouth-watering burgers. Now, I'm probably biased, since I've only ordered the one burger (3 or 4 times), but what can I say? It's delicious.

Build-your-own Burger: Kobe beef burger, onion bun, provolone cheese, herbed mayo, garlic, lettuce. Me? In paradise!

Now, that would be enough for me to rank this place highly, but add to that the awesome sides... Onion rings are delightful; crisp, thick cut, battered rings. I almost always order the zucchini fries to go with my burger, though. So, so good.

The staff is friendly and usually fast, with an eye on your drinks, too. For the money, it doesn't get much better. I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Small quaint atmosphere is pleasant. The food is another story! The turkey burger is a generous serving of a frozen pressed piece of (turkey?) served on plain toasted sandwich bread. The lettuce was so little, a scant. The zucchini fries are awesome!

When the waitress asked how it was I was honest. She came back with a beef burger which I was very surprised with. The burger is a generous patty served on plain toasted sandwich bread and again the lettuce was a scant. 

The iced tea my friend ordered was forgotten and had to asked for again. 

The price is a rip off for what you get. I paid $15 and change for my burger, zucchini fries and water.I know this is Scottsdale, but still disappointed.

Over all, totally disappointed! I have no desire to try this place again."}
{"text":"Overpriced burgers in a strip mall.  3 burgers and 2 lemonades for $75.  Burgers were okay, but not even close to being worth the $18 price tag.  Average ambiance and 2/3 empty on a Saturday night at 7 pm. Highly recommend Rehab Burger (Old Town Scottsdale) A Zinburger (Scottsdale Quarter or Cartwright's (downtown Cave Creek) for great burgers."}
{"text":"Been watching this place under construction and I am not disappointed. Had a turkey burger on whole wheat, swiss, tomatoes, dill pickle, chopped garlic with chipotle mayo.....yummy!! For sure try this place, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in during the lunch rush on a Thursday with my mom and little sister.  They love the place... my mom is always raving about their blu chicken sandwich (avocado, lettuce, bacon, tomato, swiss & herb mayo) and my sister loves the blu burger (caramelized onions, gorgonzola cheese & bacon).  I was playing vegetarian the last time I was in town so the bluburger grille didn't really appeal to me at the time...

Thankfully, the vegetarian thing was just a phase and I was ready to say hello to meat again.  I decided to build my own burger... ordered American Kobe beef on whole wheat with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onions and bacon w/ herb mayo.

Delicious.

One of the best burgers I've had... but I'm not sure if I'd be willing to pay the $14 again.  The service was horrible... I understand being swamped but the guy disappeared.  I'm only knocking down one star for that.

Sweet potato fries were awesome as well.

I'm a fan, for sure."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try with friends tonight, and it was tasty!  It's a choose-your-own-adventure food place, with a nice variety of ingredients, friendly service and a cute atmosphere.

You choose a bun, \"meat\" (they have lots of meats, but also salmon, veggie patty and portabello mushroom), cheese, toppings and sauce.  They also provide a side with the meal, which is really nice.

I had the portabello mushroom  in a whole wheat bun with goat cheese, spinach, tomato, avocado (slight upcharge) and BBQ sauce, and it was delicious!  Feel free to get exactly the same thing - you'll be glad you did.

My husband ordered the veggie burger with buffalo sauce, goat cheese, pickles and some other veggies.  I stole a bite, so I can tell you the veggie patty was clearly homemade and very smooth and flavorful.  I got the skinny fries (good but not outstanding), but my husband's sweet potato fries were really tasty (I swear I let him eat most of his meal).  

Our friends really enjoyed their meal, too.  They took advantage of the gluten free bun option (so great to have that available) and chose  zucchini fries, which were thick and soft in the middle with crunchy breading - pretty interesting and tasty.

Overall, a nice experience.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The owner is a cheap arrogant bastard. He used to encourage cash only, that means he is scamming . How is he in business?"}
{"text":"The new owners are making a lot of changes to change the dining experience. The wait staff was friendly and helpful and the burgers were delicious. They also have gelato for dessert. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not only does this place have a great wine and spirit selection but the burgers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Perfect bison burgers!!!! Great place to eat. Me and my wife will definitely be going back to try something else."}
{"text":"Favorite things about Blu Burger:
+ locally owned!
+ grass-fed beef option, perfectly prepared
+ portobello mushroom, chicken and salmon \"burger\" options
+ fresh, fresh plentiful fixin's, DIY
+ romaine lettuce wrap \"bun\" option - listed right on the menu!
+ friendly, helpful staff
+ patio to enjoy for our 300+ days of outdoor dining weather in AZ

Not-so-favorite things:
- atmosphere is, well, !!BLUE!! - but aforementioned patio is not
- comparatively expensive, but you get what you pay for
- lunch menu prices and portion sizes are the same as dinner

In sum:
= totally worth checking out"}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers and large! Love the decor and atmosphere. One of my favorite local places to bring freinds and family!"}
{"text":"Awful will never return. Burger was edible but in no way tasty... fries were not edible. Very old fryer oil that needed to be changed weeks ago was used to cook my fries. I am appalled that these jokers cant even make an order of edible fries. Do not waste your money or time here. To the owners of Blu do us a favor.. shut the doors.. stop serving up this awful food to your elderly customers. You should be ashamed to own this business. I read the bad reviews and tried it anyway.. mistake.. the bad reviews are right."}
{"text":"Yes, the burgers aren't cheap, but it's the best burger around.  The only better burger I've had is The Counter in LA.   BBG makes your burger as you ordered it, and offers a great selection of toppings.  Fries are even included in the price!  I always stop by when I'm in town visiting relatives."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered the Bison burger. What a pleasant surprise! The burger looked and tasted great. Awesome selection of gourmet toppings and cheeses for the burgers and they are NOT small!"}
{"text":"Bison burger is the best! Tonight on a whole wheat bun, romaine, red onion, goat cheese, chopped garlic, grilled pineapple, dijon and relish. Nom Nom Nom!"}
{"text":"Geez so many poor reviews! Never had a bad experience here. I hadn't been for a while but came here last week and I thought it was pretty good. It is pretty small in there but nice. 
Our service was good. The kitchen forgot a few things but it wasn't a huge deal. I ordered a built your own veggie burger with sweet potato fries as my side. The ciabatta that my veggie burger came on seemed like it was starting to get a bit stale, but was toasted to mask that. It wasn't bad, but not the best. The veggie burger was yummy, I got it with goat cheese, spinach, tomatoes, onion, and avocado with thousand island dressing on the side. Wasn't my #1 favorite veggie burger but I did like it. The fries were fantastic! 
This meal was very expensive though. We definitely could've had a better quality meal for less money. But oh well, not bad Id come back!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Especially when having out of town guest coming with their dog.  The outdoor patio space allows for dogs.  We often go during \"happy hour\" to enjoy the half price Milkshake.  The burgers are delicious with a huge variety of make your own burger options.  Only CON for me is price.  Service has always been good and the place has always been clean."}
{"text":"I had a basic cheeseburger medium rare and a salad with blue cheese. The salad was fancy lettuce and cherry tomato sliced in half, no croutons, cheese, cucumbers etc. Very boring. The Blue Cheese was equally as boring. The burger looked good from your table but was sver cooked, no flavor to the meat and boring as well. The bun and the veggies were good, but who cares. Service was mostly alright nothing bad. The BAD part was getting a bill for $15 for a burger that was slightly better then 5 Guys Burgers. Not going to come back unless someone else is buying."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!  This place is absolutely off the charts good.  The price is a bit high for a \"hamburger\" but don't use that word.  This is a masterpiece!  Service is outstanding and very family/casual.  It feels like the staff has been my friend for years even though we just met.

Atmosphere is GREAT
Service is GREAT
Appetizers and Sides are GREAT
But most of all the burgers are so good you can't really call them a \"hamburger. It's heaven between a bun!

Outside patio is a wonderful place to watch the sun go down with your favorite beverage and then nosh on some heavenly food."}
{"text":"We love the Blu Burger!  We just ate here again tonight, and were very pleased as usual!  The burgers are quite large, made to order and delicious!  The staff is fast and friendly.  I recommend this place to all our visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"I been here many times . Most recently about a week ago. The burgers and fries are delicious . Everyone is very friendly . I have tried most of the burgers and they are all so good . I'm planning on taking my friend here since he loves burgers . I'm sure he will love it . Give it a try you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Expensive but good burgers.
I came here with a group of 8 from my office the other day and I enjoyed my burger here.

It was my first time here but others have been here several times and they liked their food here.

I ordered Mediterranean burger, simply because it was made with grass-fed beef. Ordered medium rare and meat came perfectly cooked. Very good flavor, good burger for sure.

French fries portion was small, I tasted zucchini fries and sweet potato fries from others and liked zucchini fries the most.

Two ladies were working on the day we visited and both of them were helpful and friendly.

It's a quite way up north after getting off the freeway, and burger was expensive. Not sure if I would drive up here again just eat lunch here but if I happen to be in the area, I would consider as a choice of places to eat."}
{"text":"I was going to put 3 stars just cos of the super slow service/cooking time (even if I'm the only one in the restaurant), and I ordered to go. The lady was super nice, but the guy didn't greet me or anything, figured out he was new since he made a couple of mistakes on another to go order on the phone. Anyway, been trying to eat here for the longest time since I live so close. I tried their BYOBs (Build your own burger). So basically, choice of meat, bun, sauces, add ons etc. I had their Portobello Mushroom(WHICH WAS AMAZING,hence the additional star) on wheat bun, Pepper Jack cheese, Lettuce,Jalapenos, Mixed greens, Pickles and tomatoes with Habanero Sauce and Herb Mayo. . And their french fries are crispy but not oily which was a major plus. Will go back here, sure, when I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"Service was great but we were also the ONLY ones there on a Friday night so it better be.  We got there around 7:45 and not one person ever came in after us, was odd.  When I got home I checked to see if they closed at 8pm as I was still in shock. I asked our waitress, who was really friendly, why nobody was here as it was creeping us out, she said they had celebrated their 6 month anniversary the night before and were slammed.  I get that, but not sure if that should mean on a Friday night you do $55 worth of business after 7pm.  Anyways, can't complain about my bill being $55 for 2 cheeseburgers and 2 beers, I looked at the menu/prices before I showed up so I knew what I was in for but not sure how anyone would go a 2nd time.  I have no problem paying that much but for that price I would always try someplace I have never been before as there wasn't anything that would make me want to go back.  Burgers were fine, beer was fine, service was great but value really isn't there.  For 17 bucks I need to be wowed if I'm paying that price for a burger.  Beer was great but for 7 bucks I could go anywhere else and get that \"special\" price.  If you have never been there and don't mind spending $50 bucks for a burger and beer check it out.  Just expect to say, not bad just not worth the price."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the service here, the staff was unfriendly, and didn't even acknowledge us when we first walked in because they were too busy watching tv.  The burgers were awesome however."}
{"text":"This place was good; food was good.. a bit overpriced in my opinion for a burger and the service was good so nothing to complain about there. I would recommend it , just be prepared to spend a bit more than a normal burger... even though its good quality , I still think its overpriced"}
{"text":"The Bison Burgers are something that's out of the norm for bugers in this area especially.

The atmosphere is very... blue.

And the food tasted eh... OK enough to eat but I don't know if I'd be going back anytime soon.  There just was nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"Lived out here for almost two years and finally tried this place...can't believe we waited this long, it's amazing. BEST burger we've ever had. You can build your own burger which is easy and you get exactly what you want. We did ours with the kobe meat and it was delicious. The buns were even great. The burgers are huge and fries are good too. They have a nice little outdoor patio, clean/simple/modern decor and a friendly staff. Yes, it may be a little bit more expensive than the average burger place but you get what you pay for. This is a gourmet burger. I'd rather spend a few extra dollars and get an awesome/huge burger than spend a few bucks and get a dinky/tasteless burger. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I am a local and have eaten at  Blu Burger regularly over the years. The interior is really in need of a renovation........dark, gloomy and waaaay to blue! The waitstaff under new ownership is a real improvement.....friendly and relatively attentive. However, the food tonight left much to be desired. Everything I was served was luke-warm. Seemed like the buns had been toasted ahead of time , as they were pretty cold and a bit hard when I picked up the burger. The burger itself was well-done even though I had ordered it medium-rare. It was without any natural juices......cool, dry and a bit  tough for a burger. The zucchini fries I usually order were of the same quality. The breading was without crunch and they were cool. The taste of oil was overpowering, even though the fires themselves were not oily. I will say that I have never had this kind of meal before at Blu Burger and I will write it off as a very busy Saturday night. I was a disappointment and not a cheap one. I will give them another chance because it is a local spot I would like to support. Hope this was simply a \"one off\" for them."}
{"text":"Being invited to dinner one doesn't have the privilege of choosing the spot so Blu Burger Grille seemed an ok spot to join out of town guests. WRONG...Before I arrived I checked the site out and was disappointed to read an awful review but I went with an open mind.  I arrived before my party and walked into the grille to check it out.  I had to take a step back from the scent of fried oil or so it seemed. The grilles sq. footage is small with patio type tables and booths.  The host or cashier greeted me (chewing gum) and told me to take any seat I liked.  I opted for the outside patio while waiting for my party.  No one even ventured out offering me water nor did they take the time to clean the tables covered with grease. Finally 15 minutes into my wait a server  came out and asked if I wanted a drink. (Maybe he didn't see me at first). With water and a menu before me I browsed to see my options. The menu, original and entertaining, offered Step 1-6 Build Your Burger, clever \"Lettuce\" build your burger selections, salads, sandwiches and sides. Well guess what, my dinner companions call and ask where I am.  Yep they picked Blu Burger Grille but at The Summit and thank goodness for change of venues.  Like night and day, so was the Blu Burger at The Summit.  Yes the menu was the same as were the booths and chairs but that was about all.  The Summit was clean with a fabulous stocked bar and excellent service.  My burger topped with mushrooms, onions and gorgonzola cheese was perfect.  The sweet potatoe fries crispy and tasty.  If you are craving for a burger try BLU BURGER GRILLE but at The Summit."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend. We wanted to go to someplace that was different and not a big resturant chain. Myself and my friend were really happy with the resturant. You can build your own burger and decide what you want to put on it or not put on it. My friend got a burger and I made a salmon burger. They only messed up one thing with my friends meal but overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for quite a few years. I used to love the BLT but I recently went vegan and I'm disappointed that there is literally nothing on the menu for someone of this dietary restriction. Service is always been good and I do love sitting on their patio. Unfortunately tonight there was an awful smell much like sewer. If you don't mind meat this is a great restaurant. They also serve gelato which I haven't had in years so I can't give it a current review but it used to be delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, have on occasion had issues with the service.  One of the best burgers in the valley, customers select their patty - Kobe, salmon, chicken, portobello available as optiona, bread, cheese, and customize their toppings.  I have always found their patties tender and juicy.  

The first time we went to blu burger for lunch, it wasn't very busy, but our waiter ingnored our table the whole time to chit-chat with a co-worker.  After receiving our check, I waited approx 10 min for our waiter to take my credit card.  We also went to dinner on a Tuesday night at 7:30 and were told that they were closing the dining room and only taking to-go orders.  In the time that we waited for our food, the staff turned away 3 other couples.  Kind of weird to close down at only 7:30?!?!, we took it as a sign they might be going out of business soon.  Ironically, the service is much better when it's a bit busy.  The staff doesn't feel that it is worthwhile to take care of their customers when there's only a few tables.

I hope Blu Burger makes it.  The food makes it worthwhile to go.  It would be a shame if the staffing/managment issues put the restaurant under."}
{"text":"Been here several times and have yet to be disappointed with the food or service.  Tonight I had the kobe beef with brie, mushrooms, and truffle aioli and it definitely hit the spot.  The onion rings were also quite nice, and a tasty Victorian IPA washed it all down.  Glad to see some good bottles of beer (Dogfish Head, Odell's, etc) on the drink menu and the wine list has some nice wine selections as well.  I really can't understand all the mediocre reviews of this place as it's one of the better burger places around here and while not cheap, I don't think the prices are out of line for the quality and the fact that it's N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time Saturday, had a great time, sat outside. The burger was phenomenal. I had the \"build your own\" w/ green chile, carmelized onions wheat bun and the works - could not have asked for a better burger. I chose the regular meat, no upgrade, but it was great. The zuch fries are ok but the green bean fries are amazing. Dipped them in the chipotle mayo. I would give 5 stars but their normal fries were actually pretty average, but that is minor. It was all about the burger and I was happily satisfied."}
{"text":"I keep on coming back here. This is our 'let's go grab a burger' place. Best burgers in Arizona...easily. And they use healthier meats.(personally I believe this is why the burgers taste better) Again best burger place !! I'll keep on going back for the grass fed burger and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"We were totally bummed when we missed happy hour by just a few minutes, but this place was still a winner.  Happy hour ends at 6pm BTW.  I was impressed with the craft beer selection here.  I had a firestone DBA Amber and my hubby had a Founder's brew.  We both built our own burgers, and with the help of the server, decided not to go with Kobe beef.  She said Kobe is the best if you like your burger medium rare.  I don't like my burger moo-ing at me, so I went with regular sirloin, which was still totally tender and juicy.  I love the range of topping for the burgers and especially the many different sauce choices since I am a true sauce junkie.  The also have the choice of a buffalo burger (although it is the most expensive of them all) which is a good healthier option.  We both got side salads with our burgers and they were huge and were more than just lettuce, which made me happy."}
{"text":"We come here ofter, I don't recommend the bison burger but I can highly recommend the turkey and the angus burgers. I get worried they won't last long since it never seems real busy but the veggies are fresh, the have a great balsamic as well as special sauces. All wonderful with a good beer. Cheers"}
{"text":"On paper everything looked great: grass fed naturally raised beef and good ingredients. Unfortunately they didn't execute on a good plan.

I ordered the American Kobe beef burger medium-well with fries. I'm not sure I received the Kobe that I ordered because two thirds in it became apparent that it was well done. It was nearly burnt to a crisp and not just around the edges as I had thought. The fries were passable but mostly forgettable.

The service was okay at best. After we ordered we were passed off to two second stringers that were entirely uncoordinated. We were asked at least three times if we needed a box for leftovers, which each time we answered yes.

The interior has a lot of flat surfaces so it gets really loud in there. This is not a good place for groups larger than four people. Any bigger than that and people at the end of the table are essentially lost, unless you like yelling at each other but that only makes the problem worse."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch recently and sat outside.  There were only about 8 other diners in the whole place, and we were the only ones outside.  The table was filthy and I had to ask the waitress to wipe it down.  My husband and I each had the Kobe Beef Burger with swiss cheese,  \"sauteed mushrooms\",  cooked \"medium\".  I had a side salad and he had zucchini fries.  I had a wine and he had a beer.  The first negative was the CANNED mushrooms on the burgers; not even sauteed canned mushrooms!  Second, both burgers were closer to well done than to medium.  Third, they were neither juicy nor tasty.  Fourth, my  \"salad\" was nothing more than some lettuce and a few cherry tomatoes.  Fifth, our waitress had the personality of a rock.  Once she delivered our food, we didn't see her again until she delivered the bill.  She never even asked us if we'd like dessert or another drink!  She had an attitude from the beginning, when I asked her to wipe down the table.  Sixth, I do not believe any restaurant should AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDE GRATUITY!  No wonder the wait staff there have no personalities.  The word \"gratuity\" comes from the Latin word \"gratuitus\" meaning, \"voluntary\"!  To automatically include gratuity is presumptuous and brazen.  Our bill came to $50 for 2 mediocre burgers, a \"salad\", zucchini fries, 1 beer and 1 glass of house wine.  I can think of many other places where I could spend fifty bucks and get a much better burger with much better service!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the valley. Period. We've been going here since they opened and service is still great and food is even better. This is a must try. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Just OK,

 I live really close and have been there twice since they opened and let me tell you I love hamburgers. Let me say again, I have been there only twice. 

The tried the Grass feed beef and one time I tried the Kobe.Had a side salad which I did not enjoy at all but the burger was alright. I wasn't excited about the Kobe. I have been to Japan and had Kobe beef. I don't think it should be made into burgers. I wasn't all that excited either about the list you get to assemble your burger. It was like a pre-flight check sheet for a 747.

Like I said it was OK, not knock your socks off."}
{"text":"I've eaten at BluBurger Grille on North Scottsdale Road at least 3 times. Each time has been a good experience. The food quality is high. Yes, it's an $11-15 burger but it is not \"pink slime!\"  

Tonight I had a grass-fed Angus beef burger with goat cheese and caramelized onions sans bun. Perfect for a grain-free diet, cooked perfectly, perfectly delicious.  Also had a really quite good glass of Mclaren Vale Shiraz, so I can't complain!

Service was prompt and friendly. We sat outside and had a nice view of the mountains during sunset. I guess the few crummy Yelp reviews aren't hurting them too much as it was a full house on a Thursday night. Those of us who keep going back need to share our satisfaction with others."}
{"text":"Overpriced Mediocrity:  location will keep this place is business through the summer but only because the options in this area are so very few.  The menu is not worth the bold pricing.  Save the money and drive 4 miles south on Scottsdale Rd to Cold Beer & Cheese Burgers.

Setting: Blue paint everywhere but like a frat house basement rather than a swanky destination.
Service: Inexperienced wait staff and clearly the kitchen as well.

Drinks/Food:  here's the real killer....  wife and I each spent considerable time reviewing the menu.  The cocktails are uninspiring in both their descriptions and ingredients.  The beer list is a tour of boredom.  Nothing in the drink category would make Blu a destination.  In an era of spectacular microbrews and small-batch distilleries, here is a great opportunity to shine with very little effort.

The appetizers are the standard boring fare.  So standard that you may simply skip them.  Fries, truffle fries and onion rings are all the quality of the free lunch program at an elementary school cafeteria.  I say \"free lunch\" because they are so bad that all four tables in the restaurant that day at lunch loudly complained and had them taken off the bill!!!  My wife ordered a medium rare beef burger off their specialty menu.  Her burger was called the Habenero Burger and while it had the requisite heat, the medium rare order was delivered as a chalk-like well-done.  Two bites and the burger was left on the plate to finish it ongoing death.  I, myself, ordered a Build-your-own burger.  Trying to emulate the Pittsburger from CBCB, I ordered a beef patty (med-rare) with slaw and a fried egg on an onion bun.  The patty was again well-done and very dry, the slaw lacks depth of flavor and the classic runny egg was like a flattened version of a hard-boiled.  The bun was fresh.

I thought this may be a one-off bad day but reading other reviews it is becoming quite clear that if the owners take any pride in food, they will tear the whole menu down, hire a chef and brighten the space.  Staff is in desperate need of training, particularly efficiency. This stretch of N. Scottsdale Rd is prime for a reliable sit down lunch spot.  It is surrounded by a great deal of expendable income but this restaurant in its current state is a far second to even the quick food court at the Target next door."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but tasty.  I don't eat red meat but have ordered the chicken burger and/or veggie burger which have both been fine.  The sweet potato fries were my favorite of the meal.  Think there are better options."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Their menu is awesome! No matter what you order it is delicious! A must try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Greeted at the door with a warm friendly smile. The friendly hostess showed us our choices of tables and a booth and asked which we preferred. We went straight to the comfortable booth - available even though it was peak dinner time on a Saturday night. They were busy but have plenty of seating inside and out. We LOVE not having to wait when we're ready for eat. 

Warm friendly server. I had the grilled shrimp martini - huge, fresh shrimp. Better than any I've had here in Scottsdale. Surprised since it's a burger place and I was initially hesitant but the server suggested it. Uniquely interesting cocktail sauce, in a gourmet chef kind of way. Delicious. 

My husband is the burger expert and he loved his. I have to say burgers don't interest me but I tired it and couldn't resist. Tasty onion bun, grilled patty and whatever that sauce - delicious.    

Everything from the shrimp to the salad was fresh, fresh, fresh. Several staff continued to check in on us while eating- more sparkling water?, Can I get you anything else? Would you like more bbq sauce? (He noticed we were running low?!) 

In summary- if you're looking for a friendly, casual, nice place to have great food definitely go. Glad we did. We'll be back. Well run restaurant with delicious food. To the owners: \"well done\". My hat is off to you."}
{"text":"Been at BB 4 times
Wow
Great Chow!!"}
{"text":"Where's the beef?

Decent decor - although the Muhammed Ali theme was a bit odd - even though the booth seating pleather was starting to crack.

Food had some promise, but the bun on my burger overwhelmed the meat and the other players. And I hate that. If you get a burger, get it w/o the bun. Sweet potato fries were pretty good. 

Not the most family friendly place either. Want a good burger? Save yourself a lot of money and just go to Five Guys or In-N-Out."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic. We had Hummis appetizer which was very good. The waitress was very helpful in explaining the menu. I had a chicken burger that was off the chart good! Next time we are in town we will be back. Some of the burgers are a little pricey with all the add on's but worth it."}
{"text":"Had the American Burger and the Chicken Sandwich with my wife. Almost, Maybe, Probably the Best Burger I have had.

Go and don't hesitate."}
{"text":"Under new management!  My husband and I went there today.  We had a fantastic meal there.  The burger was delicious and the truffle fries were to die for.  I'm not big on burgers but this one rocked!  The owner came by and made us feel so welcomed.  The next time I'm craving a burger, I know where I'm going!!!!"}
{"text":"Just finishing dinner here and I'm currently relishing in the afterglow of a food-gasm!  Seriously, I think I just had the best burger of my life!!!  This place has so many options...you can choose from one of their many specialty burgers or you can build your own.  I had the grass fed jalapeño burger wrapped in lettuce to save some carbs!  Honestly, I didn't miss the bun at all and actually thought the flavors of the meat and toppings were spectacular!!!  The burger was perfectly cooked!!  My hubby had the Blu Burger and I swear I saw his eyes roll up to the back of head.  So many sides to choose from...we had a nice salad and if you can't decide between the zucchini or sweet potato fries, they will gladly mix both for you to enjoy...and, oh, were they ever enjoyable!!! I wish I got pics but sadly I didn't.  I guess you'll just have to come here for yourself to enjoy the fun atmosphere, full bar, and the most amazing burger of your life!!!  And PS, if don't eat meat...there's lots for you here too!!!"}
{"text":"Will not visit again. Stood at host station waiting to be seated for several minutes while the \"host\" cleaned and set 2 tables. No acknowledgement, no offer to seat myself until I walked up and pointed out that I was interested in becoming a paying customer. With some annoyance, he indicated \"sorry, but I'm just really busy\" then said I could sit anywhere. I chose the driver's seat of my car, and selected a competitor."}
{"text":"I love a good burger and with that said Blue Burger Grill has become my favorite place to go for a good burger. I love that you can create your own burger with as many toppings as you like...mine always end up being messy but good! My boyfriend and i have been here numerous times and always leave full and content. The staff is friendly the service is quick. The sweet potato fries and the zucchini fries are to die for! The chocolate shake reminds me of the shakes I used to get at my favorite custard stand back home...cheek sucking thick and YUMMY. If you want a good custom messy burger...Blue Burger is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Maybe this place should change their name to Big Burger because these suckers are huge! And oh, so tasty.

The boyfriend, his mom and I went here on a Saturday afternoon. The place is not very big and was about half full but we managed to snag a booth. We all ordered burgers of course although they do offer other sandwiches and salads.

We all chose the build your own burger option, boyfriend and I going with grass-fed and mom going for the bison.

I went pretty standard on mine - American cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mayo on a white bun. Like I said earlier the burger is huge and they do not skimp on cheese. (yay!) I cut it in half and dove in. The meat was cooked really well, just a little pink and was super cheesy. The bun was fresh too. From the first bite to the last it was a wonderful, messy, delicious experience. Boyfriend and mom agreed between burger-filled slurps and chomps.

One thing to note, these burgers ain't cheap. They start at around $11 and go up from there depending on what kind of meat and topping you choose. But it does include a side, so there's that.

I would definitely go back here to stuff my face with a sloppy burger and fries again. Yum."}
{"text":"Kristen and I stopped here on a whim, we were just hungry and had no idea where to go, and essentially we thought the sign looked cool. 
Bluburger is pretty great, our waiter explained the process they use, choose your meat, bread, toppings, sides, all that stuff, then a few minutes later you have a delicious burger in front of you. I had a black angus burger on a wheat bun with goat cheese, caramelized onions and chipotle mayo, holy cow, I can't wait to have that again. Kristen had some kobe beef burger that was also amazing, The regular fries and sweet potato fries were both very tasty and we had some great service. They have wonderful milkshake options too. 
I hope Bluburger lasts and is able to branch out to Tempe, with solid food and great service, it would be happily welcomed."}
{"text":"We go to this place all the time, usually take friends and we can tell you that no one that has eaten here has complained about the food.  It is the opposite, everyone goes crazy  for the food.  It is fresh, minimally processed food and the bugers are served on the best buns i have had in Phoenix.  The beer is cold, the service is excellent and the interior is attractive.  Easily one of the best burger places in Arizona and the only knock on the place, it can be expensive but no worse than any of the other high end burger places in town that are nowhere as good as this.  Give it a go."}
{"text":"Poor service, staff is older & acted put out
by us.  My burger came out well done and when I had the manager over to explain that I had ordered medium, he took a look at my burger and tried to convince me that it was indeed medium.  I guess I'm an idiot, because that's how the guy was trying to make me feel! Regardless, very subpar place.  I do not recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tuesday is the day to go.  Went here for a random and quick lunch and I was pretty happy with the Turkey burger.  It was charred just enough and the toppings are pretty decent to choose from for a custom burger.  I was a bit disappointed with the onion rings because they came out as a clump and really oily.  Service was good but I was waiting for a few moments extra for my check and napkin folded on my plate.  The staff is really knowledgable and friendly and I'll definately check it out again for a lunch.  The atmosphere is kind of diner style meets a cozy kitchen.  I'm a fan and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Best burger I have had in  a very long time!  I had the grass fed beef with sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, jalapeños (which were fresh not canned) and thousand island!  I can't wait to go back and have this burger again!
Has good selection for kids and great service too!"}
{"text":"Since it's close to the house, I thought I'd give this place a try.  Tried an Angus burger and the wife had the sliders.  The food was in a word mediocre.  I've had much better burgers in a lot of places that made lots of other things besides burger.  The sliders were pretty bad with thin tasteless meat.  The prices are high as well.  Oh well, on to the next joint. Only if Delux could branch out to Chandler..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and it was not busy at all...  Borderline - dead.  Service was average to bad and was distrbed to see how one of the managers treated a vendor that was making a delivery or trying to collect money.
The lunch was very average and as a business man, was not impressed with the service or the business tactics I observed.

I will not be dining again and would not reccomend to my friends or associates - Good luck William."}
{"text":"A close neighborhood spot for us, with really basic but yummy food. We always bring our 2 year old and she loves the food, too. I go for a basic grassy fed burger usually and my husband and daughter love the bison burger. Definitely get the Parmesan fries, the regular ones are kind of boring."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced, mine was okay but it made my boyfriend feel sick.  Our actual waitress was good but another girl that worked there came over to our table numerous times and proceeded to flirt with my boyfriend right in front of me!  Not overall the best experience."}
{"text":"Their burgers are pretty incredible as are their truffle fries we love eating take out from this place... I highly recommend them !!"}
{"text":"Burgers were standard.  Service was sub-par.  I won't go back again.  Nothing really great about the experience at all.  Burgers weren't that tasty."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place for a long time. The building from the outside give the appearance that it looks nice on the inside.  I know it is call the Blue Burger  Grille but from the minute I walked in the door my eyes started hurting me.  EVERYTHING IS BRIGHT BLUE: Bright Blue Walls, Blue Concrete Floors, Blue tables, even blue lightbulbs.  It immediately turned me off.  Atmosphere is part of the dining experience and this place was definately lacking on the atmosphere.  It cost us 72 dollars for 5 people to eat and we only ordered 1 soda. That would have been OK if the food was amazing, but everything came overcooked.  We ordered everything medium rare and it came medium well, I didnt even bother sending it back because we couldnt wait to out of there and get away from the obnoxiously overwhelming blue  interior decor"}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars for the amazing burgers you will get here, but the service is a 2. It's unfortunate but it seems you can't get the best of both worlds here. Once, when we dined in, we sat at a table for four (it was just the two of us). Even though there were only two other customers and the manager confirmed they weren't expecting anyone at the time - we were asked to move to a smaller table, \"just in case\". After that we started taking our orders to go because, really, the burgers are THAT good. However, 4/5 times our orders were wrong when we got home. It's a shame that the service was poor. Although we remained customers while they were at the Hayden location, now that they've closed and moved... we aren't bothered to follow them."}
{"text":"Would hardly call this a \"joint\".  It is well appointed, artistically decorated ,and highly priced.  Lunch for a friend and I topped out at $36 including tip.

Burger was perfect.  Bacon perfectly cooked, great bun, tasty beef.  Good all around, and the sweet potato fries were excellent.

Not sure I am committed to $18 for lunch anytime soon again.  But it was delicious."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Had the Blu Burger $12 and other guest had the Blu Chicken Sandwich with Zucchini Fries (very hot and yummy)$11.  They were very busy and service was very disappointing. No water, had to ask bus boy,  no check-in on how the food tasted and had to request check twice. Maybe it was challenges of fine tuning a new resturant.  Do not sit in the last table next too kitchen, there is way too much foot traffic and noise.  

We will go back because the food was so excellent and the price was perfect,  but never during rush hour (6:30pm on a Saturday night)."}
{"text":"Some guy who sounded like he was Australian picked up the phone and was so disrespectful. Used to love this place but will never go again."}
{"text":"The service and food was very good.  I had a pear chicken salad that was fresh and tasty.  My husband said his hamburger was good."}
{"text":"Have had several great burgers here and the wine list is amazing however the reds by the glass are too warm. Visited this week and not only were the burgers sub-standard the server added $1 tip to BOTH our checks and after almost 24 hours they are not responding to email complaint."}
{"text":"I want to love this place as it is so close to home but the staff is rude, orders are always wrong and tonight my dinner was freezing cold."}
{"text":"Incredible burger. Cooked perfectly. Mega juicy. Fries were ok - not a big fry snob."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I like Blu Burger.  I have been to another several times and really liked it.
This one, however, has no vibe.  I have never seen it full, in fact, I'm not sure I've ever seen it half full, which seems to be telling me something.  
I do enjoy the food and think they have a good beer selection, (love the Sex Panther), but again, this place feels cold and unaccommodating.  When it first opened we came here at least twice a month, now we go once every other month.  I do hope something changes."}
{"text":"New owner and goodness what an immensely improved experience!

Night and day difference to say the least. 

We are happy we gave it another try, it's now our preferred burger place. 

If this spot turned you off in the past, think about giving it another try too :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the Scottsdale Summit location.

The first time our family went there was when it opened and while the food was expensive for burgers, it was the owner who I wasn't pleased with when it sounded lie he was offering free ice cream, but in reality he was getting them interested to ask their parents.  This left a bad taste so after a couple of years we returned 2 weeks ago.

The service was terrible.  Even though there were only 5 tables being served, the waitress was more interested in wiping the bar and folding napkins for the next day then waiting on us.  The couple of times she did come to our table, her attitude was negative we couldn't wait to leave.  

We will never return there."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers i've ever had. a lot of topping choices and excellent sweet fries. only downside is this place cost me 25 bucks for a burger and a beer, but then again the area that its in can justify the cost. I actually like the Ali theme as i know he lives in Az and this area is really nice makes u think he might just walk in. If u got the extra money to spend this place is well worth it."}
{"text":"All the blue color is a little overwhelming, but the burgers are delicious and the variety is good.  I like being able to build my burger from what kind of bun that I want to whether it's a turkey, beef, veggie, etc., burger.  Great for a Saturday afternoon place to gather with friends, plenty of parking and I enjoyed the Muhammad Ali memorabilia and photos decorating the restaurant."}
{"text":"On the plus side....

I love being able to fully customize my burger.  You are given options for each piece - type of meat (regular beef, kobe, buffalo, turkey, veg, etc.), buns  (whole wheat, kaiser roll, etc.), cheese (blue, cheddar, swiss, etc.)  veggie toppings and condiments.  One never knows day to day what one would crave, so it's great to be able to mix it up.

On the downside...

Every time I have ordered a burger medium rare, it has ALWAYS been undercooked.  Not a problem if I'm in the restaurant, but I often grab takeout, so once it's home and covered in my nifty personalized toppings, I'm kinda stuck with a rare burger.  And when I say rare, I mean you can see the mushy fibers of the meat/fat.

I do love the flavors of the burgers and if sweet potato fries is your thing, theirs are very good (the thin cut, skin-on kind).

I think if you order your burger one temp up from what you want, you can have a really great meal.  And though the burgers are pricier than places like Red Robin, it's a much bigger burger, so the value is there."}
{"text":"Great food. The atmosphere is a little uncomfortable but the zucchini fries make up for that. I had the BBQ burger and my boyfriend had the bison burger. Both were cooked exceptionally although it took quite a while for the food to be done. 

Groupon usually has specials here so I'd definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"We used to eat here a lot but won't be going back...I ordered the salmon Caesar salad, she brings out the greek salmon salad, I said that's not what I ordered so she proceeds to say I thought it was, no it wasn't... so she brings out salad no dressing on it, REALLY, she was too busy talking to the table behind us about mascara, that is sooooo important, instead of your tables. Now we know why there wasn't but two tables with customers there."}
{"text":"Great Place for casual dining!

Choose your own everything (Meat, Cheese, Bun, Toppings, ETC).  Food and Service is always great!  Ive been here about 10 times in the year ive lived in chandler and its always good.  Have nothing bad to say!  Not sure how the lady below (sara) has that opinion about the place.  I could only imagine being married to that!!  They serve burgers and beer....how is it possible to mess that up?

Highly recommended for casual dining if your in the mood for Burgers!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today with my family and I must say, it was pretty darn good. We ordered the Angus beef burgers. The beef was great quality and cooked perfectly medium rare. I liked how you could pick everything you wanted on it. The fries were crisp and tasty. I ordered a salad instead of fries with my burger, and it was fairly large. I can't say I loved the ranch dressing, though. 

Yes, it's a tad pricy for burgers, but not ridiculous. They were really good burgers too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places with a wide variety of heart healthy burgers and an additional selection of other items on there menu. I was impressed by the good quality service, even when the resturant was full, they managed to keep our drinks filled and our orders came promptly."}
{"text":"I hate eating hamburgers BUT.. this place is great.  Free range,  grass fed beef burger.  Amazing!  You will not be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"When I visited, it was like a ghost town here. Unless Scottsdale is like my sleepy hometown of Irvine, CA, where nobody is really out past 8pm, then I have no clue why there were 0 people here. Odd.

Anyways, I ordered up a Kobe burger and the onion rings, hoping that a large amount of grease would line my stomach and keep me from feeling sick. That's the type of thinking you have when you have no medical training whatsoever. 

Anyways, I scarfed the food down, and it was pretty decent. Award winning? No, not quite. But it was a pretty sizable meal and pretty good quality as well."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for a build your own burger I recommend this place. High quality produce, reasonable price and you can get vegetarian, low carb, and non-beef options. My go to is an Angus burger cooked to order and served wrapped in lettuce or a bun with chipotle sauce, roasted chilies and goat cheese. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Good burgers - not terribly special. We ate a Kobe Beef burger and I guess it was pretty tasty. People will compare this place to Delux and to be honest, I don't really think that place is all that special either. You can get a better burger at Z Tejas or even Big Fat Greek. 

We also had a chicken Caesar salad and I thought it was decent... again, nothing terribly special. They have funky silverware and glasses - which is neat. I also kinda liked the diner atmosphere. 

I thought the service was fine... VERY attentive on drink refills, but they weren't that busy. I think for the prices, they could offer cloth napkins. Speaking of which, the prices here are a little steep for a burger, but not too far off what you would expect when you're already thinking of Delux. I'd say to compare the two is like comparing apples to apples and not being able to tell much of a difference. Gun to my head, I'm choosing Delux, but only because you get more fries and it's closer to where I live. My actual first choice would be Z Tejas though."}
{"text":"Habanero burger ftw!! it's just so uncomfortably blue in there. I dont understand why they chose to design the building that way...at least leave the windows clear ya know? Despite the literally sickening atmosphere, the food is pretty good. The meat is cooked to order, the sauces are distinct, and the sweet potatoes fries are pretty bomb. Overall, I think its a good place for burgers...just would sit outside if i could next time."}
{"text":"My quick summary:  Sky's the limit with burger invention and fresh ingredients.

I absolutely love Blu Burger.  I've always found traditional burgers so boring.  Blu Burger is my burger mecca.  They have too many ingredients to list (meat types, bun types, toppings, sauces, etc), so you can mix & match, combine, and taste test to you heart's desire.

The staff is friendly, super attentive, and quite charming.  There's never a long wait for anything.  And they really treat you like family.  They will work with any request you have.  I wanted to try a couple different toppings & sauces to find what I liked best.  So, to cater to my known insanity, they brought everything out on separate little plates & bowls for me.  I settled with goat cheese & green chilies on a black Angus burger on a whole wheat bun.

The burgers are always cooked to perfection.  They have options for meat lovers & vegetarians alike.  The fries are always crispy & delicious.  Their side salad is always super fresh & crisp.  They're even kind enough to bring the dressing on the side, so it's never a case of no dressing or drowned in dressing.

A am now a proud regular & will not be leaving any time soon."}
{"text":"No way around it: this place is overpriced. From the menu prices to the plate-splitting charges to the extra ingredients to the sides. Food itself it good not great.

Blue Burger confirmed to me that they use specials and happy hours when they first open to generate traffic, but take them away once they hit the critical mass they want. So don't get to hooked on anything you like about these places."}
{"text":"Went early on a Tuesday. They just started a special-$3 drafts Mon-Weds. And they have a great selection of beers on tap.

I have to say, the atmosphere of this place needs help. All the blue was a little too much. 

That being said, the burgers we ordered were very good. I had the BYOB with Bison, onion bun, sharp cheddar, red onions, jalapenos (fresh), dill pickles, herb mayo, and mustard. The only complaint I have is that the bun was way too big for me to get a bite of the entire burger, but I was willing to let that slide. I got the sweet potato fries, which were good. 

My husband ordered the slider sampler, with the Blu burger, California burger, and BBQ burger. All were very good. Also got the zucchini fries, which were very good as well.

We are ranch snobs, and I think their ranch here was lacking, but that is just a personal taste.

All-in-all, very good burger. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"For my first evening in Arizona (after driving here from Los Angeles) my friend suggested we go to the Blu Burger Grille.

We sat outside and watched the Sun setting.  I had the Blu Chicken Sandwich which is similar to a Club Sandwich but made with chicken rather than with turkey. Like a traditional Club Sandwich, the Blu Chicken sandwich had two, rather than three, slices of toast.  The Blu Chicken Sandwich was very good and I hope we can come back to the Blu Burger Grille again soon.

My friend had a Blu Burger with caramelized onions.  She decided caramelized onions are now her favorite thing to add to burgers.  She ate half of her sandwich and ate the other half today.  She also had a Blu Martini, one of her favorite cocktails.

Her son, who is sometimes a picky eater (as are many teenagers) had the Spicy Shrimp and ate the whole thing (plus some of his Mother's fries)."}
{"text":"We are always looking for  a \"better burger.\" It's a scenic drive up Scottsdale Road at sunset, so we took a chance, based on some positive reviews we'd seen.
     The menu was great, allowing you to choose the type of meat (Angus/Kobe beef, turkey) or portobello mushroom burger. Then you add exactly what you want from condiments to bacon, jalapeños, sautéed onions, etc. Next you choose the side dish---everything from a salad to different kinds of fries. So far so good.
     So, the food came and because I LOVE a great French fry, I try that first. They are cold (and a little underdone)!!! I then cut into the burger, planning on taking half home (so I don't pork out). I had ordered it medium, which means some pink in the middle. It wasn't exactly piping hot either.
     OK, bottom line is this burger is just not worth $12-$16 (plus toppings). The place was almost empty when we arrived. It was filling up as we left, so maybe they just got busy and let our order sit long enough for the food to cool off before it was served. 
It was a nice drive, but an overpriced, cold meal. We will keep looking for a \"better burger\"..."}
{"text":"Average burger, I got three sliders. My girlfriend loved her Blu Burger and gave it four stars. The atmosphere is very relaxed and there weren't many people in there. I probably wouldn't go back since there are a few other burger places around, plus five guys is just as good."}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite spot. Unique burger options, crispy hot fries and a wine list to go with it all. Last time we were in there the new Manager remembered which wine we drink. So impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Been here several times, food & service have been consistently good. They tend to overcook burgers so watch how you order. Family friendly and nice size patio, too."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and ordered the black Angus burger (which was $10). It's cool that you get to pick everything from the bun to all the toppings you want. The burger was pretty good and the service as fast and friendly. 

However, the overall atmosphere of the place seemed boring... everything is just blue (which is cool if I was a smurf but it seemed to be missing some character. I guess I'm looking for some wow factor when I spend $10 for a burger."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go to Blu a lot for lunch! We are addicted to the food. Their burgers are so awesome! They have a huge variety of different types of meat anything from black angus beef to bison. The burgers are fantastic! Now for your side... Try to zucchini fries YUMMM! The way Blu is decorated is pretty cool, offers an interesting dining atmosphere. The staff is always super friendly as well! 

The only \"negative\" things I would say is sometimes there are not enough servers on to accommodate the busier times and the service suffers a bit. The other staff such as the bus boys and managers do help out though. Also, it is a tiny bit pricey. I will say that the quality of the food does make it a go to place! I highly recommend trying Blu out if you are in the mood for an AWESOME burger in a super cool environment."}
{"text":"Blue burger is back in Peoria !!! Across from AMC cinema in Parke West shopping complex"}
{"text":"Received a coupon from the owner the last time I was there for a discount.  
Ate a chicken sandwich and cole slaw  and was over charged more than the discount. DUH!  won't t be backl"}
{"text":"I am afraid to say it's over between us, Blu Burger. I did love you in the beginning, but I can't handle the poor service..especially considering the price. I had a bad experience over the summer, but we decided to give it another try last night as some of the $ went to our local school. When we arrived it wasn't too crowded, but we did have to sit on the patio as its pretty small inside. I asked them to please let me know when a table opens up inside as it will be cold once the sun goes down (and my daughter was getting over strep throat) Why they have no patio heaters??? is beyond me. I would think they could spring for a couple with the prices they charge for a hamburger? really?   We ordered asap as we know what we get there (though the grass fed has been off the menu since late spring?!?). And we wait. and wait. and wait. And other people are moved inside to tables that open up? and we wait. and our waiter never comes back? not once. When he does come back outside - he takes food to another table and doesnt even look our way. So...40 minutes later, no food, no inside table, not even a \"do you need anything\" - we packed up and left. I have NEVER left a restaurant in my life, but I was just completely ticked off at the service levels. So, sorry Blu Burger, you just blew what used to be a regular customer...family of 4, a couple of extra kids....usually $60-70 check."}
{"text":"really great food and great menu as well
staff was really kind and helpful and there was a good atmosphere in general
overall it is one of the better places in the area."}
{"text":"We orded this as take out so I can't speak of the service.  I have to confess I don't eat burgers often and was intrigued by some of the healthier options they offered at Bluburger.

I thought my burger and all the options in ordering was above the average and really good.  I had opted for a the healthier bison burger lettuced wrapped and I loved that I had the option to do that.  My burger was juicy and very tastey.  I ordered all the fixings I liked and opted for the suite potato fries, which were great in my opinion.  The only thing that I did't like was since it was take out my lettuce wrap got a little soggy but I think it was not due to the establishment but the ride home. 

My husband had the skinny fries with the Angus Burger and he was pleased with it.  I tired the skinny fries and they were really good!  

This is definately a gourmet burger place and you pay extra than the norm for the options of higher quality meat and a variety of toppings.  I like to have these choices and felt it justified the cost but if you are just looking for a good basic burger there are other places out there."}
{"text":"Bluburger Grille, it's really blue inside and out. I am a fan of this establishment because their ingredients are fresh and delicious. I chose the option to build my own burger and I was completely satisfied with my creation. I chose to create a portobello mushroom burger which I had never had before but I thoroughly enjoyed. They also serve sweet potato fries which is an extra bonus."}
{"text":"I'm actually not sure how this restaurant is still in business. Other than no other restaurant with burgers being nearby. We started with the Hummus and Pita plate. The waitress brought out dirty appetizer plates, one with hot sauce stuck to it, and the other had guacamole stuck on it. How do you not consciously notice such disgusting dirty plates??  They obviously do not care. 
I ordered a salad which wasn't good. I ordered what they call \"Parmesan Truffle fries\" on their menu, and anyone who has ever had these fries anywhere else has a conception on how these fries SHOULD look and taste. The hostess came out with fries that looked like they were from an Ore-Ida frozen bag with a small amount of shredded Parmesan cheese on top. She didn't even bring ketchup, and ran away before I could ask for some. They also tasted the same as how I have described them. 
My child's Penne Alfredo was gross as well. I didn't even have a chance to say anything because the waitress wasn't even attentive, and the hostess was serving us. I was also charged for an Iced tea that we never ordered, but I didn't dispute it because I wanted out of there quickly. They really need to get it together, or they will go out of business or be shut down by the health department.  Anyone would hope they do before somebody gets food poisoning.  Unacceptable and nasty!!"}
{"text":"Pregnant and craving a veggie burger, came here for dinner with DH. Really liked building my own burger and they had a lot of nice topping and dressing choices (there was a lame weekend when I played Papa's Burgeria, the kids Flash game and I totally had memories of it!) 

I liked that their veggie burgers are not oily, and you can really distinguish the veggies and beans and such, rather than a flat dried out starchy burger. Sweet potato fries on the side and a cookies & cream milk shake were awesome, and were the right portion sizes though I'm pretty sure I'd have gorged on more. 

For an occasional calorie bomb treat, this is perfect! Prices were perfect too! And the menu was simple and stuck to burgers and diner fare. They are so close to me, that I don't have to think twice about where to head when I crave such food. I only wish they were open late (don't you always crave these foods around midnight, maybe a vestige from college days?)

ETA: They did add an automatic 18% gratuity, which I thought very odd. However, we had a wonderful experience, attentive servers and the atmosphere was casual without being too trendy or hippy, so we had no problem with it."}
{"text":"It's hard to give 5 stars to a burger joint - but I thought about it.

My only expectations were \"expensive\" as I had read something about a place with gorgonzola topped Kobe burgers.  I also didn't know if it was sit-down, counter service or what.  And does the \"next-to-Barcelona\" rub off in any good/bad/ugly way ?  

Bottom Line:  A pleasant surprise!
Clean, quick, quaint but modern.  And it is sit down service provided by a friendly staff.  Polite.  Not overly professional but that isn't a bad thing - they sell burgers  .... and sorry to use the phrase but what a burger.  Perfectly cooked.  Anointed with my selections of fixings - most as part of the price - and choice of buns (including wheat).

And what *seems* expensive at $11 for a half pound Kobe burger ($8 for Angus half , $6 for Angus quarter pound), they serve bottomless drinks at a reasonable price ($2), and cheese, veggies, special sauces for covering your burger and a side dish were also included (best sweet potato fries I've ever had).  So in fact the net result was in line.  

While I didn't have any, they also have Crab Cakes, Turkey Burger and an Organic Veggie Burger --- so plenty for lite to extreme veggie crowd! Salads and sandwiches all in the $5 - $8 range were also available --- but that's for the 4th or 5th visit.  

It's a nice little corner cafe --- good for a quick but tasty bite at lunch, or even a leisurely afternoon (Quality beer on tap and it even looked like martini service - but no I didn't indulge ;-).

And did I say my burger was near perfect?
Cheers"}
{"text":"Very good burger joint! Service was good and food came out pretty fast. Patio seating was decent but the tables were a little too close to each other. 

The food was spectacular! Went with my girlfriend and we both built our own burger. I got an angus beef burger and she went for the turkey burger. The selection is nice for building your burger, there are lots of different cheeses, toppings and sauces to choose from. We both thoroughly enjoyed our burger. The sweet potato fries were delicious and zucchini fries were even better! Overall, very impressed and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such bad ratings. I've eaten here a bunch of times with my family and every time has been delightful. I love how you can make your own burger and put whatever you want on it, the choices are endless and are great for picky eaters! The menu is fairly big and all the choices for burgers are delicious looking! The prices aren't bad either, every time I have gone here the service has been great. Fast, friendly and not expensive! I definitely recommend anyone who wants a good burger to come here!"}
{"text":"We walked in without waiting on a weekday at noon. I was a little surprised by the small size and the décor of the restaurant. Nothing negative, just not exactly what I had imagined after seeing trendy looking photos on Yelp. Menus were laid out on the tables. We selected a table and our beverage order was promptly taken. Already I'm comfortable that this is a place where you can eat a nice lunch and make it back to work on time. 

Our server passed when invited to make a recommendation, some more help would have been appreciated, so we simply went with the first two \"Signature Burgers\" listed on the menu. I know, we're disgracefully unimaginative! I ordered the Blu Burger, menu item number one, and definitely regretted not ordering the American Burger, menu item number two, when they arrived at our table. The American definitely had the stronger visual appeal. The Blu Burger was tasty, however, especially the caramelized onions. The buns not only looked great, but were soft and delicious. Other ingredients all seemed top notch. 

The cost of our lunch seemed very reasonable given the quality of the food, but a little pricey given the ambiance of the restaurant. Our tab, for two burgers, two sides of sweet potato fries, one ice tea and one water, was $28, not including tip.

I've never really embraced the gourmet burger fad. That said, it speaks well of the Blu Burger Grille that I'm anxious to return and try it out again. Next time I'll be ready to flip the menu over and customize."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger joint with the fancy look. I had the angus burger with egg on it. It is big but a man like me no need to slice it when you are suppose to grab it whole and eat it. The zucchini fries were good. They also have drink specials like wine, mix, and beer. The service was good and friendly. Maybe I will try their sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"Environment:
Located in the upscale area of chandler this place has a trendy setting. Its blue and inviting for trendy families looking to spend big bucks on OK food small tastes of food. limited seating and during busy hours will get you either a bar or outside seat. We sat the bar.

Service: 
Initial walk-in we were greeted and waited on with friendly staff, with no seating left we sat the bar. If you are a costumer service snob then this is not the seat for you. Through the course of our meal, we could hear every thing going on, which as a customer I don't need to hear a loud discussion about why a person is getting so much ice cream and the response be like \"well they paid a high price for it and im giving them more then one scope\", which gives the vibe that this place is very cheap on their serving sizes for the amount you paid.

Sitting at the bar also, the staff uses my dining space as a prep table, as they take out scopes of ice cream. Almost felt like cough on the ice cream to see what the staff will do, but dont worry i didn't

Food:
Its build your own burger, the kobe burger was decent but i had much better at other grilles. and my wife had a melt sandwich which was also very good. However they are an a la carte, which we both ordered fries, I ordered the sweet potato fries and my wife ordered regular fries. For the price I think i counted like 12 fries total on each of our plates. I think for that size it should be provided with the burger. 

Afterwards, im a sucker for milkshakes, and they were cheap on the ice cream, i could definitely tell there was quite alot of milk in the drink, tasting like a fast food shake.

Overall: I was not wow'ed by the food or the settings. The burger was decent but not decently priced for the serving size or taste."}
{"text":"Despite very bad lighting and decor, the food is exceptional and the wait staff very appreciative.

My wife is the harshest food critic I know, and if she says the food is good, then it is.  She loved her Bison Burger and Onion Rings."}
{"text":"Came here today for a late lunch to check off another burger place off my list.

Now I'll start off with having a really nice server and a really nice, if blue, atmosphere. I had decided to ride my bike there today, to work off the burger pounds I'm probably putting on, and they let me take it inside. The place was mostly empty, but still a really nice gesture so I didn't have to leave my really expensive bike outside. They filled up my water really fast as well and were very attentive. 

Strange thing was that I seemed to get served by 2 people, so they both asked me the same things one after another. 

I ordered the blu burger ($12) and can say that it could be a lot better for the price. The toppings of onion, bacon and Gorgonzola cheese were really tasty and savory. Mine didn't come with an onion bun that I could tell but still was a really nice bun to eat. I think that bun might be the best one I've had so far during my burger adventures.  

Unfortunately, the meat patty was extremely underwhelming. I don't know why they bothered asking me how I want my patty done (medium) because the thin ~1/4\"  patty was well done yet still lukewarm. There wasn't much texture to it either. 

These things are really expensive too!  Usually this price will get you a burger and fries at least, but it costs something like $5 for fries. That's the price of a burger and fries at some other places. 

I'd be curious to try their kobe patty to see if it was any better, but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Truffle Brie Burger is amazing! Yummy sides especially the sweet potato fries.  Make sure to try the salted caramel gelato.  Our server Brandon was very attentive and friendly.  You won't regret trying this place! It was worth the drive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch today with a good friend and client.. A great place for hamburger lovers! All of the burgers are custom made, Kobe beef is available too! I enjoyed an veggie burger with a lettuce wrap that was delicious. Sweet potato fries were excellent! Service was extremely good and I would definitely return. Patio seating was a plus."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents who happen to live in Cave Creek. They were going on and on and on... and on about it, so the last time I was visiting (and was promised free dinner) they suggested we go here. 

Upon walking in, I wasn't very impressed. Very small building, kinda dark, and everything was blue (duh!). Also, it smelled like cooked eggs! Not like sulfur, but like cooked scrambeled eggs?

However, it was crazy busy! I immediately saw that they serve burgers made with buffalo. I LOVE BUFFALO. So, I got a little excited.  My parents told me that the \"Blue Burger\" was bomb, but, the menu clearly states no substitutions for specialty burgers. Aw man!! Cause I was really wanting the Blue Burger at this point, which comes with angus beef. Techincally, I could have \"built my own\" blue burger, but it would have cost about $17 dollars which is just silly! So I sucked it up and ordered a non buffalo meat Blue Burger. (with a salad instead of fries, this was the day after Christmas so I need to cut back on the calories!)

The burger was delish!!!!! So good! Oh, and they ask you how you want it cooked. I got it medium rare, and it was perfect!  I will definately come back here when I get the chance! 

It would be rad if they could update the specialty burgers to have your choice of angus beef, grass fed beef, buffalo, or veggie. Then Blue Burger would be with out a doubt 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Groupon told me about this place. Went in expecting some upscale experience, but it wasn't close, especially considering the prices. In hindsight, In-n-Out is good enough for me! The place is overwhelmingly blue, no surprises there. The walls, ambient light, floors, tables...everything is blue. Not that  mind. What I care about is the food, which came on time, but was remarkably unremarkable. I got the Blu Burger, medium-well, with lettuce and tomatoes and cheddar, and a side of zucchini fries. The bread was cold-ish, and the patty was  sorta charred at the edges. And I got just two slices of tomatoes in my burger! The fries were good, but served in a small bowl, with a watery ranch dip. My friend got a Kobe burger and sweet potato fries. Nothing remarkable on his plate either. The bill came to $30 with tip, which I thought was pricey for two medium-sized burgers. But apparently they do good business. On a Saturday night, around 7ish, they were almost 90 percent full.  Give me In-N-Out anyday!"}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a hamburger place, but I CRAVE their portobello mushroom burgers - no, it;s not a BEEF burger smothered in mushrooms but a marinated portobello mushroom which takes up an entire bun and then is topped with the most mouth-watering choices.  I keep it simple...grilled onions, gorgonzola cheese and chipotle mayo (the mayo is also a great accompaniment to the sweet potato fries). I honestly get cravings for this.  My friends usually get some form of beef burger although salads and most recently a pasta dish was ordered.  There have been NO food complaints on any of these occasions.  My only frustration (grumble grumble) is that it closes at 8 on the weekends!  I consistently see people turned away.  Training people to dine here earlier or just losing money and potential repeat clients?...hm...When is enough business enough?"}
{"text":"Poor draft selection and nothing like the other location on Hayden (now out of business).  Food is just ok, on par with other Bluburgers, and service was a tad slow.  Parking is good though and the place was upbeat and clean."}
{"text":"My family and I were staying in the area and in reading recent reviews decided to stop by.  We had an excellent meal and the new owners took the time to come and say hello as well as follow up to ensure everything was good.  I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"So Amazing OMG!!! I made the best burger and it was so satisfying, i really wanted to try the zucchini fries but i decided to get regular fries with chipotle dipping sauce mmmm, next time i am definitely going to get zucchini fries as a compliment to these awesome burgers!! Great food at a decent price!!"}
{"text":"Must try the green bean fries!! 
The atmosphere is a little \"blue\", which takes the experience into the quirky rhelm but it's decent. The service was top notch and fast. My only complaint would be the skill level of the cooks, either my burger sat to long under a lamp the over cooked my food (which no self respecting owner would ever admit to) or my burger was cooked well beyond medium to begin with. Eh? Either way.. It was tasty, I'd try it again!"}
{"text":"Ok, in the burger department they are two stars at best.  You can't swing a dead cat in West Chandler these days without hitting a new gourmet burger joint. I think I prefer Smashburger, Coal Burger or even Habit Hut to this place and they are all a bit cheaper and a much closer to my house.  And we experienced the same issues with the service as the other reviewers.  Whoever that twenty-something dude is with the sandy blonde hair, someone should fire him because he definitely does not want to be there.

What earned this place the extra star is the following:

 1 - Their fries are fantastic.
 2 - They have portabello mushroom \"burgers\" that actually taste good.
 3 - Goat cheese. Yum.
 4 - They have a modest selection of microbrews, incl SanTan, my fav local beer
 5 - Milkshakes are only two bucks during happy hour.  How awesome is that?"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised this place doesn't get better reviews.  I've been here many times before and it has always been an awesome experience.  The food is DELICIOUS... truffle fries, OMG!  I am now what I call a cheating vegan/pescatarian.  Basically, I eat mostly vegan except I do eat seafood and I don't require something be perfectly vegan to eat it.  If it has a little milk or cheese in it, that's fine.  Took my daughter here for lunch a few days ago and she got a fantastic burger w/the truffle fries.  I got the calamari.  I tasted her burger and OMG... so good!!!  Everything was absolutely fantastic.  Our server was very attentive, friendly, and accommodating.  And, this has always been my experience in the past.  I love the build your own burger option.  I'm pretty sure if you wanted to be completely vegan, you could order the veggie burger on a lettuce wrap.  Anyway, such a great place, great people, great food.  Don't let the negative reviews turn you away.  I've lived in Cave Creek for 16 years and this is one of my favorite restaurants.  And, I have many friends who also agree.  My only wish is that they would stay open later, at least on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the appeal is here.

Food was ok, but nothing that justified the prices.  Quality wise a certain hamburger chain from Cali produces a burger just as good, if not better, at about a third of the cost.

This is one of those places with high ceilings and exposed industrial cooling ducts which I expect is supposed to give the place a certain \"look.\"  Ok...that's nice but if you don't dust and clean all that stuff it starts to look reeeeeaaaaallllllyyyyyy baaaaddddd.  Moreover when I see dust/web chunks the size of a quarter hanging from the chain that suspends the lights I keep waiting for one of those dust/web chunks to detach and land in my food.  Note that the menu has all kinds of up charges for more this, extra that...I didn't see one for the dust/web chunks so I expect if you get one in your food its free.

Nothing special, I've tried it, won't be back."}
{"text":"Blu Burger was very good.  My burger was cooked perfectly - did the build your own and it was great.  The sweet potato fries were really good....will be back to get more of the fries!!  All 4 of us ordered a different burger and everyone was very happy with the quality and taste of their selection.  The waitress was vey nice and provided great service.  I was a little disappointed in the drink options - no hard cider and limited ability to make mixed drinks.  I ended up with a margarita which was fine (made with a mix)...definitely nothing special.  It would be nice if they improved that side of their menu, at least include one hard cider offering for those that are gluten free."}
{"text":"California burger was excellent. Service was very good and the restaurant was very clean and cheery. They even have outside seating. It was a little pricey for a burger but I would return to have it again. It would be nice if they expanded their wine by the glass selection. If you come for lunch you're not going to buy a whole bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant recently. Beautiful setting but . . . the burgers are overpriced and underwhelming. The buns on the sliders and regular burger were dry. Grilling the bun is a nice idea but burning them 
is not.  So, left the buns behind and ate the Angus beef. Attentive staff but we won't be back."}
