{"text":"My favorite wings in Durham. About 40 sauces and rubs, all of them are winners. Mags Montreal style is fried, sauces, rolled in a steak spice and then blackened over the grill - must try."}
{"text":"Really good local stop.   They had a steak and pint special that sounded good so I gave it a spin.  Pretty good dinner for $12.  Veg meat spuds and beer!   Folks working the joint were friendly and included me in the hockey talk.  Highly recommended for a good local stop if you are traveling to the atea on biz like I was."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this simple and to the point. In the last 10 years I have been to McGwyers a dozen times. I'm an out of towner and I go there to join my brother in a friendly cheers-like environment.  The first time I went he said that I really had to try the chicken wings, and he was absolutely right. As far as wings go they are absolutely fantastic. A decade ago if you asked me if I'd be writing a review on chicken wings I would have asked you to give your head a shake.   Honestly, these are consistently the best wings ever. Here's the trick, whatever flavour you order make sure they \"grill\" them after they cook them. Do yourself a favour and take the mystery out of ordering. Just ask for \"hot grilled\" wings when you place your order (not too hot, but lots of flavour).  I have brought a couple of friends with me over the years and we all agree that if you're looking for the best wings ever and a cold pint, this is the place hands down.  Enjoy....I'm sure you'll agree."}
{"text":"Tuesday night, wing night. The best in Durham region mmmmmmmmmmmm. Get there early it's fills up"}
{"text":"best pub i have ever been too.  never had a bad meal or something i didn't like yet!  service is usually perfect, even when its super busy.  you guys are awsome here keep up the great work team."}
{"text":"Really good wings, great staff, good place to hangout with friends and family. Best in Durham region. Go there almost every Tuesday for the wings night."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars for their wings and service. I finally made it out for their Tuesday wing night and enjoyed two flavours of delicous wings! It was really busy and I can see why. We were a group of 6 and had to wait for a bit for a table. Service was great even though it was busy. Lots of flavours to choose from, I went with creamy sriracha and honey chipotle bbq. I ate them all, they were so good! It was my first meat meal in awhile too and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to play baseball for this bar I love Tom and I love his wife they have expanded the bar .... Now when you comin you don't feel like a can of sardines but I will tell you first time back since I've been in Florida and it took 3 tries to make me a BLT on rye now my girlfriend ordered a hamburger with a garden salad her food was perfect my disappointment is it a sandwich I'm not asking for a steak or pasta or seafood apparently their wings are to die for I've not had them in a while but I will tell you what the reviews when I was there were incredible so I guess next time I come I order their wings...... For anyone from the United States that's considering coming to Canada I ordered two glasses of wine a BLT with a salad on the side the salad actually comes with it my bill was $42 crazy !!!!! 9 ounce glass of wine so all I have to say to any of my friends from the US  stop at duty free before you come here ... you are aloud one bottle or one case of beer that's it xoxox although I'm moving my mom and dad wont back here I'm ready to count down to get back to the United States of America cuz it rocks"}
{"text":"So, my man and his friends have been going to this little place for awhile now. All I've heard is good things about the food, service and atmosphere. They would all go every Thursday for their Pint and a Pound Special for around $10. After hearing about how awesome this place is, I thought it was my turn to crash the boys' party and see what this place is all about.   It's in the middle of a plaza. I didn't really notice it until I got out of the car. It's got your typical sports pub d√©cor, a few TVs and wooden everything. It's a small place and it gets PACKED. I've been there twice now, one late night for Pint and a Pound Thursdays and one dinner for 59 cent Wings Tuesday. These specials are not on their website, so if the price/day is wrong, please let me know!   The wings are freakin huge and meaty. They have a good variety of sauces and seasonings that aim to please. The staff is small, but efficient. The service is great; friendly and laid back. Most importantly, the wings are ALWAYS good. I've never had anything else on the menu. I simply cannot pass up the wings.     Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"McGwyers has officially instilled a lifelong love of Ceasar's for me - the adult beverage, not the salad in case you are wondering!  Make sure to ask for their wing menu. I tried the honey garlic (nice and saucy) and the lemon pepper - I really a enjoy a flavourful dry rub wing. Only criticism here, where was the obligatory carrot and celery? And no blue cheese dip? No cool.  Since it was my first dinner of the day, I opted to have a Greek salad. Their home-made feta was quite sensational; the issue however was the sauce. It was so sour that my lips find themselves retreating to the back of my throat - yes, I understand that opens me up to a lot of pervy jokes but you get the idea!  Their wraps do come highly recommended !  But seriously, all you need is a nice beverage, a ceasar or two or three..."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever received here and will never be coming back. Family used to always always come here for the last 15 years but we won't be back anytime soon unfortunately.. has always been great with any of the owners around but unfortunately they can't seem to make things work without them there. Sat down at 6:45 on a Wednesday and the restaurant had almost 50% of the tables empty, and our first appetizer didn't get to our table until 7:50, didn't get our mains served until 830, just wasn't acceptable for a quite Wednesday night. Hopefully the owners can get some managers in to help keep up when they aren't around!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood pub by definition. Super casual atmosphere and the staff are generally pleasant and offer good service.  I have tried lots of menu items and the only thing I am disappointed with in the regular are the desserts. Also, I personally find the soups too salty but that might be a personal preference.  Overall I like the casual sports vibe and pub grub.   They have recently updated the menu so if you haven't stopped by in while, check it out.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food isn't too bad. Wing deals are what we come here for. But the service - on many occasions - is abysmal. They need to hire more friendly and sympathetic staff.  -  Me and my husband came in to eat, and were seated down at the table for 20 mins before being approached. The waitress \"Jessie\" finally came over and I let her know that we have been sitting here for over twenty mins without service - no water or anything. She retorted with a sarcastic attitude with me and went on from there.   We ordered some drinks and were asked for ID. I'm from the United States, so she asked to see more than just my drivers license. I got my passport from the car and she checked it over.   We ordered our food. It was a pint and pound special today as well as an oyster special. We figured out our order, trying to find the best \"deal\" combination, got our food and ate.   Our bill arrived and there was some confusion with charges and orders as we thought our waitress would try and accommodate us with the best deal. After inquiring about the charges, Jessie rudely commented stating \"well are you ever going to be back anyways?\" I was stunned. That statement implied that because I lived far away, I should just deal with it and pay the bill as she assumed I'll never be back. This shows I was not a valued customer at all. My husband lives 5 minutes away and we visit this place all the time. It was very disrespectful.  *UPDATE* After speaking to managers and the owner, we were given 50% off our food bill, and were offered a gift card the next time we visit."}
{"text":"When we arrived it took them 15 minutes to notice we were there, the waitress kept having a negative tone  \"-menu is a novel. -you will have a hard time deciding -most people don't like that\" Not very good at selling the location   I ordered the French onion soup and it tasted like someone dumped a container of rosemary in it, my husband had a turkey sandwich and said it was delicious.  I would probably come back if I wanted to watch a sporting event and eat wings."}
{"text":"I've been to Magwyers Pub a few times now. I've only gone on Tuesdays for their 59 cent wings night. To get the 59 cent wings deal, you have to order a drink and it's a minimum of 6 wings per flavour. The only downside to this awesome deal is that you can't take home your leftover wings.  The atmosphere is your typical pub style. Good service with friendly waitresses. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth trying!  From their wings flavours, I've tried honey garlic, zesty orange and lemon pepper. My favourite from the three is definitely honey garlic. The wings are huge, not like other wing places that I've been to. I've also tried their fries, onion rings and sweet potato fries. There's nothing outstanding about them but nice to have on the side of your wings."}
{"text":"Excellent establishment, excellent food, excellent staff. They deserve more than 5 Stars. Best wings in Ajax"}
{"text":"First time in Ajax, but Magwyer is a gem. Food is made from scratch and service and attention is great. Known for their wings, you can't overlook their soup and pie dishes.   I had the chicken pot pie and it wasn't over salted like many places and you could taste a hint of the white wine reduction. I had the dry rub wings, but I hear getting the wings sauced and grilled to carmelize the sugars is the way to go.  Good variety of beers on tap. If you're lucky, they'll have the Pint and Pound special for beer and wings.  Wish I was staying longer on business to try more of the food. I'm recommending the Magwyer to my Sales Manager who comes by every few months."}
