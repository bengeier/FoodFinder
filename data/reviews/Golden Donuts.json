{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches and fantastic fresh donuts..    The owner takes my donut and shoots it with custom filling for me.      Love this place I would recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Great doughnuts and sandwiches. Nice people too! Stopped in because I was shopping nearby and glad I did. Clean, good displays, clear menu, great service. Think it also has a drive through which is great for those weekend mornings when you want to go out in your pajamas. Will update if I try that some time."}
{"text":"Best donuts in town. The staff/owners are the sweetest people. Everyone is always kind to the kids, too. I can't say enough - the chocolate twist (all the twists...) are to die for. Brought my mom in get a donut because we were nearby and she ended up getting a dozen after eating hers  go... You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Our favorite donuts in the valley and the sweetest family runs the shop. If only donuts were better for you, we'd be going every day. :)"}
{"text":"As stated in a prior post Bosa's watch out.  I bought donuts here last weekend and they were fantastic!  Fresh and tasty and the service was great.  The gentleman that helped me was very nice.  I will definately be back!  If you have not been here and go to Bosa give it a try, you will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Golden Donuts definitely gets 5 stars from me! I have been here about 4 or 5 times now and everytime the customer service is excellent. They are always friendly and warm. They have a great donut variety and options for breakfast and lunch. This is by far my favorite donut shop in town!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing! Their donuts are really light and fluffy. They gave my daughter some free donut holes to munch on while we waited for my breakfast sandwich to be cooked. Definitely will be returning here."}
{"text":"Donuts are very stale. Smoothies are okay. Costumer service was iffy. Expected more. Place was kind of gross. Definitely go to bosa. A few miles away but worth it."}
{"text":"VERY RUDE counter worker. My daughter ordered a pineapple smoothie and very clearly said with boba. Now, she is a teenager, not a little child, speaks very clearly. It did not have boba in it. I took it back to the counter and said, this was supposed to have boba. She proceeds to tell me, no it wasn't, it wasn't ordered that way. I said, I very clearly heard my daughter say boba, but what ever. Then I noticed on the receipt I was charged .50 more, which is the price of the boba. So I went back and said excuse me, the smoothie was 3.49, you charged me 3.99, so you did charge for the boba. She said no, 3.99 is the price of a fruit smoothie, and I said, no, it clearly shows on your menu board 3.49. She then gets flustered and says that because it has fruit...they are all fruit smoothies, wth? Then she tells me I'll put it in for you, even though you didn't ask for it, it's not a big deal. Well, if it's not a big deal, and you are caught lying, how about you do the right thing? Maybe apologize? She obviously has no clue what good customer service is. Too bad too, the donuts are very good, but I would rather go out of my way and pay more money to have good customer service elsewhere. I'm not going to pay somebody to talk down to me and to be rude to me."}
{"text":"this place is great ! delicious breakfast bagels and unique donuts. very friendly service, great prices, and the thai iced tea is amazing ! check them out :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful family run donut place. The place looked clean and the owner? was super nice. I got a variety of donuts. The frosting tasted fresh, the cream was yummy and not too sweet like other places. Both the cake and regular are good, but I think the regular are better. Oh, and they still tasted good the next morning"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place. Way better than Bosa. Never had a bad donut from these guys."}
{"text":"First review I've ever written. Recently moved to the area. Just went in and grabbed a sandwich and a donut. Sandwich was really good and huge! Donut was good as expected! Will be here a few times a week from now on! Tons of menu options."}
{"text":"This place is so friendly and the customer service is so lovely , donuts are nice and soft even better than Dunkin' Donuts and the prices are so reasonable and cheap and who doesn't like that . The Thai tea is my favorite."}
{"text":"Bosa donuts watch out. :)   Great place.  Family owned mom and pop place.  The donuts are definitely better than dunkin.   The whole family liked it.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Far and away the best donuts in the East Valley!  Bosa is a very small step above Dunkin Donut's and DD has better coffee!    Golden Donuts has a very good selection of doughnuts, pastries and I especially love the cronuts!"}
{"text":"SADA is my favorite !!  She is so warm and welcoming !  I am coming back because of her : )"}
{"text":"Perfectly delicious! My kids requested Golden Donuts over Bosa which used to be their favorite. The donuts are freshly made daily and have a good selection. Customer service is friendly and shop is clean. Last several times we've been there they've thrown in complimentary donut holes or as I like to call them, little clouds of heaven! The Boston Cream has cream throughout the donut, not just the middle like some shops. Kids always get long johns and frosted with sprinkles and say they prefer this frosting to others. Luckily Golden Donuts is in our neighborhood which makes it easy to get our donut fix!"}
{"text":"Went there to buy donuts for clients.  I don't buy donuts often and I wanted coffee to go as well.  They had lots of varieties (so hard to choose!). They threw in not just 1 extra donut but 2!  And their full coffee service included sugar and Other sweeteners and a bag full of creamers--even if everyone  used 4 or 5 creamers we wouldn't have run out.  The donuts were delicious and the coffee was freshly made for me.  I would recommend this donut shop!"}
{"text":"I love Golden Donuts! I visit a few times a week to buy donuts for clients and I always have a great experience. The customer service, convenience, and tasty donuts will keep me coming back every week!"}
{"text":"Hands down best donuts !! And drive thru, but it is a slow drive thru .... I have tried coffee.. I prefer a dark bold roast .. All in all I will return"}
{"text":"It's pretty darn good and they always give extra donuts. The prices are low. The only thing is the owners kids are always running around and you can see them in the drive thru window. I doubted this place because it's literally next to a reptile store but surprisingly the donuts are amazing! The owners are also extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This place looks sketch from the outside, but I PROMISE it's soooooooo amazing. The staff was friendly as hell, the bagel and cream cheese was homemade, I could tell, AMAZING, and the tea and the shakes are unbelievable. GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just tried Golden donut for the first time Very cute and tidy, adorable little ladies manning the ship and REALLY yummy donuts!! Very fresh, light, airy and perfect sweetness.... I don't like mine so sweet u need insulin!!! Had to add them as a business, they weren't on yet. Corner of Pennington and baseline. Anyhow just a shout out to a new and yummy neighborhood business!"}
{"text":"We come here every Saturday morning love the doughnuts and breakfast sandwiches! Always get a dozen doughnut holes for 99 cents!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I love donuts. The family of this establishment is warm and friendly. I'm going to add generous to the list. Breakfast is the speciality, but don't be shy about stopping in for a sweet snack in the afternoon too."}
{"text":"Hands down, best doughnuts I've had in the valley.  I love maple long-johns and the first time I had one here it almost cost me my life.  I had decided kids were getting a quick and easy breakfast and headed out to get a dozen.  I made my selections and headed back to the house.  I couldn't help myself and grabbed my long-john, for some reason looked around to make sure nobody saw and bit into!  Bam!  My mouth started trembling, my mouth is convulsing, shaking and I realize my mouth had a giant taste bud orgasm.  As my tastebuds are climaxing I lose control and almost hit the car in front of me.  Luckily I regained my composure, straightened myself up, wiped the crumbs from and icing off my mouth and calmed my breathing.  I walked into the house and I couldn't hide my shame.  My wife locked eyes with mine and I knew, that she knew, that I had betrayed her and the kids because I had somehow ate 2 doughnuts!!!  I tried to come up with excuses, nothing I said made sense, \"It wasn't me!\" \"I was doughnut jacked by criminals!\" \"I was forced against my will at gunpoint!\" My wife didn't believe me one bit!  I finally admitted to her the truth.  I promised I'd change, I begged her to give me one more chance.  She said she forgave me.  But to this day she doesn't let me get doughnuts by myself anymore.    This is a small mom and pop shop.  Get there early on Sunday's because local churches buy them out quickly for their services.  When this happens we follow them, stake them out, wait for our moment and run in, grab a doughnut and hightail it out of there.  If this isn't possible, go to QT and get their doughnuts as they are a close second."}
{"text":"Popped in on a Saturday afternoon for a half dozen donuts. It was incredibly hard to choose just six (but the owner, who is such a kind lady, gave me an extra donut for free). I ended up with 3 different types of cake donuts and 4 yeast donuts, all for only $5.60. Hands down the best donuts I have ever had. The Boston Cream donut was out of this world! They have a variation of it with coconut topping instead of chocolate frosting, which was my absolute favorite out of the seven. Even my dad, who is not a donut fan whatsoever, was completely blown away!  Will definitely be back to try more variations, including an apple fritter. But that coconut cream donut will always be on my list! Definitely recommend. Great service and superb donuts."}
{"text":"We have breakfast here frequently. Their breakfast sandwiches are delicious and their fresh homemade donuts are amazing! Not to mention the sweetest staff! So happy to have a great breakfast spot so close by that's affordable."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. My fiance and I went here to grab a quick breakfast. I walked in and saw some of the donuts looked somewhat like BOSA donuts so I thougt it would be tasty. I was so wrong. We ordered two breakfast sandwiches the sausage one tasted like the eggs were cooked in old grease, and the croissant sandwich I did not even eat and gave it to my dog, and she did not even eat it!!. The croissant sandwich had one slice of thin ham, and a tiny piece of cheese. The donut holes we ordered tasted more than two days old. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"So I was craving something sweet and had to find a place near work.  I turned to my trusty YELP app and found this lil spot.    They sell donuts here as well as coffee and tea drinks including boba, breakfast sandwiches and soft drinks.    I went in for a donut or donut holes...some form of sugary sweetness. haha  First of all, they do NOT have a drive thru, not a huge issue, but something to note if you are expecting a snack on the fly.  The location itself had some seating and was clean inside. It was very no frills and I am pretty certain most customers head in and takeout.   There was a lot of space in the case, but not too many donuts.  The owner noticed and was nice enough to let me know that they fry them up in smaller bactches during the day to avoid waste.  She just bought the business and is still trying to figure out volume.    I had an old fashioned crumb and it was very fresh and tasty! It was a lil sweet, but it is a donut after all so I can't complain.  I'll probably get a plain old fashioned next time or try one of the raised donuts rather than a cake.   I would come here WAY over going to chain donut place as they usually use parbaked donuts or only have good tasting donuts when they are just fried. Check them out for a sweet snack. =)"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts.  Great smoothies and surprisingly good breakfast samdwiches.  Staff is always smiling and friendly"}
{"text":"Best donut I have ever had! Nice friendly lady assisted us, donut looks great and after one bite I knew it was the best donut I had ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I was actually looking for bosa and came across this place. There doughnuts are seriously amazing and fresh! They were still warm when I got them."}
{"text":"For Father's Day SUNDAY morning they only had two women working. That's not enough....we waited for 15 mins to get service. And when we finally ordered the woman helping us got it so wrong. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is probably the best donut shop i ever been too. Their donuts are always delicious and taste fresh. And the ladies that work there are always so friendly. You will not be disappointed if you stop by!"}
{"text":"This place won't be open very long if they're not staffed! I just walked in stood there for 10 min & no one was there to help me so I left!"}
{"text":"Golden Donut is our kids favourite place after their musical class Saturday morning. They love the donut holes and seem not to have enough every single time. Coffee is good here too. I personally love the fresh and soft boba, YESSS you heard it right, they make the boba in house!! Another plus is the customer service. Owner always is happy and greets us with big smile. They gave my kids free donut holes sometimes too. 5 stars place for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a great Mom & Pop donut shop. They have great donuts and are SUPER nice people. The drive thru window is very convenient as well. The owner is so nice that she even brings the donuts out to my vehicle for me due to a disability That I have. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts in town.  Even late at night, they are always fresh and are of high quality.  I think I'll start to try their sandwiches for lunch as well."}
{"text":"Excellent donuts.  Small shop, family owned.  Good prices and friendly faces."}
{"text":"The boxes were WARM, the glaze was just setting.  Soft, fluffy, chewy.  Great service with smiles.  Quick.  Reasonable prices.  Hole in the wall.  Pretty much the perfect donut shop."}
{"text":"Nice little donut shop.  Not a fancy or new-looking joint, but it was clean.  The donuts are well-priced, fresh, and there was a great selection available when I was there around 5pm on a Wednesday.  The guy behind the counter was friendly.  I ordered a half dozen donuts, some donut holes, and a thai tea with boba.  Everything was good.  I'm not usually in this part of the Valley but would return if passing through."}
{"text":"A coworker brought in a variety of donuts from Golden Donuts and they were all delicious! Seriously just the glazed one was simple and delicious! Would definitely go back to this place for yummy donuts!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I come here frequently! The breakfast and lunch sandwiches are always fresh and delicious! Service is on point and the variety of donuts is fantastic! They recently updated their menu with some new donuts and smoothies! YUMMY:-))"}
{"text":"Love this local donut place! We were so happy to see that they were open on Christmas Morning! Donuts are amazing and very reasonable. Employees are super friendly and even gave us a little bag of donut holes while we were waiting. We tried the egg and bacon breakfast sandwich snd it was really good as well. Can't wait to go back! Much better than Dunkin' or Krispy Kreme!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a breakfast sandwich and iced coffee on my way to alt work assignment site in Mesa and was well pleased.  My ham & egg & cheese on what tasted like fresh croissant was really good, and my iced coffee refreshing,  not overly sweet, and got my day off to a good start.    Thankfully I was not in a hurry as the lady running the shop had apparently been left on her own  when a co-worker didn't show up on time for busy on-the-way-to-work morning hours. There were a number of us having to wait longer than would have been preferable, but with the lady literally running from kitchen to counter taking orders, preparing food, ringing up the charge, and being apologetic about the delays, I just can't fault them or her for that - at least this time, and look forward to going back and actually sampling a doughnut!    P.S.  I noted whole of establishment visible to the customer was spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"So I thought I had found heaven when I saw a place that served donuts and ice cream. I could finally bring my lactose intolerant friends somewhere they could also choose a sweet treat. Unfortunately I just found another donut shop. Don't be fooled by the title. They Do Not Have Ice Cream!:("}
{"text":"Visited again today. The doughnuts were as great as my previous visit. I would usually only order raised, this time I ordered cake, old-fashioned, and buttermilk. This updated review surrounds their milk tea. On the menu they offer a variety of milk tea such as, taro, honeydew, strawberry, etc. I ordered strawberry milk tea. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped, but I won't hold that against them. The lady behind the counter simply put strawberry flavoring powder on black milk tea and blended it. I'm not a fan of powders and syrups because they make a drink taste overly sweet and synthetic. To sum it up, I recommend their black milk tea but not their strawberry milk tea. I might try their taro milk tea to see if that's made from powder also (I didn't see taro powder from their supply)."}
{"text":"This is a family owned shop. They have a lot of things other than donuts and coffee. I'm not a big fan of donuts but I tried a maple bar and raspberry filled and they were delicious. I also tried a bacon breakfast burrito which was so good I came back the next morning to get another one. This place does have a drive thru if you were wondering. The staff is super friendly. This have a punch card for drinks, but 9 and get one free. So if you drink coffee or a boba, make sure to get a card! Another thing, they super inexpensive for what you receive. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great service and great donuts! Welcomed with a smile the moment I walked in! The lady who helped us was fast and had a good attitude. Unfortunately I only got a chance to try the donuts and not the other food they offered, but they are cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":".99 dozen fresh donut holes     .................    Yelp is making me write more to post this but the donuts here are great and there is a cool reptile store and aquarium store adjacent check them out as well."}
{"text":"A nice little donut shop in my hood. They serve more than just donuts. They have breakfast sandwiches and smoothies as well.  I've only tried the donuts. They are light and fluffy, served room temperature.  The only thing that would make them better is if they were warm."}
{"text":"To die for! Super fresh and super delicious donuts. My favorite was the chocolate cake donut. It tastes like a piece of chocolate cake, it was very light, chocolatey and delicious. It was worth me seeking them out. My expectations were set high sense navigation through me off and took me through a residential neighborhood to get to this heavenly location. I am going to spread the good word about this place and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We're temporarily staying in Mesa & we came across this Donut shop. Every donut we've tried during each visit(4 so far & still counting) is Delicious! We also came across the Blended Horchata drink & we're hooked on those too! After ordering we chatted with another customer who asked us about the horchata drink we'd just ordered & she mentioned their Boba drink(They have all sorts of different ones) is really good too."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the whole array of doughnuts, since I had a quick visit more for a look around near the end of the day and only bought doughnut holes ($1.59/doz.). But as far as holes go, they were top-notch and those I shared them with thought they were great and tasted fresh even though it was nearly 8 pm.  Overall, Golden Donuts looks promising. Regular & specialty doughnuts are $0.89 and $1.29 respectively. An assorted dozen is $9. I didn't notice anything particularly unique about the selection though, so I'll have to go back and look harder (they'll need something to differentiate themselves from cheaper doughnuts at Albertson's across the street).  There seemed to be plenty of seating, but I had zero desire to spend time there since the place feels a little too sanitized and clinical right now. I know it's new, but they really need to dress the place up.  So a good start overall. I'll be back to try some different varieties and make a better assessment."}
{"text":"After a previous fiasco at the old location where someone (Working for them? Or maybe related to them? Or a concerned Donut Nazi?) sent me a private message accusing me of working for Yelp after saying their Thai iced tea was too sweet, I was hesitant to try the new location. I figured though, we'll let bygones be bygones. A new location has the promise of a new donut experience!   The menu is quite extensive as they have a wide selection of donuts, sandwiches, breakfast burritos, coffee, and smoothies. I decided on a chicken breakfast burrito and a few donuts to go. The burrito was made right on the spot and took only a few minutes to make. It was a decent sized burrito, with grilled tortilla, scrambled egg, cheese, hash browns, and grilled chicken breast. I appreciated that the chicken option exists since usually you only have ham, sausage, or bacon as your breakfast burrito options. There was a balanced amount of ingredients and it wasn't super salty which I really liked. The hash browns were slightly mushy but overall I enjoyed the burrito.   The donuts were excellent. I tried a cake donut with maple frosting. The cake was a perfect texture, not too dense, slightly pillowy light. It was a good amount of sweetness and the maple glaze was just the right amount. There was a slight crispness around the edges to contrast with the softness of the interior. A cinnamon sugar twist I had was very fresh and soft.  Service was good and I didn't need to repeat my order several times to the cashier unlike my previous visit at the old location :)  If I'm in the area it's not a bad place for a tasty donut!"}
{"text":"I went to grab a couple dozen donuts to try and bring smiles to a memorial for a friend. I knew everyone would be grieving and needed some comfort. These donuts are so beautiful and colorful, with so many combinations of flavors - and they did the trick! They brought about a lot of smiles, and were totally delicious too. So glad to find this gem for a tough day, and I'll definitely be back for happier days as well."}
{"text":"Friendly people and their boba's and coffee are great! Always come here every morning to get my coffee fixed!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They are a friendly family owned business. Their donuts are great too! I like to go there and get a toasted bagel with cream cheese, but I've also had their donuts their apple fritters and donuts. Everything you try here will be really good. Srsly"}
{"text":"The donuts are always fresh and have so many choices to choose from. Smoothies, ice cream, sandwiches, and all sorts of donuts plus drinks! The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great donuts!!! Very soft and delicious even towards the end of the day when other places go stale.  Coming back whenever I'm in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!! What can I say, best tasting donuts i've ever had!  I am picky cause I used to be a baker.  Will come back for sure.  Service is awesome.  Place is very clean."}
{"text":"Was hungry for some apple fritters nearby and yelped this place...my goodness they have the next best apple fritters I've ever had! Crunchy outside, excellent glaze, loaded with apple chunks, the perfect size (slightly larger diameter as a regular glazed donut instead of oversized-big-as-dining-plates which I usually cut in half) and only .99¢!!! They also make a blueberry one that's berry-berry tasty!!! My wife tried their maple bar and I took a bite; she said Bosa tastes better to her but I thought it was good...1 star knocked off for a weird location next to a reptile store lol but just go there for the donuts and you will be happy...unless you're like my wife and think the competition makes it better lol"}
{"text":"Came here because my friend was raving about this place. My family and I loved the volume and texture of the donuts. It wasn't too light or too filling. Tried the boba on a whim and was pleasantly surprised! The taro slush tasted great, and the boba is the freshest I've ever had in AZ. Definitely making the trip to come here more often."}
{"text":"As others have said, best donuts ever! A thousand times better than the major chains and a million times better than grocery store donuts. I stopped in on our way to a play date, as this shop is near our friends' house. Super friendly lady called out from the back that she would be right with us. The display cases held a variety of temptations and the smell wafting throughout the shop was intoxicating.  I made our selections while my 3 year old son jumped up and down in excited anticipation. In addition to the kid-appeal cake donuts (chocolate and vanilla) covered in a variety of sprinkles and frostings, I also selected Boston cream, raspberry-filled, sugar raised and toasted coconut. The lady rang up our purchase, thanked me with a warm smile and gave me a frequent-guest punch card.  We arrived at our friends' house with the box of deliciousness, and let the kids select their choices first. My fellow mom friend picked a toasted coconut and I took a Boston cream. We each immediately fell in love with our choices. The Boston cream was beyond fresh, with a nicely intense, silky smooth chocolate frosting and a luxurious custard filling. I also got to sample the last bite of my son's chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting and rainbow sprinkles. It was delicious, just fresh, not at all greasy and ever so slightly crispy along the edges.  I brought home a toasted coconut to my husband and he was equally smitten, saying how good it was even after sitting all day. If I lived as close to Golden as my friend does, I would probably gain 100 lbs and become a diabetic within 6 months. Dangerous, definitely dangerous, but a taste sensation if you can practice even a modicum of self control and not wolf down an entire dozen in one sitting!"}
{"text":"The donuts and croissants are so light and delicate in the mouth. Make a stop for breakfast. They offer an array of options. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I love this shop! Fresh donuts made daily and very clean.  The people are very friendly. Not too far from work. You want fresh donuts try out Golden Donuts. You will get many choices of boba drinks and donuts."}
{"text":"Doughnuts:  An excuse to eat cake for breakfast.  If you've tried Golden Donuts' cake doughnuts, it really is like eating cake for breakfast --- which I'm more than okay with!    Smaller than their regular yeast-raised doughnuts, the cake doughnuts are ridiculously moist, dense, fluffy, and has a good amount of sweetness.  Not to be outshine, their raised doughnuts are just as good, even lighter in texture, and are gigantic.  It's hard to say which is better but they're both amazing.  They sell a dozen doughnut holes for $0.99 to cater to the students around the area which I find spectacular.  It's a small mom and pop place and from what I hear, they recently changed owners.  It's a clean shop that also sells beverages like smoothies and boba.  Stop in and give Golden Donuts a try!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are sooooo good. I have a new found love for croissants! The donuts are amazing as well. This place is across from my work. I could get breakfast here everyday!"}
{"text":"Best variety of donuts available. Their service is amazing and their product is delicious, with just a little bit more to offer than the average donut this is my number one morning spot. the hours seem to be A bit variable, when they're open I'm happy they are."}
{"text":"This review will be brief because my visit was brief.  I walked into Golden Donuts and no one was present.  After a couple minutes, a man appeared from the back.  He did not smile.  He did not ask me how he could help me.  Eventually I asked if the fritter I was seeking was apple or blueberry.  He told me it was apple.  He bagged it for me.  Then I asked if they had soft drinks.  He just pointed toward a case that was behind me.  I got what I wanted and brought it to the register.   I paid, said thank you and left.    The service was just... well... adequate.  This is in stark comparison to the service I have received at Bosa, Boba and Donuts and just about every other donut shop.    The fritter, however, was PHENOMENAL.  I only intended to eat a little bite of it before my appointment.  Once I took a bite, I had to finish it.  It had a lot of cinnamon, crisp, yummy apple and it was not overly greasy.  It was sooooo good  that I wanted to go back in and buy a dozen more.  Of course, the guy was back in the back room so I decided to wait for another day!  In the words of the Terminator \"I'll be back!\""}
