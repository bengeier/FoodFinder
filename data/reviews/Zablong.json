{"text":"Perfect; never tried a pizza like this before. Recommend layering on the toppings. Recommend Vampire Slayer."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Crust makes the difference and this place has the best! Wonderful staff and vibe."}
{"text":"Dropped in during a drink at the French Quarter and ate this pizza with friends in the courtyard. Stumbled into this place late night with little prompting (they are open until 3am) and picked up a pizza and was pleasantly surprised!   Any place that lets you add any many toppings as you want and has a variety of sauces you know it's going to be good. And all for about $10 each pizza. I got the gluten-free crust and you couldn't tell it was gluten-free at all and the people I fed it too never suspected! Gluten-free crust can be hit or miss, so was very glad it was a HIT!  THE STAFF- actual smiling faces! I know it must be tough to work in the food service industry, especially late on a Friday night, but every person I interacted with pleasant. From the guy who sauced my crust (ha ha ha), to the guy who took it out of the oven, and girl at the cash register- all smiled at me and didn't even ask for a tip.   I would give this place 4.5 stars because that half a star demotion is because of the name of restaurant. When we saw the sign above the door, it looked like 'blonq'. So we stood there at 11pm after a few drinks trying to sound out the name! Is it b-long because the pizza is long in shape? It is 'blond' because you can get a white pizza? I don't know, what do you think?? It wasn't until I got my receipt I saw the real name of this place- Zablong. The 'Za' letters in the sign are unreadable. NOTE TO OWNER: Get a new sign, so late night drinkers like me can find you and continue to eat here!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza joint I've been to in a decade. It's fresh, friendly and fantastic. You have your choice of making it any way you want or choosing from a variety of specialities. Regardless  you're in for a treat. Not only is the food amazing, the service is exceptional. Always quick, friendly and professional and they will remember you when you go.  Be a regular, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I go to the French Qtr every couple of weeks for my eyebrows and decided to drop in to get something for dinner. Thank goodness I did. As others have mentioned, it's create your own pizza with fresh ingredients. You customize as much as you want, which I did including that awesome garlic and red sauce. To date this is probably one of my favorite pizza places I have tried in Charlotte. The best part is that the pizza heats up beautifully in the oven for leftovers, just as good as the day you got it. I knock it down just a tad because some of the preparers are a little more heavy handed than others with the sauces. (I enjoy garlic but it was tad much) . Definitely a great place to grab a bite for an excellent price!"}
{"text":"Got to finally stop by for lunch today. Loved it. Created  my own and shared a dessert pizza - a warm apple with cinnamon crunch. It was awesome. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Such good pizza! And very friendly service:) will be back! In an adorable alley and very cute for date night to split a pizza."}
{"text":"Zablong is amazing! Discovered this place while hanging out at the hookah bar in the same alley way and have not regretted it since!  A friend lives nearby so it always comes in handy on nights out and we decide to walk back to the apartment and want some food.  You can choose off the menu or go down the line and choose your own ingredients! For $10 it's worth it and is great for one person with leftover for the morning or to split.  We usually get a pizza each and customize our own and share among the 4-5 of us.  That way we get to try some of the many possibilities there are!  If you're into spice I definitely recommend their Angry tomato sauce!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with a few coworkers. First off, every ingredient is high quality--- it's a noticeable step up from Uncle Maddio's. I think they've only been open a week, but the line moved very slowly. Hopefully this will improve, as Chipotle-like efficiency is a key to their business model. I ordered the vampire slayer---garlic and ricotta base with salami. Maybe it was just the ingredients on this particular pizza, but it was extremely oily and the crust a bit soggy. The flavor was great and the price was in line with the quality ($9.29). If they can speed up the line and get the crust crispier, I think they have a winner."}
{"text":"Peculiar Pizza is a welcome addition to the overall transformation of the French Quarter.  If there's a line, it will go by quickly as long as the people in front of you researched the menu and know what they want.  There are menus available while you are waiting, so be prepared.  They offer three different crusts and an amazing assortment of sauces.  The ghost pepper pepperoni is the way to go if you like some additional heat and spice. There is also a cold topping station where you pay (parm cheese, red peppers, olive oil, etc).  No one should ever leave there hungry.  There are shared tables (beer garden style) inside and tables outside.  The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place existed until meeting up with friends one evening. Hands down the best pizza I've had here in Charlotte. The build your own pizza is awesome and the staff is very warm and friendly. I recommend this place to pizza lovers, definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Saw they opened today.  OMG, the best pizza I've ever had!  I had \"The Misfit\" and the meatballs were exceptional.  The strawberry balsamic really brought out all the other flavors.  Can't wait til I'm hungry again so I can try a another one of the signatures!"}
{"text":"Za Blong is a great place to grab a delicious pizza and also have a great time! I had the pleasure of attending the grand opening last night and could not be more pleased! It is a different take on your average pizza and that is so refreshing! Meathead is awesome and the Berry dessert Pie is to die for great!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Pizza joint is located right in the city. Something very different than your usual pizza joints, to me this place is a hidden gem. I stared seeing people with these rectangular pizza boxes and wondered where they got them from. Once I stumbled in with my brother we were not disappointed. Great service, great pizza, all at a great price. The unlimited topping selection was also a great. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Always fast, even at the lunch rush. The flat-rate for the build-your-own pizza is very nice, and the pizza is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Zablong rocks!  So this place is super popular in uptown right now.  If you're in uptown during lunch time, odds are you'll see people walking around with those zebra striped weird rectangular pizza boxes.  Those are all Zablong.    My coworkers and i have taken to going 2 or 3 times a week to this place.  Its really great because you get to build your own pizza from the dough up. It's one price so be sure to load up on toppings.  Here's my go-to order: regular dough, angry tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, ghost pepper salami, meatball, jalepeno, green peppers, mushrooms, and top it off with parmesan and sundried tomatoes.  Thank me later!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Great food. We went Saturday night of Black Friday weekend. The area was crowded, but we got through the line quickly and found a place to sit outside. They had an outdoor heater, but we were warm enough in our jackets without it.  You get to choose all of your toppings, almost like a Subway. Except much tastier. They also have a menu of pizzas, including dessert pizza. We got the tree hugger, and we got a cheese pizza with no sauce for the kids. Everyone loved their food. You get your own fountain drink from one those computerized drink machines with the touch screen, where you can tell it to pour any combination of drink and flavoring. The kids love those things."}
{"text":"We were run from the rain and found a great make a rectangular style pizza. You had my husband when he saw prosciutto. The kids got eat out of and color the pizza box.  Whats more to love!"}
{"text":"Flew into Charlotte and my family was starving. Luckily found this place and everyone enjoyed their pizza. Bonus staff was really nice!  We shared the treehugger, Woodstock, and a regular pizza. All delicious!"}
{"text":"I usually like this place but I won't be going again after midnight that's for sure. The employees have zero control of the place and some of the customers are sketch. I didn't know pepperoni was called F---ing pepperoni at this place and thankfully I hadn't taken a guest in there because the F word was thrown around more than the pizza dough. It felt dirty and the employees gave my pizza away and then lied about it. I left because I lost my appetite.  Yuck. Yuck. Yuck."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Think, Subway or Chipotle's ordering concept, but with pizza. You pay a standard price and can get as many toppings as you want. Speaking of, their topping choices are numerous and unique offering endless pizza building options. If you aren't in the mood to build your own pizza you can order one of their signature pies. It's a great place for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike. The service is very quick and the staff is very courteous and personable. I'm always greeted with a smile and \"thank you\".   In Summary: + Great Food (variety, healthy, quality, unique) + Good Service + Fun Location (despite being in congested uptown) + Good Price"}
{"text":"This is a great find.  Charlotte has a lot of pizza restaurants and this is one of the best.  It's a fast casual atmosphere, sort of like a pizza version of Chipotle.  I love the customization.  You can pick from some of the pre-set menu options or customize.  It's the same price for anything you pick.  You order at the counter and they pop the pizza in the oven.    I love thin crust and this is perfect.  I had the whole wheat crust \"Tree Hugger\"...olive oil, cheese base topped with arugula, cherry tomatoes and black olives.  Delicious!  Eclectic atmosphere.  I enjoyed the hip hop soundtrack."}
{"text":"Eating here for the first time with three friends. Great fresh pizza. You get to pick you own toppings and the $9.29 cost includes as many toppings as you want. The staff and management are super nice and passionate about the new pizza concept. Import beers coming soon and staying open late on the weekends will start in March. The name Zablong Peculiar Pizza is due to the oblong dough and ZA is slang for pizza. Come make your own pizza and enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Great variety of toppings, sauces and even dough. I liked the atmosphere. There is a lot of construction in the area so parking is difficult but the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't reviewed Zablong yet!  Zablong is tucked away within the outside portion of the Latta Arcade. They have some seating indoors and some outdoors. The pizzas are large rectangular pizzas and easily enough for two to share. Typically, my husband and I will do half and half and just share the entire thing!  We recently came to Zablong on Friday to grab a pizza before a show. There are so many topping options at this place that I usually get overwhelmed and make my husband order the entire thing. On this occasion, he ordered half tripping goat and half meat lovers. I absolutely love the shroom truffle oil on the Tripping Goat. I believe he also added pork belly to the meat lovers. That is the beauty of this place, unlimited toppings. They have some odd toppings too like pork belly, shrimp, different oils, etc. All pizzas are $10.  Pro tip - They are open till 3am on the weekends if you are craving some late night munchies!"}
{"text":"Ok this pizza is the bomb. I made my own pizza and it was delicious. Get the mushroom truffle and tomato sauce mix. Think &Pizza (in DC) x 1000"}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza.  I found out the first time I went that I could split the pizza in two and try different flavors.  So I tried the Greek philosopher (minus the onions) and the southern comfort.  Both were delicious.  I'm actually glad I split the pizza as I think a whole pizza of either flavor would have been too much for me.  I would definitely recommend and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First time me and my wife have eaten here. Staff is very nice and the pizza is amazing. You can build your pizza however you want if you decide too. They have everything you can imagine to put on your pizza. Will be coming back here again. Also open till 3am if their busy enough to stay open. I would recommend this to anyone who loves pizza :)"}
{"text":"Zablong is located in the French Quarter by the park.  It seems to be frequented by both business travelers like myself (saw someone walking into my hotel with one!) and locals alike.  Service here was impeccable - the employee was helpful with explaining to me how everything worked and what all the options were.  He even helped suggest some pizzas I might like.  I eventually built my own, but he was kind, friendly, and patient.  5 star service for sure!  These pizzas are massive.  At $10.06 after tax - it's really a steal.  It's also too much pizza for a single person, so I'd suggest sharing or planning to save half for the next day.  I like that they have whole wheat and gluten free dough options here.  There's also a ton of sauce options, along with meat, cooked vegetables/cheese, and toppings such as basil and other kinds of cheese you can add on your pizza afterwards.  You can't really go wrong here - especially when you can build your own.  May I suggest ghost pepper salami, angry sauce, artichokes, and the GARLIC PUREE!!!  Don't forget the garlic puree, you garlic lovers like myself!  My only thing was the pizza became a little soggy after only a very short walk home.  They also don't really have that many options as far as spice goes - no red pepper flakes (at least when I was there) and only hot pepper oil.  You can add fresh jalapenos, but that's a little scary.  Otherwise great deal, great service, and great food!"}
{"text":"Greatest pizza in Charlotte! Just moved down here a month ago from upstate NY. Stumbled upon this place and it reminded me of a subway for pizza. Very cool design concept, super clean and the staff is patient and understanding. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza BUT the service is slow. I went on a Friday afternoon and the line was so long. I was surprised that it took so long but I soon discovered they were way understaffed. I was in line for thirty minutes which is ridiculous for a lunch rush. However, the pizza is always good and fresh. The workers are nice too. I'll try to go back on a less busy day!"}
{"text":"I happen to be downtown to pick up clothing from my fav alterations shop and was informed the best place to get a good lunch was Zablong!  So...stopped in...and was amazed at the cool ambience!  Really cool place!  So went up to the ordering bar and was pleased with the great sauces that were offered.  One of my favorites....Pesto! So..being here for first time...had to creative to get the feel for the process.  Selected both doughs for the pie...wheat and white.  And began the easy task of selecting various toppings to top the sauces.  The server was great with explanations and descriptions of the veggies and meat toppings.  I have  had some great pies...but this turned out to be too good!!!  I have a \"Lunch Buddies\" group at work and could not wait to share the pics!  I will be back here again...and again...and will order pies for the Super game coming up soon too!!!"}
{"text":"best pizza i had ever. Extraordinary toppings like falafel and their sauces are awesome. You are going to build your own pizza."}
{"text":"Love Zablongs!! I've been looking for a pizza place similar to my favorite in DC (&pizza) and this is def the closest! The staff are always warm and welcoming. I just hate it took me so long to find them. I wish it could remain hidden but that's just me being selfish. The ingredients are FRESH and the different choice of sauces are great! I hate that they close early now on the weekend, it was my favorite after the bar  spot. It doesn't stop me from going, but the drunks ruined it for all of us. But I can understand  (kind of).   It's definitely a must try!! You can't beat the price for what you get!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this pizza spot for a while and had the chance to try it last week for lunch.  We decided to go a little early before the main lunch crowd started to come, which was a good decision because the line can get started very quickly.  It was a good idea that I looked at Yelp beforehand to get an idea of what I wanted.  I tried to look at their menu online, but could never get the menu to come up.  I think it would be beneficial if they fixed that as you can get very overwhelmed when going to a place like this and have to be quick on your decisions with so many topping choices.  It would also be nice because we were going to order  1/2 the southern comfort, and the toppings have completely changed than what is on menu pictures on yelp.  We decided to order  1/2 Meathead and  1/2 Southern Comfort (now is which chicken and onion instead of bacon and corn).  We added additional toppings to both sides.  I love that we could do a half and half and get as many toppings as we wanted.  Now for the taste.  Meathead gets a 5 - this was hands down a wonderful side!  Loved every bit of it, the sauce, the meats, and just the over all taste.  The Southern Comfort gets a 2 maybe a 3.  I did not like the sauce and just taste of it.  The toppings were fine, but the sauce ruined it for me.  So if I had only had that pizza, I would have not been impressed.  As I have learned with MOD pizza which has the same concept, you really have to know what to order and get the right thing.  I have to give the edge to MOD with these pizzas that are made quickly on the spot with as many toppings as possible.  I like the taste better with MOD and they do have a choice in sizing, can get personal or larger sized pizzas.  It would be nice to get a personal size here because the last thing I want to do is be carrying a box back to the office.  Luckily, I was with someone to split and we took care of that issue by eating it!   I struggle on giving this a 3 or 4, wish I could give it a 3.5, but I feel like I have to down grade it to a 3 since I didn't like one side of the pizza, they need to fix their website, and would like options for a personal size pizza.  Fix that and it would be a 4."}
{"text":"Situated in Latta Arcade, this new restaurant is hip! The restaurant functions almost Chipotle style -- start off with a base and add the toppings from there. They have suggestion /signature pizzas that you can add toppings to for no additional price. Be careful though, because you can definitely overload with the veggies and get an interesting mix!   The pizza goes through a conveyor belt and is prepared within minutes. Talk about efficiency! What's also great is that they have vegan cheese / protein, so really everybody wins.   The manager was so sweet, and everyone working there is so nice!   Definitely recommend coming here! It is WORTH the visit. (Custom pizza cost: ~$10.75)"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other review; the crust could be crispier and the line could be faster or have another oven to speed up the process.  Otherwise the ingredients are fresh and tasty and I did like it better than Maddios.  I also had the pomegranate berry tea, which pretty much tasted like water."}
{"text":"Personalized thin crust Sicilian pizza for $11 and change, you can't lose.  I call it \"The all day pizza\", its more than enough to buy for lunch, eat 4 squares, and then eat the remaining 4 squares throughout the course of your workday. They have different sauces other than your simple tomato and plenty of toppings to make every order unique and filling.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating. If you choose to consume the whole thing in one sitting, I wish you the best of luck."}
{"text":"This pizza is great! The menu features a variety of unique pizzas that have great interesting flavors! You can also create your own with anything they have. All pizzas are the same rate (approx $10). Its a 8 slice pizza. I did half Tripping Goat and the Misfit, both AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place!  And the pizza tastes great with lots of fresh ingredients to choose from.  Must try!"}
{"text":"Only reason I gave 1 Star is because I couldn't give 0. Pizza is decent but after having issues offering from them and trying to talk to management to resolve issues I will never go back. I was hung up on by the shift manager. After contacting them via Facebook I was told that they would address my issue and contact me within 1-2 days. It took 9 days. They contacted me back but wanted me to call them. Was given a number by Brandon to call. Tried, no answer, full voicemail box. Called the store. After talking with Brandon, who did not identify himself as a manager but as a consultant hired to run things, everything got worse. His staff lied to him about our interaction and in hindsight I realized that he wholeheartedly believed them. He had no answers and would not let me speak.he dismissed my right as a customer to be upset. I have never had a more unprofessional interaction"}
{"text":"Went in with some friends based on review.   Crust was not that good.  The pizza sauce with the toppings and it being cooked in a conveyer oven just did not have good texture and flavor.   I think there are much better pizza options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love this spot for lunch, but I recommend splitting a pizza. It's amazing value and really tasty. I got the farm hand, but making your own looks like a good way to go. Think a Chipotle-style pizza place"}
{"text":"While having drinks at the Cotton Room, several people came back with Zablong boxes. So peer pressure caused me to stop by!   This is my 5th/6th visit...I've just never written a review. When I explain to people what it is, I refer to it as designer pizza! I've never ordered from the preset menu (the vampire slayer is on my radar), I always build my own. The crust can be white, wheat or gluten free. There's a variety of sauces to choose from as your base...then it's toppings time!! The basics are available: pepperoni, olives, mushrooms, etc. But then there are non traditionals like charred broccolini, carmelized onions, falafel, ghost pepper salami (which wasn't scary at all), etc. Once the oblong shaped pie exits the oven, there are finishers. Arugula, parmesan cheese, bbq sauce, basil oil, etc. If you are indecisive, visit when the traffic is low, this way you can decide without holding up the line of hungry pizza enthusiasts!!   This is a great place and the staff is always entertaining and friendly!!"}
{"text":"When you are a out-of-towner traveling around the first thing aside from experiencing the sites of a new city or the eats that you can seek find and destroy! Zablong attracted that I with its flatbread esque style pizza. With fresh ingredients in the ability to create your own pizza this street was nothing short of spectacular! I very much enjoyed my pizza and that I would definitely bookmark this for future visits whenever I am in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"lot of custom options , subway style selection choices.  Ingredients tastes fresh and good."}
{"text":"Great little pizza shop in Charlotte! You can top your pizza with any toppings and the price stays the same, which is awesome! The man that was working there was from Detroit and was super friendly and offered some great suggestions for toppings. The corner pieces were our favorite but the whole thing was fantastic! We ordered a plain cheese for our 5 year old, which he loved. And then my husband and I ordered a pizza with angry tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ham, salami, green pepper, red onion, roasted red peppers and jalapeño....delicious and SUPER filling. When you get a pizza with that many toppings, it's definitely shareable. Overall, great experience and we will visit again."}
{"text":"I will definitely be going back! This was some deliciously made pizza! Great combinations and yummy crust!"}
{"text":"I've stumbled - wait, I meant walked over to Latta Arcade a few times to take advantage of this amazing little make your own pizzeria after a knights game or two. In my opinion, Zablong is currently the best of the new personal pizza trends through huge portions, lots of crazy toppings, and friendly staff.  I will admit the menu is a little overwhelming. They have several 'starter' pizzas, but I tend to spend too much time analyzing the toppings and sauce combinations so I often kick it to the staff to give me a start. I've never met a person in a bad mood there and they mention to me they help get customers started all the time. Also pro tip, the pizzas are long, not circular, so you can get 2 pizzas/sauces/types of toppings if you want. Honestly the portions are so large (and for $10, not a bad deal) that I often split with someone or save half for later. Regarding the toppings, they have some crazy choices like pork belly and will literally put any amount or combination on your pizza. So go ham - wait, I meant crazy. My only complaint is seating is pretty limited, but with Romare Bearden park right across the street I would prefer to take it to go anyways."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Zablong it's always delicious and a welcoming atmosphere. There's this one guy who works there who can only be described as a Pizza Hypeman and he makes me smile every time I walk in. I don't know his name but I assume upon reading this, people will know EXACTLY who I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to the place after having a good first experience but I am so disappointed with the quality of the food that i can say it has been my worst experience of food in months!! The sun dried tomatoes very absolutely stale to an extent that they tasted bitter, the pizza base was so thick that it was uncooked and soggy, the four cheese blend tasted completely different than the last time and so did the pesto sauce.. No consistency with food quality.. I was starving and wanted to have a good meal but unfortunately it turned out to be a disaster..."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! Took the kids there for dinner Saturday night and the pizzas were great. We sat outside and had pizza & beer. The kids had fun walking around to the park across the street with a jazz concert going on after dinner. Great location for stuff going on and nice ambiance for a very informal dinner. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Ummmmmmmm. This place is The Deal. My boyfriend and I were in Charlotte for the weekend staying at the nearby Westin. We were craving pizza and I hopped on Yelp to find a good pie nearby. Followed the other reviews to this little joint tucked away in Charlotte's \"French Quarter\", and man, were we not disappointed. We ordered two of the menu pizzas, although the option to make your own with whatever you wanted was tempting. We went with both The Vampire Slayer and The Tripping Goat and two beers. Total was about $30 bucks which can't be beat. Both pizzas were so so so good. Would recommend this to anyone and everyone in Charlotte looking for some quality 'ZA! 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Discovered this place accidentally and I'm glad I did! Staff was super friendly. Pizza was phenomenal! I'll be making this spot one of my frequently visited. And they aren't hard on the pockets. P.S. get the honey drizzled on the crust. It's a game changer!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pizza perfection if you like made to order pizza. Perfectly sized to be a big meal or to share. Our family of 4, 2 kids, split a couple pizzas and were pleasantly satisfied. The Tree hugger and Meat Head made a nicely balanced lunch fornus.  My kids love any Coca Cola Freestyle drink machine, I can't they even guess the combo they concocted.  Za Blang also offers a small beer by the bottle selection.  You can sit inside at the communal tables or outside in the alley patio area.  We sat outside, it's shaded so even in summer you'll comfortable."}
{"text":"Walking into Zablong's is like being a kid in a candy shop!  I love the fact that you can choose as many or as little toppings as you want from their amazing selection, such as fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, housemade meatballs, spinach, etc. This place also suits those with different dietary concerns/restrictions as they offer gluten-free dough, vegetarian and vegan spreads/sauces, vegan mozzarella, and lots of veggie toppings. Oh and at the end, as an added bonus, you can choose EXTRA toppings (e.g. basil leaves, crumbled goat cheese) and drizzles (my favorites are the strawberry balsamic and fig marsala).  TIP: MAKE SURE YOU CREDIT CARD IS LINKED TO YELP!! IT'S 10% CASH BACK AT ZABLONG'S!   Also, make sure to note that they are closed on Sunday's, which I hope they will eventually change."}
{"text":"A little heavy on the cheese, but you can't beat a pizza that is custom made and ready in 3 minutes. BUT... I try to tip the super friendly employees and they tell me they can't accept tips and the cash I try to leave has to go in the register?  That will honestly keep me from going back. Anybody who has worked in the restaurant world knows that is bush league."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check out this popular pizza spot in Latta Arcade.  It was a late lunch so there was no crowd and I had time to put lots of thought into my creation.  I decided on a few toppings which all looked fresh, the staff was very helpful and great to talk to.  The pizza was done very quickly which is always a good look.  For me the pizza was just ok, nothing really stood out or was special about it.  Perhaps I'll give them another try at some point, but for now I'm just not getting the hype."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza embarrassingly late, and it was absolutely delicious. Portion was HUGE for just one person but was just the perfect size at 12:30 to help prevent my hangover the next day. Crust was to die for and the pizza was done lickity-split. Thank you Zablong for helping me in my time of need."}
{"text":"I mean $10 for an unlimited amount of toppings on a pizza!?! This place is great! service is fast. Kinda hipsters but i've seen plenty of families here.  Not much space for seating unless you don't mind getting cozy with random people.  Great concept, great price, great food!"}
{"text":"Love this place.. it's like the Chipotle of pizza. All the predetermined pizzas on the menu are great but I usually make my own with so so many toppings! It's enough for 2 meals for me, and it's open late which is great if you live in this area as many places around here are lunch only."}
{"text":"So I decided to try out this spot a few friends mentioned to me. I walked in and was happy there wasn't a long line especially during lunch peak hours. It was clean, the staff was friendly and the menu options to get started were good. It's so many options I didn't know where to start, so I just got The Woodstock and added chicken. It was amazinnnng!!! The price includes any and every topping, I'm adding shrimp to my pizza next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot in an alley, walkable from the Westin.  I ordered online through Yelp but their computer was down.  Expected to wait a long time, but was very pleasantly surprised how quickly it was ready.  They grab a lump of dough, put it through a press machine on the wall a couple times, then top it to order, put it on a timed conveyor belt oven, and it comes out perfectly cooked in a couple minutes.  Then they add flavored oils, and other fresh toppings as desired and then box it up for you. Boom. Fresh, delicious, fast, and cheap.  $10 for a pizza that easily feeds two.  Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"I love that you can choose a speciality pizza, customize a speciality, or make your own from scratch. I had pepperoni, roasted peppers, goat cheese and fresh basil with a drizzle of chili oil, and it was really delicious! The pizza is pretty large for one person, so the price is spot on. The area is cool too, and it's nice to sit outside and people watch. Can't wait to go back and try some other combinations."}
{"text":"Great pizza made fresh and super quick!  They also have spot to recycle pizza boxes which is helpful. Vampire slayer was very tasty!"}
{"text":"If you're from DC then you've heard of \"& pizza\". This place is identical to it just the Charlotte version. Great options and very fresh. The people who work here were super friendly and helpful when recommending which pizza to get. Their menu allows you to make your own or go from one of their speciality pizzas. Bf made his own and I got one from their menu (I really don't remember what it was called) and we both loved it! Came out hot and fresh and we chose to eat inside because it was raining but they do have outdoor seating. It's awesome that they're open until 3 am for those late night munchies after a night out! I highly recommend this place, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've now been here four times and haven't been disappointed once.  For $14 you can get a customized pizza (one is enough to split unless you're very hungry) and two fountain drinks, and if the weather is nice you can sit outside and enjoy a really great, hidden spot in the middle of uptown Charlotte.  This past visit I tried the \"Vampire Slayer\" and is was delicious.  Highly recommended for lunch or dinner on the way to a baseball game!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh I love this place. If you have a pizza craving this needs to be where you go! It's a customize your own pizza flatbread. They have so many toppings and it was probably the best pizza I've ever had!!! It's a small places but that's part of the charm of the place. I'll be returning about once a week so that should show you just how yummy in my tummy this place is!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Version: - Personalized weird shaped delicious pizzas dreams are made of - Great value given the variety and quality of the options (crust, sauce, toppings, etc.) - Quick. Filling. Delicious* ... unless you chose some weird stuff.  Long Winded Version:  Food: 6/5 If your pizza isn't delicious then odds are you only have yourself to blame. There's a ton of toppings to pick from so chose wisely ... or just pack on the meats like I do.   Location: 4/5 Pros: Surrounded by bars. Literally. Also right across from Romare Bearden park in case you're trying to get a mid-day picnic going. Cons: Street parking is a bit hard to find around there but there's some lots.  Atmosphere / Ambiance: 4.5/5 Pretty chill and laid back. Free Wi-Fi. Interactive TV with games. No outside seating but it's pretty bright and open. Customer Service is on point too (5/5). I've never had an experience with the staff there and I've been here during the day time like a normal human being and during the late night post bar shenanigans search food.   Quality: 5/5 You can make a solid scrumptious, mouth watering pizza here ... so what if it's not round. Think outside the box. Everyone I've brought here has enjoyed their 'za creation or one of the specialty pizzas on Zablong menu.  Review: 300 My 300th Review. That's it. K."}
{"text":"Alright!!!! My 50th review and Zablong's 100th review....  Straight up 5 stars and no less.  You just cannot go wrong with the pizza here because you can customize as you desire and also their signature pies are just as amazing. Love it Love it Love it.  Zablong has become our recent go-to place for a pizza (especially when craving for one).  For 10 bucks it feels like you get a great quality pie, with fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection, and portion sufficing two easy or one very hungry person, lol. Their uniqueness starts right from the basics, the shape of the pie.  Yes its not round its oblong. I love it when things get little off the traditional way.  Their website - it looks amazing and scrolling works sideways and up-down (may not be unique, but definitely different approach).  Their toppings - they have all the toppings that you can imagine.  Great meats (we tried only chicken so far), veggies, spices, dried and caramelized veggies, spicy oils, fruits, cheeses (including vegan).  Only place with so many different kinds of toppings and veggies we have been to so far.  Toppings are unlimited and one can build their pie as creative as possible or as hungry as one is, lol. Its open late - yepp big plus.  Its open pretty late in the weekends and when feeling guilty or need midnight food, you got a great place to go and for 10 bucks! This is our recent love and am sure will be one for a long time."}
{"text":"Shhhhh... I don't want my secret to get out... Zablong might be my favorite pizza place in Charlotte. Luckily, it's \"hidden\" away in the French Quarter. For less than $10, you get to customize your own pie with premium toppings. The choices are endless... Pork belly bacon, ghost pepper salami, prosciutto, caramelized onions... oh man... the list goes on! It's really easy to go overboard on the toppings, but I would recommend restraining yourself. Save yourself from a soggy pie and just go back for another. Pro tip: one pie was enough for at least 2 meals."}
{"text":"Echoing off of Bruce's review- Zablong is listed as one of the best pizzas in all of Charlotte - and although I wouldn't say it's the BEST pizza I've ever had, I have to admit that this is some pretty bomb pizza.   After admiring the long pizza boxes that nearly every Uptown worker carries daily I thought I would finally give Zablong a try. I mean I've worked in Uptown for 2 years now...  I tried it one Friday and popped in around 1:30. There wasn't a line, but if you come around 12/12:30 there is usually a line out the door. I ordered the Tripping Goat (from the menu), but added turkey meatballs and chicken to it. The Tripping Goat consistent of mushroom truffle oil, roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, fig marsala, crushed red pepper and salt/pepper. It was dynamite! The flavors were blended awesomely and they topped this bad boy up!  Unlike Blaze Pizza (ps I love Blaze), the crust was a little thicker and held your pizza together better. They have much fancier toppings than your usual pizza joint (think asiago cheese, pork belly, broccolini, prosciutto) and they aren't shy about loading up on toppings. My co-worker asked for a quote/un-quote \"Shi* ton of prosciutto\" on his pizza once and I think they gave him over a pound of it. No lie! It was ridiculous!  And for $10 a pizza you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place, it took me years to find a good pizza place in Charlotte. I'm upset i found out about this place after i didn't work in downtown anymore.  So anyways it's a local place, small but cute. It's in the French corner downtown to the right, it's around Likesome bars and other restaurants. I absolutely do love this place because it can't be beat for the awesome flavor and price.  cmon now it's like $10.99 for a pizza of your choice. Along with that you can add unlimited toppings for no extra price such as pork belly, shrimp, chicken, peppers, arugula, etc. It's a rectangular semi flatbread. So you can order a pizza of their choice, or build your own, or a pizza of their choice and add additional toppings. I definitely recommend it, i got the vampire slayer along with some extra toppings! I can't wait to go back and eat some more. It's a must every time i hit downtown."}
{"text":"Just left bc I was denied service, it says they close at 2am but I came at 1:55am and saw other people in there waiting. Guess the people there do not want the business to prosper."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Gourmet toppings, VERY vegan friendly, quick delivery, positive/fun staff, and great location. Perfect for after-work or an end of the night drop-in place.   Note to management: We came in at 6:30pm on 6.16.17 and the guys working were absolutely killing it. Big kudos. Helpful, upbeat, and made this experience great!"}
{"text":"Super impressed with this create your own pizza concept! There are several other similar places around town, and they've become recently popular, where you start with an unbaked crust and add your toppings before it's quickly baked. I think this is the best with the greatest variety and quality of toppings. I love that they offer wheat and gluten free crusts in addition to the typical crust, and that the toppings are unlimited. What really made it for me were the sauce options to drizzle at the end, I had the fig sauce and a bit of rosemary oil. So good! This place is great too because it can fulfill a wide range of dietary needs, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, you name it."}
{"text":"Pizza looked great. Great reviews. Called multiple times to no answer. Tried the website, it didn't work.   UPDATE:  A manager reached out to me and assured the situation was being worked on. Nice guy and he invited me back to have a slice. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever tried.  I moved here from Chicago where is famous with Chicago pizza.  However this place is the 1st now. I tried create my own, with mushroom truffle as base. Never ever tasted this flavor. So good. It deserves a try you won't disappointed."}
{"text":"Fully customizable flat bread pizza with enough options to please almost anyone. Prices are awesome and the atmosphere is full of good vibes.  I highly recommend finishing your pizza with the red pepper oil.... Amazing if you have pesto basil sauce!   Kid-friendly... Wet-erase markers for them to mark freely on the clear-top tables.   Best pizza place I've been to in Charlotte so far...."}
{"text":"I had experienced Zablong once before when I was at Courtyard Hooligans for a USMNT match and a friend brought one in. As many of the other reviews have mentioned, that night was a little hazy, but I remember the 'za being delicious. I also did not realize that anyone else referred to it as 'za. I'm giving it a sixth star for that alone!  They have a great assortment of different straight-from-the-menu options, or a build your own option. I took the easy route and ordered the \"Southern Comfort\" from the menu. Topped with pork belly bacon, garlic puree, and (delicious) sweet corn, it really hit the spot. As far as the generalities of the pizza, it is more of a flat bread cut into eight pieces. Easy to make two meals or a meal and a snack out of it.   The French Quarter and Latta Arcade are definitely underrated spots to grab a bite and a drink, but I believe Zablong is a stand-out among those!"}
{"text":"I have anticipated the opening of this restaurant since Charlotte Agenda posted their article a few weeks ago. I was not disappointed today. I went with a group of coworkers at lunch and the place was packed. I liked the decor and the layout but it is a small space and the line is hard to form past the door but once you get situated and moving everything moves pretty quickly from there. I ordered the Southern Comfort pizza. All the ingredients were fresh, the dough was great and the portion was enough for dinner tonight. While waiting for our pizza my coworkers and I took a selfie on their big screen tv and emailed the picture to ourselves.. Great feature while waiting. After the pizza comes out the oven you are able to add finally ingredients. I added BBQ sauce to mine. I couldn't finish my pizza but wanted to in one sitting. I will be back for more pizza !"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Friday night spot. I work for a local pizza place and Zablongs is not your ordinary pizza joint. While the space is small, they make good use of every inch opening it up with community tables. I get the southern comfort with extra pork belly, add ghost pepper pepperoni and  finished with prosciutto. Amazing! There is no additional charge for extra toppings! This place is gonna be busy this spring and summer. My only complaint is they need a tip jar. The staff is beyond friendly!"}
{"text":"Sorry but I think this place is somewhat overrated. It's not a bad pizza but nothing special. Service was great and it's nice to grab a pizza and hit one of the bars nearby."}
{"text":"Zablong Peculiar Pizza. I actually spent time researching the definition of Zablong or Zab even to understand the origins of this peculiar name. I had no real luck but the pizza is long and rectangular so I am going with that. What else is peculiar is that you stand at the counter and pick your crust type (white, wheat or gluten free) and your sauce and toppings (much like a subway) and then they send it through a toaster looking deal - (like Quiznos)! I actually had my first experience of this concept pizza at the Washington DC Ronald Reagan Airport at a place called '& Pizza'. Zablong seemed a bit bigger and more filing but the crust and sauce were not quite as good. The atmosphere and Vibe in Zablong was very hip. The wall was brick and had a cool painted mural and there where sharpies on each table and you could write on the wall."}
{"text":"Nice spot! Clean! Great pizza with FRESH ingredients! From the dough, chicken, tomato sauce and vegetables all ingredients were very fresh! Make me wonder if they have a little garden in the back! The veggies were so good my six year old ate them. We shared a pizza. It was BYOP we chose chicken, spinach, red onion, cheese blend, classic sauce, arugula mushrooms and topped it off with fresh mozzarella! I get my eyebrows done a couple of doors down and never noticed the place until today! So glad I paid attention because I have truly been missing out! I so will be going back for lunch as I work uptown! Spreading the word to the coworkers! Pizza about $10 pick all the toppings you want!"}
{"text":"Super friendly employees and really unusual pizza. I've had it second hand before (as in my friends catered a get together with it, and it was barely lukewarm when we ate it, but most people other than myself were too drunk to care), so I went to the source to try some different stuff fresh out of the oven... but they don't do slices, so I haven't been able to try any hot and fresh yet. The cold-ish slices were around 4 star but they intrigued me, however they should really sell pizza by the slice here, if only for my benefit.  When they say Zablong, it sort of means Oblong, I guess, because that's the shape of the pizza. They remind me of the shape of Beaver Tails in Ottawa. Couldn't taste more different though. The Vampire Slayer was amazing at the party except that nobody who had eaten anyone could make out with anyone afterwards, no amount of mints and teeth-brushing can fix that damage.  One thing I'm not crazy about is having all the toppings laid out in front of you like a Cali-style pizza spot, or a Subway or something. It just reminds me of Chipotles and Millennials. Not that there's anything wrong with Millennials, but a lot of that sort of food, to me, is garbage. This place is not, so don't get distracted by the format. It's really good pizza. I'm not ready to give it 5 stars yet though.  Apparently Za is pizza and Blong is belonging. But I still think it's connected to the oblong nature of the pizza.  Anyway I'm off to listen to the Linkin Park song, Somewhere I Blong."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy your pizza and recommend it to my friends when they're visiting, but I've come to your uptown location twice, in the past four days, and the location is closed before 10PM.  The first evening, it was 9:47PM...I get it, business is probably slow and the employees just want to go home.  Tonight?  I call the location two times, around 9:20PM and get no answer (should've been an indicator, I know...but, I was hopeful).  My husband and I decide to walk, in the rain, to your location and find everything on the bar to be covered and an employee washing up.  The \"Open\" sign was turned off and, this time, I arrived by 9:30pm.  I just want your damn farmhand pizza (the sh*t is delicious!) and I'm willing to endure the rain for a taste.  If you're not going to be open until 10PM, can you at least change your business hours?   Sincerely,  Hangry Customer"}
{"text":"My coworker had his pizza (which looked amazing) and a few more of us decided to go. It was our first time and we're not disappointed! This pizza was amazing, a lot of toppings for a great price! You will not be disappointed. They were very friendly and helped us through a first time journey! Will definitely be back soon! Possibly a once a week spot!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. I love that you walk in and get to order your own personal pizza and it's ready within 5 minutes! The prices are also great! Every drunken persons dream, being as they're open until 3am."}
{"text":"Lunch food - not gourmet. Perfect for a weekday lunch at the office, quick service and great variety"}
{"text":"This is the chipotle of pizza, except better since there are no up charges for toppings and extra meat. Good variety and choice of sauces and toppings. Prices are resonable given the size of the pizzas, just be ready to wait if you are trying to come during regular lunch hours"}
{"text":"Brevard Court is home to some of the best spots in Charlotte, and Zablong is no exception. This pizza joint offers custom made pizzas made with fresh ingredients and friendly service. I honestly can't recommend one thing because everything is good. Make your pizza however you like it, it's gonna taste  good. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The meat eaters pizza.  Extraordinarily delightful. Could only eat 3 pieces but my late night craving with be happy to oblige this leftover!!!! Netflix, here I come!  At $10 for multigrain, $1 more for gluten free, who can argue?"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place!!? Polite workers, phenomenal pizza with unlimited toppings, and a cool atmosphere. If the weather is good you can grab your pizza and sit in the park.   All pizzas are individually sized for someone extra hungry or enough for 2 if you aren't gonna be a fatty. Everything has 1 price and the toppings include everything from falafel to prosciutto to meatballs.   Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"The pizzas were delicious and came out quickly. We enjoyed sitting out outside to eat. The Meat Head and Tree Hugger pizzas were excellent. I hope to see pizza places like this become more prevalent."}
{"text":"Zablong is HANDS DOWN my favorite pizza place in all of Charlotte. I was diagnosed with Celiac disease in June of last year and I searched everywhere to find a pizza place that had a gluten free crust that actually tasted like pizza. Zablong was recommended to me by a friend and I will never get my pizza from anywhere else in Charlotte. The pizzas are massive (enough to split between two people easily), taste delicious, and are super affordable (only $1 for GF upcharge...that's amazing). The staff there is always super friendly and they even take extra precautions if you tell them that you have an allergy. The only thing that I would change is that there would be more locations around the city, so I could eat there more often!"}
{"text":"Sad I had to leave leftovers uneaten! Thankfully many spots closed early Saturday night to prepare to open early on Sunday. Zablong was one of the few nearby eating options and I'm glad for it! The staff was super personable, very quick & efficient and everyone enjoyed their pizzas. Demolished all but 3 slices, but with going to the game Sunday then hitting the road to head home (CHS) after, it would be too long unrefrigerated to be able to take the leftovers. You could easily split one pizza btwn two people but getting your own is even better if you can enjoy the leftovers!"}
{"text":"I have developed this new love in my life that is in the form of Zablong.  This is by far my favorite pizza in uptown and I want everyone in my life to know about it.  From saying the name (just say it, \"Zablong!\"), to creating your own masterpiece, to the cheesy goodness and crust, this place hits the nail on the head with the entire experience.  The spicy tomato sauce is so flavorful and delicious, even for a gal who can't do spicy.  Try the Vampire Slayer with Angry Tomato sauce or The Southern Comfort and add shrimp.  I see big things for this place in the near future!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  The staff was so nice, the choices were plentiful, the price was right, and most importantly, delicious!!  Wishing they had a location near me in Columbia."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place because the original place we were going for lunch was closed, and I'm SO glad we did! Pizza was fantastic! I love that you can add as much as you want and mix and match for just one price. We will be back....many times!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite customizable pizza place in Charlotte. It's located in Latta Arcade so great spot for lunch if you work in Uptown! Quick and A+ service! This restaurant is also known as Peculiar Pizza. What sets this pizza shop apart from the others (such as Blaze, firestorm, Firenza, etc.) is that they have toppings available before and after your pizza goes through the oven. In addition they have the best toppings overall with a huge selection of quality ingredient, sauces, drizzles, and cheeses! They also have whole wheat (as well as traditional and GF) crust! One order is plenty and you can even have some for dinner! Only thing that's not great is the parking situation if you're out of walking distance but it makes for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"$9.29 for all the topping you want! Tried this place (or one very similar to it) in DC late last year. So, when I saw people walking around with the distinct rectangular boxes, I made short work of tracking down it's new location (which happens to be in the French Quarter behind Latta Arcade). As with the place I ate at in DC, they have a menu with a few signature pizzas. But don't let that limit your creativity. Because on the other side of the menu, for the exact same price they list all of their sauces and toppings. I think you could eat here every day for a year and still not get through all of the possible topping combinations. On this day I had a regular crust (they have multi grain and gluten free too) with tomato sauce and pesto basil spread. From there I was like a kid in a candy store with the toppings adding both some delicious meats and veggies on there. At the end, my pizza was piled higher than I originally intended but for the same reasonable price. This place should be a must try, must re-visit option. Don't get me wrong, it's not THE best pizza in the city, but it's a great lunch or dinner. And with all of the variety, a place you will never get bored of, and should always leave satiated."}
{"text":"I am slightly obsessed with this place. Since its opening there have been many a rectangle boxes in our office. Every time I go I get half and half to attempt to try everything once. My favorite so far is the southern comfort with corn and pork belly bacon (YUM)! The staff is friendly and patient while I take forever to make pizza decisions and the toppings are fun and delicious. It's a great little place in French quarter and I find myself craving this place every couple weeks. Their sauces are creative and tasty, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This is a make-your-own pizza spot located in Latta Arcade. Great location and tasty pizza. What makes it unique is the various toppings you can choose from: various types of meat, cheeses, tomato based sauces, oils, glaze and veggies. The staff was very friendly. The shop itself is small, but there is outdoor seating. There is an interactive monitor you can take and post pictures with while you're there as well. If you are ever in the Romare Bearden Park area and don't feel like packing a picnic , I recommend this reasonably priced spot."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  The food is good and the options are endless.  This got 3 stars instead of 4 because of the speed.  The model makes the process quite slow and time-consuming.  If the line is more than a few folks, be prepared to wait a long time.  I don't blame the staff for this, it's just the process of making customizable, fresh pizza.  The staff was friendly and paying was quick.  The portion sizes are massive and I can never finish my pizza.  This is really good, but I would like if they had a smaller option too.  The price is appropriate for the portion and location.  Overall, a good place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"Yum, I love the tripping goat and the farmhand :) the service is generally good. I've only had one guy that was a little rude and messed up my pizza which was a tad bit too greasy due to way too much sauce. However, that could never ruin the amazing food and the above average service from the other people that work here."}
{"text":"This place is a great go-to for lunch and dinner or later at night. Tons of Healthy and unhealthy topping options. If you're familiar with Blaze Pizza or &Pizza, this is like that for Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place has consistently good pizza. The staff is friendly and will customize your pizza to your liking. Definitely the best pizza value in the area. The only downside is that there is only one size. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Came here based off the reviews here and, yes, These pizzas are amazing! The following pizzas were ordered:   The Vampire Slayer The Southern Comfort The Greek Philosopher  The Meathead  All of the pizzas were absolutely tasty. However, The Southern Comfort pizza knocked me out! It is a delicious mix of cheese, corn and yes, PORK BELLY BACON!*insert smile*...I am not even really a bacon eater. But, this bacon right here? Perfect. Add carmelized onions and green peppers with a BBQ drizzle, and you have an award-winning pizza...okay, a bit subjective, but surely on someone's top ten pizza list somewhere (mine included)  All pies were 9.29 (1.00 extra for gluten free) and you can get all the toppings you want.  The staff was extremely helpful and patient towards people who probably should have googled the online menu before making life decisions in the pizza line, lol...just saying  The vibe is laid back. Seating is indoor and outdoor. However, it is small. But, on a nice day, you can picnic in Romare Bearden park across the street...or bring it home and try to fight the urge of not touching before you get to your house, lol..."}
{"text":"very good pizza at a cheap price - unlimited quality toppings.  located in Latta Arcade in Uptown Charlotte.  Blong gets very busy between 1130am-130pm."}
{"text":"Ok pizza. Soft crust. Needs more indoor seating because the pizza boxes take up most of the tables.   Also it's freaking cold when they leave the doors open in the winter!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to concur with many of my fellow Yelpers.  Zablong is Da Bomb!    My wife and I were hanging at the Wooden Robot and had a hankering for Pizza.  I pulled out my trusty Yelp and Zablong popped up.  It was a bit of a drive in the wrong direction, but I was in the mood for a good pizza.  The establishment itself is little more than a hole in the wall with a few rows of tables separated from the baking area by a single wall.  There is some outdoor seating too.  Ultimately we chose to sit outside because it was a nice evening.    Their Pizza concept is simple.  Pizzas come in one size: 18\".  They have several signature pies or you can create your own.  The Prize is $9.29 no matter what: Makes choosing their toppings a no stress proposition.    I had intended to create my own concoction, but when I saw their Southern Comfort signature pizza, I was sold.  It has Southern Cream, Garlic Purée, Mozzarella, Sweet Corn, Pork Belly Bacon, and Fresh Basil. Perfection!  You automatically get 8 slices and that turned out to be just the right amount for me and my wife.    So, if you're alright with braving the construction and finding a parking place in downtown, then trying out Zablong's is a no brainier.  In fact, it's a Yes Brainer!   5 for aesthetics, 5 for service, 5 for taste, and 1 for location (That's just me...I hate driving into town).  I give them 5 stars for an absolutely awesome experience.  Despite the time it took to get there and home, I'll brave the traffic to try them out again.  Mucho Kudos!"}
{"text":"Pizza is one of my guilty pleasures and this place does it right. Fresh ingredients, thin crispy crust, make your own or have one that is tastefully designed on the menu, regardless you will enjoy! Good Pizza is hard to find in Charlotte so Zalong is a great addition to the dt area!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place while on a business trip. Searched in Yelp and found this to be an interesting choice for pizza. I was not disappointed! Endless toppings... at no additional cost. Staff was friendly, and the seating area outside was pretty awesome. Right in the middle of other cool restaurants and shops. I definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"One word- treehugger!! Pure perfection. Linch crowd moves pretty fast, friendly and prompt service, all round awesome !!"}
{"text":"Came here after reading the reviews on yelp.  Pizza is great!  Off beat combos or build your own.  Only hit I have is limited seating.  Outside alley seating is very nice."}
{"text":"I had seen this place featured on some Charlotte afternoon talk show along with a few other places and where the pizza looked good on TV, it was the online menu that sucked me in! Goat cheese, pork belly, puréed garlic! Sign me up! We recently found ourselves on that side of town (directly across from the Knights baseball stadium) so we knew we had to go. This place is tucked into an alley so Street parking isn't all that easy; I recommend going ahead and parking in the parking deck. The restaurant is very small and you order your pizza pretty much the same way you order from Subway or Moe's. Everything is right in front of you and they just pile it on...my husband got the meat eater and it's pretty normal- nothing out of the ordinary there but why go to a place like this and get something you can get anywhere?! That's like going to Baskin Robbins and getting vanilla! I settled on the Southern Comfort...a sweeter Alfredo sauce, cheese, basil, pork belly and corn. Added caramelized  onions and the girl making the pizza suggested I put some Italian sausage on it - sure why not! She also said \"I know this is gonna sound strange but when it's done, let me drizzle some honey on two pieces and see if you like it\" Honey? On a Pizza? Ok, I'm game...what a game changer! Omg! Wow! I can't even tell you how good it is- I'm glad she suggested it because I would NEVER have done something like that! This place is worth the hint to find! I promise you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Basically if you like watching someone with a dirty rag wipe the 'toppings' counter and push a bunch of dirty food/toppings back into the food containers than disregard this 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Soooo... I've seen the pictures and I've heard the conversations and tonight I had the chance to try it for myself! Though the name is different now {Peculiar Pizza} the pizza was phenomenal! They allowed me to taste the different red sauces, I liked the peanut one but I decided to stick with classic. I placed so many yummy toppings on it and coated my pizza with CHEESE !!!  In the oven for 7minutes and while I waited I played Sudoku on the tv screen {very cool because it took my mind off my serious hunger pain lol}. Before I knew it my pizza was READY. The guy recommended additional toppings at the end and I couldn't say no... that would be CRAY CRAY!   People if you haven't already check out Peculiar Pizza {or whatever the name will be when you go lol}. Just check it out I'm sure the pizza style won't change!   You're WELCOME!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least a dozen times, and I'm always pleased.   When it first opened last year, I was skeptical. I didn't appreciate the gimmick of oblong pizza. I felt like the name was dumb. I wasn't crazy about people describing it as \"Chipotle, but for pizza.\"  Those things are all true, but Zablong is worth your time and your ten dollars.   Even when the line is long -- which it often is during lunchtime -- you're in and out in a reasonable amount of time. Your pizza is custom-made and the ingredients are well-curated. The employees are attentive and efficient. The patrons are all so happy to get a tasty pizza that even the wait time is pleasant.   It's easy to dine gluten free or with other dietary restrictions. The menu is clear about what's safe for different diets. My favorite part is that the GF upcharge is modest (just $1) and when you ask for a gluten free crust, the employee helping you will ask \"Is this an allergy or a preference?\" If you, like me, have Celiac disease, each person down the line will change their gloves and use designated utensils. They take cross-contamination very seriously at Zablong. I so appreciate the extra effort.   The menu changes slightly and seasonally almost each time I visit. I hope they bring back the horseradish cream sauce; it's a real delight!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and I really wish we had one of these back in Saint Petersburg! This place is awesome and the pizza is yummy. Portion is plenty, in my opinion. We each only ate half of our pizzas and were full. Another awesome thing is that they are EXTREMELY friendly to dietary restrictions, with everything on the menu of toppings marked as vegetarian and vegan. They also have a gluten free crust option (+$1) and it was REALLY good. Not at all soggy or crumpling or too crispy as some GF crusts can be. It's a flat rate to build your own pizza, which is perfect for my husband and I, who have quite different pizza tastes. Out the door with leftovers for under $25. I don't know why there wasn't a line out the door and packed tables, to be honest. I would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch!! The pizza is so fresh, and they offer so many toppings they truly have a pizza for everyone!!  This would be a good stop on the weekend if you're in Romare Bearden park!  They have so many options, from crust, to sauce, topppings, and garnishes, you can't go wrong!!  I love the angry tomato sauce, its a little spicy but delish.  The people that work here are just the right amount of upbeat and personable it's a cool spot."}
{"text":"What a fun place this is!  Zablong is a great value and in a fun spot too.  They are tucked down the alley leading out of latta arcade near the baseball stadium near the french quarter.  You can get any sauce, any toppings and a choice of three crusts for no additional charge.  The crust is good, I had the multigrain, nice and nutty flavor, then i loaded it up with basically every meat I could find!  It only takes a few minutes to cook then it is time to eat!  The quality of ingredients is top notch, I love the add ons like basil oil and chile oil too!  This is a great spot for kids, late night and a random tuesday night too!  Check it out."}
{"text":"This place is great for a last minute, I don't feel like cooking, kind of night. I lvie pretty close to uptown, so the location is convenient. Parking is the only hard part due to it being in Latta Arcade. Since I don't want to pay for the garages, I usually have to circle around the blocks a few times to find street parking. Events in Romare Bearden Park also make this more difficult.  That being said, once you find parking, getting food from here is pretty low effort. You can order one of their set menu items or make your own. Items are less like a pizza, more like a flatbread, so don't go expecting a NY slice. What I really like about this place is the unique combos of toppings. One item has meatballs and strawberry balsamic on it. The Greek Philospher has a chickpea spread and falafel on it! Another, my personal favorite, is the Woodstock (minus the jalapenos).   It's quick, it's easy, and it's good. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza spot. Little bit like mellow mushroom but with  oblong personal pizza size and wheat crust options. Great taste and make your own options. Fast and order at counter style! Location in the French district area conveniently Ent after a few drinks at the bars next door."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for pizza in Charlotte. Enough said.  - You either BYO (Build-Your-Own) or choose one of their signature pies. - Pizzas are built in-front of you. Perfectly assembled. I had many pies already, and it rarely hit a false note. - Then baked in conveyor oven. - Fresh toppings are added for the finishing touches. - The tripping goat is to die for (without the crumbled goat cheese for me.) I don't want the poor goat to trip. - Pay flat rate ($9.79+tax.)  Why you should embrace Zablong? - Best part about a night of drinking, is the eating after. It's pretty predictable, and my favorite is always yummy PIZZA. So going over to Zablong for a pie before the night is over, is a good idea. Trust me. Zablong last call around 2:30am Fridays and Saturdays. - Perfect for quick lunch. - Vegan and vegetarian options are available. - Location. Location. Location. At Latta arcade.   Five Yelps."}
{"text":"I see on Yelp this place is getting 5 out of 5 stars, and I 100% agree.  If you like a pizza with a lot of fresh toppings, this is your spot.  For a little over $9 you load your pizza with as much as you want, and then when its all done baking, you load on the final post baked ingredients (i.e. fresh basil, olives, arugula, olive oil, etc), the way it should be done.  Great crust, lots of different sauces, and it's a BIG pie,  you could eat the whole thing, but don't, that's probably way too many calories.    Only 1 Suggestion, and it might be a Million Dollar idea.  The wait can get a bit backed up, and that's inevitable, UNLESS, you pump some money into an online ordering system or simple kiosk ordering system and just let people mosey on up when they are ready to pick up their pizza.    Great Pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza option! They even have vegan cheese and gluten free crust. Not super expensive and a single pizza can feed two easy. We go here often!"}
{"text":"Good food, right price point, and great staff.  Anything and everything you want on your pizza for a set price, and quality ingredients -- fresh cherry tomatoes and spinach, several meats and sausages, sauces, etc.  The kicker was the staff. I went at a slow time and one worker was making a pizza for himself.  It looked great; we got to talking and it's clear he enjoyed testing every combination of flavors. Next time I go back, I might just get him to make me whatever he thinks is a good combination, like when you go to a good cocktail place and tell them your taste and then see what they surprise you with.  Solid 5 stars, but of course, the staff will probably change regularly at a place like this, so stay tuned."}
{"text":"Finally went to check out what I've decided is Charlotte's unique pizza.  It was awesome.  For under $11, I got a pizza customized with two different sauces, unlimited toppings--each half-and-half, a $#1t-ton of cheese, and falafel and fig.  Seriously amazing.  Two adults were both totally, totally full.  Too full to even think about ice cream (which as butterfinger and chocolate sounded like a great idea BEFORE we sat down to eat but several hours later we still are stuffed).  The shape makes it really nice to customize as a half-and-half or to split with someone else.  And I love the thin crust and tons of cheese.  This is absolutely going to be my go-to pizza when I'm in the area (i.e., at home and not at work).  Lost a star because the server was incredibly difficult to hear and understand.  But aside from not knowing exactly what everything was or how it all worked, after one round I'm comfortable enough to say I've got the hang of it.  Still wish I knew better what was in all of the sauces and what, exactly, each of the different meats were, but I'll just try them all eventually I guess."}
{"text":"Stopped into Zablong for some late night food on our Saturday in Charlotte. We ended up splitting The Vampire Slayer signature pie with a few substitutes for some missing ingredients.   Quality Zablong has a reputation across the city of Charlotte as the late night spot. And its not just because of its hours or prime location, it actually turns out some solid pizza. I decided to go with one of their signature pies, The Vampire Slayer. This pizza uses a roasted garlic puree and ricotta spread as its sauces, and then loads it with peculiar cheese blend, ghost pepper salami, basil leaves, and black pepper. Unfortunately on this evening they were out of the ghost pepper salami, which was the main draw for me. They replaced it with pepperoni, but it was definitely much less exciting. The pizza itself was good, maybe a little heavy in the center, but the crust had a great crisp on the edges. I enjoyed the unique sauces used, which gave a nice twist instead of the standard tomato based sauce. And it was absolutely packed with cheese, a big plus as far as I'm concerned. I get the draw as it is a snack that can definitely soak up some alcohol, but I imagine it is also quite tasty during other hours of the day too.  Quantity The pizzas come in an oblong shape that are about 18 inches long and 6 inches wide. It was more than enough for the two of us to share, though most people on line looked ready to devour their own.  Value The signature pies all cost $11, which is not a bad deal for the size and quality of the pizza. You can also definitely maximize the value by throwing on extra toppings.  Ambiance Zablong is located in the Uptown area of Downtown Charlotte. It is part of Latta Arcade a pedestrian only street lined with bars and restaurants. On a weekend evening the area was packed with people. Zablong stands out with its bright neon sign hanging out from the brick building. They have seating outside, but by the time we arrived it was a free for all. It seemed like most of the tables were being used by non-customers. When you enter the restaurant you are met by a staircase. You make your way to the right where the pizza creation station flows. Customers can go down the line designing their dream pizza or select a pre-designed pie. When you come out the other end they have a few inside tables along a graffiti wall. This area was also packed, but at least with pizza eaters here. The music blaring and the vibes good, but a little crazy.  Crowd Saturday night meant a line out the door. Right smack in the middle of a busy bar area, Zablong is the go to lack night munchies spot. Everyone on line was some level of inebriated, with more than a few struggling to even stand. This also meant a lot of indecisive customers, really slowing down the process.  Service The guys slinging the pizzas could very easily have been on the other side of the glass. They all seemed eager to head out to the bars at the end of the shifts and were asking some of the customers where the party was at. And while this laid back attitude made them perfect for dealing with the unruly customers, it meant that no one was refilling ingredients and mistakes were numerous.  Parking The area is populated with bars and therefore drunk pedestrians, so I would not necessarily recommend driving to the area. But if you do there was some street parking as well as a few parking garages nearby.  Extra Through all the chaos, Zablong definitely has some solid pizza. But dealing with the crowds and the inattentive staff is a less than enjoyable experience. If you know what you are getting into though, the end result is worth it."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is awesome! Quick, tasty and cheap? Yes, please!!  Choose your crust (I like multigrain), choose your sauce (angry tomato is my fave), pick a cheese (quatrro formaggi pleaseandthankyou) and then decide on alllllll the toppings. You can get one topping or twenty, matters not to the cashier. Your pizza creation is going to be $10 no matter what you tell the kind man behind the counter to throw on top.   My favorite toppings are meatballs, caramelized onions and mushrooms pre-bake. Once it's out of the oven, there are additional toppings available. On that side of things, I usually go with an oil drizzle, parmesan or asiago, arugula, sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto. Are you drooling yet?!?"}
{"text":"Peculiar Pizza Please and Thank You!  Zablong's is tucked into the Latta Arcade... Probably one of the most things I miss about working right off of Tryon, is coming to the arcade and all the lunch options during the day.  The \"inner\" locations are probably very easy to miss, unless you are seeking out places.  The last time I went to Zablong, I don't remember a staircase, but that could just be me... I felt like there was another tenant upstairs that had the staircase in the center, but whatev's it's there - but don't go up.  You walk in and decide on your crust style... then go down the assembly line.  You can either do a signature pizza creation or customize your own.  I usually do a half and half signature pizza and add on whatever I feel like.  Farmhand is definitely the way to go... they also have the pizza for goat cheese lovers (which is also amazing).  Servers are really nice and make sure your pizza is just the way you want it.  After the pizza is assembled, it makes its way through the oven and you get to customize it even more!  Chili Flakes, Cheese, Oil, are just some of the options located on the other side of the oven.  Beers in bottles here... soda machine.  They will pour your bottle into a plastic cup for ya.  After you've paid, make your way \"under\" the stairs and into the dining area with some communal tables.  They do have some outdoor tables as well.  I'd imagine this place gets packed during lunch... but we were there for dinner and it was super cool sitting inside and looking at the graffiti brick wall."}
{"text":"Was looking for a spot to satisfy our late night pizza craving when my girlfriend and I came across this spot. Loved every bit of it! The customer service was superb and the pizza matched the quality of service! We loved the fact that we could customize our own pizza and were not charged for the toppings! The location is central to Romare Bearden Park and Latta Plantation. Support this establishment!"}
{"text":"I loved ordering a custom pizza at Zablong in Charlotte, NC. As someone with a cow's milk allergy, it was fantastic to have a pizza made that I could eat without digestive distress- and it was delicious, too!  It was a regular crust, fiery tomato sauce, vegan mozzerella, pepperoni, ghost pepper sausage, and red pepper, then topped (after firing) with chevre, arugala, and balsamic.  One of my teens also had a custom built pizza and the other had \"the Vampire Slayer\", and both were very satisfied."}
{"text":"ZaBlong has a very unique meaning behind their name and their pizza really is amazing.   So you decide what you want on your pizza, starting with dough (they do have gluten free), different sauce, and any toppings for $10.  It's really really good, so grab pizza, a beer and sit by the park."}
{"text":"Friends in DC have been raving about this make your own style pizza place and i was a bit jealous!! So glad to have been introduced to this cute spot by a friend.  The pizza was amazing and the staff were great as well.  Also had the pleasure of meeting one of the co-owners (Tas) who came out to make sure everything was to our liking!  I've already recommended to friends who live in Charlotte, and i'll definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This place is my new obsession. I went on a Thursday night around 7:30 PM and experienced no line. The staff is very friendly. I can't believe they charge a flat rate for each pizza regardless of the toppings - adding Italian meatballs and prosciutto doesn't cost a thing! The toppings are all very high quality and the pizza is delicious. Only improvement I think they could make is having wine as a drink option in addition to beer."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza joint in Charlotte! The quality makes it hard to eat any other pizza in the area. The most fresh ingredients and at an affordable price! Not to mention the service -employees make you feel right at home. I highly recommend eating here at least 3 times a week!!"}
{"text":"Love love love!!  Difficult to find, but glad we did. We were uptown for  concert at the knight theater and did not have a lot of time to grab dinner before the show. This was walking distance of the theater, they were quick, an inexpensive option for uptown, but best of all delicious and unique pizza! They offered a vegan cheese that made my dairy free son very happy!  Will def come here again when uptown and don't want to do the fine dining."}
{"text":"Conclusion from finally checking this place off my bookmarks list: Never want to eat other pizza without ghost pepper salami as long as I live.   Cool spot in Brevard court, indoor and outdoor seating. We got there about 11:30 on a Saturday so not much going on. The staff was super friendly and made sure to ask if it was our first time so they could give us a lay of the land.   So many topping choices it's overwhelming. Went with the Woodstock and added ghost pepper salami. Solid choice, but everything on the menu looked pretty good. I liked that they placed the toppings evenly so each of the slices had the same amount of toppings. And as everyone says, you can get as many toppings as you want and it's still a $10 pizza. Pretty cool. I even made 2 meals out of mine."}
{"text":"What do you get if you add \"za\" (the hip way to address your pie) to \"blong\" (the utterly unknown way to address a sense of belonging)? Zablong, of course! While this may or may not make any sense to anyone, it's what they're going with, and it's their party, so stay along for the ride.  Apparently everyone who is anyone is now picking up on the plan from those Seinfeld episodes where you can cook your own pizza (except you cannot actually do the own cooking as of yet), but you can at least choose your own toppings, and Zablong is one of the latest to get in on the trend. To make it even cooler, they have shoe-horned their place into a closet. Really, it looks like you are under the stairs at times. Go to one side to get your pie going, the other to sit and eat, if there is room.  As to the pie itself - it's not a huge difference from Blaze or Pie Five, but the shape is different, and the ingredients are a bit fresher to boot. Is it the best in Charlotte? Probably not (sorry). But is it the best build-your-own? Very likely. As with most of these places, it depends on what you put on there. The good thing about Zablong is that it's a larger pizza than many places, so you can easily share it - with your friend, your date, or whoever happens to sit at your table. Or just keep it to yourself and save it for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a flat bread pizza based off reviews. Disappointment at its finest. The idea is the same as a chain food restaurant. They only had three flavors of beer and all of them were unknown to a beer drinker. Ordered the Vampire pizza with fresh jalapeños. Without the jalapeños it was a soggy pizza with rosemary olive oil to moisten it down more. Luckily, we split the pizza and now can hunt for some alcohol to wash the pizza Taste out of our mouth."}
{"text":"My husband went here for lunch and gave me some leftovers. He was raving about this place about how you can get as many toppings as you want for about $9. He showed me his leftover pizza and I laughed because there was an insane amount of toppings on it! The pizza was really good. The toppings he got on it was similar to a chicken supreme pizza. Toppings tasted fresh and the pizza sauce was really good. I can't wait to actually go to this place and have my own pizza!"}
{"text":"Loved it! We were picking up suiting across the way and decided to have lunch here. I had the garlicky chicken vampire slayer pizza and he made his own. Both were fresh and delicious. I like the concept of choosing all the toppings down the line and watching the pizza slowly come out of the oven! So many choices and what a deal. We easily could have shared one pizza and had a meal for $9. Try them out!"}
{"text":"What a concept! This fast casual pizza concept is going to take off. Choose your pizza or create your own every pizza is $9.29 regardless of how you dress it. You order you crust, base, cheese and main toppings and the process kicks off. As you walk down the line watching your Flatbread get put together you see it get put in the oven. By the time the people in front of you pay and walk off your personal pizza is coming out of the oven and finished with fresh ingredients or flavored oils. You pay and you walk off at the same time with your pizza. Easily can finish the pizza or take half of it home. Plenty of food.   Check out the video wall as you wait in line and take a selfie or play a game as you wait."}
{"text":"Dear Zablong, you are my life saver late night when I have consumed a few too many adult beverages and you are also equally delicious on sober days when I am in need of lunch.   The two best things about this place: they are open until 3am on the weekends and three words: ghost pepper salami. Seriously, GHOST.PEPPER.SALAMI.  Zablong is a fast casual type concept where you can order from their menu or build your own. There is a laundry list of toppings. No matter how you want it, it's the same price. Less than $10. My current strategy here is to get the Meathead with angry sauce and add mushrooms, jalapenos, pineapple, sundried tomatoes, and crushed red pepper oil. What can I say, I'm a toppings whore. For the vegans out there, they have a lot of great options to fit your desires. For me, I can turn into a pizza into two meals.   The workers are always super friendly and happy, which is a lot to say when you're open until 3am and dealing with drunk people. They probably all deserve hugs and holidays named in their honor.   Zablong, thank you for being the spot Latta Arcade and the alley has needed. You are doing God's work over there."}
{"text":"I love this place. Besides the fact I love pizza, they have some many options. I got the pizza with the angry tomatoes (a little spicy) but it was delicious. I went during lunch so it was busy but the line was steady consider it was lunch."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza if you like to build your own topping. Great food for the price. Really worth of trying in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"You know, with the doughy undercooked crust, probably not 5 stars, but I'd feel like such a hater.  Gourmet toppings on a pizza that's enough to feed 1-2 people for less than $10?  Yeah, see what I mean?"}
{"text":"Zablong is great, a different pizza experience with really great topping choices. If I were you, I would build my own since there aren't currently any additional costs for those..Only downside is theres no size options, you have to get a whole rectangle but that's not really something to complain about since you great a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Awesome little pizza place. Love that you can choose your toppings & they make it right in front of you. Only took a few minutes. And to top it off the pizza was super yummy."}
{"text":"LOVE personal made to order pizzas. First tried this concept in DC and was thrilled when I got back home to Charlotte and realized we had one! It's kind of tucked away in small part of Uptown called the French Quarter.   They have so many fresh and unique ingredients that you can customize your pizza anyway you want from the dough to the sauce to what you put on top. It cooks in just a few minutes and is the perfect portion size.  Charlotte doesn't really have many good pizza options, but I'd put this right at the top!"}
{"text":"Came here after a baseball game. Really good pizza with lots of choices for toppings. Especially liked that they had such a wide variety of veggies for toppings. Also it didn't take too long for the pizza to get ready either. Nice sitting area out in the alley/patio. Definitely would get pizza there again if I'm ever in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally be able to try Zablong when I had to go into the office one day.  The concept is similar to Uncle Maddio's, but that is where the similarities end.  Zablong has lots of available bases, like the traditional tomato, as well as pesto, mushroom truffle, and several others.  Their topping choices are also vast, like the less customary pork belly, shrimp, and ghost pepper salami.  Their pizzas are long and rectangular, and they appear bigger than the standard personal sized pizza.  I had enough leftover for my husband and I to each have several slices another night.    You can either choose a preset pizza, or choose an unlimited number of toppings for just a few pennies more than $10 (including tax).  I chose the latter option, with a mushroom truffle base, and spinach, roasted red peppers, artichokes, pork belly, arugula, and a red pepper oil.  While you wait your turn to pay, your pizza is baked.  This is a very efficient process, and your pizza will be ready by the time you make it to the register.  I promise, the wait isn't more than 10 minutes from start to finish.  The most important thing is the taste.  Zablong's pizza is fantastic.  I brought several coworkers with me, and we all loved their pies.    Service is friendly here, and I'll definitely return.  What a great addition to Latta Arcade!"}
{"text":"Was excellent, toppings were fresh, crust was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Overall great experience.  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Incredible experience. Friendly pizza staff and the pizza is great for the price! I chose the Build Your Own option and yum!!! My husband got the meathead. Cooked just right and huge portions! You will leave full! Great atmosphere and a great philosophy. Blaze was my favorite create your own pizza place but this place has jumped up to #1 in my books!"}
{"text":"Where do I start??? My boyfriend LOVESS PIZZA! He has been wanting to take me here everytime I'm in town, he finally got the chance to.  I got the Garlic Puree as my base and when I tell you that was the best pizza ever. Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's a fun environment with very friendly and welcoming people. You can literally pick any topping and it never changes the price. The quality of the ingredients are really good.  The pizza is big enough to split between 2 people...4 slices each, and you can even do half & half!  Come in and visit Tas behind the pizza bar! He will make your experience fun!"}
{"text":"Zablong is a wonderful pizza concept that comes in clutch any night of the week that you don't want to cook (or have weekend 2am pizza cravings). Sure it's not a traditional style of pizza (it's oblong) but I promise you, it's delicious. For $10 you can choose from their pre-selected pizza choices, or you can go down the line and grab your own array of toppings. There is a pizza for everyone at this spot!   I also can't recommend the mushroom truffle spread enough, it's not overpowering and just adds a nice mushroom flavor throughout your pizza!"}
{"text":"Chef Tas makes a damn good pizza. $9.29 build your own. So delicious I could cry. It's a rather large pizza also so you could split it. So many options including dairy free and gluten free. Love love love it."}
{"text":"Just had some vegan pizza and it was delicious. I will most definitely come back"}
{"text":"I discover this place about week ago and have been back twice already.  They have great good and a nice place to set outside."}
{"text":"One-of-a-Kind & friendly focused Service!  Ambiance/Surroundings: Located in the French Quarter, downtown Charlotte.   Several parking options, in and outdoor restaurant seating, as well located across from Romare Bearden Park. Get your pizza and cross the street with the kids for grassy picnic, lattice covered tables, bench seating and a granite-scaped water fall.   Pizza: It's unmistakbly Oblonged shape is easily identified but the speciality tastes will be what you remember!  With many options for an eclectic pizza connoisseur, this pizza is perfect to share for only $10.00.  Build your own dough, sauce, cheese and toppings for a unique to you taste!  Great local-to-Charlotte unique pizza place you won't regret visiting, and you'll be back!"}
{"text":"First off, I love where this place is located.  It is a nice little alley way of bars and food!  This is a pizza place where you pick out your dough, your toppings and finishes.  What impressed me most is the more upscale ingredients I have not seen at other locations.  They had roasted cauliflower, goat cheese, and red pepper oil to name just a few.  I love meat, and they also have a great selection of meats.  However, for my chosen pizza on this night, I made a vegetarian pizza that was packed full of flavor.    Seating is a little tight, and if you have kids, you may want to consider splitting a pizza instead of buying their own (unless you are planning to take home some left overs).  This is definitely a place I will make my way to again any time I am in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Build your own pizza joint.  Good quality toppings, and overall good pizza.  I asked them to cook it well done, but it was still a bit soggy.  My wife got a more simple BBQ pizza and it came out great.  The owner (tall guy I fedora who looked like he was in charge) appeared to be a bit pissy, but the rest of the staff was in a good mood.  5 stars if the cooked it all the way and if the owner was a bit friendlier."}
{"text":"Didn't eat there but my coworkers did.  I was jealous.  The problem said looked great and my coworkers loved it."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Charlotte. There are an endless amount of places to grab a slice of pizza here in Charlotte but Zablong takes the cake for me. Located in the neat section of downtown called the French quarter so there is plenty going on aside from pizza.   The greatest thing about Zablong is the ingredients. There are so much to choose from and you can have whatever you want without a limit. There is a single price for the pizza and you just rattle off whatever is on your mind that you want on a pizza. Where else can you do this without worries of them charging by the topping? They've got your basic gourmet toppings plus a lot of others like shrimp, pork belly bacon, and for some reason pineapple??   Make sure to try a different base sauce as they have lots of different options to choose from there. After your pizza runs through the oven make sure to add some extra fancy toppings at the end to really give your pizza a pizazz. Customer service is always on point and they know what they are doing and can help you with any questions. If you need help grab a menu at the door to walk you through the steps and even see some of their pizza creation you might want to try."}
{"text":"What a win for sure. I still can't get over that you can get whatever you want on your pizza and it's still 9.29 no matter what. Watch out mellow mushroom!!!   My hubby built his own ridiculous stacked cheese and meat and I got one of their signature pizzas for 20 bucks. Plus the owner was super friendly in telling us all about their ingredients and how they make everything in house. Take a minute to watch the video they've provided then get in your car and go. I'm already planning our next trip. Wish it was warmer so we could have walked out pizza to the park across the street!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It is tucked back in an alleyway downtown. The oblong pizza style is unique. Being from central Iowa, I was a little confused by the ingredients on the Farmhand, but I rolled with it. I customized it a lot. They did not skimp on the toppings at all. It was fantastic. I didn't think I'd eat it all when I saw how big it was, but I licked my plate clean.   The service was awesome and ridiculously friendly. It was a Thursday night and the team was rocking out. I don't think you can walk in there with a bad attitude and leave with it.   I'm definitely going back on my next trip to the Queen City."}
{"text":"Easily the hippest place on the block!  Rap music playing from the speakers.  Lively graffiti decorating the wall as patrons are greeted with an easy \"what's up?\" from the gorgeous, model type girl making  pizza.  You feel like you are in NYC chilling with the coolest \"in\" crowd around!   While there is an urban vibe to the place, don't expect NYC style pizza, or Chicago deep dish style. This place makes custom flatbread pizza.     It's like a sub shop, but for pizza!  You pick your sauce, protein and veggie toppings, then you watch it take a slow magical ride through the pizza \"conveyer\" belt-type oven.  They have fun names for some of the sauces and toppings.  The garlic sauce is called \"Vampire Slayer.\"  The spicy sauce is \"Angry Tomato\" and so on.  Once your \"Za,\" is baked, on the other side it's boxed and additional toppings of your choice are added for maximum delight!   For a pizza with spinach, mushrooms, red onions, green pepper, sun-dried tomatoes and chicken on it, I paid just over $10.  The pizza was rather small, but could easily feed two adults. I wandered into this place by chance.  I left feeling like I had a unique experience."}
{"text":"This place is fast , friendly , clean , and had delicious pizza . Lots of choices from signature styles or you could build your own . I got the farm hand and was not disappointed . It's an oval thin crust pizza that's cut into 8 slices . Crust was perfectly cooked ! I'd recommend this place , and will return ."}
{"text":"Really yummy Pizza that is created in front of you a'la subway style toppings choosing and a few yet pizzas with names like Vampire Slayer. That's what I got today for lunch! It had salami, garlic, cheese, basil, garlic sauce and topping. So good! Way too much pizza for this chick for lunch. It came home for dinner too. ;) Will be trying again soon."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte, hands down. Folks, there's a reason this place has so many good reviews. We ate here before going to the Knights game (BB&T Ballpark is a block away).   The make your own pizza is the way to go and the prices are great, a whole pizza and a drink is around $11. Plenty of fresh toppings, sauces and cheeses. Friendly staff and ownership. I will comeback here again for sure!"}
{"text":"First off, the service was great. The staff was very helpful with us first timers. Next, the outdoor seating worked perfectly and the eclectic mix of establishments added to the experience. Being off of the Busy street made the atmosphere relaxing. Finally but most importantly, the pizza was fantastic. My wife and I shared a Southern Comfort and it was great. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is great. I have come numerous times for lunch, dinner, and for a late night snack. I typically stick with a simple cheese pizza; however my friends typically go with something more elaborate and we all agree it tastes great. I like how you can very easily make your own pizza and the people who work there now know me and my order (and my allergies). The staff is extremely welcoming and definitely make my day when I visit. The shape of the pizza definitely mixes it up and is a great addition to make it unique. You always know when people have Zablong pizza because of the box. I highly advise everyone to stop by here for a quick lunch or a late night snack on weekends."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza spots in Uptown Charlotte.  When they first opened, I was a bit skeptical of the whole idea of peculiar pizza, but now I am a follower and believer.   Zablong is a custom - build your own pizza joint.   There are several suggestions they have on the right side of the wall, but you can put whatever you want on it.  Go hog wild and make a super meat pizza, or as spicy a hell pizza, or even as gluten free and vegan as you can make it pizza.  My suggestion is to don't over do it to much with the toppings and sauces.  Also, take the pizza to the park and enjoy the nice scenery. It'll be very relaxing and improve your outlook on life for the rest of the day.   DO PIZZA IN THE PARK!"}
{"text":"According to one source that listed the best pizza joints in America, Zablong is the best pizza in all of Charlotte. Well, I'm not going to argue. This is some great pizza.  Dough pressed and laid out, then the pizza is assembled in front of you. Unlimited toppings and yes, they mean unlimited. The pizza is oval shaped, similar to the sort of pizza that I enjoyed in Rome. It's a thin crust. And it's quite tasty.  I opted for the \"Angry Sauce\" and topped it with cheese, mushrooms, red onions, red peppers and grilled chicken. The pizza wasn't five minutes in the oven and then it was boxed and ready. A great deal for $10. More than enough for one. Almost enough for two.  They have a couple of bottled beers in the cooler and a Coke Freestyle machine.  Zablong is located in the Latta Arcade, closer to Romare Bearden Park."}
{"text":"Now let me tell you!!! This place is bomb!!! From the fresh ingredients, the quick service and the taste of the pizza. It's kinda tucked back in a little alleyway with other shops around it so you definitely have to be looking for it. Wish I would have taken pics of the inside. Very cool. Anyway, the pizza is rectangular shaped and you choose what you want on it from the sauce to the toppings and it ready in about 5-7 minutes. Delicious!!! Will definitely be going here again! Oh and the pizza was like 11.00 but worth..::I actually had two meals off it."}
{"text":"My fiance suggested trying Zablong last weekend and I was like, \"What's that?\" Clearly, I've been living under a rock because this place is awesome! It's like the subway of pizza - you go in, pick your dough, add your toppings, wait 2-3 minutes for it to be cooked, and voila!   I ordered the Tree Hugger on whole wheat dough. I comes with Oregano Oil, Fresh Mozzarella, Caramelized Onions, Arugula, Cherry Tomatoes, Red Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Fresh Shaved Asiago Cheese. All the ingredients seemed fresh, and I loved the dough. It creates a thin crust that is still pretty soft. My pizza took just a few minutes to cook and it was so good. This place is great if you're in a time crunch but still want something somewhat healthy and not \"fast food.\"   The only challenge is parking at Latta Arcade (and uptown in general). Luckily, John and I had taken the trolley uptown and were walking around. This is great is you're in the area and need to get lunch or dinner somewhere."}
{"text":"We stopped by for quick lunch yesterday and were not disappointed with Zablong's style. My favorite part, all pizzas are $9 and some change, and everything is customizable! The line moves quickly so don't be discouraged during the lunch rush. Everyone is super nice and even had energy to crack jokes during the lunch rush, much appreciated. I like to use their special pizzas, like the Vampire Slayer, as a base and add as needed. I thought the spicy chickpeas and red chili oil were unique and delicious. The ricotta spread gave awesome flavor, I wish all pizzas had a ricotta spread! The crust was nothing short of perfection, more flatbread/thin crust like. All in all wonderful pizza and very flavorful, beat out Brixx in that aspect.   I do suggest cutting the cherry tomatoes into quarters instead of halves. Just would make things easier. We'll be back for sure, cheers!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is good for a very good price. The signature recipes are the bomb. I'm a Southern Comfort fan. I love that they close at 3 am on Fridays and Saturdays so you can go for a midnight pizza run. And I also love that they play hip hop and just have a dope vibe. It's Charlotte's best kept secret for now. You can create your own pizza or try their signature recipes. Unlimited toppings!!!!"}
{"text":"What a unique dining experience. I've never been to a pizza bar where you can add your toppings like you can make a Subway sandwich. They have one set rate for every and every sauce, cheese, topping, and dough. The only thing extra is $1 for gluten free dough. You can get every single topping and it will cost the same as a cheese pizza. Amazing.  Their toppings are fresh, the dough is fresh, and the decor? Yes. It's fresh.  Will I come back? Of course. There's plenty of restaurants in the area, but I will always choose Zablong. And then I will walk to Amelie's for dessert."}
{"text":"Where to start?!   Zablong is awesome. It's a build your own pizza joint with endless options. You have choices on crust (gluten free available!), sauces and plenty of toppings--after the pizza goes through the oven you have options for addition add-ons and oils to finish it off. Did I mention you can pick as many as you want for the same price?  The pizza is $11, big enough to share with a friend and you can load it up as much as you want, it comes served in a to-go-box so you can sit and enjoy or take it home.   I recommend the fig marsala add-on--it's great. There are so many options, think out of the box!   In addition to the awesome food and amazing price, the customer service is incredible."}
{"text":"Zablong is tucked away in the French Quarter and when we visited late night, I expected it to be Subway quality in terms of ingredients.  Fortunately, it was really good!    You start off by picking a crust and sauce, and then from there, you are off and running piling on unlimited ingredients.  We got chicken, pepperoni, 4 cheese, part cheese, etc, etc, etc.  Then they cook your pizza in about 2 minutes.  The pizza was delicious, too.  It wasn't overly greasy and it had a lot of flavor.  (I recommend the red pepper oil)  It's not NY pizza, but it is great flatbread pizza.  I look forward to going back and piling on some new ingredients in the future."}
{"text":"Not one complaint. Unique create your own pizza. Ive had Blaze in vegas but Zablong's pie is much tastier. Very friendly service. We ordered a pie for $9 and split it into \"the Vampire\" and the \"Tree Hugger.\" The vampire had  ricotta, basil, oil and four cheeses. SO good but even tastier was the tree hugger with the arugula, carmelized onions, kalamata olives, mozzarella,balsamic, cherry tomatoes and more. Awesome place and people!"}
{"text":"An awesome pizza place that Charlotte needed badly. Amazing taste and reasonably price. Reminds me of &Pizza in DC which used to be my favorite until now.  This is also my favorite downtown quick lunch spot.  Nice to have an different from the rest pizza joint in Charlotte finally."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and enjoyed it both times. There are great combinations for everyone. On our last visit we ordered the double pepperoni and the vampire slayer. I thoroughly enjoyed the pepperoni but didn't care much for the vampire slayer. Not because it was a bad pizza, but it just wasn't for me.  They have indoor and outdoor seating so no matter how large your party is you'll be able to find a seat. I really like the atmosphere on the inside with the art and decorations. It's a great casual place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place in Charlotte! For $10 you can custom-design any pizza your heart desires. Seriously, unlimited toppings...I couldn't believe it!  (Deep breath)  Okay, so I started with the Southern Comfort signature pizza from their menu. It came with southern cream, garlic purée, mozzarella cheese, sweet corn, pork belly bacon, and basil. I chose it mostly because of the garlic and the corn (which I had never seen on pizza).  I was asked if I wanted any additional toppings, so I added delicious-looking caramelized onions. I figured only the basic toppings were free, but when she asked me if I wanted any more, I threw a Hail Mary and requested shrimp. The woman behind the counter not only obliged, but she seemed genuinely delighted to be loading my pizza with more toppings.  I became a little embarrassed to be adding so much, so I told her to go ahead and stick it in the oven. As my pizza started its slow journey, I spotted some tantalizing meatballs. I must've been drooling or something because the woman noticed and asked if I wanted some. Of course I did! In a flash, she grabbed them, broke them up, and sprinkled the meat onto my pizza just before it disappeared out of sight.  Sure enough, on the other side of the oven were even more yummy toppings begging for me to pile them on. Before I even realized what I was doing, my pizza was full of kalamata olives, pineapple, and parmesan cheese. I was finally done!  My finished product probably looked like Frankenstein's monster to a pizza purist, but it tasted freaking amazing. I guess if I had planned ahead better, I would have omitted the pineapple, as it tasted a little out of place with the other ingredients. Anyway, it was not a terrible problem to have, and my solution was to simply start picking them off and eating them separately.  The pizza is very large for the price, and with all the fresh toppings to choose from, you're getting incredible value....This was basically all I ate for the whole day. If you're still hungry afterward, then you only have your lack of imagination to blame!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza I've had in Charlotte. Love that you can add pretty much whatever you want for a flat price. The pizza is perfect for splitting or saving half for dinner/tomorrow's lunch. Their teas are really good as well."}
{"text":"The pizza was so delicious I went back twice in three days. I will be returning, and I highly recommend the tipsy goat add chicken"}
{"text":"While having a quick meeting in French Quarter, a friend of mine got hungry and so we walked over to Zablong (now Peculiar Pizza). The inside was very colorful, graffiti on the walls and various colored stools to go with the long family style tables. The atmosphere on a free night is fun lighthearted and very very diverse for this little pocket of bars - which I was pleasantly surprised! The service is fast and the food only took minutes to prepare! The waitstaff was respectful but worked quickly as the line on a Friday night at around 12am was getting long. Here, unlike places like Blaze pizza (which I also love) you can puts all the toppings your heart desires from shrimp to artichoke to prosciutto! It was crazy to me I knew never knew this place existed. The friend I was with preferred the following - garlic and classic tomato sauce mixed together, cheese, spinach, shrimp, pork, peppers, artichoke, and a drizzle of ranch. How he invented this I have no idea but when the taste was amazing! The sauce was INCREDIBLE - the garlic packs a nice zesty punch! The shrimp was nicely seasoned as well as the pork- creating their own pockets of flavor. The artichoke, peppers, and ranch added textured crunch and even more flavor to the dish which the spinach also played well into. My piece from the pie took me on a rollercoaster of goodness! And for those watching their waistlines, the pizza is basically a flatbread and they have a wheat option."}
