{"text":"Pizza was just bad plus the dough was not cooked all the way and it took along time for delivery and I only live a few mins away. I want to give this place a second chance since it's so close and I see other positive reviews. But my first time eating there was just awful"}
{"text":"Horrible service they say they are open then dont answer the phone screw this piece of crap place none of us will even order from here again. Pizza isnt even that good. Have fun with your shop that will be out of business in 5 years anyway"}
{"text":"Delicious!! We have tried pizza everywhere... and LOVED Cliffside!! I would highly recommend it to anyone:)"}
{"text":"Order ONLINE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!  First and last time I will ever order from them. I ordered online at 409pm. 520pm rolls around, no pizza. I call and the guy asks for my phone # then says the driver left with it and he will call to see what's up. 20 more minutes pass, now it's been 1.5 hrs so I call again. The guy asked for my address and says he doesn't have an order for me. I said, \"you asked me for my # 20 min ago when I called and you said the guy was out with it\" Then he says, \"I don't know WTF is going on\". He proceeds to say \"F*&k\" about 5 more times. He calls someone and explains what is going on with my situation and argues with someone. Then he gets back to me and says he can make my food and have it delivered soon. After his unprofessional \"F BOMBS\" I declined. Not a good way to run a business. Hell, at least offer me a free pizza or something for all the trouble. But nope, nothing, just \"What the f*^k\", \"F*&k\", \"This is f*&king ridiculous\". HIGHLY ENCOURAGE NOT ORDERING FROM THEM UNTIL THEY GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER!!"}
{"text":"Most definitely, Cliffside has the best Antipasto salad in Etna...if not all of Pittsburgh! If you go there for anything, you must give this salad a try. It's loaded with meats and cheeses and has an amazing homemade dressing that just ties it all so wonderfully together. Seriously, the dressing is so good I'd take a shot of it! Also, if you're into the hot stuff, give the Hot Ranch or Hot Garlic wings a try. Da bomb, just saying. I've had both their white and red sauce pizza. The red pepperoni knocked my socks off. It's a cool little place, jutted up right against a cliff, and there's a wonderful yard for eatin' and chillin'. Try this great place out!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Luca's and I was disappointed. Not sure if we got a bad batch of sauce or dough but it was waaaay too salty. Hard to eat. Plus it wasn't even hot at all. Barely warm... I also got hot wings which were not spicy at all and soggy (breaded wings). I asked for diet Pepsi and got regular."}
{"text":"We stopped in after a visit to the Pittsburgh Zoo; our GPS listed it as an ice cream shop, but pizza is good too!  And the pizza was indeed good; we shared a pie and a bottle of Coke.  The pizza was hot out of the oven with nice fresh toppings.  The staff were friendly and the store was cozy (obviously take-out is a bigger business for them than eat-in, but they had a couple of tables), and the building really is right up against a cliff on the mountain, though you could really say the same about pretty much everything in the Pittsburgh-Johnstown area."}
{"text":"This is place is spot on and has quick delivery. It's your normal everyday pizza , it's cheap and quick and consistent .. I live nearby and I've never had a problem getting anyone on the phone when I call and it's been 8 or more times, disgruntled employees , perhaps made those other reviews .."}
{"text":"It is impossible to get them to answer the phone during regular posted business hours.  I called twice last week during their advertised business hours on their menu and there was no answer.  It rolled to voicemail but you cannot leave a message.  That's OK, there are no less than 10 different pizza places that deliver to my house in Millvale.  I recommend calling one of these guys since they actually answer the phone.  La Nova Pizzeria, Vocelli's, Lupi's Famous Pizza, Large Plain, Pesaro's Pizza, Frank's Pizza and Chicken, Supreme Pizza, Calabria's, Pizza Riviera, and Milano.  If you can however get Cliffside to answer their phone, I like the meatball hoagie and their cliffside fries.  Oh well, another pizza place bites the dust.  I will never order from them again."}
