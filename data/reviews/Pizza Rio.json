{"text":"Don't order from Pizza Rio in Canonsburg! Terrible customer service! We ordered our food and were told the wait was 1 hr. That's ok, we understand they were busy. When they showed up an hour and 10 mins later, they only delivered half our order. When we called back, we were told we had to wait another 50 mins for the rest of our food (and we only live 2 mins away). That's ridiculous in and of itself, but then they never showed up at all. My husband had to go to the shop himself just to get our money back. I can't speak to the food itself, since I never got to eat it."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in SW PA. 

Ordered and paid on line, however it took two people to confirm payment when I arrived to pick up my order, which, by the way wasn't even in the oven when I arrived at the designated ready time. Maybe the issue with payment and time confirmation needs to be ironed out with the ordering app they use, Yelp Eat24. Also, why ask for payment for a meal that hasn't been served? Over heard them making apologies over the phone for other order errors. 

With a bit of system correction, customer service training and some good old southern hospitality this place has a chance. I hope they read this and take it as constructive criticism. I want them to succeed. The pizza is that good.

Update: Still good, better service timing. Try it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Canonsburg easily. Their pepperoni rolls are awesome as well. Make sure to ask for extra ranch, which is real good, to dip your pizza in."}
{"text":"We love ordering delivery from here.  We have tried every take out option in a twenty mile radius, and I am confident in saying that this is, by far, the absolute best.  The crust is perfect, the sauce is spot on and the roasted garlic topping they offer is AMAZING.  The salads are the freshest I've ever gotten from a pizzeria, and they have never hesitated to meet my vegetarian needs whilst also satisfying my husband's carnivore cravings.  This place is the best kept secret in Canonsburg and should be everyone's \"go-to\" choice for takeout or delivery."}
{"text":"We tested five different pizzas and they were all pretty good. Personally I don't like the crust so much. The ranch dressing is awesome. I asked if the seafood pizza has real crab meat and they said yes, but it has the artificial crab."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but the service is notI asked for extra of the ranch sauce it comes with and I didn't get any at all. Disappointing overall, especially recently"}
{"text":"pizza is ok, nothing to get to worked up over. what i really dig from here are the gyros. not as good as mr gyros but they deliver to my crib so score a yum yum. open late and online ordering is nice..try it."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good and the cheese sticks are amazing! The guys there are all really nice and helpful. I'm really picky about the pizza I eat, and this place has some of my favorite pizza. I would definitely recommend Pizza Rio to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online to hotel. Got Italian stromboli, garden salad,  cheesecake, and a soda. Salad was fresh and the house ranch dressing is as good as other reviews say. Stromboli was big and tasted great. The marinara on the side made it better.  Cheesecake was good too. I'm glad I ordered from here. If I ever come through town again, I'll be ordering.  Oh and the delivery driver was nice, too!"}
{"text":"Loved the general tso's and blazin chicken pizzas! So flavorful and tasty. It was our first time ordering from here so we definitely will again!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around... hands-down! Other menu items are good ( wings, hoagies, etc...) its the pizza that stands out. Recommend the margherita or veggie supreme pizzas highly. If in the mood for just a plane jane cheese pizza that is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Not very pleased! No IBC root beer like on the menu, then they forgot to send the replacement drinks. I will say however the very nice delivery man tried to make it up to us by giving all of the drinks he had in his car to us but they were very warm."}
{"text":"Just ordered the RIO Pie from Pizza Rio in Canonsburg, I Thought the price was kind of high, but decided to give it a shot. Was told that it would be a 45 minute wait, but the Driver showed up in 20. Very polite and early, how often does that happen...? The Pizza was Excellent, I am looking forward to my next Pizza Rio Experience, THANKS ....."}
{"text":"Save your money & time! This place is a joke that does not care about their customers. If you are looking for a good sub do not go here. I ordered a ham & cheese and got some sliced cooked ham leftover crap w soggy tomatoes brown lettuce and no mayo!! Such a waste of money! This is not our first bad experience but it will be our LAST! If you complain they do not care!"}
{"text":"Great! Probably the best Pizza in the Canonsburg Area, sizes and portions bigger than most places around, extensive menu, the sauce stood out the most it was sweet yet spiced accordingly to quality pizza standards, cheese is hefty and compliments the sauce well, our new favorite spot! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I had called in my order at 12:20.  It is 2 PM.  My order is not here and my card was charged.  I called the  place once and they told me my Pizza should be here in 5 mins.   20 mins later I call and they say the driver is coming down my drive.  20 mins later no driver.  I can't even determine how the pizza will be.   I may retract my review if it arrives at all and is decent...as well...they fix this.  I've never experienced anything like this before."}
{"text":"First time trying Pizza Rio was a good experience. Ordering on Yelp made it easy and fast. Customer service was on point and delivery time was pretty darn close! We had the Hawaiian and the Olympus. Hawaiian was good, loved the sauce. Olympus was surprisingly good as well. Great flavor, fresh ingredients. Will def order again."}
{"text":"Shame there isn't less than a one star option because this place deserves it more than any other take out place I have ever called. When I first call they tell me they are out of cheese and can't make pizzas, which was perfect because I wanted wings. When I ask for wings he replies with oh well yeah we don't have wings either and we are kinda closed now.. Depressing because the only bad reviews on here are customer service problems and 9 times out of 10 I disregard those because some reviewers are crazy but this place backs up their shitty reviews. Shame on you rio.. shame on you"}
{"text":"Normally, this is my favorite pizza place, hands down. I order from there weekly, at least. Today was my last. I just had the worst interaction I think I've ever had with any employee anywhere. I ordered by phone and was quoted a price. It's always the same price because I mostly order the same exact thing. So, when I go to pick it up, a different guy, who looked stoned out of his mind, quotes me a different price.  I corrected him and cops SERIOUS attitude. The girl at the counter even leaned over and corrected him. He gets mad slams the drawer and throws my receipt at me. So, I told him that usually when employees are wrong, instead of getting shitty, they apologize. This is where he gets tough guy and tries to stare me down. I promptly reminded him and her in a loud voice how much I do business there and maybe he should keep that in mind when treating repeat customers. Long story made short, asshole caused them to lose my sizable business."}
{"text":"I was staying in a hotel so pizza delivery was my best option.  Ordered a medium pizza and soft drink.  The drink bottle was cold and the pizza hot and delicious.  Good the next day as leftovers too.  What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"2nd seafood pizza added bacon was absolutely worth it. Staff super friendly... Definitely going to try something new next time."}
{"text":"Great chicken wings! I also ordered cheese pizza,that was good . Order came on time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Canonsburg.  Great tasting food, fast delivery and delivery drivers are very friendly! Everything I've ordered has been correct and delicious!"}
{"text":"It took 2 hours to deliver food and i when i called after an hour they said they didn't have the order and then someone appeared an hour later.  They were missing my drink. The alfredo pasta was disgusting, no flavor, odd melted cheese on top, burned around edges. Calzone was overcooked, fries with cheese were gross. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Ordered there with a couple of my friends... Great pastas great salads great everything! It's definitely my new go to!"}
{"text":"Ordered a small pizza, hoagie & side salad using their online service at 11:30. 12:45 rolls around - nothing. I called the store to get a status and was told \"we're just finishing it up now\" without confirming my name/address/anything. Okay.......... So what was quoted 45-60 minutes  turned into almost double that. Absolutely ridiculous even on a Saturday. Food FINALLY shows up at 1:00.

Salad was very.. Pepper-y. And no cheese? Ranch was good though. Probably won't order again. 

Steak hoagie was hot and delicious. Lots of meat. Would definitely order that again.

Pizza was average. I've had better and worse. The sauce was good though. They give you a side of ranch with it. I don't dip my pizza in ranch, but for people that are into that kind of thing I guess it's an added bonus. I used it to offset the weird taste in my salad.

Overall, the portions were definitely worth the price. The delivery is a big turn off if you're hungry though. Definitely don't believe their estimate. I would order from again if I was in the mood for a hoagie or having a lot of people over."}
{"text":"They make some great pies.  We get pizza here often - I really like the sauce and the sauce to cheese ratio.  What gives this place five stars though is the ranch.  My god, is that ranch sauce delicious.  We always order extra.  It has like a garlic-like taste to it.  Very, very good for dipping the crust!  The wings are ok, but I've had better wings elsewhere.  If I could give them one tip, I'd say to make sure they are checking the online orders.  We ordered online a few times and they didn't have the pizzas made when we arrived to pick them up."}
{"text":"Best hoagies and homemade ranch in the area. Hoagies are HUGE. 18 inches! Great bread with meat stacked and fresh produce. Have tried the fish, steak, club supreme, and italian hoagies. All have been very good. Pasta meals were above par as well.  You wouldn't think of great desserts at a pizza shop but their peanut butter pie is awesome! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"So first the food is good and it does take forever to get delivered but today what happened was just not acceptable to me.  Ordered two pasta dishes and waited are normal hour for delivery.  The one dish was Carbonara with no mushrooms but add Broccoli.  Once we get it open and the broccoli isn't on the pasta and one mushroom was in it.  Call the store and talk to manager who said he would remake it and I let him know I just wanted the steamed broccoli for it don't need it remade.  He says he will get that out.  So we eat the salad and wait to eat the pasta. now 45 min later I call back.  The first person I speak to doesn't know what I'm talking about but says they are out of broccoli.  Get the manager who then says that they are out of it but they were busy and he didn't have my number handy.  Next order though he will discount it.  I told him don't bother.  He did even say he would go to the store and get some.  The problem with that is I don't want this process to eat our dinner to take 4 hours.  So I have had a lot of good experiences here but this one has ruined it.  If you are willing to wait the hour and don't have a special order or have anything wrong with your order you should be fine."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for delivery to my hotel room as I was stuck working.  I got the Gyro Pie and it was amazing. So fresh and the crust was perfect - not too thick and not too thin. I got an extra side of ranch with my side salad (also fresh!!) to go with the pizza and I should have ordered a gallon of it. It was some of the best ranch I've ever had.  Delivery was faster than expected and will definitely hit this place up again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I ordered the Buffalo chicken salad and wedding soup for delivery to my hotel. It arrived quickly and the food was really good.  The portions were pretty big and I could not finish everything.  I recommend this place and would order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a Sunday when I heard there was a new pizza place in town. Just what we we're missing with three of them now in a row right down on main street, eh?
It's not often a pizza place has soup, but the lobster bisque was actually quite good! We ordered a super steak sandwich which was also top notch. 
There was also a small specialty pizza (Hawaiian-style), but I did not have any of it. The wife said it was just okay, but tasted better the second day. She was hoping it had a thinner crust, like in the picture. 

I'll be anxious to try the other soups and sandwiches based on the experience so far.

*edit: There are not 3 pizza places on the strip. Pizza Rio took the place of 3 Guyz."}
{"text":"I recommend saving your money. Grandes, Pizza Hut, Jimmy Zs or Sams. Please save your money!! Some food is decent and most is disgusting. My father quite enjoys this place an I have no idea how! Never have gotten my order correct, ranch became blue cheese, nothing but croutons on my salad had everything but croutons, expect more tomato chunks than actual pasta, also check the prices when you pay they have tried to overcharge 2x before. Disappointed because such a good location."}
{"text":"Ordered my food at 10:15pm. It's now 11:30pm and the food is still not here. I called yelp support and the restaurant was closed so they could not even give me an update. Horrible horrible service!!! I canceled the order and got a refund. Thanks for nothing pizza rio!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they take forever and a day for delivery. In the past we ordered it at work, but when it takes over 2hrs for a salad it isn't worth it.

Now if I'm at home, I wouldn't mind picking it up, hopefully it would be faster."}
