{"text":"Not really authentic Hakka food, maybe more Indian Hakka food. The Chef's Special Fried Rice is a little burned and the look of it is not very appealing. The service is good tho. But probably won't come back, there are lots more good food out there, it is just so-so food."}
{"text":"A relatively quiet restaurant considering I had dinner here on the weekend.  Most people were picking up their take out orders and just one other table had diners.  The special combo menu had variety and a good value."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of hakka places like federicks, Lin garden, hakka work, etc... And this place stands out due to the food and value.  The pakoras here are excellent.  They are crispy, not oily at all, and full of flavour.  Portion size is also huge.  Chili chicken is also good compared to other hakka places.

I usually get takeout and it seems like the choice for most people as this place is normally pretty empty in terms of dine in customers.  You also get 10% off on orders over $30 if you pay cash."}
{"text":"Hakka Indian Chinese with a better flavor
There are umpteen Hakka Indian restaurants in the GTA. However, this outlet definitely offers better taste than most. Envoirnment is very simple and clean.
Service was great; food was even better.
Amount of food served for a lunch special at a very reasonable price is incredible.
I would prefer this restaurant above many other Hakka Indian restaurants,if it was any closer to where I stay.
A must for anyone living in the area."}
{"text":"These guys make some solid dishes at a decent price too ! The restaurant is unfortunately empty but I always get take-out so its hard to explain the vibe. Been going here for years as I grew up. I'd rather order from here than Tangerine."}
{"text":"love this place. I just moved into this area recently and I am glad I found this place to grab a quick take out and maybe have a quick drink while I wait. I will be telling my friends about this place. Very quiet place where you can sit and have some good food."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here last night after work. We weren't sure where to go as it was already 930pm by the time he was off work. I found this place on yelp.. wasn't sure what to expect as there was only 3  reviews and no one inside. The reviews were good and it was open till 11 so we're like what heck ..

The venue inside was nice and clean inside, we were the only ones there. We ordered seven vegetables with cashew, manchurian chicken, and beef chilli fries rice. Water was from the tap (I could hear her pour it) and a can of diet coke. The service is like any other Asian place, you get their attention when you need it. She was quick as she was in the front  but not the type where they come ask you if you're okay every 10 mins.
Food tasted wonderful, we had lots of left overs and the overall price was about 28 before tip. 

The only weird thing was some man came In half way through our meal to order a beer. . Stared at as for a few moments then went to sit down behind us... then 10 mins  later sat at a table beside us and was pretty much staring the whole time until he was done his beer.. that was just a little uncomfortable.. not their fault ..but was still weird lol 

There was lot on the menu we still want to try.. we will  be coming back again !"}
{"text":"This is not a typical hakka restaurant.
Their food is light and easy on the stomach, its also not overly spicy or salty!

They have some options that are very healthy and you can have them without breaking your diet plan!

Diet meal:
Try the cashew chicken, it comes with white rice and the whole dish is just chicken and vegetables with some flavorful curry. It's not oily either. You can skip the rice and just have chicken and vegetables.

A little bit more spicy:
Beef chilli with gravy was a tad more spicy, but it was still very easy on the stomach and very flavorful.

The place seems to be very quite and off the radar. There were some old people sitting and having tea but nobody besides us was having food.

They also have great Chicken Corn Soup!

Would definitely recommend for a light lunch."}
{"text":"if you are from mumbai like me then you will definitely find this place close to what we find in mumbai. Definitely a must go. Also for some reason am really impressed with their clean washrooms."}
{"text":"Nice family run restaurant serving good tasting food with decent sized portions. The d√©cor is a bit outdated but don't let that distract you from a variety of tasty food choices. One of the better hakka joints in the area."}
{"text":"It's a small place for large groups to come and eat. The service is nice and polite usually , but today the service was a bit rude. A few customers came in and say down and the waiter didn't even notice so the customer had to go up and ask for the menu. When ordering food , the waiter questioned us for adding more to the already ordered dish in a rude , mean way. The food can be better , but overall great place."}
{"text":"another mission of looking for good take out in toronto. i used to live in this neighbourhood, way before all these plazas popped up (am i dating myself) and every time i come around here (which is not too often) i always seem to find something of interest. this time it is a dingy little hakka restaurant at the corner of this plaza. 

When I walked in on a week night, the place was dark and empty, save for one table of south asian men. I looked at their menu on the counter and ordered the typical dishes: chili fish, manchurian fried rice, szechuan fried beans, and manchurian chicken. We got a discount for take out. The portions were huge! both my dad and my husband loved the food. i thought they were decent too. i think the total was only $35 - great bang for the buck!

i know my husband will definitely want to eat there again next we are back in town."}
{"text":"Wanlee Loy is a great choice for a single diner like myself.

22 different choice of 1 plate dish for $6.99 with a pop, The selection is good for both spicy and non spicy lovers even for a Hakka restaurant, And of course I ordered mine extra spicy.

Food was cooked to order and my lunch was just hot hot and spicy hot, 

Great portion and friendly service.

Decor a little dated but feels homey."}
{"text":"stumbled upon this local Hakka restaurant while making a grocery run.

Not bad, portions are decent.  I've had better chili chicken but thats not a knock on this place.  Their rice noodle dish is good, usually other asian restaruants just fry the white rice noodles and put a saucey topping with vegetables and meats.  this place actually fried the rice noodles with soy sauce and other ingredients at the bottom..  \"gong chow ngor haw\" at the bottom.  and a sauce and beef on top.  quite different than anywhere else."}
