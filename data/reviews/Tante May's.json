{"text":"I just enjoyed a beef shawarma special $8.50 with crispy fries and coke. I was greeted nicely by the owner, great menu. The sandwich and fries was delicious, nice and hot with all the topping I wanted and some garlic sauce for my fries. They also have a $5.00 student shawarma special. I will definitely be coming back again to try the falafel sandwich."}
{"text":"Very tasty great value.  Brand new place nicely furnished and very clean. The owners are super nice and welcoming :)  And the co-owner she's cute :p"}
{"text":"We had the chicken shawarma plate and the chicken shawarma wrap and they were both DELICIOUS and flavourful!! Generous portions, filled with homemade ingredients - Tante May makes the best hummus and garlic paste every morning, definitely authentic. Loved it, already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"I had the beef shawarma special today.  The shawarma was like heaven in my mouth,  well balanced and just delicious.  Side salad (semi-Greek) also tasty.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 After seeing all the reviews I made a trip to visit this place for lunch. The restaurant looked closed from the outside... it looked super dark, however they were open. The restaurant was empty yet clean and nice! I was immediately greeted by I'm assuming the owners.... elderly man and woman. The man could barely speak English however he was very kind and had a big smile on his face.  On to the food.... I ordered the special which included a chicken shawarma wrap, drink and a side salad. Now I take my shawarma wraps pretty serious... IMO, a good shawarma is composed of seasoned fresh high quality meat, amazing garlic sauce and fresh toppings... if the restaurant makes their own wraps... they get extra points! Now the wrap at Tante May's was good, What made it good? the meat.... the chicken was fresh and extremely well seasoned and high quality. The toppings were okay... the hummus was fine... the garlic sauce... tbh I couldn't even taste it...sadness**... the star of my meal definitely was the side salad and the chicken pieces.   P.S. it took them over 10 mins to make my wrap/salad.... definitely shocked me since I was in an empty restaurant. Will I be back? probably not"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! What a wonderful experience I had at tante May's. The staff were very welcoming and the food was great. My sister and I both had the chicken shawarmas and they were the best shawarmas we've had. Very flavourful and tasty.   I would recommend this place to anyone who is craving some Lebanese deliciousness.   I'll definitely be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Shawarma sandwich here was absolutely delicious!! Well spiced, fresh toppings and not too messy!!   One pitfall was the side salad, it was the same as the inside of the sandwich just with no meat.  If you come here just get the sandwich - worth the trip."}
