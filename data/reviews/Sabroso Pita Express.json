{"text":"My favourite beef shawarma wrap I've ever had! I keep going back. It's very consistent food. Fresh ingredients and flavourful meat. The friendly service only makes the delicious food taste even better."}
{"text":"Food was good for its price, but nothing set it apart from all the other shawarma places. The guy there wasn't too friendly, and was kind of an asshole."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town!!!! Meat is juicy and succulent and very fresh. Veggies are fresh and vibrant. Owner is one of the most friendly guy I have met. Love this place. Try it once you wont go anywhere else"}
{"text":"My first experience was good.  Friendly guy.  Food OK.  Second experience same bald guy with a mustache was rude upon entry.   I was dressed in gym clothing and wore a hat.  Maybe having a bad day.  I didn't argue with him.  I sat down and opened my laptop.  He scowls at me that it's not allowed.  Based on my first experience I thought he was joking.  He wasn't.  The establishment was empty.  I packed up and he mumbled something to the woman and they both sneered at me.  I smiled and they looked away.  Maybe not my day,  but I know this is not customer service.  The food isn't so good I would take the insult of their disservice."}
{"text":"Love their chicken shawarma plate! The owner is very positive and friendly and whenever I request extra tabouli, he always happily provides. I also love their empanadas.  Tip: Try a slice of their carrot cake. One of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly greeted when I walked in. I was very pleased with the customer service. The chicken shawarma plate was great. Chicken is juicy and served with delicious salad rice and big piece of potatoe! I would go Here again"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for your reviews about this place! So glad I found myself wandering around this plaza and decided to check it out. While it may not be completely authentic, it is really, really good and the lady behind the counter is a sweetheart!  Be sure to try their falafels and shawarmas :)"}
