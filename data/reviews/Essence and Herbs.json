{"text":"We had a rehearsal dinner here and were very pleased. The food was excellent, the atmosphere was nice and the service was very good. The owner truly cared about our experience. Everyone had a great time. We even got to meet the chef. Thank you Chanthy!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Service is great. What a team. The team at Essence and Herbs made our experience very enjoyable. Thanks to Daniel, Dj, Laura, Megan and the chefs makes this place. By the way try the crab cakes, jalapeño  bacon scallops and the creme brûlée. We had the ribeye and it was on point!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  I'm being very generous with 3 stars because the manager reduced the bill and the bus boy, Matt, worked his tail off.  They need to promote him to server.  I ordered the dinner for 2, plus a lobster tail.  Pros - The ambiance was nice, the staff courteous.  They worked on the problems with a pleasant attitude.  The Mac and Cheese was great.  The bus boy had a great attitude, especially given there was a party of 8 next to us.  The manager gave us an extra dessert (1 is included with dinner) and coffee to make up for any snafus.  The desserts tasted great! He also reduced the bill as a good manager should for all the things wrong with the meal, without me asking.   Cons - The food came out sporadically meaning the main course came out without the sides until I asked for them. The order was wrong. We asked for Chateaubriand well done, they brought it medium. Not a big deal, usually happens at other steakhouses on occasion.  The frites were very soggy.  The lobster tail a little cold. The dinner rolls were also cold.  They were very understaffed, the server was M.I.A. (Missing in action) and the bus boy did all the work including fixing any mess ups.  I'm writing this in the hopes they can fix some problems and make it a better place. If I'm spending over $120 for dinner for two without alcohol, I expect a flawless dinner. I would comeback if they had more staff.  It has potential.  Tips: make a reservation and build in extra time to find your way around Lake Las Vegas.  Park near the Hilton garage and walk down past the Mexican restaurant on the left once you are in the \"Village\"."}
{"text":"Forget it. The boss was drinking wine with a friend at the bar. They did not really care and the steakhouse was converted into a tapas place..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We sat outside and had a fabulous dinner while listening to the harpist playing beautiful music!! An excellent experience!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant  is located in a nearly deserted shopping district.   Service was terribly slow.  They are transitioning their menu from steaks and seafood to tapas....  We ordered off the old menu.  The Kitchen Sink salad was excellent, with lots of fresh seafood, but the steaks were horribly over-seasoned and over-cooked.    Perhaps the new menu will be better."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Located at Montelago Village in Lake Las Vegas.  Your view is quite spectacular-the restaurant is literally right next to the lake.  The interior is also decorated quite lovely and comfortable.  So, you have this amazing view along with elegant surroundings coupled with great food: inventive dishes, great service, and a very friendly staff.  Have you ever tried poke on a salt slab?  I had a wonderful experience here.  Try it."}
{"text":"What a great Restaurant! Great wine, food, atmosphere and view! We were planning to eat at another restaurant and head live soft music. It overlooks Lake Las Vegas and has a beautiful patio. We had filet, Caesar salad and shrimp cocktail which was amazing. Reasonable prices and great customer service. Relax with wine and watch boats on the lake. Wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Vine con mi esposo porque es mi cumpleaños, y justo cayo jueves de All you can eat ( $20 por persona)  Toda la carta es deliciosa ! Y adicional pedimos unos tostones y un postre ! La atención de Laura fue increíble ! Recomendado 100%"}
{"text":"Laura was our server Saturday night, and let me just tell you, she made our experience there unforgettable. We tried the blue cheese hamburger! It was cooked well done, full of great spices! Thank you! We will probably come back very soon!"}
{"text":"I don't often leave reviews and I especially don't like to leave negative reviews but this time I feel it necessary.  My family and I wound up here on July 3rd after the fireworks celebration.  They were one of the only places open at 920 that still had food.  We went here with the assumption that we were going to have Steak or Seafood as advertised by the huge signage on the building.    After being seated we were handed \"tapas\" and alcoholic drink menus.  Confused we asked our waitress about the menus it was then she explained to us that they were transitioning to a tapas bar and we're not longer a steakhouse.  Being slightly disappointed but starved we made our selections.  Paella, Mac and cheese, the little chicken bites, a side salad and fish and chips.    After about 20 minutes we received the mac and cheese, bland, cold and unimpressive but our little ones were starved so I salt and peppered it up and managed a couple bites in the 2 of them, leaving behind 1 and half bowls uneaten (you know it's bad when kids won't eat it).    While we continued to wait for our other food, we also put in an order for 2 desserts, expressing that we wanted them after of course but wanted to get them ordered since the kitchen was closing in 5 minutes.  We ordered a cheesecake and some dessert that came recommended by the waitress but she said it would take 20 minutes to cook so she put the order in for it right then.    It's now 10pm and still no other food has arrived at the table.  And wouldn't you know, about 10:10pm out comes the cheesecake.  As we sat there with dumb looks on our faces the waitress explained that it's tapas and everything comes out in random orders because certain things take longer to cook than others.  The cheesecake was good.  I'll give them that.  Next up was my salad.  For $9  I was served a bowl of warm  wilted greens, huge chunks of tomatoes, a couple slices of olives and tiny pieces of avocado, the dresser was good but the whole salad was room temperature and for $9 I just could not justify it, back it went.  Again we wait.   Finally about 1030 out comes no food but the 2nd dessert  I kid you not.  2 desserts, but no food.  This time my husband refused the dessert.  And we told them how ridiculius the wait had been and the fact that both desserts had arrived including the one that took 20 minutes to cook but still we waited for food.  After much complaining 3 different people came with excuses as to why our food was taking so long, when we were the only party in the place.  Around 1045, the paella and fish and chips arrived.  The paella was great, the fish and chips, HORRIBLE.  It was a tasteless pile of mush.  The chicken bites arrived last around 1050 and we're as big of a disappointment as the rest, dry, overcooked and unedible.  After complaining politely, the balance of uneaten food was hastily removed from our table and the waitress said she'd bring the check.  When I told her I expected most of the items to be removed she said I'll see what I can do.  Back a few minutes later she said I've taken 15% off your bill.  15% for food that was 75% uneaten?  I refused and asked to speak to the manager.  After much attitude and frustration they removed all of the uneaten items.  This place may have been a 4.5 star steakhouse but as a tapas bar, they are failing miserably, tapas are in essence appetizers,  it should never take and hour and a half to get 5 items.  Not only was the service slow and bad the food was horrible,  unedible.  We literally stopped at in and out on the way home."}
{"text":"Hidden treasure! The staff took care of our large party from beginning to end!!! The food was fabulous!!! Ask Daniel for the lobster mac n cheese!! The Essence dessert is to die for!!! This place is definitely worth the drive!!! @essenceandherbs"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place......awesome food. The Halibut is amazing........The service is exceptional..........going back TONIGHT, 6/27/15.......so excited.  The music, service, food, atmosphere is really perfect.  My favorite here in Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was really good! The truffle mac and cheese was so good and rich. I had the salmon, and my husband had the filet. Both were great! I'd go with the filet next time."}
{"text":"We had our 35 year class reunion here. Awesome food and great service. Great atmosphere! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Extremely awesome service, our server Lloyd was phenomenal!!! Great experience with live music and awesome crowd!  Looking forward to my next vacation!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I are having our rehearsal dinner here this upcoming April. We stopped in for dinner last night to check out the menu and taste a few of their appetizers and entrees. We were completely blown away by the level of service that Chanthy, Miguel, and the rest of the employees provided. The food was fantastic! We sampled about 8 different items on the menu and couldn't choose which one we liked the best. We highly recommend this restaurant for its gorgeous location, amazing food, and top notch service. We can't wait to be back in April to celebrate our rehearsal dinner here!!!"}
{"text":"A new favorite place. Excellent food, fast and friendly service, discussions with Chef Beni... this was an OUTSTANDING (and still affordable) evening! Plantains had a special salt and were very crispy, artichoke tempura.... wow. Mac & cheese had a nice crust and great full flavor. Paella is their specialty and was beyond fantastic and the highlight of the night until we added the garlic pollo - holy cow, definitely belongs on everyone's order!  I seldom review, and only when someone really deserves recognition, and this is one of those times. If you want an off-strip Las Vegas experience at off-strip prices, but on-strip quality and attention, Essence & Herbs belongs on your \"must do\" list."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this wonderful restaurant! The food is exceptional and the service was excellent. I highly recommend the lobster and filet as well as the wedge salad. A perfect special occasion, upscale restaurant. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OMG. I just had the best Chorizo Con Papas, in  a long time. Food good. Wine great. Server was uh mmmmm ok.... Just Kidding John was great. We had the best service in a while. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ate here with kids while staying at LLV. It was pretty empty because it was early, and on a Sunday in December. Service was great, atmosphere was very comfortable. Tuna tartare excellent. Flatbread very good. Wedge salad phenomenal. Salad w grilled chicken and cheeseburger were very good.   The filet for my daughter they asked me to let them butterfly it ?  We ordered hers to be cooked med well, mine medium. Not sure why they wanted to butterfly it because I also ordered a filet so both would be cooking roughly same time. So her's came out way overcooked and basically 36 dollars of well done cubed steak i could get at a diner.  My filet was perfectly cooked but had an odd seasoning / smell. Not sure what the dry rub is they use but it's not real good. Kind of too salty / fishy aroma. There was a new chef cooking that night so maybe it's just a breaking in period we hit.   Overall this is a great place. And with that is going to be a great bill. We were 2 adults and 2 kids, 1 bottle wine and 2 apps. 250 bucks with 20% tip. I definitely would have gone 5 stars without the filets issues.  I would come back...but only after winning a few hundred gambling to cover it."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here on the third day they were open. I expected glitches, but there weren't any! The design of the restaurant is very stylish and elegant. Our meals were superb!  My wife had the Halibut, and I had the Filet Mignon. This is easily the best steak in the village right now. My wife thought her meal was great. This would be a good night out if you are looking for a special date night out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service  Highly recommend   The halibut and pork chops were perfect  Crab cakes are perfection"}
{"text":"Do not recommend. I asked for a Cubano sandwich and ask that they leave the pickles out. Waitress came back and stated that the \"chef\" was not able to leave pickles out as it was pre-made with pickles already. We ordered two tapas orders, calamari and chicken garlic. The calamari came out however we had to cancel the chicken as it still had not come out when we were finished with our meals. The waitress stated that the dishes come out separately as they are cooked. I had the fish and chips which were mediocre and not worth $17.00.   We live in Lake Las Vegas and will never come back. Our meal took an hour and a half from start to finish."}
{"text":"Great location out in lake Las Vegas village. There is a small indoor area but plenty of seating outside. Being that you're out in lake Las Vegas there aren't many options but I would definitely recommend this place over any of the others nearby. The sangria is delicious and the tapas are great for sharing at a reasonable price. We had a new server who wasn't very knowledgeable on the menu but he was quick to go and ask his manager and come back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this steakhouse based on the Yelp reviews and ratings. I left unsatisfied and disappointed. The service was slow and the menu selection was limited. Came here with 2 other couples to celebrate our husbands for Father's Day and they ran out of Ribeye (the one thing our men wanted). We ordered the NY steak as recommended by the server just to be told 20 mins after that they have run out of that too and only one person at our table can get it. We ended up with salmon (the salmon was delish) and received multiple boats of \"complimentary mashed potatoes\" for the inconvenience. The one steak that was received at our table was not cooked as requested and overcooked.  The served poured water in the Sprite TWICE. We asked for separate checks in the very beginning and received one check at the end. When we reminded the server that we needed separate checks her acted like we inconvenienced him.  I will not be returning due to the slow service, lack of attention to detail/ request and the fact they don't have enough of their menu available."}
{"text":"Recently welcoming local favorite Chef Beni into the kitchen, E&H is on the shores of Lake Las Vegas- a relatively close dining option for Henderson residents, if a bit out of the way for others. I was at the lake for a SUP event with Neli T and Cathey K, and we came in for a late dinner.  TORTILLA ESPANOLA: Served as an apertif as we were seated, this is similar to an omelet, and was plated in a romesco sauce. Interesting. TOSTONES: Free with Yelp check in, these are mashed and fried plantains. I've had these elsewhere and they were salty, here they didn't have much flavor but were nicely crisped and served with two dipping sauces, a spicy ketchup and a \"mojo citrus garlic dip\" that didn't have much flavor to me. LATIN CANGREJO: This was their take on a crab cake, with a lime sweet chili sauce. Pretty decent, but for the $15 price tag could have used a third patty instead of just two. GRILLED FISH TACO: I'm not sure if these are usually served DIY style or if it's just because our server said the order comes with two and we were a party of three, but this was a bit odd. The mahi was decent, and I liked the salsa and slaw, but the tortillas were falling apart. We didn't finish this order. YUCCA FRIES: Nice presentation, served with the garlic aioli and spicy ketchup, didn't see the spanish sherry vinegar the menu mentions. I like this dish and I'm glad they have it, worth a try if you haven't had yucca before. SWEET PLATANOS: This was Neli's pick, she's the sweet tooth in our group. She seemed to enjoy the order, served in a pomegranate honey glaze and accented with fundido cheese. This was too sweet for me, personally, but I liked the soft texture. CUBANO PANINI: Menu says this is served with fries or a salad, but I think we were able to get a tapas version. Nicely crisped, comforting combination of flavors. LATIN LANGOSTA ROLL: A pair of mini rolls, served on sweet bread. The seafood salad mix was lightly seasoned and very fresh, glad we got this. GARLIC PRAWN: One of my favorite dishes of the night, featuring four large shrimp in a garlic-saffron sherry sauce with piquillo peppers and crostini. I really liked this. VELAZQUEZ FIRE & ICE LOBSTER: Best dish of the night! Generous portion of fresh lobster served in a warm saffron fish broth with creamy coconut sauce, sofrito sauce, and jalapeno ginger. This came together as a lobster curry, had a nice heat and a balanced flavor, would totally get this again.  Prices were generally pretty fair, and our total before tip came to about $100. Their online menu states that they have a tapa banquet dinner available for about $30/pp with six tapas, salads, and a dessert. Although our price came out to about the same amount, I like that we were able to try a lot of different things.  I didn't catch our server's name but she was very friendly, and the food came out quickly. We didn't realize until after we'd been seated that they close (relatively) early, at 9:30PM on a Saturday. Despite our late arrival, staff were happy to help us and we did not feel at all rushed. Location is nicely done up in a red and black color scheme with a large bar area and plenty of patio seating overlooking the lake. I hope they get enough business to stay open, as this is not a heavily-trafficked area of town."}
{"text":"Since the minute we walked in, we were treated perfectly. Lloyd took amazing care of us. He made us feel very comfortable and I honestly have never received better service elsewhere. Not just was the food amazing, but our service exceptional. Next time I come back to this area, this restaurant will be on my go-to list!"}
{"text":"Setting is nice enough and the service is well intentioned. But the menu falls short on variety.  Be careful if your meal includes a sauce. Square plates have very shallow rim. Waiter dripped sauce from my chicken picante all over my new linen slacks! The best he could do was offer to \"get me a rag\"!!  House salad was fresh and innovative. Three main courses were all too salty. Limited wine by the glass and no sparkling water available.   One more thing, standard height between chair and table is 12\". The ratio between the outdoor seating groups here is nearly 20\". Unless they add nice cushions to the seats, you will feel like you need a booster!"}
{"text":"Wow, all I can say is what a fabulous restaraunt, service, and excellent food, Essence and Herbs provides. We have traveled the world, frequented many 5 star restaraunts and this hidden gem fits the bill. We have eaten here several times and entertained many friends there and I am the hero! Bravo to all at Essence and Herbs! Bravo."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. We went on their grand opening, which you think would be a night were there might be a few things that weren't polished. But instead everything from the food to the service was amazing. We sat at the bar and the bar tender, Miguel, helped us order and treated us like we were the only people in the place. When we had questions about the ingredients in one of the dishes he had the owner/chef Manny come and talk to us. He told us about his vision for his restaurant and it was all about everyone eating great food and having fun doing it.   If you order one thing you have to have the scallops. Also order the Warm Chocolate Ganache, but do it when you order your meal, because they make it from scratch and it takes 20-30 mins.   We love this place and will be spending many of our future date nights eating tapas, paella, and drinking great wine  My only recommendation would be to include more Spanish wines on the menu. But beyond that come for the food and the fun."}
{"text":"Brunch with my family and its great! On the lake, live flamenco guitar player on the patio and great food with my good friend chef Beni! You must come and heck this place!!!"}
{"text":"Essence and Herbs is located near the Lake Las Vegas Marina. There isn't much at Lake Las Vegas, so I found myself here. There was a DJ and it sounded like it was crowded. Note that I said \"sounded like\"-- since it wasn't crowded at all.   Walked in and stood there for at least 10 minutes with no one asking if I was being helped. I saw servers walking to and from the patio and even other servers standing at the back by the kitchen. I picked up a menu from the hostess table and browsed while I stood there. And stood there. I made eye contact with a few of the servers and attempts to say something, but no one came to help me. But hey, at least the music was good! High five for that DJ.   I was just about to leave when finally someone came. I ordered a coke to go and then 10 minutes later, the guy comes back with a can of coke and for $4.  Yeah, I'd like to think that I helped a struggling business survive in that ghost town with the cost of that coke as my contribution. Sorry, I will not come back here."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter last Monday night.  Because I wanted it to be special bonding time on her winter break from school, while staying at Westin Hotel Lake Las Vegas.  Looks like we are the only customer at first, but there was a couple at the bar area.  We were not greeted  at first.  The first person we saw was the dishwasher smiled at us and he got our server for us.  The only server Server was not bad but couldn't needs more help because he was the only wait stuff in the whole restaurant. Bread needs more minutes in the microwave  and it was dry.  The French Onion Soup was salty.   I had a Seafood Chowder and it was not hot.  I ask for a Caesar salad instead.  But waiter gave me a green salad instead.  It taste like there's soil on those lettuce or arugula.  The steak was ok but not the best.  Mac and cheese was bland.  Mash potato was my favorite.  Asparagus was thick,taste ok too.  The 2 tiny slices of homemade butter was great!  I should say.  Desert came from Claim Jumper.  Better the the apple cobbler with ice cream that they wanted us to have at first.  I asked for decaf coffee, he gave me regular.  I know because I stayed up all night long, that night.  I'm caffeine sensitive.  Basically,  I work hard for my money paying that much for a steak is not worth it!  They need to work on the food temperature, portioning and pricing.  I don't think I would recommend this place to anybody who's like me."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  Great setting with water views, steak was wonderful.  We came here after eating at bobby flay's mesa grill and enjoyed the steak much more for about half the price.  Quiet and calming surrounding with great views.  We got a meal for two and all dishes were so tasty, even for my picky husband.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.  I have been a huge fan of Hanks and tried Essence tonight. What a hidden, quaint Gem.  The Salmon with spinach cream sauce and Broccoli was the best meal Ive ever had hands down. Im blown away.  Please don't read this and crowd this place. Crab cakes also top top notch. Its beyond words... Truly exceptional. 7 stars!!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and we enjoyed a price fixe menu. The salad and steak were both amazing. The dessert left a lot to be desired. I went again since they have started to transfer to a more tapas menu. We had the tuna ceviche, and the artichokes and calamari from the tapas menu. All three were very good. My only complaint is they only have a beer and wine permit so no hard alcohol."}
{"text":"Completely awful. Wouldn't go back here. Completely empty dining room but the kitchen was \"too busy\" to accommodate making eggs and bacon after being completely ignored by the waitstaff AND management for 15 mins. The waiter had the nerve  to ask \"Are your ready?!\" after not offering any beverages"}
{"text":"we went for a quiet dinner after just arriving back into town. I was very pleased with the service, Lloyd, his accent was thick but he totally made us laugh. Chef Paul cooked our steaks perfectly. the wine, the service, the food and company was perfect."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Laura is an amazing server! Bone in Ribeye and Chicken Cesar salad were both Fabulous! Prices were reasonable and live music on the grass every Saturday! Such a fun time!"}
{"text":"Luckily we stumbled upon this place while celebrating our anniversary and my husbands birthday at Lake Las Vegas. The flavor of everything was perfect! The steak was cooked to perfect at medium. The mac n cheese was seriously to die for. The broccoli was flavored with the pancetta. We will come back next time we are at Lake LV!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was not very good. It was Friday night and they only had 2 servers. There was no one greeting people at the door, and they took about 10-15 minutes to bring us the check after we had  asked for the bill. My husband had a Bud Light and the server charged us for a Stella, a difference of $1.50, not nice."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience.  The steak (rib eye) was cooked to perfection, the service was prompt, courteous and professional.  Current owners have had the place for a month or so, but it runs smoothly and with panache.  Give it a try and you will probably go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't need your money Waited 10 min at the entrance of the restaurant Plenty of available tables 3 servers discussing just beside us Other server crossed us and never talk to us Finally we dined at the Irish pub, superb service !!!!!"}
{"text":"Steaks were outstanding! Their mac & cheese was pretty awesome as well. Anthony our server was right on point. We will be back again. They will definitely get a five star review from us!"}
{"text":"Our  GPS kept giving us the run around when trying to find the restaurant  and now we think it was trying to tell us to avoid eating here.    They've only been open for 7 months and I don't honestly see how they can be around for much longer.  The decor was VERY orange with a floral arrangement at the entrance that looks like they swiped from a nearby cemetery ... dead. ..very dead.  There was a lot of clutter and we had a view of the kitchen trash cans and chaos.   They did a good job on the steak but it was way overpriced.  The CZR salad was awful and the mac n cheese had no flavor at all.  The lobster bisque was ok but way too salty.   We weren't the only guests sending food back to kitchen.    Our server did his best to make our visit not miserable.  We spent $80 and left hungry."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here tonight. Server Laura was great, food not so much. There were 6 adults & we all agreed. The clam chowder was luke warm & seriously tasted like canned Campbell's.  The coffee was cold too. The entrees were not tasty. Apparently they got a new chef last week who is \"trying out new things\". Even with half price apps for happy hour, I still wouldn't go back. My french onion soup was way too salty, and I love salt! The \"pom fritte's\" literally were seasoned curly fries straight outta the freezer section at the grocery store. The rolls were incredibly stale (but the butter was good). The bathrooms were stinky, like with a sewage smell. Menu items were not available. It was cold in there, despite multiple portable heaters set up inside. Our server Laura was great though."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner here with a couple colleagues and the food was alright, except the Mac & Cheese was fantastic.  The night we went, the staff seemed overwhelmed - there seemed to be only 2 servers, however one of them didn't know the menu nor new what they had at the bar.  Unfortunately, my vegetarian colleague got a Margarita Pizza which has a couple pieces of salami or pepperoni.  My Salad and Mac& Cheese were delicious though.  I heard great things about the steak although that night none of us tried them out.  I would give one more star if they had a full bar.  Waiting for that liquor license!"}
{"text":"Delicious Chilean Sea Bass & lobster for dinner. Everything we ordered was excellent. Our server John made amazing recommendations from the wine to the dessert. Highly recommend the bread pudding  thanks John!! *** please note that this restaurant is now called One5 Lakeside*** still excellent everything"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Westin and decided to come here based on the reviews. I can honestly say that our dinner was so delicious. Food and drinks perfect amazing combination. Customer service was magnificent. Everyone was so nice and made us feel very welcomed. Our bill was almost $200 i can say it was all worth it. You get what you pay for. We will be coming here again"}
{"text":"Love this new little gem! We ordered salmon and pancetta, essance salad and shrimp cocktail for apps. I would totally come back for the salad. It was delicious. The dressing was salty and sweet. Then we shared a New York steak, truffle fries, spinach and mushroom side! It was cooked to perfection and everything combined was so yummy!! Definitely recommend this place. Also had a wonderful harpist and tell Lloyd we said hello(our really nice waiter)."}
{"text":"Should you find yourself at the Hilton Lake Las Vegas, this is a pretty solid choice.  My friend and I tried a bunch of their tapas and were pretty happy with our selection.\  What I tried: Mac and Cheese- nice and cheesy with one of my favorite pasta shapes, campanelle Burrata with tomatoes- I'm a sucker for burrata, nice and creamy and fresh Sweet Plantains- the pomegranate jam is really bright, tart and sweet  Quinoa Tabbouleh- meh, this one was only okay. Not very flavorful and I didn't like the texture as much as traditional taboule"}
{"text":"Exceptional.  Scallops and crab cakes amazing.  Halibut and salmon cooked perfectly.  Service outstanding."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Lake Las Vegas period. If you enjoy steakhouses then this is the place for you. I ordered the Boneless RibEye and it was like eating cotton candy! Mouth watering succulence at its finest. Make sure you get a side of their Mac & Cheese, you will NOT be disappointed. Very flavorful.   The service was remarkable! It seemed like I had multiple servers. Everyone was so helpful and courteous. It was very appreciative.   The view from the patio is amazing. It's right by the water and the main stage inside Lake Las Vegas.   If you want a nice night out with your significant other then come to this place."}
{"text":"WOW!  WOW!  WOW!  If you want to be wowed, this is THE place to go!  It was, by far, the best steak dinner I've ever had.  The service was excellent, and the decor was very nice.    We had the crab cakes to start, the sauce was excellent and the cakes were small, but huge in flavor! (If you have that, you really have to eat it in tiny bites...so good).  My husband had the Lobster Bisque, and he really enjoyed that.    For our main course, I had the filet mignon, and my husband had the 20 oz New York steak, both were cooked perfectly.  The sides were awesome (mash potatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus).  I cannot say enough about how great this place is, it was worth every penny.  We didn't try any desserts because we were too full.  We've found our new favorite steakhouse, and it's at Lake Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was there at a business dinner. The service was great and so was the food. The appetizers were also delicious. There is indoor and outdoor seating. I really enjoyed my meal. The prices are high so it's not just a casual stop although it's not a place to dress up."}
{"text":"Located in the \"The Village\" in the upscale neighborhood development of Lake Las Vegas, you'll find this restaurant lakeside outside at the Hilton.  There is outside seating and spring concerts on weekends right outside the restaurant on a common lawn. If you're looking for steak at \"old Vegas\" prices, this is NOT the place to go. Expect to pay $40+ for an a la carte steak which is atrocious to pay 30 minutes outside of Vegas, let alone in Vegas.  This place is no \"gem\" as others have described. It's located in a strip mall where half the stores are vacant or close early on weekends, even the ice cream shop was closed at 8 pm on a Saturday night! The food is on par but for $10 more you could get a steak at Mortons that tastes 100x better and with better service. In my opinion, I'm not looking to pay that kind of money for food in Henderson nor in Vegas. The steak was cooked just as ordered, I had the ribeye medium rare. I ordered the the mushroom Madeira sauce to accompany the steak at an extra cost of $3.00 for two table spoons; the sauce tasted burnt and looked like thick plum paste. My wife ordered the ahi salad which was on par, no glorious moments here. We also ordered the filet mignon and it too was on par. The service was subpar as we did not get the bearnaise sauce we had ordered, but the waiter quickly resolved this.  Bread service was horrible; if I'm paying these kinds of prices I expect something a little more gourmet than standard store-bought dinner rolls and some concoction of sugar, cinnamon, and butter. Macaroni and cheese was good though! This place is definitely not worth the price. I do not recommend this restaurant if you have the chance to venture away from the neighborhood. See pic of menu."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience and even more amazing food. Apparently their menu is changing to tapas (which is so fun) and my family and I got to try a few. They only had about 15 at the time but was told they will have a full menu starting this week. Such a gorgeous place and the staff was wonderful. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  Last Tuesday they hosted a dinner for my work team. About 20 people.  They did a wonderful job accommodating us...creating a menu for us and accommodate all of our last minute changes! Very flexible.  Cool location. Great ambiance.  Great food.  Wonderful service!!"}
{"text":"We were undecided in where to eat while walking around the village.  We looked at the new tapas menu and decided that would fit the bill. I highly recommend the lobster rolls, they were so yummy and buttery. Also I would say the mahi mahi fish tacos are some of the best I've had. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We returned to Essence and Herbs for our 7 year anniversary, after loving our first experience here last year.  But things have changed for the worse.  When we arrived, they were busy and it was a few minutes before we were greeted. No big deal, I understand it gets busy. They said they didn't have our reservation. I did it online, then left a voicemail and also called before we left. (yes, I am a freak like that). I knew it wasn't possible that they didn't have our reservation. I looked at their book and there was my last name, crossed off. I didn't want to make a big stink on our anniversary and they said they could seat us. The problem was that I said I wanted to sit on the outside patio. The first time they tried to seat us, they said us at the top of the stairs. It was literally in front of the railing at the top of the stairs. I should have left then, but our experience there before was so great, we decided to stay. We asked for a different table.   This table had a nice view. They had portable misters working to cool off the patio and they worked well. The only issue they sat us next to some old blowhard douchebag with his douchebag son complete with a man bun. I guess he was the president of the HOA at Lake Las Vegas and they were kissing his ass hard. I had to listen to him berate the server and complain about everything the entire time we were there. He insisted they bring one of the misters to his table for only them. So the mister that we would have shared with everyone was only on his selfish entitled ass. I really wanted to say something (in my head, I punched him in the face 100 times), but once again, its my anniversary. We really should have just left.  10 minutes went buy and we had no menus. We did however get water and order some sangrias which took 15 minutes to arrive. We are looking around and noticed we were never greeted by a server and there were servers on both sides of us. It seemed like the one server that had to wait on douchebag wasn't taking any more tables and the other server who was an older guy with a ponytail going down his back was busy too. So that left us with no server. Again, my little voice was saying \"go to Sunset and Vines, it's very consistent\".  The woman that greeted us, hostess? assistant manager? I have no idea. I do know she sure as hell wasn't one of the wait staff. She gives us menus and says she couldn't find menus.  They are transitioning from steaks and seafood to Tapas. This was not reflected on their online menu. There menu was pretty limited to 3 entrees. Ribeye, Stuffed Pork Chop or Chilean Sea Bass. We started with some tapas and I chose stuffed pork chop, my wife ordered the fish. We didn't get our appetizers for about 25 minutes. They clear our plates and the non server woman comes out and tells me they are out of the pork chop, I order ribeye, they are out of that and they are also out of sea bass. We put our order in around 8 pm. They ran out of all of their entrée selections by 8 pm on a Saturday night? What chef doesn't supply his restaurant like this? I ended up getting 3 tapas for dinner I wanted the paella but guess what? They were out of that too .They somehow managed to have enough fish for my wife's order. So that was a good thing (happy wife, happy life)  We got the appetizers, I got the scallops and she got the spicy shrimp. The scallops were delicious. My wife said they shrimp didn't have much flavor.  For dinner, I had the sautéed calamari, fish tacos and Spanish chorizo and egg tapas. Fish taco, delicious, it was deconstructed. All of the condiments were great. Calamari, wonderful, perfectly cooked Spanish chorizo and eggs. The egg was overcooked. You want it to break and all of that yolky goodness to mix with the chorizo. It was also LOADED with potatoes. It was more than half potatoes. The flavor was very good though.  My wife's bass. It was different from before. They season it was some Spanish seasoning that had cumin in it. It didn't say that on the menu . She wasn't a fan.  As we got our entrees, the misters shut off, the batteries ran out? No idea, but the patio heated up and got uncomfortably hot and humid. by now, I'm soaking wet from sweat and just ready to just leave.  The wait between courses was ridiculously slow, over 30 minutes. Our reservation was at 7:30 and we didn't leave until around 9:45  The person who waited on us was just apologizing and making excuses all night. I don't know what happened but it was a terrible experience overall.  I hope they figure out what they need to do. Because we won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! Laura was my server and she did amazing! Made us feel very welcomed. The food was delicious. I ate the tequila chicken with pasta and it was probably the best pasta I have ever tasted. The manager Daniel was very attentive as well, he came by to make sure we were doing well. Thank you again! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"we made a reservation for 7 for a 2pm seating  on Easter. We arrived we stood in the entry for a solid 10 minutes the place was EMPTY inside a couple of tables looked they were finishing up outside. A man was on the phone showing no interest in seating us. We told excuse me we have a reservation - he checked us in \"motioned\" for us to follow him and showed us to a table and \"left\" us there - after another 15 minutes, no waiter no water we asked can we get service a waiter shows up and says \"are you ready\" - are we ready no one has been here- menus - ok I asked we have a fussy eater can we just have bacon and eggs for him - he explains the chef is too busy to go off the menu ..... too busy we're the only ones here !!!! Needless to say we just got up and left.   Update: the manager Max invited us back as his guest - quite a different experience - the location is beautiful - ambiance with Live music made it a beautiful experience Service by John was perfect - food was excellent I had the French toast - thank you Max we had a beautiful afternoon."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious but the view is beautiful and staff is kind and attentive. We visited for our anniversary and were blown away by the attention to detail and how personable our server was. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My best friend has her wedding here for 60 people. The food was amazing and quite honestly, the best I've ever had! There was prime rib, ribs, shrimp curry with regular and fried rice, salad... You name it! And it was all actually GREAT! Everything was moist and tender! Not dry at all! I highly recommend this restaurant. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  We chose it for our wedding rehearsal dinner and it could not have gone any better.  The manager, Chanthy, helped planning every detail and it was executed to perfection.  Every single item of food we ate was delicious and the service was on point as well.  I highly recommend this place - whether for an intimate dinner date or a group outing.  You will undoubtedly leave VERY full because you won't want to stop eating.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Here at the resort for a meeting and thought I'd check this restaurant out for dinner because of the reviews. Service was TERRIBLE!!! I waited a good 10 minutes for someone to pay attention that I was standing there wanting for a table. I could have understood a bit more if they were busy but they weren't. I finally got seated only to wait another 10 minutes for someone to come by. I got my menu and yes, it took forever to come and take my order. Finally, got my order which wasn't complicated.  I asked at that time if I could have some more water?  I didn't see the waiter again until I got his attention to come to the table. I got my check and left. It was ridiculous!!!  Worst service I've seen in a long time."}
{"text":"This is by far one of best tapas restaurants I have ever come across. It is right on the water so it's is beautiful. The Latin cangrejo along with all the other dishes was amazing. The sangria was also amazing , if you go there it is a definite must. I loved this place along with all the serving staff and chef beni is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying my dinner was disappointing but it may have been my own fault.  Hubby and I went here for our 47th wedding anniversary.  We had wanted to go to Marssa at the Westin but before checking in, no one had told us the restaurant was closed that night.  We went to Essence and Herbs instead.  I was in the mood for fish and my only choice was Ahi.  It was prepared blackened which I do not like.  I asked the waiter if the preparation could not be blackened.  He assured me it could.  My mistake was here.  I should have given him a hint of what else might be done with it (sesame crusted, wasabi cream - something) but I hoped the chef might take the opportunity to be creative. What I got was bland, plain Ahi.  It came with a slaw that had a weird flavor that made me wonder if it was supposed to taste that way or if it had spoiled.  Hubby's Fliet Mignon was awesome and the crispy fried onions served with it were delicious.   Though I accept partial blame for my bland meal, wouldn't a really great chef offer a different preparation choice?  Even Sierra Gold offers a sesame choice if you ask for no blackening.  Lesson learned.  I doubt we'll be back.  There was some kind of event going on and the quiet atmosphere we found when we entered was soon loud and frantic with event-goers parading past our table to an appetizer station set up on the table next to us.  So much for a romantic anniversary."}
{"text":"This place knocked the socks off my taste buds!!! We had a big group with us so we order multiple entrees and a few appetizers, so I was able to try quite a myriad of items! The standout dish was either the lobster tail or the halibut with its spectacular champagne cream sauceI also tried the filet mignon and the chicken picatta, to be honest I could rave about everything I tasted but I'll cut it short! The service was great very friendly, this place is fabulous!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a drive to check out Lake Las Vegas, we were hungry and this restaurant had Tapas menu, the weather was amazing, beautiful location  so we went in. Nice place, friendly staff, food was okay, we tried the Scottish Salmon Sashimi, Wagyu beef slider and crab cake with nice  Sauvignon blanc. Overall experience was good although the service was super slow but I will go back again but I will make sure I have enough time to live through slow service."}
{"text":"Wow! We ate here on a spur of the moment trip to lake Las Vegas.  We're locals and come down to the lake from time to time. Service was amazing. Daniel took great care of us and personally made sure our experience was top notch. The food was awesome. We had the filet and the ny steak. Cooked to perfection.  All the sides were perfect!  I highly recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"10 stars if possible! My love brought me here for valentines dinner and it was such a wonderful experience. To start he had the seared salmon salad and I ordered the avocado flan...avocado flan!! Both were superb but the flan was by far the most delicious thing I have tasted. Entrees consisted of fillet minion for him and succulent lobster tail for me. Both meals were prepared perfectly. Very tasty. We ended the meal with plantain and pecan baclava served with ice cream  and a cappuccino, delicious. I love dining at restaurants that pays attention to detail. This place truly impressed me. The place itself is not too big, very intimate and ambience was wonderful. The music was lively and the staff were super friendly. Lake Las Vegas and the restaurants on site never fail."}
{"text":"I had both my rehearsal dinner and my wedding reception here. The food was amazing. The chicken and ribs were tender, moist and flavorful. The mash potatoes were amazing. We also had fried rice, salad, and shrimp, which was tasty as well. Everything was cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was great and the staff were professional and wonderful. The owner made sure we had a memorable experience. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Be relaxed while waiting be served. This was my first time here and the lack of attention sucked, but I am glad I stayed."}
{"text":"Totally fabulous tapas, and an all around wonderful experience.   Location is fantastic, right on Lake Las Vegas, with plenty of outdoor seating.   A very large tapas menu, of which we sampled a multitude of dishes.  All wonderful.  The paella also had excellent flavor.   They also have 3 different types of sangria, and we liked all.  While Thursday they offer all you can eat tapas for $20, we were there on a different night, and price did not come out much more than this.   A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  We arrived at approximately 6:00 on a Friday evening and were impressed with both service and food.  All of the staff was courteous, attentive, professional and knowledgeable of the menu.  I ordered the spicy sea bass and it was heavenly.  For dessert, my daughter ordered the bread pudding and it was probably the best we have ever had.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. Had the paella, the lobster taste old, the mussels not fresh, but frozen. Dish was dry and the price 40.00...not worth your hard earned income..highway robbery...also notified our waitress of our disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday and caught their daily happy hour and had some appetizers and it was great and tasty. I definitely recommend this place to people. Especially to bring a date  ."}
