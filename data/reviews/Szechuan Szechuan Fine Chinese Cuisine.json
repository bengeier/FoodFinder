{"text":"I eat lunch here at least once a week and the quality is top notch. Always. No rubbery chicken or beef in the form of leather snipets. Just the right level of spice."}
{"text":"It's good to know they make the hot and sour soup in house and not some canned stuff but the way I found out was not good - large pieces of egg shells in my soup."}
{"text":"In the dictionaries that are Chinese menus, I have dug deep and found the diamond in the rough. I am only rating this one dish five stars, not the restaurant.  The spicy peanut chicken!  The sauce is hot and amazing, accompanying the chicken are water chestnuts, a heap of peanuts and celery that add the perfect crunch.  If you are going for lunch in the PATH downtown, order this!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering their take out for dinner for the past 2 weeks as my Mother is on vacation and we're too lazy to cook after work! 

The food  is always hot and flavorful even if it's not authentic Chinese. It gets very busy during the week day lunch times, but quiets down during the week day dinner times. I guess the business people in the financial district go home and the rest forget about them...They're closed on the weekends.

The food is a bit more pricey compared to the Chinese restaurants in China town and outside downtown.  However, we are in the financial district after all.  The best thing is that they do not add MSG either or at least not a lot so that my nephew will experience a reaction to it. 

This is my top  boss' favorite Chinese restaurant and the only one she'll go too.

Like most restaurants, there are some that they do well and some that they don't do as well:

Avoid-Hot and sour soup unless you like to taste lots of starch and no substance (chicken/shrimp)

Do order: Cashew chicken/general Tao and stir fry chicken with vegetables, Schewan noodles. 

The portions are average to fill you up, but not huge to leave you asking for a doggie bag."}
{"text":"For a downtown Chinese restaurant, they monopolize the business of decent Chinese food ...they are located in the best possible spot so sometimes they can give poor service and people will still go back. 

I had many working lunches ere - indifferent waiters, horrible tea (cheap jasmine tea bag and they charged you a premium) and salty food. 

Luncheon specials are okay but you drink lots of water and expect lots of calories in the starchy gravy.  Tried to order from menu and not luncheon specials because they literally scooped it from their take out area. They taste the same but you pay fore pleasure. 

Their service are n consistent.  All their servers are male and they can be crusty old man. They are rude if you are Asian because they figure  that Asians tend to tip less (yes it may be true but why are they rude n the first place).

Downtown financial districts need better Chinese restaurant 

Try Akco Lounge  instead, they are much better and nicer people."}
{"text":"Looking for dinner in the PATH at 8pm on a weeknight can be challenging.  Thank goodness Szechuan Szechuan was still open!  I usually like my Chinese food cheap and greasy, but this place was a little classier than I am.  Very nice d√©cor and very clean, especially for an Asian restaurant.

Lots of options for meals for two, three, four or six which offer a nice variety of a couple of dishes.  Otherwise, the food you order comes in a portion good for sharing.  The side of rice costs extra ($1.75) unless you order the Special of the Day which includes the rice and a soup of choice, which I did.  I tried the hot and sour soup - not bad.  Lots of ingredients, a little on the thick side and a little too sour.  I ordered the spicy peanut chicken which was slathered in sauce and cooked with celery, red peppers, water chestnuts and peanuts.  Very tender and tasty - definitely needed the rice.

My date ordered the Pad Thai.  Excellent consistency and the chicken and shrimp were large.  Very tasty, but not much spice.

Service was good.  Food was delicious, although I expected spicier for a Szechuan restaurant.  Both portions were generous and we had leftovers to take home.

They also offer special dishes like Peking duck or lobster dinners, but they need to be ordered ahead of time."}
{"text":"Not sure how authentic this place is as far as Szechuan cusine goes but I found the food here to be top notch. The crispy beef here was the best  Ive had and after tasting it I went on a lame quest around the GTA to search for a place that had the same dish which would have served as my cheaper alternative. Though I did not find something of similar quality, I did find a few spots that filled the void.

This place has a take out sort of setup for those who do not want to dine in restaurant style but I've never tried it. Everything else I tried was good though a tad oily.

In a nutshell, great food albeit a bit too fattening to have everyday."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I ate here many times. Service is always good and very fast. Can get really busy at lunch. Portion size is average when you eat in the restaurant but very large at the take-out counter.  Tried many dishes and liked them all except the cashew chicken and General Tao chicken - the sauce was way to heavy and rather greasy. My fav.  is the Chicken in Black Bean sauce with steamed rice. There is a mini menu for take-out  with many good items. There is also a location in Vaughn Mills with most of the same dishes but with Sushi options as well."}
{"text":"The food tastes amazing.   It is insanely busy at lunch but they always get my pickup order correct.

Supper time is much more relaxing without an army of customers everywhere.   Its a great place to take someone on a date or a business dinner."}
{"text":"This is the HQ of fast chinese food in the area.  They've launched forays into the food court proper at First Canadian and into all the surrounding food courts as well.  But this is the center of it all.

From outside, lunch line ups look impossibly long.  But they are a mix of eat-in and take-out patrons, and both move with incredible speed.  Eat in lunches are cheap, plentiful and deliciously greasy in the Szechuan style.  Nothing is terribly innovative or inventive, but hey, this is banker food court fare.  The hot and sour soup is respectable, and pretty much everything is delicious.  

I would love to hate this kind of food corp machine, but when you're in the neighbourhood and looking for a quick lunch, it's really quite good."}
{"text":"I have a dear friend who has had seasons tickets for the Raptors for three or four years now - so we go often. We always park at FCP ($8!) and we meet at Szechuan Szechuan for takeout in the food court before walking through the PATH to the ACC.

I am always very attentive to shrimp size and distribution as it is the most skimped upon and over charged for protein in asian restaurants of all kinds. Szechuan Szechuan does not cheap out! Noodles always cooked proper, food always tasty."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the staff at their take-out location in First Canadian Place are very rude. I asked the server about a certain item and she said look at the sign in a rude tone. I don't understand why she couldn't have told me instead of being rude for no reason. While I was asking the same server about another iterm, she left and helped another customer. I wouldn't go here again. The food isn't worth the rude service."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today with a colleague.

We were seated almost immediately and our server quickly brought us our drinks and took our food order.

We ordered the Thai green curry chicken and the General Tso chicken.  The food was good.  I've eaten here many times and the food is consistently good.  

Our mains were brought to us within 5 minutes, which was great.  The portion sizes were ok, not enourmous.

Total bill was $32 and change, which personally I found to be a bit expensive for what we got, keeping in mind that we did not have appetizers, or dessert and that our drinks were ice water.

The place is quite large with ample seating and a really nice patio so it gets points for that.

I would recommend this place for larger groups because of the large seating and the fact that you could order several plates and share."}
{"text":"Oh Szechuan why must you break my heart with your callous disregard for my sensibilities, yet satisfy me with your deadly flavoured food?

I've eaten work lunches (team meetings, one on ones) several times and have had excellent service. But last Friday left a lot to be desired. The hostess could not accommodate my group and ended up seating a 9 person group in 2 separate tables. Or rather, one table and the bar. That's not a problem. The problem became when the server at the bar offered my group in the bar the nearest table that became available. We started moving our glasses, as he instructed, when suddenly the hostess came in screeching and yelling we could not do that. Well, quite the scene she caused!

We ordered the spicy peanut chicken, szechuan beef, lemon chicken, veggies and chicken fried rice. It was exquisite. What can I say? The food itself is delightful so much so, I can find it easy in my heart to forgive their rude transgression."}
{"text":"Another business trip, another chance to try somewhere new!  

I had some trouble finding the restaurant, but I attribute this to being a tourist and too cheap for a data plan with GPS on my phone.  The cleaning staff eventually pointed me in the right direction (under the BMO, west side of the food court of First Canada Place).  It was around 6:40 pm by the time I found my way out of the underground labyrinth and the restaurant was empty, save for a couple people waiting for take out.  To be fair, it was the Tuesday after the long weekend.  From what I saw, the decorations, cleanliness and overall impression was great!  

My plan was to order the ginger beef based on the reviews and a side of steamed rice.  I've mentioned before in my reviews that I am from out west and it has been really hard for me to find good ginger beef in Ontario.   I thought it was kind of pricey for the one dish ($12.95) and plain rice ($1.75), but, hey, I think everything is pricey (I'm pushing 40 after all) and I was too hungry to care after 45 min of being lost.  The staff were really friendly and my order was ready after about 3 or 4 min... which was great, but you gotta wonder how come it took so little time to prepare... It's no secret the deep-fried meats are all pre-made, but they are usually warmed up in a super-wok. 

Anyways, once I returned to my hotel (thank goodness I found my way back rather quickly), I was drooling in anticipation... finally I could dig in!  The rice was decent... but kind of on the dry side.   The beef, although not the ginger beef of my dreams, was tasty and very good flavour wise.  It had about the right heat, but I would have preferred a little more sauce and the sauce to be a wee bit sweeter and more gingery.  All and all, good eats."}
{"text":"Super quick service, great if you're in the mood for chinese food for lunch in the financial district. They also do delivery and take-out. My co-workers order from here all the time, and we are always very satisfied with the quick service and consistent quality of the food.

True, it's not gourmet or even very \"authentic\" chinese food, but it's a solid choice as any in the finance district. The food is tasty and fast, satisfying my 2 primary criteria for lunch on a workday."}
{"text":"if you want five different meats and six different veggies covered in the same sauce, this is your place.

crappy service.  sometimes too busy to deliver.  no thanks."}
{"text":"I always love coming to Toronto to visit friends and see the sights. Every time I'm in town, I have to come to this place. The food is always so good. Sometimes the wait staff can be a little chilly as far as reception is concerned, but has always been spectacular. The food came quickly and, as mentioned before, was very good. Definitely, I recommend this place for business lunches. I will be returning here when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"My downtown coworkers love eating out... I don't blame them as they have the dining world at their feet at King and Bay.  Most often, we'd head to a food court but at times, the group wants something a little more formal than a grab and dash but still very quick on the service.  This place fits the bill nicely.  This sits above ground level in the First Canadian Place building and it's REALLY busy.  It offers quasi authentic Chinese food at lightning fast service but at fairly steep price.

The atmosphere is quite nice as it mimics the FCP building... open, clean, and modern.  It's quite loud here as they cram tables and body into this space.  Even though it is a fairly large place, during lunch time, you're elbow to elbow from the moment you walk into the lobby.  It doesn't help their take out counter is also in the lobby as well and they're yelling out order numbers and such.

Our group of 8 had reservations and we were seated within minutes.  Quite quickly menus were dropped at our table and drink orders were taken.  There are many wait staff running about and seeing how fast they bring the food out and turn the tables around, I can see why!  Our server was polite but clearly busy.  We ordered 5 plates to share for our group. 

The Schezuan beef came out in less than 5 minutes.  I think they must make this in ridiculously large batches as no one I know has ever waited more than 5 minutes after an order of this.  It came really hot, brown, gooey, mildly spiced, and salty.  Most of my co-workers (who are not Asian) loved this dish.  I don't mind it but it's slightly too gooey from excessive brown sludge syndrome (too much corn starch and soy sauce).  I wouldn't order it personally but considering what it is (quasi Chinese food), it's fresh and the beef was tender and not overcooked (I wish I could say the same for the sauce).  

Cashew chicken followed by the lemon chicken came a few moments later.  Similar to the Schezuan beef, it came hot and freshly made.  The pieces of chicken were nicely cut and none of the excessive fatty or tendon pieces were in it.  Lemon chicken is what it is... sweet and goopy over crispy battered chicken pieces.  My coworkers ate this up in minutes and it was gone faster than you can say \"gwai lo food\". From the piece I had, I can see why they would like it.  Lemon flavour was bright and bold with a slight tang.  The goopy, sweet, and deep fried batter component makes it a guilty pleasure like a McDonalds apple 'pie'.   Cashew chicken was decent.  Definitely better than any of the food court Chinese food as it had fresh vegetables.  The last thing that arrived was the fried rice.  It's better than the food court as it has real pieces of vegetables (not frozen), shrimp, and pork.  It wasn't overly oily either which was a pleasant change from food court rice.

The price tag is expensive for decent quasi Chinese food especially if you compare it to any HK cafe out in the east end.  Considering you're at King and Bay, it's still expensive but the quality over regular food court Chinese food is noticeable.  I think it's popular because it really caters to non-Asians in a super convenient location, consistently fresh and decent, and really really fast.  I personally would rather walk to an authentic Chinese restaurant nearby and pay half the amount for similar food but when dining among less adventurous colleagues, the path of least resistance (apprehension) is often the case."}
{"text":"Not bad. Nice quiet atmosphere located in the PATH and open after work hours. The staff are very friendly and attentive. I just accidentally glanced at the server's way, and he immediately responded - not so typical in a Chinese restaurant.

Got the lemon chicken and spicy eggplant for sharing.. yumm!

Lunch time is a totally different experience. It is busy! They have set lunch menu or my preference order dishes to share with separe order of rice ($1.75).

Remember to call in to get a table or you will find yourself at the bar unless thats your thing.

They also have a lunch takeout menu (~$9). Yet to try it.. as I like to dine in.
