{"text":"Very authentic food, I'm a huge fan! I don't know much about the West Valley, I only work out here so I was very happy to find some great Mexican food. Family owned and has been in the area for over 40 years. I highly recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Waitress put chips on table, left didn't ask what we wanted to drink. Finally came back dropped off salsa and left again. When she returned wanted to know if we were ready to order. Still hadn't got drinks yet. Don't try to order anything slightly different from the menu even though they have the same ingredients. They will not do it. So we left."}
{"text":"My family and I went last week. The way I like to rate Mexican places is by their chips and salsa. If they have good salsa, normally their food is good. If their salsa is full of flavor, their food will also contain flavor. Tis place had good salsa that was spicy. So, I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were in almost a tomato sauce. Not a lot, just a little. First reaction was huh? But then I tried it. Oh my they were very yummy! I darn near licked my plate when I was done. The only complaint I would have was the rice. Not sure if it was yesterday's or just undercooked. But..... Everything else was very good. The place is small, so be prepared, probably only 15 tables."}
{"text":"This place was great! Found this on a search while we were in town for Spring Training games. Tastes like real authentic Mexican food. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute dive, not even worthy of the one star I'm forced to leave to place this review. We sat in the restaurant for over a half an hour the waitress managed to bring a basket of chips with no salsa. We could not even get a glass of water and the place was empty. When we got up to leave the waitress said sarcastically did you change your mind. And when I responded that we had sat there for a long time without so much as a glass of water she just laughed as we walked out the door. Avoid this hole and try Raul and Theresa's one block down the street the food is fantastic as well as the service."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place :) been going here for years, ever since I was a kid. Service is excellent, aphonsphere is nice, and the food is delicious! I love this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. And now my high school mates and their family run the restaurant passed down from their family, and excellence in the food family fun atmosphere is always welcomed private family birthday parties As well as my family coming from out of town still wanting to come to the small yet wonderful restaurant. Blessings to all thanks Aaron for taking care of us all in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly atmosphere, way better than the place next door...prices good..salsa amazing"}
{"text":"A group of us found Tony's after Raul & Theresa's was too busy.  And we have been back at least 6 times in the last few months.  The waitresses are so very nice and friendly and great to deal with!  The food is DELICIOUS!
Every time our group has gone each person is happy with their food, either it's gone or it's so good and great for leftovers!  

It is a very small location so there may be times you will need to wait, our last group was 12 and we had stellar service!"}
{"text":"Laid back Mexican restaurant, good service, quality food and excellent beverages. The overall quality of service was the best part, the food could have been better but I certainly was not complaining. I would return again if in the area"}
{"text":"Great food, incredible value.  Friendly service.  The restaurant is very small, perhaps once a small home, however, there is usually plenty of room and they can accomodate nearly any sized party.  If you are looking for a good meal, without a lot of ambiance, this is the place to good in Avondale."}
{"text":"I have been a Tony's regular for over 30 years.  I have never had a bad meal.  My husband loves the #3, chili relleno, beef taco, rice and beans, I get the #1, tostado, taco, cheese enchilada, rice and beans.  The restaurant is small, but huge compared to what it was when it opened about 40 years ago.  It is a family owned business, sometimes Tony is there, just sitting at a table, he doesn't work there any longer due to age and health.  My daughter in Iowa insists on eating there numerous times when she comes home for a visit.  It is not the fancy, lettuce covered mexican type food that you find at places like Macayo's or Garcia's, just good, traditional mexican food.  The quesadillas are the best as are the chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Went out with my bf last night in search of some excellent Mexican food.  Preferably a new place, but the places we found on the west side weren't exactly blowing our minds, if you know what I mean.....  We stumbled across Tony's and were very glad we did.  The hot sauce that came with the chips was spicy but not too spicy.....  We enjoyed it quite a bit.  We both ordered the reasonably priced margaritas, which were grande!  Both in taste and size.  We ordered combo plates (#1 and #6) that included tostadas, tacos, enchiladas, and a burrito.  The food was served nice and hot!  The service was excellent, and our overall experience was great.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Based on recommendations from friends I decided to try Tony's Cafe for lunch today. The service was great and the staff was very pleasant. I ordered the Carne Asada plate and was disappointed with the steak. The flavor was great but the meat seemed overcooked. It was tough and difficult to cut especially across the grain even with a steak knife."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for a Mexican Restaurant with reasonable prices and excellent food. The place was reasonably clean and service wasn't bad. My low rating is strictly because of the food. I had a taco and enchilada plate with rice and beans. The tacos hardshell like like you get from Taco Bell. I definitely would not call this authentic  Mexican. Do yourself a big favor. Go to Carolina's on Dysart and MC 85. They make fresh flour tortillas in front of big glass windows awesome! A must try is their TAMALES! Best I have ever eaten from a restaurant. Rivals some that are homemade."}
{"text":"My very favorite go to Mexican restaraunt. Have lived in the valley since 1988 and hands down from the friendly staff, delicious iced tea, salsa and chili rellenos to write home about this place is frickin fantastic!!! Don't let the trailer appearance scare you off, be brave you can do it! Your bravery will be well rewarded!"}
{"text":"Best I mean best Mexican food I have ever had. This will be a regular spot now for my family and I. So glad that we found this place."}
{"text":"Taco love. This place passes all my requirements.  Local, family owned, real ethnic food, and yes divey. Not divey in bad way. 

When the fork goes in the crunch is audible. Chicken Chimichanga was crunchingly condiment ally perfect.  Yes I make up words. Ample sour cream guac and salsa.  Block building, check, daughter of the owner smilingly serving perfection, check, not in a strip mall? Check check!!  

Try everything, it's a command."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant!!  I have been going since I was about 5.  Don't let the outside appearance scare you away the food is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I like Tony's a lot for the quick hole-in-the-wall Mexican type-deal.  Their tortillas (pretty much the most important part at a place like this) are very good, and they have great, fast service.  The salsa is fantastic too, if you can handle the heat."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in the far west valley, place is small but attentive. Green Chili is my go to for new restaurants and they didn't disappoint me. This place hasn't been in business this long without serving good home cooked meals"}
{"text":"Dinner time, service was very friendly 
Food portions were a great value and the food was very good.  Green chilli was outa this world along with the chilli rellano. 
I recomend driving from anywhere in phoenix  to enjoy great cooking and a huge 4.75 margarita"}
{"text":"I stopped in here last Friday before my boyfriend and I hit the road for Tucson. He suggested the place and I'd never been there, so I had no idea that the tiny little building we passed all the time was actually where we were going. Parking here is ridiculous, they certainly didn't plan it very well when it was built or it was never intended to be a restaurant. Whichever the case, we went in and were greeted by a friendly woman who would also be our server. 

The place is just as small on the inside as it looks from the street, but its got a sort of Mom & Pop charm. This could have been that there were two waitresses/older ladies in aprons sitting at a table speaking in Spanish, a little girl playing on that side of the room, and an elderly gentleman just sitting at a table listening to them (not eating, or being helped by any of the staff). Either way, it was cozy and nice. 

I found it strange, but not annoying to sit right under a television while we ate. Hey, I enjoyed the Judge Joe Brown episode we were in time for. The prices for our food were very reasonable and we were given chips and homemade salsa while we waited. Just a few minutes later, maybe 10-15, our food was ready. Everything was good and hot, but gave me heartburn & an upset stomach later. For this, I blame my boyfriend for not telling me until after the fact that he'd gotten sick once eating there because the food was just too heavy.

Anyways, solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"My Family's second visit here. Love the food!! If the chips and salsa are good you know the food is gonna be bomb!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant! I lover their chicken enchiladas. Unlike so many others, they use white meat and they are really great. My wife usually gets the chimichanga or tacos and raves about both. I love small hole wall places like this!"}
{"text":"We drive by all the time and never know when it is open.  We finally hit the jackpot today!  It is just a hole in the wall.  Tony's is spotlessly clean.  The service is very friendly.  
I ordered the huevos rancheros.  It was a little different than I have ever had them, but boy were they delicious!!!  My husband had chorizo and scrambled eggs.  He was trying to lick his plate.  
The food comes out bubbling hot, literally.  
The downside-they only have regular coffee, no decaf.  My husband had the coffee and said it was very good.  They also only serve powdered creamer.   It was also very cold in there.  I can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"You might drive past but that would be a mistake !

Huge portion of authentic food. Prices are spot on and flavors are as well. Go there once and you will go often"}
{"text":"Love this place, such great food!! If you haven't tried it, it's a must! The place is small, so get there early and grab a table. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place always has good food and the guacamole is amazing ice been going here for years."}
{"text":"Butter crisp is a tasty appetizer. The place is a little small and the food ok. The waitress/ owner is always smiling and friendly. Service is fast. Chips and salsa is good. Nice little place to have on the way west side of town to have a meal. Red cheese enchiladas are good. I don't really care for the rice."}
{"text":"My husband had Huevos Rancheros and said they were awesome. I had a chicken chimichanga and it was fantastic and HUGE. The staff was fantastic and prices were reasonable!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Back in AZ...missed the Mexican food down here. Enjoyed my favorite chicken flat as, rice & beans. Location is far out in the west valley and worth trying. Very casual, fordable price, and great costumer service."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food for decent prices.  Small location on a busy highway.  Great guacamole, home made chips and salsa"}
{"text":"Great little spot for lunch. Stopped in today with a buddy of mine and we left very impressed with not only the food but the service as well. We were greeted immediately upon entering and were checked on throughout our meal. The spot may be on the small side, but there was plenty of tables to sit comfortably. As for the food, the chips and salsa provided at the beginning were tasty. We all know chips and salsa set the tone and they hit the spot. For my meal I enjoyed a green burrito, cheese enchilada and rice. The burrito was great with tons of meat and a nice spice, the enchilada was very good, and the rice was okay. I must say, I think I have my new favorite Mexican food stop for the west valley. Support this hidden gem!!!!!"}
{"text":"drove by this place a hundred times, it looked like such a hole in the wall I didnt want to stop in and try it. Luckily I finally gave it a chance. Wow!!! This is a hidden gem, probably the best chili relleno I have ever had and great chips and salsa as well. The beans and rice were very good. Much better than any of the other mexican food around the area. Also very clean on the inside."}
{"text":"Oh MY what a find...Finally authentic, from scratch Mexican Food...Service is impeccable...very cl an...Perfect dinnerYum"}
{"text":"Hot, delicious Mexican food! Love this little joint !"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food I have had in Arizona yet! I've been here for almost 10 years now and tried many Mexican restaurants. There are several good ones, but not as wonderful as this one!
There was 5 in our party, every single one of us loved our food. The two ladies working were on the ball. Never forgot anything we asked them. They were friendly and very fast!
The chips were fresh, thin, and warm. The salsa is not chunky with just the right flavor and heat. We kept asking for refills and they brought them with no hesitation.
I had the chile rellenos and it was amazing. The serving was huge, the egg was cooked just right! Most places over cook them, not Tony's! The green sauce was perfect! The beans are flavorful and creamy. I could go on and on. We will all be back!"}
{"text":"Great little place in avondale family owned and cute . It's a little small and it was hot when I went but food was good"}
{"text":"Been going since I was little and continue to as an adult. Not for the nostalgia, but for the food! The beans, the enchiladas, the salsa.. Just go."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had, even living in AZ my entire life. The server was super sweet and attentive. We love it."}
{"text":"We had a party of eleven and every single meal we ordered was excellent! One of the best Mexican restaurants anywhere! Definitely going back for more. Service was second to none. 
You're missing out if you haven't been there."}
{"text":"My hubby likes to find local owned restaurants especially when it comes to Mexican food. He heard about Tony's on ABC 15 and decided we would give it a try.

The location is not the greatest in Old Avondale, and the building is tiny and shows its age. We ordered our meal as carry-out, I was in no shape to be seen in public so I didn't catch the inside. 

I had their carne asada combo plate which of course includes the staple beans and rice. The meat was seriously over cooked, and the beans and rice were bland. My husband makes way better carne asada, cooked to perfection. My husband had the tamale, cheese enchilada combo and he ate it up, mind you, it doesn't take much to please my Sailor Man when it comes to food. 

Overall I would compare it to a mom and pop version of Filibertos only not as good. It possibly could be better with a few beers. Maybe I will give them another spin...who knows."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot! Their dishes never disappoint and the servers are always awesome. We've been going for years. Their salsa is amazing, and made fresh daily. Fair prices and great food!"}
{"text":"My husband, our son and I had a nice dinner tonight, we love this restaurant. My husband likes burrito and I like chicken taco, their salsa is good. New waitress is very nice, great service."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try based on Yelp reviews. We will not be going back. Red and green burrito's are very bland. No flavor at all. As a matter of fact has a lot of flour added. Rice was mushy. Beans, tamale, taco, chips and salsa were ok. They only have a carne asada plate. No carne asada for tacos or burritos. Never heard of that before. Wow! That is just strange. They are very clean. That's was the only good thing."}
{"text":"The stars are for the excellent service and nice, clean location.  Plenty of seating when we arrived about a half hour after lunch time.  But I was not impressed with the food.  I'm not one who typically likes my food to be \"super hot/spicy\" or anything like that, but I do like flavor, and my flautas and tamale were quite noticeably bland.  In fact, the tamales I buy from the grocery store have a lot more flavor and the perfect amount of \"heat\".  My husband found his food to be bland as well.  This is a nice enough place, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place, and my wife and I figured we should check this out. What can I say about this mom and pop spot? Absolutely Fantastic! Overall great service, and great food! I ordered the Carne Asada Plate and you can taste the home cooked meal. We definitely will come back for another meal. Thanks Tony's Cafe! Authentic Mexican Cuisine! Yummy!"}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food pretty much ever. Chili relleno is the best ive ever had. Perfect enchiladas and delicious rice and beans. One down fall, i dont really like there tacos so i sub an enchilda for the taco on the number 3. Also best cheese crisp and i love there salsa!"}
{"text":"So I've never been here before, actually almost passed it as it's a small place. It's nothing fancy but very homey feel. I wanna say this is family owned but I'm not sure, the waitress we had, I have to say was the best waitress I've come across ever. She was so sweet, so attentive, and genuinely made you feel taken care of. The food, well I ordered the red chili it came with rice and beans. First let me say, this was just like home made cooking, I was pleasantly surprised. The beans were really good. I can't wait to come back and try more food!"}
{"text":"The chickens enchiladas were absolutely amazing!!!!!! Some of the best Mexican food I have had in a very long time.  I would totally recommend this place and if you want really good Mexican food this place is it!"}
