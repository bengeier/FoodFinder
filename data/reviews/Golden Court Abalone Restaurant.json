{"text":"The dim sum is great. Authentic and tasty. They have typical dishes like hargow and shu mai, but also ones I've never tasted before like fried octopus legs and curry cuttlefish. All the dishes that came out were steaming hot.  
I loved the dessert with sticky rice around sesame seed. It came out fresh and hot. I only wish we had ordered it later in the meal, because it was one of the first dishes to come out.
The service isn't great, but it's what I expect for a dim sum place."}
{"text":"This place gets VERY busy during lunch hours on the weekend! I came here last weekend and the lineup was practically out the door. Because we were really craving dim sum, we decided to wait it out.  I went to the podium and got a number and waited for our turn to get a table. The hostess had a tendency of calling out the numbers in Chinese but as we did not speak the language, we had to keep reminding her to say it out in English as well - afraid we would lose our turn if we didn't claim our number when it was called. The wait was about 40 minutes when we finally got a seat. Food was good and inexpensive compared to some other dim sum restaurants I've been to before. Good value for your money! We ordered siu Mai , chicken feet, meat and veggies wrapped in a bean curd sheet, spare ribs, bbq pork buns, tofu and eggplant and sticky rice .. No complaints about any of it! My favourite dish was the meat and veggies wrapped in bean curd sheets (pic posted). As the poster before me stated, be careful when accepting dishes from the floor walkers - they can be costly and don't look the freshest."}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum places in GTA.

It used to be so packed here that you sometimes had to wait outside, but it has since slowed down a bit.  Still need to wait sometimes on the weekends.

Hope you can read chinese, because on the back of the dim sum mark sheet they have some noodle and rice dishes for special."}
{"text":"My grandpa really loves this place, when ever he comes back from China he would always go there to eat. There are a lot of variety of food, the lunch fried dishes are really big. 

Their service is really good, they remember my grandpa and we would get discount which is really good. 

The food comes out pretty fast I guess"}
{"text":"I haven't been to dim sum here in years and remembered it to be very good. Came here recently with my family and disappointed that the food has gone downhill. The dishes are hit and miss. What were excellent items were the chicken feet and octopus. Har gow and shumai were so so. The beef ball was awful and had a very bad after taste that made me want us want to gag. The egg tart while delicious were too buttery in flavour. Tripe was underdone. Rice noodle rolls were good though. We won't come back unless he only thing we eat are chicken feet and fried octopus."}
{"text":"Waiting time is OK (not as crazy as Fancy), food is alright (better than most places in uptown).  However, they need to work on the cleanliness (this place is perceptively grand but slightly dated and dirty if you look closely - staff should really wash their hands before handing out the teapots).   Biggest turn-off:  I found a small piece of shattered glass in one of the steamed meatballs.  Overall, it's an alright dim sum place when you want to avoid huge line ups in other places)"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.

I went there for the dinner menu. Had the Peking duck, it was was like they dipped it in hot oil before they served it. It was greasy and there were three pieces of green onion, cut the size of half a finger length. Pretty stingy. Waited half an hour before receiving it.
 
Continuing with the rest of dinner, after our first course of Peking duck, we waited half an hour for another course. They finally brought out the squab a half hour later. What annoyed us was that the manager saw us annoyed with the wait time, yet stated \"food will be there soon.\" I don't want to be told there will be food, I want to see food. We were waiting an hour before the actual meal arrived. We had the BBQ pork fried rice, pea greens sautéed in garlic, beef in black pepper sauce, general \"Tao\" chicken, \"wok fried\" oyster in honey pepper sauce, and \"braised noodle.\"

Lemme say this. DO NOT trust what the menus says. The fried rice, squab, and pea greens were fine, albeit the pea greens came at the END of our meal, and we had to order it twice before it came. 

The general Tao chicken. OH MY GOD. IT WAS AWFUL. You'd think its a crispy, sweet and spicy dish. Nope, it was god awful sour. It was YELLOW. That's not general Tao chicken. 

The beef in black pepper sauce was extreme,y over cooked and tough.

The \"wok fried\" oyster were deceiving. They were deep fried, and placed on this weird sweet bun, and drenched in honey. When it said wok fried, I assumed it would have been stir fried with veggies. No, it was some little tapas looking plate.

The \"braised\" noodles were DEEP fried. We told the manager this was not braised, and he said yeah this isn't deep fried, it was just fried. Oh god. The menu did not say it had mushrooms in it, but it had mushrooms. 

The service, two opinions. First, our first \"waitress\" who was actually the host, was a sweet lady who was kind. She helped us ordered and recommended us popular dishes. After that, she stopped serving us and served other tables, so the manager and another lady served us. The manager, although patient, was really confusing. We tried to tell him that we didn't order fried noodles but braised noodles, but he kept saying that in the menu that's what it was. There was a second server who was completely rude. Every time we asked her some something such as whether the noodle plate was correct, she acted like we were idiots and tried to tell us that that's what we ordered, and seemed like she wanted to pick a fight. Furthermore, she dropped a tea cup full of tea on one of our attendees.

Food, mediocre. Service, under average. I wouldn't recommend this for dinner. Maybe for dim sum, I've yet to experience it. Don't think I'll ever here though."}
{"text":"Came here to try it out. Dim sum was OK  I've had better. The sui mai was not good at all. Not many dishes. I also came for dinner. Had Peking duck which was Good. Same with the rice noodle with beef and veggie. It was nice that the waiter would serve it to you. It was not busy when we got there around 6ish but then it started to fill up quickly. It's okay food. I don't think I would came back for dim sum but I would come back for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a large restaurant in Richmond Hill ( Leslie & Hwy 7 area ) and has been here as far as I remember... This place can easily accomodate any sized party and play host for any type of function. A very banquet like facility, large expansive dining space, round tables, chandeliers, red carpets, and a raised platform in the centre for a host table. 

After perusing the menu, we came up with a whopping order of 10 dishes of various categories. Steamed, Steamed Rice, Deep Fried, Steamed Rice Roll, and Sweets. 

All the items we tried were very good. They were delivered to the table in a timely manner and arrived piping hot. 

Nothing to note that was out of worldly or bad. Golden Court is a solid choice for dim sum in the area."}
{"text":"Went here with a dozen of my buddies, honestly was going to hit up ambassador for dim sum. The change in plan was due to one of my buddies knowing the staff at golden court.

The Total Bill was just over $150! To be fair though we were able to consume somewhere in the range of 50+ dishes!

Loved the dishes, the selection of tea was great and tapped into my asian background =). Only dish that I would pass on was the char siu (BBQ pork) over priced for the quantity given.

3.5 Stars!"}
{"text":"After half an hour wait, we finally got seated.... Setting the table is like throwing dishes at us. What's worst is the dishes are extremely dirty, lip stick stains, left over tea leaves on the plates. Need I say more? It's just rinse with hot water. Not your typical dim sum places with the carts ."}
{"text":"Meal: dinner 
Pros: 
*good selection of food
*10% discount if paid by cash
*restaurant is not pack even when it's July 2nd.

Cons: 
*Service is quite poor: waitresses were yelling at each other across our table
*food was salty 
*even the vegetable was salty
* I know this is a Chinese restaurant but for a dinner, the restaurant was really loud"}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was pretty bad. We came during lunch for dim sum and the person at the front was all over the place. This place, like many other dim sum places, required you to take a number and wait for a table. We had to wait 10 to 15 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge us and give us a number and the place wasn't even that busy. Yet she still had the time to have friendly conversations with regular customers that she knew. The food was okay but not good enough to come again and go through this whole experience again."}
{"text":"I really like the dim sum and dinner here. They also have special items and rotate their dim sum every now and then.

My favourites are the durian puff pastry, siu mai with quail egg, rice rolls with fish paste in the middle, and salty egg custard steam buns. They also have the big deep fried sesame balls!

They are really good at cooking seafood (fresh and dried). If you're looking for something specific, they can order it for you. They cooked an Alaskan king crab for us a two years ago and it was probably the best we've ever had. They have the best selection of dried seafood in Canada as the owner is the wholesaler for dried seafood (ex. Abalone).

Their abalone chicken is very unique. They marinate the chicken in abalone sauce for many hours prior to serving. 

Prices are higher, but it is definitely worth it.

There are long waits on the weekends. Like many dim sum places, the hostess gives tables to loyal customers first, regardless of any reservations."}
{"text":"If you're not Chinese, don't expect decent service. It's hard to enjoy your overall experience when you've waited 1 hour just to cop a seat and then another 45 minutes to get your first piece of food. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem waiting an hour; HOWEVER, if I see people who came after me getting a seat before me, I'm not going to be pleased. Yes, I understand 2 people get seated before my party of 4 but I don't think this applies to parties of 6. Yeesh, they seat hour-early reservations of 10, 13 , 11, 12, etc., then let in the regulars, then Chinese-speaking guests and finally, the non-Chinese speakers. 

After all this, once I got enough food to get over my hanger... the food was mediocre. I don't think the prices are super expensive - they're on par with other dim sum places in Markham. Not the best food I've had, not the worst. But the overall experience was less than stellar."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 0 stars. The hostess will only attend to regulars. 7 groups of regulars just bypassed the line as non-regulars are stuck piling up. As us non-regulars are waiting, you can see empty tables left and right. The restaurant itself is honestly not even that busy for a weekend. For those wanting to try regardless, I advise you to come early or don't come at all. 

In the end, some credit goes to the kitchen staff for the quality of food (mind you, it's not amazing; ok quality)."}
{"text":"I was told to have dim sum here, but I never thought I'd make the trip.  I happen to run an errand in Richmond Hill one day and I happen to be in the same plaza as Golden Court Abalone Restaurant.  It was fate.

This is one of those places that doesn't have carts.  You simply order from the sheet.  So you'd better know your stuff.  

I was given full control of ordering, which was a bad idea.  I ordered my favourites: shrimp dumplings (har gow), stuffed peppers, banana leaf glutinous rice, spare ribs, steamed bbq pork buns, dumplings with peanuts, Chinese canneloni*

And then also ordered the infamous tofu, eggplant, shrimp dish.  Apparently, this dish isn't common.  I can attest to never seeing this offered at another restaurant before.

I wanted sesame balls for dessert.  We got the soft, gooey ones rather than the fried ones.  I should have just ordered verbally.  I can't handle these order sheets!

So I ordered a total of 9 dishes, of which many of them were considered \"large\" dishes.  Oh, did I mention there were only two of us?  So, you could say I over-ordered.  I would recommend approximately 3 dishes per person.  Although, we only had about 1 dish left over (combined leftovers of several dishes), we were both stuffed past the brim.

This appears to be a classier joint than what I'm used to.  They give you the communal chopsticks and all.  Décor is a tad on the fancy side.  

The only issue I had was the price.  I guess you get what you paid for, but I've had dim sum just as good for half the price.  It's definitely excellent quality, but I will need to save up if I'm going to come here again.

*I think there's another word for this - rice noodle wrap or something."}
{"text":"This one of the many chinese restaurants I frequent when I come to visit, about twice a year.  Their dim sum on the weekend is pretty good and pretty busy, lines can get long.  You can try to reserve a table but sometimes they will not let you, depends who you get on the line :-p.

All the dim sum is pretty good but one specialty dish that is \"super fantastic\" is the spicy seafood noodle soup.  You can get it extra spicy and you'll be sweating!"}
{"text":"Update - November 2016
Food is still good but some friendly service would be nice. Example \"Rita\" in her suite and attitude. Someone should train the team in service.

---------


A very decent dim sum restaurant in Richmond Hill; very much palatable with traditional selections. After a whole series of dim sum restaurants closing, we were very happy to find an alternative.

Recently updated inside, the restaurant has a fresh bright interior... And I think the service even got better. The food is consistently good and hot, and compared to other Chinese restaurants, the service is actually attentive. 

The restaurant caters well to both Chinese and non-Chinese speaking and has a very English friendly menu.

Enjoy! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times. The most recent visit was for a friends grandma's birthday. I found the experience and the food to just be average. 
Parking has improved in this plaza though since the wasabi ayce sushi restaurant closed down a couple months ago."}
{"text":"Still a fan!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and crispy when it was supposed to be. 

A little pricey but would recommend"}
{"text":"Hmmm... So I'm not the biggest fan of dim sum (yes, I know... Worst Asian ever!), but my grandparents are big fans of this place, so we go here a lot on some special occasions: ie mother's day!

ALWAYS super busy, with a rather small parking lot. Makes finding a parking spot for dim sum near impossible!

For the food, being allergic to crustaceans kinda limits the amount of food you can eat at dim sum (as everything has shrimp in it!). I personally love the Chrysanthemum Jellies they have for dessert though!

Pretty good service, but usually have to wait a long time to get a seat if you don't reserve ahead of time."}
{"text":"Love this place,  food was great,  service was excellent,  all servers were friendly and welcoming..."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant and it is our 'go-to' dim sum joint. It is clean, colourful and the food is quite good.

The staff are considerably nicer to you after a generous Chinese New Year... *wink* *wink*...

Prices are raised and now it's slowly falling out of favour. Still our favourite place for now, until we find somewhere more affordable but just as tasty."}
{"text":"This is the best dim sum we've had in North America. Recommended to us by a Chinese Canadian Toronto native who grew up in the Markham, this place is one of our highlights of our trip. 

We arrived at 1pm on a Monday (Boxing Day weekend) to a completely full restaurant. We waited for about 15 min to be seated. From there, we got a dim sum menu and checked off the items that we wanted.

They have plenty of classics but they do it BETTER. In dim sum restaurants of lower quality, I get sometimes sick from eating the highly glutinous meat wrappers or if it's way too oily. Here, everything was very refined AND prepared well. For example, the fried crueler in the rice wrapper was still crispy! How do they do it!

Some other favorites - the thousand year old egg congee (very \"xi\" - we think they blended it with chicken stock), the shumai with quail egg (very special), the shrimp dumplings, the sticky rice wrapped in bamboo (REALLY good flavor), pork ribs, etc. 

It was good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum places in Richmond Hill / Markham Hwy 7 corridor.  

Dim Sum Style -- you order from a dim sum menu, no push carts, which is what I prefer.  On weekends, additional items that are not on the menu will be brought out by the staff on trays; you pick what you like.

Quality and Selection -- all traditional items are there.  Quality has been fairly consistent and good, always fresh and every dim sum dish made-to-order.  Har Gaw (steamed shrimp dumplings), shrimp rice rolls, \"pineapple\" buns with BBQ pork filling, and siu mai (steamed pork dumplings) are all good.

Service -- nothing specially great or bad, befitting a place like this.

Keep this on the to-go list? -- YES"}
{"text":"Yet another Chinese restaurant for a standard peking duck dinner. I really can't say much more than that. It was fine, tasted good, but I can't say that anything was exceptional.

The lobster e-fu noodles was also just good. The 3lb lobster itself was fresh, juicy, and, well, everything you expect lobster to be. However, I found that the e-fu noodles could use a little more flavour. 

I had mixed feelings about the vegetable dish (dou miu). Some parts were cooked to a soft tenderness, while others were still really tough and chewy.

Ah, and on a \"good night\", you may be lucky enough to clash with an external group function and get to enjoy your dinner conversations by screaming over oldies' Chinese karaoke! And if you're SUPER lucky, there may actually even be decent singers..! :P"}
{"text":"One of our go to Chinese restaurants in the area. The quality is always consistent and very tasty. 

This restaurant is definitely on the higher end of the spectrum, more expensive than other Chinese  restaurants. You get what you pay for, and will never go away with a bad meal. Has dinner service as well as dim sum. The have set menus as well as a la carte for dinner, and dim sum is via order sheets instead of push carts.

It does get busy for dim sum so either come early or come with someone who is a regular. They take reservations for dinner and on weekends some part of the restaurant is usually booked for weddings, birthdays or something so seating capacity may be limited

As for the food, doesn't really matter what you order, the food will be good!

4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Decent place for dimsum.  We go there at times with colleagues.  Not too busy and the prices are ok."}
{"text":"You know you're in Richmond Hill when you dim sum dishes costs $3 for S, $4 for M, $5 for L and $6 for an XL. But you get what you pay for, you get a upscale dim sum experience with fancy decor and elevated dishes full of flavour. I was surprised how busy it was on a Friday for lunch but I could see why after how delicious the food was. Tasty and the dishes were pretty big! Service was above average considering it was a Chinese restaurant. Our total bill was $40 with tax and tips for 6 dishes so pretty expensive...that's the only reason why this resto deserves one star less."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner so cant comment on the dimsum. There was an event held there to celebrate a babys' 100th day so was very loud. That didnt deter from the flavourful food.

All the dishes we tried were pretty good. They even made the mussels dish light on fire. It's all for the effect as it was fully cooked already.

I highly recommend the \"salted duck egg battered fried squid/shrimp/scallop\" dish. It's the first time I've seen it being offered at any chinese restaurant. Probably very high in cholesteral but it's just so good.

Flavours are good. Prices are a bit higher than the normal cantonese restaurant."}

Imagine... if this place was carting. It would be dimsum madness.
Glad they make-to-order so I don't feel breezy behind my back.
It would literally be diner-dash instead of server-dash.

Nothing outstanding memorable. I'm trying to remember now... Nope.
Maybe that's a beneficial acknowledgement of sorts. 
For better or for worse. I cannot not see myself back there again.

{"text":"One of my Aunt's favorite places.  We came here for the King Crab dinner, it is really good.  We also ordered Peking Duck and other dishes.  The King Crab was cooked three way, it was super delicious.  Even the Crab Shell fried rice was tasty, I don't usually go for the wet fried rice.  The steamed legged was good but the battered body meat were also cook beautifully.  We couldn't decide which is better, everyone have their favorite, but they both were great."}
{"text":"I like getting a great deal for what I pay. This place has good food, but the prices seem a tad high given the quality of the food I'm getting.

Had:
Steamed rice noodle roll with dough fritters (M) - small portion. The rice noodle roll did have small dried shrimps and chives in it, but the dough fritters weren't crispy enough.
Phoenix claw (S) - Chicken feet in a sweet/savory/mildly spicy sauce. Delicious.
Braised duck feet with turnip (M) - good, but it wasn't turnip. It was some kind of savory Chinese melon.
Bean curd sheet with chicken and fish maw (L) - Delicious, but expensive.
Pancake with Chinese sausage, chives, and turnip? (L) - crispy on one side. Needed to be crispy on both. Still good though. Decent portion for price...kinda...
Bean sheet roll with veggies inside (S?M? I can't remember) - tasty, but once again, not cheap.
Steamed dumpling with king oyster mushroom and baby veggies inside (L) - 3 dumplings to an order. Good sized dumpling, but for what was inside, quite expensive. I believe the baby veggies were bok choy. One of the highlights of my meal.
Spare ribs (S?M? I also can't remember) - taro cubes as filler on the bottom. Spare ribs were not as tender as I'd like. They also weren't evenly cut. I had this really big piece that was made of like 4 smaller connected pieces. Not cool.

Service: Fairly good, but they forgot our order twice (once for Chinese mustard, and once for getting boxes). That second time was slightly irritating. We had to ask again, and the lady who we asked for boxes said, \"Of course we can get you boxes\" in a fairly condescending tone. We then told her the first server had forgotten and she apologized. Still, not cool.

Lots of people for lunch, even on a weekday. We went at 2pm and they had almost a full house. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Great dim sum - everything came out hot and quick.  Decent service and prices are reasonable for the area (Small dish is $2.40 for instance).  We came on boxing day and surprised there was no wait at prime time (12pm) for dim sum.

Highly recommend the deep fried octopus tentacles, siu mai, har gar, e-mein, spare ribs.  Overall a solid dim sum choice for experience and beginner dim-summers...!"}
{"text":"I came to Golden Court a few times before. The food is decent and service could be better. The staff seem to shout at each other a lot. We had to wait about 5 minutes to actually get seated while we watch the servers clean off the tables. However, service seemed to improve a bit more once we were seated and the food actually came out pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend getting the sweet custard buns! Overall, not my first choice when it comes to dim sum restaurants but it's an okay place to get food if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"The service is good, the interior is pretty, the dishes are clean, and the dim sum is fresh. However most dishes lacked flavor. But they may be catering to the older population so foods are less salty. So I guess it's healthy?The only thing I liked was the almond bun. The filling was warm with a strong almond taste. It wasnt too sweet either. You can come to this place at 11 am without lining up. There are no morning specials."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place. I hate places that scam your money. The staff here are selfish and it's amazing what they would do to make u pay for extras. Upon arriving we were greeted warmly and was served a small plate of chow mein and hotsauce/mustard. We didn't order it but the staff was speaking so warmly with my bf's parents, saying how she was saving the last plate for them, that I really couldn't oppose. The food is good and they come out at good timing. The prices are based on various sizes with the large size, being most of it dishes, priced at $5. We order 7 things and the bill
Came up to $55. What was annoying was how we were charged 0.80 pp for sauces when we were only \"given\" one. The chow mein also came up to $8.50. Geez...Be aware of ordering stuff that comes around and make sure u load up on the sauces if you order it!"}
{"text":"I have to honestly said I am very impressed with this restaurant! (They don't just serve Abalones!) I had no expectation as I only tried dim sum once but never tried them for dinner before.  I  thought it would be on the pricier side but it turns out it was reasonably priced.  We were a huge group of 20+ people that went there for dinner to celebrate two bdays. We ended up paying $40 per person for 10+ courses meal. The cost also covered the two birthday people share :)  


The restaurant put us in a private room on the right hand side with two tables. Even though there was a huge charity singing event occuring in the main room, we were well isolated from the sound. It was a good setting for our big group for such occasion, with the service being very professional and courteous. The waitress Was very friendly and even set the dishes for me so that I can take nice pictures for social media hahaha. 

I strongly recommend anyone to try them out for dinner if you are looking for good Chinese dishes or if u have family members or friends that are pickey.  all dishes were high quality and tasty. I cannot wait bring my out of town family when they come visit from Montreal as they always looking for good Chinese food and it is quite rare to find good Chinese food in Montreal lol

{"text":"One of my favourite go-to dimsum places in Toronto (north of the city in Markham). It's usually quite busy during lunch hours, especially on weekends.

Their prices are fair, and they have unique items that no other dim sum restaurants have, like my ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE \"Lau Sa Almond Buns\". If you are a fan of Almond Croissants (or anything Almond flavoured), Salty Egg Yolk Custard Buns \"Lau Sa Bao\", and traditional Crispy Topping Buns \"Muk Sai Gor Bao\" from Chinese Bakeries, you will absolutely love this dish, and want to order a few extra buns to go, as they often sell out from the dimsum rush.

If you go for dinner, another great must-try dish is their pan-fried scallops topped with truffle sauce, served with broccoli. You get around 10 scallops for $22, which is an amazing deal. And they even cook it tableside in front of you!"}
{"text":"Just to let you guys know if you are planning to come here as a couple this restaurant wont serve table for 2 even thought there is plenty of empty table available. i was there today and they make me wait a few minute and ask their colleague to see if they want to serve table for 2 but they said no and i was really disappointed."}
{"text":"As sad as I am to not be living in downtown anymore, places like Golden Court make me so happy to be living in Markham. Finally some good, authentic (hah as if I would know), tasty Dim Sum!!

We were a big group of 10 and ordered nearly half the menu to try and I can honestly say there was not ONE dish that didn't like. Service was quick and they were very attentive. There was only one dish outstanding which was taking a while but we were able to cancel it with no problems. After splitting the bill, it came to just over $10 / person (yes this was for lunch too so it was supposed to be expensive) and for the amount of food we ate, there definitely was not a better deal.

The only \"part\" issue was that they charged us nearly $8 for tea! I think it's a flat rate for large groups and although we got around 4 or 5 tea pots worth, it still seemed a bit hefty.

**Note On Tea: At Golden Court they bring you a SUPER concentrated tea pot which is so bitter it's nearly undrinkable and then they bring you a large flask of hot water. Simply mix together and enjoy! We made the mistake of spending half our lunch trying to down the tea by itself wondering why it was so bitter.

Either way, great great place and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was here for dim sum around lunch time...we got here around 11am.  My friend comes here frequently so the staff were particularly accommodating.

It's child friendly.  Well, technically it's loud, so it's easy to bring kids since it's loud anyway.  They have high chairs and can easily accommodate strollers.

We ordered the typically fare...sui mai, cha sui bao.  It was tasty.  

They have a menu where you tick off boxes and they bring the dishes to you, rather than having the carts that drive around.  I kind of like the carts myself, just for the novelty of it.  But it was still good.

The sign outside is loud and obnoxious.  The interior is a bit more refined.  It would be nice if they changed the sign to reflect the interior, but I guess that's not something that concerns them."}
{"text":"A relatively nice place to eat.  Food is alright and I have been here before for dim sum and it is not too bad either.  A lot of events are held here with weddings and banquets from time to time.  Price range is relatively good as well (though yes, you could find cheaper), but honestly, it really is not as bad as other have mentioned though I definitely would not rate it the way above average, it does satisfy the craving for dim sum if one does choose.  Also, their set menu, which I have had the pleasure of trying consistently due to a lot of my meetings and events here is decent.  Overall, a pretty nice place to have your craving for Chinese set course meals and/or dim sum and I do recommend for people who love Chinese food to at least relatively consider this restaurant as one of the places to go when you are in Markham.

They have a private meeting room on the side, so if you want a space that is a bit more quiet with a bit more functionality for events or seminars, you can definitely host one there."}
{"text":"At first when I arrived I was kinda skeptical since the head chef had decided to go elsewhere and half the staff had moved on. I hadn't really been here for a couple weeks so I was in for a surprise. 

Oh, also... I don't really know the translations for a lot of the stuff so bear with my Chinese translations I may get kinda creative.

First thing, there was a banquet in the restaurant so I would expect the food to be a bit better. 

Whenever there's a banquet in the same restaurant, order the sucking pig. You're guaranteed a good fresh pig because they would have brought new ones in. The one we had was excellent. Crunchy thin skin with lots of meat; Perfect.  

Next we had a steamed chicken. It was alright. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was a little bland. Otherwise it was nice and moist. 

I still believe that this place makes a really good seafood tofu hotpot. I'm a big fan of tofu and they make it pretty good here.  The pot is filled with clean pieces of seafood and fresh fish (I really hate it when they use cheap veiny shrimp... HATE IT).  Only thing I would change is maybe out bigger chunks of tofu in it. 

Last thing I noticed they changed is their lychee jello things (I have no idea what they're called but apparently they're on the dim sum menu). Instead of little dried fruit things they used to put in (which I hated) they now have replaced it with flowers and pollen; a very plesent change. Definately try it at dim sum if you have a chance. Tastes like flowers."}
{"text":"This is a private party. The food is pretty good. The service is very good because we know the waitress. But what really turn me off is after j sat down. The fork, glass, cup were dirty. Some of the plate are chipped. A restaurant line this they should consider to correct these things."}
{"text":"I would consider this an authentic dim sum place with overall good food. The \"Har Gow\" (#3) is made of Tiger prawn, and is very well done."}
{"text":"This place is nice, we went with our family who pointed out how much more expensive this place is for dim sum compared to other places we go to and service is very slow."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum restaurants I've been too.  Definitely get the shumai with quail eggs, and beef tendon!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced dim sum. Came here on a Saturday around 11 and it wasn't crazy packed. 

Personally I rather pay a bit more to enjoy myself, not feel rushed, and not be waiting an hour to eat. This place was quite pleasant given it didnt get packed until a bit later around noon

Food was tasty and came out fast and furious and hot"}
{"text":"Markham has a wide variety of dim sum options available, some of which serve very traditional dishes, others which serve more modern and fusion options. Golden Court leans towards the former, although the restaurant utilizes ordering by checking items off a menu, as opposed to picking items off of carts which was more common in Hong Kong a few decades ago.

The food is definitely top quality as far as dim sum restaurants go. I was able to try the siu mai with quail egg, which I've never had before, and it was quite tasty. The curry squid and pork intestines were also very fresh and very tasty - squid in particular can sometimes be way too rubbery, but it was just right at Golden Court. My favorite items to get were the eggplant with shrimp paste on top (the eggplant was just amazing) and the steamed fish maw and chicken wrapped with bean curd sheet - this latter item has so many different things inside of it, and all the flavors blend together nicely to create a beautiful harmony.

With such a wide variety of options at Golden Court, it's worth going back several times to try all the items on their menu. The quality is on point here."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends last time. It is usually good so I'm not sure what happened. We came on a weekend during yum cha hours where they push carts and should have everything ready. Their siu mai is pork and shrimp and it was raw. We sent it back and they gave us another one... which was also raw. We went it back AGAIN, and it came back AGAIN RAW. You can't serve raw pork to ur customers. Luckily my friend checked it because I'm sure most people don't and just eat it and get food poisoning later. The jelly fish we ordered , they Gave us the end of jelly fish which was hard and not edible. We complained and asked them for a new dish but they refused to give us a new jelly fish order. I would give it 2 stars because all my other experiences were great except this one but honestly, giving it one star only because the siu mai came back raw 3 times and that's just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great food. Extremely slow service. Got to dim sum early around 10 was quickly seated. 

The first few dishes took about 30 minutes to arrive and arrived in short bursts. We'd get three dishes wait 10 min, three more would come another 10 min. 

The food tasted great, all fresh. Just disappointed in the amount of time the food took. 

We left around noon. It took a full 2 hours from sit down to leaving."}
{"text":"Legit 3.5 star Chinese restaurant. Dim sum place in the morning and restaurant by night type of Chinese place. 

Been here many many times, kitchen is legit, service is good, decide and ambience is suited for typical family dinner with the relatives or friends.

Price is a bit more then average, but the price tag suits a business that has been long standing with many loyal customers.

This place does many banquets, weddings, birthdays, and Chinese \"full moon\" celebrations.

Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I'd have to day, this place is not as good as when it first open, but still a head above other restaurants. It stayed away from creating ridiculous variation of dim sum, and not waste money (or charge more) on \"presentation\". They still sell themselves on just having good old dim sum.
For dinner, it has good selection of dishes, and reasonable price. The down side to coming here for dinner in the weekend is to call ahead to make sure it is not \"closed\" for banquet."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is something difficult to review, there are simply too many dishes to cover with the limited space allotted. In addition, you will never find the perfect Dim Sum place, simply because the likelihood of one restaurant perfecting all your favourite dishes will be nil. As such is the case, I will focus more on the venue, and then just list the dishes via star rating groups.

The decor is more upscale than most dim sum places with real linen. The setting is a full one you would expect for dinner and the place is themed in gold. Inexpensive chandeliers hang from the ceilings and linen chair covers help guise the ordinary chairs. And all this is rolled into the prices of you meal. Despite these higher prices, the place is always packed after 11:30.

5 stars (must try):
#26. Steamed Oatmeal Custard Bun. Not sure why they translated it to oatmeal custard as there's no taste of oatmeal at all in the filling, perhaps in texture, or maybe in the bun? The literal translation is Runny Sand Bun which is much more appropriately metaphoric as the texture is a little grainy. The filling is butter, sugar, and preserved egg yolk (the true source of the graininess), and it's absolutely delish!
#37. Deep Fried Short Ribs Korean style.

4 Stars (Dim Sum Staples):
#3. Tiger Shrimp Dumpling. Good size shrimp (31-40 ct) with next to no fillers.
#5. Steamed Pork Dumpling (Shiu Mai). Juicy and Flavourful.
#10. Shiu Mai with Quail Egg. Not many places serve with quail egg.
#24. Salted Egg Yolk with Lotus Seed Paste Bun.
#38. Crispy Bean Curd Roll with Shrimps.
#40. Deep Fried Shrimp Pastry with Salad Sauce. Really deep fried shrimp wontons with mayo.
#60. Puffy Egg Tart. Different from the bakery, flakier and better!
#63. Steam Double Layer Milk with Ginger. Sweet like pudding.

3 Stars (If you still have room...):
#17. Steamed Spare Ribs in Black Bean Sauce. Warning: a little on the fatty side.
#22. Steamed Mni Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf. This is normally in the 4 star category, however in this instance the leaves were not cleaned! Flavour is good and the filling is one of the best. I normally rate this 4,5 stars because they're on the small size, but the uncleaned leaves is a hard one to let go (-1,5 stars).
#23. Steamed BBQ Pork Bun. Again, different from the bakery which is baked.
#42. Pan Seared Thin Pancake w/ Minced Pork & Green Onion.
#45. Pan Fried Turnip Cake w/ Shredded Dried Scallop.

2 Stars (Gambles... feeling lucky?):
#32. Deep Fried Octopus tentacles. This one is really squid tentacles and normally 3 stars, but this time around it lacked flavour evenly across the dish and some pieces were more tasty than others.
#52. Steamed Rice Roll w/ Shrimp and Green Onion. This one is also normally 3,5 stars, but they have now added celery! overpowering the subtlety of the dish (-1,5 stars).

1 Star (Some like it a lot, I like it not!):
#18. Steamed Pork Stomach w/ Sweet Sour Chinese Cabbage.
#34. Golden Fried Shrimp Balls filled with Diced Cheese.

For the more Adventurous Appetites:
#7. Steamed Fish Maw & Chicken Wrapped in Bean Curd Sheet. 3 stars.
#11. Steamed Cuttlefish in Curry Sauce. 3 stars.
#16. Steamed Chicken Feet in Chu-Hau Sauce. 3 stars.
#21. Beef Tripe with Ginger and Green Onion. Good flavour. Tender. Not too thick. 4 stars.
#65. Crispy Fried Durian Puff Pastries. Pastry a tad on the thick side. 3 stars.

Like every dim sum place, some dishes are great and some not so much.
The restaurants 4 star rating (3,5 star rating rounded up) is based on the ratio of good (4 & 5 stars) vs bad (1 & 2 stars) dishes they serve.
You'll just have to weigh out your cravings of specific dishes and then pick the Restaurant that will satisfy most of them.

{"text":"Old School restaurants like Golden Court seems to always deliver, despite the place being packed on a late Saturday afternoon, the Dim Sum was still served steaming fresh and full of good flavoring that does not leave one feeling bloated afterwards.  For some reason, I still enjoyed it best in 2004 when they had a different kitchen crew.  All in all, it is still a great authentic Cantonese restaurant that knows how to deliver a great experience."}
{"text":"A good place for dim sum. All the dim sums are made to order and all fresh and tasty! I prefer the made to order VS the pushing carts!

I love their seafood soup dumpling, they bring out a little burner to keep the content hot!

Golden Court does get busy on weekends with a long wait for tables.

They accepts Visa and Mastercard!"}
{"text":"My family's favourite and go to place for dim sum and big family dinners. For dim sum, their rice noodles are very smooth and perfectly steamed so that they aren't soggy but soft in the same time. Another favourite dish of mine is their BBQ-pork Mellon buns. This isn't on their menu so you'll have to either ask the waiters or wait until they bring some around asking if you want any. 

Their dinner menu has a vast range of options. Most of the dishes are not cheap but comes in very large portions. I highly recommend coming as a group of 4+ for dinner and ordering \"fish tail\" (sorry, don't know what's it's called in English)"}
{"text":"I've been to Golden Court a few times for dim sum (get there BEFORE 10:30am or risk a big line-up!) and tonight for the first time I went for dinner. The service is always great, the food is served quick and our requests are always accommodated, maybe because one of our friends is Asian, and is a regular, oh and has a cute baby, the waitresses can't get enough of the baby! I don't know that I'd attempt this place by myself as my Cantonese is pretty limited... Everything we had from the Peking Duck to the Chrysanthemum Jelly dessert was tasty."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!?

Of course the abalone! I haven't been here for lunch, but I heard the dim sum here are decent too. The shark fin soup is also very delicious as it's heated up at your table! Their seafood options are great here too. Depending on the season, you can get the Alaskan king crab, big lobsters or jumbo live shrimp. All very good!

The abalone usually comes with duck feet so if you're not a fan of duck feet, let them know to substitute it with something else. 

I had the quail too. It was alright. I didn't think it was crispy enough and didn't have much flavor. Make sure you dip it in the worcheshire sauce and the mixed salts for a better taste. 

The jumbo shrimp was fresh and very juicy. This is a seasonal seafood so ask if they have it available. There was lots of meat in each of the shrimp. Usually boiled and you'll need to dip into their soy sauce in order to enjoy this dish. 

LAST TIP?!

They only take cash or debit so make sure you come prepared! I suggest you take a look at the combo dinners to see if anything excites you. Always ask what kind of seasonal seafood they have in store and whether they have any specials going on."}
{"text":"Food was good but decor can use some updating.  I believe I was here over ten years ago back in its glory days and they haven't updated the restaurant since."}
{"text":"Largish dim sum hall at the Jubilee Square strip mall, bright yellow interior and comfortable.  We came on for dim sum at mid-day on a  Thursday.  Dim sum was served made to order: we got a paper menu and pencil, and checked off everything we wanted to eat.  

The best was the shiu mai: large, succulent pork dumplings topped with a crisp shrimp.  Also good were the baby bok choy with garlic, steamed chive and pork dumpling, another type of dumpling, har kow, and glistening shrimp rolls with scallions.  So-so were the stuffed deep fried eggplants, which were over-fried and under-stuffed.

Overall, haven't tried enough to give a better rating, and not everything wow'ed, but it seems a pretty solid choice for dim sum."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for years and decided to revisit. No wait time at 10:15am on a saturday morning... that's pretty awesome. The food was piping hot, fresh, and prompt. The bbq pork bao was meaty and balanced. I also had the rice roll with dough fritter inside. It was good except my preference is to have no mini dried shrimp on the outside. The staple har gow (shrimp dumpling) and sui mai (pork dumpling) were pretty good! Sui mai tasted particularly awesome, no condiments needed. The fried tentacles were aight, nothing special. Last but not least, service was pretty okay (for a Chinese restaurant). Yup, would return again and recommend to family/friends."}
