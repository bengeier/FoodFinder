{"text":"I love this place! we have ordered  take-out from here about 3 times and the food gets better and better. We've had the green veggie curry and the chicken pad thai. The flavours are great and everything is so fresh and tasty. One thing is that twice I've tried asking the person taking our order over the phone if they have thai rice paper rolls and the person didn't know what I was talking about. A bit disappointing (maybe it was a new employee?) but other than that, we've been completely satisfied with our orders from here. Most importantly, I am so happy to have a new place like this open in the area! Will definitely come here every few weeks!"}
{"text":"Had delivery yesterday and was pleasantly surprised, a great new addition to the neighborhood!  Veggies were fresh, not skimpy on meat portions and excellent taste on sauces/curries, need I say more? 

Ok to add a little more detail, had the spring rolls, green curry, red curry, pad Thai, and mango salad. Everything was decent and good. I will be eating here again, next time hopefully trying dining in!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened and I must say, their PAD THAI is AMAZING. 

I've had pad Thai in Thailand, Suko Thai (Toronto) Kao San Rd etc, and this place is definitely on Par, if not better. Even better, it was only $10! 

Give this resto a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"From the outside Thai Culture looks like an uninviting hole in the wall but once you are inside, it looks spacious, clean and has a comfy atmosphere.

I ordered the Beef Pad Thai and 1lb deep fried chicken wings. Their pad Thai was good and had decent flavour but I order the beef version and some how I ended up getting chicken which was fine.  Now the chicken wings on the other hand was horrific, so burnt, way way way over cooked, the most burnt and dry chicken wings I ever had.

I'll come back again and tried the rest of the menu, but definitely avoiding the chicken wings."}

{"text":"This is not Thai food. The coconut sweet rice & mango made me really sad because it was just awful.  It is my favorite Thai dessert and this place just botched it up.

Pad Thai was clumpy and too saucy.  This is some weird Asian food that looks a little like Thai food and tastes like frozen food. Not good at all. Was really looking forward to delicious Thai take-out today. Sigh."}
{"text":"Really delicious curry pad thai - full of flavour and generous amount of sauce (and vegetables if you order the veggie option). The \"date night\" combo is great value: you get spring rolls and an order of thai red curry and pad thai for a very reasonable price and authentic quality. The restaurant is relatively new and is still a bit quiet so it may not be your thing if you're looking for a happening restaurant."}
{"text":"Totally decent Thai food in the neighborhood.   

No one died and everything was as good as, or better than was advertised.  

Clean, quick and flavorful.    Rice noodles without regret.    Curry without concern.   Pad thai without penicillin. 

Our taking baby steps did not allow us to sample any of their excellent sounding Malaysian dishes.    Perhaps next time.  

Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Im going to preface this review with: Thai food is by far my favorite food I have even traveled to Thailand to eat it. I have tried over 30 thai restaurants in Toronto in the last 17 years and this is one of the top 3 thai restaurants in terms of food and the #1 thai rest in terms of service. 

FOOD: I had the malay curry and it was out of this world! the best one I had so far, I had great ones before but this one had a little something different a lot more flavor, was kinda unique in a way and i loved it!!! I also ordered some green tea and again it was the perfect green tea temp not too hot as most restaurants don't know your not supposed to serve green tea with boiling water (it burns the leaves and makes the tea taste bitter)

SERVICE: WOW!! classy all the way, first of all the wait staff are so well trained in five star quality service I was surprised they don't charge more for the food. when the wait staff approaches your table they stand aside not too close but close enough for you to know they are awaiting your gaze so they don't interrupt your meal, once you acknowledge them they speak..that is the way its supposed to be in every restaurant but so very few get it right. 

Atmosphere:  It's a cosy quiet little place with a great calm and zen like energy (great for reading a book or a date). the kitchen is located in the front of the restaurants and its partially open to the dining area which usually means you can hear the hustle and bustle of the kitchen...but there was barely any noise I don't know how they do it but i did notice that the staff speak softly to each other and while they take orders on the phone.

The bad stuff: its very hard to find them online, I had tried many times to order take out and they didn't come up and I have been calling the phone number i found 647-348-8424 for over an hour and all i get is a busy signal (they could be closed for family day but there should be voice mail not a busy signal)..not sure if the wrong number is posted but from a marketing perspective thats horrible your customers should be able to find you online very quickly and should be able to call easily so hopefully they fix those issues soon as i think they are new and i really hope they stay for good."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and were excited to try this place when it opened. The Malay Curry Tofu with Vegetables was one of the best curries I've had. It was quite spicy and the portion was generous. They had lots of other vegetarian options. My partner had the Beef Devil and said it was also quite good."}
