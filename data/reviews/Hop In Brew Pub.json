{"text":"I'm such a fan of this pub. Firstly, it's adorable. Nothing feels more like home than walking into a tiny little character house for a pint. I like that they serve relatively local brews. 

It's kind of a mixed crowd. I like it mostly when it's empty. You can sit on the deck upstairs - or play some pool. Very relaxed atmosphere. 

Also - the nachos are SUPER great. Add chicken on top of them and they are DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"The Hop In Brew is is perhaps the only bar in Calgary with curb appeal: a yellow house, surrounded by a white picket fence and often overflowing with happy (or least, pleasantly calm) patrons. Crossing from the city sidewalk into the front yard you feel as if you've stumbled across a cool, but low-key house party in the middle of the suburbs. The main floor is as small as it is cozy, with old wood floors, a stairway that belongs in an old farm house, and calming, earthy tones throughout. Other than the balcony - which you'll have trouble procuring unless you come early - the 2nd story is far less interesting and not much different than your typical low-rent city bar.

If you can find a seat, you'll need to save it somehow and order from the bar.  The minimally renovated kitchen means your food options ($$) are limited (nachos or pizza - both of which good, not great) and potentially time intensive (expect at least a 45 minute wait if the bar is remotely full). The beer selection is excellent but glasses of their craft varieties (including their house beer) are typically more than $8 each. The cost is offset partly by the higher alcohol content, but unless you're an expert at nursing a beer, it is difficult to enjoy an evening of any appreciable length without ruining your wallet. As long as you're in it for unique beer in a unique place, it might just be worth it."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and AMAZING pizza. I loved the vibe! Will be back..many many times!"}
{"text":"Compared to the handful of other beer bars I visited while in Calgary, Hop in Brew Pub definitely offered a decent selection in a relaxed, friendly environment. A far cry from the ridiculous posturing over at Craft Beer Market, the staff are approachable and friendly. The menu is limited to pizza's and bar appetizer items but if you are looking for some great, reasonably priced beers, check it out!"}
{"text":"I used to love the hop-in-brew, but I have to say I was a little disappointed when I ordered the nachos on my last visit.  They were $13 and it was seriously just a plate of tortilla chips with cheese melted over top.  It was exactly the same thing I would make for myself when I was a lazy teenager.   Although it was a large portion it was totally not worth the the price.   

Everything else there is great though: the music, the atmosphere, the people-watching, etc."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - casual, laid back.  Fabulous Pizza!"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm being slightly generous with 3 stars.  The house is Absolutley.... Gross.  The bench seat cushions look extremely dirty and the worst part of all: it literally stinks like a seniors complex full of dirty depends.  If my wife and I weren't completely starving then we would have left.

We ordered the pizza which was recommended by the waitress. It tasted like a frozen pizza. Crust was far from fresh. Overall, a bad experience.  I'm changing it to 2 stars after writing this."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome. An old house converted to a bar you get the \"come as you are\" vibe. You don't come here to watch  sports on tv because they don't have any. They cater to those of us who simply want to have a beer and visit with friends, maybe even shoot a game of pool or play fuse ball. I've never seen any wait staff here which is kind of refreshing. They have one bar on the main level and if you'd like another drink they're happy to pour you one. It's like a home away from home."}
{"text":"Yup, I am a fan of the Hop in Brew!  I've been going on and off since moving to Calgary years ago and I miss it when I let too much time go by.  It's the perfect small pub for meeting up with friends when you are in a mellow but chatty mood.  As has been mentioned about the music - it's good but not overwhelmingly loud.  

My only complaint would be the hours - perhaps this is because I work within walking distance and would love to go with work pals for lunch!  But alas, it only opens early evening-ish...   

But hey, I don't want to knock it because there is a great vibe, great beer, & some of the best nachos I've had in Calgary, it's a classic in my books!"}
{"text":"Hop In Brew is probably my favorite pub.  It's in an old house and they have an amazing selection of beer.

I came here on my second date with my wife and she had a blast beating the crap out of me at foosball.  I've been here with a group of dudes and it was a great time too.

It's an amazing atmosphere and I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"I really thought this place would be more charming considering it's a bar in an old house! I guess I didn't really get a good look around but went in for a few drinks. The drinks were very basic. Decent beer selection. Felt like a bit of a frat house pub, clientele included but if that's your vibe you'd like it."}
{"text":"So much fun here! Hop N Brew makes me feel like I'm hanging out in an old frat house and it gives such good vibes. Downstairs there is seating and the bar, and the upstairs has a pool table and more seating! I have spent countless hours at the pool table meeting great people! I can't say I've had the food, but the bartenders are so easy to talk to and they were more than open to my song requests if their iPods happened to have them. It's a great place year round, and even better in the warmer weather with the little patio upstairs :)"}
{"text":"Good little spot, nice beer list"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink when on the road. Also a great place to meet new people, everyone is so friendly and inviting. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Hop In Brew!  What a great place to go have real conversations with your friends.  The music isn't too loud but there is still that pub ambience mixed with a bit of a house party.  Since it actually is in a heritage home, you instantly feel cozy and comfortable.  The staff is all very friendly and you get to know them better each time you come back.  I have never gone to the Hop and haven't found a place to sit.  There is always ample space and you will probably run into a friend or two while you sip your cider.  

They also have foosball and pool upstairs which is a lot fun if you are going with a group of people.  Lots to do!  

You can also order pizza in house which is so cool!  I don't eat pizza but if they ever get gluten-free pizza I am there!!!"}
{"text":"Hop in Brew is always crowded, but that only speaks to it's quality and popularity, so I can't list it as a negative. The outside looks like a frat house,  always with a few people standing around talking or smoking on the front porch. The inside is very cool, with sprawling little rooms with tiny wooden tables that are perfect for small groups. If you're here, please do yourself a favor and get the house favorite beer, Goldspur, but be warned! They taste like sunshine but pack a serious punch."}
{"text":"We didn't even make it to a table... A man was putting up chairs outside, so we asked if the restaurant was open.  He said well, the doors open isn't it?  Then he mumbled something.  I said oh your open sign is off.  He said yeah but the door is open... He continued: you must be one the one in a million people that actually care whether or not an open sign is turned on.  I said oh ok. He repeated, unprompted, once again how the door was open and how no one ever cares about the open sign being turned on and that it was clear the restaurant was open.

I asked if the owner was a smartass too.  He said he was the owner.  We turned around and walked our the door.  Poor guy seemed absolutely miserable. 

Please, do yourself a favor and don't visit this place apparently owned by a rude asshole who rejects customers... Are you open is a very simple question one would think. It was around 445pm. I guess the owner's rudeness is what the other yelp reviews meant by a very hipster place???  

There's plenty of places to get pizza and beer around the area... In Michael's now... Welcomed warmly!  Pizza is great too and has a rooftop area."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that draws you in before you even walk through the doors. And old,  white house with \"PUB\" painted in big red letters across? Awesome. I have been frequenting this establishment for years,  and it has almost ways been fun. The only time it wasn't was when some patrons hogged the pool table upstairs and wouldn't let anyone else play. However, aside from that,  the service has been great, I love their pizzas, and their emphasis on locally brewed beers. Also, beware the Goldspur. Drink it cautiously,  or you may have your worst hangover the next morning."}
{"text":"I had the most delicious beer here: Alley Kat Full Moon Pale Ale. Nicely balanced with fruit, sweetness, and hops with a lovely scent. The Hop In Brew was the only place in Calgary that I noticed it on draught and this fact alone would lure me in time after time if I actually lived here.

The pub is in a converted house and feels a bit homey (not homely). It is pretty steady early in the evening and seems like a nice place to start the night off before the line begins to form."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a sports bar to watch your favourite **insert sports team name here** play?  Don't come to Hop In Brew.  There are no TVs, and I dare to predict that there never will be.  It's part of the atmosphere they are aiming for.  Hop In Brew is in an old rickety house, with an old rickety porch and an old rickety balcony that seats about 4 people.  If you are lucky enough to get one of these spots on a hot summer evening, you'll be in for a blissful night.  On a cold snowy Calgary evening, you'll be happy to snuggle into one of the old school banquette booths or pull up a wobbly chair reminiscent of your grandparent's kitchen set.  If you really are in the mood for \"sports\", you can make your way to the second floor of the house, throw down a dollar and try to beat a hipster at some pool or Foosball.  There have been some epic Foosball nights here.

OR - you could saddle up to the bar and figure out which of the carefully chosen pints you'd like to try next.  There is often no table service, so you place your order at the bar.  The owner is a beer-loving gentleman that you'll often see cleaning tables or chatting with patrons on a slow night (which is pretty rare these days).  The list of beer on tap always rotates, and is always stellar.  The last time I was here, I had a pint of Lanny McDonald's new Hat Trick IPA. In addition to bringing the best craft brews in to be served on tap, the owner serves up a legendary beer, called Gold Spur, which is contract brewed by Alley Kat.  It's a flavorful Belgian Trippel which tips the scales at 9%.  They actually pulled it from their menu for a few months over the summer because apparently a few hipsters couldn't resist having one too many.  It's back, and hopefully the over-indulgers don't ruin it for the rest of us.

Hop In Brew is an old standby, and whether you are out for pizza, beer, or a game of Foosball, it will surely hit the spot.

Review #3 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Interesting pub in an old house that has some good character! .  A great selection of beers.  Some padded benches.  Very cozy feel.  A good place for conversation.  Kind of reminds me of Ottawa restaurants and bars."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is almost too adorable to exist! Nestled in a Victorian style house, tucked between modern buildings, is a gem of a craft beer joint!

I hear the pizza is great, and it sure looked (and smelled) amazing, but alas I was too full of tacos to attempt to eat it!

The beer selection was awesome with lots of local choices, and the bartender was super nice and gave me a couple of tasters before I decided. The place really reminded me of an English pub, and I can imagine on a busy night this place would be HOPPIN'! (Pun intended!)

This place is an absolute treasure - get visiting, Calgary, because this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"You want to talk character? This pub has got it. 

An old house that has been converted into a pub you say? Hell yes is what I say. With a variety of rooms in which you can choose to have your brew, with subtle music in the background and with some of THE best pizza in the city, Hop In Brew Pub is an absolute gem.

Their beer selection is most impressive and the atmosphere is relaxed and pleasurable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pubs that I've ever been too. They only have a handful of beers on tap, but what they do have are all OUTSTANDING. I'm particularly fond of the Brew Brothers Black Pilsner, I hope they still have that one.

The pizzas are also EXCELLENT - and I'm a pizza snob so that means something.
I only wish this wasn't located downtown, it's hard for me to get down there. Open a location in Acadia!!!"}
{"text":"In a converted old home, the vibe of this restaurant is like actually visiting a friend's home for dinner. The service is casual but so attentive; this place has heart to it that I've never experienced anywhere else. 

When ordering pizza, I had trouble choosing because the toppings seemed really basic-- no prosciutto or anchovies, no fancy meats or cheeses. But when my Canadian pizza came out? It was the best pizza crust ever. So crispy and delicious. With a great selection of beer too, if I was a local I'd be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to check out Hop in Brew pub a few days back, and I really liked it. 

It has the cozy feel of a place you want to return to again and again. From the outside it has character, and once you get in, you're greeted by a little staircase. You order on the right of the staircase, then find yourself a seat downstairs or upstairs. There are little alcoves all around this 'house'. Yes, Hop in Brew Pub is a house covnerted into a pub. I had the Aprikat beer which was delicious, and couldnt believe I never tried before. 

The nachos were gigantic, and the pizzas were not bad either. They had pool tables upstairs too.
I would totally come back here to catch up with a friend or two, over a glass of Aprikat.

{"text":"They have great beer and damned good food.  Plus the building is awesome and the clientèle is very cool."}
{"text":"Great place to go on the winter and watch the snow fall outside as you enjoy a drink."}
{"text":"We decided to meet up here for part 2 of Festivus. Wendy/Brad/Kenny/Andy/Brad'sfriend/Sabz/Chris were in attendance. But OMG was this place super busy and full of hipsters! As if the Drum & Monkey and Broken City weren't enough for my distant relatives to flock around :/

I do like the charm of this place. The close space allows you to inadvertently bump into your neighbor giving you the excuse to converse with them. Not too many servers roam around this place, you'll have to order your drinks and food at the bar. I was more than glad to make several trips to the bar to get a chance to say hello at ze pretty waitress who tolerated my lame jokes like \"wow, where'd all these people come from!? Isn't there a *obscure indie band* concert somewhere?\"

Their nachos were delicious and the peppers they put on were suspiciously hot! Also their pumpkin beer was amazing. I want to come back here for pizza and beers once again."}
{"text":"Hip, hop, a hip hip hop and you don't stop rockin' at the hippity hoppin' bippity boppin' Hop In Brew Pub!*

Sometimes you come across a place so incredibly awesome that you just need to write it a terrible radio jingle to bring it back down to your level again. Well, tonight it seems as if that place is the Hop In Brew Pub!

This is an unassuming old house in the middle of downtown Calgary, with charmingly friendly features and packs some powerful pints and pizza.

If you're starting to feel like a full on YYC savvy beer snob, you'll probably want to check out the Hop In Brew - with an ever changing super indie beer selection, who knows, you might just get out-snobbed!  Not only did that have 4 fancy pants IPA's on tap (only 2 I'd even heard of), they let me have a sample of each so I could see which one called out to me.

Yup. There are a lot of \"cool\" kids that hang out at the Hop In Brew, (well it's a cool place) but there are also ALL types that hang out there.  Construction workers, suit and tie 9-5ers from young to old - It's a casual \"come as you are\" atmosphere and everyone's got a place at the Hop In Brew."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - it's a house! Never tried the food but had several beers. From what I remember there was a decent selection. Our server was great - lots of personality. Check this out after going to Taste just down the road."}
{"text":"The Hop is one of the top tier pizza places in Calgary and one of my personal favourite spots to meet up with friends. 

So far we've had every TEDxYYC 2012 meeting at this local pub and I've been to quite a few Pixel and Pints meet-ups here too.

I'm a huge fan of these old converted 19th century houses. There's an air of history with a \"lived-in\" vibe, which makes it feel like it's made for conversation.

Their pizza is absolutely epic (especially with a great beer). My personal favourite is the Chernobyl, which carries a bit of spice with the Chorizo sausage and banana peppers. 

There are also plenty of options for anyone that isn't as fond of hot food.

Check out their full pizza menu: http://hopinbrew.com/pizza/

I also love their focus on local craft microbreweries. The Hop In Brew supports western Canadian breweries by only carrying certain beers on tap like Alley Kat (Edmonton), Big Rock (Calgary), Shaftebury (Vancouver), Tree (Kelowna), WildRose (Calgary) and a few others operating in Western Canada.

{"text":"First off, I'm an out-of-towner, so please do consider my lack of familiarity with Calgary as a whole.

I loved this little place! After spending some time in trendier venues in downtown Calgary, my friend and I were looking for somewhere entirely unpretentious and casual - an \"anything goes\" place where we could relax.

I wouldn't have even noticed Hop In Brew Pub if we hadn't been walking past, on foot. Otherwise, it might have just looked like an old house. I'm very glad that we did stop in, though. Walking in, the vibe was very welcoming, and cheery. These guys had gone all out with the Halloween decorations, and it was adorable. Good music was playing inside and the old bones of the house gave the join real character.

The service (at least on a Friday night) was bar service - no big deal. There was a good selection of beer on tap, including Alley Kat and its Winter Ale. Although we'd already eaten, we saw some mighty delicious-looking pizzas come out of the tiny kitchen - next time I will be trying one of those.

The crowd was mixed - there were some obvious University types, some business folks who were dressed up for a night out on the town, and lots of average Joes. We chatted with the tables next to us, and had a great time. 

I'll be sure to pop by this little gem when I next visit Calgary."}
{"text":"Hipster nation. Has lots of great draft beer. Probably wouldn't come here for real dinner again. They have a pizza oven you can get pizza, nachos or quesadillas. Quirky but laid back. Great random music and nice unpretentious vibe. It's an old house with a lot of character. Staff was friendly and drinks and food were quick."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I can't possibly Yelp this place, the Hop is post-Yelp, better yet, it's post-post-Yelp.

In fact, you can't even go here if you're Yelping this place. You are so over. You don't even know."}
{"text":"its an old house turned into a pub. i love the juxtaposition of the old house standing along side newer taller buildings. plus, the view of the calgary tower from the balcony is pretty sweet. love the atmosphere and all their beer options. However, i was told the pizza was to die for. it was a little bit TOO cheesy and not saucey enough for my taste. But the flavor combos were good. so if you like super cheesy pizza you might absolutely love it. otherwise, very chill place."}
{"text":"Oh Hop In Brew, how delicious your beers are...

If you live in downtown Calgary, you've probably visited the Hop In Brew many times. It's a great little house that offers you a wide selection of different delicious beers to try. I really enjoy this place because of the vibe that's always present there. There's always a diverse crowd with good music playing. I don't think you could have a bad night there. I honestly didn't even know they had food until I saw some posted here on Yelp. I'll post an update when I get to try. Oh and the bartenders are always super nice and very helpful in selecting which beer you should try based on your tastes.

I'll be back soon Hop In Brew."}
{"text":"Very well chosen taps. Do they mix drinks? Um, maybe... I dunno. I don't recall seeing anyone drinking anything but draught beer there.

They have a pizza oven and That Is Their Kitchen. You get pizza or quesadillas or eat elsewhere. Their pizza is quite good though.

Laid back, hipster type crowd, which I enjoy. Do you like going out wearing and seeing lots of bling, haute couture fashion and expensive haircuts? Well, if you do, keep going wherever else you go because this place doesn't need or want that bullcrap. 

It's an old house. Like, oooooolllllld. The toilets are upstairs. There's a lot of moderately dark wood and other hallmarks of a pub in here, and I expect they date back a long time. 

No TVs though. To me, that's a great thing. 

Also, they play pretty consistently interesting music, some of which dates back a while. To me, this is good.

Bottom line: I like this place. I like it the way it is. Don't mess up the vibe."}
{"text":"Hop in Brew has potential being that it's in a cute old house, has fun and interesting decor, a nice long list of beers on tap, and generally friendly staff but I always find it under delivers. The pizza is just ok. The nachos are an abomination. The prices are way out of whack to the point that when you get your bill for pizza and a couple beers at the end of the night, you feel like you've just spent an evening at Wurst except you didn't. I won't be making an effort to be back."}
{"text":"Holy crap is this place rad. 
At first glance this place simply looks like a house, well because it IS a house.
However some clever fellow decided it would be wise to turn this house into a home. A home for tasty brews and pizzas.
This place stole my heart in the single visit I had here. Very rad relaxed vibe (it is a house after all) with lots of great craft beers on tap and super tasty pizzas.
Only complaint is the bar gets pretty slammed and it can take a bit to get a drink at times, next time I'll probably double up on my drink orders to help avoid this problem.
Apparently on the weekdays they have table service which I'm sure makes this a none issue but on weekends its bar only.
We got some sort of pizza and it was super tasty. The beer was so tasty as well that I don't recall what kind of pizza we got. All that needs to be known is it was great and I destroyed it ninja style (left no trace).

I don't come to Calgary often (only once so far haha) but when I do I go to the m-fing Hop In Brew."}
{"text":"This is a very unique place...it's an old house converted into a pub. The decor is fun and makes you want to take a tour. The pizza was great. Crispy crust with a chewy center. The beer list was fantastic - try the golden spur. It a Belgian triple that is their own recipe!"}
{"text":"YOU. YES, YOU. YOU do NOT want to come here...or at least *I* don't want YOU to come here. Unless of course you already know that you must come here. This is my dive...or at least it would be if I lived here. Without a doubt the best place to grab a pint and chillout in Calgary.

I only went the one time. Tonight that is. Punk jams, but not too loud. Decent selection of taps. Pool and Foos upstaris along with the world's smallest balcony. Awesome front porch. I'm not sure what the crowd is like on the weekends...but for a Thursday I couldn't have been happier. Friendly conversation. Amiable staff. I'm a fan. 

It might even be in my top five favorite bars in the world. Actually, it is...pushing out Casey Moore's from the #4 spot:

#1 Shady's (Phoenix, AZ)
#2 Kilowatt (SF, CA)
#3 Emerald Lounge (R.I.P. - Phoenix, AZ)
#4 Hop In Brew Pub (Calgary, AB)
#5 Casey Moore's (Tempe, AZ)

#9 Nita's Hideaway (R.I.P. - Tempe, AZ)

Nice old house converted into cool dive bar. Feels like home. I hope I get a chance to come back someday.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Great cozy place. Ideal to rellax after school. Fussball and pool available."}
{"text":"I think the Hop is becoming a victim of its own success. 

It's nestled in an old house just off of 1st SW, and while it's been gutted to make an open space it still has that home-like feeling. It has great music (and they take requests. They once hooked up a friend's ipod!), tasty bar food favourites (try the nachos!), an awesome array of local beers and often resembles your super-cool friend's low-key house parties. There are pool tables and foosball upstairs, a balcony, and a variety of tables and benches to rest your drinks and hang out with your friends. For these reasons and more, I make my way down here pretty often.

The crowd is mostly made up of younger hipsters in their twenties and thirties looking for a quieter night out, and that is kind of the problem. Back in the day, before it became a \"destination\" you showed up, grabbed a table and settled in. Now on weekends the place is so crowded it can be very difficult to find a place to set your beer, much less sit down. There are only so many people you can squeeze in a house before it starts getting cramped, sweaty and a lot less relaxing. Not to mention the lines! The Hop has a tiny little bar that can comfortably fit only two bartenders. On a busy night it is not unusual to have to wait ten to twenty minutes to grab your drink.

My solution: we can just open a few more side-by-side so that everyone has a place to people-watch while keeping it on the down-low."}
{"text":"Boohoo; I had to say goodbye to a good friend this week that moved to Vancouver, her choice of departure The Hop in Brew.  

This is an old house that has been converted into a bar with a games room upstairs.  Pretty laid back atmosphere here, complete with bar booths and funky seating and wall covered photos and quirky bar objects.

Music was really laid back here, just loud enough to provide atmosphere but low enough so we could listen to our conversation.  Really sensational wait and bar staff, really attentive, casual and so eager to make our stay an enjoyable one.  The kitchen was closed so I can't write about the food but I did have a nice Kailua and milk cocktail that didn't have much bite but was good enough for 7 bucks.  Others at my table were enjoying their brews and although I don't drink beer I would drink it here if I could.

The place attracts young hipsters in their twenties and thirties and is a perfect place to just hang out.  It is a house from the turn of the century so it also has that paranormal feeling which makes your visit an even more engaging one...

So goodbye faithful Cat and Bon Voyage"}
{"text":"Great craft beer pub downtown. The Hop In Brew is an old house converted into a craft beer pub. The conversion of the old house into a pub gives it charm and a uniqueness. The bar staff were friendly and knowledgable about the different kinds of beer on tap. You can access their small sitting patio out front as well that feels like you're at a friends house enjoying good beer on a patio. Hop In Brew doesn't have the beer list that National or Craft are able to boast, however they do have a bar that feels like a pub and makes you feel like you are in a place that is it's own entity, rather than a corporate answer for bringing craft beer to the masses."}
{"text":"Beautiful old building turned into a pub. cozy and different from all other modern pubs around.

The reason I am not giving them a 4 or 5 stars is:
We found a table upstairs and sat down. 10 minutes later still no one had come to us, so I wandered downstairs and found a few menus and brought back up.
10 minutes later, no one had acknowledged us, so we had to remember (or write down) everybody's order and go back down to the bar, order and pay for it and carry the beer back up. 
It's a pub, so the beer is good, but the food not so much.

Tip: There are limited seats available and they fill up fast on busy days, go early!"}
{"text":"A little on the top... a little on the bottom. Hop In Brew continues to be a steady fave when I'm in need of a brew with some buds.

From Festivus with the yelpers in December to meetups and just popping in for a pint and some pizza, it has its own charm that just seems to keep growing on me.

If you're headed in, go early. Tables fill up quickly. Or, hang around the pool table upstairs. If you're lucky, you'll spot one freeing up soon enough."}
{"text":"Remember that night you went out for a few casual beers?

And you saw your philosophy professor? And you guys high-fived?
And the bartender had the most majestic mustache you'd ever seen?
And you beat a homless guy in a game of high stakes pool? 
And then a girl who listens to nothing that came out after '85 bought YOU a beer?
And at some point you consumed a Fin Du Monde just because they have to go get it from the basement when you order it?
And before you knew it, you were knee-deep in a conversation about meta-ethics with your PHIL prof and that cute girl wearing an ironic t-shirt?

Yeah, that probably happened here.

This is one of my favorite little dives in the city. No pretension. No promises they can't keep. Just a bar that looks like a house, you and some good friends and a patron base so eclectic it rivals the ship and anchor (though nobody can quite outdo that place for diverse patrons). 

I don't come here for the food.
I don't even come here for their beer selection.
Both are fairly average.

I come here because the atmosphere kicks ass. It feels like your best friend's house. The night will be whatever you make it - low key and chill or raucous and wild. There's foosball, a pool table, lots of booths and a friendly staff. One of my favorite moments of my 20's thus far was having a beer on their tiny patio during a half sunny/half rainy sunset.

Just like Erich said below, I'm worried about telling people how rad this place is because if this bar suddenly got overrun with barstar chicks in high heels I'd be extremely disappointed. This place just feels real - no posturing, and that rules."}
{"text":"I am in love with the Hop In Brew Pub. To the creepy extent where I do not want to even review it because if I tell you how much I love it, it might make you want to go there, and then you might ruin it for me because I am a misanthrope and like to hoard awesome things all to myself like gem-like little secrets. 
After not having the time for pubs in awhile, my roommate, our couchsurfer who'd never been to Calgary, and I took a little stroll on over to the Hop in Brew, in hopes we wouldn't come into close contact with Stampede goers there. Walking into the little house, I was absolutely charmed to see only three people in completely regular-person-clothes sitting in the back corner, having a lively little discussion with the bartender. This is the quietest I've ever seen the Hop, but it allowed for me to fully take in the adorableness of it, and we got the balcony all to ourselves. I started with a beautiful Hop Head the colour of straw, as I was feelin' an IPA. Later, I switched gears and sweetened things out with a gorgeous Yukon Arctic Red. Hands down the most intentional and amazing beer selection in the city. 
I would marry this pub; a small wedding with only family and close pals and alll of the beers."}

{"text":"I think this has to qualify for Calgary's only dive bar that somewhat caters to intellectuals. That is, you'll normally find a good bunch of people hunched over over-priced imports and micros discussing ... I don't know... Julian Assange or something. That said, the beer is great. Best tap selection in the city if you like the micro stuff, original decor, and just plain comfortable. It's my go-to local place in the Beltline. No dancing either which works for me."}
{"text":"Quaint, good food, great beers, and awesome crowd. I went on a Thursday evening and this was my first time here. You seat yourself and then walk up to the bar to order your drinks and/or food. Cassandra was working the bar and was so friendly and helped me out with beer selections. I tried the Aprikat and the Arctic Red both delicious! Food wise I ordered the nachos and had them add ground beef...these were your typical great nachos! Food arrived quickly and the size was huge! But my favorite part was the building itself. I felt like I was in an old college house (in the best of ways) I will definitely be going back my next time in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Charming little pubs in charming little character homes is apparently a \"Calgary thing\". No joke - I saw about five while I was there, happily visited two and had the same reaction every single time: An inherent \"Awww!\", followed by a sharp pain of homesickness (and generally, a pint or two).

Vancouver just doesn't seem to have the good ol' neighbourhood pub around the corner and this former Newfoundlander had her heart strings tugged a few times on Alberta soil.

My gosh, I love me a pub.

This place is pretty dang cute. It's got a pool table upstairs; a good craft beer selection and makes a great pizza. Really... what more do you want? Whimsicality + beer & pizza... it's the perfect combination. Bonus whimsy points for keeping the kitchen door open so you can see that yup, there's an ancient 60's oven in there. It's not being used as an oven... or at least, I would assume not, but it definitely reminds you that, \"Oh hey, you're in a wee house. Continue to be charmed.\"

Service is a little lassez faire, which is French for: It's a pub... go up to the damn counter to order. The BBQ chicken pizza is extra delicious with banana peppers added. And if they start carrying a better irish whiskey selection, I would consider moving in. 

Just kidding Vancouver, I still love you. Psst, Calgary: *wink wink*"}
{"text":"Loved this place! It has everything you need to have a good time. Great beers on tap, fantastic pizza and an amazing atmosphere. The old house feels warm and welcoming from the second you step inside. It felt like I was at a good friend's house party in college but with good beer. The staff was super friendly from the bartenders to the guy slanging the pizzas. It reminded me of some of my favorite places in Austin, TX but minus the hipster crap that normally comes with Austin. If/when I'm in Calgary again I will be stopping by and you should do the same. Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"Yankee alert!

Yes, I am American, and in my short trip to Canada, I could never get used to the fact that Canadian bars are packed with people as young as eighteen.

Regardless, I took a look at this establishment from the sidewalk and thought, \"This is a bar??!!  No way!!\"  I love how this little yellow house stands nonchalantly amidst the massive skyscrapers.

SIDE NOTE: This place is also the bar equivalent of my FAVOURITE cafe in Portland.  (See my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rimsky-korsakoffee-house-portland#hrid:kMZBNKqWmvMKYA_JWd9vew)  If you are ever in Portland, I highly, highly recommend that you visit.

Unfortunately, my party made this wonderful place the last stop of the night, so I can't even remember what I had to drink.  All I can remember is that it was very large and Canadian...

Get your thoughts out of the gutter!

It was a Wild Rose Velvet Fog, and it was delicious!  My friends and I spent quite a bit of time there and I enjoyed every hipster-y, rustic, eclectic moment.

Bravo, Hop-in-Brew!"}
{"text":"Is it a house?  Is it a pub?  Well, it's both!  This pub is awesome because it's been transformed from an old house into what it is now.  

The outside looks like a house, it's got different rooms to drink in, and it has a tiny upstairs patio (probably coming off the 'master bedroom').  They actually have to put a giant PUB sign on the outside so people know what it is.  It really is the neatest little place.  

The downstairs, or main floor, of the pub has a bunch of seating and holds the main bar.  It's located in what I would like to think of as the kitchen.  The drinks in the kitchen aren't that ridiculous, and they offer a bunch of kinds... even the ones with fruit in them!  The living room and dining room area hold the biggest and longest of the tables, so it's great for large parties.  It even has giant bay windows that overlooks the front porch.

Upstairs is probably my favourite part, though.  It has some seating as well as a pool and fuse ball tables.  The pool table is the master bedroom, and the fuse ball table is in what I would assume to be the secondary bedroom.

I really like to think of this place a second home.  Get it?  Because it looks like a house.  Anyways, it's totally awesome!"}
{"text":"How did this guy make the front page of the Hop in Brew Pub?  The owner?  

Nestled in-between some large city building it is completely out of place.  Like an old folk refused to sell the lot to the downtown development committee.  Reminded me of an old abandoned house I used to hang out in as a kid to smoke pot and drink brews.

When you walk in it is packed with people having a good time.  All sorts of genuine eclectic items on the wall.  Not that mass produced crap you see in so many chain restaurants now a days.  I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure each of those items has a story to tell.  So be sure to ask someone about them.  Someone in there knows something about those items.  

The beer is made offsite but using the recipe of the owner(s) whoever they might be.  

We had a great time.  Seating is limited so if you see a couple sitting at a table for 6 be sure to ask if there is room at the table.  You won't have to talk to them if you don't want but it could be fuuuunnnnn with brews in hand."}
{"text":"Beer great.  People good.  Best of all, NO TV'S  Yeah!  Just like a real English pub or irish bar. You can actually communicate with each other."}
{"text":"I agree with Kourosh...I'd give it 5 stars for the beer and the atmosphere, and about 2 stars for the food and service. Beer was awesome, pizza was edible, but definitely not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Major hipster hangout, but their fabulous beers make it okay to be seen there.

I absolutely love their pizzas and talking to the bartenders to see what new craft beers they are carrying.

No one could hate the cute vintage house charm, and the homey-ness that comes with it."}
