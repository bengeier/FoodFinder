{"text":"4 of us went for the first time for lunch. The place is empty. Maybe it is busier at the night, since it sometimes have live music and a dance floor for the night. It is clean and nicely decorated. My husband ordered the escargot, it came cold. He swears that it is previously cooked and it was microwaved to heat up. I ordered the cabbage rolls, it was on the cold side too. It was not tasty. I cook better cabbage roll than that. However, one of my friend ordered the Hungarian pancake. I had a taste of the pancake, it was to die for. So, if I return to that restaurant, it is what I will order."}
{"text":"Extremly hard to find great eastern european so im happy i found orbit. Great food. Great prices. Great portions. On par with food my grandmother would make"}
{"text":"Don't let your first impression walking into this place fool you! I walked in and its as if the power went out! Barely any light at all. What was even more weird, was that the tables way in the back and in those areas where it's kind of \"reserved\", were 100% set up with plates, napkins, glasses and cutlery, and there were only 2-3 other tables occupied in the general seating area. That freaked me out a bit, but I got over it once I took my first bite!  I was at Renaissance Banque Hall setting up for a gig in a few hours and needed some food as I didn't have much time to spare. I rarely try anything new as I am reluctant to be adventurous with my food consumption. So there wasn't much around and I decided to go in for a sandwich. I ended up with a massive plate of chicken parmesan, coleslaw and fries! I only paid a little over $9 for this chicken parmesan and it was flopping over the side of the bun so much that it was touching the plate. It was extremely soft and moist and with enough sauce to enjoy it and not taste saucy. Little to no oil as well. It was low on the grease. One other massive plus about my plate was the coleslaw. Very fresh and crunchy thin strips of cabbage, carrots, n all that good stuff they put in. Also not greasy or fatty, enough to taste but not overly sauced. The fries were \"meh\", but who cares, I had a massive sandwich and possibly the best coleslaw I've ever had. I challenge you to try it!   All in all, these Polskies know what their doing."}
{"text":"This place has really good Polish food and the portions are excellent. The prices are very fair. However, the waitresses need some improvement. They never refilled my drink during my meal. When I was done, I had to walk up to the waitress and ask for my bill because I was being ignored. This place has the potential to be a really good restaurant as long as they train their staff a little better."}
{"text":"Tried their Chicken Schnitzel for brunch and boy was it a lot of food! The interior looks dated and could get some upgrade. It is more of a pub/sport bar that can host weekend brunch and family dining."}
{"text":"Came for the third time the place was empty just one other table at 7pm on a Friday which is a shame as this place is fabulous! Service was quick, polite and straight to the point , had the soup of the day with potatoes and rice and veggies, really tasty. Also had the schnitzel and mushroom and the three types of salads they offer beet, carrot and coleslaw! Everything on the plate tasted fresh and heavenly? Will i be back? Definitely yes!"}
{"text":"Another location that is so easy to drive by without knowing it was ever there, located in a small plaza off of Dundas st E and Universal Dr this hidden gem has been a favorite of mine for a while.It's easy to forget about this place as the location is so reclusive but it does come with a private lot for parking and we all know how happy that makes me!! YAY!   This restaurant specializes in European Cuisine and is large enough to handle big parties and events which they often hold like Fri and Sat where there is DJ's and live music present. A large layout with a full dance floor offers a lot of space to move and dine in comfort that being said the decor is a little dark and dreary for my taste which is mostly because of the lack of windows however it is not the worst I have seen either.  Service here I do find inconsistant though, it can be absolutely amazing at times where other times it can be lacking significantly so it is a bit of a gamble. However there has never been a time that I had to wait for a table and the food service is fast and efficient so it does make up for the less then desireable service you can occassionally recieve.  The food is traditional and delicious!! The portions are huge and the quality of the food is good and consistant as well; they have a Borscht soup that is literally to DIE FOR! No joke it is hands down the best I have EVER tasted and I am part Russian! Prices are competitive too considering the portion size your recieving and the menu offers a large variety but if your looking for light and healthy food this may not be your best option as their meals tend to be a bit heavier offering a lot of deep fried breaded schnitzels and things like that. They have a full bar with a pretty good selection of wine and beer, I will admit I mostly come for the soup here and the odd dinner so I cannot really comment on the drinks but I have not heard any complaints from anyone I know that goes there to have a few drinks with friends.  If you enjoy hearty, traditional European cuisine and love a good bowl of Borscht then head over to Orbit and dine without the worry of your car getting towed ;)"}
{"text":"Great Polish restaurant right across from Starsky! My parents ordered the Polish platter (schnitzel, cabbage rolls, perogies, etc.), I had the Hungarian Pancake (crispy potatoe pancake coveted with chunks of beef and gravy) and my husband ordered the schnitzel with mushrooms. The portions are HUGE and every entree comes with 3 side salads (carrot salad, beet salad and coleslaw) and potatoes, rice or fries (if the dish doesn't already contain a carb). The food arrived piping hot and tastes authentic and delicious - just as good as the dishes from Poland! We went on a Sunday at 5:00, but because they were understaffed, there was a bit of a wait to place our order and to get the bill, though the food did arrive promptly after the order was placed. Other than that, everything was great. A must-try if you're in the Dixie and Dundas area!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Looks pretty elementary, but the food is fantastic and the quantities are HUGE!  The service is always top-notch. Very attentive and friendly."}
