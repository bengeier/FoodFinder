{"text":"Tried Moon sushi to compare to orher AYCE sushi restaurants.  As it is smaller than the rest it is a mixture of a mom and pop sushi restaurant with the popular AYCE style.  The sushi was fantastic but the cooked foods werent thay great. Service was good as it was very busy when i went."}
{"text":"Excellent service at Moon sushi ! It was a busy day but it didn't stop our server from keeping our tea cups full :) SUSHI craving was definitely satisfied! Used the 10% discount that Stephanie recommend in a previous review ;) We really enjoyed the steaming hot miso soup perfectly balanced not too salty or bland. We will definitely be back for the lunch or dinner menu. During lunch we really liked the  mango pudding dessert, crispy cheese wontons appetizers, FRESH salmon sushi , and the loaded Avocado salad. They had a very diverse menu, one you can't get bored of. Definitely coming back for dinner and lunch :)"}
{"text":"I regret taking my wife here, still had a good time because we always do, but seriously there is just too many areas of improvement this restaurant can make, it will take an Asian Ramsay. I would have enjoyed it back in the good ol' days with university buddies, but even then it's more of a value edge play. Definitely a two, maybe 3 if you factor in the lower price level."}
{"text":"The food here was great I loved their volcano rolls but the deep fried stuff was not as great as other places I have tried. Service was good they greeted us as we sat down. I would return to this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Okay place to eat, not fancy but cozy... went there for the first time today with baby and husband for Valentines probably the last time. Sad because there was a lot of variety but quality wasn't great for the most part.  Really friendly service but they did keep forgetting to give us items we ordered... and took really long. Sashimi wasn't that fresh... tataki was good though.. a lot of kitchen food, alright. Don't order appetizers not worth eating... gave out roses which was really sweet of them. And sorry but dessert was awful not a way to end the evening. Wish the food was better wanted to really like them! I've been to a lot of AYCE sushi places and this does not meet my standards.. :("}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets when it comes to sushi in Mississauga. I've tried to visit every sushi place in this city and I keep wanting to come back here. The variety on the menu is great, the food is good, the service is usually quick and the atmosphere is fine (although the music is a bit loud for my tastes).   Oh and the price! If you come for lunch you can have the only meal you will need all day for a very reasonable price.  Edit: Dropped one star due to some more recent experience. The last few times I've gone, a few of my orders never came and the food was far from fresh. Still a great value though!"}
{"text":"Very good?it tastes delicious and we all enjoyed the foods, we will plan to come back!"}
{"text":"So, we have ordered twice. First time was great. Today they delivered a vegetarian noodle dish with shrimp. I clearly said no meat nor fish sauce. Came with shrimp. Lucky I saw it since I am allergic and the worst part is when we called them, there response was vegetarian comes with shrimp. Wow. Brutal service"}
{"text":"The price for lunch on their website is incorrect.  Weekday lunch is 14.95 and Fri - Sun is 16.95.   Food was great and service was quick.    Asked if they would honor their website price but they refused.  We drove from the other side of Mississauga because they had the best price..."}
{"text":"Service was quick. Salmon tasted fresh. Bad attitudes of waitresses - didn't seem genuine in greetings and thanks. Lack variety of food and the iPad to select food is poorly structured compared to competing sushi buffets. Also the price is couple $ more expensive then other competitors for lunch which I don't feel is worth it."}
{"text":"From 168 to shushi shushi, now this is my new spot for shushi buffet can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"One sentence: Bring it on Heart Sushi!! Well this is your regular AYCE, but surprisingly the sushi does taste like sushi. I would say perfect fish to rice ratio. And all the appetizer items tasted pretty good compared to your average microwaved chicken satay. 8/10 would baaa... I mean visit again."}
{"text":"My fifth time there and NEVER disappointed. The food is very well prepared, promptly served, fresh, quite a selection. Its not too crowded and quite reasonable. It is rapidly becoming my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite AYCE Japanese restaurants.  Sushi and hand rolls are very good with not too much rice compared to fish.  Big selection of items even for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, come here for lunch everyday. friendly fast service and good for groups! The price is right as well, very good prices for the choice of menu items right at your fingertips! By far one of the best AYCE restaurant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The server's are very nice but the service is very slow. Waited about 15 minutes for someone to come, as a all you can eat place they should be constantly monitoring the customer. It's not really busy either."}
{"text":"The one thing I came for wasn't available on the all you can eat menu which was raw beef sashimi. The food took a long time to come and was average at best. They mixed up my order a few times and when I bit into a wanton in my wanton soup I got a big hunk of bone. The table where I was seated was in the way and everyone kept bumping into us. The Tempura was very tasty though as was the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"I don't agree with the bad reviews. This place is amazing! Great service, clean, big selection, delicious food. Only $22 incl tax per person for all you can eat right now (after the 20% discount until end of sep). You have to go!  My pick: fiery rolls in photo with shrimp."}
{"text":"I was a little shocked that this restaurant was rated 4*. The food was ok/good - but I certainly wouldn't say it was great. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to return. Personally I would rate it a 3.5 at best & 3 on the low end. There are other all you can eat sushi restaurants that are better within the area.   We found the following items somewhat bland and not as flavourful as we've had elsewhere - udon noodles, chicken fried rice, teriyaki chicken, Korean short ribs, green dragon roll, spicy sushi roll, deep fried milk, fried banana, scallop, salmon skin hand roll.   The following items were up to par - deep fried California roll, miso soup, avocado salad, mango pudding, ice cream, tempura.   The ambiance/environment was very monotone and awkward. It was very quiet - a little too quiet in the restaurant, the servers were a little too hovering, the decor seemed dark and diner like. On the positive side, service was very fast."}
{"text":"Yelp says they deliver, but they refuse to deliver to my area. I live less than 10 minutes from this restaurant, about 5km. What is the delivery radius, walking distance? I wouldn't need delivery then, would I? Good luck with this one."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. There's lots of selection and the price is what gives it that extra star. The hand rolls are really well done. There's very little rice in every piece of sushi I had too!!"}
{"text":"It's in a easy-to-access location. It is a lot smaller on the inside compared to how it looks from the parking lot. The pricing is very affordable for AYCE sushi and they have good selection. The sushi is decent and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"It's a great place for AYCE sushi, which left us pleasantly surprised.  The rolls and sushi were great., the rolls were very good, not too much rice. The dishes had a great presentation. The staff is friendly and the owners  really try to go a little beyond of what a typical sushi buffet has to offer."}
{"text":"Good AYCE sushi in south Mississauga. Fish was fresh. Ordering via iPad sped the process but the \"human\" service wasn't great so ambiance was meh.  The place was almost full during the 1.5 hours we were there, so it must be a popular AYCE sushi around the area."}
{"text":"I am not an AYCE sushi kinda person. At least, I never thought of myself as one.   But it was great here. Service was quick and efficient, everything that we ordered was what we expected or turned out better (I've been to one place that had a dish titled \"Mushrooms with Cheese\", which sounded great, but turned out to be a bunch of oily button mushrooms covered in butter instead).   The rice paper roll for example, with no rice and just avocado, crispy tempura, and sushi was SO GOOD. Portions are perfectly small so it's not hard to finish.   The \"fried milk\" was really weird but it was hot and crispy on the outside and the inside was solid-ish, until you bit into it, and it totally melted in your mouth like a liquid. So weird but good!   Great value for money here, and no complaints. We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"It is slightly better than kanda sushi  Pros -sushi is good  -order off iPad with picture of food. Cons -refills on your drink, it takes forever.  - sushi and other items didn't taste the freshest. Like it was frozen before hand."}
{"text":"Best Sushi ever! And all-you-can-eat lunch special is 1/2 price! You guys must try! Simply awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok when compared to other AYCE sushi options. The menu is focused on sushi and Japanese choices and doesn't have the wide variety of menu items as other places. Given the option, I'd visit another spot in Mississauga or Oakville."}
{"text":"Really liked the sushi here.  It was quite tasty.  Rolls were wrapped well and had good variety of choices to choose from.  Service was not bad either.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Hi everyone.  Just an update on previous review.  I still enjoy Moon Sushi but it seems there's been a change in management/ownership.  Big note:  The Yelp 10% off check-in offer is no longer being honoured by the restaurant (please remove it, Yelp). This was disappointing and non-negotiable.  I still enjoyed my meal, despite is also being more costly than previous pricing from last year.  The food is still decent but I'm less forgiving at a higher price point."}
{"text":"Just went today with family and it's really a great place to go to, especially with the 20% off grand opening. I really think they're sushi was great, the tempura shrimps, and many other dishes tasted a lot better than Yang's sushi imo with tons of deserts to choose from.   I also find the place not to be iffy and had a great atmosphere, the music wasn't overpowering so it's perfect.    Overall a must try place to go for sushi."}
{"text":"Came here for my niece's birthday, and it was an okay experience.   This place is near my house, so we were sent a flyer which is what originally attracted us to this place (20% OFF).    We decided to order from the regular menu as the AYCE was a little pricey for us (table of 9), and we preferred quality food over quantity anyways.... when we arrived, the servers were quick and the place seemed nice.  The food came out in a decent amount of time, but it didn't taste like anything special.  We also got a free cake which was nice.    Overall, this place was alright but the food wasn't really justified for its price, and that was with the 20% off!"}
{"text":"Love their small portions, was able to try all the things I wanted to without feeling obligated to stuff myself. They have a ton of variety which is awesome, including some cooked dishes like stir fry etc. The lunch AYCE is a great deal. Great food for its price. I always come here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I love sushi!!  We've been trying out new joints based on yelps recommendations and ratings.  No regrets about going to Moon sushi.  Would definitely come back again with the family.    Food tasted great.  Presentation was average.   Service was great thanks to Joann and Niki."}
{"text":"We try every AYCE sushi places around Mississauga. Moon Sushi has plenty to choose from and whoever was working in the kitchen when we were there knew what they were doing.   Soups, salads, grilled items, rolls and sushi were all done well and came out of the kitchen quick.   Above average service and taste.   Will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"I am a frequent of moon sushi. I must say that they are the best sushi place I've had in Mississauga. I always deliver so I can't say anything about dining in! I ordered dessert from here once though and it was gross but I will continue to order my sushi from here."}
{"text":"Ate there a few times and have been been happy with the service and food. Ordered from the menu the first time and the bento box was very good. Had the AYCE and it was great too. Everything was fresh and tasted great. The price is comparable to other places, but still with they were all a bit lower :)"}
{"text":"Celebrated my son's 7th birthday tonight at Moon Sushi because our previous experiences were great. Service was super attentive and presentation was awesome (served 6 pieces of salmon sashimi on the brim of a wine glass filled with ice). We also like going there because on birthdays, they give you a free cake. My son's cake was a tiramisu cake tonight. Last birthday we went to they got a mango mousse cake which was equally good. Will definitely be returning. To Moon Sushi: your cake really helped me tonight since we just came home from a weekend of camping up north. Thank you for making my son so happy. Your services and efforts were definitely appreciated!"}
{"text":"Went to this place to have a la carte but didn't know they have an option of AYCE. I started with rock shrimp because every review had rock shrimp mentioned on it, and I must say it was the best dish. Try the rock shrimp with spicy mayo.   Ordered many different sushis from Dynamite roll to Spicy Salmon roll and I can say that everything was fresh and tasted good.   The servers were prompt and alert, loved the service.   I would definitely come to this place. The only reason I gave them a 3 star is because of the ambience."}
{"text":"Loveee this place! My co-worker took me here and I have been going back ever since. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Recently ordered sushi from here online through Skip-the-Dishes and it was amazing! The shrimp tempura was perfect and all the sushi rolls we ordered were beyond satisfying. Thank you Moon Sushi :) will definitely be ordering again !"}
{"text":"nice restaurant! Fresh sashimi and fast service. love theice-cream herebetter than 168 sushi"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and really great service.  Everything is always fresh and clean. We often go as a team from work and the service is always quick to accomodate our lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place was soo good! Hubs and I were searching for ayce sushi in mississauga, and decided to try this place based on reviews. I'm so glad we did! Normally, you get what you pay for with ayce- either the food is average (or below average), or the service sucks. Not the case here.  We came on a Sunday afternoon, so not busy, and the resto was well staffed and we were served promptly. Everything we tried was excellent. The portions are well sized, although we like variety and could have done w slightly smaller portions in some cases (luckily, my dining partner is an excellent eater!), but overall I don't have any complaints. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"It's another all you can eat sushi place. Nothing truly inspiring about it but nothing too bad. Selection is slightly more limited perhaps, but I usually eat similarly at most of these places. It took a while to get the for once we'd ordered, but it was fairly busy for lunch. Even though I didn't really want them because I was full, I did have to ask about the last three pieces I ordered that never arrived. Mango shrimp was interesting. Still on the fence about it."}
{"text":"Solid new AYCE in mississauga.   Good service - friendly and efficient  Good food - quality and taste were spot on  Good location - right off the Qew one erin mills Good price - bang for your buck with a lot of variety and options for everyone!   Will definitely be returning here :)"}
{"text":"I had moon sushi last night and the salmon tasted fresh and so did the crab the spider and dragon rolls were outstanding and the best were the golden california rolls"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday with a group of friends to try their AYCE (very enticed by the 10% discount). The service was decent, but the food was definitely much better than most of the AYCE sushi places I've been to!  The fish was super fresh, especially the same and ikura. My favourite fish was the teppanyaki squid - we got four orders of this! The tempura shrimp was lightly breaded and fried, and the portions were large, albeit slightly greasy. I'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"No tuna sashimi. Always need that. Id pay more if needed.  Rolls half decent. No spicy tuna rolls either. I mean come on!!!  They started cleaning floors with chlorine when we were eating and that ruined the entire experience.  Will not recommend. Had high hopes."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't even have to give a star at all. This place was the worst. Meat wasn't cooked. They could kill someone. We told them the beef was raw and they brought back charred, black chewy beef. The pad Thai was basically maple syrup with noodles. I threw up in a washroom at the metro on the way home. This place will be shut down really soon. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"The 10% off must pay by CASH only. The food was okay--sushi was at least freshly made.  The grill items were so-so. Some were good, then the mushroom (grilled) was horrible--it was basically boiled (steamed) mushrooms with sauce on the top. The service was minimum. I came in at 3:30pm--it was not busy at all, and I paid my meal at dinner price--too bad that I didn't feel that I was welcome to this place.  I tried other similar buffets in Markham--it's way better food and service."}
{"text":"very bad . Sashimi is not fresh. Sushi taste is strange.Few choice.Service is also not good.Will not go there again. Not recommended."}
{"text":"OK, I admit it, I've been a little guilty of hibernating lately. So my reviews have been centered around places I've been outside of Canada and within a short drive of my home. But yesterday I had a sushi craving that wouldn't quit so I popped the Yelp app open and looked for under reviewed (but well reviewed) sushi spots - Moon Sushi came up.  It's a super convenient location for commuters as it's located just north of the QEW along Erin Mills (so if you're ever heading west in rush hour and you need a sushi pit stop this place is there for you). The plaza also boasts a Starbucks, a couple of breakfast spots amongst others, so I'd recommend walking off your potential road rage here.  I came in for lunch (which was super cheap) but once I saw how much more you got by paying for the dinner menu I went all in on dinner for lunch.   I ordered an assortment of regular starters like kalbi beef ribs, seaweed salad, miso soup and shrimp tempura. All were excellently seasoned, cooked or served at perfect temperatures but what I noticed was all the portion sizes were smaller that what I was used to at AYCE joints - definitely a cost saving measure on their part, but kudos on maintaining excellent quality standards.  The real difference maker for me always is sashimi servings, I can always evaluate a place based on this factor alone. In my opinion, they served up well sized, full portions of fresh fish that was neither too warm or crunchy because still partially frozen. This made me happy, and hence the 4 stars.  I also went for a few of their specialty rolls, and I found their selection to be very unique while still staying true to the popular standards like cali rolls, spicy salmon/tuna rolls, dynamite, and all the colours of dragon rolls.  My first two roll choices (names escaping me now) were quire good, one a touch sweeter and the other a little spicier. The third roll was pretty awful and made me gag a little. The issue was not in their preparation or freshness just in the combined flavour profile. I believe this was the fried salmon roll with squid and crab meat on top. It wasn't bad, but the combined flavours really didn't work in my opinion.  Overall a very good sushi experience, and I would certainly return to this modern looking Mississauga sushi spot!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Prices are being raised by $1.00, again (and so soon too), starting I think January 15th, so weekday lunch isn't $13.95 as the website still says but will be $15.95. The piece of paper posted outside the store announcing this change said that it was due to increasing cost in supplies, but I thought the salmon in my salmon sushi was of clearly lower quality even though I am supposedly paying more to make up for more expensive, same-quality-as-usual sushi.  The salmon used to be cut pretty thick and the nigiri sushi used to be bigger, maybe around half a year ago. But after the price increase, I found that the salmon was cut thinner, the sushi size decreased to mini bite size pieces, and today, the salmon was so thin that I couldn't even taste it. All I tasted was rice. The other menu items remain unchanged, but honestly, I've been switching around sushi spots for the past decade because of worsening quality of salmon sushi. Seeing this place cut back on salmon makes me want to jump ship and look for other places in Mississauga, but I guess I'll have no choice but to eat other rolls and side dishes and be satisfied with that for now."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided  to try this place after finding some reviews on same.  As we arrived and walked in, we were somewhat worried as the decor is satisfactory,  but lags behind other all you can eat sushi places in the city. Nevertheless, the place is clean, the seats are comfortable, and we are not cramped into tight quarters near other tables. The latter is an issue at some other sushi places  Some other people complained about the service in their reviews, but ours was excellent. Where this place shines is their food quality and taste  (relative to other all you can eat sushi places in the area). It is of high quality,  but also quite tasty due to being well merinated and spiced. The rock shrimp and spicey samon rolls are my top pics. The fried rolls with cream cheese are also quite good. The deserts were excellent too, minus the cheese cake, which was ok. The mango pudding is great. Lastly,  if you pay cash,  you save 10%. Overall, considering all factors,  especially food quality , this place deserves 5 stars. A word of warning,  as with any all you can eat sushi restaurant; eating an excessive amount (followed by having to go lay down when you get home) is a potential pitfall."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today with my bf. The atmosphere was nice the lighting and the booths. It was also not to busy and not loud. The food was ok. I really liked the rock shrimp and the vegetable fried noodles. The ice cream was good. As far as the spring rolls go they tasted like crap/poo literally! I guess thats why at the bottom of the menu it says whatever you dont eat you have to pay full price per piece. Ive never seen that at a buffet before. For the service they where fast but the one woman you could tell when i asked for more napkins since we only had 1 she wanted us to get out.She then said \"bill too\" I said \"no not just yet,just napkins please.\" She then proceeded to slam my ice cream down! As one of the moon sushi comments someone was saying about them hovering around we experienced that as well. Every time I looked someone was hovering right by the table. Would I go back? Maybe I dont think I would unless someone wanted to. Definitely not me offering to go back."}
{"text":"Went for friday lunch.  Good selection of everything you can expect in a AYCE. Loveddd their chicken skewers. The service at this place really stood out. Never had to ask for tea and water to be refilled.  Much more smaller intimate place than Heart Sushi and the like.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Compared several all you can eat sushi places and found that this is the cheaper place. But the standard of food and the variety is incomparable to other AYCE sushi places in Mississauga. I'd rather pay a few bucks more per person to go elsewhere. Salmon did not taste fresh. Also the price online is not accurate."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great! The service is a little frustrating as they are not very clear on the drink (pop) policy. Originally told us that Root Beer is free refill and then they told us it is not. But that's the only reason it lost a star. The food was great! I don't recommend ordering the sweet and sour chicken though because it's 90% batter and 10% chicken."}
{"text":"I was so surprisedly happy to find this restaurant on a long road trip from Toronto to MD. The price is GREAT, especially for the \"All you can eat\" option (around $12 per person to eat unlimited sushi!!!). They have a variety of choices, and everything tastes sooooo good!! The Sushi is particularly of great quality--very fresh and tasty. I feel very happy that I stopped by at this place and would definitely definitely visit again if I pass through this area again!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I both love sushi and have been to many locations for AYCE, except this place. After hearing about Moon Sushi from some friends, we decided to check it out. We both felt iffy about it going in.  We came when they were still having a 20% off grand opening offer (which ends at the end of Sept '14).   We were seated pretty quickly and provided menus. The menus were normal but the ordering sheets were different to us: it was a table format with a column for the quantity and a column for what food you want. Thankfully the menu had plenty to offer including all of our favorites.  We ordered a rather small portion to start, but it took almost 20 min for most of it to come out. Compared to Heart Sushi in heartland, that was significantly slower. You think that's bad? It came time to order seconds and they took almost 30 min this time. I can understand that if the place was busy, food can take time to come to your table, but when we went the place was less than half full. The service killed it for us here.  As for the food, it was alright. I liked how they displayed the sashimi. The portions were decent sized but nothing made the making rolls and other dishes stand out to other places.  My recommendation to them is to hire more waitresses and speed up the food. I can't imagine how it would be there if there were more people eating there."}
{"text":"Horrible service even when it's an empty restaurant-- the quality is okay, but the service is so horrendous. They forget your order, they roll their eyes at you, they act like they are doing you a favor when correcting their own errors.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Bernie my yelp friend would be proud as I have bookmarked Moon sushi for far longer than normal. After months, I finally was in the area and decided to visit. The place was much smaller than I had envisioned. It wasn't crowded for a weekend, which could mean good or bad. Service was lacking, though the food came out quick. The waitresses just weren't having it and consequently neither were we. Things I enjoyed include: avocado and flying fish salad, eel fried rice, crab sashimi was sweeter than normal, salmon was fresh though warm. The fried wonton was sweet and savory. The desserts unlike most ayce sushi restaurant came out in bigger portions. Things I did not enjoy: so far the soups are the only things I didn't enjoy, both the seaweed and hot and sour soup tasted like tap water. Hopefully the service turns around, so far I'm liking it."}
{"text":"Right off the bat i noticed the waiters had bad attitudes, but the service speed was pretty good and it didn't affect our dinner so its okay. The food portions were really good. I liked how their sushi's were a bit smaller than normal sushis, that allowed us to eat more varieties of sushi. The sashimi was very fresh. What i really loved about this place is that they offer a lot of avocado dishes. Most sushi places only have one or two rolls that have avocado on top. But this place had an avocado salad, avocado pizza, avocado roll, avocado cucumber roll, and the usual dragon rolls that have avocado in/on it. The avocado pizza was really good, the fried rice base was really crispy and not too sticky or dry. And the sauce on it was just the right amount and it went very well with the avocado. The avocado salad was basically just a typical japanese restaurant green salad with avocado slices on it, it was very simplr but very delicious. Overall for the price my experience was very good, definitely would recommend and will come back."}
{"text":"The dinner price for food is about $23 which is pretty good considering it's all you can eat. Service here is really good, and food tastes so good (especially the shrimp tempura). Also the food was brought out and made very fast which is a big bonus. The only thing is they no longer honour their yelp promotion of receiving 10% off when checking in...regardless I enjoyed the food and the service so I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is getting tired already. Same music playing every time we come, same weird \"art\" on the walls. Getting more worn and dirty and sticky. Might be time to seek a new ayce place..."}
{"text":"One of my top AYCE sushi places in Mississauga. I've visited during lunch hours and it's cheaper than other ayce places in the area. Sushi rolls can come out huge. Definitely recommend trying the Philadelphia rolls here! Staple!! Great food and selection. The only down side about the place was my last visit. During my last visit, there was a big line up of groups waiting for a table. I came in and the hostess served a couple that came in after before me"}
{"text":"Honestly...I think some people expect way too much from AYCE Sushi...Luckily I am not one of those people.  When I go to AYCE Sushi, All I expect is a Plethora of Options, Schools of Fish, Farms of Beef, Gardens Full of Salads....and a Mountain of Ice Cream!  Moon Sushi Delivers ALL of this and More! The quality is great compared to most other AYCE places.  All of the food comes out quick, fresh, hot or cold depending what you order. The service is great and they are extremely attentive to your needs. (sorry they do not supply sweat pants so make sure you come prepared).    There is plenty of parking in the plaza so you can stumble or crawl to your car after how full you become from eating at least 2 of everything on the menu!  We ordered everything from The usual Salmon, eel, tuna, butterfish, terriyaki steak, tempura, calamari, udon, miso soup, deep fried tofu, ice cream, and a ton of other dishes that were ALL delicious!  Add on the 10% discount for being on Yelp with the decent prices and you have yourself a 5 star AYCE sushi place!  I am absolutely willing to go into Orbit for Moon Sushi! Hehe."}
{"text":"My new place for Take Out!! Moon sushi us great for late night food runs as their delivery at skipthedishes runs untill 11pm on weekdays.   The price for the food is great! The portions are nice, for $11.50 you get a pretty big bento box that comes with a soup AND salad, teriyaki chicken, rice, 2 spring rolls, 3 california rolls and 4 pieces of sushi!!  I love the amount of heart put into to my bento box, from the spring rolls having a small folded napkin to catch the oils, and the dressing for the salad being added seperate shows how much care was put into my box .  I HIGHLY reccomend the teriyaki to anybody who wished to try teriyaki. It has to be the best teriyaki I've had.   The only negative experience I would express is that the sushi and rolls are a little penny pinched. The sushi was fairly small compared to all the local sushi around here and my rolls were falling apart because the seaweed paper ends never met.  CONCLUSSION: I am fairly certain I will regularly order takeout at moon sushi as I had a great experience"}
{"text":"I had come to Moon Sushi for the first time just this past Sunday for lunch.  A fellow Yelper had invited me to join so I did.  They had a special 10% off check in offer so we both took advantage of it.  Being that it is the lunch menu and which is common to some other AYCE places the menu is different for lunch than it is for dinner and the price is less as well.  Items such as sashimi, red tuna nigiri (white tuna nigiri is available), etc are not offered during lunch.  On the menu, dinner items are denoted in red so you know that those are only available at dinner.  To start off they have the offer the old way of choosing  your AYCE from the menu.  You have to use a pen and paper to say what number the item is and what quantities you want.  As usual items are told to you how many of each piece(s) per order.  Nigiri I believe were one each while some other items like the maki rolls were told to you usually in 4 or 8 pieces per order.  We both started off with a hot and sour soup.  The soup was good and I sort of missed having that soup as I hadn't had it in quite some time.  I also ordered an edamame and we each had a wakame salad.    For hot foods we ordered tofu, sesame chicken, house rice (mix of various meats, veggies and egg), kalbi (6 bones per order, nice!), mushroom beef rolls, chicken katsu and udon soup.  All the hot foods that I had tried were very good.  The kalbi was much more generous that when I went to say Heart where we'd asked for 2 x order of kalbi and were given 2 bones.  Moon gave us 6 bones in one order.  6, not 1, 6.    Everything is pretty detailed in the menu as to the quantities so there can't be any mistake really.    As far as nigiri, maki and other special rolls on the menu the presentation we got for the served plates was not something I necessarily expected to see at an AYCE place.  The presentation was more your a la carte type.  The Las Vegas roll we had for instance which was a crispy inside with cream cheese (really rich) as well as salmon on the outside came on large plate with drizzle shaped like flower petals and a single salmon roe at each tip.  Seriously you don't see that in AYCE at least I never have.  The main plate we had with nigiri and maki cut also had a nice presenation to it.   Overall the food here is above average and the prices were good for lunch.  After taxes with the 10% off our bill came out to just over 15 dollars each.  That's not bad.  Even if it was without the check in discount it would have still been less than 20 dollars.  The quality and service was well justified for the price.    I would like to return for dinner so I can experience the whole menu.  Overall I liked this sushi experience for a lunch AYCE and I'd like to return again.  The food is good, it's a good value and the service is good as well.  All positives as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This is my first time at this restaurant. I've been to a lot of sushi joints in Mississauga and this place isn't anything special. Don't get me wrong the food was great but it doesn't really differ from any other sushi restaurants.  What I do love was the iPad ordering system and what I love even more was the super fast service. Our food came right away and we didn't even wait 10 mins.  Oh, did I mention this place wasn't busy AT ALL. Which is a *major* plus! Considering the fact we came on a long weekend - so no wait times for us or overcrowding."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight on the back of some strong Yelp recommendations.  I also used the 10% check-in discount (thanks Yelp!).  Service was quicker than I expected at an AYCE, and quality good.    Tried a variety of the 200 items they offer including sushi, miso soup, spicy beef, and some signature rolls.  All good.   Ambiance good, although they were playing top 40 music(!?!) which seemed out of place for a Japanese restaurant.  Recommended."}
{"text":"The crab is all imitation. Don't call it crab if it isn't crab. It tastes like fishy chicken, and was dry. All the tofu tastes expired, and the nori stale. Staff were rude and did not pay any attention, with half the orders never appearing at the table, despite the iPad showing them as ordered.  Tempura and \"pizza\" (it's not pizza) were burnt more than Paula Deen's fried chicken. Everything tastes frozen and past expiry date. Chef Ramsay would have a fit at this place."}
{"text":"Ótimo lugar com excelentes opções no menu de almoço no AYCE. Cozinha rápida e atendentes prestativos. Refil de refrigerante disponível."}
{"text":"First time writing a review and I have to say I'm very disappointed..The quality of food is bad, feels like the servers are not happy with their working environment and both me and my friend got stomachache after eating there."}
{"text":"If you're looking for AYCE sushi and affordable pricing, Moon Sushi is the place to go. I've come here countless of times, primarily during their lunch hours. I've been here once during dinner and I felt the price wasn't worth it unless you are a huge sashimi lover. You can find all that you need during lunch for the price of $18.03 and they have a vast amount of food you can choose from (other than just sushi!). My friend and I arrived around noon and the placed wasn't terribly packed like most days. Today I got the green salad, golden calamari, salmon sushi, salmon rose, and for dessert the mango pudding.   GREEN SALAD: A normal green salad with literally one slice of cucumber, a small piece of tomato, and some type of sauce drizzled over it. I find that the sauce is usually either super watery, or decent at times. This time, it was watery but I could still taste the flavour.   GOLDEN CALAMARI: If you're a fan of calamari, you MUST try it out. Always crisp to perfection and the squid is always moist and never too chewy. Pair it along with the sweet sauce it comes along with, you have yourself a 10/10 from me.   SALMON SUSHI &  SALMON ROSE: So the salmon sushi and rose were both placed on the same plate and were aligned up gorgeously. However; the cucumber garnish made the presentation of the plate look like garbage and would have been better without it on. Anyways, what I love about the sushi here is that there's always an equal amount of fish to rice ratio. As for the salmon rose, it is topped with mayonnaise and fish eggs and truly does look like a miniature rose.   MANGO PUDDING: The only dessert I look forward to whenever I come here. The pudding is topped with a little bit of milk. The soft pudding will gently melt in your mouth and the sweet taste will bring you much joy.   Would I come back? Without a doubt, you'll most likely find me here stuffing my face."}
{"text":"Of the 20-30 ayce places I've been to in the gta this Is my favourite. We travel like 50km to get here cuz it's just that good. Food comes in fast and they don't cheap out on the expensive items by giving less than what we ordered. Using order sheets also makes it easy. If there was just one thing I don't like about this place is the chlorine smell that lingers. But that's not enough for me to knock down a star.  Crispy seaweed on hand rolls and their Philadelphia rolls I love them."}
{"text":"It seems like Mississauga has the best AYCE sushi in my opinion. I was pretty pleased with Heart Sushi but i'll have to say that Moon Sushi is on the top of my list now. This restaurant is conveniently located just off the QEW and Erin Mills Parkway in the Sheridan Mall so there's plenty of parking.   My family and I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1:30pm and even though it was pretty busy they were able to accommodate our large group right away. It was $14.95 per person which is pretty standard but if you check in and pay cash, you receive an additional 10% off.  SERVICE: above average for an AYCE restaurant; the servers were quick, attentive and friendly   AMBIENCE: nice modern decor with lots of seating, large bar area and TV's  FOOD: absolutely delicious! Usually you don't expect quality tasting food at an AYCE restaurant but Moon Sushi stands out in this category. Everything was so fresh and full of flavour. Some of my favourites were the beef short ribs, beef teriyaki, agedashi tofu, cheese wonton, and seafood udon soup. The maki rolls were perfectly wrapped and just the right size so you're not full so fast after eating a few. The sushi was so fresh and the ratio of fish to rice for each type of nigri was the perfect amount.  I definitely want to come back here and try their dinner buffet! I highly recommend this place if you want quality tasting AYCE sushi in the west end."}
{"text":"Very slow service, took 30 min for the food to come out. Taste of food is not too bad but the slow service was incredibly excuriating."}
{"text":"I recently visited this place for the third time.  The first time had good food, but mediocre service.  The next two times have had good food and great service.    My LOVES about this place:  -Flying fish egg sushi is delicious.  There's a nice crunch to the seaweed so you know it is very fresh.  -Their AYCE lunch is cheaper than Heart Sushi ($13.95 for adults, $1 extra for weekends & holidays) -Hot & Sour soup is awesome -Beef kalbi during lunch AYCE (so rare these days).   -Deep fried tofu is very good  My LIKES about this place -Service is very good.  They constantly pour tea for you.  -Fish is fresh and dishes are presented very well (look at the pics) for an AYCE place.  -The cooked food is not very oily.  For some people, it might be bland, but I find it the perfect balance between healthy yet tasty.  -They aren't too heavy on the rice for sushi and is the perfect bite size.  -The ambiance is better than Heart as it is smaller and more intimate, but it is not as cramped as Prince. I think it is the perfect size.   Dislikes about this place: -Not much really.  Some items could be better and they could offer a bit more desserts, but otherwise, this place is solid.   -Maybe they could have an iPad for ordering but it is a small place, so probably not necessary.  Overall, for the food, I'd give it 4 stars.  However, because of the cheap price (for AYCE) and the excellent service, I have to bump it up to 5 stars.  Note: They also have really cheap lunch specials starting at 7.95."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, not great but not terrible. But it was the service afterwards that I'm giving the 2 stars, we had maybe 8 pieces of sushi left on our plates when we wanted to get our check, one of the rolls we ordered, I forget the name now! But it has salmon, avocado and cream cheese, when we got the rolls it was 70% cream cheese 20% avocado and 10% salmon. My boyfriend and I couldn't stomach this so we let them know and the server said they would have to charge us extra because there was still food left on our plates, when we wanted to speak with a manager they brought in another server who said she was the manager but you could clearly see that she wasn't, she kept going on about how there's too much food on our plate but if we eat 4 more pieces then she wouldn't charge us, we told her we didn't like it and instead of being accommodating like a \"manager\" would or having discretion she kept questioning us on why we didn't like it or why we ordered it then, mind you it was our first time there so we didn't know any better. This went on for 10 minutes, she kept repeating the same things and lost 2 potential regular customers. If you want good service do not come to moon sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi Dinner July 7/15 We have gone to Moon Sushi a number of times and our experiences remain the same. Nice dinner out for 4 last night. Good Food, consistent service with polite waiting staff, nice atmosphere. The last time we came was for a birthday. Best to reserve for  a birthday, Moon Sushi doesnt just give you a piece of cake or a cupcake, you get the whole cake. they sing HB as well as do the music over the speakers.  totally different touch. If you check in through YELP you can get a 10% discount when paying cash.  Enjoy, located at ErinMills Pkway and QEW. worth the drive."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Moon Sushi. I came with my family to celebrate graduation, and it was a perfect celebration meal. They have a lot of booths to sit in that have high walls, whih I liked as it offered a bit more privacy than your typical seating arrangement.   We opted for the all you can eat dinner meal (aboua $26 per person). It's your general ordering style - they give you a tablet and you can work your way through the various sections of the menu as freely and as many times as you'd like. Some of my personal favourites was the thinly sliced beef wrapped around enoki mushrooms, the green dragon rolls, and their breaded chicken filets. Also good to note, drinks have free refills, so drink as much as you'd like!  Overall, great place, you get what you'd expect from an all you can eat sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was limited but my first round was sashimi, tempura, 3 different salads ( the avocado one is the best), green dragon roll, miso soup, salmon tataki, beef with garlic, stir fried shrimps, and Korean beef dishes plus agedashi tofu. The food especially the Korean and deep fried dishes were not oily at all but tasty. The sashimi was medium to thin sliced not as generous as heart sushi. Salads were the size of baby bowls and so were the desserts. Rice to fish ratio was mostly rice for rolls and wasabi wasn't spicy enough. Fish was fresh.The calamari was by far the best I had that reminded me of the colossus taverna  calamari in port credit. The ribs my friend had were Chinese A grade so mostly fat and bone.after the first round we pretty much ordered pad Thai, mixed veggies, the calamari, and beef with garlic but it was oiler the second time, and after we left I frequented the bathroom a little too much because I am really sensitive to oily foods which gives me digestive pain. The waiter was attentive, and food was ok to good depending on the dish but after 8pm when they change chefs everything is just bad to mediocre.  I have had Japanese food in my life since I was 7yrs old, and my mom trained as a sushi chef while my uncle has been one for 15yrs."}
{"text":"This is actually our second time here for AYCE.. Our first time here last year was a pretty good one, that's why I decided to come here for a second time, and as expected, everything has been great!  Food is delivered quickly, and service is great!  I believe this is the cheapest AYCE sushi place in Mississauga. And to add to the savings, you save 10% off when you pay cash.  Quality is really good for an all you can eat. Comparable to much more expensive buffets in Mississauga. This will continue to be my go-to AYCE place in Mississauga.    Review 28 of 100"}
{"text":"This would not be a place that I would flock to in a hurry, but not a place that I would avoid like the plague either. Nothing really stands out as being superb on the menu, but also nothing that stands out as being absolutely horrible either. I would recommend to try, but not with enthusiasm."}
{"text":"We ate here for Father's Day for the first time and we're thoroughly content and satisfied. We frequent AYCE buffets and aren't really big fans of sashimi, we prefer sushi rolls and this spot came through. Space is small and limited so be prepared to wait in line to be seated especially on the the weekends. Portion sizes are very small so order double than what you normally get but food was overall delicious. Staff was friendly but we did feel like we we're being rushed; they delivered the food quick and took the food away just as fast. This probably was due to it being a holiday and they wanted to seat other customers quickly. Would still go again."}
{"text":"I must say it is nearly impossible to find a AYE Japanese restaurant that offers good quality food.   I felt gross after eating here.   Maybe at some point this place was good from the reviews I read in the past.  But today for lunch, I thought the food was ok at best.  I would not be back here again.   The staff who serve me were nice people.  Role sushi was decent.  General Tsao chicken and sweet and sour chicken was off the charts - in tasting bad.   Korean bulbogi was good.  Everything tasted pretty generic; you get the feeling that owner of the restaurant does not care about making good food.    It is good value for what you pay, so I would try it if you are on a tight budget for Japanese food, but just don't expect much from Moon Sushi.  BB Lee"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! it is in my neighbourhood and I of course read the reviews and they were generally positive.   I entered the restaurant at 820 pm as the closing time was 10 pm so in our minds we had lots of time.  At 915 (45 minutes before closing time) the server informed my table that the kitchen was now closed. I questioned her as there was fully 45 minutes before closing but got a blank look.  I ordered ice cream and then sat there and waited as the entire staff proceeded to go in close down mode. All we could smell was Javex so we got up, paid and left. The table next to us also got up and left in disgust.   Since the sushi is nether exceptional nor of high quality, the servers are disinterested and everyone Chinese vs Japanese (I thought Japan created sushi) and there was no obvious management around - I will be looking for a new sushi place."}
{"text":"I would have to say this sushi AYCE place gives real good value for the money. There is a good selection, the taste is good and the service is very friendly and efficient. Is it the highest quality? I would have to say no but my expectations were tempered and if yours are too you will like Moon Sushi."}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted to have sushi for lunch, so we decided on Moon Sushi.  We went with the all you can eat lunch option for ~$18 per person.  Since we chose all you can eat, we ordered a large variety of items and tried to only get a few pieces of each.  We got some seaweed salad and avacado salad.  The salads were great and very refreshing on a very hot day.  I especially liked the avacado salad it was fresh and delicious.  For sushi options, we got 4 salmon sushi, 2 white tuna, 2 red snapper, 2 fish roy.  Plus three sushi rolls (avacado salmon, green dragon, and mango roll).  The sushi was made fresh and each roll had ample ingredients and good flavour.  I liked the mango roll as it came with two shrimps.  For hot items we had beef riblets, chicken teriyaki, tempura shrimp and salmon teriyaki.  Each teriyaki dish came in a small portion and the seasoning on the teriyaki was slightly lighter than average, but since we ordered a lot of food small portions and less sauce suited me just fine.  For dessert we had green tea and red bean ice cream.  Overall a good experience I enjoyed Moon Sushi, but do want to point out they charge extra for non-alcoholic soft drinks, so we ordered water.  It was a first visit and I had a good experience,  hopefully they will show consistency if we visit again. 3.8 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Much improved menu and presentation. A fair amount in terms of variety, service is decent, quality of food is also good. They are fast at bringing the bill, food and tea, but they don't hover around you. Ordering process is a lot easier now that they have iPads, when you enlarge the picture of the item you also get a small description of what comprises each roll, which is helpful.  I've gotten take out from here as well, and portion size and price is good."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Monday. The food variety was similar to other AYCE sushi places. However the sashimi didn't feel very fresh, grilled meats were a bit too dry. Overall food quality was slightly below average IMO."}
{"text":"Decent price for mediocre sushi. We had very slow service despite the restaurant not being busy. Customer service on the other hand was terrible. We were a table of 5, ordering our round of desserts at around 9 pm (that day they closed at 10 pm), when this one particular server thought it was necessary to impolitely tell us that they close at 10 pm. Not once, but on 3 different occasions: post dessert order, upon dessert arriving to the table, and mid eating the dessert. We were all aware of their closing time and did not intend on staying for much longer, but because of her we felt rushed out. I don't plan on returning, there are better places in the GTA to get AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Stayed at a nearby hotel and saw the good reviews. It's a fusion with all different types of food from Japanese, Korean and Chinese. I thought it would be similar to buffet quality food but I was completely wrong. The sushi is fresh and the grill items taste authentic!  Coming from the states with a weak Loonie, this place is a bargain and dirt cheap! I'd come back at least once a week if I have more projects up here. Oh, it's all you can eat too!"}
{"text":"1 star service, 4 star food.. As I sit here and write my review I'm waiting for my server to come and take my order sheet. It literally takes 10-15 mins every time for our server to take our order sheet, not the speedy service I'm use to at a AYCE sushi place.   My boyfriend and I came her because it's one of the only joints open today as it's a national holiday. The food is good however they're really stingy with their tuna, first of all they only have one tuna item on the menu (tuna sushi), the first time we ordered 6 tuna sushi pieces and they only brought out 1 of the 6, the second time we ordered the tuna sushi they brought white tuna instead. I know tuna is the most expensive item on the menu but come on! Don't advertise it if you don't want to serve it that's unacceptable.   I started this review with a 3 star and the longer I eat here the lower the star rating goes, I've been sitting here for over 10 mins writing this review and no has taken my order slip yet!  This is my first 1 star review and hopefully my last, never coming back again!  The food is good so I would recommend it for delivery however if you're looking for AYCE don't come here unless you enjoy slow service. If you're looking for a good AYCE sushi place go to \"Y'es sushi\" on Dundas & Winston Churchill.   *Drops the mic*"}
{"text":"Well another sushi spot near home .....great ..sarcastic remark incase you can't understand my writing .   No seriously ....I LOVE SUSHI , so why not try the fairly newly opened MOON SUSHI .  Well if you check in on YELP they offer a 10% check in cash discount ! . So i check in and show the waitress who was pretty friendly ..a little confused but friendly . Either way she forgot to add the discount to the end of the bill ...it's ok ...it's only money and we all know that comes and goes ..well to me or in my world it sure does . So if your super adamant about your discount than I guess double check before you pay !?  Anyways .....The food was average to me ...nothing special , nothing new , nothing fantastic . In fact If i feelnlike AYCE.. I rather go to 168 which is just up the street . I find them personally alot better but that's just my opinion ....and if i just feel like sushi and not AYCE THAN in much rather pick one of my faves near home momiji .....but enough COMPETITION TALK !!! THIS REVIEW is about moon sushi and it should be .  The food is average like I said .  -- 6 out of 10-- The service is pretty good ..        -- 8 out of 10 --  The atmosphere is clean and nice . --8 out of 10 -- Take a lady or your man ..date friendly --8 out of 10-- Overall ..7 out of 10   Give em a try if your in the area ."}
{"text":"Food is of decent quality, but the selection is a bit limited compared to the other ayce places in mississauga. Of course, this place is a few dollars cheaper than the other ones. However I would rather spend the extra money to go to a better place for better food and a bigger selection.  The beef teriyaki was a bit tough, the beef skewer was a bit better. I don't reccommend the beef dishes, it seems they use very poor quality beef.  On the brighter side, their eel sushi and roll tasted great, along with the mushroomi tempura. I also reccommend the black pepper salmon sashimi.  Lunch hour ends at 3:30, dinner price for an adult on the weekend was around $26"}
{"text":"My initial impression of Moon Sushi wasn't too impressive. Arrived to the restaurant 3 minutes after opening time, but it was still closed. For some reason, the staffs arrives to work the same time as when the business opens.... My colleague and I gave them an extra 10 minutes to set up before walking in. It appears that they don't have hostesses, so you can grab any table you like. I wasn't too impressed with the interior either. The furniture was old and plates were chipping. Our busser/ tea pourer appeared very nervous and hesitant the entire duration. He made me feel a little bit worried at first, but was extremely attentive. Our cups were never empty of tea and plates and bowls were cleared promptly. Food came out very quick, surprisingly! It was quite decent. Their salmon rose sushi, futomaki roll and eel sushi were my favourite!! You can also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp, but only with cash! If you're looking for best bang for the buck AYCE sushi in Mississauga, I definitely recommend Moon Sushi!"}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to find a good AYCE sushi restaurant in Mississauga? We ended up ordering from the menu,which looked good, but was pricy and didn't taste that good.  I am sure I had better sushi from a supermarket's fridge."}
{"text":"I came here for my father-in-law's birthday for lunch on a Sunday.   Food: It was very similar to other all you can eat sushi places. The salmon sushi was ok. The rice tasted fresh but the salmon didn't completely melt in your mouth. The shrimp tempura was good and comparable to other places.   The one thing to note is that sashimi isn't offered during lunch but I think it's fine because there's at least sushi. Besides the fish, there's lots of variety of cooked food like Thai chicken curry. The desserts were the usual ice creams and mocha mousse cake that I love dearly.   Good amount of choice for various personal preferences.   Service: The servers were attentive throughout our meal and the food came quickly. However, at times there were inconsistencies and mix-ups with the service. Sometimes we would place an order and the food would immediately come and other times the food arrived three orders later. This made it difficult for everyone to track what was still open which lead to duplicate orders. However the servers were very understanding in sorting it all out. It was just slightly inconvenient for everyone.   Overall experience: It's comparable to other places. Nothing stood out or was super special. Lots of parking and good location.   Cost: $14.95 per person"}
{"text":"The selection was decent and the price was pretty good! It was $15 for lunch on the weekend. All the food that came was very hot, which is always great. The food came on time and was very good. I will definitely come again. If the selection was a bit larger, I would've given Moon Sushi 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I would say this is my first choice if I want have AYCE. I came there for several times, it always make me happy. the sushi stuffs was delicious. I have to say that i love the dish which is called curry pork cutlet which is under chef's special,i think that is only curry dishes they have. The service always are friendly."}
{"text":"I don't frequent AYCE sushi places but I was really craving some bomb ass cheese wontons.  I was doing a lot of research on different suchi places in the Mississauga area.  Originally I had wanted to check out Heart Sushi but their reviews have plummeted.  That's when I discovered Moon Sushi.  Yo, everything was so good!  I am disappointed because there were several items I wanted to try that were only offered during dinner.  Either way, they were not short on items to make me feel like I was going to explode.  Yaaassss, cheese wontons were On POINT!  They actually deserved to be called cheese wontons.  They were FILLED.  I could eat these like chips.  Another standout for my gf and I was the salad.  I know right?  Wtf?  The salad dressing they use which is almost like a thousand island, was so delicious.  I wanted to get another salad at the end but really did not have any room.  I know the dressing is probably so basic, but damn it was so good.  Chicken cutlet was a little dry but I had so much other food, it didn't really matter.  Bulgogi and rice.  YUUM. The chicken curry had a nice little kick and was not too spicy.  Just the right amount.  My friends and I agreed everything was delicious and a good sushi spot.  We would all return.  ALSO, when you check in on Yelp, they give you a 10% off offer.  You must pay cash though, which luckily for me, there was an RBC in the same plaza.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Surprised too, seeing all the 2 and 3 stars. Maybe the place is only 4  stars but I'm giving it 5 in compensation. The food is delicious and is brought relatively fast. It is a restaurant I will definitely continue to give my patronage."}
{"text":"This place is not bad! It has all your typical all you can eat grilled meats and apps such as veggie tempura and shrimp tempura, beef ribs, edamame, and the list goes on.  Sushi is a good portion not over cut too big, nothing special about the sushi's  The place is mediocre, can hold about 30-40+ people.  Great for big parties or small parties."}
{"text":"The 4 stars are from the food, service and price. First, the food is good here. Rolls are presented nicely and tasted good. All the salmon based rolls are delicious and well executed. The grilled beef items were all excellent and were of a good quality.  Overall, the hot food items were great.  Service was on point and they said thank you all the time. I loved this. Checked in using yelp. Trust me ;)   One star off for old decor. Not a major fault but the place is showing its age.  Do come here for the food and service. 4 stars. ****"}
{"text":"No complaints with this place but it is not at the same level as New Generation Sushi in Vaughan. They have iPads for easy ordering like most sushi places, clean inside, and food came out quickly. I'd definitely go again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The rolls were of mediocre quality, while the spicy tuna roll in particular was too slimy. The fire volcano roll was good though. The sashimi did not taste fresh. The seafood pad Thai was simply awful, as was the Tom Yom soup and Hot and sour soup. The cheese wontons were too sweet. AYCE is usually not that great but this was worse than most."}
{"text":"It may have been good when it opened.....but not now.  Driving by Moon Sushi from the time the \"Coming Soon\" sign was put up to now when it has been open for a few months, I have been curious about the place but not enough to go in. After reading the wonderful reviews on TA, I decided to give it a try.   And after eating dinner there, I can't understand (other than not having a car) why anyone would eat here instead of KB Sushi which is just a few mins (by car or transit) away. In general, I am not a big fan of AYCE sushi, however, now and then a new place does surprise me. However Moon Sushi is not one of them.  The location was previously occupied by a Montfort Mediterranean grill and the interior hasn't changed at all....same old outdated booths and tables. The floors are covered in some kind of liquids that make walking to the washroom very dangerous. And I don't think the overall place is that clean.  The food itself is also NOT good. The beef short ribs are 50% fat, 30% bone and 20% meat. The sushi is small and presented on very warm rice. The chicken fried rice was oily and anything deep fried had a dark colour characteristic of oil that has been used way to long.  The price, $22.95 for dinner is the same as KB Sushi but the interior, food and service are nowhere near as good. So if you're planning to go to Moon Sushi, do yourself a favour and try KB Sushi first."}
{"text":"We had literally 6 individual pieces left and were told we need to finish 3 pieces or will be charged. I felt like my mom was forcing me to finish my food. I understand that they want to control wastage but ours was so minor. Never ever coming back here again."}
{"text":"Since our favourite AYCE sushi restaurant in Mississauga (Saki Sushi) changed its business model and became a la carte, we had been searching for its replacement, which we knew wouldn't be an easy task.  We tried Heart and 168, ones we had been to several times in the past, but the taste, quality, and presentation of their sushi were not anywhere close.  We'd also been to Moon once before and were not overly impressed, but after studying the reviews and photos once more, I decided it was time for a revisit. I knew what to avoid from last time (and from reviews) - the fried rice, which was overly greasy and filled you up.  Well, the bet was good this time, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. My favourites were the Pink Lady roll, Dynamite hand roll, BBQ eel sushi, BBQ eel sushi pizza, and Yummy Yam roll. The calamari was nice and crispy, and not too oily. We also got the sesame chicken, which I found very tasty. If I had more space in my already very distended stomach I would have got a lot more than the 8 dessert items (deep fried milk was delicious, but not pictured).  Presentation and taste were excellent, and variety was good, though they didn't have grilled beef skewers nor spider rolls, which Saki used to have at lunch buffet (which may partly account for why they had to change).  We'll be back soon with the rest of the family after this scouting expedition!"}
{"text":"I came here for AYCE a couple times with my boyfriend and overall it's good! they have iPads now for ordering so you can select as much as you want and it gets sent straight to the back which is nice because you don't have to wave around a piece of paper to get the waitress' attention to put an order in. The service is meh, but it's all you can eat so that's to be anticipated. The price is best during lunch on a weekday, and they have so so many options that it's definitely worth it and the sushi is actually pretty good and fresh! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service, the Place Smells and the Place it Dirty.  The Waitresses Treat you like you like it's an Inconvenience.  I will take my Business Elsewhere.  You can have your Rotten Dirty Place.  Good Luck."}
{"text":"Most terrible service. Waitress was rude. Food were terrible. Not authentic Japanese food. Teriyaki chicken was awful. Tasted like boiled chicken and poured teriyaki sauce over. Short ribs were tough. Worst sushi I ever have. Not fresh. I would say \"No star.Don't waste your money there."}
{"text":"Came back here today for the first time in a while. I had heard about some food inspections, but all seemed okay when we made it in. Quieter atmosphere with a good Japanese music selection. They've recently switched to the iPad ordering system which makes things much easier to keep track of.   I really need to give a high-five to the servers. Having accommodating and good-humoured servers at an AYCE sushi does not happen and it is not something you expect. The servers connected to us with warm smiles and little jokes, and when a health problem was presented at the table, they went out of their way to assist us and ensure we were okay. Furthermore, we got EVERY dish we ordered, with no mix-ups, at a fast pace, with constant check-ins for beverages and satisfaction. I was SO impressed!  Their fare was what it was; nothing out of the ordinary of AYCE sushi. I appreciated the good size of the salmon roses that you can actually eat without falling apart, and the availability of Thai and Korean dishes. Great apps. There was not too much rice on everything which I am a big fan of; no \"tricks\". Their spare ribs were a little fatty. Love that they are one of few places that offer their fried panna cotta (milk pudding). A nice treat!  Thanks for the impeccable service today, Moon Sushi."}
{"text":"I've been to Moon Sushi a few times with my husband and we enjoy coming here since it has all of the types of sushi that we enjoy eating and just good variety of food overall. He particularly enjoys the sashimi and salmon rolls, which he says taste really fresh. I particularly like the simple eel rolls, eel with cucumber roll and spider roll. I'm also a fan of their cheese wontons, yam tempura and scallops. I personally didn't really like their spicy crispy roll - not enough crispy bits and way too much spicy mayo but there are so many other options to choose from anyway. Their ratio of rice to ingredients is also excellent - just enough rice but not too much with just the right amount of fresh tasting ingredients.   We also like the prices here, especially with the 10% off with Yelp check in and paying in cash. It's definitely cheaper than many other AYCE sushi places in Mississauga that have pretty much the same food options and are mediocre in comparison. It's under $25 here, which is a great deal! This place is consistent in taste and pricing, unlike fellow AYCE competitors like Heart Sushi which seem to have gone down in quality but up in price.  There are plenty of clean booths and tables. The floors can sometimes be a bit sticky underneath the tables but not a big deal since the food is good.   Service is okay - nothing extraordinary since the servers literally bring your orders and collect the dishes when you're done. Again, people don't come to AYCE sushi places for amazing service anyway.   Worth going to if you're in this part of Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Fantastic AYCE - great price, excellent service, solid food. Really enjoyed ourselves. Love the Yelp discount for first time visits also.  Will definitely be making this a regular dinner spot."}
{"text":"3.5* - pumped up 'cause servers were quite polite and weren't whipping dishes across the table.  What can I say about AYCE sushi?  I always think it's a great idea when I go, but soon after I start eating, I feel gross, regret and subsequently forget the whole ordeal.  It is what it is.  Lunch on a weekend was $14.95pp then I had an additional 10% off after checking in with my Yelp App.  So it was like a coupla bucks more than just ordering from the a la carte menu.  Other than tea, soft drinks were not included.  I didn't order anything too crazy or over-the-top.  Rolls were done well, nothing fell apart.  Fish was pretty fresh, on par with most of the other AYCE places nearby.  Atmosphere:  More like a diner/family restaurant.  Dessert-wise:  Order the Deep Fried Milk!  I really liked that one.  Green tea ice cream tasted gross."}
{"text":"I have been doing take out here for some time now, which has been good. I finally sat in and did AYCE lunch for the first time yesterday. It's actually really decent sushi... is it on the same level as an authentic a la carte Japanese restaurant? No...and truthfully you shouldn't expect that from any place that serves California rolls lol. But for an AYCE restaurant I think this one is quite enjoyable.  Given the other AYCE places in the area (168, Ye's, and that terrible place near the Cineplex theatre... I forget the name ) I'd say in comparison this place is better quality and value for your money.  I don't eat meat/fish, so I can say that the veggie items I had were enjoyable. The veggie fried rice was a bit disappointing but everything else -- hand rolls, sushi pizza, maki rolls, etc. I thought were good.  My dad had all the meat/fish stuff and enjoyed it all. I do think they have a good variety on the lunch menu here, especially for the price. They were quite fast but it wasn't really busy while we were here... Not sure what happens at peak hours. Take out is fast too. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Four stars for now until we return again to see how consistent Moon Sushi is.  Everything AYCE was tasty to very tasty and arrived at the table quickly enough for our lunch time liking, so I am not sure what all the fuss is about?  This is a great addition to the area, replacing the Monfort Grill House that used to occupy the space."}
{"text":"Good sushi and more relaxing then the more popular places around GTA.  Food came out quickly and tasted great, salmon was fresh and good amount in every roll. Avocados were fresh a creamy. Only thing I didn't like was the soups which is fine by me.   I never thought I'd say this but not having the iPad to check your orders seemed a little  inconvenient.   Overall this place has great food, decent ambiance, and way more calm then heart or 168, but don't have the flair of those 2 (ie iPads)."}
{"text":"We took the Moon roll, Spicy salmon rolls, a scallop roll, the Dancing Dragon roll and the Beef enoki roll. Omg!! Everything was just SO good. We couldn't stop talking about the sushi, even the next day. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"food is excellent but the service sucks. It would be nice if the service was a little better"}
{"text":"Lots of options! Very affordable! Very polite and accommodating staffs! For a lunch AYCE, they have so much great items on the menu already. What more if its dinner? But overall..... I WILL COMEBACK. Or should I say I'll keep on coming back from now on :)"}
{"text":"Good food, and pretty solid pricing.  Our waiter was a little rude, but that was okay.  Besides the fact it is definitely a place worth trying out!"}
{"text":"THIS JUST IN!  They now have the iPad ordering system. Loving this place even more :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi place! We have been soled by this place no other does any justice. We have tried slot of different Ayce places but this one takes the title!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last week and it was alright.  I am a sushi lover/addict and have been to many, if not all, sushi restaurants in mississauga.  Food was good but it wasn't anything special.  They had Tataki varieties which was great as Heart sushi only makes Salmon Tataki.  Service was fast did not have to wait long for our food to arrive.  It also wasn't busy as we did come here on a holiday and did not have to wait to be seated.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner. It was a weekday and the restaurant was quite quiet. We ordered a selection of sashimi, sushi and some hot items from the kitchen. The fish was fresh, and the rolls were delicious. Tempura was nice and flakey. I usually go to Heart Sushi, but the quieter ambiance and toned down environment (compared to Heart Sushi anyways) makes it a more intimate and enjoyable place to eat."}
{"text":"Super decent AYCE sushi place. The price is in a similar range with other AYCE place and food is also quite comparable. In my opinion, the food quality seems to be below average. Kitchen dishes are all overcooked and turned out very dry. Sushi roll contains huge chunks of rice and avocado. Sashimi is not so fresh. Chef'sal is not so special and not much fusion dishes in comparison with other places. Overall, I rather to pay extra bucks for better food. I am not planning to come back again!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Waiter was in hurry all the time. Lost half our order. Decent tasting food but ingredients were not the best."}
{"text":"I went to Moon Sushi because it was listed as a top 5 AYCE sushi restaurant in Mississauga and it sure lived up to its ranking! It has the usual iPad ordering system that we've come to expect from AYCE restaurant, and the order goes straight to the kitchen without you having to wait for a server to come confirm the order! The raw fish was fresh, tempura was crunchy and came out piping hot, the selection was extensive. The orders came out quickly and the servers filled up our teas every time we asked, and we asked a lot! The only reason why I'm not giving Moon Sushi the fifth star is because the restaurant is quite small - there's only about 20 tables. We went with 4 adults and my baby had to be sat in the aisle in the highchair. She would make a grab at the plates every time the waiters tried to put the food down! Oh, and there's no change tables in the bathroom either. Besides the minor setback, I will definitely be going back ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are looking for awesome sushi and a small more intimate atmosphere! Been here twice and gotta say their sushi will have me back a third time! From their staff to their food- loved the place!"}
{"text":"I went to Moon Sushi on a Saturday for all-u-can-eat Jap food for $15. The place wasn't well decorated, but it was clean.   Happy:  There were a lot of selection of foods if you are vegetarian. Their avocado salad was divined as the avocado was ripe and the sauce was perfect! I ordered many times!! The food came at a normal pace and it was HOT. I like my food hot, not just warm. The bulgogi dish had enough beef and veggies. Love it! The rolls were nicely presented and the rice was still warm. The service was pretty good for an Asian place.   Not happy:  I found out that some dishes from the menu (the ones in red) are only for dinner time. So read the fine prints first. They also don't have the ipad system of ordering like some other restaurants. Write down the number of the dish that you want.   Verdict:  I was one happy CAT walking out of the restaurant with my tummy filled with yummy food. The price and food was the right amount and I would definitely go back even though it's a drive for me."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem, love the sushi and one of best AYCE Sushi Mississauga. (I also liked Prince sushi).  I can tell foods are fresh, Service is good and decent. Only downside is that it's small place and they don't take reservation so have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food. +1 because of the low  prices.  I took advantage of the yelp check-in and cash discount (10% off) but it would've been pretty cheap either way. The sushi was decent but the fish slices could've been thicker. No sashimi at lunch so I can't comment on that.  The few special rolls they had were pretty average. I'd avoid the LA roll and yummy yam rolls. Both weren't very good. The red dragon roll was decent. They do have really good spicy salmon maki rolls and spicy salmon sushi.  The maki rolls were crafted very, very well overall.  They didn't fall apart and the rice used was minimal.  The non-sushi food was hit and miss. The avocado salad is amazing- very large slices of fresh avocado.  They really do not skimp on avocado- the salmon avocado roll is filled with it. I liked the cheese wontons, beef short ribs, enoki beef rolls, calamari, and any of the tempura. The tempura sauce they use is awesome. It has a slightly sweet flavour that most sushi places don't use for whatever reason. The seafood udon was not my favourite.  They did miss a few orders which was fine because we probably over-ordered. Kind of strange though considering all the wait staff and the place was half-empty."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great one when it opened however it seems to have gone down hill lately.  I recently dined there.  They are now using a tablet to order.l which is positive as prior they use to forget items you've ordered.  The worst part is that even if you leave one small portion left on your plate due to being full  the staff will charge you an extra cost.  I was charged $3 extra ridiculous.  In addition I had an issue with the pad thia.  I told the waitress that I didn't like the taste.  She went away to ask the chef and came back 2 min later with an attitude that this was the way it was suppose to taste.   I can't believe that I was argued with about my taste buds.  I won't eat at this place again."}
{"text":"The best place !! I love it here!! The best place!! Great costumer service as well!! They have the best way to make sushi ."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of sushi joints in Mississauga and by far, this restaurant is definitely a good value find - the quality of the food and portion size is impressive for the price.  Went on a Friday night for dinner because I needed my sushi fixings, and was surprised and concerned that it was really pretty empty and quiet. I was skeptical at first but when I saw the presentation of the sushi and the consideration in its size, I was elated to find my new go-to-spot in Mississauga.   I'm definitely looking forward to coming here for AYCE lunch - I'm stoked to see the same quality for a solid price of $13.95!"}
{"text":"This is not a great sushi place at all!! I came here with some friends today for the AYCE menu. We chose this location using Yelp and based on the reviews. Well it must be all the employees friends and family eating here and writing reviews because the rating does not match the quality of food nor the level of customer service we witnessed today.   First, the food did not seem fresh at all. Everything that came to the table had very little flavour. The tempura shrimp was all tempura and no shrimp. It was also very oily. The texture of the rice was horrible. Let's just say this was the worst sushi we have ever had. We did not even finish the items we ordered because it was so bad. Also, one server kept refilling our cups with watered down green tea every second. We realized they use this trick to fill us up on liquid so we don't eat as much food from the AYCE menu.   On top of it all, we showed the server the 10% off our bill offer from the Yelp app once we checked in. The server said we could only claim the offer if we paid cash. One out of the 3 of us had cash but the server was adamant about giving us the discount only if all 3 of us paid cash. Since my other 2 friends were paying by card none of us were able to claim the discount as per the server. I have never heard of this \"rule\". Additionally, because I showed the server the discount on my phone, without my permission she pushed the \"claim now\" buttons on my phone screen as if we had already claimed the discount. So even though she came back to the table and said we can't use the discount she already claimed it on my phone so we would not be able to return and try to claim the discount again. Well not to worry because we will NEVER come back to this spot even if we had a 50% discount. Horrible food, and horrible service. If I could give them zero stars I would.  Do not even waste your time coming here! You're better off going to Heart Sushi or buying sushi from your local supermarket!!"}
{"text":"Really great all you can eat restaurant in the area! I really enjoy the comfortable seating and love to come here with the entire family. The prices are really affordable and they have an extensive menu. The ipad menu makes it very easy to order as well!"}
{"text":"This is a weekly outing for my parents and I. The service is always top notch and very friendly. The menu could use greater variety, and portion sizes could be improved."}
{"text":"We have tried many AYCE sushi places in Mississauga and this is one of our favourites. The sushi is fresh, presentation is very good and most importantly it is flavourful unlike many other places.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and it turned out ok. Service is quick and they are good at refilling the water or tea. My bf thought the tea tasted watered down. The food was mediocre. The sushi was pretty good as well as the tempura but they forgot to give us the sauce, and the rolls and hand rolls were a bit off, almost as if the fish was not fresh. I had ordered a roll of the spicy white tuna but they gave me a hand roll instead by mistake. Good thing because I didn't want more. Sweet and sour chicken was bland. Overall nothing else was that great. After the first round my bf did not even order anything else, except for ice cream. I ordered some more sushi and that was it. We used the check-in on yelp and paid cash so we got 10% off which was nice."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and very good pricing. The location is nice and spacious, plenty of parking, busy but not annoying. I came with a group of 8 people from work and we were served quickly and everything was correct. Service is very good, food kept on coming and empty plates and garbage kept on going. It's very close to the office so we'll probably come back."}
{"text":"We decided to give Moon Sushi another chance after the raving reviews from other Yelpers. I'm glad we gave them another chance because we had a much better experience than our first visit.  We arrived for their AYCE dinner at 6:30 and were seated right away. It was a weekday so they weren't busy. We were seated in a booth that was against the former doors that have been sealed up. However, there was quite a lot of cold air coming in so me and my friend were pretty cold during our stay. Besides that we don't have any complaints. We only did two rounds of orders and everything came out quickly and nothing went missing. The servers came by frequently to replenish our teas which was nice and attentive.  Remember to check in and redeem their 10% off discount with your Yelp app!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here last week.  I got here around 12:30pm and I was surprised to see that it wasn't packed. A waitress greeted and seated me right away. She then got me menus and then served me green tea right away. Yay! We are off to a good start.  When my friend finally arrived, we got right down to business. First we each ordered a seaweed salad and it tasted very fresh. The small portion was great for me since I only wanted a taste.  We ordered the following: - Mackerel and salmon sushi - Las Vegas roll - Golden California roll - Salmon cream cheese roll - California hand roll - Salmon avocado hand roll - Futo maki  Everything tasted amazing and fresh! My personal favourite was the golden California roll which is rolled in batter and then deep fried. It was still kind of hot after a few minutes but I couldn't wait so I slightly burned my mouth.  If anyone is ever near the Clarkson GO station and is looking for a good sushi fix, this place is highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"I just visited this place for dinner after reading up the reviews, and I think this place is great.  It looks big on the outside, but feels more cozy on the inside.  The sashimi was fresh, they had actual white tuna, and not the typical butter fish where restaurants call that white tuna.  The Red Snapper melts in your mouth, and I've almost never had that from a sushi buffet place for it to taste that good.  The kalbi short ribs and the tenderloin bits were delicious, the key is to eat it once it arrives.  It was favourful, soft and tender, however once it cools it doesn't even compare to when it was first served.  The soups were kinda meh, but theres more than enough items to make up for it.    get the yelp app, and check in for 10% off.  It wasn't overly busy on a weekday, I've been to plenty of sushi buffets in Sauga, and this is probably my new favourite place.  Food portion size was great, not too small, but not too big, perfect as sample size portions.  Sashimi was nice thick cuts.  My first time here, and already have my eye set as the goto place for sushi buffet in the west end."}
