{"text":"Berm they're a few times.  Food was okay,  herded in and out like cattle.  Not my favourite place for Montreal smoked meat but it will do when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I heard things about the employees taking over the place. If they did, then good for them. Last Sunday, we ordered old fashioned smoked meat medium, coleslaw, potato salad, dill pickles and a loaf of rye bread. Heaven! The meat crumbles apart, just like it's supposed to. It was so good that I had to order it again the next day. Seriously, I did."}
{"text":"Great deli ! Food is amazing all the time. Sandwiches are nice and warm and staff are really nice. Prices are very reasonable. I usually get the smoked meat sandwiches. The soups are also really good. Just a great old fashion place to get deli meats and soup. Be sure to try their fries as well. I'm glad places like this are also still open."}
{"text":"Authentic deli.  Best in GTA.  Hand cut is best."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat sandwich in town! and if you're a salad person, get the Greek/Chicken salad, you'll be taking part of it home since the portion was huge. Also I picked up a box of moon cakes from their bakery on the other side, nice and light with good flavour!"}
{"text":"It had been a long while since I've visited this place so imagine my delight when I found myself in the area again and went in for a quick lunch that the food and friendly service was as great as i remembered. 

I used to work near the Centre Street Deli and a co-worker turned me onto the amazingness of the Jewish Deli. I had always been a fan of cured meats with bread but the corned beef, rye, pickle and mustard combo got me good. Since then I've compared all other corned beef sandwiches to this place, and it still remains one of the best. Their weekend brunches are excellent as well."}
{"text":"This place is not what it used to be.

Cole slaw used to be their strength. Today we ordered two cole slaws.  Mine was good and fresh and  crispy.  My sons was warm and soggy.

The smoked  turkey is over salted.

Waiter was rude and told us the cole slaw cannot be changed and brought it back!

We walked out.  First time I have walked out of a restaurant.

Horrible experience."}
{"text":"A definite must if you live in Thornhill. Old-fashioned, Jewish-inspired menus with killer sandwiches. Come in hungry, leave there breathless."}
{"text":"Love this place. Eat in or take out. Greek salad is amazing. ..the creamy dressing makes this salad very unique.  Chicken soup with krepleh (spelling?) extremely tasty. Old fashion sandwich. All food great. Service wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Centre street deli is not just a restaurant. It had an unique offering of food and  home style service. 

Today would be my fourth visit but I realized that I may not have left a review (oops).

We always ordered the platter of Old fashioned Montreal smoke meat platter , and a cherry coke to remind us of Schwartz in Montreal (which is no longer our favourite due to snobbish servers and not so good food value ) 

The platter was tasty and we love the 60 diner type setting. 
All their servers are very seasoned and the younglings are the helpers. 
Our server Bessie was attentive and detail-oriented. 
So we had a great meal and would definitely go back again and again"}
{"text":"I have not been here in ages and I'm glad to see it still has the same charm I remembered.

I had the old fashion medium pastrami sandwich and a latke. the pastrami.. was AMAZING. It was melting in my mouth.. oh how I wish I had magic powers to make one appear right now! The latke was nice and crunchy, definitely hit the spot.

Service was very friendly, our glasses were never empty, and they took the time to explain the menu a bit for us. Even the other customers were friendly and nice!

I can't wait to bring everyone here, people need these sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat sandwich in town. Forget about Schwartz, this is THE place to go.
I also received the best customer service from a waitress named Ingrid. We had no idea what to order and she offered detailed and helpful suggestions (always with a smile). I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally a place who serves REAL Montreal Smoke Meat.  I moved to Toronto over 10 years ago.  I missed the smoke meat and bagel.  Well my search is over.

I found somewhere for my bagel fix and now Centre Street Deli for smoked meat.  I'll have to try their bagels.

Too many places in and around the GTA say they serve Montreal Smoke meat but don't be fooled.  They don't.  Centre Street Deli REALLY does.  They have great fries as well.

I like the regular medium smoke meat.  Lots of flavour and a few delicious calories.  But forgot about the part and treat yourself every so often.

Price is good, service is good and fast.  I went Sunday evening and the place was packed.  There was a line up. Don't worry, the line moves very quickly.

I'll be going back for my Smoked Meat fix pretty regularly."}
{"text":"Really really delicious but prices are too high. They've increased over the years. One of my fave places to go when I'm in thornhill though. Well run ship."}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Saturday afternoon and it was crazy busy! It's a good family/group spot. 

They don't seat guests until the entire party is there, which I think is a good policy to have. The staff were all hustling to keep up with the packed house, and they were friendly to top it off so that was a bonus!

Tried the smoked meat sandwich with fries and slaw, and a salad on the side. Nothing is going to top Schwartz's, but as far as the GTA goes, it was an amazing smoked meat sandwich! The fries were awesome, but the slaw was a bit too sour for me. 

Didn't really get a good look at the rest of the menu, but it looked like they had a lot more to offer. Must get a better look at it next time... 

I wish it wasn't so far out of the way, because I'd totally be a regular!"}
{"text":"$3.25 for a can of pop??? Deli meat filled with fat. Never going back."}
{"text":"We had 2 old fashioned montreal  smoked meat sandwich classics, which is a deli sandwich served with a salty pickle, coleslaw and your choice of fries or a salad and freshly squeezed orange juice. The coleslaw and fries were good. Sandwich was good but I've had juicier at the corn beef house. Orange juice was amazing. Service fast. They also gave us complimentary homemade shortbread crackers. The bill came up to $43 before tip."}
{"text":"Short but sweet review...It is the best montreal smoked meat anywhere near Bathurst St. :)"}
{"text":"A strong contender for best smoked meat sandwich in GTA (although still haven't been wowed), and certainly takes the cake for the best latkes. The ambience is a bustling family restaurant with many well lived servers. Enjoyable."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat I've had in the GTA, easily on par with Montreal greats, and I've eaten them all.  Pricing is very reasonable, quality and quantity is great and the staff are always knowledgeable and friendly.  They turn tables well and are always busy at lunch.

Their take-away for bulk food is also good, well priced and high quality items available."}
{"text":"This is going to be difficult for me - putting my love of Centre Street Deli into words.

Although I am a Toronto girl, born and raised, my family is all from Montreal and so deep down, I'm a Montreal Jew. And Centre street is, by far, the best and most authentic Montreal Deli to be had in the 416-err 905. In the province.

Favourites include the matzo ball soup, the chopped liver and onion and the latkes. But hands down, nothing but the smoked meat really matters. Old fashioned and medium please. Lots of yellow mustard.

Seriously the best, I prefer their parent restaurant, Snowden Deli in Montreal to even Schwartz. Enjoy. I'll be there soon, writing this has awakened a major craving!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a deli expert, but this was a pretty good experience. I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich with a side of slaw. The smoked turkey was flavourful and there was a lot of it. The slaw was a vinegar-dressed slaw rather than a creamy slaw which I loved since I prefer vinegar-dressed slaws. It reminded me of the St. Hubert slaw."}
{"text":"Best Montreal Style Old Fashioned smoked meat sandwich I've had in Ontario. I've been coming here for almost 20 years. Hand cut as you like it, lean medium or extra fatty. Mustard choices (ask), and don't forget to order a pickle on the side. In my opinion best way to order is on rye bread (imagine a mountain of smoked meat with a piece of rye balanced on top), but if it's to be eaten \"to go\" try it on a kaiser, you'll make less of a mess. Cookies and pastries are also great. Not to be forgotten... black cherry soda. Try a can. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Its been some time since I visited the Centre Street Deli but I would like to spin a Yelpy-Yarn for you all about my last visit there. 

Just over a year ago my girlfriend at the time and I had been in SERIOUS talks about what we always discussed with little levity. Food. Specifically in this instance we were both feen'in for a taste of authentic Montreal Smoked Meat. 

But where ever would we find decent MSM in Hogtown, the home of the Back Bacon Sandwich?

Doing what many of you reading this do when in a food dilemma, I took to my magical inter web machine and searched \"BEST MSM IN TORONTO\". The search results were plentiful as I hoped the meat would soon be. However the one place that seemed to be reviewed and mentioned the most was not in the heart of the city... no friends, to my surprise it was only a mere 10 minute drive away in Thornhill. Hurrah!! VICTORY!

Located on the north side of Centre street between New Westminster and Dufferin, you have to keep your eyes open because its nestled in the rear of the plaza. Upon entry the sights and sounds (and smells) of a classic Jewish diner/deli attacks all of your senses. 

We were seated quickly and after struggling with the menu for several minutes we were ready to order and followed the recommendation of you Yelpers and went for the Old Fashioned. 

We also decided to order two Kosher Pickles and a Latke to share.

The Old Fashioned was piled higher than my water glass with hot, fatty, hand cut pastrami. So much meat that the slices of Rye Bread assigned to this sandwich were struggling with crowd control. The Latke was light crispy and wonderful and the Kosher Dills just tied everything together. *drool*

All in all a wonderful experience that helped me get my fix until the next time I visit La Belle Provence."}
{"text":"This is casual Jewish deli done right and by that I mean smoked meat, cream cheese, bagels, lox, kischke, cabbage rolls... these guys even serve bacon - that's my kind of Jewish. :) 

Now if only they'd open a Centre Street Deli on Bathurst Street, maybe south of Bloor? #wishlist"}
{"text":"I haven't been in a while and won't be back.  Prices are crazy high - $8.75 for a 2-egg western on Wonder bread and almost $16 for a Greek salad.    Service, however, was good. There's nothing special here so I'd go where I think my dollar is better spent, its not here."}
{"text":"I am disappointed with my fav place as today i ordered 1 1/4pound and trusted that thats what i would get. I go to my parents house and open the bag and it is so little meat in there. I am sure they gave me less and charged me the full $30. There was not even a label with a bar code and weight as there usually is. The person helping me directly punched it in at the cashier. First i found it odd that he took me to the cashier to pay. There is no doubt that the food is good. But make sure u check the weight before paying. I have always had good service here but one experience makes me think that maybe i was given less the previous times too. The owner should be aware that the service is not weighing properly as this will spoil the amazing reputation of this place. I feel disappointed and of course hungry and a bit embarrassed showing up with less food to my parents house. I always order that much so i know approx how much i should be getting."}
{"text":"You come here for an old fashion smoked meat sandwich and oh my gosh I was in heaven! 

Found this place on yelp and fairy close to home,  a must try!

Server was nice and friendly, got my food after 5 minutes of ordering. Everything was fresh,  loved it! I'm coming back and going to eat more of that meat!

And I had Schwartz's over the summer from a food truck and this was better in my books! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best smoked meat and corn beef in the GTA.
The menu has a wide variety of food to choose from.
Also the deli counter has a diverse range of meats and cheeses to take home. 
Usually busy, so arrive early!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars for the food - rounded up to 3 for the incredible service.

I wanted to try this deli for years but never got the chance. I finally tried it and I'm sorry to say, it was a let down in my opinion. The place looks and feels like a good deli should, but the sandwiches were sub-par. I visited Caplansky's deli in Toronto the week before and thought the food quality was far superior there. 

Service was the best part of my experience. As soon as you walk in, your greeted with a smile and brought to a table. The server was fantastic, so incredibly friendly and helped us navigate the menu. She gave us suggestions to save money when we placed our order. Watching some of the other servers, they were all equally good. Food arrived very quickly as well.

We tried the Smoked Meat sandwich combo and the Smoked Turkey sandwich combo. The combo's come with fries, pickle and cole slaw.

Smoked Turkey is usually one of my favourite deli sandwiches but this version was just too salty. The portion is huge but the salty taste becomes too much very quickly.

The Smoked Meat sandwich was the real let down for me. The flavour just wasn't there - it completely lacked the mix of spices that make real Montreal Smoked Meat a legend. Texture was also off, kind of like the meat was boiled. This is one of my least favourite smoked meat sandwiches.

The staple of a good deli is the Smoked Meat and Smoked Turkey - if these items are not up to par, the best service in the world will not make it a great deli. I'm in no rush to return.

{"text":"You know, I am shocked at the number of positive reviews on this place! I mean, yes, it's not bad and carries all the traditional Jewish foods, and it has become somewhat of a deli-institution for Thornhillers - but my goodness the place is pricey! I went last weekend, there was a huge line up. Ok, fine we waited. We were seated close to the door and every time someone came in or out we got a strong wind of cold air. We both asked for lean Corned beef but it was thick and fatty. The bill for two adults and one child (who just had soup and a fruit bowl) was 50 dollars. WAY too expensive. I was also not impressed witth the matza ball soup. I think next time I'll skip this place and head straight to my mother's house."}
{"text":"This place will never change, and that's a good thing! Hand-carved, real-deal Montreal smoked meat, \"medium old fashioned\" means medium fatty, deliciously smoked and seasoned Montreal smoked-meat, on super fresh rye bread with your choice of yellow/hot/brown mustard, and with lots of really excellent fresh-cut fries, what more could you ask for? 
Go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome Deli, Montreal Style! Not too many of these around in Toronto anymore. Reminds me when I go back to Montreal. The famous Jewish deli's, Schwartz's, Snowden Deli, Lester's, Dunn's and Wilensky's. Went to Centre Street Deli today, the place was packed but we waited less the 5 minutes for a table for two. I ordered the Pastrami special which comes with fries, coleslaw and a pickle. I had to get a karnatzel on the side and a black cherry soda. Food was delicious and came fast to the table. The pastrami was soft and tender. Tasty for sure. The rye bread was fresh and soft too. French fries were one of the best I've had. $46 for two specials and drinks. Not bad. If you have a craving for a good deli sandwich and you are in the area of the Promenade Mall, check them out. You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've been going to Centre Street Deli for pretty much my entire life- I even remember their original location.  

Best place to go for a smoked meat sandwich in the entire GTA-  old fashioned, medium, with hot mustard! Yum! 

And the potato latke's? Soo yummy!

If you haven't been- drop what you're doing and get your butt over to the Centre Street Deli!   Second only to Schwartz's!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is the GTA's best pastrami spot. The waitresses are charming and informative. '70's diner vibes inside but what really matters is that sandwich. The selection of mustards is a bonus. You can't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed which is sad because I used to work up in Thornhill but that was a couple decades ago... not sure how long this place has been around but it sure looks like it's been around for a long time.

The place is big, big and big.  This restaurant has the kind of footprint you probably just will not see if you're in the city because of the space.  There's a large dining area that seats maybe 80 or so and there's a deli counter to the right upon entering.  

The menus look like they've been around for years as well.  Worn menus mean things don't change often because they just don't have to.  Old looking menus tell me this place doesn't have to be fancy or trendy or change their prices often because things are just right.

There were 3 of us so we decided to go with 2 platters which include platters of meat, a side of fries and cole slaw.  We upgraded one of the side fries to sweet potato for 1.50.

We didn't have to wait too long before two nice looking platters of meat came our way.  I had ordered one corned beef and the 2nd was old fashioned (more spicy) Montreal smoked meat.  They gave us 12 slices of bread but ultimately I had asked for another 4 slices to finish off the meat.

The platters are pretty generous, and while we didn't make sandwiches an inch thick of meat there was enough meat to make 8 sandwiches between us (16 slices of bread total).

The meat was very good and the kind of meat that you would want to go out for because this corned beef and Montreal smoked meat is NOT your cold cut variety.

This place serves real deli style meat because they are a real deli...  their food is what you would expect to get out of a sit down deli kind of place.  

The value is not bad either... the platters were about 21 dollars each.  The last time I was in NYC and we went to the Carnegie Deli our Woody Allen sandwich was about 27 dollars (with split fee).  Mind you there was probably as much meat in that single sandwich as there was on the platter, still a reasonable price.

The last time I had a true deli style sandwich was in Montreal at Schwartz's and I have to say this was very comparable.  

I'd definitely return to Centre Street Deli when I'm having cravings for REAL deli style sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Very nice deli with great service and food. Love the Old Fashion meet sandwich. Nice deserts too. Very recommended. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nothing special, and the handwritten bills are kind of annoying, but the food is great and good options for kids"}
{"text":"This is the place you need to come to for kick ass corned beef. Not every deli gives the options of med (fatty) or lean and that in itself is worth the trip. Don't mind the long lines because the place runs like a well oiled machine. We came with a line out the door and we're advised nitro worry the line moves fast. Low and behold the line moved fast. Service is quick food is excellent, all you need if you are in the mood for deli."}
{"text":"Food is what you would expect from a deli, so don't come expecting originality, but food is very well executed.  The smoked meat sandwich is hands down the best I have had to date, which includes the Montreal smoked meat institutions...make sure to ask for medium and not lean"}
{"text":"Center Street Special Montreal Smoke Meat Old fashion Medium
is a must"}
{"text":"I used to really like deli, but this new \"diet\" I'm on only lets me have salty meats on occasion, and this place was the perfect cheat meal.  

I had the Old Fashioned special that comes with dill, coleslaw and fries (or choice of side salad - I opted for bean salad).  The coleslaw and bean salad was your standard fare, but the Old Fashioned (smoked meat) sandwich was delicious and they gave a copious amount of meat. The meat was seasoned perfectly and while it gave you that \"salty\" flavour of deli, it wasn't an overwhelming salty flavour where you needed a litre of water after to get rid of the after-taste.  

Overall, if in the area, this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"When I wanna be bad, it better be good and Centre Street Deli is oh so good!  

Wickedly tender cut of 'medium fatty' smoked meat, crispy cut fries delicate and soft on the inside, non- greasy on the outside. The coleslaw is fresh and tasty with the right balance of crispy, sour, salt and sweet  - perfect to cut the aforementioned fatty goodness. 
 All of this combine under the bright fluorescent lights of a generic suburban plaza, for a delicious and decadent lunch. The steady stream of old Jewish clientele is a sure sign of the goodness of the food here.  Gawd love this deli!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Centre Street Deli for years now and it's never let me down.  I'm a creature of habit and always get the Old Fashioned...and it blows me away every time!  The coleslaw is great...and the side pickle is a nice touch...but the fries really make the experience.  Crispy and flavorful!  

You won't be disappointed with your experience...especially since the service is terrific."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the best delis in the city. I prefer the smoked meat Lentel or chicken noodle soup and a Greek salad. A meal for a king."}
{"text":"New ownership.. Smoked Meat is a little inconsistent now.. Greek salad still the best but no way they get my 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly, and generously portioned. This old-school diner is absolutely bustling and serves up massively stacked meat sandwiches. I tried the smoked meat poutine and it was glorious. My friends both had the club sandwich, which was piled high with a variety of meats and accompanied with perfectly crisp, thick-cut fries. Can't wait to go back and try the latkes and matzo ball soup or to get knishes and other baked goods to-go from their massive takeout counter!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I finally got my fix of Montreal smoked meat.  Although if I was honest, I'd say that I would love another one for dinner tonight.  It's been 4 years since I have been here and it's just as great as I remembered.  I remember when they first opened, I'd be there once a week and when I moved, it's one of the first places I love to eat at.

Everything is fantastic.  Yesterday, I had an old style Montreal meat sandwich on rye with a side of their mouth watering cole slaw.  I skipped the fries although I know they are some of the best.

I also took some heavenly cheese bagels to go (they are all gone already) and some karnatzel.   I also love their Greek salad, which is one of the very best.  You can't go wrong if you love delis ... the tough part is deciding what to have ..."}
{"text":"What a nice fine.  I was hunting for a good smoke meat sandwich in the northend and found this place through Yelp. Excellent sandwich perfectly seasoned tender brisket with just the right amount of fat and juices. They hand carved the meat old school style giving uneven slices which I believe gives great texture profile that a slicing machine with uniform slices can not provide. Sandwich is comparable to anything in Montreal. $10 just for the sandwich. I took it to go so didn't experience anything else from the restaurant. Would have given them 5 stars but then they told me that they don't actually make the meat, it is sent from Montreal and steamed onsite. Atleast it is the real thing!!!!!! Will be back often."}
{"text":"poisoners.

had overpriced lox, onions and eggs [$20! - what the heck was i thinking?] and within half an hour i was needing the bathroom. almost didn't make it home. naseau, chills and well alot of time wishing i hadn't touched the plate."}
{"text":"It took me going to Montreal for the fifth time in order for me to try smoked meat and than finally try it in Thornhill where I grew up

Tried the old fashioned with spicy mustard and while the smoked meat was very good the mustard was just a bit too tangy for me 3.5/5

Got the old fashioned with regular mustard and it was a dream. This place stacks the meat and I was very happy, the regular mustard version gets a solid 4.5/5 

Now someone tell me why I had to go to Montreal to seek out a gem like this which is less than three minutes away from my old block? LOL"}
{"text":"This place is old school Jewish style deli and totally rocks from the friendly waiting staff to better than average food. The smoked meat sandwiches are piled high and served on fresh rye bread. They have hot mustard as an option which was great. We have also tried the Blintzes which are good, the french fries are freshly cut and come out well done. The chicken soup seems fresh and the Kreplach are good. The pasta with meat sauce was not good but I guess who orders pasta at a Jewish deli right?

In summary, stick with the Jewish classics and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a meeting away from my usual haunts at Dixie and Bloor up near the Centre Street Deli so I just had to stop in for a later afternoon lunch.

I had the medium Corned Beef Sandwich with fries, coleslaw and a pickle (I loved the pickle).

The Corned Beef had just the right amount of required fat and the french fries were surprisingly good.

Since I was alone I could not sample everything I wanted to so I ordered some take-out chopped liver with fried onions.  Absolutely to die for on toasted rye.

Nice decor, friendly wait staff and very helpful behind the counter staff."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch based on the yelp reviews (having never eaten here before). Sadly to say, totally unimpressed. Ordered the Deli lunch 'special' to go for $15 plus HST. Received their signature Old Fashioned Deli sandwich which was tiny and just average quality wise. The rest of the platter was all fries that were horrible. I picked away at a few and threw out the rest. Also came with a small side of coleslaw and a quarter pickle. 

Best part of the meal...the $15 quarter pickle. Would recommend anyone trying this place to skip the sides and just try the sandwich. 

As an aside, the interior is very outdated and quite depressing, including the plaza where this place is situated. On the plus side, there's lots of parking available outside (might not be such a good thing if its any indication of what to expect inside)."}
{"text":"I only eat beef when I'm on vacation in Toronto and then I head over here for the smoked meat. Share the large plate with a friend."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat. Order medium fat cuts. Try the spicy mustard. Great takeout deli section."}
{"text":"Came here because someone told me their smoked meat was like Schwartz... it's not. Although I shouldn't judge them based on that. The service was okay... everyone seemed in a rush to get our order but not much rush as we flagged them down for our bill. 

I can barely remember what the sandwich tasted like and it was slightly overpriced with very little meat inside. I'm a little jealous looking at the other pictures of yelper's old fashioned because ours didn't come out like that. The side salad was a good size and the combo came with fries. I'd drop by if I was in the neighborhood and hungry... but definitely wouldn't travel out of my way to grab a sandwich. It's definitely really popular though, maybe I just wasn't feeling it. 

My dining companion really liked it!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food, and, I make sure to visit when I am in the area.  

Kreplach soup w/matzah balls, and pastrami sandwich on rye.  Delish!  Quite an extensive menu if you're not in the mood for traditional deli fare.     

Always busy, but, you can be in and out quick.   Take out also available.  

The service - well - it's a deli.   They're friendly but I go for the food - not the incredible service lol.  

Thank-you for what you do Centre Street!  Hope to see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Great food good prices and great service! There's nothin wrong with going to a traditional old school deli and having yourself a tasty and satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"Service
I went straight to the takeout corner to request a smoke meat sandwich. It did take some time before getting the order though. Paid right there too which is concerning as they are handling food and money? (There was a separate cashier next to the entrance)

Old fashioned med fat smoked meat sandwich $9.75
This was pretty good. There is a good amount of meat that is not too  salty. The sandwich was soft, moist and creamy. The bread was soft but on the small side so it was hard to get a grip on all that meat. The meat was also concentrated at the center of the sandwich which also made it difficult to properly hold and eat. Ordering medium fat, it was not too greasy or overpowering. I noticed that it made for a softer and creamier taste.
Potato latke w/ sour cream $3.75
Looked tasty behind the food case however I don't think it tasted as good as I thought. It was a potato cake with onion and flour and right away, there's this distinct aroma I didn't like. The texture was smooth (not mushy like a potato but more like a fish cake) and it was dense too. The outside was a little crispy but Since they are reheated I'm sure if it were made fresh it could be crispier; or it could also be because the mixture itself that doesn't get as crispy compared to fried hash. The sour cream cut through the grease but didn't really improve the taste for me."}
{"text":"Noisy, busy and delightful Jewish deli complete with sassy waitress.  We had smoked meat sandwiches on rye and they were piled high and had great flavour;  Unexpected star of the meal were the latka.  Almost as big as your hand, crispy on the outside and still moist inside.  The absolute perfect version of this dish -- even better that your Grandma makes."}
{"text":"This is rather late, considering I went in February. But it was memorable enough that my review is still accurate. 

First off, parking is rather difficult considering there isn't much parking and this place is rammed! (There may have been parking in the back, but it was too cold to consider that walk)

We got in and got seated rather quickly. The seats are quite close to one another but you don't really notice until someone's making their way to the washroom and their backside is right by your sandwich. 

From what I gather I got the centre street special (it was beef, that I'm sure of), I paid extra for sweet potato fries. The sandwich was amazing, the fries were amazing, the coleslaw was off the charts. 

My fiancé got the turkey club. He enjoyed it. The only thing that kind of peeved him was their inability to put lettuce on his sandwich. To them it was blasphemy, inappropriate and down right impossible. This was why he ordered the turkey club, because it was one of the only sandwiches that came with lettuce. 

Other than that, it was great. I would pop by again if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"Huge seating area... filled with older regulars. Dated decor. Desserts are nothing special -  wouldn't recommend. Rundown and lazy wait staff... workers behind the counter are a bit better. 

Could definitely make for a good breakfast hangout on a day-to-day basis, though. Has that hole-in-the-wall dîner feel to it. If you're like me, however, you might prefer a more modern and vibrant atmosphere in which case I'd suggest  Jacob's deli down the road.

P.S. Will go back to try the Centre street breakfast special (7am-11am) and the famed old-fashioned Montréal smoked meat sandwich. Hope to try the soups and some Jewish favourites like the kreplah soup and the karnatzel. Will update review...

Update: The Montréal smoked meat is nice, yes, filling yes, but at $15 a pop I'd rather make my own sandwich at home. I'm sorry, I know I may be one of the few who admits this, but I just don't get the hype.

Update: 1 star upgrade for delicious kreplach soup and fresh fries that rival any chip stand! Red house wine is a \"no\", though...very bland."}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars because it is the best deli in the GTA.  And in competition with Canada and Schwartzs.  They hand cut their smoked meat, something most delis have given up on.  And yes hand cut makes it better.  Don't argue this until you try it.
Their beef Knish is the best I've ever had. 
Karnaztel is one of the best meat sticks I've had.
The Chefs Greek Salad is delicious.
The gravy they put on the knish.... Not so much.  It tastes like ass drippings.  They almost lost a star for their gravy, however gravy is optional so I just don't order it."}
{"text":"We had such a great lunch and we were still filled at dinner (yeah no cooking for this gal!). The knish were wonderful, the corned beef was fantastic, the latke was as big as my face and the soup was marvellous. I wanted to go back the next day!"}
{"text":"Being Jewish and having grown up in Thornhill (T-Hill represent! :) yes I just said that) obviously I've eaten here occasionally over the years...and I know that, for deli sandwiches and platters, party sandwiches, chopped liver and the like, this place is better than Pickle Barrel. At peak hours on weekends, people practically line up out the door here. That's because their food is consistent and above-average quality.

So why only 3 stars? I ordered a medium-fat Montreal smoked meat sandwich to-go the other day and was disappointed. The meat was cut way too thick, and the whole sandwich just didn't thrill me.

A tip for deli fans: Katz's on Dufferin is not to be missed."}
{"text":"This place has the best corned in all of Toronto.  I've tried Caplansky who some people say is the best and believe me it doesn't compare to this place.  Their matzo ball soup is also amazing.  Go try.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I LOVE Centre Street Deli! If you're going to eat anything here, try the smoked meat, it's the best in town! My grandmother usually orders the cheese omelette and we also order bagels with cream cheese (which is light, fluffy, and delicious by the way). The interior isn't the best, but the grub certainly makes up for it. They also do catering and take-out, not to mention Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes! :D"}
{"text":"Centre Street Deli is an institution for our family. Three generations at the table, all enjoying high quality food at decent prices. 

Must try items (for me) include the Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich with fries. Make sure you don't order lean. You want nice fat in your smoked meat. I also happen to love their cabbage rolls. For weekend breakfast with the kids, they've pretty much got whatever the little gobblers need. Eggs, pancakes, smoked salmon, etc.

Just a nice place to go and nosh."}
{"text":"Tried their sandwiches party tray at luncheon meeting and knew about this place.  Went there a few times.  Smoked meat sandwich is highly recommended.  Fries is also good!  Friendly service even during busy lunch time."}
{"text":"Oi veh, and had the old Famous smoked meat sandwich, great tasting meat on fresh bread, can't go wrong here. I didn't give 5 stars as the sandwich was on the smaller side and the menu was missing a Ruben."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat outside of Montreal, they uphold the tradition very well!"}
{"text":"amazing breakfast, and even better sandwiches. it's starting to get a little pricey, but still a great meal"}
{"text":"WHAT?!  I haven't reviewed this place???  Shame on me.  I've been eating here for almost 15 years now and I can't believe I haven't gotten around to praising CSD for all its virtues.  Let me tell you guys, the Montreal Smoke Meat here is LOVE.  

Their HAND-CARVED Montreal smoked meat here really steals the show and you can ask them for lean or medium depending on how fatty you want your sandwich to be.  Whoever says Toronto doesn't have a real deli should make their way here.  I've had everything from Latkes, matzo ball soup, lox...with no complaint about any food I've ever received here and that's saying A LOT!  The service is always excellent and the portion size is very very generous.  

If I weren't living so far away from it now, I'd still be here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Amazing smoked meat sandwiches. Wish there was a deli as good in central toronto. we drive 30 minutes up to this one."}
{"text":"Friend took me here. I'm from Houston. I guess I was expecting a little bit more, but it was good none the less.

Our waitress was wonderful. Prompt, attentive, very lovely.  The service was fast!

I ordered a corned beef sandwich with fries. You order separate. No complaints on the pricing what so ever. 

The sandwich was super good, however I've had bigger in New York and believe it or not Houston. The fries were yummy as well.  Usually I take home half my sandwich back home but I devoured all of this one. Meaning it wasn't as much meat as I am accustomed to. 

There is a very large counter service to the side (I didn't walk over to see). I am assuming bagels and sweets. Read other reviews or go to the website to find out more."}
{"text":"Cutest deli with the nicest servers :)  Apparently this is very close to the deli sandwiches you get at Schwartz's in Montreal, and while I haven't been, the juiciness of the roast brisket leaves me little room for debate

Can you say yum?  The deli sandwiches come with great coleslaw and thick cut fries.  The meats come with a choice of lean or medium; I ordered the corn beef in lean since the server suggested that corn beef is naturally fattier.  However, when I had it, it lacked flavour and the meat was not the least bit juicy.  The saving grace though was the beef brisket we also ordered - in medium.  The meat was definitely fattier but SO flavourful and juicy.  There's  ridiculous amount of meat in these sandwiches and do not fear that you won't be full after you get through one of these combos.  

This deli makes one appreciate kosher foods more - who needs pork when beef tastes this good?"}
{"text":"This is my parents' favorite place and they have been going there for years. When I was younger, I really didn't like it - I would tell my parents \"why wouldn't we go to real restaurant?\" :-)
Well, now I started liking this place more and more, may be it's nostalgia or may be my tastes have changed..."}
{"text":"The only thing that blew us away were the potato latska, which were amazing and I would pick up for take out again. Our $50 late breakfast didn't live up to the price; I had the Old Fashion (Smoked meat) sandwich which was quite literally meat on rye bread, and he opted the steak and eggs breakfast which wasn't disappointing but for the price it didn't reflect in the quantity or quality)"}
{"text":"Best and one of the last great Deli's in the GTA. 

Classic in so many ways from the and cut meat to the classic sandwiches that we have all grown to love. 

Everything from the smoked meat, to the breakfast, it is a heart warming place to visit. 

I hope that this landmark in Thornhill lasts another 30+ years. 

I love coming for the lunch special with house cut fries and my choice of meat on Rye bread. 


Nothing better. 

Must visit it you are in the area."}
{"text":"Basically, after my trip to Montreal, when it comes to MSM sandwiches, I use Schwartz's as the benchmark.  Centre Street Deli is the closest I've found to that benchmark here in TO.

Pros: 
Very good sandwiches, as good as it gets in TO
Friendly service

Cons:
A bit pricey 

I was craving a MSM sandwich so I came by here with the gf on a weekday I was off from work for lunch.  The place is huge.  The place is divided into 2 sections.  There's a large dining section and a takeout/deli section as well.

We both got the Old Fashioned combo which comes with fries and a coleslaw.  The sandwich was excellent.  Like I said earlier, it's as close at it gets to Montreal in my opinion here in TO.  The meat is all hand sliced too.  The fries were pretty standard, not too bad, not too great.  I've never been a fan of coleslaw so I won't review that part.

The servers were all very nice.  I had way too much meat (good thing) and the server didn't hesitate to get me some more slices of bread.  The place is huge but they had more than enough servers to make sure service ran smoothly. 

My only gripe is the price.  Lunch for 2 here will run you about $35-40.  For some it may be hard to pay that for sandwiches, albeit very good ones.  I will come back but only when I'm absolutely craving some smoked meat."}
{"text":"Tried the Turkey Pastrami sandwich with fries and coleslaw. Definitely worth the price of admission though I think they offer some more interesting and tasty dishes that I will try next time if I'm there. Also, the turkey didn't taste as much like pastrami as I hoped, but more a good smoked turkey sandwich.

While there I also tried my girlfriend's Greek Salad, which is quite large and definitely a meal in itself. If you are looking to eat a bit healthier, and still feel full, this is the choice you should make. And it is quite tasty too!

A couple other standout dishes I saw at our table were the Gefilte Platter, and the Pickled Salmon. The Gefilte Platter comes with potato salad, coleslaw, and a bunch of other salad type things. And the pickled salmon also looked pretty interesting, and the portion of salmon was actually quite large. If you are looking for a seafood dish, I would recommend those two.

Also, on the way out we were looking at the counter of desserts and other foods, and the cheese bagels and latkas looked amazing. I had never seen such big, thick and beautiful latkas in my life. I kind of want to go back right now and order a bunch of them for takeout so I can try them all."}
{"text":"I wonder whether the owner has changed, they are dropping the ball or we arrived on an off night and hit by a series of mishaps.

Here goes:

We arrived at seven o'clock and were told they close at seven-thirty and it won't be enough time for them to serve and for us to dine. It has to be take-out then. Who closes at seven-thirty? Is it a reflection of their older clientele? Why could they not take an order at seven, allow us time to eat and perhaps lock up at eight? Surely, we would be done by then!

As you can imagine, taking out a sandwich and fries to home and eating them cold is not ideal.
They were out of old-fashioned. That being their main meat and meal it was a particular disappointment. The cashier: \"it's all the same. There is no difference.\" I assume she was just trying to console us; otherwise, that makes no sense and is quite an admission if true. We ordered mild to go, as there was no choice, which is lighter instead.
We, at least, saved o the tip!

Their sandwich has definitely shrunk. Both the bread and meat have seen a palpable decrease in size. Tonight the sandwich was small and plain. A 'special' which is a small sandwich, lots of French Fries (cold once we arrived home!) and a coleslaw with a pickle was $15 each.

Finally, and this is a deal breaker. They have a photo of Stephen harper with (who I assume to be the owners) in front of the entrance. I seriously will not come back. It reminds one of the bad old days when the Canadian dollar was down, we were bombing the Middle East illegally (without those countries' permission), Canadians were pitted against each other (racism and xenophobia is ugly, folks) and we were the only G7 country in a recession (2014). Why would a restaurant show off an association with a bonker criminal? And why would I want to eat there? I don't."}
{"text":"Got old fashioned smoked meat sammich to go again. Wow, noticeably smaller than what I'm used to for a smoked meat sandwich. It looks really full in the centre of the sandwich but it was sparse on the backside. Sandwich was 9.75$+tax. Very delicious. Packed with a lot of great flavour. Though I found it fattier than usual today. Freshly sliced and was hot in the take out bag. 

Also tried their potato latke+sour cream for 3.75$+tax. Didn't like it much, was too dense imo. It nearly broke my plastic knife when I tried to cut it up. Yikes."}
{"text":"This place set the corned beef bar for me, and since I was a kid it hasn't been beat. I've been to delis in New York and Montreal, Centre Street keeps me coming back. The thick-cut juicy meat, fresh and aromatic bread, and home style Jewish delicacies are a force to be reckoned with. Whenever I have a craving for some old school deli classics this is where I turn."}
{"text":"The Centre Street Deli is quite far from where I live, but it is a convenient location for my friend Regina, so I meet her at Downsview station and she drives us over. 

I have been to the Centre Street Deli twice now, and the first time I fell in love with their potatoes. I specially loved the seasoning. I also ordered a bagel with my breakfast and it was delicious. It was warm with melted butter. 

I really wanted to return for more potatoes and bagels, and we finally made it back last month. Argh, and this is what I hate. I hate getting excited about eating something you loved in the past again, and having it taste totally different. The 2nd time around the potatoes were not very well seasoned and they were still hard. So sad. The bagel still tasted delicious though. 

Both times we liked the service and the free coffee refills. 

Considering the trek we have to make to visit this establishment, I have no plans on returning."}
{"text":"Authentic Jewish deli with yummy Montreal smoked meat...distant cousin of pastrami . Very tasty, nice smooth smoky taste.

Vegetable latka was the size of a head. Homemade and fresh.

Now the lox and cream cheese sandwich 5/5. Quality lox with an appropriate pairing of cream cheese. Served with tomato slices on the side which I added along with a dash of pepper. So yummy."}
{"text":"Of all the well-known deli restaurants in Toronto, Centre Street beats all of them hands-down. I have been coming here since I was a kid (enjoying the weiners and beans) and have yet to find a Jewish Montreal-style deli that can stack up. I'm partial to the corned beef, beef knishes (made with corned beef) and their enormous Greek salad (one of the two owners is Greek himself). The atmosphere is very casual, yet clean and inviting at the same time. Prices are reasonable especially when you consider the sandwich plates include fries, coleslaw, and a dill. If you want real, Montreal deli fare, it's worth the trip north to Centre Street Deli. For the early-birds they do a good breakfast as well (including the secret taboo, bacon)."}
{"text":"I went to the Centre Street Deli a week ago and must say that this is authentic Montreal.  With its roots deeply linked to the Snowdon Deli located in Montreal, it brings me home.

Ordered the smoked meat, fries, coleslaw and dill.  Of course, the required Cott black cherry cola to wash it down.

This place was packed on a Sunday afternoon and they do a brisk business because they are not just good...they are very good.

I will definitely come back to try the other yummy deli treats.

{"text":"I like my pastrami sandwiches like I like my men - old fashioned, spicy, and with lean meat.

My husband was the one who ordered the pastrami. Getting it \"old fashioned\" is the way to go here because it is spicier, and he specified lean meat. He was quite pleased with the way it turned out.

Centre Street Deli is a Montreal-style deli and specializes in Montreal-style smoked meats. I didn't even know there were Jews in Montreal. (Since they're a people who have historically wandered the desert, I thought Toronto was the farthest northern reach of the wild North American Hebrew.) Another thing special about this place is that they carry a special, rarely seen type of black cherry soda.

Our table started with a salad, which was fine, but it was just drowning in dressing. They even brought extra dressing on the side in case we wanted to waterboard it again. 

I had a cup of the matzoh ball soup ($3.50?). They really need to get some larger cups. My ball *just* barely fit in the cup. Unfortunately for my husband, his ball got sheared off on the bottom to fit. (That sentence does not sound good on its own.) We held up the ball to do a scientific investigation, thereby discovering the ball shearing. The soup was tied for the best with D.Z. Akin's in San Diego for the best matzoh ball soup I've ever had in a restaurant. It was good stuff. 

I followed that with a potato knish ($3?), which was really good. They even had spicy hot mustard on hand. It wasn't Beaver's brand (which I love so much I've thought about carrying it with me to restaurants - I love me some Beaver), but it was very comparable. 

I was pretty full by then, but that didn't stop me from helping eat an order of three potato latkes ($8.50?) that came to the table. These were the thickest latkes I'd ever seen. That's a good thing because they were really tasty, and the thickness kept them from being fried beyond recognition. They were THE MOST PERFECT LATKES I'VE EVER EATEN.

This is my favorite restaurant from my two visits to Toronto. One more visit and it has a strong chance of usurping the number one position on the list below.

{"text":"My grandfather was Jewish, i am from Montreal, so i like my smoked meat sandwiches and matzo ball soup. The legend is that this place is owned by the long lost descendants of the ever famous Snowdon deli in Montreal.  Smoked meat, medium fat, matzo ball soup, oh, and i will take a kilo to go for my mother!"}
{"text":"For some reason, Centre Street has languished on my Yelp To Do list since the day I started contributing to the site. 

And yet it's hard to put my feelings about the deli into words. 

As ex-Montrealers will tell you, Centre Street is the city`s sole purveyor of authentic Montreal Smoked Meat. What they might not tell you is that the good, real stuff is properly hand-cut, medium Old-Fashioned. The regular stuff has that chemical, pencil-eraser quality I can`t stand in mass-Market deli. What they should tell you is that there`s really only one thing to order here. Said sandwich, slathered with sinus-clearing hot mustard, done up combo style with perfectly crisp, golden fries, a bowl ow sweet-sour-oily coleslaw and pickles. Bonus points for the pickled pepper resting atop the slaw. Want something to drink--have a Cott`s black cherry soda. Or two. It`s the deli version of fine wine. 

The meat itself falls prey to the inconsistency that dogs delis across Toronto. On a good day, it`s melt-in-your-mouth goodness, livened by its spiced exterior and smoked to the point of addictiveness. When the bread is fresh and properly cut (seriously, they have a bad habit of positioning the slices at 90 degrees to each other which seems a violation of Sandwichcraft 101), it`s a perfect storm of meat; almost (ALMOST, for my Quebecer friends) as good as the sandwich a few hours east. When it`s bad, it`s tough, or chewy, and the fat congeals rather than melts. Fries are plagued by the same misfires; ideally they shatter with crispiness, and yield to a fluffy interior. Sometimes they`re just stodgy and undersalted. 

Other menu highlights include a decent julienne salad and a club sandwich made with real (if sometimes dry) roast turkey and a decent amount of burnt-crispy bacon. Deduct a point or two for the li`l packets of kraft mayo on the side. I like my sandwich to come fully assembled, thank you very much. Kishke is a tad dry inside, and the casings are beyond tough. Verenikes with caramelized onions are pure doughy comfort food, and potato or kasha knishes provide a day`s worth of salty carby goodness. Im^portant when your only other starches are sandwich bread, fries and soda. 

I avoid matzo ball soups in delis; an expression of the Jewish soul, real chicken soup relies on complex flavours from tonnes of aromatics and good bird broth, with light, carefully made dumplings. It does not translate well when you rely on soup base and slapdash rolling techniques, like most delis do. Still, it`s hot and wet,  which counts for something. 

I likewise don`t frequent delis for dessert; some swear by dry and crumbly poppy seed cookies. I`m more of a rugalach man; especially where chocolate is involved. 

Coffee is standard-issue-try to time it so you get a fresh pot and you`ll be fine. Send it back if it`s grey. As part of an awesome breakfast special, it`s tough to go wrong. 

Service is generally friendly; coffee is warmed up and refilled on demand, and you`re never rushed. 

Now, if only I didn`t have to trek to the wilds of Thornhill for my fix."}
{"text":"Centre Street Deli has been a staple in this area for many years. And there's a good reason for that. It has great deli and all its food`s are very tasty. Good, quick service. Friendly, helpful staff. The take out counter has a great selection of items. You really cant go wrong here. A little pricey, but you pay for what you get.
I heard that the owners have sold this place to the staff. I am hoping that they will continue with the consistent, good eats, that this restaurant was built on. Time will tell."}
{"text":"This may be one of the best delis in the city.  All the meat sandwiches are great.  The smoked meat is excellent.  The chopped liver fantastic.  The menu is diverse, with lots of options from lighter salads to breakfast food to heavier meat dishes.  This place serves both dairy and meat.  

I love this place, and I try to come often, but \"oy vey iz mir\" why so far from downtown?"}
{"text":"I have always wanted good quality Montreal style smoked meat closer to home. Today I found it! We ordered a platter of old fashioned smoked meat and it was at least a worthy opponent to Schwartz's. The coleslaw was the best I've had in a while.  The chopped liver was great--and this comes from someone who doesn't like eating organ meat. The matzo and latke were both good."}
{"text":"Seemingly unchanged since inception, this place feels and smells like the home of the Bubbe and Zayde I would have had if I was Jewish. It's a dang shame that Centre Street Deli is as good as it gets when it comes to Jewish Delis in Toronto. I have to face the facts, there's just no place for a fan of Deli in this city.

We ordered a medium smoked meat on rye, a cold tongue sandwich, kishka and cabbage roll. The smoked meat, stacked high, was super fatty. My friend really enjoyed the tongue sandwich. The kishka was a new territory for both of us. Despite the overly phallic appearance, the intestinal casing stuffed with meat and matzo meal had a pretty nice texture and consistency. The same goes for the cabbage roll but nothing really new there. The missing link across all the dishes was taste. Salt, spice, some form of flavour. We were desperate! The waitress was sweet enough to bring us a mini jar of super hot Keen's mustard. I was also pretty bummed about not getting a pickle with my sandwich.

The service was amazing. Our server was very friendly and even made assumptions on what we would and wouldn't like in a nice motherly way."}
{"text":"I agree that the Montreal smoked meat at Centre Street is delicious & mouth-watering. I was there this week with my two grown sons. I hadn't been there in about six months. I am from Montreal so do agree with all the former reviews that it is authentic Montreal smoked meat. I also love it!

But,for me the prices are totally outrageous. For the three of us with  drinks & tax & tip it is well over at least $55, Sorry,I am in the \"99%\" and find this to be  very bad value. For us, the coleslaw is and has always been putrid. To get the sandwich on double rye,i t is another $1.50. 

I won't be going to Centre street deli in the near future for sure. 

And to take out a few pounds of smoked meat or other meats cost  at least $31 without tax ,as it is $15.50 per pound.This is crazy. It's good smoked meat but not made of gold!
If you don't mind spending a lot for lunch or dinner that's fine. For us,our plates held mostly french fries and tiny pieces of rye which could hardly hold the meat."}
{"text":"Meat........Fatty and Hand Cut Smoked Meat.........

I just love my quickie lunch experience at Centre Street Deli. 

Great and attentive services! Yes here at a Deli!
- Greeted and seated right when I walked in!
- Ordered taken immediately
- Checked on a few times and waiter ensure I have everything I needed
- I said I want mustard... I was offered 4 different kinds!
- Water glasses always topped up! 

Medium Fatty Smoked Meat Sandwiches ($7.95) is AWESOME! The smoked meat was hot and melt in your mouth tender... and full of flavours too. The coleslaw ($2.95) is light and refreshing went so well with my meat...

I was in and out of the restaurant within 20 minutes and at peak lunch hour when the Centre Street Deli was at its full capacity!!

I love the deco here too. Simple, traditional and with the old day charm.

Now I know where to get my piece of meat when I am in the area!! And the more I think about it, I think I will even drive here when I am not in the area!"}
{"text":"Juicy, handcarved smoked meat that melts in your mouth. Platter for two seemed small (compared to schwartz and how filled we were). 

When you walk in, take out area is to the right and theres a large seating area to the left.

All in all, great deli uptown but i feel they can work on their portions."}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef sandwich in Ontario. Fantastic family vibe. Bumping most days of the week. Seriously on par with Schwartz's. Kills caplanskys. The potato latkes are heaven. With sour cream and apple sauce. Mmmmmm. 

The servers are great. A must try if you live in Toronto or GTA. Great coleslaw. Love the pickles. Fries are nice and brown. 

Don't forget the Keens hot mustard on your sandwich!"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Montreal, someone suggested to visit this place as they had authentic Montreal Smoke meat.

This place was hustling and bustling with people even at two o'clock in the afternoon and rightfully so because it's a great place to grab a quick bite with the menu offering so much. On the right hand side of the diner, there is also a take-out section.

I ordered the Centre Street special that had my smoked meat sandwich coupled with fries and coleslaw ($13.50, a bit pricey). Upon my first bite, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. Just like how I remember it!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat west of Montreal - doesn't hurt that the original owner was from Montreal I guess. Nothing comes close in the GTA."}
{"text":"Ordered two Old Fashioned Smoked Meat sandwiches. 

It was a little on the pricier side for the portion but the quality of the meat was excellent. Definitely one of the better sandwiches I've had in Toronto. Also a good idea to ask for their hot mustard if you want a little kick to the sandwich. 

Service was great from our waitress but at some point, we sensed a little tension amongst the other waitresses because one of them yelled at another. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"A wonderful example of a true deli. The staff have have been there for a while and are extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the food. The smoked meat sandwich there is by far the best on the menu and probably in the GTA. A side of the split pea soup will satisfy those brunch and lunch needs. With free refills on your coffees, it's an awesome spot for a date or to just hang out with some friends."}

Great place to pick up a pound of medium old fashioned smoke meat, some rye, coleslaw, potato salad, a small bucket of chicken soup and a couple matzoballs!  A veritable family feast!
I've eaten at the restaurant, however, take out seems to work better for me.  More economical too.  Those sandwich combos can add up quick."}
{"text":"I like this place. We went on a Sunday morning at 11.  There's a big parking area, lots of free parking.  

This place doesn't look that big from the outside but when you get in, its huge!  And really busy. So come early.

 I got the club roll. Which is also Cheryl's favourite. Not sure who Cheryl is but based on her favourite sandwich I like her!!

So the club roll is described as assorted meat grilled on a hamburger bun.  It comes with fries  and Cole slaw.

When I ordered it the server said its all the meat. Yum!

All the meat. All the meat.

So it came. The meat was grilled on the flat top, which made it great tasting.  The bun was soft and fresh, seemed like it might have been made that morning.

It tasted great. I completely understand why this is Cheryl's favourite!

The fries were great. Just the way I like them. Cooked and slightly soft.  Cole slaw tasted fresh and like spring.  Not cream based but not sour vinegar that you tend to get. 

Next time I'm getting this again. 

Note: they have an area where you can buy premade food, take out, breads, treats, cakes."}

Almost a year ago when my boyfriend and I started dating we'd go to all of his Italian dinners and restaurants and I was like okay okay it's time for you to experience the most delicious food MY culture has to offer. It was then that I introduced him to his very first matzah ball soup and deli sandwich (obviously he's had deli sandwiches before but not from Centre Street Deli!)

Obviously he loved it, who wouldn't?

Their matzah balls are legit the size of baseballs. GO HUNGRY!! I also always get their soup to go when I'm sick or just in the mood for some bomb ass chicken soup that comes second to my bubby's (obvs) 

Honestly the only things I order there are matzah ball soup and deli sandwiches, usually corned beef, so I can't really recommend anything else, but I'm sure it's all great.

But you definitely can't go wrong with that order and you'll leave stuffed!

We also sometimes get their deli meats to go..mmmmm mmmm cannot go wrong. They melt in your mouth.

I don't come here often but when I do it's always a treat! Especially when Bubby pays the bill :)"}
