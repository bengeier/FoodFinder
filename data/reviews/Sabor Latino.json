{"text":"Amazing place!! The food is so tasty it's unbelievable. We tries every items on their menu and fell in love with the place!! A+++ for taste & $$$"}
{"text":"Wow, just bumbed into this Latin American Supermarket. A single location for everything  needed to prepare your favourite dishes including corn flour for tamales, an unlimited selections of hard to find dried chiles, frozen giant-grained Mayan corn, different types of soft shell tacos, all the meat cuts you need, vegetables and then some. Last, there are also some tasty prepared mexican, argentine, columbia and peruvian meals To Go!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, but it's a big mess, no place to sit down, should wait for More than 1 hour."}
{"text":"Une épicerie-restaurant qui goûte bon les saveurs de l'Amérique latine !   Côté dégustation, laissez-vous emporter sous l'équateur par les tamales (petits pâtés de farine de maïs fourrés cuits dans une feuille de maïs), les arepas vénézuéliennes, les bananes plantains, les haricots noirs et les frites de yuca. J'y ai retrouvé le bon goût des épices qui m'avaient ensorcelé les papilles lors de mon voyage au Pérou.   Côté épicerie, on s'envole pour le Mexique ou des pays plus lointains avec de nombreuses sauces, des sodas exotiques et des piments en tous genres.  Une belle adresse pour se dépayser et se réchauffer au cur de l'hiver. Sabor latino porte décidément bien son nom !"}
{"text":"If you pass this store front restaurant and decide to give it a pass, you will have made a hugely regrettable mistake.  Look for the free off street parking at the end of the building and prepare to be delighted by great and flavorful food that is very inexpensive.  Behind that storefront door you'll find new decor and upholstery, a full bar, and a dining room cleaner than your Mama's (even if she was OCD!)  The menu offers a variety of Mexican staples, plus some Central American and Cuban menu items.  There are ala carte items as well as dinners, and discounted daily specials.  My first visit, I tried almost one of everything from the ala carte menu: papusa, sope, gordita, and soft taco (ALL on homemade HANDMADE corn tortillas.  Some items were new to me, names I'd often seen on food truck menus but never tried.  My favorites were the gordita al pastor and the alhambre taco. Believe it or not, I returned the next night and tried the Big Burrito special (steak) for $4.99 and was presented the most artful (Japanese genes sneaked into someone's Hispanic lineage??) and tastefully presented burrito platter I had ever seen (and it tasted better than it looked!).  I also ordered the \"small\" size guacomole for $2.50, expecting a dollop but got an bowl of delicious GUAC and almost had trouble finishing it! (... but avocado lover that I am, I persevered to the end!) It's a local, family-owned enterprise that deserves your business.  And you definitely deserve what they're dishing at Sabor Latino!!"}
{"text":"Endroit super typique, un vrai voyage! Ce que j'aime le plus c'est qu'on y retrouve des spécialités de plusieurs pays d'Amérique du Sud. Tous les classiques faits maison sous un même toit! De la bouffe de maman et de grand-maman pour un réconfort assuré.  Les portions sont plus que généreuses et les prix plus que raisonnables.  Vous serez complètement rassasié à peu de frais.  Ce que je préfère: les pupusas faites sur commande, le buf effiloché, le porc frit, les haricots noirs, les bananes plantains mûres avec de la crème et bien sûr les churros.  Informez-vous des plats du jour qui sont aussi délicieux!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem in this city. Right when I walked in, I was transported to a local deli in NYC. Everything here is fantastic. I highly recommend the Colombian empanadas with meat and potatoes, the chorizo tacos and the fresh squeezed passion fruit juice. In the back they even sell Hispanic produce, snacks, and groceries. The staff is super friendly and warm. Love this low-key, under the radar place!! Can't rave enough about how bomb the food is."}
{"text":"Belle variété de produit latino-américains. Fruits, légumes, légumineuses, riz, salsa, tortillas, piments et sauces picantes. Aussi repas préparés. À deux pas du marché Jean-Talon. À découvrir!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and amazing range in selection. The cafeteria food is outstanding and authentic. Very happy to hear that Sabor Latino will be expanding to a newer and larger location."}
{"text":"Great Latino supermarket/bakery and restaurant, which also does takeout, and CHEAP. I often come here to get baked goods or just will go to the restaurant side for  delicious, generously-portioned meal. Again, this is also very reasonably-priced and very satisfying. Here is where one can find all sorts of Latino groceries and spices as well as packaged goods. Love the place!"}
{"text":"Mi comentario es respecto a la tienda, no he comido todavía ahí. Pero la tienda vale bastante la pena, se encuentran bastantes cosas que dificilmente se encontraran en un super mercado"}
{"text":"What a fantastic discovery!  This is a south American heaven. There are three parts to this place. A butcher who had beautiful cuts of meats. A supermarket with tons of authentic south American products, not that Old El Paso crap. And finally a restaurant.   The restaurant has a variety of scrumptious dishes, all of which can be for take out. This is more of a fast food place, not a proper sit down restaurant with service.   I played the dummy that I am and the staff was eager to answer my questions. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best food ever and its all home made. Latin American world in Montreal everything in one place: food, bakery, butcher, groceries.  Colombian Empanadas are amazing. Everything is just amazing..that's why its always packed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good. I wish they had more variety of deserts but it's very good. I will be back. I love authentic food"}
{"text":"Latino bottega, meat shop, bakery & restaurant. All under one roof. If you close your eyes and open upon entering you could imagine you are in El Barrio in east Harlem. The grocery store is small packed but has many if not all of the ingredients needed for a Latin inspired recipe or meal. As other have mentioned the bakery is pretty unbelievable. Churros, buns, cookies, cakes and so many tasty sweet items. The butcher shop has some different cuts and I noticed Mexican chorizo sausages and even Colombian chorizo. Plus many other different cuts that your Metro or IGA would not have. They did have an excellent selection of fresh tortas and tortillas. Mostly corn ones but I did see some wheat based also in different sizes. I walked over to the restaurant and it was too busy for me to discover but it looked like they had fresh steamed tamales and the smell was one of cornmeal and pork in the resto. It smelled amazing. Just as your mouth salivating feeling as a running faucet.....l amazing!   I must come back and take more time to discover earlier in the day!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for empanadas, so I decided to check out Sabor Latino near Jean-Talon.  I chose a Colombian beef empanada and a Chilean beef empanada.  Both were underwhelming.      The filling of the Colombian one was bland and dry.   The fritter itself was not very hot nor very crispy.     The filling of the Chilean one was not very flavorful and the dough was dry.   With lots of kneaded dough on the edges...which made it too dry and bland.  Overall not a place I'd go back for empanadas."}
{"text":"This out of the way spot has the most incredible Mexican/Central American food you will find in the Concord/Charlotte area.  If you want \"real\" traditional Mexican food, this is the place to come!  I have been looking for a place like this since I moved from Raleigh 5 months ago.  The staff was great and willing to go over the Spanish only menu if you needed.  I don't speak Spanish but can make my way around a menu!  You have no idea what you are missing!!!!"}
{"text":"Je viens ici depuis que je suis tout petit. Les odeurs de pains sucré et de plats typiques latino nous accueillent. Avec une boucherie dans le fond du commerce, on ressort de cet endroit avec tout ce qu'il faut pour concocter un souper exotique. Il y même des pigñatas à vendre suspendu au plafond. Avant de reprendre la route quoi de mieux que de faire une petite halte au resto afin de faire le plein de bonne bouffe authentique!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Mexican food items. Love their assortment of dried chillies. Good quality for fresh staples like tomatillos and poblano peppers. I also really like their queso fresco and Mexican fruit juices and sodas. I even bought my cast iron tortilla press there. Thankful of their existence in the 514!"}
