{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. Poor service and horrible food.Ordered food that took forever and just was awful. If they don't know you in there you are not made to feel welcome and the bartenders are very rude. Save your money, not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Ah, the Roo. I've recently found myself here more frequently on Saturday nights. Pretty diverse crowd for McKeesport/White Oak. The people watching is worth the trip!! Bartenders are always nice, and always ready to refill or help you with the menu.  Personally, I'm into wings right now. Theirs are always crispy and the sauces are spot on. They have a Buffalo Chicken dip they serve with soft pita, and it's really good. I could just eat the pita that they coat in parmesan, it's that good!!  They frequently have live entertainment, bands and DJ's. Recently, they added a VIP area that you can get into for an additional cover charge."}
{"text":"So I have been coming here since I started my job near by. This is definitely a local bar where townees do come in and get their drinks and food. I have never felt out of place. The bartenders tend to their customers very well. The location of the bar is not in the best of parts. Their road is full of pot holes so please be careful of those.   The Food is great. I love their fries and their Roo Chicken sandwich. They have a great menu and great wings. Each day they have a special on their food and drinks. I really like this bar because every Thursday they have a DJ present and great dirnk specials. i would come to this bar if you just want to get out the house for a  little bit. By all means, do not dress up to this bar. This is come in your jeans and a shirt and you will be fine. I have brought a few of my friends here and they do like it. It is not the FIRST choice on the list, but if we want to go drink and have good food and not have to worry about spending a lot of money... We know we can go there."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for months, I decided to give it a try, and I was very impressed. The sweet potato waffle fries had the just right amount of seasoning to deliver bold flavor without being overpowering and making condiments unnecessary. The Roo Pizza exceeded my expectations, and I took half of it home to share with my family. I will be going back!"}
