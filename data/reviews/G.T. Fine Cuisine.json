{"text":"Decor was really nice in here.  Most hot pot places are generally very messy and the meat, for the most part, are semi frozen.    This place was a little different, the beef was not bad.  They had this malay spicy beef which got me a little excited.   Other than the spicy beef, nothing really stood out here.  Veggies, other meats and soups were pretty much the same.  The clay pot rice was not really clay pot style.  Just regular rice in a clay pot.  You also had to pay for drinks here, whereas other places, no charge.  They had a good selection of a la cart items but they were pretty expensive  (especially when they are charging $23.99 already).  For dessert, only ice cream was offered. Unlike other places, they had real Chinese dessert.   Will i come back... just can't.  As nice as the place is, i rather head down street and go to \"kam tao\"."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Nice Decor - individual pots  Cons: - Terrible Service - Small portions - Pricey - controls for individual pots are terrible  Will I go again? No  Notes: The only 2 servers on a Tuesday night spoke only Mandarin. Our table tried to order in English and again in Cantonese and even pointed at the menu for the sauces that we wanted but even though our server nodded and we thought he understood our order, It did not come as ordered.   The heating for the individual pots are sporadic at best.  The power levels range from 1-9 where anything over 3 and over will boil over and 1-2 will just not bring the pot to a boil in a reasonable amount of time.  Solution? eat with 1 hand and keep the other hand on the temperature control.  Had to ask a couple of times to get our tea refilled and the food came out super slow (there were only 3 other tables in the restaurant).  Since the food came out so slow and the portion sizes were so small we tried to order a few orders at a time so they would just bring more each time but the servers did not understand when we asked for multiple orders of something.  Final review:  I did not think that a Hot Pot place could be this disappointing but this restaurant has proved me wrong.  This is the first time I have ever left a Hot Pot establishment while still hungry.  If you speak Mandarin, maybe your experience will be better than ours.  Bottom Line: Will I ever go back again? Definitely not."}
{"text":"We had a table of 12. The place is very nice and the air is very open and clean. The meat look fresh. The service was good. This is about the good as it get.  The down side now is the stove that we use really stress is out. There are 8-9 level of heat. Once you put it to level 3 the water boil out of the pot. We had individual hot pot. If you out it in level 2 it too slow . So everyone we cook something we had to watch and adjust the switch. It just a pain while eating and cooking. The vegetable greens wasn't really fresh. I wasn't happy with the soup base. Beside clear soup everything cost extra. Lot is other choices cost extra. You get one drinks and then it cost money. So really this isn't a cheap place to hot pot."}
{"text":"GT was an ayce hotpot that had limited selection. Their special broth was not that great. They put too much anise seed imo and we had to pay an extra 3 dollars for that. Out of all the selections, the spicy beef and dumpling, I thought was the best choice. The rest was ok. There were a lot of choices that you have to pay extra. I didn't particularly like that too much. It actually annoys me more than anything. What's the point of putting an ayce if you cannot have ayce? Service was also not good. I had ordered duck gizzard three times. It never came. We asked for the bill and there was a long delay. We ended up going up to them for the bill. The place wasn't even busy. There was one customer aside from us. The two servers were just sitting idle chatting with each other. The only saving grace is the decor. It was nice and I did like the fact that each person had their own hotpot. Either way, definitely not coming back."}
