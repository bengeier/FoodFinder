{"text":"The restaurant was setting up for a sound check and I had great difficulty talking to the owners because of this.  I guess they have karaoke every night and on Sundays there is a dance teacher that comes in to teach whomever so brave how to do the Salsa.  You pay simply 5 dollars, have something to eat and learn the ways that your body can or cannot move.  MFGAP has tons of crowd pleasing tricks up its sleeve; they have celebrity Filipino guests coming in to perform for their cliental this February 11th to commemorate Valentine's Day.  Tickets are on sale for $30 and this is for a 5 course meal.  The owners seem to be a husband and wife team and they are both friendly and inspired and if I am not mistaken their father is the cook.   The place is a big space, complete with dance floor, disco lights and an obviously very loud sound system.    Their menu is East meets West, they want to appeal to the non- Filipino crowd as well, but they do serve up traditional delights like Pansit, Adobo, and Fried Fish.  You can even have your private birthday celebration here as well, depending on how many courses, you can have a package deal that includes a bottomless pop beverage and sing to your heart's content. MFGAP, one of the few larger Filipino restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 Decor: 3/5 Parking: 3/5 Kitchen Speed: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Value: 3/5  This is less a restaurant that has karaoke and more of a karaoke bar that happens to serve food.  Good food.  The caldaretta was excellent and the waitresses were quick to refill our glasses.  Price is on the steep side though."}
{"text":"i love this joint.  so filipino in so many ways.  it's basically a pub setup with a stage, which is utilized for either a live band (i think typically weekend nights) or for when people want to sing karaoke.  there is ALWAYS someone singing, which can be either a good or bad thing depending on your taste.  there is a center dance floor where people dance to the live music (salsa/rumba ballroom style) or to electro dance music complete with lasers flashing.  the food is very good value for the price, some very authentic filipino cuisine such as pancit and grilled bangus (milk fish) or your standard grill fare.  i asked if there were more filipino dishes that weren't on the menu available and we also tried the pork adobo.  being the adventurous foodie type, i was hoping there would be balut available (don't look it up if you're squeamish), but no dice."}
