{"text":"Went to Kimbob cafe  today March 13, 2013, it was a pleasant surprise. Kimbob is located on a small strip on mall on the North side of the 20, you can see the sign from the highway. We have passed by this place many times and it was always closed as they only served breakfast and lunch and closed at 3.00PM, so we never got a chance to try this place. Two weeks ago the decided to open for supper and it it a good thing for the west island.

I had some kimchee it was good and marinated not the fresh kind some places serve. We had Bibim Bab  and Jabche both were extremely tasty. This is a family run business so you know its going to be authentic with a Korean cook. Their home made chili sauce is also very tasty. If you are not sure what you want ask KC, he is very helpful and will guide you through the menu.

I like it, in fact I like it very much and will be going back quite often. Please go and support this lovely little gem in Dorval, I'd like to keep this to myself, but west islanders need a good tasty Korean restaurant and this is definitely one to share.

-------
I have been back to Kimbob cafe over a dozen times and have covered the menu and I am starting all over again. 

Great food."}

{"text":"Really good food and lovely polite and kind service. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  I'm from Toronto and I must say the kalbi beef ribs was amazing.  Served homemade Kimchi and fresh green tea.  Definitely a diamond in the rough.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The place was clean. I found the best feature the service they provide :) The waitress explains the foods and she makes sure you are satisfied with your choice... So if you would like to try Korean food for the first time or you are not that familiar with the cuisine, try the place... 
I saw many regulars ordering their usuals... It was impressive..."}
{"text":"What a treasure! This place was a delight to find.  I am a Korean and passed by here on vacation with my family from the US.  Saw this place near the hotel and decided to give it a try. What a pleasant surprise.  It is not your traditional Korean food, but it is not far from it.  The chef and owner puts his own little twist on the dishes to make them his own and it works out perfectly.  Was not disappointed at all.  Interior was very neat and had a cozy feel to it.  Would HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"An under the radar kind of place. Even my picky eater kids loved everything. We wish this place was back in our home town in states. My husband had steaming saut√©ed beef that started with a delicious salad. Kids had steak and general Tsao's. I had the best bowl of chicken and beef with veggies and salad that I've ever had. To top it off the green tea fried ice cream and cheesecake we shared were succulent. Everything was fresh and reasonably priced too. Definitely go there!"}
{"text":"Amazing food I was so nervous because u went in late just before closing there was no customers and the food was AMAZING staff is nice and I'm a very picky eater."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty, hot & flavourful. Large selection of items on the menu.
Service was quick & efficient. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place took me by surprise.

It has a cafeteria feel but it's actually a dine-in kind of place.  

The winner was the japchae.  In our group, we had 2 people ordering the special of the day that came with a drink of your choice, soup, japchae and dumplings.  There was a bibimbap, and then the general tao.

Not sure if the general tao plate was good since I didn't try it, and I think the bibimbap was said to be ok - the meat served with it was cut up diced chicken strips.

The soup was cream of mushroom, and I ordered green tea as my drink.  Very good green tea - definitely matcha taste.  The japchae was served on a bed of rice and it was tasty.  Didn't expect them to get it right coming from a place that also served breakfast and coffee and sandwiches.  It was an eclectic menu.  But the pictures of some dishes helped persuade your choices.  The special came with pan fried dumplings that was served in a general tao sauce.   This was where it lost it for me.  It was very corn syrup-y.

The waitress explained that their ribs are the best sellers - perhaps go with that choice if you plan on stopping by.  I only know of this place because this is on my route to the airport and so I see it all the time. Seems to have a lot of loyal customers that come here.

They do put in effort for food presentation."}
{"text":"Cozy and friendly. Food is tasty. I enjoy eating here with my family. Near the airport. Outside might not look inviting but once you get inside the restaurant the place is relaxing and clean!!"}
{"text":"Soooo tasty, and the prices were good, too. The chef even came out to explain the dishes to us (and there was so much love and passion for what he does, obviously).

This restaurant is in a strip mall, but don't be fooled.... the food had great flavor and the service is great as well."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way to the airport. Restaurant is much nicer from the inside than from the outside. Everything was clean and well maintained. Very nice waitress. Took the lunch menu with chicken soup, bibimbob and a drink for $ 14.50. The soup honestly tasted like canned soup that had been tweaked a little bit. Bibimbob was good. Overall I think that this is a good value for money lunch place."}
{"text":"Really good food and very friendly staff. Both authentic and new recipes. Super Fast. Its located in a small mall so its easy to miss, but its completely worth the trip. Order the Kalbi and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Montreal and I was looking for a place to eat and I found this restaurant. 
Really clean and great service, food is pretty good. Sort of fusion style korean restaurant. 
Recommended to everyone especially korean first time visitors. :)"}
{"text":"Wow, who would have thought...

I've driven by this place more times than I can even remember, but never thought of actually eating there. Wanting to try something different in the West Island, I came to Yelp for answers. The reviews below are spot on. 

We ordered the Kalbi and the Jabchae, both of which were balanced and flavorful. The restaurant is clean and has a \"new\" feel to it. The waitress was friendly and gave us just the right amount of information about the menu. Given the speed of the service, the portion sizes, and the price range, Kimbob Cafe is a no-brainer for a quick lunch in the West Island!

I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Had our spicy Korean style food fix. 

The place is quiet and clean.

The server forgot to take one of our order but they sure caught up quick when we reminded them. 

We highly recommend their food!"}
{"text":"Literally everything we ordered was really good. Spicy pork, bulgogi and the fried ice cream is a must. We didn't expect this at Dorval especially coming from SoCal where Korean restaurants are everywhere. The server was really nice and sweet too."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the price is decent. The service is super quick and the waitress was very nice! The outside of the restaurant is kind of sketchy but the inside is very nice and clean."}
{"text":"After a recent stay at a hotel near Dorval Airport I had declared Dorval to be a restaurant wasteland. It's really sad when you think about it. As there are a decent amount of hotels near the airport however the restaurant selection is not as appealing, nor easily accessible or anything that seems to be build within the last 30 odd years. So a recent search of my bookmarks came up with Kimbob. See folks, Korean food is one of my faves. When done roger it's a meal based on some crazy good spice flavours and a healthy mix of noodles rice meat and veggies. 

Kimbob is an interesting place. Half of their menu is what I would call regular cafe food. Sandwiches, soups, salads. Stuff like cafeteria food. The other half is Korean food. An odd mix but it is near the Anglophone area of Dorval, Pointe Claire and also people who work at the airport. So the Korean is what I went for. I had ordered three dishes for two of us and it consisted of a Bibimbap (not very traditional) only in a big bowl with lettuce and diced chicken finger with rice and other veggies. The bimbap was a dissapointing 2/5. Dish number 2 was Japchae. This was just as expected. A healthy mix of mung bean noodles (glass noodles) beg with some meat in a slightly sweet yet sesame oil soya sauce flavour.. A very tasty dish and solid 4/5. Dish number 3 was Kalbi beef short rib. Very thinly sliced with grilled veggies and served over rice. It was delicious and perfect thin slice beef short rib for what Kalbi should taste like. This was a solid 4.5/5. It came with a small side of Kimchi which was nicely fermented and lightly spicy. 

The cafe is dark but comfortable. I think it's more of a lunch place. I mentioned it would be nice if they could serve up a seafood paejon or gymbuksul. The wife of the husband and wife team smiled nicely and said \"OK\". Not sure it will happen but two of the three dishes were a success! 

Overall I'd declare a 3.25/5 but worth coming back for two of the three dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick meal and very pleased with quality of service and food. I ordered the poutine with chicken katsu. 

Things I liked:
Overall a very satisfying meal following a long day of traveling. I liked that the chicken was very crispy and evenly fried throughout. The French fries were also very delicious, all evenly cooked and had great texture. 

Also the service was amazing! The server was very patient with me

Things I didn't like:
The gravy/sauce was a bit saltier than what I would've liked. I imagined a smoother texture and richer flavor.

Some of the cheese on my dish was a little cold. I think if the dish was brought out a little bit later for the cheese to melt, that would've been better.

Overall a positive experience and am looking forward to stopping by for some of their other meals on my return flight!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh but there was barely any beef and chicken in the bimimbop. We were both starving after half hour."}
{"text":"My first time eating here, and I tried the kimbibab with my fianc√©. It was very delicious and well made. The rice was cooked nicely and all the veggies were chopped finely so that eating would be easier. Every one was nice and checked on us if we needed help."}
{"text":"Our first night 8n town and we wanted to find a place where the locals go. We found this wonderful place. We love Korean and this is a gem of a place in Dorval Canada.  We had the Kalbi beef with sweet potato noodles and it came with carrot soup fist and fried green tea ice cream for dessert. If you are in town check it out the food and service are outstanding!"}
