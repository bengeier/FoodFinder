{"text":"Ok, so maybe it is not a complete five stars but it is definitely more than four. We went in to grab dinner before a concert (thanks to yelp reviewers). Situated between a series of hole in the wall restaurants, don't let first impressions fool you. We tucked ourselves into a back corner table and began the trip that is eat fresh!

First off, it is a three course prix fixe, so come hungry. Your menu , which also doubles as your place mat, introduces you to your  meal choices. There is a distinct absence of a drinks menu but hey,  it is easy to find lots of places in Toronto for a drink before or after dinner. Make it part of the adventure!

We had the shrimp bruschetta  and the arugula salad to start and they were great.  True to the name, the salad was fresh and light tasting even with late fall limited access to fruits and berries. The shrimp bruschetta was a definite highlight loaded with flavor and texture.  Presentation, if that's your thing, impresses as well, with all the courses artfully arranged...a definite contrast to the place mats! 

The first course  definitely ramps up your interesting dinner. I had the maple glazed pork chop and, wow, this is the come hungry portion of the program. The chop was huge and beautifully prepared, the mixed vegetables were a great and true mix, bok choy, carrots, beets, peppers, asparagus and mashed potatoes, all perfectly executed. This is a real raft of flavours and textures (a common theme) that work very well together. And did I mention  that the chop was huge! Our other main was a salmon and came with similarity well prepared veggies. Not being a salmon fan, I can't comment but my better half cleaned the whole plate away so...there you go.

Hard to believe we had room for dessert  but we did and the mango Ice cream and panna cotta did not disappoint. Again, beautifully presented and a great set of tastes to finish off the previous dishes.

The open kitchen, low key service and great food make this a repeat restaurant in a city where repeat visits mean a lot. We have an enormous number if choices for dining out in Toronto but I am already my list of people to take to Eat Fresh. Bravo!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for value, Eat Fresh Be Healthy is it. Huge portions will leave you stuffed for only $25 (for dinner). I have always recommended those looking for a decent dinner without the 5 star price to go to this restaurant. 

All that being said, in my most recent visit one thing bothered me immensely - the salt. The dishes I ordered, the calamari and the lamb, were way over salted. The one bottle of water was not enough to help wash it all down and I could still feel the effects the next morning. I read some other reviews mentioning this and I can confirm this criticism. The food is still cooked well nonetheless.

As others have mentioned, do not expect anything in terms of decor, and plan for your clothes to smell after dinner as you are literally eating next to the kitchen. I'll still come back again but may mention to watch out for the heavy handed seasoning."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and fantastic quality for money. Everything is fresh, and prepared with care and when ordered.  The portions are very large. 
Though the decor may make this place seem like a hole in the wall, the food tastes like it belongs in a much fancier restaurant, though if you were in a much fancier place, you would probably be paying twice as much for what is offered.

I've eaten here with family and friends and our meals are consistently good every time. The catering is also excellent and I would highly recommend for any size dinner party.

Living in this neighbourhood, all the other cuisine around here is mediocre at best, but I would highly recommend Eat Fresh Be Healthy."}
{"text":"Loved the food. It was clean, fresh, and simple. Just a note to families with young children, this place is not kid friendly even though the Yelp App says it is. They did not have high chairs nor kids menus. However it has great food. The quality of food and fair price make up for lack of ambiance and wait staff. Just leave the kids with a baby sitter."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the chain inspired decor or name, this place is fantastic. The family run resteraunt serves huge delicious sandwiches at very reasonable prices. I've never been for the prix fixe but I imagine it's just as delicious as the sandwiches.

The owners are friendly and passionate and the food is always fresh with imaginative twists. A personal favourite is the talapia and papaya sandwich. Be sure to not come too late for lunch as their sandwiches get sold very quickly.

Another thing to try is the Chef Dan dinner special. It's (an absurdly large) 3 course meal for 2 for a fraction of what it should cost. You need to order it in advance (without knowing what the special is) but their food is guaranteed to be worth it."}
{"text":"First time for me to write a review on yelp, but I feel that I have to.
There are so many restaurants on Dundas St, and it's easy for you to miss this one - very small, no shiny signs outside... But trust me, give it a try!
Only $25 for a 3-course dinner, you would be able to choose from 5 appetizers, 5 entrees and 2 desserts. My girl orders crispy chicken + pork chop + mango panna cotta, and for me it's calamari + beef liver + panna cotta. Literally everything is so well cooked, and with such a big portion! We are very hungry but yet to finish all of them. I love the panna cotta particularly, coz it's so creamy and melt in your mouth.
If I have to say something is not that good, we did wait a long time for the entrees, and the table is a bit shaky, But as it says, greatness awaits.
I strongly recommend this restaurant to you!"}
{"text":"Eat Fresh Be Healthy...a hidden gem for sure!

One of my coworkers live right at Bay & Dundas and he has dined at every single restaurant in and around this corner. Eat Fresh Be Healthy was THE restaurant he raved about. He told me to look past the restaurant's exterior and just give it a try.

I checked their winter menu a couple of weeks ago and I loved the options (a lot of seafood!). However, they changed their menu recently; my friend and I did not have the chance to dine here until last night. (Their website has not been updated, but you can check out their Facebook page for their current menu.) It was a rainy Wednesday night and they were not busy at all.

Appetizers:

* Crispy Shrimp Cake: I expected it to be more like a crab cake, but they breaded a whole shrimp. It was big and it was cooked perfectly. The breading was a little bitter though.
* Roasted Red Pepper and Cauliflower Bisque garnished with aged cheddar: Mmm...it was quite tasty, and the cheddar was a nice touch.

Entrées:

* Pan-Seared Seafood Platter: Smaller than expected, but for $25, we cannot ask for too much as it came with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes, too. The lobster tail, shrimp, and scallop were well cooked, but it was a little too salty for our liking.
* Cajun Blackened Salmon with fresh fruit salsa: It was a nice mix of mango, strawberry, watermelon, papaya, and even dragonfruit! The salmon was a good size and cooked well-done. We thought there was a lack of seasoning though -- it was definitely a healthy option.

Desserts:

* Milk Chocolate Panna Cotta: THE best part of my meal. Mmm... It was creamy and silky smooth. I wanted to ask for more!
* Pistachio Ice Cream: My friend is a big fan of pistachios and she said it was too milky, and not nutty enough. There were soft pistachios in the ice cream, too, but I am used to pistachios being crunchy.

We could tell that the chefs put a lot of effort into plating all of their dishes, as they added nice little touches here and there. Each dish is also made to order in their open kitchen. The portions are pretty good, too, especially for a 3-course meal for only $25. We are not a big fan of the other options on the current menu, but we decided that we will return every time they have a new menu. 

The restaurant is run by a friendly Indian couple, who are very kind and welcoming. The environment is fairly laid-back -- what I would call \"comfy fine dining\". The restaurant could use some decor (even just a few framed pictures), but seriously, don't let the exterior or the interior of the restaurant fool you. Walk in, have a sit, take a look and taste their food! You will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Freshest food ever, subtle and delicate tastes, reasonable price, welcoming service! They rotate their menu frequently so if you want anything particular like the grilled chicken they has just call then and pre-order it. My favorite dish was grilled salmon, chicken lollipop, double pistachio ice cream, lamb roll and shrimp cake with baby leaves salad. They cook all the sauces from daily fresh ingredients and everything from scratch, so you won't feel bloated after eating there and the food is easily digestible. PS, for Muslim friends, they have halal lamb and chicken. Chicken needs preorder thou, but lamb is always halal."}
{"text":"Another yummy lunch at Eat Fresh. Talented chef takes seasonal local fresh ingredients and combine them to make nutritious meals. Creative combinations and beautiful presentation and plating. Service is always kind. I always see other diners wowed and impressed by the food. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"To echo another review that I'd read somewhere else about EFBH, 5-star food for 3-star price.  The dishes were beautifully presented, generously portioned, and delicious."}
{"text":"We returned to Eat Fresh Be Healthy for an intimate dinner but loved what we had last time so much that we repeated our order (quail app, pork chop, panna cotta). 

This time we added (and really enjoyed) the mango lasse - it was a nice blend, not too tart or sweet. 

My only preference, for a future visit, would be to have a way to protect the potatoes from the au jus as they pretty much melted away."}
{"text":"Perfect for a special Birthday or any intimate party!

We had the great pleasure of hosting my 30th birthday here this summer. My boyfriend researched ALOT of restaurants while looking for the perfect place. We settled on Eat Fresh Be Healthy for many reasons - the location, price, freshness of ingredients, passion of Chef Dan, and best of all - we could have a private party for all of my friends. This made it particularly special for me.

Before we booked the place, we sat down and had a quick meeting with Chef Dan, and he answered any questions we had, advised us on how many people we could have and the menu. During the meeting he let us sample his cold watermelon passion fruit soup - it was amazing! I dreamed of bathing in this soup. And it sealed the deal, we booked the place after that.

So if you are thinking about having a special dinner or party this is what you need to know:

1. You can fit up to 35 people in the restaurant. Ideally you can have 24 guests sitting together on 2 large tables at the back of the restaurant. This is what we did. (if you have more, then there is the whole front of the restaurant as well)  We chose to use the front of the restaurant as a gathering spot- we set up a table for the cake, drinks and presents up there.

2. If you have more than about 20 + people, they will closed down the whole restaurant for your event.

3. Though they don't have a liquor license, you can easily get one for $25, and then bring your own booze. It's more economical this way anyway!

4. The food. It's delicious! He focuses on fresh, in-season ingredients and they shine! 5. You can get a 3 course meal for $25+ tax. And the portions are great- you will get stuffed!

6. Chef Dan is very accommodating and will help you customize a menu for your group. His menu is ever changing as he keeps it in season.

7. Some of the reviews mention that this isn't a 'glamourous' restaurant (which is why I checked it out in person first) but don't let that worry you. They have deep red walls that are a great backdrop to the black cloth table clothes they use for the parties, and once everyone is there, it becomes a lovely spot for your celebration!
They will also let you come in and set it up anyway you like. We brought our own birthday decorations and decorated it before the guests arrived.

8. There is an open kitchen which is fun for your guests as you get to watch them cooking and plating everything!

9. Because of the small space, it can take sometime to plate everything. Chef dan made us aware of this beforehand. They were basically serving an entire restaurant at once, so this is understandable I think. They serve things table by table (we had 2 tables of 12), and I don't think it was a problem at all. We let our guests know it was perfectly acceptable to dig in as soon as they were served, and it just gave us all more time to chat, laugh and 'oh and aw' at everyone's food as it came out!


All night I heard - yummm, ohhh, this is sooo good, etc! Everyone was congratulating us on picking such a wonderful place! We even have 2 friends order an extra shrimp appetizer, because they just wanted to try how good it was!

We are coming back to bring my dad next week! And will definitely come back more. They do catering as well, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them, as their food is exceptional.


Here's the menu we selected for the party: All dishes were hits!

{"text":"This is a great restaurant, great fool with a good price. Every thing I had was cooked to perfection. How ever there was a little health concerns for me. My boy friend had ordered the maple mustard pork, found a bug in his side veggies. Also I found mould on my raspberry use as garnish for ice cream. Despite all that I still very much enjoyed the food and would recommend this place. Just keep an eye on the side fruits and veggies."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, all the positive reviews are true. This place is amazing.

It is a small place, with just a few tables at the front and the back. There is an open kitchen right in the middle, where you can see Chef Dan and his sous-chef in action. 

The waitress was a very nice lady who was very appreciative, and attentive.

The quality of the food is amazing, and the colors on the plates are vibrant. Everything was cooked very well. Fish was moist, meat was tender, pasta was al dente, and what needed to be crispy was crispy. Nothing is heavily seasoned, and everything tastes a bit lighter and less oily than other restaurants. Eat fresh, be healthy indeed.

Personally, the food I had at EFBH is better than what I had at some of the fancier places where I paid $50+.

Now, this place does not have any fancy decor, and it can feel more like a neighborhood café-ish diner, because of the less-than-exciting decor and furniture... However, it is a charming little place in a great location where Chef Dan and his sous-chef cook healthy, fresh, exciting, pretty and very tasty dishes. 

I want to support local establishments like this, where people cook their food with love, taking their patrons` health into consideration, and offer it at such a great value. I would love to see this place blossom even more.

Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place got such good reviews. I will admit that I only went there once (New years eve), but that one convinced me to never go there again, and would not recommend this to anybody.

Nothing out of my experience was \"good\".

The restaurant itself does not look very nice. I see they made maybe SOME effort (painted walls, table cloths, small decorations), but the overall setting is poor. Lighting is poor, the walls have no decorations (paintings/photos),  the table and chairs that me and my girlfriend sat on were wobbly, it was a bit cold, and the washroom is very ghetto. I won't say it was dirty, but there was only 1 washroom, which was right next to a place where they put the dirty dishes. My overall experience of being at the restaurant was 1/5.

The food was at best \"alright\". I went with the $25 set dinner). Price wise, it is alright (I wouldn't say a good deal, but not a bad one either). Food presentation look pretty good, and the taste of it was alright. However, my main dish, seafood/calamari pasta, was a bit salty. The mango panna cotta was good though. I would say 3.5/5 for overall food experience.

I would say service was not good. Yes, the chef did greeted us when we came in, and the 1 lady/waiter was moderately nice. But we had asked for warm water and she says they do not have it?!?! How can they not have something so basic?! On top of that, they did not apologize. I'm not asking for a deep and long apology, but they didn't even say anything like \"Sorry, but we don't have it at the moment.\" They literally did NOT say the word \"sorry\" or \"apology\". Yes, they were nice, but isn't that expected from all restaurants? From my point of view, she didn't really care about us at all, I would give service a 0/5.

Again this could have been a bad day for them, but this was my experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unbelievably good! The food is amazing! The menu changes with what's in season. From the appetizer to the dessert every bite was incredible! The customer service was also wonderful. I could eat here everyday :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been added to my secret place list definitely. The food is much better than most stupidly expensive restaurants out there even though the ambiance might not be terrific."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Although this restaurant is classified as Italian, it is more like a mediterrean fusion. 

The menu is amazing considering the portion and the taste of the food when you consider high end restaurant prices.

I had today part of the winterlicious menu, there are various options to choose from. This has been my third time here and it seems that people have caught on to this restaurant.  

It seems during this time for winterlicious you pretty much have to book ahead to get a spot. I have seen perhaps 20 plus people not being able to sit as reservation was tight given the space they had.

I would recommend this restaurant to all. From outside it looks just like a small cafe as one person said, space is limited. But don't be fooled, there are ample seating at the back and the food comes relatively fast. Highly recommend this to all!"}
{"text":"I see a lot of comments down there saying the restaurant doesn't have great renovation. Keep in mind that this place is a family restaurant. I go there for the food. If I want a high class atmosphere, I would have chosen another restaurant. I love their food there, and I have been there for three times already. I strongly suggest the quail for appetizer and it is my favourite. Overall, great experience, great service, and good price for 3 course meal. I love it much more than those 'summerlicious' 'winterlicious' at high class restaurants..

They do change their menu sometimes depending on the season and availability. However, main problem is that they do not change their menus often enough. I went there for three times and I don't think I will go there again anytime soon because it is still the same thing on the menu and there are limited options."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, inventive food.  You can taste the freshness and the attention to detail.  Completely agree with other reviews that they are focused on food quality rather than decor.  I have no issues with that as the food was phenomenal !!"}
{"text":"So I was looking for a place downtown to host a surprise birthday party for my fiance that a) could accommodate 20 people, b) had excellent food quality & a varied menu, and c) was affordable for everyone. I stumbled upon this restaurant and took a chance based on all the awesome reviews it was getting. I'm a big foodie so I usually like to actually know and trust the place before taking other people. 

The good reviews do not lie people! This place was a huuuuge hit with everyone at the party. 

SERVICE:
First of all - everyone there was super nice and friendly and the service was awesome. Having worked as a server for over a decade, I know and appreciate good service. It was perfect. Our water was always filled, we had everything we needed, and our server was attentive, friendly, and helpful with the menu. 

They close at 9pm but we didn't finish eating until past 9 and then spent some time mingling and opening gifts. We didn't leave until about 1030pm. Of course I felt bad because I know what it's like, but I spoke with them and they were so generous and kind, telling us we could take our time and not to worry. Very gracious and thoughtful people. 

FOOD:
I'm a Nutritionist and this place is nutritionist approved! 

AMAAAAZING!!! The prix fixe menu is delicious! The ingredients were all very fresh and were super tasty. The presentation was gorgeous and everything was so flavorful.
I tried a bit of everyone's dishes to see how I felt about all of the apps and entrees and they all passed with flying colors.  

I personally had the shrimp bruschetta which was so mouth watering good, the chicken which had incredible flavor and was the perfect texture, and the panna cotta for dessert which was so good. 

Don't let the $25 price fool you - trust me. Try it and you will know exactly what I mean.

THOUGHTS:
Everyone at the party couldn't stop telling me what a great spot I had chosen. They have an awesome team, are allergy and gluten-free friendly, and offer vegetarian dishes as well. The menu has enough options to please everyone. 

BOOK YOUR EVENTS HERE IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS, EAT AWESOME FOOD, AND FEEL RIGHT AT HOME!!!"}
{"text":"Little hidden gem in the heart of downtown! This place offers 3 course lunch and dinner menu, priced at $20 and $25. The menu changes frequently, so check their facebook page for the most up to date menu. I came here for dinner with couple of my friends for dinner. The portions were very generous especially the main course. I had fried calamari rings with cream as appetizer, spicy calamari and shrimp pasta as main and for dessert I had pistachio ice cream with wafer. The presentation of the plating with phenomenal, it looked like something you would have in a much fancier restaurant. One of my friends had the pork chops which was a bit dry, but other than that all 3 meals were delicious. 

The one thing that I took a star off is the decor, it is a bit older and there is only one washroom for both men and women, so often times there is a bit of a lineup. Another thing to bear in mind is that they don't accept credit card, but they do allow separate bills and can pay by cash and debit.  

I would definitely come back again to try out their lunch menu and can't wait to see what they have in store next for their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It feels like being in someone's home. The place isnt fancy at all. But the food was just meh. I had the spicy chicken thighs which were alright but not very spicy. The best part of the dish was the peach salad underneath the chicken. I had the lamb which again was just alright. The vegetables were terrible. They were undercooked and basically inedible. The lamb was very gamey. The dessert was much better. I rather liked the mango panna cotta, it tasted like a rich mango pudding. The sauce I could have done without..."}
{"text":"We went here to enjoy the prix fixe on a Friday night and were able to get reservations the day of. Great meal and service. Busy inside yet food was timely and tasted great. Very original menu; some more adventurous choices perhaps."}
{"text":"This place is stellar and I go here all the time.  Dingy decore, but super nice service, and absolutely amazing food.   When you go, just remember, you're not at Canoe so you're not going to get their service, but you'll be getting their level of food."}
{"text":"Awesome culinary experience!  Great value, presentation, and quality.  I tried to come in late the night before but they had sold out of food as they prepare everything fresh each day.  I came back the next night (early) and had a great experience.  It started pouring rain at the end of my dinner and they gave me an umbrella to walk back to my hotel.  I can't help but feel I got more than my moneys worth.  $25 for a 3 course gourmet meal and a free umbrella!"}
{"text":"Amazing price for great food. Worth the try. Call ahead of time to make reservations at least 30mins before the time you want to come. I definitely would come back. 

Atomosphere - I dont know if some pot lights bulbs were just not working or it was done on purpose but I didnt enjoy the lighting. lt was dark but not in a romantic or night vibe kind of way. Just felt off and uncomfortable. I sat near the front where there was a heater 1 table down but it didnt reach me and I felt cold. 2/5

Service - 5/5 nothing much to say, service was great. 

Food - 4/5 most dishes were rly good, some lacked but all worth it in terms of value and quality. *thumbs up*

As I stated before I would come back and hope to try another set course by the creative chefs."}
{"text":"Food is more impressing than the venue. The people that work there are nice enough, but you have to overcome the challenge of the appearance of the restaurant. Also when it gets busy they can be a little bit slow, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I am grateful to yelp reviewers for pointing me in the direction of this little gem. The location (central, though not teeming with amazing dining experiences nearby) and name would not have intrigued me if I hadn't seen all the 5 stars here. 

The set menu- $25 for 3 courses- is a such great deal. Though choice may be limited all the options sounded so tasty that there were no problems for our group of 4. We hadn't checked ahead of time if they were licensed, no dice. I managed to convince the boozehounds I am pals with to leave the flipping tables til later and give it a shot. Though once they'd seen some of the meals coming out to other diners they were actually excited to start ordering. It's brightly lit, no fuss atmosphere, not for romance but great for a mid-week dinner as we did. 

The presentation of the food is really quite incredible. The appetizers were by far the best part of the meal- the quail and the lamb rolls were inventive and delicious. The portions for the mains were frankly out of control, it was the biggest pork chop I have ever been confronted with. All our mains were good, but in almost intimidating portions!

Service was very attentive and helpful.

Would definitely recommend- great food for an exceptionally reasonable price for downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"This is truly a get in Toronto's downtown core. I like smaller restaurants because they are quieter and more relaxed. The wait staff here was very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The food was very hot, fresh, delicious, and thoughtfully presented. And the overall value was excellent. I eat a lot and was very full with their very excellent $25 3 course dinner menu. I will definitely be coming back by cause this venue is conveniently located, delicious, and a very unique dining experience. I find it to be a very economic and classy halfway point between fancy gourmet and a simple large massive meal!"}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just so I could write a review about this place. Great value at $25 for a three course fixed-price dinner ($15 for a three course fixed-price lunch). The food is out of this world.

Highly recommended! I'll be going back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Disappointing, especially because it's rated so highly. Not worth going back again.
_______________________________________________________________

Food was half good, half bad. They try to make it look fancy... but... presentation can only do so much.

Service was fine, the staff was polite.

Space is cramped - our table felt like it was in the hallway. 

Cleanliness***** A medium sized cockroach crawled up on the wall by our heads and hung out for a while. After pointing it out to one of the staff, she chased it with a napkin from the wall, to the table, to the floor under our table... it was gross. They apologized, but did not offer anything to make up for the scene. Next time, I would  ask for the meal to be waived or discounted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the dishes I picked from the 15$ prix fix lunch for summerlicious 2014 :


Tamil Eelam Spicy Lamb Rolls serves with Pomegranate Yogurt
Butter Chicken serves with Saffron Basmati Rice 
Alfonso Mango Panna Cotta


FOOD
- The lamb rolls were good. Nice combination of meat, spice and potato. 

- The \"butter chicken\" was over-cooked (very dry), Chinese style crispy skin chicken!  No Indian spices or flavours whatsoever; I don't understand how they could call it butter chicken. There was a mango sauce drizzled on top, but... moreso for looks. The rice was fine, the fresh tomato was good... but not good enough to compensate for overcooked pieces of Chinese style fried chicken :(

- The mango dessert was good - cool, creamy, sweet, and gentle."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant.  Freshest of Food. Delicious soup.  The best humus you will ever taste and the best hosts.  The food is fantastic. You will not regret stopping in for lunch, dinner or brunch.  It really is the best food in the City.  Every plate comes out as if you are in a gourmet restaurant and tastes even better...  i love Chef Dan and his wife too...they are so sweet!! EAT HERE, you will love it."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I am giving it a 4 star for the value and tastiness - a lunch time sit down 3 course meal for $15 and the food is indeed fresh and quite good.  Not sure how \"healthy\" it is as the mashed potatoes it came with were really buttery...and the pork chop was quite fatty and salty. But it sure did taste good!
I give it a 3 star for service.  Although the service is friendly and the staff are extremely nice, the service was sloooooooooow.  We were probably here for over 1.5 hours. There was 1 chef, 1 server and a second man helping out wherever he could. 
If you are in a rush or only have a 1 hour lunch, I wouldn't recommend coming here.  If you have some time, and want a good meal for a great price, then definitely pop by!"}
{"text":"Worst experience at this restaurant! I was very disappointed and was treated terribly. I came in with my mother and aunt. We choose to do the fix prix menu which comes with an appetizer, main and desert. Appetizer was good. The main was good, I got pasta with Salmon. I asked if there was grated cheese for the pasta and  the waiter said no. I didn't understand because I could see the cheese on the counter where the chefs were cooking and my mom had it on her salad! She just didn't want to give me the cheese. Then desert happened. I asked for the ice cream and cone -this never said it had any fruits in it- and when it came it had fruits and two large pieces of cones put on the scoop of ice cream and looked very nice but IM ALLERGIC TO STRAWBERRIES. Instead of being nice about it when I told the waiter I was allergic and I could not eat it, she got upset with me and said \"WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME YOU WERE ALLERGIC\" which in her defence is true I should have but i did not see fruits would be in the meal! Terrible costumer service! I asked if I could get another one with out strawberries and it was a big fuss! She comes back with a single scope of ice cream! No cone, no fruits, nothing! By then I told my self I would never waste my money and come here ever ever ever again! Terrible business and I'm
So happy I can vent this out because I left there feeling so upset, I was very excited to eat there! Oh well."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the decor.  The food here is excellent.
The catering is excellent.
The sandwiches at lunch are excellent.
Everything is also excellent value for money.  The portions are massive.  Two people could probably share a sandwich and the accompanying salad."}
{"text":"I went here for a small lunch function this summer.  They had a set menu for us.  I had a watermelon soup which was very refreshing considering the hot day and how hot this place gets.  I also had a fresh roll which was tasty.  The main course was a bone-in grilled pork chop.  This thing was a big cut.  I was surprised by this lunch portion and I'm a big eater.  The plate came beautifully (artistically) decorated with fresh vegetables.  A lot of people in our group took pictures of their meal.  The price was very reasonable for what we got.

The restaurant itself is really small, with the open kitchen alongside the tables.  This makes the place very warm/hot in the summer.  It's probably very comfortable in the winter.

The wait staff was very friendly.  I suggest trying this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food for the price you are paying. Chef Dan and his wife are both very nice and give amazing service. Their sandwiches are really good and at a great price too."}
{"text":"I went here and loved it. One of the best dining experiences I've had in awhile. Despite the pre-selected menu, you do have many options. Don't come here for the ambience. Its a tiny place with minimal decorations. The presentation of the food was beautiful. I prefer pretty food that smells heavenly to flowers on the table. The food was tasty and seasoned well, portions were big, service was warm. Food truly was healthy. Fresh produce was used and you see them cook your meal as the kitchen is next to the dining area. I like to watch my food being made. The chef was exceptional. Don't come here if you don't like veggies or fruit though. I left full and happy. Such a great experience that I wanted to tip well but couldn't leave as much money as I wanted because I ran out of Canadian money. Bottom line I have payed more for not as good a meal."}
{"text":"I have passed this place a couple of times and have always assumed that it was a salad place because of the name and how the store front looks! Boy was I wrong! 

I came here with family last week and we all had the $25 prix fix menu which was a steal for an appetizer, main course and dessert. The decor is lacking in this place, but the presentation and quality of food is very good. You can tell from the presentation of the dishes that the chef had training in higher end restaurants. The menu changes seasonally and the chef tries to source his ingredients locally, a concept that I highly admire and support. On the food:

For appetizer I tried the following:

Spicy lollipop chicken -  I got 2 drumsticks which were well seasoned but not spicy, it was lightly fried and served with a mango chutney. Overall, I was pleased with the quantity and presentation of food in this course. I was disappointed that it was not spicy whatsoever.

Shrimp cake - This came with a nice arugula and tomato salad and was nicely plated as well. The shrimp cake itself consisted of 1 large shrimp coated in seasoned potatoes which was breaded and fried. The cake has a nice crisp texture, and it was a filling amount of food. However it only had 1 shrimp, hence the shrimp to potato ratio was very low, making it more a potato cake than shrimp cake...

For the main I had the Seafood Platter - This dish came with AMPLE vegetables which I really enjoyed. All the vegetables were well cooked (as in NOT overcooked). It also came with mash potatoes, and grilled shrimps, scallops and a small (very small) lobster tail. For the price I was satisfied and it was nicely presented. All the seafood was well seasoned.

Some family members had the gnocchi which they said were good, the portion was quite large for that dish.

For dessert I had the pistachio  ice cream, the presentation was very high end looking. The ice cream was not too sweet and was a nice ending to the meal. My husband had the milk chocolate panna cotta and said that it was smooth and creamy.

Service in general was ok, there was only 1 server who I think is the owner's wife? The decor definitely did not match the caliber of food served. Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal! For $25 it was a steal. I think that this place is still a somewhat hidden gem because of the decor and the somewhat misleading name of this place. I would definitely return to sample more of Chef Dan's cooking!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here -- presentation was some of the best I have seen in Toronto and chef Dan personally came out to say hello and ask if we enjoyed the food. Highly recommend this restaurant for value and quality."}
{"text":"From the outside, this may appear to be just another cheap-and-cheerful joint like the many other options on the block. But upon stepping inside, Chef Dan's commitment to his food and warm smile let's you know that this is something different.

Service - friendly, warm and personable. It's unhurried (which is something I'm not used to), but I realized I just needed to take a breath, and relax. 

Food - more on par with the fare on Elm Street than Eat Fresh Be Healthy's fast food neighbours! Like the service, great care is taken and Chef Dan prepares everything from scratch. In chatting with the Chef, even the pasta is made in-house, and the daily specials reflect what is in-season. Food presentation is a standout.

The takeout prices are beyond reasonable, though be prepared as eat-in dinner prices are higher. I took my family here for brunch on a weekend and not only do they take reservations, but the food was outstanding, and a great alternative to the hectic rushes elsewhere."}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner there tonight it was an amazing experience. The food were well cooked and really delicious. Service was nice as well. Highly recommended!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem.  Very good food and very reasonable pricing.  The quality and freshness of the local ingredients actually does make a difference.  Don't let the look of the place turn you off - definitely worth a shot.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Don't  let the plain decor fool you.  The food is pretty spectacular. It's not exactly traditional Italian....more Italian fusian.

Octopus and lamb rolls appertizer have an Indian spin  to it. unusual yet tasty. The Halibut special was very moist.

Nicest couple. I wish them well."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after finding the place listed in the Winterlicious website, and of course, checking the reviews on Yelp.. 

For starters, my companion and I tried the calamari  and squash/coconut bisque.  Both were well made and served to whet our appetite for the next course. Dessert was delicious - panna cotta for me and sorbet for my bf. 

For my entree, I ordered the pork chop with mash and vegetables, and here I was a little disappointed.  My first few bites of the pork chop were excellent, and I was almost ready to declare that it was the best pork chop I ever had.  The bites were well seasoned, moist and tender.  But as I worked towards the middle and towards the bone, I was dismayed to discover two things: First, the rest of the meat was under cooked (in fact, looked raw in a certain part), and second, the seasoning was somehow lacking in the other half of the chop.  When I mentioned to the waitress that the meat was not fully cooked, all she said was that was how it was supposed to be.  Don't know if this is true or not, but that didn't make me feel any better about eating the rest. Good restaurants would ask their customers how they want their steaks, so it shouldn't be any different in this situation. At the very least, warn the customer at the time of ordering that the pork might not be cooked all the way through if that is really how it's supposed to be cooked. The vegetables were a little odd too. As I worked my way through the veggies, I discovered it was just a mix of raw and lightly cooked veggies (plus one pickle) thrown together to form a pyramid. Underneath was a sad clump of sour mashed potatoes, which only seemed to serve as an anchor for the elaborate veggie sculpture. I found myself wishing for more potatoes and perhaps a more cohesive (and cooked) veggie dish - even a stir-fry will do. So, what started out as a very promising dish turned out  to be a bit of a let down. I did try  my bf's salmon and pasta, which was quite good.

I would not rule out the possibility of coming back. After all, 5 good dishes out of 6 isn't so bad. I might stay away from the pork chop next time though."}
{"text":"I'd recommend the double cut pork chop. I've been twice and both times were excellent. 

it's nothing fancy, but for the price, you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Good lord! Eat Fresh Be Healthy where have you been all my life? I am waiting for this place to blow up. Amazing food! Great service! Very Creative! Run by a husband and wife - just the kind of place I like to support. This is a hundred percent must try and a place you will want to tell all your friends and family and believe me they deserve it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the reasons I love Toronto. 

Fresh ingredients, great flavours, super value and cooked with a lot of heart. Service was so friendly. Love them. 

This place is easy to disregard as the storefront...basic. Eat here once and you'll wonder why you didn't come sooner. 

All of our dishes were excellent. But the slow  cooked blue crab was outstanding. Small touches like thoughtful plating and homemade hot sauce counts for a lot. Lots of fresh vegetables and fruit to accompany your dishes. Eat Fresh Be Healthy!"}
{"text":"The BEST restaurant in the city! 
Extremely fresh and creative! 
Cant wait to go again! oh, and super nice people own it as well!
Great price and you wont stop thinking about how yummy the food was even days later!"}
{"text":"Don't judge this restaurant by its exterior. The quality of food far surpasses its neighboring restaurants for something only slightly more expensive (~20-25$). They only serve a seasonal prix fixe I believe and there is a tonne of variety in each dish with an insane amount of fresh vegetables (convincingly healthy however the taste is bland-ish for veggies as you might expect). The rest of the dish makes up for it and service is good too so it's hard to complain"}
{"text":"Strangely named for a restaurant that lives in a bare, rectangular box, that serves food that looks like it came out of a cuisine magazine and tastes amazing - everything about this place is so confusing!

I'm in town for work and braved -28 F weather to walk down the street and try one of the most oddly named and not-so-extravagant looking top rated restaurants I've ever been to.  I wanted something yummy that would fit within my stipend and fill me up.  Thank you Yelp, for Yelping me out :)

Eat Fresh Be Healthy - I asked the owner what the origin of the name was, and all she said was \"He (the chef) just made something up\".  LOL.  Ok, that makes sense then.

4.5 stars, rounded up.

Exterior - unassuming, hole-in-the-wall looking almost.  Don't let that fool you!
Interior - open kitchen and extremely smelly.  I left the place smelling like grease and oil - yuck.  They had the fan off today because it's so frigid outside - something about cold air coming inside - which makes sense.  Also, half the lights were off and it was almost like eating in an abandoned store.  Mostly, the -.5 points comes off here.

The chef and his wife are both Sri Lankan.  I asked the wife how they would categorize their dishes - Italian fusion... interesting.  I noticed that the wife went around each table and asked each party where they found out about the restaurant and all said the same - online.  Then I noticed she mentioned to everyone that if they enjoyed their experience, to please write about it online.  Good marketing tactic I suppose, but I'm writing my review not because I was asked, but because I feel like this place deserves some love.  

Dishes are cooked to order and may take a little longer than you would expect, but it comes out hot and fresh.  The presentation is amazing - they really take their time to make your dishes look tasty.

Food:

$25, prix fixe - 3 courses.

Pan-seared quail - this is some of the best poultry/bird I have ever had.  I don't usually like poultry!  Wonderfully seasoned and flavorful quail on top of a bed of argula, pomegranate, and blackberries.  My favorite out of the 3 dishes.  Perfectly cooked.

Ontario braised lamb ribs - 6 ribs, fall of the rack juicy and quite fatty as well.  Also seasoned very well with a special type of BBQ sauce on top.  Mashed potatoes were funky - seemed like they weren't actual potatoes, but rather the powdered stuff - not a fan.  I had vegetables on my plate that I had never seen before and asked about them - a purple heirloom carrot and a golden beet!  Love how creative and unconventional the veggies are.  Also came with bok choy, a giant broccoli crown, white asparagus, string beans, and the most perfectly grilled red pepper.  This was actually a lot of food and it's one of those feelings where you eat it and it's really good and afterwards you want to throw up a little because it was so much.

Butternut squash + coconut panna cotta - the texture of the panna cotta wasn't quite right - it was a little too runny and soft.  Still, it was delicious.  Smooth, creamy, and milky.  The whole thing tastes a little like egg nog.

Service was great - my napkins were replaced and I was always asked how I was doing.  Wifey is a great conversationalist as well."}
{"text":"I've been to eat fresh be healthy 5 times and I would give it a total of 25 stars!!!!! 
The food is amazing!!!!!! Great presentation, healthy options (they give you lots of vegetables in the entrée) and the portions are BIG!!! It is a three course prix fixe menu and the menu changes every ~6 months but some classics stay on the menu. I strongly recommend the spicy drumsticks (no joke, they are spicy), braised lamb, blue crab, pork chop, portobello mushroom, and salmon. For dessert the mango panna cotta is a must try! 
For $25 it is quite a steal. It is in downtown core and for the quality of food and the friendly service you can rarely find another restaurant as good as this one. The only thing on the not so positive side is that the restaurant  doesn't have the best interior. They also only give you bottled waters (unlimited though)! It's open kitchen so you can see how your food is being prepared but the smell might linger on your clothes and hair.
If you're looking for a super fancy place to impress a first date, this might not be the place for you. But if your date and you are just looking for amazing food and great service, you HAVE to come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! Everything was so flavorful and tastefully prepared.  The service was great and I enjoyed that the kitchen was out in the open where you could see your food being prepared.  Also a great price for the quality and variety of food served. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A 3-course meal for $25 containing so many fresh vegetables?  Yes, please!  I'm often disappointed by how few vegetables you get with your main dish, but Eat Fresh, Be Healthy had me covered.  The butternut squash soup I had as an appetizer was really tasty, and my main course of lamb rack with an assortment of vegetables was very nice.  I particularly enjoyed the pickled beet and the well-seasoned mashed potatoes.  The espresso panna cotte I had as a dessert was fine, if nothing exceptional.  Overall, the service was friendly, and the food was absolutely delicious.  I'll certainly be happy to go back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The kitchen is in the dinning room therefore you can see your order come up as well as know things are made to order.

The pairing of flavors are fantastic as well as the menu options. If you're visiting Toronto this is a definite stop! Be aware that this is cash or debit only, no credit.

The pork chop and the mango panna cotta are fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Favorite meal in Toronto!! My boyfriend and I came for our anniversary dinner while visiting from the US. The staff was very nice and attentive, and although they warn you that the dishes are made to order and can take some time to prepare, everything came out quickly, with just the right timing between courses. I ordered the shrimp cake, lamb ribs, and chocolate panna cotta. Everything was so flavorful and the dishes were very well thought out. Beautiful presentation on every dish. I only needed a knife for my vegetables, the lamb was so tender, it fell right off the bone! I highly recommend this place, and I just wish I had found it sooner! Extra bonus, it was right around the corner from our hotel! Fantastic experience!!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food tasted pretty good and came in a huge portion, but the overall feel of the restaurant is a bit dinghy. The sign out front is very drab and to be honest, I was a little put off by the decor (or lack of) when I stepped inside, but I'm glad I gave the food a chance. The type of food being served here belongs in a decked out bistro, not in a hole-in-the-wall surrounded by fast food joints.

The prices, if you get the food to go, are very good for the quality and quantity of food you're getting, but for some reason the same dishes cost about 50% more if you stay there to eat it, which I thought was a really weird pricing scheme.  I had the braised lamb rib entree for $8.50 (to go) which included fresh vegetables and mashed potatoes. The lamb was very flavourful but maybe slightly too peppery.  Because the food is made to order, I had to wait for about 10-15 minutes, but the server told me I could call in my order next time.

If you can look past the decor or want non-fast-food take out, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch with a friend and was looking forward to try their food. The place is small but the service and food was very good.
I had the Shrimp Bruchetta, Quail, Salmon served with fresh fruit salsa and Panna Cotta and loved them all.
My friend had the shrimp bisque, the Spaghetti with Bolognese Sauce and Panna Cotta and she loved her food as well. 
I was very impressed with the fruit and vegetables served, which made the meal healthier. I would definitely try this restaurant again and recommend it to my friends :) I hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious lunch and it wasn't the best. I had calamari which was just average, nothing spectacular. The main was the pork chop which was dry, and the worst part of the meal. The vegetables had a very weird vinegar sauce that contaminated the mash potatoes, ruining the entire main course for me. The best part was the dessert which was the panacotta. But its not worth it to pay $18 just for dessert. Wouldn't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Based on reviews, I tried it out.  Reviews are correct that the view is deceptive.  Walked past it twice thinking I might have it wrong but then noticed all the accolades on the window and despite the place being empty I went in.  I soon was thankful I did.  Chef Dan and his partner are wonderful hosts.  The meal was a fixed selection around 3 courses but they offered me a second appetizer when sharing that my choice of dessert was not available.  The appetizers of roasted tomato soup and then the calamari were the highlights in term of taste and presentation.  Had the salmon which made for a meal fitting of their name.  Highly recommend and the bill did not reflect the quality of the food.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Give it a 4 star considering the healthiness and surprise of the place!  Was a great meal that wasn't overseasoned/salted and def high quality food.  Salmon was just OK but everything else was good and i don't feel like crap after.  Affordable set price and definitely  a must-go place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place at the beginning of May (as I could remember). I was attracted by the high ratings (actually it topped in ratings in my search for Italian food!) and the amazingly low price for a 3-course meal. And yes, considering the pricing the meal was good enough. Particularly their serving sizes were really large.

However, a somewhat disappointing comment I would have for this restaurant is still \"you get what you pay for\". It is a good attempt to provide fancy looking food with more acceptable prices, but if it is that easy, then why are there still so many places providing 3-course meals for 50 dollars or even higher? So here is the point: you don't have to be an epicure to see the food is not totally delicate, or anything that blast your sense; you wouldn't expect tranquil or trendy ambiance there either, since the kitchen is open and you will hear the noise and smell the oily smoke all the times, and the wall is painted in red, which appeared to be a bit annoying to me.

Besides, I would doubt if the food they provided could really be categorized as \"Italian\", they tasted more like some fusions, or maybe Indian (then probably the person adding category clicked the wrong one because of the similar spelling)?

Personally I would say beating the high-end restaurant is never that easy, and I found the categorization and some of the comments for this place are misleading. This place probably works for those who just want to go through the 3-course meal without expecting too much about quality, or authenticity."}
{"text":"This place offers basic surroundings but a clear commitment to quality and creativity at a reasonable price point. The food is not outstanding, but is not priced to be perceived as such. For what you pay, you get tremendous value and a sense that the people running this business are salt of the earth. Makes you feel good on two important levels."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the looks of this place. It's a small box, and the small staff consists of a friendly lady and two cooks. The food is phenomenal. I had the pork chop and my friend had the salmon. Both were cooked perfectly and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Odd little cafe on the border of Chinatown and Downtown Toronto, but every dish is lovingly cooked to order and tasted FRESH! 

2 ways to order - a la carte or 3 course prix fixe ($15 for lunch, $25 for dinner). 

GET THE PRIX FRIE... so much bang for the buck!!

appetizers .. 
we tried their organic kale salad with mango, dragon fruit, grapes, melons, hints of mint dressed with maple vinaigrette. SO refreshing and tasty!! 

also had their quail which was extremely tender, juicy and so much flavor!! 

entrees.. 
DOUBLE CUT PORK CHOP!! It was huge!! Came with a side of veggies and mash potatoes. Great flavor, very tender. LOVED the crushed cashews on top... a good crunch to the sear. 


Swordfish ... while very fresh and tasty. It tasted like a continuation of our salad because they use the same fruits as the salad. Suggest they recommend pairings so everything doesn't taste the same throughout. Also had a side of mash and veggies, which was too much for fish imo. It should've gone with a side bed of rice or quinoa, wheatberry... to be more diverse, and innovative. 

desserts.. 
we loved the simple strawberry sorbet . the panna cotta was good but it had strange tasting sauce at the bottom that didn't mix well..


ALL IN ALL... a STEAL for the quality and amount. Service is also beyond friendly!! Worth a stop! :)"}
{"text":"Ten of us were coming from Montreal (I'm from the US but was visiting Montreal at that time) for the New Year's when we realized that we hadn't made any reservation for our New Year's Eve dinner. It was quite late the night before and we were certain that most restaurants would have been either full, or closed. After Yelping a few options for a nice affordable dining experience near downtown Toronto, we decided to give Eat Fresh Be Healthy a call. Luckily, they picked up even though it was past their operating hours. 

We made a reservation for twelve and it took almost an hour for our party to gather (we were coming in separately). Other restaurants would probably have kicked us out by then but the nice owner lady said that they were willing to stay open until 10:30 pm for us.

Walking in, the place looked nothing like a fancy dining place, it was very unassuming and that sent an alarm ringing in our heads. After having a look around at what the other tables were served, however, we were immediately reassured. Everything looked fantastic! The owner lady made a couple of suggestions of what we should get for the night, and everything came out perfect! My favorite was the pan seared quail and the creamy mango ice cream. 

Don't let the cheesy name and hole-in-the-wall appearance fool you! I would totally come again but sadly I don't even live in Canada :("}
{"text":"Finally! A place to eat a hearty wholesome meal in Toronto without breaking the bank! Chef Dan and his family are wonderful friendly people who serve great food and great portions all in a delicious package. Unlike so many other offerings in town this place is substance over style - look past the meh decor and focus on the food and service. I had the delicious veal scallopini with sides to go and Chef Dan threw in a mouthwatering beef short rib roti with arugula and mushrooms gratis - wow! Please support this place especially at dinner when chef Dan said biz is slow. The prices are amazing in a city where an average dinner cheque is prob 30% more than similar restos in LA or SF. Try 3 course lunch for $15 or dinner for $25. Honest small businesses like this deserve our support and what a yummy way to do it!"}
{"text":"The most understated gastronomical secret in downtown Toronto.

Honest, from the outside this place appears to be a shack - by which I mean a fast food/dinky lunch stop, complete with cliched sign out front. But thank god for Yelp, which led my friend and I to venture in past our sceptical judgement of the exterior, and into the land of pleasant culinary surprises that is EFBH.

You can look at the photos yourself - the food is clearly not that of a shack (to say the least), and I can affirm that it all tastes as good as it looks - plus it feels healthy! The desserts in particular were to die for (and they were healthy?! what??). And, what's more, it comes at amazing prices, considering the quality - at $25 for a 3 course prix fixe, I don't know that you can do better anywhere around. 

EFBH has wowed me, and taught me life lessons (don't judge a book by its cover - or a restaurant by its storefront, as the case may be). I will be back, as regularly as possible."}
{"text":"The food is something you'd expect at a much fancier place. I was blown away by the presentation. The watermelon mint soup came in a bowl made of ice with mint leaves frozen inside.

It looks like a fast food place, but the quality of the food is that of a much better restaurant. You do pay for it, but a bit less than an higher end restaurant, probably because of the utter lack fanciness.

There weren't many people when I was there (Saturday afternoon), I hope it picks up.

The chef was really nice too :)"}
{"text":"This place is not great!!

Came here after reading very positive reviews, and jeez was I in for a disappointing dinner. I don't know if this will mean I have to question my exploring-via-reviews strategy, but I am hoping this is simply an anomaly.

Where to start? Well, yes, reservation. Scrolling down other diners suggest making a reservation as this place is \"such a gem.\" Being a good boy, I called in around noon to book a table for 4 around 7. The guy who answered the phone claimed everything was booked and he could only accommodate us at 5:30. Who eats at five-thirty? I told him I would absolutely not make it at 5:30 and he put me down for 5:45 (!!!). Fine, I really wanted to try this excellent, amazing, fresh, high quality restaurant, so I told my party we'd better skip lunch and dine early.

Once we got there at 5:45, there were three (3!!!) other people sitting in the restaurant, and as the night progressed (we were done around 7), the place had remained 50% empty. 

Second. Food. Every item was absolutely underwhelming. They go by this $25 a seat, and you pick from a few options a starter, main, and dessert. There are 500 ml water bottles on the table (no glasses), and that should tell you something. They don't have a licence, so water it is. 

Starter. My party had caesar salad and calamari for starters. Caesar was, well, salad and the calamari was previously frozen. The calamari came with a milky sauce that was somewhat odd, also with a few leafs of arugula. 

Main. For main we all had the leg of lamb stew. It came on a huge plate, with an arrangement of vegetables. The slab of lamb was so overcooked it was like working through rubber. The arrangement of vegetables (huge pieces of broccoli, bok choi, carrot, green string beans) had not been steamed long enough (at all) and the potato mash was the size of a loony. All of this was then drizzled with a jarred-like, premade-like pasta sauce that could have been Hunt's.

Dessert. Espresso panna cotta was a gelatinous slab of something with coffee grinds on the top, surrounded with a yellow, milky sauce with the occasional pomegranate seed floating in the strange mixture.

Good value? Absolutely not! Once you fork out your 30 odd dollars for food and tips you feel like you've just been had. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have ate in the entire world. Make this a must stop location! It's small so book ahead or eat early. No bar but you don't need it, enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Eat Fresh Be Healthy is a grossly understated restuarant but deliver high quality high impact Italian and Canadiana dishes with ingredients procured from local farms and butchers. Ranked #3 of 6437 restaurants in Toronto by TripAdvisor and more than 90% rating in most major review websites, the modest surroundings and price ($25 prix fixe), belie the true gastronomic experience. We've patronized this restaurant since inception and it has never failed to deliver. We've tried everything on the menu. The braised Ontario Lamb my favorite. Ask for the humus with bread - you would see humus the same again."}
{"text":"This is a very unique restaurant. I came here with a large group and we basically took over the entire back section. It's small, so if you don't have reservations, you might be out of luck.

It offers great value in that you get a full three-course meal for $25 and the portions are massive.

I had the quail as the appetizer, which was well prepared but didn't blow me away. Next came the pork chop and it was H-U-G-E! It was like eating a 40-ounce steak. I could barely get through it, and I was hungry. The meat was tender and juicy and the seasoning complemented it well. The dessert was vanilla ice cream with some berries, which was pretty decent as well.

My only complaints are that it's pretty cramped because it's such a small restaurant and that it's unlicensed. This meal was begging for some wine to accompany it."}
{"text":"I've finally had the opportunity to come check out this restaurant!  3 course prix fixe dinner for $25 is not very common, so how good can it be?  

Appetizers: Chicken lollipops and quail.  Both were very tasty, presented nicely, and garnished with lots of fresh fruits.  They each had a unique flavour from the seasonings used.  

Mains: Liver and pork chop.  The portions were huge.  I really enjoyed the giant, double cut pork chop.  The mains were accompanied with big servings of vegetables which is fantastic.  Don't you hate it when you just get a few strands of something and nothing else?  Here, there's a little bit of everything.  Fancy carrot, green beans, white asparagus, yellow peppers, beet, and broccoli.  However, I did notice that the panko crust on the liver was a tad oily and was ever so slightly burnt.  I didn't send it back because we were just too hungry.  The liver though, was nice and tender, I hate it when liver is overcooked.  

Desserts:  Lindt chocolate ice cream and mango panna cotta.  The ice cream was bordering a soft serve texture.  I was really stuffed at this point but I still ate the panna cotta too.  

Lovely people who cook everything to order.  You might have to wait a bit, but it's worth it.  The variety of fruits and vegetables was truly impressive.  

No liquor license. Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Costs $20 for a 3 course meal for a lunch (Appetizer, Main Meal, and Dessert). The way they serve the meal is as if you're out at an expensive restaurant. Flat out amazing!"}
{"text":"Summary: Very generous portions, and great plating. Food is above average. Very casual setting. 

Pros:
-as mentioned above, plating is good (usually I don't really care about plating, but the wife is into stuff like that) 
-great value... 3 courses for $25, and the lots of fresh ingredients (fruits and veggies)
-service was good
-1st course (chicken lollipops) and desert (milk chocolate panna cotta was awesome). 



The main entree was good. Not up to the high standards of the other 2, but still very tasty. Still, the entire meal is $25, so I'm willing to let that slide. 

Another cool thing was that I could make a Saturday night reservation on a Thursday. I'm pretty sure if this place was in a better location, and at this $25, you'd need to make a reservation far in advance"}
{"text":"Two words - PURE GREATNESS. If you love super delicious food without any fancy schmancy schumuck, this is the place for you. I can't wait to go back!!

This unglamorous little restaurant with an unglamorous name serves up five-star quality food at bargain prices. The menu is a prix fixe only for $25 per person for dinner. (Lunch is $20) There is no a la carte option. 

We had grilled quail and butter chicken drumsticks for appetizer. Both were amazing. Entrees were salmon burger - so juicy and huge-portioned! - and seafood pasta - amazing tomato sauce and definitely no skimping on the seafood here!. Desserts were an enormous plate of mango panna cotta and pistacio ice cream."}
{"text":"Don't know what else to say that hasn't been said before here. First time trying this place, even though I've walked past it a thousand times. True to its reputation. Great food for great price! I can see some places charging $25 for just an appetizer, nevermind a whole 3 set course. Delicious, healthy, big portions, intimate atmosphere, and friendly service. 

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"So I went there again today for dinner with 3 of my friends and I would like to add more:

The bread was better than most of the fancy restaurants - it is served warm, and with tasty sauce (not plain butter), and has almonds in it.

The mussels are fresh and perfect in the tomato soup. Dan put fried sweet potato slices on it - which is a very healthy choice and looks quite nice.

All our entrees had very healthy ingredients: green peas mash instead of potato mash in the Chicken Supreme, lots of asparagus in the penne, at least 3 kinds of mushrooms in my mushroom risotto - they are not expensive or fancy but all very fresh. The portions are so large none of us could finish our entree.

Dan recognized me immediately and didn't charge me extra for the added chicken in my risotto. Then he offered us tiramisu on the house - which is not too sweet and enjoyed by us all.

I would definitely become a regular here. Eager to try out some sandwiches and the chef's choice!"}
{"text":"BEST kept secret in Toronto!!!! This tiny restaurant has 20 seats and is a real jewel. For only 25$ chef Dan will serve you a 3 course meal BETTER than almost any 5-star restaurant. Portions are large, presentation creative and combinations surprising (salmon and strawberry, shrimp and pomegranate...WOW!!!). Will be back....maybe tomorrow....or maybe every day :)"}
{"text":"We tried this spot on a whim and were truly impressed. Lovely family, limited menu of high grade selections, 3 course prepared meal. 

The quirky name, the intimate setting, no art on the walls and open kitchen created such an interesting vibe. We walked out beyond content and honestly happy to come back again. 

Delicious."}
{"text":"Five star food and service, for bargain prices. Truly blown away! Favorite place in Toronto. Eat here, you won't be disappointed. 

Exceptional food! Fresh, made to order, and locally grown/raised. Presentation is gorgeous, meals are filling, and nice selection.  Taste combinations were exciting and I savor end every bite. I'm not normally a fan of healthy or organically focused food, but it was so delicious that I couldn't even tell/care. This is really on a level of the top restaurants in town ( a number of which the head chef worked at)

Best part? Comparatively dirt cheap for some of the best food in town. 20 bucks for a three course meal (2-4 options to chose from per course) for lunch, 25 for dinner. You'd easily pay double that for similar food at other high end restaurants elsewhere in the city. I had the quail for appetizer, pork chop for entree, and ice cream for dessert, exceptionally pleased with all 3.

Staff is extremely helpful And friendly, obviously invested in you having a good experience. Location is a little random, but easy to get a seat for lunch, (though make reservations for dinner a few days in advance as it sells out quick)"}
{"text":"Had a 3-course lunch meal here. The portions were so big I could not finish my lunch and had to get the rest to go. I got the calamari for app, pork chop for main and the lindt ice cream. They were all very very good. Nicely presented and tasted amazing. Service was also really good."}
{"text":"Im so glad this place is getting hype they totally deserve it. Ive been here twice and had the most amazing meals. The food is unpretentious, generous portions, just incredible flavors and textures. Theyve managed to merge the comfort of home cooking with the quality of a high class restaurant and you honestly cant go wrong. This place is awesome give it a try!"}
{"text":"The price is very good for what you get, and the food is better than average with good sized portions.  I went in April so I can't remember the exact names of the items on the menu.  But I had a crabcake, chicken, and lindt ice cream.  My friend had the lamb and it was a very large portion.  The place could probably use a little better decor, you feel like you are in a high school cafeteria, so not really a place where you want to bring a date or anything, more for casual eats. Also they have no liquor license, so made it feel even more like a high school cafeteria.  But once again, for $25, it is a good deal, food was good!"}
{"text":"Wow is the first word that comes to mind.    The food is amazing and delicious.  The owners are wonderful.   I didn't want to leave!   You would never expect this level of quality to come from such an unassuming place.  Our table was next to the window, and it was hilarious to see passers-by doing a double-take as they walked past and saw the food on our plates.  I could even read the lips of one woman who said \"Did you see that food?\" to her friend as they were walking by.  I've found my new go-to place whenever I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place. The price is beyond reasonable for freshly made food, none the less for a restaurant mid downtown corridor. The staff were amazing, friendly and super knowledgeable about their food. You truly get the feel that they are dedicated to their mission and have a strong vision of what good food and service is. The menu items are easy to understand and straight-forward, the choices are all scrumptious. The portion is reasonable and presentation of the food on point. The restaurant looks simple and relaxed, yet the food is the selling point to impress patron. Come early or set a reservation as food portion run out fast. A local favourite in the area and busy during the lunch time rush. Their food, to our taste, was a bit heavy handed on the salt but was not any less appealing. The pasta was on point with flavor and texture. The chicken was nicely prepared though the pork chop was a bit rough for my taste. Overall, I loved the concept, the value and the restaurant. I am very eager to recommend it to friends as hasn't disappointed me yet. Will try coming back for their dinner set as well. I hope that they are here to stay as it their presence is very much welcomed."}
{"text":"I came here for a Meetup and they graciously shut down the restaurant for our crew of 35 to 40 people.  

It was $25 for a full three course meal. This is a bit over my budget as my limit is usually $20 before taxes but i have to admit this was great value.  

Order: Mussels in white wine tomato sauce broth (appy), Cajun blackened salmon with fresh fruits on top and veggies on the side (entree) and espresso panna cotta (dessert).

Likes:
-The white wine tomato sauce broth was delicious.  As my dining neighbour said \"Broth is so good, I'm literally licking the bowl\".
-Everything was extremely fresh ( and is locally sourced).
-Largest portions I've ever seen for a prix-fixe menu.
-They aren't cheap and for the fruit toppings, they give you fancy fruits too such as Dragon fruit.
-I'm not the best picture taker and my photo's don't do this place justice, but presentation is beautiful.
-Service is very friendly.
-Open kitchen.  You see all the cooks make all the food in front of you.

Dislikes:
-While the salmon was amazingly fresh, it wasn't spicy enough for blackened food.  

Yeah that was my only dislike.

Verdict: Though it doesn't look like much from the outside, this is definitely one of the better \" fancy food \" places in Toronto and I'd visit again."}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the reviews I have read on Yelp!  I liked the sound of a homey yet delicious place that would give me take out food and was near my hotel.  
When I arrived there, I was greeted personably by one of the owners and introduced to the other.  Not only did they go out of their way to help me but they gave me an outstanding dinner experience for a ridiculously low price.  Had I been able to dine in I could have had my choice of many tempting options from a fixed menu.  The three course meal was only $25.00!!  Instead I had take out and chose the salmon with fruit salsa.  I loved it.  It was tender and tasty and beautifully presented (even for take out!).  
It is obvious that the owners genuinely like people and love good food.  They share those passions with their lucky patrons.
I would return, if only to have a chance to try the raspberry bread pudding with chocolate sauce!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Wednesday night before heading to AGO and there was no lineup. We were greeted nicely by the hostess who showed us to the table and explained the menu items to us. Meals here are offered as a prix-fixed menu at $25 for a 3 course meal all year long. She warned us that dishes are made to order to expect to wait a little. I wasn't bothered by that since it meant fresh meals. 

I ordered the calamari, seafood special and espresso panna cotta. Calamari was okay but that \"meh\" vibe was quickly masked by how good the seafood special was. It came as a seafood mix (shrimp, calamari, blue crab) with a nice stock base. Very seafoody so it may not be for those who aren't a fan of fishiness. However, for those who are, it's bomb. The portions were surprisingly filling (maybe because I also drank all the soup... #hangrymodeon) I had little to no room for the dessert. From the few tastes I had, it was refreshing and light, overall nicely made."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. Eat fresh looks like another dundas restaurant but I was really impressed with food. Came here with the family and even though the pizza wasn't available (they couldn't get the pizza oven through the door), the were quick to offer something for the kids made to order. Everything was fresh and tasty and they have a good deal (that sells out fast) after 2:30 on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Very fresh seafood soup and overall, food and service are pretty good with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"From the name, I thought it would be more of a salad bar or something similar to Fresh - casual and quick. But it's actually a small and cozy restaurant with a prix fixe 3-course menu ($25 for dinner and $20 for lunch).

My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday evening and ordered the Spicy Chicken Drumsticks and Crispy Calamari to start. They weren't joking when they said spicy. The spices and aroma of the chicken was a jerky flavor but the accompanying fruits help balance the dish. I was pleasantly surprised that persimmons and apples worked so well with the chicken. The Calamari was perfect - not too greasy, paired with the perfect sauce (Scallion Yogurt) and beautifully presented. 

For entrees we had the Braised Leg of Lamb and Mushroom and the Maple Mustard Glazed Double Cut Pork Chop both served with mash potato and vegetables. These are apparently the two most popular items. Mash potatoes were phenomenal. The pork chop was humongous and although it was well-seasoned, the cut was really thick which made the meat a bit tough. Crispy and juicy on the outer but I thought the middle was a little dry. As for the lamb, I'm not a huge fan of braised meat but I can't deny that it was delicious. The vegetables are also large in size; probably the biggest bokchoy I've ever eaten. 

Last but not least, dessert. SO SO GOOD. I'm still thinking about their Mango Panna Cotta. I loved the texture and taste. It's a must-try! The Lindt Chocolate icecream served with a wafer and mixed fruits like dragonfruit and blueberries was great too. So creamy and rich. 
 
Helmed by Chef Dan who has previously worked at Jump and Canoe, it is not a surprise that the presentation of every dish is absolutely superb. Ingredients are fresh and portions are very generous. Service was attentive and courteous. Bang for your buck. All in all, judge the food, not the atmosphere/decor (and the bottled water) and you will leave this place full and happy."}
{"text":"I came here after sampling their food at a friend's catered event and it was superb.

The restaurant is located close to University Ave and Dundas St.  It occupies a very unassuming location on the Dundas strip. The ambiance isn't anything to write home about.  It's a bit on the casual side but it is clean.

Dinner is offered prix-fixe style.  For $25, you're given a Naya water bottle, an appetizer, main and dessert.

We started off with leek and potato soup topped with some prosciutto garnish.  The soup was fantastic.  We were also treated to the calamari (as they ran out of one of the dishes) and it was fantastic.  Despite being fried, it didn't feel too oily; the calamari was served with what seemed like a yogurt-based dip which was delicious.

The main was a pasta dish served with chicken drumsticks and vegetables in a white wine sauce.  I'll be honest, it was a weird combination of food but it was still quite good.  The noodles were perfectly al dente and the white wine sauce was tasty.  The combination of vegetables and drumsticks was unconventional but overall I finished the dish satisfied. 

Finally, dessert was a Lindt-based ice cream garnished with fruits and topped with a thin wafer.  A nice way to end the meal.

Service was excellent.  The waiter was really attentive. Five stars."}
{"text":"I walked by this place many, many times but never tried until I went to dinner with a group of friends. This place is very small and the decor isn't very impressive. But the food is good. Their menu is a set menu, so I had an appetizer,  an entry, and desert. The food portion for the price they charged is a good deal. The only thing that I didn't really like was the fact the kitchen was an open kitchen as the space wasn't very big so at the end you kind of smell like the kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm really impress to have dinner at this restaurant. Every meal have a lot of veggies,also a lot of kind of veggies!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  They mainly offer a fixed price but for groups, they offer shared dishes. On this night, my friend and I chose the fixed price menu.  Each of us had different choices and shares some items. The decor is nothing special but the food and service made up for it.

For appetizers, some of us picked quail while others chose soup or calamari.  I tried the quail and it was delicious. It was a great start to the evening.

Most of us chose the pasta, pork chop or liver as the main dish. I chose the blue crab as I was thinking it was different but it was a messy experience.  The pork chop was actually nicely done and the portions were generous.  

Dessert was a choice between mango panna cotta or strawberry sorbet.  The panna cotta was refreshing and I quickly ate all of it.  Overall, the experience was excellent.  Too bad they don't change the menu often.  For $25, it is absolutely a great deal.  I will be back once they announce a new menu but definitely worth checking out as the food / decor give a homey feeling."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday dinner with a big group of people (17 in total). The birthday girl called the day before and reservations were easy to make for a Saturday night.

Since we had such a big group, I was able to see every dish their menu had to offer. Portions here are generous and tasty!

Our server (the owner?) warned us in the beginning that everything is made to order so it does take some time. A few dishes (3-4) would come out at once so it took a while to serve all 17 people. This was understandable as the restaurant is small and there are only 3 people working in the kitchen.

Food - 4/5. I had the squash bisque to start and the salmon w/ mashed potatoes and veggies for the main. Both dishes were good and I would recommend. Boyfriend got the pork chop which was juicy and well-cooked and the Lindt chocolate ice cream which was creamy and delicious. Other plates in our party looked good as well and people seemed happy with their food. We were also impressed with their plating. Everything was visually interesting.

Ambience - 3/5. Pretty casual and not much in terms of décor but everything was clean. I wouldn't recommend if you wanted a romantic dinner, but a good place to come with friends or for a casual meal (even though the food is fancy!).

Servce - 4/5. The staff here were nice and accommodating. We were able to switch up our protein in our entrees. For example, the lamb dish came with mashed potatoes and veggies, while the salmon came with a salad. I was able to get the salmon w/ the mash and the veggies instead of the salad which I appreciated. 

Notes:
Bills were easily split which made the paying process easy (sometimes a nightmare with large groups). Note that this place is CASH ONLY.

I think they only serve water (bottled, from Costco). No coffee, liquor or other drinks I could see. There's only 1 bathroom - something to keep in mind if you're here with a large group.

Overall, I would come back again if I were in the area. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant for good food."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant to try when meeting up with a friend I only see once every few months. The reviews on yelp and the picture of the crab Caesar salad sealed the deal for me!

We had the calamari and caesar salad and both were so good we started stealing each other's appetizers. 

For mains we both got our lamb ribs, his was fattier than mine, but both were extremely flavorful and delicious. The portions were great, he had to help me finish mine!

For dessert we had the panna cotta which my friend didn't like due to the texture (his first time having it) and I loved because of the texture and flavors!

Their menu changes all the time though so I'm excited to go back and try different dishes. 

The atmosphere was friendly but I have to say a bit strange because the inside looked less italian and more cafeteria style or pop up type feel. 

But you can't beat the value of great food you get for $25!"}
{"text":"- Fantastic food presentation
- Excellent service
- Decor is severely lacking

For some reason, the decor of this establishment betrays the quality of food which it serves. The food was well decorated with very generous portions of greens and fruits. I feel very guilty for unwrapping the chef's intricate work! All this great food is in steep contrast with the decor however. The lighting are all spot lights but it does not reach the food giving them a very blend and stale look. The menu is printed black and white on cheap 8.5x11 paper which also doubles as a table mat. Washroom's are clean, I think, but there was a lot noise coming from the uncovered ceiling light. Oh yeah, one piece of cloth separates the dish washing area with the washroom entrances. 

What a pity because the food belongs in a 5 star hotel!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants. The food tastes amazing, the price is good and it feels like it's homemade. I've seen a lot of restaurants claim their food is just like homemade but it's rarely ever true. This place really does serve healthy food that tastes amazing. I recommend the chicken dinner."}
{"text":"What a total hidden gem. This place shocked us to pieces.  The yelp description of italian/indian is off base though, since it is pure fusion, but that was the only misnomer.  The surrounds are unassuming, and it isn't licensed, but it is one of the best restaurants in the city....the dinner menu is prix fix for $25 (app, entree and dessert) and each is served with so much glam.  The veggies are unique, and paired with each plate to accentuate the meat or seafood, but there are great vegetarian options too.   Everyone there were regulars. We will be back for sure.  Get a dinner rez or you will have to wait since the place is small."}
{"text":"Terrific service and food at a very afforadable price! The restaurant is very small and is not well decorated but it serves one of the best meals in Toronto."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here last night and we couldn't believe the incredible value we received.  For $25 per person, we we were treated to an incredible three course pre-fixe menu, each featuring creative, well-presented dishes with generous portions. (Note: EFBH does not have a liquor license, so you won't be able to pair your meal with anything alcoholic)

My appetizer was a quail cocktail of sorts, featuring an assortment of fruit and berries.  My main was a healthy piece of crack rub spice chicken supreme which lived up to the hype, and the dessert was a light coconut panna cotta with roasted butternut squash.  The meal was extremely tasty and filling, but without that awful feeling that you indulged in something bad for you.

Over the course of our meal, our server was always checking in with us, asking about the food, topping us up with water, adjusting the temperature as needed -- so we felt very well attended to.

Afterwards I had a chance to chat with Chef Dan, who told me that business has been up and down in the year and a half that they've been in operating, but they've managed to some regular patrons from the hospitals in the area.   The problem appears to be that this restaurant is nestled between several fast food establishments and, as such, most passersby aren't really tempted by a fresh three course meal prepared by a gourmet chef, even if it is incredible well priced -- which is a shame, because they are missing out on a foodie delight at bargain basement pricing.

Chef Dan also mentioned that they also provide catering (both within the restaurant and elsewhere) services and have catered groups of 20 for as little as $200 (unbelievable) and large 1200-person Italian weddings with a 9 course meal.

I can't wait for an opportunity to eat here again and impress friends with this hidden gem."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago during the Summerlicious craze and I ended up coming back here time and time again because the food is consistent, and the service is fantastic. Don't be fooled by the interior decor, it almost looks like a cheap cafeteria, but they are a no-frills sort of place where their main focus is just on serving you good food using local ingredients.

I have come here a number of times and tried a bunch of different entrees: salmon, pork, lamb, and liver. The pork was my definite favourite. The lamb for me was a little too salty, and while the liver had great flavour, I don't think a large chunk of liver makes a good steak - the taste of liver becomes a bit too much when you eat a big portion of it. The entrees come with a lot of vegetables, which isn't seasoned very much (or at all even) to balance out the flavour of the entrees - although some might think it's a little *too* bland.

Overall though, I would still be happy to eat any of the dishes again- and their portions are quite generous. Their appetizers were always good - had the quail once and that was fantastic, the soft-shelled crab has a nice flavour, and their spicy fried chicken has a good kick to it. Both of their dessert choices - the panna cotta and the Lindt chocolate ice cream (so so good if you like chocolate ice cream) - make you want to come back here just for the desserts. The food isn't necessary going to be presented in a way that'll get you hundreds of likes on Instagram, but at the end of the day, that's not what food is for.

The price of this place is a big attractive factor. I have no idea how this place profits with such generous portions for only $25 for a 3-course meal. Everyone who works here seems to really value what they do, and it's always a pleasure to stop by when I have a chance. Just don't judge this place right away when your menu comes printed on a red 8 1/2 by 11 paper, which later doubles as your place mat - It's all about the food."}
{"text":"Very impressed.  Fixed Price Menu... 
All the dishes were made with love.  Delicious, well presented, and a healthy portion.  Price is just right... :)"}
{"text":"My friend rented out the entire restaurant for a birthday party on Saturday. While the name of the restaurant and decor doesn't suggest it, this place is really 5 star gourmet dining at a 3 star price! For $25 + tax and tip you get a 3 course meal! This is not food court grab and dash food.  I am not exaggerating when I call this 5 star dining.  Chef Dan's unique perspective on using only the best ingredents which includes fresh fruit and veggies with every course is truly a treat. I started with tempura shrimp which was so good, I had to get a second order.  My wife got the quail which was also very tasty.  For our mains, we had the double cut pork chop and the veal scallopini. Both came with veggies and mashed potatoes with gravy. My pork chop was slightly more done than I would have preferred and the veal had a little more breading than my wife would have liked, but the amount of flavor infused into food more than made up for the small nitpicks we had. The size of the pork chop was definitely a sight to behold. For dessert, we had Lindt chocolate ice cream and pomegranate panna cotta. Both were served with fresh fruit and were equally delicious. While this is my first time here, I will definitely be making several return visits."}
{"text":"This  restaurant was recommended by the trip advisor but I think it is overrated. I went there with a friend at Friday evening. There was not very busy and we seat beside the open kitchen where was a little smoky.

Only one lady serviced us with a menu of dinner set which cost 25 before tax. I chose the lamb with mushrooms sauce as the main dish and my friend chose the pork rib which was almost same as mine in the shape. Vegetable was fresh but not very savory and the size of salad was so small. Specially, I want to mention that the crispy crust of the pork was delicious but the meat was so tough!! Not as good as lamb. Btw, I felt so regret to choose the ice cream and sorbet as  dessert but not the cotta. 

The atmosphere was just so so. And the window really need to be cleaned... It made the restaurant look like terrible."}
{"text":"I wanted to come here all winterlicious but was just too busy and thought I would leave it for the summer. But after talking about it the day before winterlicious was over, I just HAD to go. So made the right choice. 
The name might sound really lame, but honestly the food here is in decent proportions served beautifully and tastes amazing on top of that. 
They're a quaint restaurant serving you water in plastic water bottles, and being a restaurant with a small capacity. But the service is so great and it's really a hidden gem for any foodie. 

Going for lunch, this is what me and my boyfriend got:
Calamari: not greasy at all. Perfectly size with a great sauce 
Soup of the day: it was some sort of pumpkin bisque but it was just so thick and creamy and well.. Good. 

Pork Loin: normally I'm not a fan of pork, but this was just soooo juicy. I've never tasted anything like it. And it also LOOKED good. Ah my stomach's rumbling now. 
Portobello Mushroom:  mushrooms and goat cheese? yes. Always and forever yes. It's an amazing combo and you'd regret not trying it. 

Espresso Pudding: it's drowned in mango sauce and looks exquisite. The espresso itself is simple and not too sweet. I really liked it and I'm not a sweets person. 
Berry Sorbet: really loved the presentation and also the sorbet itself. Yes it's minus fourth outside, but this sorbet was so easy to eat because it tastes good and YOH can justify you're pretty much being healthy by eating berries. 

Overall this place was amazing. Plating, taste and service was great. I guess the only thing is maybe they should have wifi/serve hot drinks, but other than that, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"so I had such HIGH hopes for this place...
it was nothing like we expected. The menu on their website is very misleading! The actual menu has less than half of what's listed online.

It appeared to be more of an indian restaurant. 
I'm not sure what everyone is raving about? we had to leave. We kept double checking if we had the right restaurant..."}
{"text":"They have the nicest display of food! The chef takes his time to cook up the meals - service was excellent. We were told it would take some time for our meal to be ready ahead of time. 

We ordered from the set menu which gives us two choices (for appetizer, main and dessert) to choose from; we ordered one of each. I believe they change up the menu often for variety.

Appetizers: Crab cake & Chicken thigh  - the sauce on the chicken thigh was marinated very well.

Main: Seafood platter & Cajun Salmon with Fruit Salsa  - I like the seafood platter more :)

Desserts: Pistachio ice cream & Panna Cotta 

Overall, the food was excellent - my dessert, in particular, was AMAZINGGG... I haven't had yummy pistachio ice cream in a long time :*) I was so happy with my dessert!!"}
{"text":"Very large portions 3 course meal for $25 / person. The mussels, salmon, and lamb were all decent. Didn't enjoy the veal and panna cotta as much. The spaghetti with shrimp appetizer seemed a bit out of place on the menu, esp when there is a seafood pasta option in the entree. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting a place across from where I work called Eat Fresh Be Healthy. I was impressed with the sandwiches I had taken away from there, especially considering all the other choices between Yonge Street and University Avenue, along Dundas Street West. The food was fresh, flavourful, and quite delicious. They are priced about a $1 to $1.50 more than many other choices, but the quality is evident and kept me going back for more. 
So when friend suggested lunch in the area I offered it up as one of the choices (others had been Somethin' 2 Talk About, The Queen and Beaver, Japango). I was able to provide a link for menu or review for the other choices, so I went looking for something on Eat Fresh Be Healthy. I came across the Yelp listing that also outlined the Chef's experience and philosophy (has trained in some of the top restaurants of the city, and believes in local fresh ingredients for his food). In words, these were the reasons I had kept going back. His experience and knowledge of food is evident in the meals I had consumed, as well as the quality of his ingredients. 
We decided on that place for lunch and it was to be my first dine-in experience of the place. 
As usual, engaging the chef was easy, explaining my allergy to onions provided a quick list (with a very sincere apology) of food that I could not have, as well as an offer to adjust what could be adjusted (The special Striploin and vegetables over pasta in a Rose sauce was out -as the sauce had onions-, but the port cutlet sandwich with caramelised onions was ok as her would make one fresh without the onions).The chef describing his menu choices and specials was similar to listening to a teenager espouse on about their first romance. His love of food is that transparent and fervent. His manner is gracious, almost to a fault, stopping just short of ingratiating. His delivery and speech is careful, thoughtful, empathic, full of care and love of his food. He really, really wants to feed you, and feed you well. 
He had explained on a previous occasion that he could not make me a sandwich, when I popped down one late afternoon as all the fresh baked bread for the day was gone, and made me a wrap instead. To make up for the lack of bread I was given 2 cookies with the explanation that it was nearing the end of the lunch sales and they would not last the day, as they are baked fresh daily as well. 
So I am convinced that everything is fresh, well sourced, well prepared and assembled with care. 
I chose the Pork cutlet sandwich and my friend opted for a spinach salad. 
My sandwich was delicious, the pork moist, the bread spongy, and the flavours well combined. The side salad accompanying it was a spinach salad in a simple light vinaigrette that allowed the natural flavours to come through and very abundantly dressed with grapes, red beets, pickled radish, roasted almonds, and julienned carrots. 
My friend's \"simple spinach salad\" covered a large leaf shaped plate and was very much a dinner portion of Spinach, cherries, blueberries, grapes, star fruit, strawberries, pickled radish, roasted almonds, and julienned carrots (I may have even missed a couple of ingredients). She reported that the flavours were delightful. 

This place has lunch entrees in addition to the sandwiches and salads, as well as a full dinner menu on Thursday to Saturday, and brunch on weekends. I am definitely going back for dinner and plan on a brunch soon as well. 

When I go out to eat my focus is the food. If the food is good, many other things are forgivable or irrelevant. However, I feel that in the interest of full disclosure I should point out that the décor is Spartan and not the most attractive. The service consists of the Chef himself and a person that seems to be his wife. During a busy period I am sure that when they get a little slammed, service is slow. She is also clearly not trained as a server and is constantly going to the Chef for clarifications, as well as slipping up on a simple server etiquette (refreshing water, checking in, prompt bill delivery when plates are cleaned or put aside). Both of these points are irrelevant to me. Hell I'll eat standing at the counter and happily serve myself. 

Note to vegetarians: I have not tried the vegetarian options (and there seems to be more than salad - a sandwich or two, couple of pastas, and couple of entrees), but I am sure they are just as good. Also, remember that this Chef is only too happy to customise and cater to special requests (at least during non peak hours, when I go)."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. The presentation and taste of the food here is excellent. Everything is served as if it's a high class restaurant, but you get a large enough portion so that you're full when you leave :D 

The environment is the only thing that doesn't match with everything else. We were served with water bottles and our menus became our placemats. If you want high quality food for a decent price and don't mind the casual environment, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The hype is real!! Amazing food for a very reasonable price. $25 for a prix fixe 3 course dinner. They are very generous with their portions and you will leave feeling like you just had a feast. Presentation of the food is also instagram worthy. However, the decor of the restaurant is sort of like a family owned diner so it is probably not the best place to go if you want to impress a date. But hey, who needs to impress a date when you can impress your tummy with food thats beautiful and delicious."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch. This place is easily one of Toronto's best-kept secrets! Got the spinach and arugula salad and the brown butter sauteed shrimp quesadilla. Was served both in what I would consider record time, along with a nice big helping of red pepper and onion foccacia with a homemade red wine hummus as a dip...And everything I just listed was FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"Came for dinner thanks to the consistently great reviews on Yelp.

It is a very small place near Dundas and University. From the outside, you would never think of going in and getting the kind of food that they serve there. Even from the inside you still wouldn't expect being served the kind of food that they serve there. Although I do promise that this isn't just another review with only great things to say, I do have a couple of complaints.

How it works is they set up a prix fixe menu of a three course dinner for $25 ($20 for lunch) and it seems that they will change it on their Facebook site (https://www.facebook.com/eatfreshbehealthy), every couple of months or so. I guess it could be a down side that you are forced to choose from a small list but for the price and quality of the food, I honestly wouldn't worry too much since they have a bit of everything for everyone. 

I had Chef Dan's Crispy Chicken Lollipops with Ontario Peach Slaw and my friend had the Crispy Calamari served with Scallion Yogurt. Can I say that the presentation of the food is beautiful and you can see the hard work they put into each dish. The appetizers were very flavourful and abundant. The chicken drumsticks were pretty spicy and I liked how crispy it was (even the bone was crispy.. mmm) and the slaw was very refreshing. My friend got a ton of calamari and they were not greasy at all. I guess my only complaint was that from looking at other Yelpers' pictures of their chicken, my drumsticks looked kind of small.

For our entrees, I ordered the Maple Mustard Glazed Pork Chop and my friend got the Spicy Calamari and Shrimp Pasta tossed with Market Vegetable and White Wine Tomato Broth. Everybody has said how gigantic the piece of pork was and I can attest to that, BUT because it was so thick it appeared that mine was not completely cooked all the way through. I did not see anybody else complain about this but it was a little concern of mine (although I am still alive so I guess it's all good). There were a variety of vegetables that accompanied my dish (green beans, bok choy, asparagus, carrot, pickled beet, yellow bell pepper) and some buttery mashed potatoes. My friend liked her dish as well as there were many pieces of shrimp and calamari although she felt it wasn't hot enough and it was a bit too salty for her tastes.

For dessert we both got the Alfonso Mango Panna Cotta and at that point we were both super stuffed but it looked so delicious that we could not just let it sit there unappreciated. It was so smooth and mango-ey. There was not a better way to end our dinner. 

Their service is very friendly and they prepare their food with a lot of care. Another thing that I wanted to mention that I did not see some of the recent reviews complain about was after our meal when my friend and I got home, we felt very thirsty. And I thought, there's no way they would use MSG in their food especially considering the name of the restaurant and the way they cook their food in their open kitchen. 

Overall I enjoyed the food though (minus my undercooked pork which is never good) but I would totally give them another chance and go again simply for their unique taste, beautiful presentation and great price. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The service is ok. Indian lady was nice , but the food , was really disappointed, wondering how they got those 4-5 stars ."}
{"text":"Two words: Hidden Gem

That's a phrase I don't often throw around lightly, but this place hits the mark.  It's a $25 prix fixe 3-course meal for dinner, and it was pretty rocking good.  Just to clarify, this is \"fine dining\" in the food only...it's pretty casual in other aspects.  That's fine, I don't need fancy table settings, expensive upholstery, and pompous service when the food is great.

Some dishes we had:
Apps:
--Chicken Lollipops: Tasty nicely fried, lightly-breaded chicken served with a sauce including passionfruit.  Basically quite-fancy fried-chicken.
--Crispy shrimp cake: Basically one very large shrimp sauteed in a cake form and breaded.  Generally good, but not oustanding.
Entrees:
--Seafood Platter: It looked small, but it was delicious.  The \"lobster\" tail was actually squat lobster not Atlantic lobster, but who cares, it tasted amazing.  One scallop, which was awesome...could have used one more ;)  Couple tasty shrimp.  Lots of nice veggies
--Lamb Stew:  Just a beautiful flavor!
Desserts:
--Pistachio Ice Cream: The ice cream itself was lovely.  Real pistachios were harmed in the making ;)  Some of the fruit toppings on the top didn't really go with it, like the pomegranate seeds.
--Milk Chocolate Panna Cotta: I normally hate milk chocolate, but I could not stop stealing my boyfriend's panna cotta.  It was bathed in an absolutely luscious saffron cardamom broth...my mouth just started watering...pardon me for a second.

The best plating I have ever seen at this price point.  See the photos...everything was visually stunning.

The service was casual, perfectly paced, and incredibly friendly.  Decor is pretty simple and the storefront is basic.  No liquor license yet and no BYOB unless you rent the whole place and get a permit.  

Overall, it was excellent at this price point.  A real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Good food for the price and an excellent value at $25 for three courses. Ambience is terrible and they don't serve alcohol. Don't come for a first date."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, and excellent service.  The waitress/host explained everything so well and frequently came to the table and ask if we need anything.  The only downside for me is that they don't serve wines along with their foods :("}
{"text":"Omg I had this amazing big dish of blue crab!it is sooooo good!we also order chicken lollipops,quail,salmon burger,everything is delicious!highly recommend and will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is a great little, nondescript restaurant downtown which obviously focused on the food and service (awesome, awesome!) instead of spending time and money on the decor (non-existent).

About 15 of us from the office went for lunch and took up most of the seats (not sure if there was more seating upstairs).  The menu options were all good as I got to try a bit of everything from others.

The service was friendly, attentive and for the most part, quick.  It really felt like a family restaurant.  The only *small* issue was that one table (we took up two) got their courses about 5 minutes ahead of the other so they were done by the time we got our dessert.

It was a couple of months ago so I can't recall the dishes but I think they were all indian cuisine inspired but definitely fusion with other flavours and some were completely unexpected.  Some of my colleagues are indian and they enjoyed the dishes as well but they said it was not the flavours they expected from the descriptions.

I would highly recommend this place if you like indian but also like to try new, unexpected flavours.  If you're in the mood for butter chicken, I suggest you go to a \"regular\" indian restaurant instead."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, the food here is fresh and seems quite healthy. Portions and good and presentation is beautiful. We shared chicken lollipops and tomato bisque to start, then got the build your own salmon filet burgers, and the mango panna cotta for dessert. Everything was delicious, the mango panna cotta outstandingly so. As other reviewers have noted, the dining room won't be winning any design awards, but the quality and value ($20 three course lunch, $25 three course dinner) here are fantastic."}
{"text":"Every plate in this restaurant is an absolute work of art. Almost too beautiful to eat! Food was excellent and the Mango Panna Cotta was to die for! Definitely was worth the trip in from the burbs! My only critique would be that there is no bar. Wish I had a nice glass of wine to accompany such an excellent meal..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very fresh and delicious!

We tried their price-fixed dinner for $25. I had the crispy calamari for appetizer, seafood pasta and pistachio ice cream for desert. Everything was amazingly refreshing! 

The waitress (owner?) was very friendly and attentive. Can't wait for their new menu. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at this restaurant. There were only two tables around 6 pm for dinner, the food was served very quickly. We were given two bottles of spring water, instead of glasses ( which was a little strange and not very environmentally friendly)...

My friend and I opted for the pre fixe menu ( $25) : I had crispy calamari for appetizer and pan seared salmon with salad for main ( my friend had half a lobster with brown butter and crab cake) and white chocolate espresso panna cotta to finish:)

Some reviews mentioned the calamari was over salted, which was not the case for us. It was quite balanced with the yogurt sauce. The salmon was cooked to perfection in my opinion, but the arugula salad was not as exciting..:( I thought it needed a lot more dressing) The dessert was great. Each bite tasted luxurious:) 
The portion was huge with each course. Good thing both us were starving!!

The only improvement I wish to see at this place was the lighting ( the white light felt very clinical) and perhaps some decor to make it feels more welcoming."}
{"text":"Absolutely refreshing experience...The simple menu choices makes eating dinner not a complicated affair especially when you've had a long day at work, but an easy and pleasant one. There's nothing as refreshing as starting with a nice bowl of tomato bisque, light in texture with a sweet undertone. Left me waiting for my next course...which of was pan seared salmon...I was watching my meal being prepared...and surely my dish showed up to my table in no time. If I were to judge by looks alone this was going to get 5 stars, however after the first few bites...nothing but affirmation that these guys know exactly what they are doing. The simplicity of the salmon garnished with vegetables was a compliment to the first course. The salmon was paired with a five vegetable pasta with a basil pesto sauce....I am not one for combining Salmon and pasta, however the pairing worked here...the vegetables brought all the flavors together to make this one balance entrée. I was left struggling to find room for my dessert (Mango Panna Cotta).  The dessert was pleasant but that's me being slightly biased. Anything that taste like custard to me always gets a pass.  
The icing on the cake is that I was able to enjoy all this for just $25.....I'll be coming back for sure!
Thanks Bernard for recommending"}
{"text":"So good and so sad this place closed up. I don't understand why they didn't have more people visiting. My guess is the price (probably looking at ~$20+). But the quality of the food is amazing!!! The portions are huge and the food is absolutely delicious. All made right there with local ingredients. Every time I went, the appetizers, the entree were huge! So so worth and it breaks my heart to see them go :(
If they ever re-open, I'll be sure to go back!"}
{"text":"Have you ever really wanted to like a restaurant and even questioned your taste palate, because of the rave reviews from Yelp and your friends? Sadly Eat Fresh Be Healthy is one of those restaurants. As far as I recall, that day I kept tasting and tried to analyze the flavours of each plate, simply because I thought there was something wrong with my taste buds. 

Altogether it was an okay meal, not spectacular or awful. The presentation was a miss, but the flavors of all the dishes were done well, just the execution and final touches were not there. The portion was generous for the price that I paid for, and service was top-notch.

-Caesar Salad garnish with Crispy Blue Crab: My friend ended up pouring the salad onto the plate, because the mug was so inconvenient when you try to reach for the salad at the bottom. The crab was just there for presentation, and there was barely any meat in it. The caesar salad was good though, the dressing was light, seasoned nicely with just the right amount of cheese.

-Crispy Calamari serves with Scallion Yogurt: the sauce on the plate made the dish look messy and greasy. The chef also put the sauce in a shot glass, which was located in the middle of the calamari and it was delicious! But why put it in the shot glass?! The calamari was perfectly crispy and seasoned, despite the odd pairing of the yogurt sauce and calamari, I liked the combination! The yogurt dip was refreshing and balanced the fatty deep fried calamari.

-Ontario Braised Leg of Lamb: My friend and I both got leg of lamb as our main and we were disappointed. First, we expected to get an actual leg of lamb, instead we received two bone pieces covered in sauce. The vegetables were lightly steamed, but too undercooked and under-seasoned for us to try. The mashed potatoes were okay...not memorable. The star of this dish, the \"leg\" of lamb was a tad overcooked, which resulted in dry and tough pieces of meat. Having said that, the sauce was flavorful and aromatic, I wish they served some bread on the side to dip in all that delicious sauce.

-Double Espresso Panna Cotta: The texture was creamy and smooth, a bit too \"wobbly\" for me, but the sweetness was perfect with the rich espresso flavour, a very delightful dessert. The \"soup\" was a coconut-based soup I believe, with some pomegranate here and there.

-Lindt Chocolate Ice-Cream: friend said the texture of the ice cream is more of a soft-serve, and it wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"OMG, what a wonderful find.  My 5 stars is based on any other option where you would attempt to get a appetizer, entrée, dessert combo for $25. Yes, I'm sure 3 course meals at the highest end restaurants can out shine some of these; though I wouldn't expect many to beat the Alfonso Mango Panna Cotta desert we had there. WOW!

Some call it cramped, I would call it intimate with the kitchen and cooks embedded right in the dining area.  So fun to see the 3 chefs having fun creating their amazing looking and tasting dishes.  

Absolute small downside was no wine (or beer) but no worries as the food and ambiance stood well on their own.

I agree it may not be Italian but not sure if I'm qualified to reach that conclusion.  Certainly don't do there thinking pasta, tomato and alfredo sauces, and cheese."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and of such bang for the buck that I promised the owners I'd write a review to make up for their lackluster name.

Let me just start off with that this is a restaurant I frequent whenever I'm around Dundas Square or Dundas and university.  Yes the restaurant's decor doesn't strike class.  Yes the name sounds like they serve rabbit food.  Yes the restaurant is family run and by Indians.  But this restaurant is like EPIC (Fairmont Royal York Hotel's restaurant) constantly on winterlicious - and yes this means they serve meat, all kinds in fact.  Menu is flat at $25, which includes appetizers, a main course, and dessert.

Of the many times I go, I often stick with the garnished and delicious fried calamari as appetizer, which amidst the splash of colours presentation has a light but delicious accompanying sauce.  Presentation is definitely top notch here - the vibrant decorations but no cheaping out on the quantity.

For the main course I've had the lamb, chicken, salmon and pork chops - none of which has been disappointing.  I would even go so far to describe the entrees gourmet.  The lamb, especially, on one occasion was so succulent and tender that just pressing against it with the knife had juices coming out.  Needless to say the flavour was spot on, and without any game-y smell.  Each main dish is generally compensated with diverse food groups so ma can't scold you on skimping veggies.  In almost all visits, I hardly have any stomach for dessert after the first two meals.

But you can always eat dessert, especially if the menu has Lindt chocolate ice-cream, Mango Coconut Panna Cotta and others.  In fact, even the dessert is garnished!  The Lindt chocolate ice cream comes with fruits and a cone wedge, and distinctly screams class with its rich Lindt flavour.  The Mango Panna Cotta feels home made and fresh and is vibrantly decorated to eye candy the stomach candy.

Service is standard, the family tries their best to make customers happy (perhaps despite their cultural barriers).  But what gets to me every time .. is how did I just eat a gourmet full course meal like that, and leave full, for a mere $25?"}
{"text":"Tried something new last night (by eating healthy!!! lol.) When I first told my fiancé about it, he was reluctant to go. He kept asking if he was going to be served tofu XD But after seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp, I'm confident that even if we had to eat tofu, it is still going to be amazing balls.

Restaurant is run by Chef Dan and his hardworking crew. It is a small place on the block, SE of University/Dundas. Don't be fooled by the unattractive name or décor of restaurant, this place is definitely a hidden gem for good eats in downtown Toronto!

Food is fresh and delicious, presentation is impressive and they give you a huge portion too! 3 course prix available daily for lunch ($20), and for dinner ($25)... not just during Summerlicious! Unfortunately, no liquor licence. So, we just drank water (healthier choice, ya? lol). Nevertheless, still worth checking out :D

 All the items we ordered really stood out:
- Spicy lamb rolls - Must order! Filling was really flavourful, and had a super crunchy exterior.
- Butter chicken drumsticks in martini glass - Very nice presentation, meat falls off the bones!
- Build your own Salmon flay burger - Great flavours altogether, salmon was juicy and cooked perfectly :)
- Cracked spices chicken supreme - Mountain full of veggies, chicken was tender and well -seasoned
- Creme caramel ice cream - Smoky and sweet goodness paired with fresh berries, I want more!
- Alfonso mango panna cotta - Very smooth and creamy, and the white chocolate chips were a nice touch!

I will definitely revisit this place again without a doubt!
Happy healthy eating :D"}
{"text":"$25 for dinner. Don't be fooled by the the front face of the restaurant. The food looks amazing and you can definitely tell that it's made of high quality with fresh ingredients. Unfortunately they lacked consistency with their portions (especially since they have a fixed menu) and flavour for all dishes. It was just too salty and I wish the veggies were cooked more. I honestly felt that the plating of the dishes deceived my taste buds.They also do give out plastic water bottles instead of glasses. 

Great service! They were very curious about how you found out about the restaurant and really emphasized how fresh the food was. It was also good to know that the food does take a while to make."}
{"text":"Positive experience over here! Staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I had the calamari, the seafood special and the Panna cotta.

The calamari was delicious and fresh a good ratio between batter to calamari. A couple of nights ago i came from eating calamari from another place and had more batter than meat. The dip (which came in a shot glass) was also tasty, light, and refreshing. 

The Seafood special was a big bowl of soup with Seafood ingredients. The closest comparison could be the bouillabaise. It was delicious! Had 2 crabs in it, 5 big shrimp,  3 or 4 mussels, 8 or 9 clams, 2 small fishes (could be sardines?). There was a lot in the bowl, you definitely get a mouthful.

The Panna cotta was tasty.  It was light and cold giving that refreshing sense. 

The Seafood special took some time to make and being seated right in front of the chef I got to see the prep work and other items. Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu and definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have created a food Meetup group in Toronto, with the emphasis being on dining in restaurants that offer tasty and affordable food.  Little did I know that most of the restaurants that serve affordable and delicious food in Toronto, do not take reservations. Bummer! Boy do I have my work cut out for me.

I spend a great deal of time reading through reviews and browsing menus, and one evening I was growing weary and I was just going to give up for the evening when I stumbled upon Be Fresh, Eat Healthy. I know, I thought it was an odd name too. According to the majority of the reviews, this place was deemed to be a \"hole in the wall\" but with beautifully presented and delicious tasting food. If that wasn't enticing enough, the portions were described as huge and great value at $25 for 3 courses (they don't have an a la carte menu)! I immediately contacted the restaurant and made reservations for 12 people.

When we arrived at the restaurant, our table was ready for us in the back. By the time everyone had arrived, we already knew what we wanted to order. In fact, I always know what I want to order because I have a habit of reviewing the menus of restaurants I plan to visit repeatedly until I am certain of what I am going to order. I know you are thinking, \"get a life!\" :) What can I say? I love food!

Below are some pictures of the food we ordered. And let me tell you, the food was spectacular! So much so that I returned with another group of people 2 weeks later! Chef Dan has this amazing ability to mix savory and sweet. The combination of fruits, meat and vegetables somehow worked. I would normally coward away from eating both vegetables and fruits together, but Chef Dan managed to convert me. It was also my first time eating quail. How he managed to get the quail to remain juicy and tender is beyond me. Quail is one of those tricky birds to cook because of its small size.

All my guests enjoyed their meal. And believe me, that is a hard feat to accomplish. In total I brought 24 people to this restaurant in a span of 3 weeks, and every person gave it 5/5. I just fear that they are going to realize how much of a deal their menu is that they will bump up the price. But that said, I would not blame them. How many fixed menus offer quail and shrimp as an appetizer option? And we cannot forget the portion sizes. Just the pork chop alone had people in awe. I highly recommend that you pay them a visit. ASAP! Oh, and say hi to Chef Dan and his wife! They are truly 2 lovely people running a hidden treasure in Toronto.

FYI:
*Do not email or use their \"contact us\" option on their website. They do not check email.
*They don't have a liquor license."}
{"text":"You know when they say don't judge a book by its covers? This place embodies that statement and all I got to say is give this place a try. You can't go wrong with 3 course 25$ GARNISHED, TASTY meals. They used to also have really delicious GOURMET sandwiches for under 10 dollars at lunch. Get past the weird decor, the lame name, the unprofessional service (they do try their best though, points for effort, I think it's a cultural thing), and you will have one of the best bang for your buck meals in the Dundas/University area.

Constructive advice to management: redesign/redecorate the restaurant for more refined intimate atmosphere, tone down on portion size and showy presentation, learn dining service professionalism, plating could be better."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Each plate decorated as a state of the art!"}
{"text":"I was conflicted about doing this review. If this place gets too many good reviews, I would have to make reservations to go. Right now it seems mostly Ryerson students who have discovered it. If you are near the Eaton Centre or City Hall check it out. The food is delicious, and the cost is minimal. Good thing since I did not know it didn't take credit cards."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! Hidden gem tucked away on Dundas Street. Thought they were a salad/vegetarian place when I first heard of them. Not the case (although they do have vegetarian options).

This restaurant nails the art of food presentation. Each plate from my three-course meal looked (and tasted) incredible. The price is a steal for the quality of  ingredients and taste of the food ($25 for the entire meal). The menu changes from time to time and they try to post an up to date version on Facebook."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. Anyone would never notice and would always walk by without even seeing it because all the attention are taken away by Sansoutei two doors down. I decided to try this place out based on the raving reviews here.  I must say that I am very thankful that I finally gave this place a try. 

I ordered their prix fixe dinner and got the blue crab Caesar salad and their lamb for main course and it was absolutely amazing. The salad wasn't overdressed and the flavor of the blue crab went really well with the lettuce and their dressing. The lamb was so tender it just fell off the bone! It also had no odor. 

I wish I'd discover this place sooner because I would come here at least once a week! The price is absolutely ridiculously cheap for the quality of food and amount you receive! Don't let the exterior of this place cloud your judgement! !"}
{"text":"This appears to be a family-run restaurant run by a very talented chef.  Don't be fooled by appearances.  Although this restaurant does not feel trendy or even welcoming (decor-wise), the food and service more than makes up for it.  

My colleague and I went there for lunch today.  The air conditioning did not appear to be working so it was hot inside this already warm summer day (the open kitchen doesn't help).  Nevertheless, we decided to eat in.  We ordered the daily box lunch (to stay) which consists of a daily sandwich special (today it was a choice of pulled pork or crispy warm veal & cheese - we chose the veal), homemade cookie, fresh fruit and a bottle of water.  

The waitress also brought us some homemade foccacia and homemade hummus on the house as we sat down.  Both were superb!   

Portion sizes are very generous.  The veal sandwich is huge and full of fresh ingredients (sauteed mushroom, roasted pepper, caramelized onion, marinara sauce and fontana cheese).  I asked for hot sauce since I like everything spicy and it really kicked up the taste of an already great sandwich!  I am looking forward to having the second half for lunch tomorrow since there was no way I could finish the entire thing.  

Today's fruit of the day was an orange and the homemade cookie was a delicious and soft oatmeal, fruit and nut cookie.  Loved it!  

I really want this restaurant to succeed.  Chef Dan came around to ask if everything was to our liking which was very sweet.  I feel good giving him my money, not only because the food is fresh and delicious and the portions are more than generous but because Chef Dan clearly has a passion for food and he highlights locally grown products.  If only restaurant makeover would come in and pretty up the place!

Despite the decor (or lack thereof), I will be back."}
{"text":"Eat (lots of) fresh (delicious food); be healthy.

It is a 3 course meal at a set $25 per seat. Their menu changes every quarter or so, so make sure to check their menu on their facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/eatfreshbehealthy/?fref=ts. Our table chose a number of different combinations in order to try the different items; dishes that stood out were the crispy calamari, the maple mustard glazed double cut pork chop, and the panna cotta. 

Each dish delivers on my trifecta of food: aesthetics, flavour and aroma, and portions. Each item tasted great and was presented in a lovely manner. The only negative (if you can call it that) is that portions are so large that you might grow tired of the flavour.

The restaurant is very unassuming and from its modest interior, you would begin to make assumptions about the place that couldn't be further from the truth. Take a chance and try the restaurant - I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Simply excellent. It's an open concept kitchen so you see them cook everything to order.  

Me and my friends had the spicy chicken lollipops and quail for our appetizers. The chicken had a good amount of spice and the cool fresh tomatoes complimented it very well. The quail was also quite nice.

For our entrees, we had the pork chop, spicy shrimp & calamari pasta, and salmon burger. The shrimp & calamari pasta wasn't quite as spicy as the chicken lollipops but it was still delicious. Though two minor complaints is that I wish the shrimps were removed from its shell and that there was just a bit more corn. The pork chop was nice and it was also HUGE. It came with A LOT of vegetables too. I didn't taste the salmon burger but my friend gobbled it up quite fast so it must have been delicious.

For desserts, we had the mango panna cotta and strawberry sorbet. Both were a refreshing finish to a hearty meal.

Overall, portions were very generous for a $25 three course meal, everything was beautiful (except the decor and washroom) and delicious, and service was top-notch. Will definitely visit again in the future when there is a new menu and will definitely recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"Great food, and great service! We went for their WInterlicious menu, and everything was wonderful - beautiful presentation that delivered on taste. They told us that they always have a prix-fixe menu, which is a fun, fresh concept that I love. The menu is always changing, so I look forward to going back and seeing what else they can do."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the most memorable places I've been to in a long time. They've invested zero dollars in the decor and are somehow pulling off a mandatory pre-fixe menu for lunch dinner. 

Their success is due to the fact they've realized there's enough people out there looking for great combinations of lean protein and fruits and vegetables. They nailed it.

If I'm in the neighborhood, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5/5 stars because it's really a unique restaurant, and the food is delicious and an amazing value. 

However, it's also kind of weird. The decor is very plain, and the dishes are pretty over the top in their presentation, with piles of vegetables and swirls of sauce over everything. It's kind of like you're eating at a culinary school restaurant led by over-enthusiastic and slightly amateurish chefs. 

But in the end, the food is good and a great value for the price. 

The Spicy Chicken drumsticks were crispy and spicy and really excellent. The Lamb was a really delicious and rich cut of lamb in a thick gravy with mushrooms. The calamari was also fantastic. The salmon was a bit plain in comparison, but still good. The mango panna cotta was lovely. Portions were all huge and really fantastic for $25. 

I would definitely eat here again, especially if I wanted to take some hungry, adventurous friends out for a meal that was interesting."}
{"text":"Created a Yelp account just to make sure I could review this restaurant and its phenomenal staff. This isn't anything you haven't read on other people's review, but just want to reiterate how fantastic the meal and service was at Eat Fresh Be Healthy. 

Every meal was extremely unique, the prix fixe options were all great (+vegetarian friendly), and the staff was super attentive. Honestly, I don't know if there is any place that is a better value for your dollar than this restaurant. Just make sure you call ahead of time and make a reservation with the staff because the space is small, which also lends itself to a very intimate dinner, if that's what you're looking for. Would highly recommend this place to everyone.

Cheers,
Sahand"}
{"text":"Staff is excellent. Set menu, very fair priced and everything tastes incredible. I would highly suggest this place to anybody."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little restaurant and I am lucky to work just a minute away!! 
First of all, i never even noticed this place until a few coworkers were ravign about it. It sounds like something more resembling a pita joint in a mall food court to be honest... so yeah...the name kinda decieves you. 

I called these guys up after readign the glowing yelp reviews and made a rezzo for 2 at lunchtime. Thank goodness for a reservation because when we arrived the joint was packed and people had to be turned away. We were promtply seated and brought out the summerlicious menu promotion. (usually lunch is 20.00 for the prix fixe but as per summerlicious - the menu was 15.00 - BOOM!) 

I ordered the watermelon and berry soup which was like a delicious refreashing sweet gazpacho. It was clearly made fresh and tasted amazing!! Next up was the butterchicken dish - the chicken was moist, personally, i could have used a bit more of the butterchicken sauce, but aside from that - the protion was generous (4 drumpsticks, rice, vegetables) and everythign was plated professionally and with care. The last dish and my absolute favorite (i could have licked that plate clean!) was the alfonso mango panna cotta. I lOVE mango. This dish was just heaven....i ate is soooo slowly so to savour every mrosel that hit my tongue. The pannacotta was creamy and melt in your mouth and had piece of little whiel chocolate chips in it....The panna cotta was sorrounded by like an egg custard that i could have lapped up after... and i wanted to....

Service was friendly, welcoming, quick and efficient. You can see the 3 chefs behidn the counter cooking up and plating these dishes they obviously take great pride in. The waitress/hostess was wuick to refill water and ensure that our food was up to par. 

We felt like we had gotten a steal for lunch for 2 of this caliber - so we left a 10.00 tip on a 34.00 bill for 2 .... definately returning for another lunch here in the very near future!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out this restaurant because of the amazing reviews but I was quite disappointed. The restaurant itself is small and has an open kitchen, kind of like Subways, which was interesting because you can see your food being prepared. The tables have paper menus laid out, which are flipped around after you order to become a place mat, and a bottle of water per seat. My friend and I came here for a Winterlicious dinner. Here's what we got:

Eat Fresh Caesar Salad garnished with Crispy Blue Crab - Garnished is right, the crab had almost no meat in it and was just for presentation. The salad was an average caesar without much cheese and was served in a mug... which still had the price sticker at the bottom (?!?)

Crispy Calamari served with Scallion Yogurt - Probably our favourite dish from the menu. The calamari was perfectly crispy and seasoned, it didn't need the scallion yogurt. In fact the pairing of the two was odd to me, I would have preferred a sweet and spicy sauce.

Ontario Braised Leg of Lamb and Mushroom served with roasted Garlic Mash and Vegetables - I've never had lamb before (I know, don't judge me!) so I was excited to finally try it out. I was expecting an actual leg of lamb but was given two fatty pieces with covered with sauce, with a side of runny mash and lightly steamed veggies. The flavour of the lamb reminded me of my mom's Vietnamese Ragu, which is sort of like a stew. 

Maple Mustard Glazed Double Cut Pork Chop served with Mashed Potato and Vegetables - The pork chop was a bit dry and hard. They were also served with a side of runny mash and lightly steamed veggies. 

Lindt Chocolate Ice-Cream - I loved the ice cream, it really does taste like Lindor chocolates. It came with a goose berry, wafer, blueberries and a strawberry. The strawberry was still frozen when I received it so that was a slight turn off to me. No, it wasn't just cold from the ice cream, it was frozen, I couldn't even use my spoon to cut it into chunks, it would just slip off and thunk onto the plate.

Espresso Panna Cotta - My friend really enjoyed the espresso panna cotta, which swims in a sweet custard flavoured sauce with floating pomegranate seeds. 

3/6 dishes were like but I don't think I will be back anytime soon for just dessert and appetizers."}
{"text":"I can't stop coming to eat here. It's an affordable night out with some one best food presentations. Every dish is delicious. The place is family run and it's very apparent through the friendly staff and pride in making great tasting food."}
{"text":"This place is such a good value!! For $25, you get a full 3-course meal with very large portions. It's like Summer/Winterlicious every day!

I ordered the crispy calamari to start, maple mustard glazed pork chop, and then the ice cream. I also tried a bit of the chicken lollipops, beef liver, and mango panna cotta.

I enjoyed every single one of my dishes! The calamari was great, flavourful but not too salty. The pork chop I got was HUGE and I was very pleased that it was not too dry, since that is a frequent issue I find with pork chops. It also came with some vegetables and mashed potatoes on the side, and was presented nicely. My ice cream was alright, but the mango panna cotta was delicious, so I would recommend getting that instead. Of the other things I tried, I did quite like the beef liver, which was very soft and juicy. The chicken lollipops, which are meant to be spicy, were okay but a little too spicy for me.

For some reason they put \"reserved\" signs on a lot of the tables and apparently they prefer for you to make a reservation beforehand. However, we managed to get a seat right away even though we didn't have a reservation. The service was very good, and our waitress was especially friendly towards my dining buddy because she remembered him from the week before :P But overall I would say the atmosphere at the restaurant was pleasant and lively, but not too loud. This would be a good place for dinner with friends or a date :)"}
{"text":"I came here two days ago with my boyfriend and we loved this place! My actual star rating will be 4.5 stars out of 5. 

So we checked the review of this place to see what's good so we were both aware of what's good and bad about the place.
We both got 3 course meal for $28 (yes price went up from $25 to $28), which is a decent deal for a 3 course meal.

 According to the yelp reviews, we were both aware their presentation of the food is visually appealing and also the use of dishes in this restaurant. 
My boyfriend got the popular demand on the menu: calamari and I got the arugula with pomegranate and berries salad for our appetizers. My salad was great, it was very colorful with fruits and the arugula looked fresh and the salad overall was not-so watery (that's a good thing). My boyfriend's calamari was visually appealing, nicely spiced but the use of shot glass for yogurt sauce was a little off, since it was pretty difficult to dip the calamari into the sauce without breaking the calamari.

We both got maple glazed pork chops with steamed vegetables with mashed potatoes for our Entree. Again, the presentation was visually appealing where the vegetables were arranged beautifully. This is my opinion, but making the pork chop stand on the plate is not really necessary just because we are laying it flat anyway to eat it. 
The plate was not really concerning in this dish (just a normal dish we use at home). We both loved the taste of the food, I personally like crispy on the outside and soft and smooth on the inside so I can say I loved the way the chef cooked the pork, it was perfect!

Dessert was perfect too with the Lindt Chocolate Icecream with fruits on top and Mango Panna Cotta ( we got one of each). They were both good, but for the Mango Panna Cotta's plate, again the plate made it hard to scoop them. If it was in a bowl-like plate, then it would be a little bit better. 


Overall, the quality of the food is perfect, but the use of the dishes could need some improvement (use a bowl instead of a plate or a shot glass)."}
{"text":"From the outside, it doesnt look like anything special but a friend recommended this place for lunch so a bunch of us thought we would give it a try. We were SO pleased with the food. One of the girls at the table with us commented that the waitress reminded her of her mother..lol. But seriously, she seemed to take a genuine interest in making sure we would like our selections.  

I ordered a veal sandwich and got the side of salad. Very reasonably priced and super delicious. The chef has obviously thoroughly thought about the flavour combinations. I can't speak for dinner time since the menu is totally different but I've also heard good things. 

I would recommend this place for a quick place to get yummy and healthy food to go. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the inside of the restaurant looked pretty bad. Not a great place to take a date. But overall give these guys a try and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant located near St. Patrick Subway station. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. I got there about 30 minutes before my friend and they seated me and served me water (my preferred drink) until my friend arrived. Their $15 lunch specials are excellent. The food is fresh, not frozen or prepared a day or so ahead of time. The portions are reasonable and a good value for the money. The service is prompt, polite, and efficient. The menus accurately describe the meals and the servers are ready with explanations concerning the spiciness of the food. The lunch special includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Mercifully, the dessert is not heavy or large. For $15, on weekday, in the core, this restaurant is hard to beat. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this restaurant, but it has been a mixed bag of good and bad.

ATMOSPHERE:
Open kitchens are great, and this was no exception. It was nice to see the cooks prepare the meals and the fresh ingredients on display.
When I walked in the restaurant I immediately noticed the overwhelming smell of bleach which was a bit off putting, but nice to know the place is clean.
The lighting was cold, lit with bluish LED lighting which had no warmth and made the food and people look a bit sickly. This combined with a lack of any music created an eerie awkward ambiance.

SERVICE:
The service was excellent, very friendly and courteous. They had really odd hours as they close at 9pm, even on a Friday. I arrived at 8:30 not knowing about this and stayed until 10pm but we never felt rushed and they didn't even mention that they were closing while we had our dinner. They were really patient with us and we even had a nice conversation with the staff while they were discretely trying to close up. 

FOOD:
It was great that they only offered a prix fixe menu with a decent selection of dishes. At $25 it was an excellent deal for three courses.
While the ingredients were fresh I didn't think it was that healthy. There were a lot of fried foods on the menu which were a tad on the oily side, and the dishes were over salted and my taste run on the salty side.
It was hard to categorize what kind of cuisine they were serving. It was a mix of Italian, Caribbean, Mediterranean and few other cultures. The people running the restaurant were Indian but oddly I didn't see much Indian influences (I hope that doesn't sound racist).
 
The calamari appetizer tasted great and not overcooked but the presentation was overdone, served in a sundae glass which a shot glass of dipping sauce was in the middle but didn't know was there until I ate much of the calamari -- luckily there were splatters of sauce on the plate to dip it with before I discovered the shot glass.
The chicken lollipops were really good, with a nice amount of heat and jerk-like flavours.
They were out of the seafood stew so we had the lamb shank which is a decent rich osso buco-like dish with a big piece of lamb which was very tender and flaked off the bone, but again heavily salted, and also had the salmon which was nicely cooked and juicy.

The mango coconut pannacotta was nice and refreshing and not too sweet. The chocolate gelato was homemade and also good and not too sweet and had a nice mix of fresh fruits and coconut. 

The portions were very generous, but I wished they could have reduced the portion sizes and  created cleaner more refined flavours with less salt and toned down on the showy presentation which bordered on almost ridiculous and clichéd. Almost every plate was garnished the same way from appetizer to dessert with a mixture of fruits and veggies which made eating each dish a bit tiresome and less interesting.

The place is not licensed to serve alcohol, which made for a cheap dinner but I would have been nice to have a wine or beer with my meal, but they did offer complementary bottled water which seemed unusual as they were individually sized and drinking out of a plastic bottle at a restaurant seemed really weird."}
{"text":"Eat Fresh Be Healthy prides itself of creating seasonal, sustainable, local and organic food. Although dishes are well composed, the service is sub-par. 

I had visited Eat Fresh Be Healthy on three occasions. The first visit was a year ago for Winterlicious. The food was fresh, delicious and portions were reasonable for the price. My companions raved about the pork chop. One claimed it was the best pork chop he has ever had. The second occasion was to see a friend during lunch. Again, the food did not disappoint. The salmon was small, none the less, it was still satisfying. 

On the third occasion, my colleagues and I visited Eat Fresh Be Healthy for a going away lunch. Originally, I tried to book lunch at 12:00 PM. The owner expressed that they are very busy on Friday and would prefer the large group to arrive at 11:45 am. I concurred and promptly notified the team of the change. The day of the lunch, the owner called ahead of time to confirm the number for reservations. I told her around 8-9. People's schedules seem to be changing. She pressed for an answer. While, I can appreciate the owner's predicament, I cannot confirm what I do not know. She remained somewhat insistence. 

The moment we sat down, the owner asked if we are ready to order. We politely declined, as we did not get a chance to even review the menu. After we placed our order, my manager arrived. The moment he sat down, the owner asked what he would like. Again, he did not get a chance to review the menu. The owner mentioned something about food takes long to prepare. Unsurprisingly, the owner gave us the bill before we finished our meal. She did not even asked if anyone would like dessert. When the bill arrive, we were given incorrect receipts three times, from $9.99 to $30. 

The service is a complete disappointment. The owner kept thinking about turning tables around and did not fully acknowledge the customers. The restaurant was not at capacity when we finished our meal. There is a table dedicated to scatter menus. My colleague echo this sentiment. At the end of lunch, he was doubtful about the integrity and honesty of the owner. My other colleague expressed her hunger after the meal. 

I once had high regards for Eat Fresh Be Healthy, however, after this unpleasant experience, I can no longer recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried this place for summerlicious. Decor is very simple, looks like an old Subway converted into a restaurant. Food is unbelievable. I had the shrimp tempura that came in shot glasses with exotic pineapple salsa. My husband had the quail, so tasty and perfectly cooked.
Owners are really friendly, although service is a bit slow.
Try the Lindt ice cream for dessert, its heavenly."}
{"text":"Small intimate restaurant - $20 prix fixe lunch and $25 for dinner (3 course meal). Very good deal in my opinion. 

Hidden gem in the dundas area. I had the quail for the appetizer, pork chip for entree and a mango panna cotta for dessert. Presentation was good and all food is made from scratch. 

Quail was with blueberries and salad in a martini glass. Tasty but difficult to eat. 

Pork chop was huge and tasty - it had a good amount of meat with a bit of fatty parts for good taste. Veggies on the side was a nice touch. 

Dessert was good - petite and sweet. 

Make a reservation before going, it's a small place."}
{"text":"Good date place for U of T students, I presume ...

$25 prix fixe for 3-course meal that is more than decently sized and includes quality items such as lamb ribs and salmon and seafood pasta!

As for food quality, it's better than the price point suggests. Is it the best meal you've ever had? No. But between a couple of friends in a small cozy place run by a nice Indian family, it'll make a nice evening. 

They put effort into the food and don't skimp on ingredients, so I'm all for supporting this small place!"}
{"text":"Great quality and price! As others have mentioned, they serve a 3 course meal priced at 20 for lunch and 25 for dinner.

For appetizers we ordered the chicken lollipops and tomato bisque. The chicken was very juicy and had a nice crisp to it. The peach coleslaw that it came with was also delicious. They used fresh nectarines and tomatoes. The soup was just as good. It was very rich and flavorful - definitely the best tomato soup that I've ever had so far.

For entrees my bf ordered the spicy shrimp and calamari pasta and I went with the vegetarian special, which was a three mushroom pasta with cream sauce. Portions were huge and I loved how much vegetables they include! I'm a pretty health eater loved that aspect in all of their dishes. 

For dessert we got the pistachios ice cream and mango pana cotte. The mango was delicious! They top it off with freshly shaved white chocolate. I was in a happy place.

Overall great service and food. Since their menu changes I'd definitely come back if I'm ever in Toronto again."}
{"text":"When I walked out of this restaurant, I really couldn't believe that I paid only $25 for my meal. The restaurant itself was small and had limited seats, so that was the only drawback. The food was presented well, tasted fresh and was served at the perfect temperature. I could go on describing my specific meal, but I won't, because I'm confident that everything on the menu is delicious. If you've ever watched  the movie  or read the  book \"100 foot journey,\" it almost feels as if the chef was the main character from that movie. I highly recommend this place! Ten stars for Chef Dan!"}
{"text":"Don't trust the review from other viewers. It is simply overrated.  It is Indian fusion restaurant but categorized as \"Italian\".. the seating were so uncomfortable and the kitchen was right beside our table because it was tiny. Other than looking sketchy from the red colored wall, the smoke and noise from the open kitchen were so annoying and you could see the ingredients all over there and it totally turned me off before ordering.   It may be good for some Ryerson students who want to have 3 courses meal but do not want to pay more to go to a decent restaurant.  Do not go there if you want a cozy comfortable place to eat and talk."}
{"text":"Sooooo
Im a bit confused. I went here for dinner with a friend for the winterlicious event. I picked this place because of the great reviews. Though at this point there were only 13 reviews.
It does look like a little cafe more than a restaurant but that is besides the point. I was here for the food.
On here, it describes the restaurant as \"italian\", but none of the staff or chefs were Italian. Ok fine, no problem. But the thing is, the food didnt seem Italian either. It was like some kind of fusion food and the flavors didnt seem to fuse well together.
I had the baby arugula salad with fruit - that I must say was good and refreshing. (one star) My friend had the tempura shrimp. She found it a bit bland and it had a lot of batter on it. 
Now on to the mains: 
My salmon was grilled with a fruit salsa with ... mint. The salmon was overcooked and dry.  I felt the flavors did not go well together. I did take a pic since the presentation was nice but deleted it after tasting it. I dont know exactly how to describe it but the smokey taste of the grilled salmon and the random fruit with Mint threw me off. Its as if they focused on presentation than flavor. 
My friend ordered the shrimp pasta. It seemed like it was stir fry shrimp with minimal pasta but a stew-like sauce, the shrimp were swimming in it. She didnt seem pleased at all but managed to finish as best she could. I tried a bit and it tasted somewhat Italian - like a pesto kind of sauce. But the fact it looked like stirfry threw me off again.
Dessert: I had the panacotta - I did not finish it . My friend had the Lindt icecream and she said it was good.
The wait staff were pleasant and courteous. Though it was only one lady for the whole \"cafe\" so some of the chefs had to help out with the serving and taking the bill.

Yes - we were left confused - about the previous reviews, about the type of resto, about the flavors. But the staff seemed to be nice people. I feel bad writing a bad review since the staff were nice - but lets face it - its a resto - it needs good food. I would not go back, nor would I recommend it to anyone. 

On and btw - it was FReezing sitting by the window. There is a heater on the ceilng in the middle of the cafe. Sit there if you dare to go."}
{"text":"not italian at all. bad indian food
didn't refill the water
found an onion in the desert"}
{"text":"It was a good restaurant but not as good as a 4+ star one!
the design of the food was nice but the taste was nothing special! besides, they refused to provide vinegar, olive oil, mustard, salt or pepper! they said the food and salad is what it is and nothing should be added to it."}
{"text":"Great place that provides great value! I love prix fixe menus. 

Cons:
*decor is very, very humble
*smells strongly of bleach upon entrance, if you're one of the first people to eat there for the night - but cleanliness is a good thing!
*the menu doesn't seem to have changed much in a while, and some change would be nice since the menu is small

Pros:
*great value - $25 for 3 courses, year-round
*the calamari was beautifully prepared
*crispy chicken drumsticks were delicious, though a bit too spicy for my friend
*the porkchops we ordered were enormous - like, an inch thick - but cooked to perfection (aka wasn't charred on the outside but perfectly cooked on the inside and, miraculously, unbelievable succulent and juicy)
*chocolate ice cream was delicious and not cloyingly sweet
*generous portions
*beautiful presentation of the food
*open kitchens are always nice 
*service was friendly and courteous, even though our server was very shy

Overall, I had a lovely experience here and would be happy to come back!

Bonus: They let diners know that they cater - part of the placemat shows their catering prices. Very reasonable from the looks of it, and the food quality is very good!"}
{"text":"This place surprised me as I stumbled by it as I was walking along Dundas. Really good service and the food was so good! I would highly recommend this place! The appetizer was squash soup, the entree was lamb with roasted veggies and the dessert was a mango panna cotta. Even though I had it for take out, there was so much care with my take out packaging."}
{"text":"This is the proverbial hole in the wall great value restaurant every tourist looks for in a big expensive food oriented city. Not only was it a great value but the food and the hospitality from Chef Dan and his wife were bigger than the City itself. The idea is to order the $25 three course meal and have an appetizer, main course and dessert for one price fits all. We took advantage of that offer and started with a wonderful creamy pumpkin soup sprinkled with pumpkin seeds and cinnamon. The soup was very tasty and not too thick but could have been a little hotter. I had the roasted/grilled spiced chicken with the sides (wonderful vegetables consisting of organic carrot, bok choy, asparagus, golden beets and mashed potatoes.  My husband had the veal scaloppini with the same veggies except he had a lone red beet on his plate. The food and the presentation were exceptional. It felt like we had a meal prepared by our own private chef. Chef Dan served the food extremely hot from the oven while his wife made sure we had drinks and whatever we needed to enjoy our meal. it was a great experience for a good price.

The final touch was dessert. We each had one of the two desserts offered. The ice cream was a Lindt chocolate flavor with fresh berries decorating the plate. I had a small flan with fresh fruit floating in a watery green sauce. The flan did not have much taste so I only tasted it and ate the fresh fruit.

We also ordered their version of iced tea which consisted of yogurt and mango mixed with turbinado sugar. It was a bit sweet and thick and not quite what I expected with this elegant made to order meal.

Yes I would return - it was one of the three Toronto restaurants we dined in and while all of our meals were great -this one was not only great-it was a fun dining experience in a very ordinary setting.

Note: You must have a reservation for dinner as the dining area is very small. Chef Dan can only cook for so many at dinner and he turned away 8 customers while we were there. Hopefully they will return and be able to enjoy this glorious food."}
{"text":"$25 prix fix menu had good variety and the presentation for everything was superb. The food here definitely outshines the decor and portion sizes were massive. Everything is market fresh and cooked to order. Will definitely return for their rotating menu."}
