{"text":"Ive been going here for a while (regularly), but lately I haven't seen the owner and it seems like theyve endlessly been rotating deadbeat employees through there. They're screwing up a ton of orders, and they oftentimes dont know the specials or how to run the register....not to mention theyre unprofessional. This place is going downhill QUICK and it's a shame."}
{"text":"This place is closed!!!!  Tried calling and no answer so I drove up and they are closed."}
{"text":"Seriously?   In this day and time of health consciousness........ok...it was a free choice to walk in but, seriously?

Ok... two people for lunch....one bison burger and one hot dog plus two drinks, one water and one fountain soda,  cost $23.79   Seriously?

The mini-mound of fries was about 2 potatoes of fries...covered in cheese, and very tired looking bacon bits and smothered atop with Mac n Cheeese...Ok, so I didn't read the menu...i just thought it was going to be fries.  Fries with mac n cheese and more cheese....OMG  ....I know I'm going to need a laxative.  omg.  They were cold fries on top of the heart attack I was about to down.  Seriously?

The dining room was a huge red room..  I felt like i was eating in the waiting room of mechanics garage.  Given the amount of oil expended to make my lunch it could have been.  Red walls, loud untuned radio station, heart attack food and 30$ for all that pleasure.  Seriously?????

Go next door to Greek or Thai.  Skip this accident."}
{"text":"Decent burgers for sure about the same quality as Five Guys but since I prefer the Five Guys fries to the BnD fries I would have to say Five Guys is a little better"}

{"text":"I'm from the Central PA area and I visit Bethel Park every few months or so and I always make it a point to stop here.  A huge list of options to add to my burger or hot dog, the burgers have a great fresh taste, are always cooked to order, and are seasoned exceptionally well.  My go to is a quarter pound burger with a fried egg and grilled onions, a fried egg is the greatest thing man has ever added to the burger.  If you go with friends make sure to order the Mound O friez, a huge helping of fries covered in cheese, fresh cut bacon, and Mac & Cheese!  This is a HUGE app, you'll need to share with 2 or 3 people at least.  BnDz is a must visit when in the Bethel Park area!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!! It's (almost) guilt-free \"fast food\" because of the quality of the ingredients they use.  We have sampled the beef and bison patties, as well as the bacon wrapped cheese dogs, and all are fantastic and as healthy as meat gets!  :-) The grass-fed beef burgers are my personal favorite, and I am equally fond of the regular fries and the sweet potato fries (don't forget that cinnamon sugar!)  We are also delighted with the new additions of milkshakes, root beer floats, and Boylan's sodas - fantastic to enjoy pop without the high fructose corn syrup when dining out! :-)  Some of the menu items are admittedly a little pricier than other places - but I feel I am paying for quality and unique options, so I am ok with that.  We have sometimes experienced  the service to be a little slow, but other times it was quite fast - given that everything is cooked fresh and to order.  Again - I don't mind waiting a bit for that. (Being able to walk into a place and leave with a burger and fries within a minute or two - well, the food \"quality\" is going to reflect that...)
[Hope it's ok to say this - and I'm not sure if it's ok to use their names - but some the \"popular\" restaurant discount companies offer deals for this restaurant - I highly recommend purchasing one of those in advance to keep your costs down...]"}
{"text":"Burgers and Dogs is a very good restaurant. You can fill out your order on a piece of paper (there are tons of different options). There isn't too long of a wait for your food to come to you. Their burgers are very, very good, and they're fries are pretty good. Go here if you wanna enjoy a good burger."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Mac and cheese burger is amazing and the fries are delicious (and huge ... We each got a small fry and it was too much, so next time we could probably share 2 orders and have plenty. Great spot, reasonably priced and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Hats off to BnD'z owner Doug for a terrific concept and execution to match. Three months after opening, the place was jumping on a frigid Friday evening, 3/4 full with steady takeout traffic. Furnishings are spartan, but nobody's there for atmosphere: it's the food and the value that pack `em in.

Still, $10 for a burger, almost in Finleyville? You bet, and well worth it, when it's a half-pound bison burger served fast & cooked exactly as ordered, on a sturdy multigrain bun with a choice of literally dozens of toppings, served with a bottomless fountain drink.  I went with grilled onions, Dusseldorf mustard and chipotle aioli -- less is more on the extra-lean bison burger, Doug advised (and he was right). A basket of hand-cut fries were $2 extra, and on par with Kennywood's Potato Patch (if not *quite* Dirty-O-level sublime). Chased with an Arnold Palmer, it was the best $12 meal I've had in a long, long time -- and that's at the higher end of BnD'z price range.

But burgers are only half the story, as the name implies.  There's a big Vienna Beef banner out front, and genuine Chicago-style dogs await within, right down to the poppyseed rolls, sport peppers and celery salt. It's been years since I've had one of these beauties (at a hole-in-the-wall under the El), and I can't wait to go back to see if the BnD'z version is as good as the original.

Nobody and nothing is perfect, though, and here are two minor critiques.  First, the service model is a sort of fast-food/table-service hybrid, and it takes a few minutes to figure it out.  No big deal though, since you'll need at least that long to decide what looks best on the menu. Also, I mentioned at the outset that we visited on a frigid night, and we were reminded of this every few minutes by a blast of cold air as customers came and went through the single door (no airlock/vestibule).

But that's just nitpicking.  Burgerz and Dogz offers a level of quality, value and adventurousness (ostrich and rattlesnake may be on the menu this summer) that might be common in Shadyside and Regent Square, but is practically unheard of in the far-flung south hills.  Best part for East End foodies: it's a short (brisk) walk from the end-of-the-line Library T stop, so you can buy a transfer and make a cheap excursion out of it, rolling through the backyards of Castle Shannon and Bethel Park.  Bonus: it's BYOB, too!  Just try to avoid those sub-zero wind-chill factors."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the potential to be a great addition to the Uptown business district. Great location. Clean, modern interior. Plenty of seating. I've been there at least a half-dozen times since they opened. But I think they're still trying to find their way. My last visit was so awkward, a little embarrassing even, that I stopped going. If I ever return it will greatly depend on the circumstances. 

The main issues with BnD'z? The ordering system and the staff. 

Not only was it time-consuming and confusing to place an order, most of the staff - some of whom lack the personality it takes to deal with the public - seemed a bit confused as well, unable to handle the basic task of taking an order for two simple hot dogs with a few toppings and some fries. 

I get the hip concept of filling out an order form for maximum customization and [hopefully] accuracy. It's a great idea on paper [pun intended] because there are nearly 60 options between the cheeses, seasoning, sauces, toppings and buns. Regrettably, their order form doesn't live up to its potential, at least for me, and that's the last thing I want to happen in a burger & dog joint. Sometimes I just want to walk into a place like Shorty's in Washington, PA. In and out in under 2 minutes while the place is slamming. Talk about efficiency! 

I was not impressed with the burgers. I thought the beef was on the dry side - and bland, if not a bit overdone, and therefore - way overpriced for what you get. An expensive burger should live up to the price. I make grass-fed burgers at home that are better anyway, so my last visits to BnD'z were limited to hot dogs because I don't keep them on hand at home. These were pretty good, you might even say - amazing, almost worth the effort it takes to order one. I saw where the owners were indeed going to make changes to the ordering process but so far I haven't been inclined to go find out for myself if they did or not."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying this aint' no Burgatory!  Yet the prices are as if you we're getting the same quality, service and atmosphere.  There is no waitstaff (except to deliver the food to your table) and when she did, she brought the fries out ten minutes before the burgers, that were just so/so. Finally, after spending more money than this food is worth,  you have to clear your own table.  We definatly will NOT be back."}
{"text":"The food is OK. Toppings options are good. They have twice refused to price my meal correctly because I have a Groupon. They blame the owner/management when I ask. The prices are a little high and the Groupon would have made it acceptable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a burger with the kids. My daughter loves the Mac and cheese. I love the buffalo burger and the sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Good selection on burgers and hot dogs like bison burgers and casing or without casing wieners. And if you're in the mood for a fish sandwich Friday then you're in luck."}
{"text":"Great burgers as well as everything else on their menu! The Mac and cheese is to die for and the staff is very friendly! The owner of the business is also very friendly and takes great pride in his business :) great place for lunch and dinner!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"It was excellent.  My only, and I mean only, nitpick was the my medium bison burger was delivered well.  It was still great!"}
{"text":"Gross.  Overpriced greasy burger and fries I threw away.  And I was starving!  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonably priced with great service.
The restaurant is very clean. My wife even likes the burgers and she does not like animal products."}
{"text":"This place is great. Simple food prepared exceptionally well. Fresh ingredients, hormone-free, grass fed beef makes for awesome burgers. Fresh cut fries. Plus BYOB! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place recently came to Mt. Leb and it immediately hopped on my \"Eat Here\" list. I went with my guy after a heavy night of adult beverages and we needed greasy food ASAP. 
Foremost, the set-up of the restaurant is awful. We walked in to the store to the grill line and some bar stool seating (no alcohol involved). We tried to order there, but were sent back to the \"dining area.\" 
Our waitress was young and very slow. She didn't make much of an effort to connect with us or help us order, even though we told her it was our first time there. We ordered chili cheese fries from the menu as an appetizer - of course, they came with our main course. 
Tim and I both ordered custom burgers from the Burgatory-esque menu pads. The toppings that were available were extensive specialty items - avocado, smokehouse onion cheddar cheese, season your own burger? Why don't you have seasoned meat, BnDz? Our MTO burgers were tasty, but nothing special...even with the added specialty toppings. They were both over-cooked.
The dining clientele itself was very interesting. One woman knocked over her glass of Pepsi and her waitress took a total of 20 minutes to clean it up (with paper towels, no rag or mop). 

Nothing made sense about this place."}
{"text":"Get the Bison Burger!  Great food, good location, cooked well, this is one of the best places to eat in South Park (Library) love eating here.  Now they have another location in Mt. Lebanon right on the main drag in town.

BnD'z Burgerz & Dogz isnt the cheapest place, its not Burger King cheap but the quality, taste of food and service is again, outstanding.

Eat here, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was a disaster. We ordered to go and waited for a long time. The employees were visibly frustrated and stressed and it wasn't even busy. The cooks were all over the place and honestly I don't even trust my food to be correct. I hope it's as good as it smells bc this place is a disaster if it gets busy."}
{"text":"This location has CLOSED. Redeem your groupons at the south park location which definitely will earn your 5 star review. The original, and the best."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Best make your own burgers I have ever had. Fries are good, hot dogs are awesome. Service is typically good, awesome when Doug is there.  The one time he wasn't there it was awkward and kind of uncomfortable. The girl at the register just stood there staring at everyone the whole time we ate. I'm sure you could find something to do while you have no customers. And the 2 cooks were talking about someone or something. Kept staring at a family then turning around laughing. They also screwed someone's order up. Just wasn't the same vibe without Doug. Still my go to burger place 40 minutes away. You will love the food."}
{"text":"I was there last weekend with my family.  I was very uninpressed with the service and the fact that they could not get our orders right.  Also while I put our order in I watched the cook working the fry station over salt a small bowl of fries repeatedly.. I thought to myself,  I hope we do not get those fries.. the burgers were cooked to temp and we're pretty good.  The fries were as expected, unedible..  I'm not sure that there was a manager on duty and you could diffiantly tell. If your going to sell burgers for 10 dollars and up you better have your stuff together.. I will say we did have a much better experience at the library location.  But the owner was there.."}
{"text":"Love the burgers and the hot dogs. They have gluten free options which keeps me coming back. The staff and owners are always friendly. I recommend this place a million times over. Best food!"}
{"text":"great food! gluten free available, their burgers are ground fresh, use premium cuts from grass fed and antibiotic free beef. EVERYTHING is fresh and high quality, the owner is there everyday and very passionate about his business. the chili on the chili dogs is good enough to order separately  order their fresh cut french fries. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in at BnD's for the first time this evening.  While the décor in the dining room is uninspired, the food is good and reasonably priced. I especially liked the many varied selections on the create your own burger.  The service was quick and the staff was helpful and friendly.  Unless you have to have alcohol with your meal, B&D is up there with favorites BRGR and Burgatory (without the deafening noise levels I have experienced at Burgatory). Looking forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is. I ordered a bbq bacon cheesburger. It was decent. The roll was soft and doughy, not a good softly crusted bun. Fries are extra and at this price they should come with it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and it's just OK. I do not like the ordering process on the sheets. I'd rather just tell the guy at the register what I  want, but they have made it a chore to order. They burger was decent, but not the best I've had. In fact, the burgers across the street at the Saloon are much better, and cheaper. My husband isn't impressed either and probably won't go back considering there are other options. I had high hopes for this place but so far it's been a bit of a disappointment..Some of the staff are  friendly enough, but seemed confused as well. Not a good flow and overpriced."}
{"text":"Always underwhelmed by the latest gourmet burger chains, and tired of spending a cow-load of cash at them, I was delighted to find this gem, and it's only a few minutes from my house (although I'd gladly drive an hour to get there). Owned by someone who clearly cares about the place (table touches every time we're there), this place offers the best burgers I've tasted anywhere in years. 

They've got an awesome menu of suggested burgers, but I prefer building my own. Their signature mayo is key. My husband goes for the bison burger, but I'm a cowgirl all the way. Topping off the meal are french fries with cheese that rival a certain Pittsburgh-area amusement park's. They're opening more locations soon, and apparently one with specialty milkshakes! I hope to see a lot more of BnD'z soon."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I have two major complaints:

1. Why do the French fries taste so awful?  They are hands down the worst French fries that I have ever eaten.  How often is the fryer oil changed?  Is the oil strained every morning before the fryer is turned on?

2. Some of the food safety and hygiene practices of the staff are alarming to put it mildly.  I've witnessed a staff member drop tongs on the floor and then place them back on the counter to be used again.  The manager looked at us and then quietly walked over to take the tongs into the kitchen.  I've also seen employees wearing gloves touch their face and cell phone without replacing the gloves. 

I've worked in restaurants myself and these practices are disgusting and may put the health of customers at risk.  If you drop utensils on the floor you CANNOT pick them up unless you wash you heads before cooking again!"}
{"text":"We got a Groupon hoping to go to the one in Mt. Lebanon however when we got there last Friday night it was closed for good.  Luckily I remembered they had another location and off we went to South Park.  The location was not great and the restaurant wasn't the cleanliest.  The staff was very friendly and our order came out quickly. We had a hard time spending the $20 Groupon which is a good thing as the prices were reasonable. I went with the Chicago dog and my date ordered the bacon wrapped and cheese stuffed dog. They were both good but no D's hotdogs & 6 packs. We also got a side of fries and a large dinner salad. The salad was tasty and had a nice amount of tomatoes, cucumber, onion and croutons.  The fries were very greasy and not all the way cooked.  Unfortunately, I probably will not go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Big Daddy Bison burger and it did NOT disappoint. Oh man, was it good. And the mound o' fries were shared amongst four of us and, although super fattening, a little bit of heaven won't kill you. I don't think I can put into words how delicious this place is. I highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Loved it! Best garden burger I ever had! Met the owner and franchise owner. Very friendly! All free range meats and hormone free! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have tried the Mt. Lebo location. The first time was shortly after they opened and clearly had some kinks to work out. After going for a second try, I am still extremely disappointed in them. 
Granted I did go for lunch at noon, on a work day, when the local schools had a half day of school.
They were clearly understaffed and unorganized. It took over 20 minutes to make a standard salad with no meat on it.  The girl working the register/taking orders also had to take food to the people who were dinning in. The cooks seemed very scattered and kept repeating orders."}
{"text":"BnD'z is great!  It is nice to have a little place to go grab a burger that isn't like Fridays or Max & Ermas.  Ordering is done on slips of paper, so you can customize your burger or dog however you'd like.  It is a challenge though because there seem to be infinite combinations of meats and toppings.  I tried the bison burger and it was amazing.  The fries were also great.

Overall, the service is fast, there are infinite options, the quality is incredible and the atmosphere is very relaxed and casual.  Also, the owner is regularly on site and attentive, checking with customers to make sure they are pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"I had the mac and cheese burger and I thought it was excellent! Cooked just as I ordered. The fries were very good also. There is quite a variety on the menu and I look forward to returning ( deep fried hot dog---c'mon)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Just tried it tonight on our way home from skiing. I had a Chicago Dog which was 100pct authentic! Neon green relish and sport peppers! The fries are amazing and they have malt vinegar on the tables which pairs beautifully! The cole slaw was very good and I saw but didn't try the chicken quesadilla which was literally grilled! 
Will definitely frequent seeing as it's on the way back from many places we visit outside the s hills!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided on trying out Burgerz And Dogz in South Park after finding it on Yelp one day.

Well, I want to go back for sure. My daughter was not crazy about the hot dogs, but she is sometimes picky. 

My wife and I loved our burgers and I am looking forward to going back to try a bison burger."}
{"text":"After living no more than 10 mins from this place my wife and I finally remembered it was there and tried it and WOW ......I am not a big Mac and Cheese guy but when I tried the wifes ....yummy ...creamy and tasty I picked at her's and should have just gotten my own ....She has the small burger with tons of fixins and the extras were just as filling as the burger ....I myself had a regular old cheeseburger that was pretty tasy also had a basket of regular fries and a basket of Chili cheese fries ......I was filled beyond capacity and WILL be going back as soon as I can afford it ......it is that good and Id rather support the local guy that Rotten Ronnie Or the King"}
{"text":"Best hot dog EVER! Bright, friendly staff and excellent food so far. More on the menu to try so will keep coming back. Delectable fries!"}
{"text":"Burgers 3.5, dogs 4.0, fresh cut fries 5.0. Nice stop when your in the mood for burger and fries! Lots of fresh toppings to choose from, love the poppyseed hot dog buns. Fries are yummy!"}
{"text":"I was met as I entered the restaurant by a very friendly employee.  He proceeded to ask if I'd been here before, and then explained how it all worked.  This was very welcome and avoided the whole awkward moment of wandering around, wondering if you seat yourself, wait to be seated, or whatever. My husband and I then sat down and ordered our burgers and fries. All of the staff were great.  The food was wonderful.  The toppings were very fresh and plentiful.  We will definitely visit here again and tell our friends about it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints.  You can create your own burger with options for buns, cheese, toppings and sauces.  They have an excellent bison burger.  The three cheese hot dog is amazing! And don't forget the fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"I visited BnD'z as part of my search for a good fast casual burger place that is within a reasonable distance of my house. I like Five Guys but it is a little too far to be convenient from where I live in the South Hills. I had put off going to BnD'z because despite its decent overall score the Yelp algorithm seems to frontload the bad reviews and those were scaring me away. I wish I had visited sooner.

The burgers are delicious, with awesome flame grilled flavor, and perfectly toasted brioche buns. The fresh cut fries are also great. They have a lot of toppings and options, though in both of my visits I got pretty standard burgers, cooked to medium with cheddar, the house mayo, lettuce, and ketchup. The service has been very good as well. Both times we visited it was pretty busy but the staff did their best to keep up while being friendly and helpful. 

I did have a couple small gripes which should be mentioned. The first is that the buns are just a little too large for the burgers, if they sliced off about 20% around the edges it would be perfect. The second is that on our first visit our fries were delivered to us overcooked, dry, and crunchy. We asked if we could get another batch and they quickly cooked us up another. On our second trip the fries were perfect the first time. 

Apart from these small issues the burgers are delicious, the staff is good, and the prices aren't bad for what you are getting. I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Excellent customer service, fast, clean, and the food is definitely made of quality ingredients! Delicious!  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Got a $20 groupon because I wanted to give this place a try. The location is close and wanted to love it - staff was very friendly and the place was not busy because it was a late lunch.  We ordered 2 burgers and made them a meal (added a drink and fries) and the total was over $30 so the groupon for the meal for 2 didn't even cover 2 burgers with drinks and fries! In my opinion it felt like a fast food place at gourmet prices. If I'm going to pay that much I'd rather go up the street to BRGR in the galleria. The burgers were juicy but BRGR is better so won't go here again."}
{"text":"10/08/16 visit I order the Chicago Dog, Mac and cheese dog and chili cheese fries.

Both the Chicago Dog and Mac and cheese dog was excellent. The mac & cheese dog would have been better if it was more the homestyle thick type instead of the amish style that is runny.  But was good.

I love that they have fresh cut fries. However I did not like there version of the chili and cheese fries. The cheese was the nacho cheese type and really doesnt belong on a hotdog . The spicy of the nacho dog over power the chili and I did not like it.. I put vineage on he bare fries and like it very much. But most of the fires went to waste. I would order this again. But I will just order a plain fresh cut fries.

I would come again to this place I just wouldnt get the cheese on my fries or the hot dog (assuming it is the same cheese.

Tip to the owener.Get some good liquid cheddar cheese. to put on your fires and hot dog"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh. It's reasonably priced and I always leave more than full. It's a nice casual atmosphere and the staff is always  friendly and helpful. I highly recommend stopping if you get the chance."}
{"text":"Love the layout & concept of this restaurant! Employees were so friendly & helpful--we were first timers. So awesome you can personalize your meal to how you want it. Which is what I did. The Chicken Burger on Whole Grain Roll & my preferred fixings was amazing. Hubby loved his Loaded Burger & my tween loved the Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog from the Favorites menu. My youngest had a burger from the Kid's meal, which she liked, & was a good portion. They all loved the fries. My only issue was the Cole Slaw--it was good but there was way too much Black Pepper. Way too spicy. Tone that down a bit & I'll happily give 5 stars. Great place, we'll be back many times, & refer to friends."}
{"text":"Very good service burger cooked and seasoned exactly as ordered kind of cafeteria style but very well done will go back"}
{"text":"It was completely empty when we arrived, fine it was 2pm, not lunch not dinner. We came into the host/waitress playing video games on her cell phone. We had to wait a little for her to finish her game. Not sure who the heck is in charge of this place, but IT IS NOT appropriate to be on your phone when customers are present. The workers all openly bickered in front of each other.

It was also Friday when I went, our waitress charged me full price for the hotdog, correct me if I'm wrong-- isn't it $1 off on Friday? I was charged full price, I didn't question it because I was too annoyed to find out if there was fine print on it. But come on, you can't honor your specials?!? It was a buck, lost a customer over it. Also, whoever actually owns the place should ban the use of cell phones when a customer is there, it was absolutely inappropriate to have to wait for her to finish her game!!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier to see another Bndz location! It's great to not have to trek through South Park to get one of my favorite burgers and fries. Furthermore, this location seems to be more open and spacious.
 While out and about in Mt. lebo, I called in my order and took my food to go. I immediately began to compare the new Bndz to my beloved South Park location. Overall, the food was spot on. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and delicious. My only gripe would be that they seemed to skimp a little on the fries. When you add on the fry and drink combo it's another $3. The burgers are already about 10-12$ each so, a little pricey to start. Therefore, if I'm paying 15$ for a burger and fries, I do expect to have a good size helping of those delicious fried sticks. 
Fries aside, my favorite aspect of Bndz is the emphasis on quality, hormone free meat. The ingredients are always fresh and of a higher quality than most. Have you tried the chicken bacon burger? Yes, it is diced chicken but, it's much tastier than the typical, dried out chicken breast most places call a burger. Overall, I'm thrilled to welcome Bndz to the growing restaurant scene in Mt. Lebo."}
{"text":"Yum, yum yum! BnD'z is a cute little place in a small plaza in South Park. Not the easiest place to find. I met a friend at BnD'z for lunch on a recent Saturday late afternoon and her GPS took her to Brentwood. FYI this is not the most kid friendly place either. I wasn't able to find a high chair and the tables are close together. The idea is that you order at the counter (off the menu or build your own burger), get your drink at the fountain, find a table and wait for your meal to be brought out to you. The kitchen is mostly open. You can watch your meal being prepared behind the counter where you ordered and paid. There are a couple t.v.'s but you can't really hear much over the loud music. 

We both decided to order the chicken, bacon burger with cheese and a side of fries. We were given the choice of a plain, wheat or gluten free bun. Within about 5 minutes, our meal was delivered to our table. The chicken burger was exactly that. A burger or shredded, chopped chicken. Not a full chicken breast which is typical of other restaurants. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the chicken burger but it was actually very tasty. The fries were also cooked perfectly. Fresh cut, crispy, salty and soft in the middle. Overall, BnD'z is a great place to stop if you are in the area and in the mood for a great burger (beef, chicken or bison) and fries."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's like burgatory but smaller and more relaxed and casual. They have a menu of items you can order that they've created or you can go down their checklist and pick what you want. Something I love about this place is all of the different options! You can choose from regular beef, chicken, veggie, or bison. That's a really nice choice for those who may be vegetarian, those who don't eat red meat, etc. they also have different bun options, such as pretzel, multigrain, brioche, gluten free, and a lettuce wrap. Next you choose your cheese, a rub, and then your toppings. Majority of the toppings are free (up to 6) which is really nice. They do also have specialty toppings (avocado, bacon, etc) that cost a bit extra. You can Also add fries to your meal, including my favorite, sweet potato fries. Everyone there is always very polite and professional. Even when they are busy they deliver the food promptly. I love it here and will continue to come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint around. The bison is great and sweet potato fries are to die for. The service is always great. You know it's a good joint when the owner personally goes to every table and asks how the food is and if anyone needs anything. Can't wait for more locations!"}
{"text":"Good place for burgers. We came in on a Thursday evening. There were a few other people seated and another waiting for pickup. It is surprisingly large inside. We each ordered ¼ lb custom burgers and split chili cheese fries. We didn't mind waiting as each item was made to order. I had macaroni and cheese, onion rings, and buffalo sauce on the burger. It was cooked to my liking (medium) and was juicy. The bun seemed a bit big for the burger but that's not a bad thing. The chili did not taste homemade but more so out of a bag. Price wasn't terrible at $23 with small tip and large drink. They have daily specials as well."}
{"text":"Food and service was good but very expensive. I had a $2O groupon (for which I paid $12) and had to pay $14 more.  Plus $2 to park in the garage next door.  So while the novelty of custom burgers is cool, and they tasted great, it simply exceeds the price I am willing to pay for lunch.

I got the 8oz burger. Well, an 8oz is actually two 4oz patties stacked.  It was a bit awkward to eat.  Tasted good though.

The dining room was a dissapointment.  Here we are in a corner location on the main drag in Mt Lebo and we are sitting in a spartan room in the way back of the building with windows too high to see anything but sky. 

I rate this place a 4 because I got what I wanted but probably won't return due to the high prices.

I should note: the amount paid was for 3 people."}
{"text":"Favorite burger place....always fresh food, clean restaurant, and nice staff. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Our first time going even though I pass it everyday! We definitely have to add to our list of favorites! The MOUND OF FRIES was to die for! Fries, cheese, bacon, Mac n cheese piled high! It was amazing and my 3 Hungry girls loved it too! I had a Chicago dog and it was Really good to. Love the taste of the celery salt, but I tend to favor it on anything. Kids had Mac n cheese w a hot dog it was cut up in it. They loved it. Super cheesy! My husband had a bacon cheese stuffed deep fried hot dog and he loved it to. So go try the Mac n Cheese and Mound of fries!"}
{"text":"Very expensive.  The service was not good.  Food was mediocre at best, expected much better for the price.  We were very disappointed and will not be back.  It cost us a small fortune to take the family there. The kids didn't like the food, but that wasn't our big complaint."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time recently and when I saw the menu, I was slightly overwhelmed with all the unique choices. And then I saw papers on the tables labeled \"build your own burger\" and the game was changed. Chipotle aioli, deep fried bacon stuffed hot dog, BISON BURGER?! The possibilities are delicious (and also endless). I couldn't decide between the macaroni and cheese topped hot dog and the bison burger, so I got both! I ended up not creating my own and just went with the menu options, and they did not disappoint. The bison was cooked perfectly to my request (which was medium rare) and topped with a flavorful tomato salsa and savory steakhouse cheddar cheese. Everything is organically fed and grown and antibiotic free. Think of it as the Chipotle of burger joints. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I eat here often. I love it. Many say it is expensive but what isn't anymore? Perhaps a bit more than average but I believe it makes up for it. They have a nice variety of things to add. They make it any way you want. The bison burgers are great! Great staff too. Pretzel buns and gluten free buns are available for both burgers and dogs.

The only suggestion I have is a turkey burger would be a VERY welcome addition. But their chicken burger is pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been going here almost once a week since they opened and always get the same thing. The Chicago Dog with the natural casing is just about amazing. This hot dog could compete with any in the Windy City and that's probably the case because they use the same Vienna Hot Dogs. 

Another cool thing I discovered this past week is that they are doing 1/2 off mounds of fries every Wednesday, which is a heart attack of fries, nacho cheese, bacon, Mac n cheese and ranch. Throw in an Iron City and it's yinzer heaven."}
{"text":"Bagged sweet potato fries!!!! Terrible staff!!!! Mound of fries is heart attack on a plate. Mac n cheese is made with canned cheese and in the microwave."}
{"text":"Simple seating, friendly service and but inconsistent food (varies from great to over cooked and chunks of over salting). Blows the socks off Burger King type places, More like Burgatory. Good for a simple meal in the $11-15 range for a combo. Would not make a special trip to return."}
{"text":"Summary:  Awesome Hot Dog's and Burgers. We have visited this new restaurant a few times now and find the food and service to be consistently good. We plan to go back. I highly recommend it !

Location:

Nicely decorated and modern looking. Short and easy to navigate Menu. Their core focus is Burgers, Hot Dogs, Fries and Shakes. There are a few (well placed) large,  wall-mounted Flat Screens usually on ESPN. There is (limited) seating in the front for a quick in/out or waiting for your takeout. However there is seating in the back. I suggest you secure your  table before ordering if you have a larger group because space is limited. 

Positives:

Details of last visit: We brought some friends by for our second time and they loved it too. There are good food choices for Kids; our Daughter really liked the kid's grill cheese. Her friend gave a 2 thumbs up for the Kid's Burger and they both LOVED the fries - actually we all did :-) The adults tried the Sweet Potato and Regular Fries, Barbecue Burger, Hot Dogs and the Garden Veggie Burger. We all found the food to be Hot, Juicy and VERU Flavorful.  

Opportunities:

Hamburgers are Delicious but a  bit pricey; $1 or $2  higher than I would expect. Overall Meal Price-Point for the 3 of us was $33 for Hot Dog, Sweet Potato Fries and a Drink / Barbecue Burger With Fries no Drink / Kids Meal Hot Dog and Juice. Feels like it should have been closer to $25. We would visit more often if the prices were a bit lower. 

Need some level of Hostess service to help (at least) larger groups of 3 or more. For example: in our last visit, we had to arrange and clean our own tables to accommodate our group of 6."}
{"text":"Really good food. I love that you can build whatever burger or hot dog you want. The staff is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Pros:
various choices to put on burger/dog
large amount of fries
free refills on drink
BYOB

Cons:
burgers are just ok
too expensive"}
{"text":"Great gourmet burgers. They're not as good as burgatory but decent for sure. I'd recommend going her and trying the brand out."}
{"text":"Very friendly employees.  I had a cheeseburger w/ fried onions and pepper jack cheese.  I liked it, but nothing to write home about.  Restaurant is clean and lots of tables in the back.  Temp outside was around 30 and it is cold back there, as an FYI.  The only seating in front (where its warmer since the kitchen is open concept) is counter seats.  Next time I will explore the menu a bit more as I noticed a Mac n cheese burger on there, which sounds pretty fab!  Overall a decent experience, good food, nice location."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon to this establishment a little while back, so on a random Sunday the BF and I decided to give it a try. 
Overall, I have to say that i'm a fan of this place.  The burgers were delicous and cooked perfectly.  There were a few things that were a bit irritating, but it was new restaurant pains, that they're clearly trying to work through.  
Our Groupon was for two burgers and two fries. They have several burger combos on the menu, or you can build your own.  We both opted to build our own and we were not dissappointed.  The fries were massive.  Next time we will definitely be splitting one. 
The staff was friendly and attentive. The man behind the register, I'm guessing he's the owner, was great. Super helpful and made sure that every customer enjoyed themself.
The wait to actually get the food was a bit much, we waited 35 min to get the food. In their defense it was really busy, but still that's a long wait for a burger and fries. 
My only other complaint would be that I wish the space was bigger. You do feel packed in on top of ppl.
I will definitely be back here. Despite the wait for food I would recommend this little joint. Can't wait to try to dogz next time! :)"}
{"text":"Just ate at the new Washington location. Casino Royale with cheese burger. Comes with bacon, Chipotle Monterey cheese, garlic aioli on a regular bun, and onion rings. Gf had chili cheese dog grilled with garlic aioli. Everything was great, another new favorite burger and dog joint!!!!"}
{"text":"WHOA. This place really is as good as it gets! We've been looking for a place that has a good veggie burger and we found a place that has a GREAT veggie burger. Service was extremely friendly and fast. The food though, oh the food. Sweet potato fries were just right, macaroni and cheese was on point and they even have sweet tea. A few veggie options for the vegetarians out there so we'll totally be back."}
{"text":"Such a fun little place. Doug the owner was working and was really friendly. The 4oz burger was just the right size for me. I opted to build my own.  Their fries were outstanding. Homemade, like my mother used to make. I had done yard work all day and we brought our own beer. It was a good ending to a good day. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed!  I have eaten at Bz N Dz in the South Park area (right beside the trolley tracks) and it has always been good. This visit to the one in Mt Lebanon was disappointing. I ordered a Loaded Salad with Chicken and my husband ordered a Chicago Dog with Chili Cheese fries.  
My husband really liked his Chicago Dog but the chili on the fries tasted like It came straight from the can. Yuck!
When my salad came it looked good-Spring Mix greens, tomatoes and cucumbers. I was ready to dig in. I ate some of my salad and realized there was no chicken. I took the salad back up to the counter and told them they had forgotten the chicken. The server took my salad and said she would take care of it. Well, I waited and waited and waited. I watched while all of the customers get served their food and milkshakes. Finally my husband stopped the waitress and asked about my salad. I think it's safe to say that they had forgotten all about it. They finally brought me out a new salad and when I went to eat a piece of the chicken it was gross. It looked like they had taken bits of the dark meat of a chicken and pressed them together. It was gray, had a weird texture, and had no taste.   I ended up asking for a To Go box. I thought one of my boys would eat it. Nope. We ended up feeding the \"chicken\" to our dogs. 
I don't think we'll go back."}
{"text":"My friend just moved into a new house and I went to see it. Soon it was dinner time and lo and behold this place was a hop, skip, and a jump away. I had been there before but my friend had not. I showed her the ordering tablets and she pulled off a page to fill out what she wanted. With your burger or dog you can get a side and drink for $3.50 extra. We both ordered hamburgers and fries but our hamburger toppings were completely different.  I ordered Bleu Cheese dressing, Bleu Cheese crumbles, pickles, and lettuce. All on a pretzel bun. My friend picked honey mustard, mayo, American cheese, and mushrooms. All on a white bun. 
You have a choice of hamburger, bison, or chicken. We both chose regular hamburger. You can choose from 4 or 8 oz burger. We both ordered 4. 
Our burgers came to our table pretty quickly.   The burgers and fries were hot.  I felt like the pretzel bun overwhelmed my burger. I don't think I would order it again. The 4oz burger was small. I wish they offered a 6 oz burger. The burger was drowning in blue cheese dressing but had hardly any lettuce. I had asked for it to be cooked medium and it was. I ended up taking the top of the bun off an folding the bottom bun over the burger. That helped. 
The manager came by twice to see if we needed anything. I thought that was nice-especially since they were packed. I started to get very cold and couldn't figure out why . . . Until I went to the bathroom and saw that the back door was open. They were bringing in supplies. 
While the food was good I don't see myself rushing to go back."}
{"text":"let me start with the positives: 
the burgers are awesome and cooked fresh
the fries are like fair fries and really good.
they have gluten free bun as an option
 never had the dogz.
 the toppings are a great choice but dont waste your time with the seasonings bc you cant taste them (they have cajun seasoning etc to put on burger but never enough to make a difference in taste from what ive found in two times weve been there)

the cons:
even with only two tables filled on a sunday, two burgers with two fries took 30 minutes to get.
when we went in there with a full house it took 50 min to get our food.
the prices are kind of steep for a burger joint. 28 bucks for 2 burgers and two fries. 
we only go there if we have a groupon coupon 
people are nice but with these cons we will generally pick five guys burgers over these burgerz and dogz."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, people were great, food was great. We just went today to get a quesadilla and a burger and it was all different workers. The cashier was really not pleasant. My fiancé asked for a rare burger not only was it fully cooked but it was burnt!! I had a quesadilla which I always get they put RAW ONIONS ON IT! I mean what??? It was just so blah I was really disappointed. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was enticed to try the place with a $5 coupon on a $25 purchase, which was received in a discount mailer.

The burgers and \"mound o'fries\" were delicious, though there should be a cardiologist on duty with the rich macaroni and cheese-topped fries.  One knows that they are not going to receive healthy food here, however.

For those that are willing to spend $10 for a hamburger in a spartan, small, crowded restaurant where the only service is provided by the individual that brings the food to the table, and where the \"napkins\" are paper towels that are in dispensers on the tables, this is for you.

I asked the individual that took my order at the register for a glass of tap water, and she tossed me a cup.  I was able to determine that there is a water tap in the iced tea machine.

For me, there is more to an enjoyable restaurant experience than good food.  This is not the place for me.

For $10, I could have gone to marvelous All India of Oakland, had all of the delicious, well-prepared, and healthful food that I wanted, and been treated like a king by the owners: next time."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever ate! We had to throw out the food. The meat tasted horrible. My daughters kid burger was way undercooked. The fries tasted like old potatoes. I hope we don't get sick! Also, the floor was so greesy that my daughter fell. The girl taking our order didn't even ask if she was ok! The place is disgusting!!"}
{"text":"Way more bun than burger. Six bites in all after the first 2 bites of it and no meat, I was so irritated I had to count. If your going to serve a small burger on a huge Kaiser roll don't serve it open faced, I took one look at it and said \"what the he**\" Fries were good though."}
{"text":"Creative burgers and sides. Very good! The owner even cane out to see how everything was. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We both ordered 1/2# beef burgers and were quite surprised and disappointed  to find that you get two 1/4# burgers on one bun, what's with that? However the fries were very good, all and all we won't be returning to the Washington facility."}
{"text":"Yes, we hit the other BnDz location! The one closest to us!

Oh, you didn't think we'd let it slip by us, did you? No, no after this weekend we wouldn't. 

BnDz's red-and-black motif is still in effect here, although this is more the be-seated-and-be-waited-on experience. Unlike the South Park location, you can make your way through an undulating hallway to take a seat in the spacious dining room or grab a stool at the counter to watch all the sizzling, grill-side excitement for yourself as you indulge. 

For those not yet hip to what's goin' on, BnDz's borrows from Burgatory their novel check-off sheet ordering system, allowing for premium customization. 

Once again, something was accidentally omitted. My burger -- this time the all-natural, hormone-free ground beef -- didn't have the bacon I ordered, but once I called it to our server's attention, she nixed it from the tab. Everything else I ticked off the boxes, however, was included. 

I went with the squishy Cellone's white bun, their \"signature mayonnaise\" (I'm not sure what they put in it, but it's a step above Hellmann's for sure), avocado (forgotten at the South Park BnDz, ironically enough), grilled onions, honey mustard, sweet onion power, garlic powder, dill pickle chips, lettuce, tomato, and a marvelously melted American cheese. 

Still, I propose that some sort of scanner like those used to grade standardized tests could be applied here to \"read\" the menu sheets so as to offset human error.  It's either that or have tableside touch screens. 

Another minor gripe I have is that my medium-rare burger was almost medium. It was sort of hard to tell, but I kept feeling like there should have been more pink and moisture in that patty. Regardless, I savored my soft, meaty, crunchy, creamy, tangy, salty creation, no holds barred. 

Kay and I each ordered a combo that got us individual servings of their french fries, which honestly could have benefited from another plunge in hot fat and a bit of sea salt.  Passable, greasy steak fries they were even if the other location's Original Hot Dog Shop-quality was not achieved here. 

We also shared a customized hot dog with bacon, bbq sauce, pickle spear, and diced onion on a pretzel bun and were left feeling pretty satisfied with what we'd concocted, the chewy, doughy bun pretty much making the frank. 

This satellite has some bugs to shake out of its turbines, but with a nifty business model and above average food, I think BnDz will become a fixture throughout Pittsburgh much like My Big Fat Greek Gyro has."}
{"text":"\"It's not THAT far away, \" I told my harried Kay and we drove DEEP into the South Hills for the promise of good, gourmet burgers and macaroni and cheese french fries. 

\"DARREN! WE'RE A FEW MILES FROM CANONSBURG!\" she screamed as we passed such stalwarts of this suburb's dining scene as Dorido's, Gil's Cafe, and the South Hills Clubhouse. 

Dr. Auslander, our chiropractor, is to blame. The man (his folks own Weiner World!) has become a fan of my reviews after he found my write-up on his practice recently and mentioned to me that a new burger joint had opened in our sector of the metropolitan area. With burgers always on my brain, I convinced Kay to drive and drive and drive...

BnDz sits in a typical suburban shopping complex near a trolley stop. Its exterior recalls Chipotle while its interiors and overall business model falls somewhere between Burgatory, D's Six Pax and Dogs, and Five Guys. 

Table service only occurs after patrons place their orders up at the register. Standard builds like the Chicago Dog or the BBQ Bacon 'n Buffalo Burger are there for the indecisive, but for the mad scientists there are the \"Create Your Own Masterpiece\" menu sheets on which patrons can check off the boxes and turn them in to an employee. Once that's done, one can pour a soft drink from the self-serve soda fountain, find an open table, and wait to be served. 

The cooking action happens in front of the counter in full view, which is where I wish I could have sat. A metal grill steams and flames while fresh, red, red, kroovy ground meat slaps the hot steel. Oil bubbles and growls once freshly cut fries are dropped into it. Drama unfolds once large takeout requests are phoned in. 

I decided to make my own monster using paper and pen: 8 ounces of Bison (!) cooked medium-rare (there is no other degree to cook a burger) dusted with garlic and sweet onion powder (yes, they do rubs), American cheese, chipotle aioli, leaf lettuce, tomato, red onion, bacon, and avocado on a white bun. 

This brings me to one minor complaint.

My avocado was forgotten. 

The cashier/hostess will punch in your order as she looks at your specification sheet, which leaves a bit of room for human error. Might I suggest an automated scanner of some kind of like the machines that electronically grade standardized tests? That or the sheets could be have a carbon copy on the bottom so a hungry bugger like me can verify his order. 

Another thing to kvetch about: The (vinaigrette) cole slaw was a dud. I sampled Kay's and all I tasted was black pepper and dry cabbage.

All of that was dismissed, however, once our burgers, dogs, and fries came to us in red plastic baskets via the jolly, beaming owner who seemed to know that we had ordered well. 

That bison patty was literally bleeding, and when I sank my canines into the burger, all I saw was crimson, sweet crimson -- a literally sweet crimson. I thought to myself, \"God, how could such a massive, fierce beast taste so delicate and candy-like?\" the squishy roll and saccharine fixings making it akin to cake, the blanket of exquisitely melted canary-colored cheese nearly dripping like a yellow ganache. 

A frank was also customized with honey mustard, onions, and a pickle spear after requesting it be deep-fried, filled with cheddar (a semi-dangerous dog) and placed within a poppyseed bun, my culinary cunning proving brilliant upon first bite. 

The Mound 'O Friez were shared by Kay and I, and Jesus, would Guy Fieri go berserk over this creation.

Imagine if you will oh jaded eater some immaculately twice-cooked and properly seasoned \"O\"-worthy french fries topped with bacon bits, cheddar, AND good, simple, venerable, scratch-made Mac 'n Cheese. 

Imagine further. Imagine a real, al dente macaroni topped with a sharply flavorful bechamel sauce. If this was Cheez Whiz, I'll be stunned 'cause they did somethin' to it! The frites had that crisp-vs-fluffy quality we all want in our gold tater shards, the bacon adding fatty/briny goodness and chewy texture while the liquid cheddar rained orange, creamy luxury over the entire debauched party. 

BnDz also offers desserts, but Kay wanted to have some ice cream, and the nearest place was Bruster's, putting us onto Library Road for the journey home.

Epilogue: As Kay drove up Washington Road with some out-of-towner friends of ours to the Mount Lebanon Primanti Brothers this evening, she noticed a familiar sight.

\"Darren! Look!\" she called out.

There is now a BnDz  only minutes from us in Mount Lebanon. 

It did mention franchise opportunities on their website.

The lady was not pleased with me for causing Friday night's unnecessary mileage. I still say it was worth the excursion, though. Ha. 

P.S. My mother makes an amazing cole slaw when she feels like doing so. Doug Baros should get in touch with her. He and his crew won't be able to make enough of it."}
{"text":"Stopped by to Creat Your Own Masterpiece.  The place was crowded with the small dinning area in the back being full and only a couple seats at the counter.  B&Dz use hormone free beef in the burger.  Burger was perfectly cooked and very good.  Had the sweet potato friez.  The friez were overly coated with cinnamon....!"}
{"text":"BnD'z is another new addition to the upscale burgers in the area.  Very casual atmosphere. 
 
If you are looking for a mouthwatering burger or dog made with fresh all natural grass fed, hormone free, antibiotic free beef and bison this is the place.  BnD'z servers gluten-free buns, too.

We had to take our order to the counter and then the kitchen brought our finished meal to our table.

Was it good?  Delicious and juicy!

The manager or owner was walking around asking how we like our meal and stopping to explained that the beef is ground daily by a local butcher, has 4 differnt meats...sorry I forgot the 4 types but one is sirloin.

The french fries were crisp, hot and salted.  Very good, better than most.

Some of the other tables had the dogs.  The dogs looked dog gone good. 

The sign says BYOB and no fee. 
Dine in or take out.

The burgers come in a basket.  Mine was messy, with some of the peppers falling off.  There were not any forks or spoons at the counter, not sure if they do have them but they may be needed.  Had the 8 oz burger which is really 2, 4 oz burgers with one stacked on top of the other.  The 2 stacked burgers were hard to eat because they keep sliding around and it was a big bite.  But I managed."}
{"text":"My husband just called into SP location and ordered 3 things. 2 of the 3 were wrong. I'm not a big complainer and thought they would just give us a credit and be done. No. I had to talk to a teenage cashier who said there was nothing she could do for me. I asked for the manager and Jessie(who said he was the general manager of the store) said \"I have to take my cashiers word for it...that's what he ordered\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  When I said if that's all you have to say, he said \"I'm sorry but I have to believe my cashier\". Like I was asking for the keys to the store instead of what we paid for. Goodness. Never going back."}
{"text":"First timer trying the bison burger, and OMG I have never had a better burger in my life!  I still have dreams about it. I must go back and order it again!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good burgers. I came here with my mom last night and had the 1/4 lb. beef burger with chipotle aioli, pickles, onions, and the like. Definitely a good burger and worth the drive from Peters Twnsp.! They also carry Boylan Bottleworks sodas which I loooove. Grape soda....yum. 

My 3 stars come from the fact that I got a basket of onion rings for $4.55 and got 4 onion rings. That is waaaay too little food for that price in my opinion. I don't know anybody charging a $1 per onion with batter. My mom ordered a medium well bison burger and it was dripping blood. Ay yi yi!!! However, she has had these before and they have been really good. My my! I'm glad we had a \"local flavor\" coupon for the food. This place would probably be too pricey otherwise. 

Hook a sister up with some more onion rings!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day after doing some shopping in the area. The hubby was really in the mood for a good burger and this place came up in our yelp search. 

When we went in we were quickly greeted and told that we should order up front and our food would be brought to us. We went to the back to check out the dining room seating, but since no one else was in there we decided to sit at the counter overlooking the grill space. 

We quickly decided on our food and placed our orders. We each got a custom burger and we shared a mini-mound of fries. Now the burgers were good. Well prepared and at the right temperature, but in my opinion where completely outshined by the mini-mound. This was an impressive heap of french fries, that miraculously stayed crispy and fresh the whole time we were grazing on them(close to 45 minutes), topped with mac and cheese, cheese sauce, and bacon, and we were given ranch to dip them in. These were so good and ridiculously decadent and we did eat for quite a while and still had a bunch to take home with us. 

Also I have to comment on the great staff at this place. We had the best time just hanging around with them. Everyone was very friendly, and made this an even better experience! Even though this isn't local to us I am pretty sure we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Seemed pretty good. I got the bacon wrapped cheese dog since I had to eat in the car. It's no as awesome as Ted's Hot Dogs home in AZ, but it was pretty damn tasty. I wish the drink cups were larger."}
{"text":"Food still great, however service has declined.  What I loved about this location was the seating and service in the back room.  Well that is gone.  According to the staff they had to cut back due to lack of patrons, so three back room is self serve.
 Maybe it's the weather?
 They did forget the Mac& cheese on my son's burger.  He opted not to tell them, he was hungry.  When you order an appetizer, they usually come out before the meal, here it's part of the meal.  So watch out.

So overall food great, but service not as great. :("}
{"text":"My kids love the Mac and cheese.burger!  Can't wait until they open in mt Lebanon, 1.5 weeks.  The Mac and cheese is creamy and yummy, burgers cooked to order.  Very friendly and easy going.  Right by third blue line t stop.   Desert Nachos?  Why not :)"}
