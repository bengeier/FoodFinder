{"text":"I'm not sure what's with the negative reviews on this place. The food here is great, and it's pretty much the only non-Mexican food or fast food option within a 5 mile radius.

My favorite thing off the menu is obviously their chicken. Not too dry, just right. Although I'm no deep fry expert I think it tastes pretty darn good. Friendly staff, everything is made fresh, even the sandwiches are deli cut on site. 

There is a wait but that's because it's not a cheap fast food joint. Orders take 20 minutes or less normally and I usually order from multiple people. A big thank you for expanding the available food in the area.

PS the hot wings are HOT! (:"}
{"text":"Looking for some fried chicken this evening.  Found this new shop that wasn't even on the map (or Yelp for that matter).  Chicken is pretty good.  Fried okra and mashed potato sides were good as well.  Not too many options in this area, so they were popular and it took a little longer to get our food, but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Mr. Chicken has closed and been replaced (or re-opened) as a Louisiana Fried Chicken and Donuts.

The chicken was good, but a touch spicy for being the \"regular\" menu choice. I'm wondering just how spicy the \"spicy\" option would have been?

That may have stung the old o-ring the next morning if you know what I mean!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at this place and I'm having mix feeling about it. I like the fact that they let you order from home so you don't have to wait over there and they call you when it's ready. I ordered the honey BBQ wings and it came with fries. I should have checked the order there because when I got home it wasn't what I ordered and I did not want to drive back over there after a long day at work. Even though I got the wrong order, the wings were still good. The fries were crap but that was to be expected. This place is not consistent and always check your order. Would I recommend this place? IDK."}
{"text":"meh.
have you ever been to a popeye's on a \"good day?\" it's amazing.
Have you even been to a popeye's on an \"off day?\" it's okay
This place is like a popeyes on an off day

Chicken is gloppy with fat.
Biscuit is pretty good."}

Under Four Bucks\"

I sat in the parking lot, staring at that sign. As it turns out, I wasn't quite THAT hungry."}
{"text":"Locally owned small chain with good tasting fried chicken. Tastes less processed than KFC. Wide variety of sides and frequent specials. Service is good."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago I was skeptical on trying their fried chicken. When I tried it it was crispy outside juicy inside with the southern flair to it. Needless to say I cannot stop eating their chicken. They also have a special on donut holes $0.99 for a dozen and they just melt in your mouth! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"$25 worth of trash. Look at the picture. We waited in line for 30 minutes to get nasty hamburgers some lame chicken french fries that were soggy all in the container here's the real show"}
{"text":"Came here about a day ago. Service was ok. I mean if you want top notch service, please you already know based on the location. However, I did not come for the high class service, I came for the food! I felt like it was a little pricey, but I suppose reasonable. I ordered some chicken tenders, and let me say they were delicious!! The meet was tender white and just so flavorable. The fries on the hand were a little soggy. Nonetheless, I love the chicken here and will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"The worst chicken ever! They partially fry it and then keep it under a heat lamp until ordered. The result is grease soaked , soggy unedible garbage. The cooks/ servers also do not use gloves or hairnets. They just opened and have a D health inspection. 
They should have had an F because they are terrible. They do not season anything. Horrible."}
{"text":"This is not fast food, but the fried catfish is well worth the wait.

Always polite and never a bad entree... I would never do the drive-thru but again this is not fast food... It is cooked fresh if you come in."}
{"text":"After waiting in a drive thru line for 20 minutes for our food we get home (3 minute's away) to soggy over cooked chicken. 

The workers didn't know a whole lot of anything except how to charge my credit card. 

Horrible food don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten my food yet, but I wish I had read the reviews before getting in the drive thru.  5 minutes at the menu board before they acknowledged me, another 5 before anyone came to the drive thru window to take my money, then after I paid she tells me it'll be another 10 minutes.  
By the way- don't ask for onion rings in your combo instead of fries, you'll be rudely told there are no substitutions.   
If the food is better than the other reviews mentioned, I'll amend my review, but for now I sincerely regret this decision."}
{"text":"If they rendered the old grease from Mr. Chicken and used it to fuel an RTA bus, there'd be some grubber fat chick from Twinsburg Heights chewing on the tailpipe grunting and carrying on about how good it is. What could you do? She'd be right. It's that good.

Mr. Chicken is awesome and greasy and classy and old school and you can get fries there you can't even figure out how they got that way but they taste good. And the chicken? Fried. Awesome. You'd do well to gnaw on some of it in your car or sitting at the curb looking out at the traffic.

You can't even argue with Mr. Chicken. If you were Mrs. Chicken, even then you'd have to agree with him all the time. He's a little old and rundown but he knows his chicken and it tastes like it ought to taste from a place like this.

Awhile back, at the end of the night Mr. Chicken would bag up the extras and sell it to families that were down on their luck. People would sit in junker cars and then there was a sort of unwritten set of rules on how you scored the chicken they were going to throw away. Now they just throw it away. It's easier that way. 

They ought to make awesome greasy chicken salad with it. Maybe some grapes in there. And walnuts. Something for the suggestion box. Or fry up the skin as a tapas. I tell you, wasting that much food is a sin. The maggots are eating too well out here.

But that doesn't mean their chicken isn't good. It tastes good and you can order all kinds of dark meat or white meat and it all gets tossed into some wild pressure fryer which infuses each piece with enough hot oil to insure that it can't be dry and it will weep grease in your fridge which goes well with a late night beer or if you're daring a Pepto-tini which is equal parts cherry flavored pepto bismol and Grey Goose, shaken.

I can't say enough about Mr. Chicken."}
