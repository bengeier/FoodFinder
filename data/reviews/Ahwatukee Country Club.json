{"text":"I played this course on 8/7/2014.  One of the four courses that make up Foothills Golf Group.  This course struck me as a basic municipal set up.  There were definitely some nice holes and, while this fairways were sort of burnt brown, what do you expect from Arizona in August at 107 degrees?   My biggest negative were the houses that seem too tight to the course.  Older houses with postage stamp back yards that put many houses into play.    I do have to say, though, that the greens were BEAUTIFULLY MAINTAINED!"}
{"text":"I just spent the day at Ahwatukee cc started with an awesome breakfast burrito, Mr. Becher was able to get me out for 18 quickly, had a great experience and enjoyed the practice facility"}
{"text":"I golfed this course in November 2014. The fairways were pretty nice and it's always gorgeous over in ahwatukee.  The golf cart paths are not kept up real well and beverage service shutdown at 3:30 on a Sunday.  I thought the rates were very fair and I would go back and golf it again."}
{"text":"I searched YELP for reviews and found they were so-so, but some stated the course had lush fairways but the greens were fuzzy and slow. I gave this a 1 star review because it's the only way I could post a review. Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this place as possible. If you have respect for the game don't play here. The fairways were anything but. Sparse grass, mostly dirt. Putting surfaces were tufts of grass with dirt in between. Tee boxes were a combination of dirt and sand with sparse grass here and there.  My playing partner offered to refund to me the Greens fees if we would stop after nine holes, which we did. Neither of us could take the course any more. This is a golf course in name only.  I have never encountered a place to play that has ever been in this kind of disrepair."}
{"text":"Greens ok. But this place is just not worth the money.  Lots of mud and the fairways are in very very bad shape.  Portable sprinklers all over the place. Fairways littered with so many leaves that it makes it tough to fine your golf balls even if you're on the fairway."}
{"text":"Played the course January 21st, 2016 for $32.  Nice layout but pretty poor conditions. Fairways were thin and fairly torn up. Greens were cut inconsistently and were very grainy and slow.   Compounding the conditions was the pace of play. Literally no marshals/rangers to push people. Three groups on every hole except for the two holes there were 4 groups.   All in all, it wasn't a terrible price compared to most current Phoenix prices, but they really need to at least speed the pace of play."}
{"text":"Very run down. Can't imagine ever playing here again. The men's bathroom out near hole #4 or 5 was disgusting. Broken toilet, broken urinal, unsanitary. Cart paths are cracked, heaving, broken. Old, outdated and dirty clubhouse. But nice golf cart."}
{"text":"Today was a great day for some golf. I joined up with a couple of guys from out of town and had a great round. Ahwatukee country club is in good shape. Greens are a touch slow, but fairways are nice and lush, bunkers are nice and Sandy.  Ahwatukee course is a great deal. Lots of specials out there so look for bargains.  The club house is nicely attended but if you can, Stop at Macayos on the 10th hole. Great snacks.  Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"First time playing the course.  An old course like me, old.  The kind of course I learned to play on.  Small Greens that run back to front for drainage. Fairways were generous but soft.  Had some spottiness at the outer edges of the fairways but other than that they were in good shape and the ball sat up well.  Looked like the greens had just been aerated a few weeks earlier so the greens were very, very,  slow.  I played the middle tees, 6100 yards is about all I can handle anymore and had a good enjoyable round 39/38.  Most definitely will be back once the greens heal."}
{"text":"My husband brought my son and I here recently. He has played here a few times before. I was shocked by how extremely rude and unprofessional the lady was at the front desk. My 20 year old son was coming along to take pictures and didn't bring clubs. So we purchased a cart for him to follow behind us. The woman ran into the first hole to rudely reprimand my husband for him not having clubs. We were so shocked and imbarrised by her approach that we decided to leave. We will never visit here again. Her treatment was unnecessary and she needs to be trained on simple human kindness let alone professionalism."}
{"text":"4* Ahwatukee Country Club Public golf course 10 miles south of airport off the 10 Friendly staff Moderate skill level, four tees, flat Maintained nicely Beverage cart Have restaurant in club house Got coupon from teeoff.com"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we have played here and it's been great! The staff is super friendly and helpful. Angela and Daniel were terrific today. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The grounds have DEFINITELY been improved since last season. Always fun to go and hit a few balls in the sunshine. They have both a golf course and driving range so you can choose which you want to do on any given day. And for those of us that like to drink, they always have awesome bartender working.."}
{"text":"Got a course that barely meets Muni standards yet has a Napoleonic pro with private country club attitude.   Went there to hit range. Balls were so old they were cracked and smooth. They flew like a Phil Niekro knuckle ball (look it up). Could not really tell any thing especially off mats. To top things off the pro was making threats over loud speaker from pro shop.   I'd avoid this course and staff at all costs."}
{"text":"Ahwatukee Country Club has been a staple of Ahwatukee for many years and in that time it's had it's up and downs in terms of quality. I've plaid on this course my whole life and have great rounds and terrible rounds in terms of the quality of the course and the condition it's in. In most cases the most important thing when playing golf is the course condition. I recently plaid here just in November and the conditions were perfect. The grass was green, it wasn't soggy, and the whether was perfect. The staff at Ahwatukee Country Club has always been fantastic. The Pro's are always willing to give you advice, and the restaurant and bar staff are very friendly and give great service. The only thing that's ever bothered me about this course is the practice range. I understand the concept, but I don't care for it at all. They have you hit off of AstroTurf and rubber tees. I've never liked it and it can kind of throw your game off a bit. Other than that I really enjoy playing at this historical Ahwatukee course."}
{"text":"They don't take care of their course at all, their workers start late so at 10:30 they are still following you with a mower or turning on sprinklers. They over charge you for the condition of the course. The cart path on most holes have either completely eroded away or was just never built. No sand in the bunkers and the greens are filled with dead spots from not seeding correctly or fixing divots."}
{"text":"I have never been to the Ahwatukee Country Club before March 31, 2013, Easter Sunday.  I guess I set my expectations too high.  When we arrived, there where many empty tables (that should have been our first clue).  We were escorted to our table by the bar in the room furthest away from the buffet.  There were some dirt marks on the tableclothes but it looked like they were stained.  Maybe they should have reconsidered using those ones.  We sat for a few minutes before our server told us she would be right with us.  About 4 minutes or so later she came over to take our drinnk order.  There were 5 of us.  She got 4 drink orders and walked away.  We had to call her back when she said she hadn't realized she didn't get my order.  We also had to ask her if it was okay to go to the buffet.  I think she was the only server working as I did not see any one else in that capacity.  When we walked over to the buffet table, there were no plates.  SERIOUSLY, NO PLATES!  There were two gentlemen in front of us that told us the person carving went to go get plates.  He brought about 10 which was ok for that moment.  The first chafing dish contained the eggs and potatoes.  The eggs loooked like they were overcooked and sitting there for a while.  The \"fresh cut potatoes\" were actually the best tasting item they had available.  The next chafing dish had bacon and sausage.  I prefer my bacon well done and none of it looked like it was cook that way.  The sausage looked greasy.  Next was the petite assorted quiche.  There was no sign to tell me what kind of quiche were there and they looked like they bought them from a bulk store instead of being freshly made. Chicken Marsala was next.  There were a few pieces left.  I was putting a lot of hope in this dish as it is one of my favorites.  It was way too salty.  This leads me to think that it was pre-made as well as a good chef would taste the food that they make to insure proper seasoning.  Then we had a chafing dish with a spoonful of mashed potatoes and some asparagus spears.  I had to locate the carving person to let him know we needed more vegatables.  Thank goodness he asked what else was needed, oh wait, I think someone from the staff should have been checking to make sure there was enough food available for the restaurant guests. Now we come to the salad.  It was so picked over and visually unappealing, I decided to pass.  However, the rolls they had were very good.  Since the carver person was busy refilling the chafing dishes, we had to get the ham and beef ourselves.  Please see the picture that I have uploaded.  NO BEEF and a small chunk of ham and a big chunk of fat.   So we returned to our table and picked at our food.  Our drinks were served, however the server was unaware of how to make a Shirley Temple.  That would be okay, but just ask.  I would rather be asked then served the wrong drink.  We had to return the drinks and tell her how to make them.  So we finish our lackluster meal and go to the \"dessert station.\"  Please see the picture.  Picked over red velvet cake, some chocolate cake, some pastries, a tiny bit of cheesecake, bite size eclairs with melty chocolate and sticking together in the center of a plate surrounded by not very good cinnamon rolls.  The Pièce de résistance was the peach pie in the silver tin.  Okay, so I was looking for a less expensive meal for Easter dinner for five people.  It ended up costing $160 and I was not only upset about what we paid but I was embarassed that I made the suggestion to go there.  This may be an okay place for a drink and a sandwich after a round of golf but they do not know how to do brunch.  I don't htink I would even consider them for any function after our experience there."}
{"text":"Great course for the money! Its location is primo and I love that for a short drive you can feel like you are on vacation. I adore the views of the mountains in the distance and I like that this course is manageable. I prefer the front nine to the back, which is good since I'm usually only up for nine holes... Then its time to hit the bar!"}
{"text":"I just went to Ahwatukee Golf Club for the first time yesterday for golfing.  Good:  People are friendly and helpful.  I like the course design and water features.  Pace of play was good as well.  Bad:  Greens were a little rough.   Overall AGC is a very good value.  Reasonable rates and good golf."}
{"text":"This is somewhat of a longer course par 72 I think but it's not that great. There is not one, NOT ONE ball cleaner on the entire course,guess you should bring your own?(don't use the pond tho)~All the grass was deAd but it was 112 degrees. When we teed off on 14 I could smell what I thought was dead animals covered in shit. From further inspection of the pond right by 14 there was about 10 dead birds covered in shit on the side of that pond. I have a good nose...The best view was a backyard that had a naked girl sun bathing, we were extra creepy about it and hit a ball in her backyard to get a better view of her knockers. Other then that u are just kinda playing golf in people's backyards the whole time. I wouldn't  go back even if it was free."}
{"text":"Lived here in Phx for 16 years, have never played this course and never will again. This course will probably shut down like Vistal. It has a nice layout and is challenging especially from the back tee's, however it needs alot of TLC.  Most tee boxes are not bad, fairways on the other hand are spotty at best, cart paths are in horrible shape .  Even when you drive up to the clubhouse you will recognize it has not had a coat of paint in 15 years.  All in all just a very run down facility. If they are making money they sure are not putting it back into the course.  Will not be back when there are other fine courses thruout the Valley."}
{"text":"Course was in decent shape.  My biggest issue was the course allowed two groups of 5 out before 8:30 AM!!!  The groups of 5 were back to back and were so slow.  It ended up taking me about 5 1/2 hours to play and I was so annoyed.  They should warn you that they allowed groups of 5 out!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has great food and fun events! Fish fry on Friday nights is delicious and all you can eat!  We also like going in for the Sunday breakfast buffet, no long wait like other restaurants around town!"}
{"text":"Its this one Sunday where i over slept and wake up feeling i have lost the whole day.... Had a quick bite and drove around and stumble upon Ahwatukee CC. As i remember one of my colleague told me a must play course. So without checking the web, i went in pay for twilight and start my round. Overall is a public/municipal course and its old and abused without much care. Flat and pretty much surrounded my houses. If i had to force it i would say its the longer PAR 3 where there is water hazard on the left that i could remember (maybe). That day the pin was tug left and i usually draw my shot so its a little intimidating to attack, plus the sun setting in the horizon is right in the middle of my face when teeing off. Very cheap but i won't go back unless i am given a free round with my buddy while i don't have other priority."}
{"text":"They would not honor the coupon that were given to them. They would not give the rate of buy one get one free from the entertainment book. A refund was asked for at this point and Nick refused and would not call for a manager. He sat there arguing with a smug look on his face and we just wait until he did something. He didn't do anything until others came in and saw we were upset about how they are handling things. He finally called a Pro from a sister course who was explains basically a bait and switch type of promotion. I again stated we wanted a refund and the Pro said yes and I pointed out that this Nick lied and this was a part of the upset. Nick lied about doing a refund. He wouldn't call a manager and caused upset and I will let my friends know who play the course about the horrible treatment and how it is not run professionally. They should have called the Pro right away when requested, not lied to the customer, honored the coupon, given the refund  the first time requested.  We play all over the valley and this is the first time ever that there has been such and issue for a fun day of golf. Sad!"}
{"text":"Awatukee Country Club is in very bad shape. Dusty tee boxes, overbooked, hardly any green grass and they are lacking enough water stations. The course has few or no signs and they have the nerve to continually reprimand people who cannot find the first tee boxes. (Apparently the starter has developed a little reputation with the locals as a grouch.)  Besides the poor course conditions what's worse here are the hilariously uppity attitudes of the club house staff and course starter. The owners/management must not teach a service oriented mindset because this crew seems to feel quite entitled to treat players poorly. I'm sure the staff believes it's their job to regulate and discipline but they need to add a dose of humility and service. Be happy some people are still coming.  Avoid Awatukee Country Club."}
