{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Great wraps.  I had the Piggy and my wife had the veggie version.  We also tried a scone which went great with coffee.  Also,  great spot to grab a good 6 pack of IPA or wine."}
{"text":"Love these ladies!! Their sandwiches are to die for. Especially the Philly. They have a nice wine and beer selection as well. The shop is so convenient for morning coffee and grabbing wine for the evening."}
{"text":"Gitta's Table is a hidden treasure in Avon Lake.  They have a nice beer and wine selection, the service is always terrific, and the food is fantastic!  The items on the regular menu are creative, fresh, and delicious.  Also, definitely check out their daily specials.  The special sandwiches are always delicious.  The other day I had the special, which was green chili smoked pork, jalapeños, cheddar cheese, spinach and tomatoes.  OMG -- it was out of this world!  Also, make sure you pick up some dessert.  Their cookies are awesome. My favorites are the snickerdoodles and the oatmeal raisin."}
{"text":"I live in Lakewood and drive all the way to Avon Lake to patronize Gitta's Shop!  Gitta and her staff go out of the way to make sure you get what you want!  I attended a beer tasting over the summer and was introduced to some fabulous flavors I only now find at Gitta's...and will continue to return over and over!  Compliments and kudos on every aspect of the experience!"}
{"text":"A great little non-chain, fresh choice place. I live very close and I love that it still has the \"Wine Shop\" feel. I love the wraps and having a close place for coffee. My friends enjoy it too, I have not heard a bad review. Great job! I like to support small businesses."}
{"text":"Quality! Fresh ingredients.  I recently had a delicious  tuna salad sandwich  and my daughter enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap.  Hearty soups- the clam chowder is a favorite.  I attended a very informative and fun wine tasting at Gitta's.  If you are in the mood for a craft beer, they have many interesting choices.   You can't go wrong at this classy, quaint shop!"}
{"text":"1. Chicken tortilla dip, amazing. 2. Cinnamon rolls, don't be fooled by the looks, these are good! 3. Porkies,  sandwich, yummy.  4. The Bellini? Turkey,carmelized onions, avacado, omg my favorite. Way big enough to share.  5. Cookies and muffins, very good 6. Service is Always friendly.  7. Quiche, one of my favorites.

{"text":"The pressed BELLIE sandwich is PHENOMENAL!!!!! I ate half and stopped to tell YOU about it!  Gotta go....the other half is waiting on me!!"}
{"text":"Quite underwhelmed with my sandwich (first visit). Chicken salad was OK, nothing special. The roll however was hard, hard, hard. Almost inedibly hard. I will definitely give them another chance, as I am happy to have more independent places within our city limits."}
{"text":"Just had the Piggy sandwich. Delicious and perfect with any beer they sell there. Hit the spot again. Thanks."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant on lake road in avon lake.  Food is awesome and the owners treat you like family. Wonderful small business to support"}
{"text":"I love going to Gitta' s. I was there 3x this week. Lunch with a friend. Hot chocolate date with my oldest son and breakfast with a friend. She even stocks my favorite beer just because I was sad it was out of stock. If you get a chance, go to a wine tasting. Friendly service, good food, good alcohol and small locally owned. Perfect for me."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is so good, and they have a wide variety of wine and craft beer. It always feels good to support family owned businesses, especially ones like this where the owner is on premises with warm greetings and a genuine  smile. Good job!"}
{"text":"A really cute deli. My vegetarian sandwich was very, very tasty.  Although the deli does not offer a kids menu, my two girls were able to special order the simple sandwiches they like. The sugar cookies we had for dessert were amazingly good!  My only suggestion would be the addition of an espresso machine."}
{"text":"Went there last night . Gitta and Marget are friendly and talented. I got a wrap (sorry, forgot the name) with chicken , hummus, cucumber, sun-dried tomatoes etc, and it was great. Diane had a ham and cheese on the crusty roll and she loved it. I couldn't pass up the gazpacho, which was fresh and flavorful. I know nothing about wine, but it appears like they have a nice selection. I wish the menu was larger but that may come with time. They really cleaned the place up. Avon Lake needs a place like this."}
{"text":"I have gone to Gitta's quite a few times now for breakfast- a great option in the neighborhood. Especially if you drive by- order ahead! We get the breakfast burrito which is so yummy- nice mixture of eggs with tomatoes, sausage, potatoes and cheese with a chipotle mayo (good flavor not too spicy). It's definitely craved by the husband.  I love the egg sandwich soufflé and add ham or bacon. It's got spinach and cheese and is nicely flavored- I usually add basil mayo as well. They are both hearty breakfast options and you probably won't be able to resist the fresh baked goods!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this cozy little stop on Lake Road you need to.  Large filling delicious sandwiches and a nice wine selection as well. The weather was chilly during my visit but they also have a neat outside eating area.  The owner is wonderful and the woman working with her was very friendly and helpful as well. It's great to see small businesses succeed and this is a place you should definitely try."}
