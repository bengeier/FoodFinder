{"text":"First tried Ume because I live down the street but was very surprised by the quality and creativity of their food (all the house maki rolls are amazing and unique).  I've ordered food 3 times and it's always been great.  In fact I'm on my way there tonight to pick up party trays for my daughter's birthday.  I highly recommend UME!"}
{"text":"It's alright. A convenient place to grab sushi before heading down to the lake or the garden which is located nearby."}
{"text":"Really delicious sushi, everything was fresh. Prices are also great too, love the 2.65 dine in menu."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food - tempura shrimp was prepared fresh for our rolls, not premade.   Tuna was Pacific blue tuna, not white - a real treat.  Had the deep fried ice cream which was really lovely."}
{"text":"Been to almost every sushi spot in Toronto, and decided to try this one as it is close by home. GET THE KISS OF FIRE ROLL!!! Best sushi i have ever tasted :') this roll is amazing even though its 10.50$ it is sooooooooooooo worth it. Tempura was hot n fresh, salmon tasted great too. Kiss of fire roll has spicy salmon and shrimp temp inside, on top is white fish, jalapeno, sirracha!! sooooo good for raw fish eaters."}
{"text":"We had takeout for dinner. The food was actually quite good. Comparable to any sushi I've had in the city and we used to live in the downtown core. 

Great value too. Our bill was $23 for an order that would've cost $40 anywhere else. 

We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Ume Fashion Sushi is our favorite Sushi take-out place ever since it opened it's door almost 2 months ago; we are so happy that they've come to our neighborhood!

The sushi we had (once a week since they opened their doors) - usually taking a few of the house special rolls - were consistently fresh, very flavorful in a beautiful presentation.

The quality of the sushi is amazing and the house special rolls that we have been taking are truly creative and absolutely delicious. Perhaps a bit unusual (have tried lots of sushi places before but these are truly one-of-a-kind) but highly recommendable. Some of our favorite rolls are golden California roll, volcano roll, dragon roll, dancing angel roll and passion roll. 

On top of great sushi, the service is good - quick and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Ordered UME Fashioni Sushi delivery and their food was just wonderful.  Spicy Sushi Tartar was fantastic !  Good food !"}
{"text":"Dropped in again last night.  As always, the food was great.  For anyone in the Kingston, Warden, Birchmount streets area, you should check it out."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading all these good reviews about it. I was actually very impressed! I ordered the passion roll, dragon roll, volcano roll and the dancing angel roll. Lots of use of mayo in these rolls which made it taste yummy. The presentation was very pleasing to the eye! Freshly made and delicious for a sushi joint in Scarborough. I'm going to try their sashimi next time. The bill came up to $39 with 10% off if you come by to pick it up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been doing more take out recently and with our latest sushi craving, we ended up ordering from Ume Fashion Sushi. Looking at the Yelp reviews, we figured it would be a decent place to get food from as the ratings were fairly high. However we were wrong.

Upon scanning the menu, it seemed decent. Prices were a bit high but we figured it would still be cheaper than dining-out. We made a $50 purchase which included 5 rolls and a beef teriyaki bento box.

The beef teriyaki bento box was $16.95 so we figured there would be quite a bit of food. However, we got about 7 small strips of beef drenched in sauce. The beef was chewy and difficult to eat. The amount of rice was unimpressive and the miso soup was grainy and unpleasing. The bento included 5 pieces of sushi (3 salmon and 2 shrimp) and a 4-piece California roll. The sushi was quite small and the salmon was cut really thin. It was nothing special. I don't like California rolls as I'm a fan of raw fish so I don't want to give a bias review on the Cali rolls. Overall, it was a pathetic amount of food that didn't even taste that good.
We struggled to finish the food, not because there was too much but because we found it difficult to get down. The spicy salmon rolls we ordered didn't taste very fresh and we felt sick after eating the meal. 

We easily spend $50 when we dine out for sushi but the quality we get is so much better. I think I'd prefer just going out to sushi places I trust rather than ordering delivery from a place called Ume Fashion Sushi."}
{"text":"I tried this spot out because of such positive reviews - however I fail to see the sort of quality everyone is raving about. I chose the chicken teriyaki - and it was ok, standard stuff. And a spicy salmon, it wasn't tightly rolled like I prefer and was a bit mushy - didn't hit the spot like my scarborough favourite does. The seaweed salad, seemed a bit more intense than it usually is anywhere else. Didn't taste anything special in the miso soup either. Sigh I'll give it another chance again - maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"A tiny restaurant that truly cares about what they do. 

I had perfectly ripe and fresh avocado sushi with crispy tempura bits. Delicious! I also had a veggie tempura that was super crispy and light! Not oily or soggy!!! A lovely surprise was the asparagus in my tempura selection. 

Thank you Ume Fashion! I can't wait to come back to sample more items from the menu. I will update my review!"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from Ume. This is my 3rd time ordering. Love the food. We had Cajun White Tuna Mango(favourite), Veg Tempura, Kiss of Fire and Dancing Angel Roll. They were all amazing!!! I'm so happy they are located across the street."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5 

I went here a few weeks ago to order some sushi for takeout. The restaurant itself is very tiny, which is why I decided to get it to go instead of eating in. They do have some very good deals though if you choose to dine in. The maki rolls were not rolled as tightly as at some other sushi places, and therefore tended to fall apart easily. Despite this, they still tasted very good. The people working there were very nice, and overall, I enjoyed my experience. I will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I get weekly takeout from here for our sushi cravings! Very reasonable pricing for really good quality sashimi and sushi. Tempura is made freshly to order and excelle"}
{"text":"Don't be turned away by the size and decor.  The sushi is amazing.  The price is reasonable and the service is really good. You can do take out too."}
{"text":"Found this sushi joint on Skip The Dishes and tried them out; I ordered B7 - Shrimp Tempura.  I was satisfied with the portion, packaging, and presentation.  My veggie tempuras were slightly oily but overall the food was delicious.  I'll order again from them however I think I'll order directly from the store for delivery, as Skip the Dishes took forever."}
{"text":"Great east end spot.  Not much to look at on the inside but the sushi is fresh and delicious.  Cheap and tasty it's become our go to."}
{"text":"When I first came in the restaurant I didn't have very high hopes because of the restaurant's size and the fact that we were the only customers. However, I was really surprised because everything tasted so good! We chose to order form the dine in special because everything was around $2.50 per item so we got to try a bit of everything for under $20!

I recommend sushi pizza, spicy salmon rolls and the shrimp tempura rolls (I'm not sure if that was the exact name)."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place. Great value and always super fast delivery and fresh sushi. The sides are mediocre, but a+ for rolls."}
{"text":"So let me just start off by saying, do not get discouraged of how tiny the restaurant is b/c the sushi blew me away from the water.. ( get it cuz sushi has fish LMFAo)))
Anyways, we decided to order from the dine in special because it was only like $2 and I ordered a bunch of rolls and the total ended up to be $15 :DDDDDDDDD I don't remember all the rolls but i do remember getting chicken wings as appetizer :P check out the picture and I think that should just show you how appetizing the rolls look. Trust me when i say this, they all tasted incredible. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who is craving sushi, and lives around the area."}
{"text":"Everything was good at Ume sushi: good service, good taste, and good price. The inside of the restaurant is simple, and will fool you right away."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi spot!!! Best spicy salmon, shrimp tempura roll and spicy crabmeat roll I have ever had... the place does look a little sketchy but the sushi is well worth it"}
{"text":"The day we visited, they were having a $2.65 (per item) dinner promotion when you dine-in. This hole in the wall restaurant may not look enticing but there food and pricing is just so good! Try it out! 

Our faves are the following: 
1. Tempura - freshly cooked and you can't smell the oil that was used for deep-frying.
2. Tempura roll - they have a different take for this one. I think they added some kind of mayonnaise that makes it more tasty - not too boring for your taste buds."}
{"text":"Don't let the decor and location throw you off. The sushi here is really good!! Highly recommend the Ume roll and the kiss of fire roll!!"}
{"text":"I had delivery, food came 30 minutes after call for $40 worth of food. Tasted great and ordered a type of ice cream still came frozen throughout delivery. Overall for delivery great option!"}
