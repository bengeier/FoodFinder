{"text":"We ordered from here for the first time the other day, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Both medium pizzas had grease bleeding through the boxes, so much so that it left some on the table when we were done. Also most pizza is good the next day for left overs this was not. Probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. A good amount of cheese without a heart attack inducing amount of grease."}
{"text":"Pizza was very very good but one star off for poor call centre and ok delivery."}
{"text":"Pizza good with decent amount of toppings.  Quality is consistent, sort of tastes like pizza hut back in the 90's, when pizza hut was good"}
{"text":"There pizza is good! It has all the flavors you are looking for and will definitely fill you up after a slice or two. The only thing that I have a complaint about is the sun dried tomatoes. They used to put big horizontally sliced sundries tomatoes under the cheese so that you could actually taste and see it, but now they are chopping it up and you honestly CANNOT even tell they have used sun dried tomatoes. It is disappointing because it is a topping you pay for and you can't even notice that it is there."}
{"text":"I do not want this review to replace other reviews. The way I see it is I'm visiting again, so I'm reviewing it again  I've been playing an online game called Cupcakeria and where I try to make the very specific perfect cupcake ordered. Many times I get 95% plus but there are some bad ones that might get 80% plus. I make a bad cupcake, and some people make a bad pizza and chefs make a bad dish, but it is the overall consistency that is important.  My pizza was not perfect or as good as previous times. One side was a lot doughier than the other. One half was supposed to have chicken and red peppers, but near the border there was hardly any chicken and when cut into slices, one slice was mainly cheese and red pepper.  The large 3 topping pizza pick up at $10.99 is still the best value for the money I think.  The wife says she's finally over her recent pizza cravings I'm not sure I believe her.  3.75 stars. So it was 8.75/10 last time. I would give it 7.75 this time.  P.S. If you don't know, a Mega is between a XL and a party size."}
{"text":"We picked this pizza place upon Yelp reviews, we were deceived.  I would say Reginos pizza belongs to the same category as Pizza Pizza.  The pizza was ok, but nothing special. Service was courteous and quick."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Flavourful. Sauce is so good and pizza crust. Really reasonably priced as well"}
{"text":"This place was terrible.  Very high price, dough was not well kneeded, also toppings and cheese were not very high quality.  Would not order again from here, many better offerings within seeing distance of their location."}
{"text":"Great solid pizzeria. I get pizza at least once a week, so I've tried out all the local joints , and in my opinion, this is the best place in the area. Their walk-in and managers specials are amazing value. Their toppings are flavorable and plentiful. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"4 stars in its category (greasy fast food) Good pizza on a fluffy chewy crust. Great wings too. This will be our new go-to for pizza night."}
{"text":"open till late on the weekends with the amazing service they provide is why this is probably the best pizza store you can go to. Not to mention their amazing pizza and fresh toppings ;)"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in town. Fresh dough made in house,  the finest quality of cheese with real tomato sauce which you can taste the difference and abundance of fresh cut toppings. Local favourite!"}
{"text":"Not much sauce (which made it dry) and only 3 pepperoni on each slice I had.   I walked in and grabbed two pieces. Maybe if you order ahead of time they are more generous with the toppings. Won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"Love this pizza place. Consistently great. Crave it all the time and order it weekly! Best Hawaiian pizza and BBQ wings"}
{"text":"This location has been a pizza shop of some kind or another for as long as I can remember!!  Since it's been a Regino's, it's been my destination for pizza.  Fast, fresh, plus they have a great three topping pickup special!  I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"First time ordering here. As usual I ordered half cooked pizza and finished it at home. The cheese was gooey and delish. I would order from here again as the price was right and the pizza was above average. I think this place in Aurora has been overlooked by the residents and highly recommended  it."}
{"text":"Bad tasting, Dirty workers. The workers don't take showers and the store looks and smells musty."}
{"text":"Best pizza of my entire life. The woman normally working is as sweet as can be. Open late. Great after getting drunk. Really great all the time though. My boyfriend could literally drink their garlic dip"}
{"text":"I go to Reginos often, it's my go to pizza place. I'm more accustomed to the pharmacy and Danforth locations so it was my first time in this location. The people were friendly, the pizza came on time. The pizza itself wasn't as good as other locations I feel, but it was still good."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place, AND my go to!  Nice flavouring pizzas. Different varieties. Delicious sauces. Wonderful hard workers that deliver fast. Great place to order from when you're gonna be home Netflixing all day."}
{"text":"Ok let me be the first to review this place...   Pizza pizza, forget about it! Pizza hut, forget bout it! Any other pizza place forget bout it.   Reginos pizza is amazing!  They have great pizza made with amazing sauce, fresh toppings, and a savory soft crust.  The price is very reasonable and I guarantee you will cry on your first bite lol.  I don't know what else to say.  We ordered a half and half pizza.  First half was steak strips, second half was extra cheese mushrooms and chicken.. Both amazingly great!  I highly recommend this for ppl who love pizza you will be happy you had ataste of reginos"}
{"text":"Had the large three topping (Deluxe) walk-in special for 11 dollars.  Let's go through the pros and cons:  Pros:  Bread:  Light and delicious.  This is something that could stand on its own.  Really good.  Cheese:  Flavourful and ample.   Price:  Good value, especially on their walk-in and daily specials.  Cons:  Mushrooms:  Cut too thin to deliver any taste.  Green Peppers:  Cut thicker than the mushrooms so there's some texture but not much taste.  Sauce:  Flavourful but like most places these days, one scoop is pretty much all you get and most pizzas are lacking in this ingredient that's supposed to bring all the flavours together.  Pepperoni:  Some flavour but cut razor thin.  Also, not fooling anyone by putting it on the crust which should be ingredient free.  Skimpy too but that's not surprising.  Most places no longer give one full layer of pepperoni anymore.  A good pizza is one where you can taste each ingredient and one where all those flavours are brought together by a flavourful sauce and a good crust.  Overall, Reginos is an alternative, but not the best (nor the worst) alternative."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE their pizza! The crust is just thick enough and there isn't an excess of dough. They are quite generous with their sauce and toppings. Just keep in mind, there isn't a lot of space in the store!"}
{"text":"The delivery took over an hour. Pizza was cold. I'm sure warm it would actually taste ok."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats, and the food was made fast, and fresh!  Got 2 medium pizzas with 3 toppings and a small side for $24. The pizza was nicely loaded with toppings, and really delicious!  The garlic bread with cheese was also good, tons of melted cheese on top.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Summary: big portion, good price, generous topping quantity. If you're fine with cheese on top of toppings as opposed to under, this is the best consistent pizza spot in this part of town.  This small shop a block and a half south of the Domino's is in the same plaza as Fahmees Bakery, which means it's really hard for me to go anywhere else when I'm in the area.  But I'm really, really glad I gave this a shot, because they honestly have the best value for pizza on a consistent basis. Yes, when Domino's has the 50% off deal, it's a better buy - but Reginos doesn't need sporadic deals to offer great value.  They put the cheese on top of the toppings here, and they only have two service staff. Our order for a specific time ended up 10 minutes late... And that's about the only complaint I have.  Other pizza shops offer a very standard option for toppings. Reginos goes all out with a variety (see menu pics)  Other pizza shops sometimes really skimp out on some of the unique toppings (spinach, for example). Reginos PACKS it on.   Tasted great and would come back! Plus, they now have online ordering too. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall pizza joint with only one worker who manically runs the cash register then runs back to make the food. Compared to the branch near Finch and Brimley, this branch is more generous with their cheese and the crust is not dry. They are both, however, generous with their delicious toppings and are reasonably priced with daily and walk in specials (see pics and tips).   Tried their buffalo crispy (it wasn't crispy) wings tossed in bbq sauce with a side of their suicide sauce for hubby. Wings were meaty and the flavor combination was delicious. Suicide sauce was hot but if you're Jamaican/Thai/Sri Lankan then it's not that hot.  Solid place to get decent fast food pizza. PS prices have changed as evidenced on all the big \"X\" written on their menu boards, read their paper menus for updated prices."}
{"text":"Would of gave a 4 or a 5 I have been coming here a few months now, and I went in for my usual order, only this time it was for lunch with the kids during the day. The staff at night always allowed me to order there walking 3 topping special with a quarter of it only cheese for my picky 5 year old daughter. Well not this afternoon they were completely unsympathetic to my situation of having 1 out of 4 people only like cheese pizza l, they told me they could not do a quarter of Ly half even after I made valid points about how, I spend $40 a week there and that by giving me a quarter cheese they were actually saving ingredients, thus saving money. SMH don't no if ill return"}
{"text":"Much better option than the other options for pizza in the area.  They don't skimp on the toppings, walk in specials are a great deal.  Just really good pizza."}
{"text":"Terrific pizza place - the best in the area as far as pizza chains go (without going gourmet). Dough/crust is good, even the whole wheat one. Cheese is excellent, great flavour and nice stringiness. Sauce is good as well. There's a pretty strong offering of a variety of toppings and the pizza is topped generously with them.   Prices are a great value - think of this place as Pizza Nova quality (even slightly better I'd say), but with Domino's pricing.  That they deliver is an added plus. Pizza came hot and on time. Wish that the person taking the order on the phone was a bit friendlier and confirmed the total pricing after taxes before hanging up though."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Reginos Pizza, good priced & good pizza. However, the more pizza places I try the more I dislike Reginos.   Now their prices & delivery/preparation time is good. The issue is mainly with the pizza. Reginos likes to put a lot more topping than they do cheese or even sauce. So if you order a veggie pizza you're basically eating dough with vegetables. If this is something you enjoy or look for in a pizza, you'd love this. Their dipping sauces, however, are one of the best.   While it used to be one of my go to places, I think other competitors just do pizza better.   PSA: don't get the wings, taste like you bought them from the frozen aisle & made them at home."}
{"text":"This used to be a frequent stop back in my young, lightning-fast, metabolic rate days.  I used to always come here for lunch (during high school) so really, this review is based on my 16 year old self (the one who was emo and thought $20 was a looottt of money way back when...okay it was only 10 years ago...okay?!).  Anyway, I've always liked Reginos because they were very affordable and most importantly, their pizza was always hot & fresh.  They are also very generous with their cheese...which is extremely important.  I should come back here and munch on a slice one day ...!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, adequate service, nice wines, fair price in a cozy setting."}
{"text":"There are a plethora of pizza places in the area and most of them offer average pizza at prices that teeter towards gourmet than just ... oh, I don't know ... pizza from a store in a plaza.  Reginos pizza feels like it's made by someone's Italian grandmother. They're generous with the toppings while still maintaining accessible pricing.   it's also common to experience something at Reginos you don't expect at a pizza joint: good customer service. From the time they take your order though handing your pie to you they're smiling and saying thank you. It's so nice to be treated decently but so uncommon in most pizza places.  The best part about Reginos' Pizza is its balance between being greasily delicious but not too oily on your fingers. You're going to enjoy some good pie here but won't feel like you keg stand'd a grease trap when you're done.  TO SUM IT UP: Good customer service included with every satisfying pizza ordered."}
{"text":"Used to so good.  Pizza crust was raw, lasagna terrible, and caesar salad too salty."}
{"text":"Awesome. First review. I've become a big fan of Regino's pizza as of late. This is the third Regino's I've been to and so far all of them have served to notch pizza. I ordered a large pizza with my 3 favorite toppings. Pepperoni, mushrooms, and Italian sausage. The pizza dough is great, I hate pizza crusts and usually only eat it with a dip, but I eat Regino's crust (if you know what I mean). The cheese is also fantastic. Very stringy when fresh and doesn't harden up into some plastic like material. The Italian sausage... I have nothing against it. It is still delicious. I just wish that I could take the Italian sausage from pizza pizza and put it onto Regino's pizza. Have 2 Italian sausage options maybe. Any how, they have really good prices, pizza, wings and calzones so definitely try this local chain out."}
{"text":"Ordered: -walk in pizza special -chicken wings with honey garic on the side  Expectation:  -Good pizza  Reality: Loved their pizza and would pick this place over many other. Wings are not to die for, just average. But service was friendly"}
{"text":"Best pizza slices on a budget. Great crust, good quality toppings. Always fresh and delicious. Essentially take-out, there is a bar height table along the window to eat in. Most people just grab a slice and eat it in the car."}
{"text":"This is our go to location for pizza. The pizza tastes good the day of and the next day. Their deals are good and they arent stingy with toppings. Hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, but delivery is a joke. Four times I have ordered from there, and EVERY time there is an issue with delivery, not with the address, they just can't seem to make the delivery in less than 90 minutes! Talking to the manager is useless, as he plays games on the phone, talking to head office is useless because they couldn't care less. Don't bother ordering from here, they are guaranteed to let you down, they offer no remedy for the delays, so I encourage one and all to not give them your business."}
{"text":"Delicious! First time getting this pizza and it was amazing that I ate more than my average amount. The staff was also very friendly ! Only downside was the size was smaller than I thought but its affordable so I would get 2 next time!"}
{"text":"2nd best Pizza in town... Consistently high quality Pizza and decently priced.... a winning combination!!"}
