{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years and this is a first. Ordered my usual lunch, and the fries came cold over cooked and greasy, ( they were deep fried twice). My sandwich was good though so I let it go. However, my wife ordered fish tacos, and the fish were cold in the centre, and the lettuce was brown and wilting. After one bite she stopped eating I pointed out these issues to our server, she apologized, took our plates, and then charged us full price for our meals that we couldn't eat. We paid our bill and left. We are the worst kind of customer, we just don't go back, and we pass on this experience to others."}
{"text":"If I could leave less stars I would.   We came in with a large group, we check out different restaurants around the city a couple times per month.   Our server was lovely, great attitude, and she worked her butt off for us..but 20 or so people as well as having other tables would overwhelm anyone...I give her kudos for her effort though!  It would have been nice if the manager (redhead, beard, glasses) either, A got off his phone, B stopped just leaning on the bar, or C maybe helped the staff get their food out instead of sitting in the booth behind us doing nothing.   I ordered the jambalaya and for an almost 20 dollar dish, I received a plate of penne pasta in tomato sauce with 3 shrimp, 3 chunks of sausage and 4 hunks of peppers. It was watery and it didn't include any garlic toast to soak up the juices. Disappointing to say the least.   I can't say I would vote for us to return. At very least I would think the manager would have gotten off his phone or left his friends in the booth behind us, for five minutes to see if the group bringing in well over 1000.00 was enjoying our experience."}
{"text":"Came in mid afternoon.  $10 medium pizza on Mondays.  Pizza was okay. Similar to Delissios frozen.  Crust was good, toppings average. Service was non existent.  The only time we saw our waitress was when we ordered, and again when she brought the bill."}
{"text":"I had been a customer for a few years , but maybe not anymore. After taking 30 extra minutes to have my pickup order ready , they never gave me my salad. I got back home only to get told by my wife that they called and said they forgot to give it to me. Back to the restaurant only to be told to my face that I forgot to take it. I saw what she carried out from the back and a plastic bag with a salad in it was not amongst it. They insisted it was my fault. Oh well. No impressed."}
{"text":"For years we would order pizzas and they were the best in our area.  We have found recently their pizzas ingredients were of low quality and will be looking for another pizza place!"}
{"text":"Short Version: Great takeout Pizza...everything else?  Long Version: Useful restaurant reviews are all about context, so here's the context for Filos.  Filos restaurant is nestled into a dark corner of one of the most run-down shopping malls in south Calgary. The only windows look out over the deserted halls of the Deer Valley shopping center, and entering the place requires running the gauntlet of second-hand discount nicotine from the VLT jockeys and staff encamped near the front door.  That said, in the time I've lived in the neighborhood, Filos has surprised me on a couple of occasions.  The vibe is distinctly working class, but far from sketchy. Staff are friendly and the clientele seems to run older (think groups of retirees meeting for ceasars and to play the slots). I've never stuck around for more than a couple post-work beers and fried appetizers with colleagues, so I can't tell you how the dinner menu is. However, their take-out and delivery pizza is great.  These pizzas are somewhat lighter than the oft-seen Calgary \"Greek Style\" or bar pizza. They come on a nice hand-tossed crust with a well developed flavor and a good balance b/w thick and thin spots. Toppings are fresh, though lacking some of the variety found at dedicated pizza joints (no spinach?!?). At ~$20 a pie for a large pizza, they're not a ridiculously awesome value, but well worth the cost.  Up until now, we've always taken our pizza back home; however, on one of my last visits I noticed a tabletop Arkanoid machine near the kitchen door, so I may be convinced to stay in some time and give something else a try."}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night looking for a good place to go and relax. The decor is very nice - everything looks new and clean. We stood aimlessly at the front for about five minutes before deciding to seat ourselves at a dirty table. About five minutes after sitting down and joking about it (there was no sign saying to wait nor was there one saying to go ahead and take a seat) someone came and wiped down our table and gave us menu's. At this point I asked if we were supposed to have waited to be seated and the waitress laughed and giggled and gave me a total non answer about how some people wait and some people just go ahead a seat themselves - totally not helpful if we come back.  It was half price appetizers so hubby and I ordered the fish tacos, asian ribs, garlic shrimp, and calamari. The food was okay. The fish tacos were loaded - but with iceberg lettuce and very little fish or saut√©ed veggies. The ribs were really good for the first few bites - after that the salt burned the tongue. The garlic shrimp were a delight - served with plain toast so you had the option of soaking up excess butter/cheese. The calamari were good, over cooked but served with an excellent dill sauce.  Portions were medium - one person/appie would be a good idea or two to share amongst two people and then move on to your main.  Food was slowish but hot and fresh tasting coming out of the kitchen - I don't know if it was the kitchen though or the servers being slow at putting in the orders... there was a lot of time spent in front of the POS computer with puzzled expressions.  Will we go back? No. For the level of service and the speed of service the food (and thus our experience) was overpriced - even at half price."}
{"text":"I have to say we've been going for aprox 10 years and I have to say the food is always been very good and the service top notch .. the owners are always there to say hello and how you're doing .. would recommend anytime and to anyone.."}
{"text":"We continuously take out Filos pizza and I've never had a disappointing experience. It's not your standard cardboard box cheap pizza, their toppings are fresh and ever skimpy.  I'll be calling them again and again."}
{"text":"5 star review purely for one night of the week. Monday's. Medium pizza's are $12 (reg price $21-$24). A medium pizza can feed a single person. If your hungry you'll eat it all, that said; I can eat and I usually take home a few pieces rather than being stuffed.   Lots of TV's and other menu items... its a bar/pub... and it does what it does. I just wanted to give it stars and props for a delicious pizza night right by my house - woohoo!"}
{"text":"Had never been to this area before - was in between appointments with an hour to kill for lunch and a hunger on. Walking in, the restaurant is pretty large but in the daylight anyways, I noted that it could use a bit of a wipe down including plates on the tables and the floors. There are 19 video lottery terminal thingys in here at the rear that had a certain type of crowd coming in and out, going for cigarettes, in and out. I had a pineapple cooler (sealed) and ordered something simple - a veggie stir fry. Boring. Over sauced, salty noodles with a few pieces of celery, carrot, a piece of red pepper, a ton of red onion (filler) and bulk barn type unseasoned peanuts. No sesame seeds, no ginger or garlic, no snow peas, no imagination.  After 3pm on Mon and Tues is $10 pizza deal night. Perhaps this would have been a better option if the timing had worked out better. Service was fine but I would be hard pressed to return."}
{"text":"Food is great, friendly atmosphere but definitely needs improvement in the service department."}
{"text":"Decent place to stop in for a quick beverage or meal. Nothing out of this world but it's alright."}
{"text":"Pretty decent beer list by the bottle, the draft list is a bit skinny. All reports are that they do good mixed drinks though I can't vouch personally for this. They have a good weekend pizza special and otherwise their food is good as well.   Their real high point is the great service. Check it out if you're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"A definite FAVORITE if your in the south! The menu & entire place has been redone and the food is FABULOUS! Prime Rib & Lobster specials make this place the GEM! Enjoy a live band on the weekends. The owners really strive for being the BEST~ I love it!"}
{"text":"I don't know where all the negativity is coming from. Filo's is well priced, delicious, and usually very prompt. We order out and eat in quite regularly. I highly recommend the Beef&Cheddar Burger, Avocado Chicken Club, pizza, Fish Tacos, and Hunters Chicken.  The portions are huge (I've never finished a plate, and I love to eat). The burgers are handmade and seasoned deliciously! They have awesome drink and food specials, and even when they've been ridiculously busy, we've been well taken care of!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and the food is great... Service could use some improvement. Often slow."}
{"text":"The place looks way better now since the Reno but the food has gone downhill.   I used to go after work but the food quality has really become lack luster.  The limes in the drink are brown and dry.  The cheese on the pizza was weird. Th spinach salad was more then boring.  I'm out!"}
