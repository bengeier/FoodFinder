{"text":"The brisket was dry, overcooked and had no flavor (and no smoke ring). I had read the reviews,  but still decided to give it a try. Bad idea."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, great service and nice atmosphere. The wings were large, flavorful and perfectly cooked. Try the nachos too. Even the baked beans were richly flavorful. Well done!"}
{"text":"What to say about South Side BBQ ,I`ve eaten bbq ribs all over this country especially In the southern states and a lot of rib cook-offs but south side bbq has them all beat .The ribs were done to perfection , all the sides are al a cart, I had half a rack of ribs ,carolina coleslaw and bake beans the price was minimum but the best bbq around ."}
{"text":"We held a private function here on Saturday. There are not enough words to describe what a GREAT time we had here! Pat & staff went above and beyond to make our brother's 50th Birthday celebration a hit! The food is out of this world! Ribs, pulled pork sliders, Mac & cheese, Cole slaw. Every guest raved about the food and service. We will be back; may become regular customers! Thank you Pat for a memorable event!"}
{"text":"Wow - I got South Side from Grubhub - and the hotel staff that had it at the front desk were salivating. It smelled amazing and the meat was so tender and wonderfully flavored. The sweet potatoes were cinammony and a little spicy, both savory and sweet. My colleague had the corn (another sweet spicy salty flavor combo), slaw, and baked beans, which were all wonderful. Rarely have I seen this dimension of flavor from a BBQ joint! :)"}
{"text":"I had three items barbecued ribs cornbread and mac & cheese. First and foremost the cornbread was completely amazing and blew me away. The mac & cheese was also very good. The barbecue ribs had great flavor but we're pretty fatty. The prices were also very reasonable. I would definitely come back again. Check it out"}
{"text":"South Side BBQ brought their truck to our office complex- oh happy day! They were ready with an answer when I asked what the gluten free options were. All the meat options for their truck were gluten free (minus the bread). I got the pork and brisket with the slaw on the side. The meat was very tender, and all of the sauces were delicious. The slaw was on the bland side. It was more of a vinegar marinade than a creamy sauce."}
{"text":"So, why would a vegetarian go to southside BBQ, well initially, I went for the people. But, I ended up being there for the food... OMG they have (are going to have) BBQ tofu. It is not on the menu yet, but if you ask, they may be able to make some. It is amazing. So amazing that after my first bite I freaked out a little because I wasn't positive it wasn't smoked chicken on that bun! Seriously! Also, all of the sides are veg friendly except the beans and they are all really tasty. I liked the ghost pepper BBQ sauce, because I love all things spicy, but my friends said all of the sauces were good. Great place!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time today. I had a half rack of ribs and the ghost pepper mac-n-cheese. The ribs had a good flavor but they were definitely not the best I've ever had. The meat was not falling off the bone and they were fairly fatty. The mac-n-cheese was good but other than having some heat, it wasn't anything spectacular in terms of flavor. I would order it again if I go because I do like hot foods. I may go back and give their wings a try because they do make a tasty sauce. I'm not sure I would order the ribs again.   It has a nice casual atmosphere and the guy working was very friendly."}
{"text":"Make sure if you are in Pitt on the South Side YOU GOTTA GO to this place. Thw Carolina Reaper sauce is a new sauce thwy juat made and it ROCKS.....just enough heat with excellent flavor....I'm serious! I cannor stand so hot tou cannot enjoy the sauce and/or the food itself. Make sure you come here!!!"}
{"text":"I love the South Side BBQ Company! I used to grab lunch from the truck every Friday I could when they would park near my office building. I miss it and wish they were able to come back! I've ordered the Redneck Club and Pulled Pork sandwiches multiple times, and both are delicious. The pulled pork in particular has the perfect texture, with larger chunks of meat and smaller, shredded pieces mixed evenly throughout. The coleslaw and sauces are also thin and taste more vinegar-based, which is my favorite style of BBQ. I've never been a fan of thick, overly sweet BBQ sauce or viscous coleslaw. The owners also seem like really awesome guys, so it was always a pleasure giving them my business. I'm excited to see they're still doing events around the city, and I'll for sure track them down next time they're in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I want to give it a try , cozy but without any flavor to be remembered   The best dish was the Chicken and the Nachos with pulled chicken  The pulled pork was Ok, the fries were pretty good  The worst was the Brisket.... don't ask for it.  I"}
{"text":"Couldn't resist coming back to this hole in the wall. What great people and the smoked wings are amazing. They are $1.25 a piece on Wednesdays. You must try these. BEST EVER! Since this last visit was on a Tuesday got the wings appetizer and the special which was a hot sausage Sammy. Was really good. Go to this place!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I recently went on their wing night...so I had to try the wings! If you like smoked whole wings, this is the place! Be smart when ordering! I order 6 and a side of mac n cheese and had leftovers!   The pepperjack mac n cheese is great! it's not too spicy, but has a nice kick!   The ribs and brisket are also bomb!   I have only been there on week nights and there is a decent crowd. A good place to watch a game!!  Everyone is super friendly and will help you order if needed! Def check it out if you are looking for good bbq!"}
{"text":"Ribs were great and falling off the bone! I regret not getting the barbicone but I was able to have a bite from my friend who did order it and I will definitely be getting that the next time we go back"}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious. I love the pulled chicken and pork. The sauces are yummy! And the mac m cheese is to die for.  I've only eaten at the store front in south side. My partner in crime always get the barbacone...or two.  Its mac n cheese pulled pork and jalepenos.   The bartender/server is super awesome. So nice!"}
{"text":"Cool little place off the beaten path in Southside I finally had a chance to check out...ordered the half rack of ribs and ghost pepper mac n cheese and my friend had the half bbq chicken and fresh cut fries and cornbread...all were delicious! My only complaint? All but the fries were lukewarm. We sat at the bar and Chad the bartender was friendly and attentive and mixes up a wicked bloody Mary...will definitely be back! Oh, and the cornbread? Heaven!"}
{"text":"We went to this place because we like BBQ and we were hungry. I had seen the reviews on this place before coming to them and was excited to eat there. I don't know why the reviews are so high of this place. The brisket was tough and had no flavor. My husband got a 3 meat mea which had ribs, chicken and brisket and barely ate any of it...he hated it. The ribs were fatty and very tough. The only thing I enjoyed were the brisket nachos they were really good. I have had way better bbq and just because you put bbq sauce on some meat doesn't make it bbq. It was very expensive for what it was also. I guess if you are on lunch and hit up the food truck it would be a good quick lunch but we were not pleased with the food we got."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for barbecue ribs and macaroni and cheese in a laid-back, casual atmosphere. I've heard their her items are good too, but I've only had the ribs and the macaroni and cheese. It's fun to saddle up at the bar, drink a beer, and eat some good barbecue.  I especially love spicy food, and sometimes their ghost pepper macaroni and cheese is what is needed to totally satisfy the craving!   The place has a sense of humor, with \"hot\" and \"not\" sauces and the BarBaCone, all of which I enjoy.   Service is good. The place is small enough that you don't ever feel like you can be overlooked, even when it's bustling.   I really like this place and I highly recommend their food."}
{"text":"Wow, heaven definitely has this menu! Such a cute place - I ordered the Ribs:  so tender, they fall right apart, in the most delicious sauce! We had the family platter of sides, so good! My favorite is the grilled sweet potato slices, i seriously could eat these daily. The pepperjack mac n cheese just enough spice without too much heat, baked beans with the perfect balance of sweet and savory, plus the most scrumptious smooth cornbread served warm with butter! Fresh coleslaw also on the platter, very mildly dressed.  The man ordered \"The Carnivore\" -  smoked chicken, brisket, and more of those mouthwatering ribs. I'm hoping to go for the Bar-ba-cone next time. Four wonderful BBQ sauces and napkin dispensers at each table! They have happy hours and specials daily. Watch for their food truck and get some!"}
{"text":"After stalking this food truck at enough food truck round-ups, we decided to check out the actual brick and mortar restaurant.  And we weren't disappointed!  We went on a Friday night around 7PM.  It was busy, but not packed.  They had a live musician who was very cognizant that we were sitting about 2 feet from his speakers having conversations.  He played some lovely background music on his guitar with his soulful voice.  The atmosphere is your typical dive-y BBQ joint, nothing fancy, but the food here is what shines!  We tried the brisket nachos.  They were okay, but not the star of the night.  They would be good for a late night snack.  The star here is the chicken wings.  OMG.  THE CHICKEN WINGS.  They are so tender, so delicious.  I am drooling just thinking about them.  These are what make us follow the food truck around.  They are the whole wing and you must try them.  I had the pulled pork and tried all the various BBQ sauces which were all tasty.  I love Carolina style BBQ sauce and theirs does not disappoint.  We got the Family Style Platter for sides which was a great idea when you have a few folks gathered around the table.  My personal faves include the mac and cheese.  Love the spice the pepperjack adds.  The cornbread is sweet, and rich, and melts in your mouth.  We got the bacon brownie with ice cream and it was salty and sweet and delicious!  Overall, I can't wait to get back here and next time I will make sure I do not wear a white shirt!!"}
{"text":"A last minute decision to try this place. Service was great. But wished the food was better. I tried the Carnivore Platter. Liked the ribs and pulled chicken, but not a fan of the brisket. The slaw was really good."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I know I have read criticisms about portions and cost but chill out people, it is delicious!!! I went with my fella the other day and we were nervous because there was a huge crowd in there to see a young man and his guitar (i will let that nonsense slide) but we were served quickly and everything was insanely good!  I ordered the redneck club which has both pulled pork and brisket on it, along with some slaw...So, basically all of my dreams came true. And then I ordered the ghost pepper mac n' cheese as well. It is super spice and even more so when you add the inferno that is the ghost pepper bbq sauce. I loved it! My boyfriend ordered the ribs and the pepper jack mac n' cheese and was really happy with both. The ribs are intimidatingly large and a half rack was more than enough! The sauces are also all so delicious. I love the Carolina style sauce! It is my favorite! I always forget that it is tucked down 17th street but I think I will make more of an effort to fit into our routine of Gaucho and Carson Street Deli."}
{"text":"Met up with this truck at the coffee Buddha food truck Roundup. Had to try their unique version of an ice cream cone called Barbacone. They use a waffle cone place macaroni and cheese in the bottom next pulled pork  and then topped with coleslaw. It is a complete barbecue meal in an easy to hold cone. The only problem that we had with this interesting concoction was that we let it sleep in the box too long and it became a bit soggy. Totally our fault so we would like to try it again fresh out of the truck. We also got the three giant barbecued wings. They were tender and the char was perfect. I'm sure I'll be buying these every time I see this truck. Looking forward to our next food rendezvous!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was really good. The best parts of the meal were ribs, mac n cheese, and the cornbread."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The menu had a great selection of smoked meats and daily specials. I got a LOT of food for the price I was charged - a large chili mac and cheese, cornbread, and a side of mac and cheese for just $16. The service was quick and the waiter made good recommendations. My only complaint is that the bathrooms could use some updating."}
{"text":"Lets start off by saying I've eaten some pretty amazing BBQ and some pretty awful food in my life. This place falls in the category of awful. BBQ sauce is thin, runny and tasteless. Mac N Cheese can bs be shown up by Stouffers. Cornbread was a $4 ripoff. Pulled pork wasnt bad tho but when everything else is subpar the meat doesnt come close to save this place."}
{"text":"Pat catered our tailgate on Sunday after a recommendation from a friend.. #1 met me at the spot #2 provided everything we needed plates, utensils , chafing dishes and sterno .  #3 Ribs Pulled pork and sides Jalapeno Mac and Cheese and the slaw - were the \"BOMB\" .  not oversmoked, had nice flavor, also got whole smoked wings with a terrific dry rub not too hot but had enough spice.  Wings were juicy - he pays attention to his smoker because It is easy to over cook those for sure.   I cant wait to go to the restaurant, in fact I may go down on Friday!!!! NICE WORK SOUTH SIDE BBQ Company.  Reasonable too !!!!"}
{"text":"Came into town for business and we stumbled on this gem after taking a wrong turn. We decided to give it a try because the pictures on the food truck looked legit. We walked in and were told to grab a seat anywhere. We looked over the menu and I decided to go big or go home with the full rack of ribs, It was my best decision that day. The ribs showed up with beans and slaw, and the rest is history. Give this place a try... solid restaurant, with fantastic food and unique atmosphere.  P.S - ask to see the chef(head cook and bottle washer), he is a funny guy"}
{"text":"This review is for delivery only. I was pleasantly surprised that the order showed up fairly quickly and still hot. The ribs were super tasty, although very fatty. I got the greens with hominy and coleslaw for sides. The greens were fantastic! A good serving size and I ate the whole side myself and I don't even feel bad about it! The coleslaw was a vinegar base I believe, and not mayo. If it was mayo, it was really thin. I wish it had a little more flavor to it. I tried a bite of baked beans and they were pretty tasty.   I'd definitely order from them again and maybe try another meat instead of the ribs. Again, the ribs were really good... I didn't even need to use the extra BBQ sauce I ordered, just really fatty, so it was a bummer to not have more meat on the bones. Glad this is an option for at home and good to know what to order if I'm at the restaurant or see their food truck out and about!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday for some dinner and boy was I surprised! The service (it was one guy) was really good and he was trying his best to take care of everyone despite it being pretty busy. He was very nice and courteous to me and my friends.  I got the redneck club which had brisket and pulled pork. It was topped with cole slaw and I got a side of fries. And can I say that it was freaking delicious!! I haven't really been able to find good bbq worth the price in Pittsburgh but I was really impressed by this place.  Prices aren't too horrible considering how expensive BBQ usually is. This place is actually decently priced and for the portions and quality of the food, I think it's really worth it. It's a small establishment with a bar and some TVs. It's a really casual and comfortable atmosphere. I would definitely come here again."}
