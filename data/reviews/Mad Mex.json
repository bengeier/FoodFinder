{"text":"Good bar food. Great decor. All mexican theme served with an attitude.  Not sure shy, but servers were not friendly. Will be back for the mixed drinks but expect a hangover.   Very Good for Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Mad Mex in Canonsburg on Sunday after a Steelers game. First we got the San Francisco wings, the sauce was good. However, we asked for extra crispy and they didn't come out the way we hoped. We both got drinks, she got the raspberry daiquiri and I a miller lite. Both were good. I got the steak and shrimp fajitas and she got the beef tacos. My fajitas were great but the only thing, the waitress forgot my shells which she corrected the issue immediately."}
{"text":"GLUTEN SENSITIVE DINERS BEWARE. For the second visit in a row, our request for a gluten-free salad was ignored, and flour tortillas were included in my wife's plate even though she told the waitress she has an allergy to gluten.  The waitress blamed the kitchen for ignoring our request. Thankfully the manager resolved the issue quickly and removed the salad from our bill, which is why I'm giving this review three stars.  The takeaway here is to be careful when ordering gluten-free items if you have an allergy, because you may need to double check your food or risk getting sick."}
{"text":"First time at lakeside.  Horrible service marginal burrito. Very disappointed. Bartenders were more focused on talking to each other and cleaning the back bar then taking care of the customers."}
{"text":"Fantastic food- excellent beer selection- service is fast and friendly!!!! Canonsburg lake never looked so good!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried this location 2x, trust me, that's all it took!  I don't go out to dinner to get treated rudely by any staff, my money can spend anywhere! And they mail you out in the local flyer coupons, which they won't even accept here!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! But we were a party of 7 and the table they gave us was too small. Again, the food was awesome, but our seating area was also cold. There was a draft coming from somewhere."}
{"text":"Mad Max has been a favorite of mine for years and I love the new location at Lakeside. I did have a disappointing order for takeout but management made it right . Thanks to all for being so nice  and I'm looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"This was a very nice red Mexican restaurant. My only drawback was that they did not serve free chips and salsa with my meal and that is a must for me. I mean, what Mexican restaurant doesn't serve free chips and salsa if they're Mexican restaurant? But, the Margaritas were good and the food was exceptionally good. I must also say that the food was affordable. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Mad mex has a nice atmosphere but it's nothing compared to Old Mexico in Washington, pa.  We weren't mad that we went to mad mex it just cost more and the food wasn't nearly as good as Old Mexico in Washington!! If you want authentic Mexican go to Old Mexico!!!! Trust me you will be pleased ...and they have the best margaritas in town!!"}
{"text":"Typical Mad Mex but with a amazing view ! Really cool atmosphere due to the location it sits over looking a lake Indoor outdoor seating rather busy in the evening and on the weekends. Good service and Food. Just really love the location and its views"}
{"text":"This place is awesome all around. Great atmosphere and service.  Even on packed nights the food will come in a decent time. The flank steak grilled corn tacos are my personal go to. The margaritas are tasty and well worth the price. This place blows normal Mexican restaurants out of the water."}
{"text":"In my 20s, I loved the Mad Mex on Atwood Street in Oakland.  The lighting was nonexistent, the music a bit loud, and the accommodations were on the cozy side. Still, I found all of that charming.  And, of course, I dug the burritos, enchiladas, tacos, quesadillas, and nachos.  The extensive craft beer selection was also a huge plus.  As a 40something suburbanite, I could not be more pleased to find this reproduced at the \"Lakeside\" location.  I split guac & chips w/ the wife and kiddos.  Superb. I favor barbacoa quesadillas, and these were top notch.  My kids dug their chicken tacos and my better half very much enjoyed her chicken quesadillas (ours is a chicken family!).    I have low expectations for margaritas at these places (i.e., any restaurant other than the Cactus Cantina in DC), so I gravitate toward the cervezas.  My wife, however, is a margarita enthusiast, so she partook and shared with me.  My verdict:  middle of the road.  If you want to taste alcohol in this drink you need to direct them to add tequila liberally.  I would love to see Mad Mex up their margarita game and I'll report back if/when this happens.  No, this is not Atwood Street.  But, the atmosphere here is excellent.  The lighting is low, if you like that sort of thing (I do).  The staff seems very nice and attentive.  Our waitress was pleasant and patient w/ my 4 year-old.  Being good to the kids always wins points with this patron.  I love this place and look forward to returning.  *** UPDATE from 3/25/17 visit ***  Had another nice visit, but I should add that the Chicken Tortilla Soup is to be avoided.  In a word:  bland.  The wife said it tasted like cardboard.  If management reads this please fix this and let me know when you've done so.    The margaritas seem to have improved a bit.  I'll be back--just not having that soup again."}
{"text":"Nothing really special.  Luke warm greeting and half empty restaurant but was told we needed to wait for 10 minutes. Food was ok but not worth the high prices attached.  As we walked out neither hostess even looked up to say goodbye or thanks. Will drive the extra time to go to Old Mexico for better food at a reasonable price and better service."}
{"text":"Went there one night for dinner and drinks but they ran out of the whiskey we drink. Sort of disorganized at the bar. They served our main course first then came the appetizers. They apologized and took that off of our bill. Service was good. Food was above average. The best thing is the deck. I'm giving them a pass since they are still on their shakedown cruise."}
{"text":"We won't be back. For a table for 2 we were told there would be a 30-45 minute wait. Sure enough right before the 46th minute the pager went off. We asked to sit at a bar table and were told that was part of the wait list. 20 minutes pass before anyone was seated there and there were 5 empty tables the whole time we waited. We were also seated on the patio and not consulted if that was okay. It was 66 degrees, cold and the flaps were open. The hostess wasn't friendly. $4 for chips and salsa and they were all crumbs. We never got a refill and my taco salad was so watery that the plate was soaking wet."}
{"text":"OMG So wish I lived in Pittsburgh for this restaurant. All was incredible esp the barbacola (sp?) Burrito and the pineapple habanero salsa."}
{"text":"Today we got for lunch.. Street tacos, Taco Salad, Fajitas, Burritos, quesadilla and soup combo. The street tacos had so much shredded purple cabbage I asked for a different plate to scrap it all onto. Toppings not exciting and for $15 it was a total waste of money. The guacamole is not good there, it is $1.50 for a small 2 or 3 ounce side. This is not real Mexican. It looks nice and menu is large but the food is Americanized and not authentic by any means. Old Mexico, hands down, is the best Mexican around. I won't ever return. For 5 people for lunch it was $98 with tip $120 and I could have made tacos chips and homemade guacamole in my Vitamix for $35. Learning experience. Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I like the Mad Mex food and I like sitting at the bar when I eat...but the bar service is the absolute worst I have ever been to. Been there 5 times and it's always the same. Bartender is too busy talking to employees and male patrons to wait on customers in a timely and efficient manner. For that reason I shun away from going there. In fact the last time I was there...the Margherita machine was broken and oozing mix all over the floor, counter and into the serving ice storage bin. 4 employees were working to clean and totally ignored patrons."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Poor and very slow service. Not traditional Mexican food at all. Generic food for those with bar food taste. Margaritas certainly not worth the hype. Live near in Peters and we're hoping for more."}
{"text":"I would have given more stars but Tuesday nights service was annoying and rude, for all the restaurants patrons.  First, half of the outside seating was closed off due to it already being cleaned. This was at 8:45 and they do not close until 11:00. In my opinion if the restaurant is open all the seating should be available, especially the outside seating. Then in our outside seating area they started clean up at 9:30 moving all the chairs, cleaning under the tables, and the mood of our waitress turned to a hurry up offense. On my jaunt to the bathroom I noticed an employee napkin folding station setup next to patrons. These work tasks should be done out of the view of customers or after the restaurant closes, same with the major clean up. I am not talking about wiping down the table getting it ready for the next customer.  We really enjoy the black bean dip, barbacoa nachos and barbacoa quesidilla. I guess we will stick with going here during the lunch hour because clean up will start soon after."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and I tried this restaurant with my friend who also likes Mexican food.   I would say this place is a modern spin on traditional mexican food.   We both loved the fajitas and the Guacamole. It was fantastic.   I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Great location overlooking the world renowned Canonsburg Lake. The views are breathtaking and well worth the price of dinner.. said nobody .  Seriously it's a nice location and I had a peanut flavored topped burrito with chicken and the usual guts with a special requested corn stuffed into the fat, juicy wrap.  The cornbread is fabulous too but it's a side so shake your wife upside down and get that extra change. The salsa was tongue tickling but you will need lots of ice tea.  Give it a try and let me know what you think about it."}
{"text":"Always a good meal. I really enjoy getting burrito bowls. Less guilt. Got the carnitas burrito bowl. Great pork flavor.   Service was good quality."}
{"text":"I love Mad Mex, especially the Gobblerito. Chips and salsa are right on. Beer selection is top notch. Two things, though, that bother me. One, and this may be minute, the hostess staff REALLY need to work in the customer service thing. 80% of a dining service is based on the first ten minutes in the door. Ladies, smile, be polite, pretend you want to be there. Secondly, and more importantly, the margaritas. I can't speak for the whole chain, but the margaritas here, something is off. They literally all taste the same and bad. Possibly contaminants in the frozen machine or possibly lack of training in the making of a margarita  and for God sakes, serve them in a margarita glass, not a water glass.    Update since Mad Mex replied: I've had a selection of different margaritas from the house to the craft, all with the same bad outcome. If I were just being picky, that'd be one thing, but this is becoming the community 'expectation'. Gaining a bad reputation. I've been a Big Burrito fan for quite some time and this is disheartening."}
{"text":"Went there this past Saturday for a birthday celebration!  There was about 40 in our group.  Our waitress named Alicia Morris... she was fabulous... everyone in our group was so impressed in how awesome this waitress was!  She is up there with the top waitress ever!  Awesome place!  Thank you Alicia!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always a fantastic experience! The bartenders are personable and knowledgeable and make good recommendations. Most recently I was here and sat outside. I was first in a larger party. I was able to sit (didn't have to wait for the entire party like a lot of places) and enjoy myself while waiting. And the food was out of this world. The mango salsa was delicious!!!!!! And the crab quesadilla.. yum! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Mad Mex offers Great vegetarian & vegan options! Reasonably priced food, average happy hour, and I love eating on the deck."}
{"text":"Good but always packed. Food is alright and margaritas are mediocre. Not worth the wait, but still good."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa just ok :-(  Ordered shrimp and mushroom taquitos as appetizer, Im not sure what they served us not a taquito, they were more like burritos. My husband and I only ate one bite each.  Got the fries with queso too for our kids... queso was questionable.  We did really like the grilled steak and corn tacos we ordered!!! The tacos were only thing we enjoyed at dinner!"}
{"text":"This unique Mexican restaurant happens to be right across the road from The Little Lake Theater .  We have tickets for tonight's play, so are here first.  Loud music, crowds of customers, quick and friendly service as well as great food gives it a fun family oriented atmosphere.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"the food here is consistent and decent. I had the carnitas burrito and a couple of drafts. The portions border on the gigantic size if you like that. Varied tap and bottle selection. Service is attentive and the  interior has these great mexican cultural themed murals....I like them a lot. you can sit outside by a fire pit or on a \"porch\" that overlooks the lake. the bar is my favorite spot."}
{"text":"I went here each of the first three days they were open. Business was booming and parking was an issue. The service and food ,however, were great. So excited that this is finally open!"}
{"text":"Went to Mad Mex for the first time today. Our server was nice and the food could have been great, but everything was very bland. Like sprinkle salt on every bite bland. They were doing a special for 2 for $40. We decided not to do it because we didn't think we would want a margarita. My husband did end up getting a margarita so I asked if we could do the special and was told no that you had to decide that at the beginning. That's fine, but it was definitely a deciding factor for us to probably never go back. I can get bland food for way less money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Give it a try! You will be hard pressed to find an evening where it isn't crazy busy -- especially in the summer time. It isn't the most \"authentic\" Mexican I've ever had but it is delicious. The porch outside hosts such a fun, indoor/outdoor ambience that overlooks the lake. (Open in the winter too and heated) They also have a variety of porch games outside to play with like a giant Connect 4 and Jenga. Their margaritas are yummy for the price- especially during happy hour when you'll find them half off. Chips & salsa aren't free (which is a huge bummer) but I love their guacamole and they have a lot of options when it comes to salsa flavor. I'm a huge sucker for any of their quesadillas, I literally love them all!!! I all around enjoy the rustic, industrial, warm, indoor/outdoor vibe of this Mexican place by the lake."}
{"text":"I've eaten at various Mad Mex restaurants,  usually I have no issues with the food.  I ordered the fajita burrito with shrimp tonight and some one else in my group ordered a burrito with chicken. Both burritos were 85% rice and beans. I found a few pieces of what I guess was shrimp but was so overcooked and few  that I'm not sure. There were hardly and grilled fajita vegetables. Really disappointed and recommend not ordering a burrito which is strange as it's supposed to be one of their best dishes."}
{"text":"The food at Mad Mex is just \"alright.\" However, the margaritas are always good and the outside deck is so nice when sitting outside. It makes a great happy hour spot. Definitely NOT the best Mexican food in the area. But a great place to sit outside and have a drink!"}
{"text":"I do like the Mad Mex chain of restaurants but loathed having to drive up to the green tree location. This new location is, in my opinion, the best of the bunch.  Great seating and atmosphere.  Great \"outdoor/indoor\" seating. The food is always good, in the typical Mad Mex tradition.    Is this not exceptional, authentic Mexican like a Los Chilidos, but the food is very good and consistent.  They have a great beer list, like all mad mex locations.  However, this location has games (shuffleboard, foosball, giant jenga, giant checkers) outside while you wait or dine.    The view of the lake is very nice.  While many have struggled at this off-the-beaten-path location, Mad Mex is sure to prosper. The others that came before did little to embrace the location and had very poor decor.  We loved Table at first, but quality and cleanliness went downhill quickly.    Love having the best Mad Mex location right in our backyard!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped over here on the way to the city for dinner. Didn't know what to expect as the reviews are quite mixed.   The restaurant itself is really nice. It's got a cozy feel to it with a beautiful patio. Unfortunately the patio was closing when we got there but they managed to seat us right next to it.   We ordered the house margaritas which were fine. Nothing to write home about but not bad in any sense. Definitely should have asked for more tequila.   We decided to share the nachos. The plate was huge! We didn't manage to finish it between the three of us. But it was delicious with huge dollops of Guac, sour cream and salsa.   The mains are what really stood out though. The veggie tacos were delicious - very interesting fusion of Asian and Mexican cuisines with a punch. Healthy portions too!   The service was great. Our server had helpful recommendations and really made us feel at home.   I'd definitely come back when I'm in the area next! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this Mad Mex. great location, the food is always good - even as they were just starting up. The service is good and there is lots of seating. We go almost weekly. It can be busy, but what else would you expect?!? It's really an awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"Fun lively spot with flavorful food and a very good selection of IPAs that is constantly changing. Healthy food choices on the menu along side more traditional fair with a Mad Mex touch make this an excellent choice for all."}
{"text":"This place was great! We went on a Saturday a t 5 pm because we thought it would get packed and it did. So be mindful of when you go because it gets busy.  The food was really good. I was surprised  because I thought it would be just ok. Our server was really nice and came by often. The only thing I didn't like was the beer prices. The cheapest beer was Miller light and that was $4 a pop! The rest was between $5 - 9!!!   Anyways, solid 4 stars, will definitely be back again.  Edit: I will most certainly be back during happy hora, in fact as I'm typing this I'm here again!"}
{"text":"Obviously not authentic Mexican but still good. Usually get a burrito bowl. Love their baked corn on the cob in the fall. Also the gobbleritos are legendary. I wait all year for them. Last But not least- waffle fries with queso."}
{"text":"Awesome food, gigantic burritos, decent prices, great vibe and nice view. Plus, fun games on the deck."}
{"text":"Love this place. Probably my favorite Mexican restaurant. It's near my house. The Mad Mex Burrito is the best.  The last time they messed my order up. They gave me free chips and my meal on them and two free entrees for my next visit. I even tried to tip the guy and he refused.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food every time we come in. Nice patio deck that overlooks the lake."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I have been a fan of Mad Mex since its inception.  I have eaten at most every location in Western Pennsylvania, including Erie, and even State College. This was my first visit to \"Lakeside,\" and I must say I was completely blown away by the decorative efforts that make this place feel like the inside of a Dia De Los Muertas Holiday Greeting Card . . . Skeletons everywhere . . . I LOVE IT.  There are lots of skeletons in the other, newer Mad Mex locations too, but this one was the most excellent yet, including the skeletons in the Men's room (assuming the same for the Ladies too), and the bar area had the Mexican rendition of Tarot cards painted on the walls . . . Excellente!!  Now, however, the food.  I usually try and eat at least one \"Gobblerito\" each season, sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving.  It is a limited edition burrito stuffed with all the fixens' of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, and even has cranberries on the side.    When my burrito arrived, it didn't have that usual \"snappiness\" of a traditional Mad Mex burrito, it looked loose and flabby.  And when I tasted it, I almost felt like this turkey was left-over from last year's Thanksgiving feast.  It honestly didn't taste fresh, and unfortunately, I believe my burrito was prepared in a microwave, as the first bites were luke warm, but when I stuck a bite into my mouth from the center, it actually burnt the inside of my mouth so bad . . . I wanted to spit it out, but there was a table of women sitting right across from me, and I didn't want to ruin their meal by spitting out food across my table . . . so I held it in, and received third-degree burns in the roof of my mouth.  So glad I had ordered the frozen Pumpkin-Apple margarita (which was very tasty by the way) which helped to alleviate the pain, but sitting here writing this the next day, my mouth is still suffering and I can feel the skin molting inside my mouth.  Service was a bit slow, for my liking.  I had already known what I wanted to eat when I walked in the door, and I told the hostess I didn't need a menu, but she gave me one anyway.  My actual server took her time getting around to see me, and I was actually feeling a bit hangry when she finally did come over to take my order.   Thankfully the food arrived in a timely manner, but it is a shame that the food didn't meet my expectations.  Overall, I give this place a 5 for ambience, the decorations, and the wonderful view overlooking the lake, but I have to subtract points for the food, so I'm gonna split the difference and go 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out for Cinco di Mia knowing the restaurant would be packed. Loved the bean dip and our Mole and Chimichanga where hot and tasty, enough for us to finish the next night. Looking forward to our next visit to the restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really cool and has great food just the service is a little slow and seemed a little crazy and crowded"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in a long time ! I loved that they offered vegan options for me as a vegan that's a huge plus !!! Interior was nicely decorated it was packed . Our waitress wasn't very attentive imo she could have stopped at our table more than she did so we didn't constantly have to ask her for refills otherwise food was excellent . 4 stars only due to slacking waitress"}
{"text":"Always good and dependable Mexican food. Today I had the Barbacoa beef burrito. Very good, stuffed with rice, black beans, cheese, juicy and tender beef. Sided with salsa, sour cream and guacamole. Family had the chicken burrito, same as mine but with chicken. The Steak Fajita was enjoyed with sizzling steak, marinated with Mexican mustard slather, with grilled onions and peppers on the side. Make your own tortillas on the side with guac, salsa, sour cream and cheese. Mad Mex is a good Mexican eatery."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today. I have been to other Mad Mex's and this is definitely the nicest one. It sits riverside so there is a wonderful view. There is a nice patio that has a big shuffleboard game, Connect 4 game, as well as a very nice fire pit to hang out at. I will go back in the Spring and hang out since it will be warmer.  When you walk in there is a small room before you actually step into the restaurant. The walls are covered in small paintings that look like they were painted by children. Inside the restaurant, while still within the theme of the chain, seems a bit elevated in the interior design.  We ordered Mahi Mahi Tacos and a chicken burrito. We asked for a side of guacamole. It didn't take long for our food to come. It was all fresh and hot. As we were eating we both noticed something was a bit spicy. If you read my reviews you know I can't do spice. It seems that the guacamole was spicy. I was disappointed because it never has been before and it means I can't eat it.  The rest of the food was very tasty.  Our service was very good. Even as the restaurant filled the server kept checking on us. All in all it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Their crispy shrimp tacos with the mango tomatillo salsa is sooo good. It's new and you have to try it if you enjoy shrimp tacos"}
{"text":"We came late on a Thursday night and was shocked at how busy this place was! We've never been so I was very surprised and assumed this was a good sign. We ordered some chips and salsa for a starter. I really am not fond of Mexican places that don't just bring this to the table as your seated, I hate paying for it but my husband likes it so...I wasn't a fan personally of the salsa, it was fine but I prefer a chunky style salsa. The chips were seasoned well and I'm not exactly sure but it looks like they were warmed in an oven maybe because some of them were burnt around the edges. My entrée was the steak tacos. I ordered them cooked to medium and I have to say they were cooked perfectly and tasted great. The tacos were actually very good overall, just a little too much cilantro for me, but that was easily removed. The beans and rice on the platter though I could do without. The rice was basically tasteless and I prefer refried beans, these were not great. My husband went with the Super Mad Mex Burrito. It did not come with anything but a dollop of sour cream and little bit of salsa (same as the we just had with the chips). He ate all of it but it was not his favorite burrito I can tell you that. He told me that they are trying way to hard to be modern and should stick to the basics, no burrito needs to have chick pea chili and spinach :) They did not have a military discount, the waitress said they should so maybe management will consider this for future customers. No plans to return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a work day.   Good lunch menu with quick service.  Was in and out within an hour."}
{"text":"Nothing in 10 years has survived here, Big Burrito has the cash to keep it afloat, but at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon the restaurant was dead. On the good side, service was adequate and the selection was the same as all the rest of this local chain. Nothing to complain about If I lived here I would frequent this funky Amerixan theme restaurant."}
{"text":"Barely better than Taco bell. Save your money. Make your own or buy frozen American Mexican...it's about the same"}
{"text":"Mad Mex Lakeside just opened up in a location overlooking Canonsburg Lake.  Great place on the deck for a drink and a few apps.  Stopped in to try this location after golfing nearby.  Just like the other Mad Mex, The Big B group does a good job of having a funky place with some good fresh food with the Cal-Mex flavors."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to Peters Township! Same quality add other locations, great beer, great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Ok...well it started with walking in to a half empty restaurant and being told there is a wait to be seated. Scanning the menu, we ordered the pika dippa  with three salsa flavors. $9.50 and we got watery queso and some very bland salsa.. paired with the supermarket quality chips, and we are off to a rousing start.  When I asked if I could get a burrito without rice...the server said it would be tiny. Well one wouldn't think it hard to delete one component and still have a meal. I ended up with tacos, beans, and rice. As one reviewer said...Old Mexico has far better food and a reasonable price.  Pretentious atmosphere coupled with very mediocre Tex-Mex. The price paid far exceeded the quality and taste of the food. One visit and I doubt I shall go back. On leaving you normally get a greeting or a thank you...here we got disengaged hostesses busy texting.... I should have spent the extra 10 min, driven to and dined at Old Mexico...."}
{"text":"The food is always consistent which is why we love coming here, always a good go to for us. The view of the lake is nice but wait until it's warmer to sit on the deck (the so enclose at night and off seasons) for the best experience. Service varies, but overall we always have a nice meal."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I stopped in for a late lunch around 130pm on a Monday afternoon. The lunch crowd was gone by that time, but there were still patrons in the bar and restaurant areas.   The hostess (Skyler) was also our waitress. That might normally be weird, but it was the smaller post-lunch crowd and business was slow. She was hands-down the best part of our dining experience. And that's no detriment to the food!   Our food came hot, fast, and delicious. However, Skyler stole the show. She was knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and engaging. From seating us to taking our check, she made the entire experience worthwhile.   The ambience was good. The food was excellent. Service was outstanding.  Which reminds me.... I forgot my leftover fajita burrito with green sauce on the side in the car. BRB."}
{"text":"Josh was our server, he was great! He was super nice and answered annoying questions we had about the menu. He was quick and always kept our drinks full! The pick a dipa is the way to go! The quac is so creamy and yummy, xx queso is soooo good and spicy!!! Yum yum. Even on a Friday we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The view of the greenery and little lake is nice and makes dinner even better!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Wednesday night. Received great service. Had the chips and salsa and guac which I thought the guac was better than normal. Also had the spicy jalapeño margarita which was really good but definitely spicy!! My lips felt like they were on fire. I will surely return for food next time. Only suggestion would be to have more Mexican beers on draft...they only had Dos Equis amber."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go out in Peters hands down.   First, the ambiance is very cool! The restaurant overlooks Canonsburg Lake and in the summertime their patio windows open up and you can feel the breeze from the lake. Even sitting in the main area of the restaurant, it got a fun and southwestern feeling.   I LOVE their house Margaritas on the rocks with salt. So good! Their guacamole is also amazing but I really dislike their salsa selections.   I've had the California salad there with the grilled portobello and it's SO freaking good!   We've been there for lunch, dinner and late night and almost always have great service. There was one time we waited a half an hour for the check to come and then another half an hour for the guy to take it, but everyone has bad days. It's a great chill spot with good vibes close to home!"}
{"text":"Taste you can expect from any mad mex, plus all the awesome specials, along with a good outdoor seating area on the water. Overall very nice and accommodating, especially with my young son!!"}
{"text":"My family loved it. Great food and great service. Someone even stopped at my table to ask if I wanted more chips for my toddler to keep her busy. The wait was a little long early on a Saturday evening but it was well worth the wait. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"They should have five stars. They have the cutes decor, comfortable seating, and great food. Their seasonal crab dip is a must try!"}
{"text":"The first time we stopped at this location, the wait was an hour, so we left. The second time, we tried on a Wed and the wait was a half hour so we decided to wait. There is a nice view by the lake so I can see why it's a popular location. It ended up taking forty minutes just to get seated. Once we got seated it took ten minutes just to get noticed and then an even longer time to get our food. As our waitress was very nice and seemed like she was waiting on ten tables just by herself, we unfortunately had to wait for our food over forty five minutes. The only thing that came out fast was our appetizer. The meals took entirely too long and tasted just okay. I was happy I could use my free birthday burrito coupon, but other than that I sadly do not feel as if we will be returning to this location."}
