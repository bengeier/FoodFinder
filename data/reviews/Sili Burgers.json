{"text":"Yeah, this place is terrible.  I hope they close down so that a more worthy restaurant can take their place.  To start, they had only 2 people working during the busy lunch rush.  As a result, I waited over 45 min for my burger and fries!  I didn't realize until after I had ordered just how many people were sitting around the restaurant without food.  The place was packed, but only 3 or 4 tables were actually eating, the rest were waiting.  When I finally got my food I had to rush back to work, so I took the food to go rather than eat there.  As I walked back to work, the anticipation grew.  Surely, if so many people were willing to wait that long for their food, it must be worth it?  Yeah, no, my burger tasted like bitter disappointment.  The fries managed to be overdone and soggy at the same time.  That is quite a feat.  I do not think I will ever return here."}
{"text":"1 star for Alberta beef.  1 choice for the checklist to choose your toppings.   Burger came out just average   Fries were nothing special.  Go to south street burger company instead of this place.  Or McDonald's"}
{"text":"I'm always a little forgiving of new restaurants, especially if they're trying to buck the traditional ways of doing things. In this case, however, I feel previous reviews were not fair whatsoever as I had a far more positive experience.  Let's start with image. Simple yet effective is how I'd describe it. When you walk in you aren't inundated with a bunch of ridiculous fluff. You grab a clipboard with a checklist for toppings.This place is about burgers, that's it.   Although at first I was a little concerned that a burger could cost $10 with no extra cost toppings, but then when I was told that each of their patties was 1/3 of a pound meaning the $10 was a full pound, I was completely satisfied with the price (they do have single and double patty offerings for less price).  As for the burger, it must have been a vegetarian who gave it 1 star for Alberta beef. Unlike cardboard offerings at McDonalds or grease traps at 5 Guys, I found the burger to be super tasty and juicy. The fact that I had complete control over my toppings was a plus. The fries were decent as well. They wouldn't steal the show from the burger and are a nice compliment.  I can't comment on the frozen yogurt as I never tried it, but that alone is a selling feature that will bring me back later. As for the other reviews, I would completely ignore them and try this place out for yourself. It may not be the best burger you've ever had, but it's definitely decent and not a waste of money."}
{"text":"For a place that only sells burgers, I would expect more. I ordered a single patty burger with bacon, but the bacon was undercooked and tasteless, I could hardly tell it was even on the burger. The burger itself was dry, thin and bland, probably one of the worst burgers I've ever eaten. While the veggies were fresh, the cheese was processed and dry, the kind of cheese I'd expect from Mcdonalds rather than from a specialty burger joint. The fries, while ample in quantity, were dry and overseasoned, and cold by the time I got home. All in all, overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"You know what's silly about this place? Spending your money here. I hate to do this being the first one to review, but the food here was very underwhelming.  Upon first walking in I was impressed. The decor looked nice, it was modern, and had your typical new burger place feel. Upon further inspection it seems like they ran out of money in their budget at the end. There is a large logo on the wall that is rippled and looks like it was installed by someone that didn't know what they were doing. The menu boards look like they were designed for the size of a postcard, then blown up to fit the menu board.   So how this place works if that you grab a clipboard from the side and check off what you want. However, not everything they offer is on the paper, like the poutine. After placing my order and paying I was directed to grab a seat and they would bring it out to me when it was ready.  After a short wait, they brought out my double bacon cheese burger and poutine. The burger looked quite delicious. It was a massive stack of meat, cheese, and toppings. Unfortunately my first few bites quickly changed that. The meat was really greasy and caused the bun to fall apart in my hands making for a big mess. Also, the meat seems to be processed patties which I wouldn't expect for the price I was paying. As I was eating my burger I remembered that I payed extra for bacon. Where was it? Why couldn't I taste it? This is because the bacon is paper thin and the strips are so narrow that they get lost and you can't even tell they're on the burger. Overall I'd probably give this burger three stars. Its overpriced for what it is, but its slightly better than any big chain fast food burger.  Onto the poutine. Absolutely terrible. This is easily the worst poutine I've eaten. The fries were soggy, like they either weren't fresh or the oil wasn't hot enough when they cooked them. The soggy fries were drowning in gravy. And I mean drowning. It was like a soup. The dish came with onions an mushrooms on top also. The onions were such huge pieces all you could taste was onion. Actually, that's not true, there was also a burnt flavour that was quite strong. Maybe it was from the mushrooms. I think there was cheese on this but its hard to say. There was a remnant of a piece of cheese in the gravy. I think that they use cheese slices so the cheese just melts away into nothing.  Hidden away in the corner are frozen yogurt machines. Except for on the sign outside, there is almost no way to know that they even have froyo. Its not on the menu boards nor is there any signage inside the store to direct you over to that offering."}
