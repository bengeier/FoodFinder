{"text":"Had to wait over an hour for food to go. Customers with reservations having to wait an hour over as well. Understaffed with employees complaining loudly. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"for Joni !! She is an absolute delight. Rae's is a favorite go to breakfast location of mine and Joni is a major reason why. She is always friendly, and personable, helping many customers with ease....and humor.  Joni is such an asset to Rae's.....a great compliment to to the excellent food."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Rae's for several years and never thought about writing a review. Dumb! I go there for lunch regularly with a disabled relative who always leaves happy and full. Recently, I have been meeting 3 cranky Republicans there for breakfast. They also leave happy and full that alone should be worth 5 stars!
The server, Joanie (hope I spelled that right) is the true gem at this place. The food is great but really 4 star rating. Joanie, however, kicks the score up to 6 but 5 is the highest I can go."}
{"text":"Well, I came here with my grandparents. My grandpa and I had already eaten and we were picking my grandma up from the hotel she was at. She wanted something to eat so we stopped here. As soon as we walked in, the first thing we noticed was that there was no one at the counter. There was another lady in front of us too that was waiting to be seated. The sign they have clearly states \"Hostess will seat you.\" Well we waited about 8 minutes. The lady in front of us left. There was a customer in the dining area who noticed us and notified the waitress. Her name was Joni. Then we got seated.

We ordered our drinks and my grandma placed her order: prime rib sandwich with a side of coleslaw and onion rings as an appetizer for all of us to share. Joni brought out the onion rings out right away. They were very tasty, I would definitely say. Joni was also quick with the refills on our drinks.

When my grandma's order came, she was a bit disappointed. The menu never specified how big the cut of prime rib was. It barely bit on the bread. She ate it anyway, and got a to-go box. The menu should specify how big it is though. Food was good otherwise.

The restaurant wasn't that busy. The section we were in had at least 4 tables taken (counting ours) out of the 20 in the room. Joni was the only one running this section. She had to cover all 4 tables. Not only that -- she had to cover the front counter as well! Honestly, I felt bad for her. She was a really nice waitress and was a hard worker it seemed. 

Goodness though Rae's, get more staff! Don't make one person do all the work!"}
{"text":"Ok...Generally, I'm not one to toot horns for a restaurant...good or bad...However, as one of the first customers to frequent Rae's, going back to 1993...I feel somewhat compelled to set the record straight. 

Being in a commercial strip center, from the outside, it may look like any one of a hundred Bar & Grills in the area, but step inside and you realize this is one nice Restaurant-Lounge. I've always appreciated the fact that the restaurant and lounge area are totally separate, a real plus when you gotta bring the kids along. The decor is tasteful, intimate, and relaxed with cozy booths for the most part plus huge aquariums that set off the restaurant and lounge areas, which I find quite relaxing while dining... and neat for the kids too! 

Has the restaurant had its ups n' downs? Sure... What restaurant hasn't in this economy? But, the one thing that has kept me (and my family)coming back time and again, year after year, is the consistently good, fine food and friendly service... 

The same beer-battered Fish N' Chips I fell in love with back in '93 is still there today...and as tasty as ever. Personally, I'm not big too big on seafood, but my wife raves about the Tilapia, from the Early Bird Dinner menu...As a beef and potatoes guy, my favorites are the Prime Rib and Filet Mignon which I believe rank as good , if not better, than any of the other \"fine dining\" restaurants charging so much more.

Speaking about price, I don't know of too many other sit down family restaurants, where you can get a N.Y. Steak & Eggs breakfast for only $5.95 or complete dinners for as little as $8.95. 

Last year we had a 25th Wedding Anniversary dinner party for about 40 in their private dining banquet room that was just about perfect from start to finish...and, they even waived the usual room charge for the banquet which made it even sweeter. 

Am I a fan of Rae's?...You Bet!..."}
{"text":"After being in Las Vegas for 1 year My fiance and I decided to try Raes.  We don't even call it Raes anymore we call it Our Bar.  I definitely wish we would have dropped in earlier.  The bartender Patti could very well be the greatest bartender ever.  The food is great and the machines play fair.  My fiance hit two royals this year. And my favorite game 4 card keno has been pretty kind as well.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've been eating there for over six years. When I first walked in, I was really glad to find that the seating was very comfortable. Couldn't help but notice that the waitress joni was very pro & attentive - definitely, one of the best waitresses I have ever run into. One of my favorite things is their Steak and Egg breakfast. The steak is really good quality. I once tried the fried 1/2 chicken at lunch and It was really tasty, full of flavor. Dinner was really great too, I went on a night they had prime rib. It was excellent. When at the bar, I decided to try their basic hamburger and it was large, with veggies, really tasty - reasonably priced. Also, noticed that besides they serve cocktails, they are also open 24 hours. Recently, they're serving breakfast till 3pm which is a really convenient for me, as sometimes, I have to eat a late breakfast. I've tried quite a few places in town and this one is well worth it."}
{"text":"The prime rib was so small that is wasnt worthy of a sandwich slice let alone a main protein on the plate.  The rice had such hard pieces in it that I almost chipped a tooth.  Have been good customers for 3 years but we sadly will not be back again....."}
{"text":"I came to eat with a friend and unfortunately this place wasn't for me.... not really my kind of food. I tried the steak it was a little too bloody and I asked for it medium well done... but my friends love this place"}
{"text":"So verry disappoint.  The food was just no good. Been going for years and loved it. But the last 2 times have be awful.  Tonite I got a raw steak when I asked for well done, cold baked potato and the waitress didn't seem to care. I guess I'll take them off my list of good food. They lost there touch."}
{"text":"Shurie was my very friendly bartender.  I was craving soup since I'm a bit under the weather.  My first time in Rae's & it was very clean.  

Under Chicken Noodle Soup, there is an asterisk as a 'favorite' so I was like yay.  Not so yay.  It was bland which I think is tough to make Chicken Noodle soup taste totally sodium-free.  Also it was full of celery.  Yuck!  The Chardonnay was $10, no worry if it's good, but wow it was not good.  I ordered the $11 wine, but my check said $10 so not sure what kind it was now.  

The breakfast menu portion looked good and there were regulars, however, if that's a 'favorite' and you mess it up, then I wonder about the rest of their food. The stars are only for the bartender being nice and quick.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Everything is always delicious!! I have never had a bad meal here!! I usually get the reas cut of prime rib and it's always amazing."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there for lunch today. When we walked in it  looked  nice enough . We asked the waitress if the food was good and she said that it was. I ordered the fried chicken at her recommendation and my girlfriend ordered a hamburger patty and french fries. The hamburger came out medium well even though she ordered it medium. I ordered the fried chicken which came out very crispy and very dry. So all in all we were very disappointed. The high point was the french fries, they were great as was the coleslaw. We probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Country fried steak is good here very good very friendly and polite in professional waitress"}
{"text":"Too bad we don't live in Henderson anymore! Raes was our spot to drink reasonably priced good drinking wine and of course brunch! Their steak and eggs and corned beef hash are my fave. Decent prices and good food"}
{"text":"Go here often, went there on Thursday wanted to play the machine, have a drink and eat some dinner, so order a drink and my dear friend was with me and he ordered water and lemon. I asked him to ask the bartender for a menu while I went to the ATM to get Cash to play the machine.when I came back he told 
 that the bartender told him that she was attending bar if you want food go to the restaurant , my friend is 87 Year's old was so surprised that she would be so disrespectful  at that point I told him let's go else where and left. This is not the first time this has happened to me from the same skinny lady with the long blonde hair. I like there food and it's close to home but will never go there again. Many of people that I know that have gone there said the bartenders are the rudest ever! If you don't want to serve food at the bar then don't advertise it!!! Rude and lazy bartender!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent service, decent food.  Just the right amount of food.  Didn't care for the coleslaw though.  A little bland."}
{"text":"I started going to Rae's over 22 years ago. It is one of my favorite places for breakfast and dinner. The food is great, and not to mention prices are very reasonable.  

The owner, Joan,  Had a very nice buffet for Mother's day. It was outstanding. My compliments to Joan and the chef. 

The atmosphere inside Rae's reminds me back in the days of watching old classic movie's (40's and 50's) of Frank Sinatra, with my mother. It is warm and relaxing. As your sitting in one of their comfortable round high back booth's as your watching fish, and enjoying one of your favorite cocktails or coffee. 

In the mornings my waitress, Joanie, is sweetie. She's always smiling and the great service she provides. If Joanie, happens to see me walking in, she always has my coffee waiting. Thank you!! Joanie.  

Let's not forget the bar tenders!! 
It speaks for itself. Since I been going to Rae's over 22 years now, my favorite bartender is still there. With her witty personality. I love them all. They always make sure you're taken care of.. Cheer's to them.. 
 
Merry Christmas & Happy New Year 2018, to Joan and her staff.
\"Thank you\" for your outstanding service's that you provide for us.

See you soon on my next visit."}
{"text":"I love this place I have been going forever to occasionally grab food but the lady sitting at the table eyeing you coming in is not so cool even though the food is great its the only place I constantly get chicken fingers with ranch and a side of the hot sauce even though I am an adult!!! But the comments about the owner seem accurate as well as the service so I must love the nostalgia it gives me but I still come to this places pence in awhile but for the same price there are definitely funner places with at least equal food and better service and no old lady eyeing you up and down when you walk in!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, quick service. Cleanliness was less than perfect, but far from disgusting. Prices were reasonable, especially for breakfast for two. I would highly recommend this place for a date or a small group."}
{"text":"Raes is in a class of its own!  Outstandingly. Food! Great prices!  But why is this place always empty? I'll tell ya why. They always have one server working her ass off while the owner is sitting in her ass as you enter! ? As a corporate manager in the food business industry! It's a big downfall in the business! Get it together or you'll be shutting your doors for good!"}
{"text":"What can one say...
Been going here for YEARS ...Reasons:
Robin the bartender (all are good, but she really makes it feel like your the only one there)
The FOOD!:  off the HOOK...  Really for a Bar - your never think FOOD could be this good in a BAR environment.  Things are made with CARE and THOUGH - by a CHEF I presume (or my mom is moonlighting).  Imagine THAT!
Games:  OK...first place I have ever hit 10k before or after RAE'S.  And I've done it more than once there... Just sayn. No haters!  Come n hit for yourself.  One of the few places that has the step up payoffs on jackpots!!! Pay 10 coins and get EXTRA!!!!
Did I mention Robin?  One of the best tenders in the biz... Either she's a great actress (academy awards?) or she's the real deal... Yep. The real deal...
Don't walk but run if you want GREAT SERVICE-EXCEPTIONAL FOOD-and some extra duckets in you pockets!
I'm a FAN!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large soup to go.  They gave me a small 12oz container (same size as a can of soda) that they said was a \"bowl\", charged $5.68.  For you math types that's $60.58 a gallon.  I understand that this is a business but what a ripoff."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The staff is so friendly and the food is delicious!  We take our family here every chance we get."}
{"text":"We we're very disappointed St. Patrick's Day. The one day they make corn beef. We ordered the Milehigh pastrami on rye and it was more like an eighth of a mile high and dry. Last year was great and it was like a Milehigh, oh what a difference a year can make."}
{"text":"Rae's takes way to long to get there food to the table. The owner and waitress where very nice but we waited an hour for our food to get to are table this is not a place for a quick lunch at all"}
{"text":"This place is gross.. And far from clean do NOT eat here. As far as the service goes.. if your not gambling, your treated very bad."}
{"text":"Stay away unless you are 87 years old or you enjoy awful food."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fingers meal just mild and it came out super spicy as well as a ceasar salad (overdressed). The bartender was rude and needs to smile more. She was more interested in serving the regular customers who were gambling."}
{"text":"We live right down the street from here and this is our first time stopping by. I really wish that we had come sooner. So welcoming when you walk in. Home like feel and a full menu. I had the chicken piccata which I highly recommend. Hubby had prime rib- he loved it.  My 3 year old had the kids chicken fingers and fries. It was big enough for an adult btw;) Robin sold us though. She made it feel like a B & B, like we were family. She took our little guy to see the fish and gave him an ice cream sundae:) we will be back."}
{"text":"Worst Thanksgiving meal ever. They used a turkey roll instead of real turkey. Everything was covered in the gravy which had so much salt ,inedible. Pumpkin pie was barely defrosted, service was good but I felt ripped off for such poor food.Yuk!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good BAR food and great service. Just been here for lunch a few times and orders to go like my order today (Rae's breakfast and for my lunch/dinner ck Cesar salad). This is a local spot, perfect for locals, meeting for a few beers and burgers or breakfast after a long night of fun. My lunch favorites are the grilled chicken Cesar salad and the chicken Cobb. The bar is clean, old school which I love and reasonably priced. The service is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Can always count on a great meal here, have been a frequent for years. Close to home for us, great food and great service. This place is a great hidden find. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Raes food and service are awful. I have gone there since 1995 and it's gone downhill. The owner is a very mean and nasty old lady. Food quality and value are poor!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, food and prices. Thoroughly enjoyed our most recent visit. Have been there before and will certainly return. From hostess to server to barkeep, kudos everyone."}
{"text":"I don't think the servers could have been any grumpier or rude. Ruined the whole experience. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you are from \"back east\" you should feel right at home playing slots in the dark at this dump. The food is average. Two out of the three barmaids I've encountered here were hard core feminists. Since I was raised to; \"don't say anything if you cant say anything nice\", I am done."}
{"text":"Wish I had something positive to say. The bartender was so rude! Don't waste your time. We we will never go back..."}
{"text":"Hard to even give two stars. Place is dirty, choices are limited and food is just ok. Don't order a soda - either their machine and lines are filled with gunk or they just don't know how to dial it in but it tastes awful."}
{"text":"Absolutely rude & horrible . My husband & I went in on a recommendation from a friend about the delicious ribs . We walk in and no ones around to seat us the bar area is open many people in there drinking, gambling & smoking . The small dining room to the right had 1 person in it at a booth still no one around finally someone comes out of this door to the left and says dining room is closed not hello how are you what can we do for you tonight but the dining room is closed . Okay can we eat in the bar area? Ohh yeah the hostess ( I think) says so my husband Jeff goes into the bar in lagging a  bit behind as I walk into the bar area I hear Jeff say forget it forget it , I say what ? Bartender tells him we can eat in there if we're gambling sarcastically rude tone. So here we are 2 people that had planned on eating drinking and gambling after we ate standing there speechless The hostess not much nicer as I walked out to her she said yeah if your eating at the bar where the machines are you have to gamble , I was absolutely thrown let me get this straight, if I'm  not gambling at the moment I'm eating I CANT eat ? WTH Sorry not sorry but even if We weren't gambling at all not having a drink we're basically not allowed to be there , because what they are saying everyone is if your at the bar and you kinda have to be at the bar, there is NO tables & chairs then you can't be there . That is what we were told find a spot with no machines which was close to nothing and no chairs anyway. So this is it you can't go to Rae's and eat when the dining room is closed without gambling even if your drinking you can't sit at the bar the only seats in the place to begin with . Save yourselves don't go there"}
{"text":"This place is alway consistently good. The servers are always nice, drinks are served cold and fast and the food is great! Extremely reasonable prices for great food!

We come for breakfast all the time and their corned beef hash is amazing but their prime rib is really what I usually come for.

They have an early dinner special for the prime rib from 4-7pm for $15, thick cut. After that it is $17.95 for a 12oz cut. The meat is so tender and piping hot.  You get a choice of soup or salad and they have made-from-scratch chicken noodle soup that is hearty and perfectly seasoned. The prime rib is alway so tender and the mashed potatoes were so good!

This is a nice family owed business. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch the steak and eggs is the bomb."}
{"text":"I stopped in here around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. It was recommended by a friend's dad, who said they had a great prime rib sandwich.

When you walk in the door there is a small dining room area off to the right, and then the gaming bar to the left. It's kind of dark in there. Big U shaped gaming bar. It wasn't very crowded while I was there, maybe 5-6 other patrons.

I ordered the prime rib sandwich, and it came out with a side of cole slaw and a mistaken side of fries. Bonus!!! It's corn fed prime rib so it was pretty flavorful, just a tad overcooked for me (I like it rare to medium rare). Served on a sourdough bread that is soaked in au jus, the flavors were really good together and I wolfed it down like Leonardo Di Caprio eating raw deer liver in Revenance. 
The cole slaw was really good too, a little creamy like I like it. Grand total of $11 and change including my ice tea drink. Well worth the money!

I would definitely come back and try a few other menu items that looked good. Service was quick and friendly. Just a cool little neighborhood bar located on Wigwam and Pecos."}
{"text":"You know, I'm surprised over these other reviews.

Sure the layout is bit awkward, the lighting is always a tad bad, and the negotiations needed to grab a table is a bit disappointing, but I do love me some Rae's.

First off, it's a Bar and Grill.  And it's always pretty empty when I'm there.  The owner/lady is always sitting in the same booth going over whatever owners/ladies do in a restaurant.  I don't know if it's unprofessional, but it is a little poor in taste seeing her on a phone with stacks of paperwork in front of her - and it's one of the first things I saw.

I've frequented this place dozens of times because the food, despite the fact that it's a Bar and Grill, is severely underrated.  I've had the chicken fingers, the taco salad, the tuna melt, the hamburger (with bleu cheese crumbles is the way to go), the fish and chips, and prime rib:  all are very good.  All are well flavored.  Put it this way: I've never had something here I didn't like a lot.

Speed of service isn't terrible, but it can work in your favor if you have nowhere to be.  A gripe here is the cups.  They are so small (12 ounces-ish) that I feel like I'm at the kid's table.  Wouldn't be a problem if A) I wasn't thirsty ever again or B) the waitress was more attentive.

All of this to say:  Is it my favorite place?  No.  Would I want to frequent it every day?  No.  But based on how close I do work to Rae's, it's not bad.  And I usually leave there (despite the atmosphere and mediocre service) pretty satisfied.  Try it out?  Could be good."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to whenever I eat breakfast. The food is good and reasonably priced, table and floor are clean and the servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"Shiurie, the day shift bartender tues-fri, lights up this dark bar. She's always moving, always smiling and always making people's day. The food is consistently good and their French onion soup is salty and cheesy in the most perfect way.
The salads are big and filling and the veggie omelette is my go-to breakfast. Stop in sometime for breakfast or lunch and leave happier!"}
{"text":"The food was never spectacular and the service is appalling. I was wanting to play a machine that no one was on and the manager told me that it was \"reserved for real players, not people who play coins\". I have come here twice before and dealt with this ornery bartender/manager before and her behavior was conducive of this \"your money isn't worth it\" attitude despite playing between $20 and $100 at a time, and ordering food by her suggestions. Don't waste your time or money on this grungy, crass, hole-in-the-wall. Pts downs the street will at least treat u with respect."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood bar.  They used to have an excellent prime rib.  They had good prices on the early bird menu.  Over time the price has gone up and sadly the quality has gone down.  They still have excellent french onion soup, great baked potatoes, nice dinner salad.  Sad to see the changes in quality.  It is still a comfortable spot to sit and chat.  Also used to be good for holiday meals but that too seems to need an update."}
