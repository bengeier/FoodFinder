{"text":"This gallery is horrible. I was genuinely suprised when I found out they had moved rather than shuttered their doors forever.

I, along with a number of my peers had a really horrible renting experience almost two years ago now. Like many ocad fourth year groups NOT in the sculpture major, we barely heard back from any galleries willing to rent to us. Norman Felix charged us a lot for one week, the price given to us being their \"discount\" rate for students. A seemingly added bonus was the on-site bar that allowed us to not get a special occasion permit. I'll start with the bar- the owner (tall blonde woman obsessed with herself and her instagram persona) changed the prices the night of our opening. We saw prices before hand and they had been raised a few dollars. Our \"special cocktail\" was hideously over priced. Like 12$ for some drink her stoned bar tender made. The owner assumed that since we were a student group we wouldn't have a good turnout and didn't have the proper permit for our opening,  so we had to pretend we had a guest list and were checking people off and using a clicker to 'count' attendees ( my fake Facebook profile which I have rsvp'd as a joke somehow attended somehow without me knowing) AND THEY RAN OUT OF BOOZE. These were a few complaints for the night of opening.

Other problems were related to our installation day, artwork which we had been told would be taken down had been left up, UGLY STUFF. Then there is her permanent collection which we knew about, but man it really clashes with current art school stuff. Her massive jewelry display cases had to be forced into other rooms so we could use the space we paid for. She was huffy throughout the entire thing. Her staff aka stoned guy was unhelpful. Basically we got there and shit we were told would be done had not been done!

The biggest kicker is we paid for a week (or 5 business days)  and the gallery was open 1.5 days. Her claim was her dog was sick?!?!? Days we were told she would be open she didn't bother to go in. We also booked a day to go in as a class and do our final crits, and she showed up an hour late to open the space for us. Very unprofessional. She was obviously mad that we had forced her out of bed and while we tried to have quiet discussions about our work, she blasted music over the building speaker system.  

Overall a bad experience,  10/10 would not recommend,  and would give this place a zero if I could. Owner is a selfish crook and unprofessional. Only upside is her dog is cute?"}
{"text":"They always have cool student art events here. It's a very nice gallery with 3 levels, wish there was a way to keep track of what's happening here."}
{"text":"If you are a student or curator I would not recommend this gallery as a rental space. Had a pretty crummy experience putting on a student exhibition with some peers in my 4th year of OCADU. 

For the large amount of money you put down to rent the space for a week, you get walls. Nothing else. Zilch. 

The install was a nightmare because the gallery uses a hook and chain system for hanging, and did not have enough chains for the work, and those they did have where uneven and made it impossible to get the paintings level. The staff were extremely unhelpful and rude during the whole process. They also refused to let us put a work in the window of the space for the opening (the space we paid to rent) and left out a bunch of merchandise for sale in the window and gallery space. 

I'm not sure if this place is even in business anymore but I would recommend going anywhere else if they still are."}
