{"text":"Go just to see the interior of this place.  Really nice.  They have good drink specials.  The chimichangas were solid but not extraordinary.  The ingredients were fresh.  Chips and salsa were good too.  Nice addition to the Washington Road stretch of Mt. Lebo."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had!  Great service and friendly staff.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fernando said he'd take care of us and he delivered.  Food was excellent, and the service just as good. Queso dip was fresh and yummy and the enchiladas were authentic. Too bad I don't have room for dessert"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunches very much, however, the constant hovering of the female manager bossing our server around made us very uncomfortable. It was not pleasant when the server was so friendly and they were not busy. Nothing was being taken away from any of the other customers."}
{"text":"This is hands-down, the best new place in the burgh! It's the best Mexican you will find anywhere! The guacamole is made fresh at your table, and it is absolutely delicious!! Perfect guacamole. The staff is friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is top-notch. The bar is beautiful. The food is absolutely delicious. The best margaritas and polomas! I can't say enough of how great this place is. Finally, a great Mexican place in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great food and a fun atmosphere. The dining rooms are  little crowded, but that is the only mark against it. I went with a group of friends for dinner and drinks. We had a great time and everyone enjoyed their food. The mojitos are delicious.  The setting is casual, and very relaxed."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, the food is good. (I'm a vegetarian, so I've only tried a few things, but the enchilada rojo with cheese is awesome.)  and the best part is how lovely the staff are.  I also get excited for any chance to practice my Spanish."}
{"text":"The food is good, servers are friendly providing excellent table/bar service.  The folks at Totopo routinely expand menu ideas and techniques (e.g., table-side preparations of Choriqueso and Guacamole, fresh hot-off-the-reel tortillas, new drinks). For regulars (like us), they know your name, your preferences, and before we can take a seat at the bar, a drink is already in hand.  The environment is festive, occasionally joined by a mariachi band, seasonal themes like Dia de Los Muertos.  Very fun place."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this new Mexican Restaurant, in the old Walnut Grill location. Start you out with the chips and salsa. I had the combo (pick 2 and 2 sides for $10.00). Had the chicken taco and chicken burrito. Had the salad and the rice as the sides. The salad was great, not sure what kind of dressing, but it was great. Service was good, host was pleasant. Nice bar area. Good overall experience, reasonably priced, good food. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and will certainly recommend it to discerning eaters who really appreciate better mexican food.  I had a chicken/ chorizo burrito that was a healthy portion and grilled just right. The guacamole was probably the best I have eaten in pittsburgh thus far so I would recommend getting the chips and guac for anyone. Beer selection was so so and server wasnt that thrilled to serve us though dont let that turn you away from this really good restaurant in mt lebo."}
{"text":"Just ok.....the service is abysmal and the wait staff seem to not know anything about the menu.  Guacamole made at the table was good and fresh. Salsa was average. Hubby's burrito was average as were the chicken fajitas.  Not that the kids menu matters to most, but it was disappointing that the chicken fingers and fries were clearly the cheapest frozen kind one can purchase.  The place is sort of confusing as it was touted as being \"authentic\" Mexican but to me seemed very Americanized. I was hoping for something more along the lines of La Palapa in the South Side which to me is one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in Pgh."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Sunday to check out the new Totopo restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. Overall, we had a really enjoyable experience and we thought the food was delicious and in a very reasonable price range when comparing it to other establishments.  Our wait time was only 15 minutes to be seated, we were immediately given chips and salsa. As a matter of fact a woman was walking around constantly to make sure each guest table had fresh chips and salsa. The salsa was delicious. The chips and salsa were definitely freshly homemade.  We ordered several margaritas and we thought they were very good. They seemed strong but I don't think they were as strong as other establishments.  We ordered the dip sampler. The queso was fantastic and the chunky salsa and guacamole were very good.  We also ordered the enchilada, burrito and fajita  quesadilla and all were supremely good and tasted very authentic. The portions were not very large though, but priced well.  Overall we thought the food was excellent, the service not bad for being new, and the pricing to be reasonable. We would certainly recommend that you try it out. We're glad to have another new restaurant in our Mt. Lebanon community."}
{"text":"Guacamole was great.... That's the one star. Rest of the food was blah! Service was HORRIBLE. Dinner took three hours."}
{"text":"Excellent place!! I am from Mexico City and the food here is very traditional and delicious ! The people is very friendly and fast service. Don't forget to order some margaritas !"}
{"text":"We visited ToTopo for the first time after living down the road for almost a year.  It was fantastic!  I am not sure if we had a first timer vibe, it was my ready to pop pregnant belly, or just a really nice manger but he gave us table side made guacamole on the house.  It was delish and fun to watch it be made.   For the gluten free among us it was easy to find options.  The quesadilla was good but the chicken chorizo tacos were unbelievable! One person tried the margarita and said it was wonderful!  I am excited to go back after baby and try one.  Weekdays 4-6 the are half off!  So are appetizers and beer is a dollar off.   The service was good.  Some of the servers were hard to hear as the talked quietly.  They were on top of checking on us as refilled waters frequently.  The environment was friendly, and inviting.  We'll care for live plants made the place feel homey and natural.  As far as we could see it was spotlessly clean.  I wish I checked the bathroom but as we live around the corner it did not occur to any of us to scope it out."}
{"text":"We dined at a moderately busy time and the service marginal. It would not be unreasonable to expect better, faster, more accurate service when the place isn't slammed busy. Food was \"vanilla,\" orders had missing sides, and the check was not split correctly.   In terms of food quality, there are other Mexican food places nearby that are FAR superior. The hard shell chicken taco I ordered arrived as beef. Fine, sometimes there are mistakes, and I can understand that. But the beef was similar to taco bell quality and tasted burnt. I will say that the taco was still crunchy so at least it was fresh and hadn't sat out very long.   The mojito I ordered was also generic at best. It arrived in a regular beer glass and had three pieces of mint, too much ice and the flavor was bland. If you're  charging premium prices for cocktails, they ought to be premium quality.   Finally, the table side guacamole is delicious and there is enough for 4. Although a bit of a gimmic, this is the only thing I would order again. Offering something other than chips to go along with it would take this app to the next level.    Overall, this location is cursed, as the previous \"grill\" did not last long and I can't say that I have faith this place will either. If you're looking for cheap beer and apps this is the place to be. If your looking for a quality TexMex entree, head down the street a bit further."}
{"text":"I think this may be the best Mexican food I've had in my entire life. The tableside-made guacamole is absolutely to die for, and I loved the cilantro lime chicken tacos so much the first time I came here that I'll never order anything else! We've also never had a wait for a table, even on a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here on a Friday evening.  It was very busy but thankfully we had reservations.   I ordered the shrimp fajitas and the house Margarita.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the Margarita was perfect as well!  Reasonably priced.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal and customer service. Best Mexican I have had in a long time! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"4-Rating for Pittsburgh, may be in the top 3 in the area but not in the same league as Mexican restaurants in other states such as Texas and California.  Nice atmosphere and good service.  The fajita meat is not that great, you may opt for carne asada and make your own tacos.  El pastor is decent and the choriqueso pretty good."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I had the Chicken Chorizo tacos that came with rice and refried beans. My companion had a combo meal and ordered a taco and an enchilada, came with 2 sides and we shared the dip sampler. Guacamole had excellent texture and flavor, queso was creamy with just a hint of heat. I will be back. Complimentary chips and salsa when you're seated!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the garden salad with cilantro lime dressing. The greens were cool and crisp, and the dressing was tasty! The skinny tacos were nicely presented and the ingredients were fresh, especially the avocado. My dining friend had stuffed poblano pepper which she said was delicious with just the right amount of spiciness for her (she likes spicy). Service was excellent considering the busy lunch crowd."}
{"text":"When you start out with salsa as amazing as they have, you know it can only get better! Friendly wait staff and super tasty food. After multiple visits, everyone in our party has thoroughly enjoyed their dinner fare. I highly recommend the tacos al pastor or their empanadas. I've re-ordered both a few times. I was not super impressed with their House margaritas, but the food makes up for it. It's also quite large and even though it gets very busy, we have never had to wait too long to be seated. However long we have waited, it was worth it."}
{"text":"This place was not my favorite Mexican restaurant at all , all new indoor atmosphere  and a pleasant staff, service was slow at the bar before we sat and slow at our table when we sat, then the food was average ,the chicken was very chewy in my burrito,I'm willing to give it another chance but not any time soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a house hunting trip prior to our move from Houston and were excited we found this place. We came in about 3pm on a Sunday and we're greeted warmly by the staff.  Received chips and salsa almost immediately. A very attentive waiter brought us \"complimentary\" queso which was just thinned, heated white American cheese. No other flavoring. Salsa was overly tomato flavored and without many typical onion, cilantro and pepper chunks. We ordered a pitcher of house margaritas on the rocks which were okay. Mostly ice and little Margarita.   We both ordered combination plates with tamales, a chicken taco and a chili relleno with refried beans and rice. The rice and beans were nothing special. I have had better rice from a box at home. My chicken taco turned out to be a ground beef taco. We called the waiter over who apologized and said a new one would be sent out. Well it never appeared. Both tamales were in a \"corn dough\" that was more like a stiff corn pudding than a true masa shell. The filling was very scant and not very flavorful. The chili relleno filling was not tasty but the roasted poblano pepper was very good. We received our bill and the \"complimentary\" queso was charged and nothing was taken off for the taco mistake. Our waiter said next time we come back there wouldn't be any mistakes. He is correct because there is not going to be a next time."}
{"text":"We had dinner here a few nights ago. We were very happy with it. I was afraid that the fact that they had clearly spent a lot of effort on the interior design might mean that the food had that canned, corporate feeling to it. That is not the case. The food was all very good. I liked that unlike the typical \"Chi-chi's-esque\" Mexican restaurant, the food here was not just a handful of the same 4 ingredients rearranged in different ways and given different names. The dishes were actually different from each other. The refried beans tasted homemade. Also, the plate didn't come out laden with 10,000 calories, which I liked. I didn't finish eating and look at my plate with regret over what had just transpired. For $10 you can pick two items and two sides, which is what I did. Not only does this make more sense than reading through 42 combo options, but when you pick sides you can even pick soup as a side. You're not wedded to a scoop of rice to fill the space on your plate and in your stomach. And by the way, the tortilla soup was probably the best I've ever had. It was clearly built to a recipe and not just a chicken soup with some cream and spice added. It was full of tortilla strips which made each bite have an interesting texture. In summary: when a place offers a choice between northern or southern tamales, they probably know how to cook Mexican food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fresh ingredients. I loved the cilantro lime chicken tacos! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For a new place, on a Saturday night a few weeks in, I thought they pretty much had it together.  Food was fantastic. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Small portions for mexican food as oppose to other mexican restaurants where the prices are the same. Service was ok but staff seemed to fumble around with the larger tables. Once they get the kinks worked out I am sure they will be a good place."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos were amazing, the salsa was amazing, but the margarita sealed the deal. Will be back often!! People around me ordered queso and guacamole which they made in front of them, can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"We moved here from Texas and this is probably the best Mexican food we've had since we arrived.  Delicious complementary chips and salsa.  Drink specials every day ($2.50 XX beer tonight).  My park tacos with roasted pineapple we're on points.  Nothing to complain about.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely afternoon family dinner for our little grand-daughter's birthday at Totopo. The food was excellent, the service was wonderful and our server, Jesus, was such a lovely person. He patiently allowed us to\"practicar español\" with him. When I mentioned that it was a birthday celebration he brought us an extra special dessert(churros in an elaborate sundae) and the whole crew came out and sang Las Mañanitas to our grand-daughter (age 8). By the way, each of the 4 adults in our party had to get a take home container. The servings are that plentiful."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I ate here for the first time last night - we loved it!!  We started with the tableside guac and it was made to our specifications and was so fresh and delicious.  It accompanied the complementary chips and salsa perfectly!  For my entrée I had the pick 2 and went with an enchilada verde and a beef soft taco.  I chose the refried beans and the salad as my sides.  Everything was delicious!  I'm excited to try more of their menu and especially dessert - they have fried ice cream!  The service was wonderful and the pricing was fair.  What a welcome addition to the Mt. Lebanon dining scene!"}
{"text":"The food and service was great. I have been disappointed by so many Mexican restaurants lately but not this one! It was also nice that unlike a lot of other bars it was not extremely loud and annoying. Food tastes freshly made and sauces were spiced just right"}
{"text":"We all really enjoyed the food, and the guacamole was some of the best I've had. Staff was first rate."}
{"text":"Stopped in one night for a quick dinner at the bar and this place didn't disappoint. The drinks were delicious. I got a house margarita which was better than a mad mex marg. Great beer special in dos xx. I had the carnitas tacos and my fiancé had chicken tacos. They were both delicious. You get a lot of food for the price. Definitely a great Mexican place to visit."}
{"text":"My family decided to get lunch here on my birthday!  Wow!  What a great choice!  As soon as we sat down the server came over to us and welcomed us and brought us chips and salsa.   He was \"patient\" as we were munching on our chips and deciding what we wanted to order!  We ordered our meals , he got us refills and before you know it, our food came along!  I've had many mexican meals in the Pittsburgh area but this by FAR, TOPS EVERYTHING!  Also very friendly employees!   Food was very fresh!   Can't say enough!"}
{"text":"Never disappointing. The staff are attentive and the food is great.  The Choripollo Asada is amazing. The decor is inviting and beautiful."}
{"text":"excellent service.  they have a system of service and the food is very good.  in terms of overall experience, the best restaurant on Washington road, mt lebo.   great Margarita's.  the chorizo queso dip  is the best."}
{"text":"I went the first day at lunch, dinner & about 6 times the first week with different friends. There were service issues from the start, but we figured that would happen in the beginning.  Unfortunately that hasn't improved much. I was surprised the OWNERS NEVER came to the tables to greet the guests in those first few days.  Even when we mentioned issues, no manager or owner stopped by our table.  Although the food is really good, (specialties outstanding) the rice & beans are ALWAYS COLD (even now)  & the salsa is bland.  The biggest complaint though from friends was that instead of the wait staff clearing plates when the guests are done, the bus girl cleaned all the plates into a bus cart at the tables when the guests left.  VERY unappetizing!"}
{"text":"Situated in the old Walnut Grille spot right on Route 19 in Mt. Lebanon sits Totopo. A convenient parking garage is almost directly across the street, and costs $1(!) for more time than you'd spend in the restaurant.  This is one of the nicer Mexican restaurants inside in the area.  Nice decoration and ambiance including a huge Sun picture on the wall. It looks like there is plenty of seating.  The service was spectacular and really suits the likely regular clientele from the area. They were fast, efficient, and authentic. Both in terms of the food and desire to please the customer.   The drinks we chose were the Margarita and the Mexican Mojito. Both delicious if only a little light on the alcohol in the Mojito.   The table side guac is a really nice touch and absurdly fresh. You can say light on the japo's or onions, or anything but \"more avocados\" although I think they used four. Mixed in a stone pestle. It's $10 but is really worth it. Goes great with the fresh tortilla chips and thin slightly spicy salsa.  The main dishes we chose were the fajitas and topo-changa(ie boy meets chimichanga, if you catch the ref) which was a delicious take on the texmex dish. Everything was sizable and delicious. I was happy with the portion sizes, the taste, and the price.   The drinks are $7-$10, the entrees about $15, and many smaller dishes for less.   The dishes were more polished than other similar places, plating was done nicely, and overall a great contender in this genre of food.   We'll definitely be back! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Went here on my anniversary. I had a great experience . The service is good. Server and staff were attentive and polite. Brought refills of drinks and chips and salsa in timely manner. The salsa and guacamole were fresh. The chips tasted good. Our dinners were good and well priced. We both had the northern tamale and enchiladas verde . I also had the enchilada roja. The sides of rice and beans were good accompaniments. Recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh! After you eat here you will be mad at yourself for thinking that any other Mexican restaurant in PGH was good. You will start to question yourself if you have been eating dog food for the past dozen years. It's pretty much that life changing! I had this chicken & chorizo meal that was better than anything I've ever eaten before. I was not only on the verge of tears I was contemplating standing up and starting a round of applause. Go to this place right now!"}
{"text":"Excited to try this place but unfortunately didn't live up to the hype.  We got seats at the bar - it was busy for a week day. It was a cool place inside - dim lights.. festive decor.    I loved the margaritas and the upgrade to patron tequila was worth it indeed. The service was just lacking overall.  The two bartenders behind the bar were hustling but thinking a third bartender might have helped. We had to ask for silverware after our meal arrived and was tough to get anyone's attention. I don't know if I would come back on a weekend if it was this tough on a week day to get good service.  The food was ok..just average.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either..forgettable.   The quac was really great though. I might return and sit in the dining room next time."}
{"text":"This is one of the best and cleanest mexican restaurants I've ever eaten at. If you are looking to go somewhere with an authentic feel, this is the place. The decor is awesome. The food is great and the staff are very nice. We did not wait long to get our food. I had an appetizer, meal, and dessert, can't complain about thing. They also have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I had my hopes up that this new restaurant would be great, however, I was disappointed. I got the al pastor tacos, which had hardly any pork on them but we're full of raw onions. My husband got the cilantro lime chicken tacos. They were much fuller than my pork ones, but the chicken was so incredibly dry that they were not good at all. The rice served with the tacos had no flavor.  I will say, we did have good service sitting at the bar. The house margaritas and chips & salsa were both very good. Next time, I think we will just go for drinks & eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Reviews that say to go here instead of Mad Mex are planted. The food is salty and cheap and terrible. I won't ever come back here- I really had high hopes because friends told us it's always packed and when we went in, we got it... Booze! Boozey deliciousness. That's why I'm leaving 2 stars."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is a great place. It's a little pricy, but worth it. Food is great and service is excellent."}
{"text":"We visited for taco Tuesday ($2 basic tacos, $3 menu tacos). Also for happy hour. We were happy with the food and drink specials as well as the service. Everyone was polite and attentive. I wasn't crazy about the tacos but I will definitely come back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"I had super high hopes to Totopo as uptown Lebo was really in the need of a solid Mexican restaurant. Sadly, I wasn't terribly impressed with our experience. The restaurant is nice on the inside, nothing spectacular. We ate on the patio which could definitely use some sprucing up...but it's been the same since the space was Molly Branigan's so it was as expected.   The food was okay. My husband got the chicken fajitas, which were a bit dry (they actually were fantastic heated up on the stove the next day though). I got the steak and chili, which was incredibly spicy. I'm a huge fan of spice, but I had to remove the entire pepper from my plate because of the heat factor.  The staff was super polite and sweet, but extremely slow. There were guests behind us (a table of 4) who were seated before us and didn't get their meals by the time we left.   All in all, I would probably go back and give them another shot, but my expectations will be much lower."}
{"text":"I was sad to see Walnut Grill go but thrilled when a new Mexican restaurant was moving in to Mt. Lebanon. We went on a Saturday night and got in just before a wait started.  I went with the red Sangria and had drink envy when my fiancé ordered a margarita on the rocks-it was one good margarita.   Our waitress was fantastic and brought up complimentary chips and salsa right away and keep the refills going.  We loved that they menu had combo meals where you could choose to pick 2 or 3 items with 2 sides.   I went with 1 tacos & 1 quesadilla and got rice and the tortilla soup as my sides. The taco was ok-went with beef which came with cheese, lettuce and sour cream. Same with the quesadilla nothing special but tasted fine. The rice was very bland and needed some seasoning. The tortilla soup was fantastic and I wish I went with a bigger bowl of it.  The prices are very reasonable and the service was quick.  Overall we had a nice evening of mediocre Mexican food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have a favorite Mexican restaurant in New Jersey that we typically frequent and wanted to compare Totopo to that place.  It definitely matched up well.  The guac was made at our table and was fresh and delicious.  I ordered the shrimp & steak fajitas and the portion was very large and tasty.  If there is one downside to the meal, it was the Mexican rice which was rather plain.  My wife's chicken quesadillas were very good.   The service was good and Valerie, who was our waitress, got us everything we needed.  There were two TVs for the sports fan in the main seating area.  I would definitely recommend this for an affordable Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Tableside guacamole is amazing! I love the spicy jalapeno margarita. The food is delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"From the first step to end of the night was just perfect. Food is really great if u compare to other Mexican places, and its cheaper. Place is so fancy and staff are friendly. Def comin back soon"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food, but not quite a huge fan of Totopo.   I appreciated the great service from the wait staff here, but the food was pretty average. We ordered the queso dip, al pastor tacos, and fish tacos. The queso was pretty good, which the consistency was on the thin side. The pastor tacos were ok, but I expected them to have more flavor. They did come out with a salsa verde and a spicy sauce (I think it was a chipotle sauce) on the side. The fish tacos also could've used a bit more flavor. They were better with some salsa though. I thought the sides of rice and beans were also just ok; I still feel like I've had better.   I don't see myself completely avoiding Totopo, but unfortunately, I don't think it will be my first choice for Mexican."}
{"text":"for a friday night the food and service was very very good, from the chips and salsa to the table side guacamole. i definitely will be back. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Well, the food was delicious, unfortunately a waiter spilled guacamole down my side and my friends. They didn't do anything about it, sent the manager over and she did nothing. Now a brand new dress needs to get dry cleaning. This is the second time our service was bad at this place. It's a shame because the food is good, but the service is lackluster. My rating would be higher for the food, but considering the circumstances, I can't give them more. This is my first bad rating on yelp and I feel bad, but I just can't get past their performance."}
{"text":"Overall the restaurant was ok. I'd like to go back again once they've been open for longer and hopefully have worked some more kinks out. The drinks were VERY good, however they took so long to come out. By the time my first drink came out, I ordered the second one right then knowing it was going to take so much time before I got it.   The queso and guacomole were both very good, chipotle salsa not so much.   The vegetarian quesadilla was very good also, but I tried a bite of the chicken fajitas and the chicken was very bland and had absolutely no flavor, very disappointing.   Would definitely try again but if I continue to have mediocre experiences then I might be done with the place."}
{"text":"If you're unsure, or if your your significant other is anything like mine,  and can't make up their mind where to eat, don't second guess this place!  We just moved from California, where in every corner there is a Mexican restaurant and I've never been to a place like this. The food in just four words.......out of this world! From the moment you're greeted, to the friendly servers,  to the friendly guacamole maker (table side) to the amazing food, and until you leave, this place is spectacular!  Juan and his wife Danielle, the owners and host, are of the friendliest, most noble people I have ever met. They literally treat you like family. I felt like VIP. The decor of the restaurant is very authentic and has a very nice vibe to it.  The ambient music was awesome  and made me feel like I was in Mexico and made feel like I should start dancing with my wife by the table! I strongly recommend this restaurant.  Try the carne asada, or the choripollo! (Chorizo and chicken, see photos). Also try the empanada appetizer. To die for! This place opened up just about 6 weeks ago. And the place was full. That only tells you one thing.  It's popular and very delicious. This was on a Wednesday night!  Be sure to go for brunch too! They have a while different menu for brunch! So, if you're on the fence to try something new, or if for some reason some negative Nancy left a bad review, don't pay attention to it!  This place and this review is the real deal. GOOOOOO! You won't regret it,  and you'll thank me later. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Mexican food. We used to frequent Round Corner Cantina but that started going downhill. We found ourselves in mount Lebanon and stopped to eat at Totopo and it is delicious! I would give it a 5 if the drinks weren't so marked up and the $16 fajita wasn't 75% vegetables. Stay away from that ripoff. The chorizo queso dip is the best in the city I have had the pleasure of so far. The drowned burrito and chorizopollo are parades of flavor on the palate. I can't wait to try more. I just took my step dad with us to eat and he was impressed. Not easy considering the years we lived on the west coast in Oregon. Food trucks there 15 years ago put most overpriced restaurants here to SHAME. We miss Coffee People, authentic Mexican food, effective public transit, and businesses that actually adhere to their operating hours. Totopo fills a bit of our food scene shaped hole. The staff is friendly and the ambiance is great.  This will be our Mexican place until someone else steals my food loving heart."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner and drinks here, as well as Sunday brunch. The Mexican food is mexicali at it's best! Fresh, warm chips greet you as you wait for your meal and I enjoyed a yummy sangria margarita. They have a nice meal option where you can select from multiple entrees. Food was hot and delicious! Brunch has only a few options available for the meal, but both of ours were very good. One slight downfall was the orange juice served with the mimosas seemed of poor quality. But for a drink special, I overlooked it. Excited to go back again!"}
{"text":"Amazingly authentic Mexican food! So much yumminess - and large portions. Our waiter Fernando was incredibly friendly and attentive - and our kids thought he looked at bit like Cervelli, the Pirates catcher. ;) This wasn't our first visit, and it certainly won't be our last."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food!!! Great Mexican food with dishes you usually dont see in other spots. The Skinny Tacos were delicious. Chicken was savory and tender. It came as a surprise bc we asked for a dish that was more vegetarian (chicken the protein of choice), with no dairy. We had a salad with chicken and asparagus. It was fantastic!  The margaritas were delicious. And the staff were super friendly and accommodating. I had so much salsa, I am surprised they had any left!  Loved the space too. Very nice energy. Any place that has live plants is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Excellent service at the bar. Solid house margarita and bomb queso. The grilled burritos are very good. Definitely recommend and walking distance from the Marriott Staybridge."}
{"text":"You must get their queso! It's delicious. In fact, everything we got was delicious. We had quick, friendly service. They made tortillas right in front of everyone and they have table side guacamole. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and I'd put this one pretty high up there!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today...bonus that it was taco Tuesday...$2 tacos (lot's of varieties)!  They were delicious!! The (complimentary) fresh chips and salsa were great.  Fresh-made guacamole,friendly staff, great bar area! Happy hour Monday-Sunday  where they offer 1/2price house margaritas and draft beer. I can't wait to go back and try some of the specialty items on the menu, it all sounds delicious!"}
{"text":"Totopo is a relatively recent addition to Washington Road, and I'm going to be honest: they're a welcome breath of fresh air in comparison to the restaurant they replaced. The last place at this address seemed to vary in quality on an almost daily basis. Not Totopo. Every time I come here their servers impress me and the meals make me smile - as well as roll on out to stumble into a food coma.   Literally the worst thing I can say about Totopo is that their bar service once got a little slow on a busy night. That's not even a complaint so much as an observation of normal events in a restaurant. Heck, it's not even the norm - normally, service is prompt all around. And no matter how busy they've been, the bar hasn't made a single bad drink yet; my family and I visit often enough that we're working our way through the drink menu, and we love it all. (So far I recommend their mojitos above everything else.)  Food-wise, everything I've eaten here has been golden. If I had to make a few recommendations, the table-side guacamole and saving room for some dessert would be my top two. I can't name anywhere in the city that makes a better guacamole, as Totopo makes it tableside for you. And as difficult as saving room for sweet treats can be at a place like this, you'll absolutely want to save enough room to split their churros with someone. Nothing beats Totopo's fresh churros, which come in a bowl of ice cream and whipped cream that needs to be shared with someone. Unless you're ready to die from a sugar overdose. Which might not be a terrible way to go!  Needless to say, I'll be back to enjoy the dishes Totopo has to offer - whether I decide to get enchiladas, a burrito, or their surprisingly tasty skinny tacos...who knows, but I know it'll be good!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here it's been lovely. Tuesday's they have 2$ tacos so there's your first win. The also have VERY friendly servers and bartenders, that alone makes me want to go there again and again.   Their peach blended margarita is so delicious. And I obviously got tacos, also awesome. They came with amazing refried beans and rice! The best. A must go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to meet my friends for drinks and appetizers. I love the skinny margaritas and the fish tacos. The service is always friendly and the food is always consistently good. It's also a great place to get takeout. I've picked up lunch for the office several times and everyone loves it."}
{"text":"This place was crazy busy on a Thursday! I got a margarita and the fish taco special. Both were just okay nothing special. The fish tacos didn't have a strong taste. The waiter forgot to bring the guacamole we ordered, brought out the wrong sides, and it took us over a half hour to get our check. One of my friends ordered their enchiladas which looked great. The prices are super cheap."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas and delicious Mexican food! Have been here many times and have never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and I am a huge fan of Mexican cuisine. I've been trying to find a nice restaurant in the area with good food.  We sat at the bar. The service was super speedy and always on top of what we'd need next. I enjoyed a strawberry margarita. Not too sweet and not too strong. Just perfect! You can always judge a Mexican restaurant on their salsa and Totopo had fantastic salsa.   This place is much better than other sit-down Mexican restaurants I've found in the area. Plus it's very upscale inside and, of course, is situated in the adorable business district of Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"Stopped there for a drink in the middle of the afternoon, never been there before and had excellent service. Being apart of the service industry myself it's always great to have great service. I plan on going back and if anyone sees this and knows the industry I highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. The Fat Tire beer on tap tasted old. I placed my order and the waitress forgot to put it in. 30 minutes later after asking about my order, I barely received an, I am sorry.  I then ordered the burrito instead. It was caked in salt. Just ground beef wrapped and a sauce over the top, no sides. I really wanted to like this place, it just under performed. I probably would have said, hey there is an exception to poor service, things happen, if they would have confronted it and addressed it. But the Manager never came over and said anything.  I had to pay for the ground beef overly salted, wrapped in a soft shell,  with a sauce over it. I am not looking for a free meal. Just an honest sorry, things happen. It didn't happen tonight. They just wanted me to pay and leave.    Not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Food was great and very big portion. I recommend getting the fajita and tres leche cake as dessert!   The only downside is that there was a couple of added cost on my receipt that I wasn't aware of until later. For example, if you check in with yelp, you can get free quac or queso but they ended up charging me for queso even after checking in. Additionally, the fajitas was huge but only came with 3 small tortillas. Extra tortillas are $2 each time.   Overall, great food and atmosphere! Just double check your receipt and ask if things come in additional costs."}
{"text":"OMG! Really nice and cool place if you are going to meet with your friends! Their Margaritas-just mmmmmm....big selection of tequilas, good music for atmosphere and nice bartenders if you wanna relax-just do it"}
{"text":"Great place in Mt. Lebanon. Have been wanting to come here and try it for awhile. Their house margarita tasted awesome. I got the chile relleno and chimichanga combo. Very tasty! My mom got the carne asada. Cooked perfectly med rare. And very tasty. Giving it a 4 only because of service. But definitely would come back!!"}
{"text":"I really want to give a 3.5 but that isn't an option. The staff is super friendly. The chips are great. They do homemade gauc right in front of you and it's absolutely delicious. There are 12 beers on tap and they had a few great options.  Not a bad atmosphere although I loved when it was walnut (I came here weekly when it was walnut).   The tacos I had were \"skinny tacos\".  They had chicken that was very under seasoned. The \"roasted corn\" kind of tasted like it was just canned corn.  Everything tastes frozen or store bought.   My wife had the fish tacos. They weren't bad but all I could taste was the oil from the deep frier as the batter was very thick and heavy and it sucked up all the oil.   So all in all, I'd say great spot for drinks and some apps (and def get the gauc) but I prob won't get the food again as it was very average."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Best Mexican restaurant  around in my book. The cheese dip is awesome.  Margaritas oh yeah."}
{"text":"I'm torn about Totopo. I really like some aspects of the restaurant, and I'll happily eat there again, but it has some huge flaws that just kind of disappoint me.  So The Good: They have the most amazing table-side guacamole. Absolutely the best I've ever had, and I go there when I need a fix. The atmosphere is great, the servers have all been very nice and accommodating, and I love sitting there in the cozy, yet vibrant restaurant. They have a lot of great basic TexMex dishes, and I have enjoyed some of the more \"standard\" meals I've had there.  The Bad: The quality of the food is at what I would call an \"El Campesino\" level. El Campesino is a chain of restaurants where my friends and i would regularly go in college. We'd chow down on chips and salsa and lots of margaritas, and didn't really care that we were eating a cheap variation of what Americans think Mexican food is. So don't go to Totopo and order a steak, because you'll get a really pathetic steak. I ordered mine medium and got a grey slab, the quality of which might be found on the menu at a Denny's. The fiesta rice tasted like it was from a box. And the cheese is cheap as well. Authentic Mexico cuisine this is not.  The Ugly: Simple dishes that should be easy to make are ruined because the restaurant has taken shortcuts and uses boxed or frozen food. A perfect example is the cilantro rice. Should be easy, right? You make rice, you add some salt and pepper and cilantro. The rice was sugary, because they use a mix instead of making fresh food. Same for the lime vinaigrette salad dressing.  It was so sweet and the salad was so drenched that I could barely choke it down. I ended up eating the meat and leaving most of the lettuce on the plate.  So Totopo's is great for a night out with friends and family, as long as you aren't expecting this place to be high-end or upscale, like it's address or atmosphere might suggest. Stick to tried and true favorites like quesadillas, tacos, fajitas, etc., or maybe just go there for drinks and appetizers. It's a satisfying place, just not what i was hoping for in Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"So my partner and I usually patrons this place at LEAST 4 times a month. The staff is always welcoming and the food is always ALWAYS ALWAYS  GREAT! Jesus is the best to ever do it haha"}
{"text":"Haven't had Mexican in awhile.  Good selection and great service.   Was greeted right away and seated.    The atmosphere was nice.  They had live Mexican music playing.   Was there with another couple and the music made it hard for a conversation.  Al on all though a good experience.  Good portion sizes and came out hot.   The fried ice cream was fabulous"}
{"text":"Oh I want to go here! I hope they are wheelchair accessible! I go with my friend in my regular chair- The way they treat me is a sign that food is good & I heard good things now & they improved food and better options! Hopefully will go soon love Mexican food! I haven't had authenticMexican food in years! Their used to be a place at Zelenople airport called El Toros they were authentic anyone know if their still there?"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.. wonderful staff and fabulous and friendly bartenders. We live close, we go sometimes once or twice a week! Never disappointed. Good daily specials. Definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"A nice dinner here this evening of guacamole made at table and fish tacos. Mexican food what it should be: fresh and flavorful. We will return."}
{"text":"First time, good was wonderful, atmosphere was nice and lovely, but not too loud.  Try the tamales and the avocado cream dressing.  It was new to me and really tasty."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Mexican Restaurants!  They serve fantastic meals, and their Margarita selections are delicious.  Without overdoing the attention, the manager always stops by to make sure everything is well.  Their fresh salsa and and table side guacamole are great prequels to meals that have never disappointed."}
{"text":"was super delighted to hear of this place opening .  not the biggest fan of Mt. Lebanon and it's right-wing political atmosphere in most cases but, this place adds a much more authentic Mexican cuisine element to the South hills area and PGH, in general where it can still be hard to find more authentic/good Mexican grub despite so many Latin immigrants/migrants streaming in to this area all the time. Juan , the maitre'd / host apparently, worked for the Emiliano's Mexican restaurant chain before breaking away to do his own thing.   Walnut Grill was formerly, in this same space and it was never much to write home about, being standard / meh American food and so on . Mt. Lebanon surely needs some international flavor and culture and they have gotten some. The brunch/breakfast burrito was really good with eggs and chorizo ... the tortilla, excuse me, TOTOPOS as they're properly called were really tasty ... especially with their house red salsa and guacamole (that they come to the table to make in front of you... always nice... you know it's fresh, this a way .) there is a nice selection of tequilas and more importantly - MEZCAL, in the bar and there is a mezcal or tequila flight that you can get to sample 3 at a time ... the usual Mexican beers, as well ... more upscale in atmosphere than places like Patron and Rey Azteca but those place are also quite a bit further away if you live in the South hills area even if I do love the food at those places, as well . I hope to dine many more times at Totopo and highly suggest that you give it a try .  salud ."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite restaurant!  I loved everything about my second visit to Totopo, from the awesome host with that beautiful wide smile, to our friendly waitress, to the INCREDIBLE food.  Tonight it was a Northern Style Tamale and Chile Relleno with a side of black beans (some of the best I've ever had), and Fiesta rice.  All excellent.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Start with the chips and salsa, they are some of the best around. I got fajitas which I was worried about because they were $8. Trust me they are the best in town! Can't beat them!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The food never disappoints and the service is always great!   Soon as you get sat the chips and salsa are coming! The queso is to die for! From the tacos to the main dinners nothing is wrong! Love coming on Tuesday for taco Tuesday, the prices are always right! Can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Table side guacamole is a must have! Their house margaritas are also delicious *and a tad strong, but who doesn't love that (: Overall our dinner was delicious, and we had all of our food and drinks in a timely manner."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to Totopo Mexican Kitchen for our anniversary and we were not disappointed.  The restaurant had a nice selection of Mexican specialties including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, fajitas, tamale and more.  We were there during happy hour so drinks and appetizers were half off.  We ordered the Choriqueso, a cheese and chorizo dip with roasted poblano peppers, prepared right at the table.  It was delicious.  For dinner, I ordered a grilled steak burrito that was stuffed with steak, cilantro rice, and beans.  On the side was a very nice salad with a spicy balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  My wife ordered a combination that included a chicken and salsa verde tamal and beef enchilada with black beans and cilantro rice on the side.  Both of our meals were excellent.    The ambiance is a modern take on the typical Mexican decor with cleaner lines and less of the kitschy Mexican motifs found in other restaurants.  In addition to a well stocked bar, Totopo has a moderately sized dining room as well as a party room suitable for large groups. Overall, we had an excellent experience at Totopo and would defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, \"I'm not a big Mexican food fan.\" That said and out in the open, they have really yummy salsa, chips and GUACAMOLE! You must order the tableside prepared guac. It was really delicious! I ordered a pick 2, having an enchilada and a quesadilla. They were both very good and a nice size portion. It came with a side. I ordered the salad. Unless you are a fan of cilantro (I am NOT!!), skip the salad. The other options for dressing just didn't work for me; they were generic and bland. We didn't order drinks, but they did have a nice size bar with lots of options. The others in my party had salads and loved them! Again, cilantro is like poison to me; so I would not have ordered them. We didn't have leftovers, but were definitely full. Give it a try and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"This place is good and I like it.  I might rate them 3.5 starts if I could.  But at the end of the day, it's a good take on fairly standard Mexican-American food.  No, they don't have the generic menu (no \"Speedy with Rice\" on this menu), and their food is fresh and well prepared.  And the service is good.  That said, I want to love this place, but I cannot find anything special enough to bump them up to four stars.  It's pretty standard, and it is well executed.  Give them a try and post a review."}
{"text":"Came here for a Corona event that one of her friends was throwing. We ordered the guacamole and queso. The guacamoles made at the table side and was fresh and delicious. I had the chicken lime tacos, they were good but I feel the chicken was overdone. The tortillas are the traditional tortillas that you get at any other Mexican restaurant. Still looking for a dish that puts them over the top. But if you're looking for standard staple Mexican food this will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Pittsburgh! We have been several times and have enjoyed every time.  Service is always great and food has not disappointed.  Our go-to orders are the drowned burrito and veggie quesadilla.  Only thing We have tasted that we thought left room for improvement was the black beans-kind of bland. Absolutely LOVE that they do delivery for dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Pittsburgh for tacos. Overall the food is amazing and authentic."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's very family-friendly. They make guacamole and other dishes right at your table. The queso with sausage is delish! And the drinks are great too. My only complaint is the music. They have the same loop on every time we go and much of it Colombian music, not Mexican. Would love if they'd spice it up a bit."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday Afternoon. I ordered the guacamole it was fantastic, also the horchata....delicious!!! My meal was choripollo... Very tasty. Service was good. I definitely go back and try more food!!! I think the staff are making a very good job."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Ivan is the best waiter and very friendly! Definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Dined here last night and I thought it was excellent! We had the guacamole made at the table. That was very good. I had the lime chicken taco. There were 3 of them served in a 6 inch double soft shell. At first it didn't look like a lot of food but they were very filling. They were also served with beans and rice which was good. The red sangria was delicious! My so. Had the taco and fries and he liked it (he's 2) so much so that he was asking for his left over fries in the car on the way home. Our waitress was very good and engaged with him very well. Our food came out quick and we never had to look for her to ask for more refills; she was there frequently at the table. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Average at best.  Everything we had was very bland and under flavored compared to other Mexican restaurants around.  I would go to EL Paso or Emilianos and day over the week over this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in this awesome place because we happened to be in town. Our party of 9 was seated quickly in a comfortable area. Got chips and salsa right away. Our waitress handles all 9 orders with ease and got everything correct! Our chips and salsa were refilled and we loved the salsa so much we took 2 jars home.   Food quality was above compare - spicy, hot and delicious.   Atmosphere is lovely - the a/c wasn't blasting so we felt comfy in our shorts and tees. Music was great background and did not prohibit conversation. Large seating area."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had in Pittsburgh. Waitress was darling!  Food was delicious. They have only been open two weeks and they knocked it out of the ball park.  The place was packed!  Service was good. We will definitely return. Lots of restaurants in uptown Mt Lebo, but never a Mexican restaurant!  Terrific addition to Mt Lebo!!"}
{"text":"We stopped last Wednesday and so glad we did!  Delicious Margaritas, great guac and chips with salsa to start.  The Tortilla soup really good and hearty.  Had the Tacos Al Pastor for dinner  - fantastic, they were seasoned just right with roasted pineapple and cilantro.  Good stuff.  We will be back.  Got free guac with the Yelp check in btw...."}
{"text":"We've been trying different places instead of the same old same old. With the help of yelp we found this great place. We checked in using yelp and got a free quac which was awesome. I ordered the nachos w taco meat as my dinner and LOVED it. It was so flavorful. It happened to be happy hour and to my surprise it was half off! I would definitely come back here again. I have some pics although they don't do the food justice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the South Hills. I have visited numerous times and have always had an enjoyable experience.  My favorite item on their menu is their guacamole... They make it table side and have a few varieties to choose from. We order the chips and guac every single time we go there... it's that good!  I'm also a big fan of their margarita sampler. You get five little margaritas of different flavors, and they're all delicious. Drink them quickly, though, because once they melt they don't quite taste as great.  My favorite menu item is the chicken quesadilla. I'm also a fan of the chicken tacos that are served in lettuce, as opposed to a taco shell.  The rice and beans sides are also served hot and fresh. The only downside is the portions. I usually have leftovers when I visit a Mexican restaurant but tend to eat my entire meal here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and beside a wait in prime times I don't have a bad thing to say about the food. Everybody in my party's have enjoyed everything as well."}
{"text":"First time eating in, but have ordered many times. Can't say enough good things. The atmosphere, decor and the food was fantastic. You have to try the tableside Guac, so fresh and tasty. Chips and salsa were great also. My wife's taco salad was very good and she loved her Mojito. I got a triple combo, tamale, enchilada and chile rellano, a trifecta of tasty Mexican treats. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Sitting here in this random suburb of Pittsburgh, PA. and got to the hotel at 9:40pm and there happened to be only 4 places open past 10pm.  We decided to hit up Totopo and we were Not disappointed!   The location is fantastic and beautiful inside, though parking kinda sucks and they do not have a private lot.   However let me say this....    THE BEST GUACAMOLE DIP I HAVE HAD SINCE PIPI'S IN PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO! Made to order at your table, fresh, ripe and absolutely wonderful.   A lot of mexican/ spanish restaurants are hit or miss on certain items, but everything was on point here. Even at 10:20pm at night! Everything from there spanish rice which has a great flavor, to their refried beans which were very fresh.   There signature Chimichanga with chicken are fantastic. Filled with a ton of flavored shredded chicken, topped with queso and signature sauce drizzled on top.   prices are on point as well."}
{"text":"After checking in and getting settled in our hotel, we decided we were hungry and needed to eat. We got online to check out some local places, and decided to come here. OMG I AM SO GLAD WE DID!! I am not really a big fan of Mexican, but this place was well worth it.  First thing I did was order a Margarita, and it was so good!! it was also pretty large for the price we paid, which made it worth purchasing. We also decided to get their guacamole, and I was so excited when they brought it out. They prepare it at your table, which is the exact same thing they did in Mexico when we were there! It tasted delicious, even my daughter loved it! The entree's were good as well. Lots of food. I definitely want to go back, even if it is just for guac!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local Mexican restaurants!! They have the best margaritas, you can tell are not made from a mix because they taste so good! When we first got there the waiter was awesome and brought over 2 baskets of chips and salsa right away. I order the mahi mahi fish tacos (they are not on the menu anymore but they still make them) and they were amazing!!!! I usually don't like fish on tacos but they were so meaty and didn't taste too fishy like other fish tacos I've had in the past. The table side guacamole is definitely worth it for an appetizer, it's cool being able to watch it be made and it's so good!"}
{"text":"I am so ecstatic that we get to add this restaurant to our list of safe restaurants for our children.  Our children suffer from a rare auto-immune disorder that causes food allergies.  Hector, our waitor, was wonderful with making sure our food was safe.  I have Celiac's disease and had a great meal, too.  Try them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This spot is great for good Mexican food and good drinks. Great atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Totopo is spanish for tortilla chips! True story! One thing the south hills is lacking is a good Mexican place, thank goodness for this place! Right on Washington road in Mt. lebo, this is the Mexican food you are looking for. Great staff, great service and the food is excellent. The price is right and the atmosphere is very cool. The drinks are really good, and they have daily specials I love the chorizo cheese dip and the tacos are muy bien! Also you can't leave with out getting the table side guacamole! Made fresh right in front of you."}
{"text":"Great new place! Happy hour specials are fantastic! Everything was great, drinks/apps/dinner. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very bland American version of Mexican food. Use a lot of Cilantro and cayenne and call it Mexican.  Bottom line, no pork dishes and this is Mexican?"}
{"text":"When Walnut Grill closed, I can't say I had any sort of feels.  But when I heard a Mexican restaurant was moving in, oh heck yes!!! My Fiancé and I finally checked Totopo out the other day, and the only regret I have is not going sooner. We went on a Friday night around 6. It looked semi busy when we got there; we were told a 25 min wait but it was only about 10 min! (Btw when we left at around 8-830, place was bumping!)  Chips and salsa are great, they sort of remind me of Emiliano's. The house margs are two thumbs up, delish! I ordered the tacos al pastor, fiancé ordered a chorizo burrito. Both were SO GOOD!!! We didn't get dessert but the menu seemed pretty basic for Mexican (fried ice cream, churros, etc.). They have a good selection of beers and mixed drinks, with reasonable prices! Oh, they even have daily specials. Wednesday was a wine marg deal for $5, gonna be hard not to hit that up every Wednesday.   One thing I want to make sure to touch on is the service. I know I've only been there once, but it's a new place and I was impressed with or service we had. From the host, to the bartenders, to our waitress, great service! I read some reviews before stopping in that talked about bad service, my tip is to give them a chance to get used to doing business and try it again!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite spot for Mexican. Food is consistently delicious, drinks are good and strong and service is always on point. My husband raves about their choripollo and I'm a huge fan of their salads and fish tacos. Love the cozy Spanish atmosphere. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING, FLAVORFUL AND IMPRESSIVE. KEEP IT UP. THE AMBIENCE IS VERY INVITING, TRENDY AND UPSCALE . IT SHOULD BE THE STANDARD FOR ALL PITTSBURGH ESTABLISHMENTS .  the north hills and other area Mexican places are tired and have lost appeal. In fact Patron another Mexican restaurant  is more like a fast food place with its loud , echoey building and hideous slapped together patio that looks more like a third world design than an American one, watery, artificial margaritas and cheap decor.  El camp has bland food , artificial margaritas,  poorly presented food and tables and chairs that are wobbly, Unclean and in need of replacement.   We love to TOTOPOS fresh juices used in the margaritas and the peach frozen one is also amazing.their table side molcajete served guacamole is very good. The tomatillo sauce is superb, thick, rich unlike other places which is watery and thin.   We had attentive service both times we went, we sat at the bar because we like adult like ambience, not families .  Our food arrived quickly. I wish they opened later on Sunday's . They close at 9 .   We loved the tamales in corn husks, pork tacos al pastor, flavorful refried beans and the corn soup was delectable . I wish they had chicken soup daily on the menu but they seem to rotate their soups . Food and serving trays and plates are ornamental . It seems like other Mexican places have lost the art of food presentation.   We enjoyed the music here too.   I would like a tv screen to show something other than sports though. Sports inside Mexican establishments diminishes  the quality and experience of the cultural ambience. I would suggest management should play a travel channel or broadcasts footage of Mexico on a screen to promote the culture and food instead of all of the screens showing distractive sports   It is clear that the management cares about quality. I hope they keep it up and don't let their guard down and become like all the other Mexican places have in the region. I hope they don't dumb down to Pittsburgh palates and destroy their good  food.  I hope they will not let the bar be overcome with sports channels. This is not a sports bar. Sports are not relaxing to the mind , ears or eyes   ^^ I will say the chicken in the taco salad is tasteless and the dressing is not good. it's too sweet and thick . The pre made margaritas are good, but are too orangey. Less orange would be better. Traditional margaritas are made with lime or lemon  Overall we will be back and are happy."}
{"text":"Totopo is one of my new favorites restaurants in the city! I'll across a bridge to hit up Totopo!   My boyfriend and I wanted to celebrate Cinco de Mayo early - so we made our way to restaurant around 6:15pm. There was no onstreet parking available, so we parked in a nearby parking lot for $2.   Totopo was celebrating Cinco de Mayo all weekend long, so it was the busiest it's been when I've been there. We had to wait about 35 minutes - they were giving away free prizes, so it wasn't too bad. I won a Totopo glass.   Once we finally got seated - we ordered our drinks. I ordered a strawberry frozen margarita and my boyfriend ordered a original mojito. The bar was a little backed up, but once the drinks came - they were delicious.   To start we ordered the table side guacamole and the taquitos. Everything was amazing!   We both ordered the chicken quesadillas for our entrees- heads up! It's not listed on the menu, but it's chicken, cheese, and green peppers in the quesadilla. My boyfriend had to pick his out since he doesn't like them.   For dessert- he ordered the churros! He said it was delicious!   We will definitely be going back to Totopo soon!"}
{"text":"Update to previous review.  All previous issues I had with service and food have been addressed.  Very tasty and fresh burrito. Professional and attentive service.  Some Mexican restaurants seem overly oily or not fresh, bit not Totopo, super fresh ingredients and cooked well."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food for anywhere not just Pittsburgh. We lived in California 35 years and this place rocks. Can't say enough about the al pastor tacos tableside guacamole and fish tacos. Skinny margarita was very good also excellent service"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican for Pittsburgh. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the mood for Tex Mex. I had the fish tacos and they were awesome. The queso blanco was perfect and the field ice cream was pretty great too. Our waitress was really attentive and fun to talk to. I'll absolutely go back.   Came back again a few times and I'm changing my rating from a 4 to a 5. It's better every time we're here. Shrimp enchiladas and fish tacos are soooo good. Service is always amazing. Probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh right now."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was served promptly by a friendly and helpful server. Great chips and salsa. Meal was excellent and tasted more authentic than other Mexican places. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to come here for the longest time since it first opened. Finally made it this past weekend (Saturday Night). If you are a group of 5 or more - I highly recommend making a reservation. Since they don't accept reservation for group that's smaller than 5, The lady and I along with my sister whose birthday we were celebrating stopped by around 7PM and boy was it packed. The bar was packed and the wait for a table was about 40 minutes but nonetheless we agreed to wait. About 40 minutes later - we were seated.  We were quickly waited by a friendly server along with a complimentary chips and salsa. We got few different items including chicken enchilladas combo, hard taco shell with chicken (with salad and soup), fish tacos, vegetarian quesedilla and the highly recommended guacomole dip. I didn't really care for the Enchilada (which was part of the combo) but the rest were really good. If you didn't know the combo (pick 2) means 2 entree and 2 sides (4 items in total) from the combo menu respectively. However, the size will be smaller than the regular menu items. So, make sure to order accordingly.  For such a packed place, the service was quick and great. Although we were all full, we made sure to get a churro dessert for the birthday girl and along with that came a sombrero hat on her and an outstanding Birthday Wish performance in Spanish by the manager, host along with few other staffs.  Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great prices! I'm always pleased with my experience at Totopo. Highly recommend the queso and the table-side guac!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  My boyfriend and I have been here 3 times now and every experience has been a terrific one. The staff are very nice and know how to exceed a customers expectations. Not to mention the food is phenomenal! The prices are just right in comparison to the huge portions you get.  Thank you Totopo"}
{"text":"great margaritas and good portioned vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Great, fast service and great for the kids. That's all a parent needs to hear, right? Well the food is awesome too...and there are margarita specials. Bonus! Make a reservation to make everything even more easier. I'd describe the food as neat, fresh and well-spiced Mexican. Not as authentic as one might crave, but well worth a visit or ten to this great, big space."}
{"text":"This place was just ok as I wasn't too impressed with what they had to offer. I ordered take out on a week night since It was close by and I haven't tried this place. I ordered two entrees which was pick two dishes with two sides for $12. At the beginning it sounded as a good deal so for the first entree I got two northern tamales, fried beans and rice. The second entree was two tamales, rice and soup. To our disappointment, the portions were small and the food wasn't anything extraordinary. I didn't really like my tamales as the chicken was dry and the masa tasted a bit different than what I'm used to. The portion of the fried beans was a bit less than half the serving cup that it came in. The only thing that was good was the soup. In addition, they gave us free chips but what's the point when there was no salsa?   Overall my takeout experience wasn't that great but perhaps dining in is better. Would I do take out from them again? Definitely no. Would I try dining in to see if the experience is different? I will need some convincing but probably."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and friendly staff. Will definitely go back. Try the chicken quesadilla. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Go here instead of Mad Mex! Food is authentic and very good. Great chips and salsa. Half price Margaritas are excellent! Had the fajitas and Pick 3 option -- both good choices. Tacos and tamale were good.  Great service as well.  And the best, prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I had my son's graduation party in their private party/conference room (back of the restaurant). I was very happy with the experience! Mya was the manager handling the event, and she was very patient throughout my many calls and questions. She let me know ahead of time that she wasn't going to be there the day of, and she was very careful to share all of the information with those who would be there. This attention to good communication was very noticed and very helpful! Everything was set up as we discussed. The server, Gabby, had been well informed. The other manager already knew about the tech needs/set-up. All of the staff seemed genuinely interested in making sure the event was a success, and I really appreciated that! The room was very nice - clean, private, and great décor. The LCD was easy to use. They quickly found things we needed to hang a few decorations. Setting up was easy, and it looked great! The food was good. We had a buffet that included salad, 2 appetizers, and fajitas. I've eaten at Totopo several times before, and we really enjoyed those previous meals! The buffet wasn't quite as excellent, but still good. I just chalked it up to the difference between an individual meal and a buffet. And the price was very reasonable for an all-you-can-eat buffet that included non-alcoholic drinks. And the guests enjoyed having Mexican food instead of the traditional graduation cook-out.  The facility and customer service really made this an amazing experience. They were genuinely friendly, and that makes such a difference! My son, family, and friends had a great time. Thanks Totopo!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican bars. The bartenders are so personable and fun. They make great margaritas. Ask for a spicy one and they will make it pretty spicy."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The inside has a great atmosphere and feel to it.  It is very clean and authentic.  The hard working staff also made for a great experience.  My wife and I had the queso as an appetizer.  Both the chips and the dip were fresh and tasted great.  The dip was not runny and had a perfect cheesy flavor.    For my meal I had the fish tacos.  These were possibly the best fish tacos I have ever had.  The breading was not too thick and you still picked up on the fresh fish flavor.  The toppings and sauce that come with them were perfect choices.  The little bit of heat with the chipotle sauce was balanced out perfectly by the slaw and cilantro.  Both my wife and I cleared our plates, which can be tough to do at Mexican restaurants, but the food was that good.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for a quick bite before going back to work and the food was great! You get a lot of food for the price! They also have a hot salsa that I've never had anywhere else. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu and to get more of that hot salsa!"}
{"text":"This was our second time to this awesome restaurant. We were celebrating my 40th birthday and this is the place I chose and I am so glad I did. There were 22 of us and when we got there they had us set up at a table in the back which was perfect! The service was impeccable and the food outstanding! Thank you totopo for making my birthday extra special. I will continue to send everyone I know into your restaurant. If you go get the Guacamole and the shrimp tacos are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant, and I have to say, I was far from impressed by this place! I went with a group on 12 later in the evening on a Saturday night. With the restaurant being new, I have to say, they were quite accommodating and sat us rather quickly. But, after being seated, it took a good 15 minutes or so before we were even brought water. Then, after finally being given water and chips, another 15 minutes or so passed before anyone was asked if they wanted other beverages and/or appetizers. I was starving, hence grouchy, so not incredibly happy at this point. I dug into the chips, which were not bad, but slicked with oil. They were hands down the greasiest tortilla chips that I have ever had. This might be someone's dream come true, but I just don't like greasy food, but, like I said, I was starving, so beggars can't be choosers. The salsa was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.   Finally, after being there for what seemed to be an eternity, our food arrived. I ordered the Tacos Al Pastor, usually one of my favorites because I loooove pork. These were HORRIBLE! There were three tacos in the order, each of which came with two corn tortillas sort of fused together. The doubling up of the tortillas made for a really dry base for the taco. Inside the taco, there was hardly any filling, so I was basically just eating corn tortillas. Not cool. The pork inside was cubed, which was weird. I expected it to be shredded. The cubed pork was slimy on the outside and dry on the inside, and relatively flavorless. It was truly godawful. The only thing that added flavor to these tacos were the slices of pineapple in them, and thank god for those, because otherwise I would have probably gagged. I kept trying to compensate for the lack of flavor/texture of the food by dousing the tacos with the sub-par guacamole that I ordered, but this was hardly to any avail. I was incredibly disappointed with these half-ass tacos. I know plenty other places locally that serve incredible Mexican food, so there is no need for me ever to return to this establishment.   Word to the wise--do not let the cute decor and location fool you--this place sucks! I know it's new and new restaurants always face challenges, but excepting the bad service likely due to the newness of the restaurant, the food just ain't good."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new favorite Mexican restaurant since Gran Agave closed in the Waterfront. I've tried several places and they were mediocre until I found Totopo on Yelp! It was packed, but worth the wait. The food was very delicious and flavorful. The service was just as great. It didn't take long for the food to be served either even with a huge party they were hosting in the side room.   The only complaint I have, it's not really even a complaint, but the frozen mango margarita wasn't strong. I like to taste my tequila and I couldn't. Haha. It was still tasty though.    I will definitely be back and will recommend to others! Thank you Totopo."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! All very fresh and authentic! Welcome here almost weekly whether it's brunch, lunch or dinner and it's always top notch! Try the chori-polo!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"The Totopo's restaurant experience was great. We were seated immediately for a Tuesday evening at 6pm. The decor is modem, colorful and comfortable. Of course, like many others these days, HD televisions were viewable from seating near the bar. The facility was clean, the staff was 100% welcoming. First, the salsa and chips were loaded with fresh ingredients and taste. I really liked the salsa, it was nice & thick and stuck to the chips. Tuesday's are two-dollar taco, with premium tacos for three-dollars. I had two of the skinny-tacos; large leaf lettuce takes the place of the taco shell. They were spot on perfect. One of the two tacos was part of my combo plate. The combos give you a choice of two menu items with two sides. Frijoli's and Black beans were my sides and both were filled with flavor and delicious. The other side of my combo was a burrito, smothered in a peppery tomato sauce. Overall, you couldn't find a better place for Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best.  Not only were the fish tacos not as hot as they should be, but burrito was not prepared per the menu.  The server said that sometimes the cook staff doesn't prepare food as expected.  The chips were hard and unsalted also.  My suggestion: If you want good Mexican food, don't go here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pretty amazing. The service was on point. Loved the music and the food was perfect!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places I've ever eaten and we will definitely be back again.  I would recommend the naked burrito with chicken and chorizo.  Yuuuuuummmm"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food.  There was a little confusion but likely caused by our group and kids. Food is refreshingly different."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place. Food is good. Toppings for burritos are very very skimpy. Not enough for one shell let alone 3. The drinks are very good and I didn't think they skimped on them at all. There is room for improvement however. Very clean, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"So my Girlfriend and I went to Totopo on Cinco de Mayo, real original I know. We were totally accepting of the fact that we would probably be walking into a shit show, however, from start to finish we had an incredible experience. Before we could even get settled at the bar, Jesus greeted us with a warm smile, took our drink order and even helped us pick the perfect tequila to sip on. He was back with our libations before we could even crack open the menu. Once we got our bearing's he arrived once more with complimentary chips and salsa and took our order. We started with the taquitos which were fantastic. I recommend requesting a lime wedge with them, as they benefit greatly from a little acidity. For my entree I did the pick 3 combo for 14$, which is a great way to sample multiple items. I chose a roja cheese enchilada, verde chicken enchilada and chili relleno. Everything was just superb, one offense I find with some Mexican restaurants is under seasoning their meat, but that is certainly not the case at Totopo. My GF had tortilla soup and Choripollo Asado, which is an amazing blend of shredded chicken and chorizo served with fresh made tortillas. She was in Heaven. Even though the place was packed with anxious, and somewhat obnoxious patrons, the staff kept their composure and from what I could tell, turned out fabulous consistent customer service. We will most certainly be back, and hopefully Jesus will be behind the Bar."}
{"text":"We went on Friday night to sit at the bar and have a drink and an appetizer. The place is big inside & decorated very nicely. They spent money on the build out. It was crowded. The bartenders were very efficient & friendly. Their chips and salsa were very good. Their guacamole was one of the best I've ever had. The atmosphere was festive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is quite a nice \"upscale\" Mexican place with several seating areas as well as a central bar. The whole environment feels pretty nice--lighting and music are at comfortable levels, the restaurant and restrooms are kept clean, and the staff are generally welcoming. The menu seems pretty standard and isn't one of those where you choose among 50 different combinations of meats, tortillas, and refried bean sides. The fajitas looked like a major part of the menu, so we got the mix 3 with chicken, steak, and shrimp. While waiting we snacked on the warm tortilla chips, but we didn't have to wait too long for the fajitas to come out sizzling. It was a very decent portion with as much or even more meat than the peppers and onions. We found it all to be seasoned well with lots of flavor, and the meats were all cooked perfectly. There were also the standard sides of lettuce, salsa, cheese, rice, and beans. It was a very satisfying meal--plus if you check in on Yelp, you can sample some of their guac."}
{"text":"Totopo is a festive addition to Mt Lebanon! We made a reservation via Yelp to take grandma for a birthday celebration. Our server was very sweet, but seemed a bit rushed all night.   We started with the table-side guacamole, which was fresh and delicious! We enjoyed having them make it at our table, and the fresh taste.  We each ordered different items for dinner, and were all pleased with our choices. The food was all fresh and flavorful, but I'd try something other than the enchiladas rojo next time - they were a bit heavy for me.   FYI- We thought we ordered the Yelp check-in offer guacamole, but they brought us the table side guacamole. When we went to pay she told us she brought us the table side guacamole instead of the 4oz one, and we had to pay for it... bummer but figured I would share so someone else doesn't run into that problem."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always friendly staff, great atmosphere, the food is always incredible and they make a great margarita."}
{"text":"I absolutely love totopo. The food is always above and beyond with freshness and taste. I was lucky enough to go here for margarita day and the margarita flights let me figure out which were my favorites. The cucumber one is something I would have never tried a whole one of, but was awesome and refreshing with a spicy rim."}
{"text":"Loved the healthy option of skinny tacos on the menu.. Accompanied by a freshly juiced margarita on the rocks...  Very nice night can't wait to return! Ps- the salsa is amazing!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. Totopo wins all around. They have the BEST service out of any restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh. Chewy and Ivan are two of my favorites but I love the whole team :)   Food I'm obsessed with - fish tacos, table side guacamole, chorizo queso, chori pollo   Margaritas are great too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best taco I have ever had in America. Get the cilantro line chicken taco! You will not be disappointed! Great service, great location."}
{"text":"I had read mixed reviews, but like to try a place out for myself to make up my mind.   I'm glad I went!  The service was outstanding and the food was amazing!  We had the chips & guac for an appetizer - very good.   Hubby did the pick 3 and I did pick 2.   Meals came with 2 sides.  Alot of food for your money.  I think the pick 3 was $14 and the 2 was $12.   I got a taco & quesadilla with black beans and soup.  The soup was a corn soup.  I expected it to be a chowder but it was a bisque & very tasty!!!! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to taking my husband here since he loves Mexican food. I came here one time prior for drinks and it was fabulous. This experience was less than that.   The drinks & food were great. The service however was terrible. Our waiter (Fernando) gave us attitude for asking for more salsa chips... (we ordered the queso dip and made to order guacamole). They only give you alittle bowl with chips so I didn't understand what the issue was. We ordered margaritas and I got the Mango one and my husband got the traditional. Both good. The server asked if either of us wanted another drink and my husband said yes. 30 minutes go by and he never received his drink. The food came, which what I got was delicious (pollochorizo)- it was chicken breasts with queso and ground sausage, came with soft tortillas, pico and sour cream. Delicious.   We felt alittle better after eating our food, and instead of spending more $$$ on drinks since he never cared to bring the last ones and seemed like he was rushing us out (it was not busy there for being a Tuesday night so I didn't understand that).   Our bill came out to $73.95 without a breakdown of the items we got. My husband said it didn't look right at all as he calculated what we ordered. It was $17 more than what it should've been. We confronted the server and he said that was correct. I added the items on my phone calculator to show him and it was $17 more. He went in the back to check after I told him I wanted the breakdown. He came back and said it was $17 more he \"accidentally\" added extra items.  I was beyond furious. You would think he would've offered some sort of discount or took an appetizer off of the bill since that took an extra 20 minutes to prove we were correct.   Food was good, but there are PLENTY of places in pgh I'd rather go to. I can't believe the service we received. I should've complained to the Manager but I honestly did not want to stay there any longer.   Beware of items getting added on your bill. Seems like they may be doing that to more customers....  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Like everyone else in Lebo, I was excited when a Mexican restaurant opened Uptown. I wasn't impressed my first visit, but after my third visit tonight, that opinion was confirmed. Our party of six had multiple mistakes with our meals, the service was slow, and our margaritas were so watered down we wondered if there was alcohol. Everyone agreed the food was mediocre. The noise level was so loud we could barely hear one another. Two members of our party said they wouldn't return. My #1 favorite Mexican restaurant in town remains La Palapa on the South Side. Even Bea's Taco Town is better."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place!!!! Mt. Lebanon, you never disappoint me. The vibe of the restaurant is cozy, colorful, and warm. My boyfriend and I were feeling it from the moment we walked in. The fresh chips (amazing) and salsa were brought promptly to our booth and devoured just as quickly. I took advantage of the complimentary queso dip with the Yelp check-in and boy oh boy, am I glad I did! OUTSTANDING. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp tacos and said they rival the best he's ever had. I ordered the steak fajita nachos, and not only are they gorgeous to look at, they're equally scrumptious. My boyfriend had a late barber appt across the road so I moved to the bar to enjoy a frozen peach mango margarita while he got a haircut. The margarita was great, blended perfectly, & equal parts sweet and tequila.  Do yourself a favor and go give this place a try if you haven't already .... sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about Totopo! My friends and I were looking for a good spot to have afternoon drinks. We got there around 3pm on a Saturday, and for an unusual time of day, the place was poppin! The bar area was completely full (definitely a good sign for a group of girls looking for some margaritas). We were instantly seated, and our server came over quickly with chips and salsa. You get a free order of guacamole or queso when you check in on Yelp!  I order a chicken chimichanga at every Mexican restaurant I go to, and Totopo's was definitely one to beat. It was jam packed with shredded chicken and topped with freshly made pico. My friends ordered the fajitas and the skinny burrito, and they both looked fantastic! Oh, and did I mention that the giant margaritas are fantastic?! AND that they are 1/2 off during happy hour?!  If you're in Mt. Lebo, and looking for an awesome Mexican restaurant, def check out Totopo!"}
{"text":"Love love love the tacos al pastor. My husband fancies the choriqueso dip!  This place is definitely spot on Mexican. Don't miss the Sunday $5 mimosa."}
{"text":"Good food, low cost.  Not the most authentic, or consistent.  I've had the chilli rellenos made three different ways before. Once even forgetting the eggy batter on them."}
{"text":"Oh lovely Totopo!! If only other restaurants could learn from the service your staff gives. It's always so prompt & attentive.  Also, the food the both times we have been is fantastic.  The fish tacos are possibly the best in Pittsburgh.  Also, the wife loves the choriopolla asado bowl. LIKE LOVES IT!!! Keep up the good work.  Any one looking for Mexican, this is highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this place. We were kinda excited to check it out but ended up disappointed.  My wife ordered the enchiladas but asked for only cheese, no meat. I also ordered the enchiladas but wanted them with meat. The waiter was polite but didn't speak English very well at all. Her enchiladas arrived and the cheese was cold and not melted. My enchiladas were the same as hers, no meat at all. I told the waiter and he didn't understand so he had to get some me else who spoke English.   My enchiladas came out quickly and we're good, not great really.  Overall the food was ok, the service was ok and the whole experience was just ok. I don't know if we'll be back or not. Hopefully others have a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"Eh, I'd give this place 2.5 stars. I've been here twice and both times left underwhelmed with the food, one time recently and once just after they opened.  Pros: Free chips and salsa, good margaritas, good side salad.  The first time I got tacos al pastor and the pork was very fatty. I couldn't eat most of it. Similar issue with my second experience, ordering a chicken burrito. They don't trim their meat well at all. The chicken was gristly and sinewy and very hard and unpleasant to chew. Perhaps in their dishes where their meat isn't already cut, the food is better. But the other ingredients didn't make up for the poor cuts of meat. There are better local Mexican chains and restaurants I'd got to again before going here, for a meal at any rate, though for drinks I might stop in. Even places I've reviewed before and wasn't impressed with, as at least they aren't as pricey as Totopo."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm from Texas, where there are Mexican food restaurants everywhere.  I tried to ignore giving this place a review because it makes me sad and miss \"home\".  If I could give this place 2.5 stars I would have.  My husband and I were looking for a place to go that we could both feel like we're home.  We came here for St. Patrick's Day in the evening with full intentions of sitting at the bar.  The bar was unfortunately packed, which was a good sign that maybe the food and/or drinks would be decent.  They had a St. Patrick's Day margarita special.  I think it was a house margarita for $6. The venue was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Huge bar in the middle of the restaurant with seating behind it and in front of it.    Since we couldn't sit at the bar, we were seated at a table in the front of the restaurant, near a TV since basketball was on (gotta love March Madness!).  Our server was prompt and courteous.  We asked her recommendations, and she said the fajitas were extremely popular.  That is what we ordered.  We decided to try and split it, just in case we didn't like it.  When we asked if we could have an extra tortilla, there was going to be an up-charge of 99 cents. We ended up not getting it because the aren't made in house... Have you ever had fresh made tortillas?  LIFE CHANGER!!!   We also ordered a small queso for our complimentary chips, which was ok.  We definitely killed the whole thing. We got our house margaritas. They were nothing special - green for St. Patty's but I couldn't recommend it to someone I cared about.   Thank goodness we split the fajitas. We ordered the mix up (steak and chicken fajitas).  Both tasted teriyaki flavored or like a stir fry.  We didn't like it, and I could hardly eat one fajita.  It was disappointing. So, in all the restaurant didn't pass our fajitas test, and if I came again I would definitely have to order a margarita with a better quality tequila.  I could see this as a spot for drinks and chips - and that's about it."}
{"text":"It was good, but not somewhere I am wanting to go back to right away. We had a short wait as it was a busy Friday night, but the bartender was serving up good sangria and margaritas, so not a big deal. The service was good. I would say the food was nothing above average. The guacamole was made to order table side which I did enjoy!"}
{"text":"We stopped in late in the evening on a weeknight. The food was good, but it wasn't by any means close to the best Mexican we've ever had.  Chips and salsa were fresh. We asked if they had a hot salsa and they did (always a bonus!). We ordered the queso dip. It was pretty basic.   I also ordered a sangria (underwhelming and wouldn't get it again). My friend has a strawberry margarita. Again, basic. No complaints there.   In our group we had a variety of entrees from chimichanga to tacos to enchiladas. The food was good, but nothing really stood out that would make me want to go back."}
{"text":"I can in for an early dinner, as I walked in I liked the dim lights and the music that was playing. The atmosphere was really relaxed and I felt like I was able to relax. I started off with the beef nachos, which were some of the best nachos I've had in a long time. The presentation was great, everything  tasted fresh and unlike most places that are conservative with their sour cream, this place piled it on, which I love because I love sour cream. They were delicious. Then I had the grilled steak burrito which was fantastic, the best part about it was the house salad it came with. I don't know what the dressing was that came on it but it was amazing, I've never had anything like it, I couldn't put my fork down. As for the burrito, it was delicious. The steak was cook perfectly. For desert I had the fried ice cream, which came out looking like it belonged at a 5 star restaurant. It tasted incredible and fresh as well. My server, Juan, was great, very attentive. My drink never went low. He was very polite and professional. I recommend that you stop in if you're in the area. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot say one bad thing about this place!  Love their tamales, guac and their half price wine nights!  The staff is so friendly and we love going back for their great service.  I'm not a margarita drinker, but everyone raves about both frozen and on the rocks. Friends of ours loves the peach frozen margarita!"}
{"text":"These guys are in no way ready to go live on a Saturday night in Lebo! The good - salsa and the tableside guac. The bad: First, this place is as slow as molasses. We waited for a table at the bar at 5:45 and the bartenders were just ignoring patrons trying to get a drink before happy hour was over - uncool. There were literally 10 empty tables while we waited but clearly not enough capacity in the waitstaff or kitchen.  From being seated to receiving our entrees? An hour and 15 minutes - just to make two plates of food - three tacos and three enchiladas. The shrimp enchiladas, for $13, were supposed to have a \"creamy\" sauce but were drenched in a red sauce. I got perhaps four shrimp in total - no other filling in the enchiladas - and a scant tablespoon of cheese. The black beans, while very tasty, were mostly sauce - I'd say there were maybe 20 beans in the bowl. The house margarita was virtually a virgin drink - we had to buy sidecars of tequila to balance out what was otherwise just a glass of what tasted like sour mix. The second round (which we ordered with another sidecar of tequila) came with no salt. on the glasses. We were salting them ourselves with table salt. Our server was overwhelmed and undertrained. Once we were seated and our orders were taken she never brought water or offered us a refill on our drinks until we flagged her down 45 minutes later. When we finally asked for the check, two hours after we were seated, she said she'd like to buy us a drink to apologize for the wait (nice gesture) and I asked her, in lieu of having to sit there anymore, she could just comp our second round. She did, but did not comp the extra tequila that made the drinks balanced. Oh, and I should add, a server dropped an entire tray of food by our table and shards of broken plates flew everywhere. It took a good ten minutes before someone came out with a broom and she was so taking her time to fix it you'd have thought she was napping.  I hope these guys can get their act together - if not, I give them six months. A shame, because I was excited for this place but their menu (not imaginative at all) and service make them an off-brand Chi Chi's."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool- it's the only \"upscale\" Mexican place in the South Hills I know of, so it's a good option if you're craving Mexican food but want a nicer dining experience. The menu is seemingly authentic and more extensive than other Mexican restaurants in the area. I've really enjoyed their tamales, and their salads also are pretty good. As is typical with Mexican restaurants, the portion sizes are big and I always end up taking some home. It's slightly pricer than other Mexican places, but it makes sense given the ambience, which is usually the defining factor when I decide to go here over other places. I haven't tried their margaritas yet but I've heard good things about them"}
{"text":"I was back at Totopo tonight for dinner & it was awesome! Super friendly staff! The food is cheap and amazing! I started with tortilla soup and moved on to the grilled chicken burrito, which came with the most delicious side salad with a citrus vinaigrette! Just perfect!  I went for lunch @ Totopo which means tortilla chip in Spanish (I had to ask) and was really impressed. I was greeted by very friendly young lady who cheerfully said Hola :) The restaurant is comfortable, with a very authentic Mexican vibe. My waitress was very attentive and helpful. I felt the menu was very diverse and the prices are super reasonable. They delivered free tortilla chips to the table with salsa and I ordered a drowned chicken burrito - that had rice cheese, green peppers, onions, red peppers it was delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great trendy atmosphere, nice drink menu, and food awesome ..I was very pleasantly surprised!! The food was authentic, fresh, and so flavorful..and the weirdest thing is how inexpensive the meal was..a pick 3 with 2 sides was like 11$$ could easily charge closer to 20$$ and it would have seemed fair bases on taste and size..I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends last week when I was in town and I loved this place! Mexican food is my all time favorite and I normally know what I'm getting when I go (fajitas). However, I was so blown away by the menu at Totopo. There were so many different items to try, jicama chips, chorizo tacos, etc. Things that you may or may not be used to seeing on a traditional menu.   They also had some cool burrito bowl options which I always appreciate since I cannot have flour (gf).   I went with the skinny tacos which were wrapped in lettuce leaves that had mahi and chicken. I really loved the flavor, and although messy (which most lettuce wraps are) I still managed to pick all three up.   We had margaritas, which I loved the agave margarita. We ordered tableside guac - which was fantastic?, and all my friends enjoyed their meals as well.   Definitely,? a cute spot with a very crowded bar if you are looking for a fun night out,I'd?d definitely suggest this!"}
{"text":"Nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket. Plain entrees. Dry chicken in the tacos. Nothing special here. Actually comparable to Mendoza Express which is disgusting. The salsa was good. That's about it. Service was extremely slow and the managers are rude. We actually complained twice and the manager just kept arguing so I gave up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been there a few times. Everytime the food is great and the service is fast. I love the spicy shrimp bowl they have and the fajitas! The flavor is incredible and the pricing isnt bad at all. Parking is easy and it is family friendly!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a few times. It is always delicious! The service is fast and friendly. Never any complaints about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about Totopo!!!! The wait staff was wonderful and attentive. I got a chimichanga that was fresh and delicious. My boyfriend also got tacos and really enjoyed them. The salsa is also very fresh and tasty. They get bonus points for a solid hot sauce selection too! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I loved it. The house mojito is delicious, the service was really friendly and the food was fantastic. We ordered the al pastor tacos and I was hooked. The rice and beans had a nice flavor without competing with the entrees. We also had the cilantro lime chicken tacos and I was equally as happy with those. They are topped with guacamole and it makes for a really fresh tasting taco. I'm excited to go back."}
{"text":"Insanely good, fresh Mexican food! The table side guacamole and queso with chorizo is to die for.  The staff is incredibly friendly and works so hard. Great place for families and for date nights."}
{"text":"Now given that this restaurant just opened June 1st of this year, I think they are doing an amazing job! One thing is for sure, that this place is a stand out on Washington rd from the rest. The atmosphere is relaxing, festive, modern, and they have plenty of seating. However, after 5pm they get busy and is usually a wait.     Today we arrived at 5pm and were sat immediately. They sat us in a booth where we were able to look at the restaurant and bar. Our server, Enrique, was very nice. He was able to guide us through their menu, as it was a tad overwhelming. The drink menu was extensive. And being that we were there before 6pm we were still able to enjoy happy hour, that included $1 off drafts and half off margaritas!     Tonight I ordered a cup of corn soup. That was delish! If you light creamy corn you would defined enjoy this soup! Add some hot sauce and it's awesome! The choriqueso is an app. It is a cheese fondue made at the table with peppers and beef. This was very good as well! We also had the chicken fajitas. The fajitas portion was huge and can defined be shared! Just ask for extra flour tortillas. For desert I ordered the fried ice cream. This was also very big in portion! It was the Mexican way fried ice cream. With the vanilla ice cream rolled in a cornflake, put in a fried looking desert tortilla and topped with a mountain of whipped topping. Very yum!    Overall, a win. Very happy with this place. They have outdoor seating, a back dining room, a bar to sit at while you wait for a table, great and friendly servers and hosts. Thumbs up! Not a thing negative to say this visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both love coming to Totopo! I definitely recommend ordering the chips and guacamole appetizer. It is made right at your table and they will ask if there are certain ingredients you would or would not like added, which is super nice. The pick 2 and pick 3 menu is where I typically order from, since you get a variety of choices. Also, the fiesta rice and casa side salad are super delicious. I never leave hungry!!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for happy hour on Friday evening. We ordered two rounds of margaritas and several appetizers. When we asked for the bill, we discovered that it included one too many margaritas. My father brought it to the attention of the bartender. The bartender disagreed and told my father the bill was correct. He proceeded to argue with my father, and point at me, indicating that I drank 3 margaritas, rather than 2. Despite being wrong, he continued to argue with me about my margarita consumption. I understand that happy hour gets busy and it's easy to lose track of customers, but I've never been to an establishment where the bartender has argued with me about a bill.   Overall, the appetizers were tasty and the margaritas were well made. The 3 stars reflect my disappointment in customer service at the bar. A family of 4 enjoying an evening out doesn't warrant an inquisition about one margarita."}
{"text":"Tableside guac. All I really need to say. Amazing. Since you probably want a more substantial review than that, The queso is great. Taco tuesdays have become a weekly thing for us and we love this place!!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family, everyone loved it! Kids friendly restaurant. Good food, very reasonable prices, great place overall!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a wonderful experience! Ivan was spectacular. His attention to detail and sense of urgency was great! The food... We had the table side Guacamole!! It was delicious. One of the gentlemen from the back came out with a table and made it right in front of us. Great overall experience! Very polite employees that are doing a phenomenal job!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am so happy we decided to try a newer Mexican restaurant in the area.  As soon as you walk in the atmosphere is authentic and welcoming. The decor is colorful and lively. I truly felt like I was at one of the resorts we stay at in Mexico. This made us excited for our meal immediately.  You get chips and salsa when you sit down. I decided to change things up and get a Mojito because they had multiple flavors to choose from. We also got queso. (If you check in on yelp! You're queso is free!) The drinks and appetizer were both delicious.  For the main course I got a combo of enchiladas, a chicken taco and rice. I must say I LOVE the portion size here. At most mexican restaurants they just give you too much and I feel horrible wasting it. Here it was perfect! My combo meal filled me but I cleared my plate. Both the chicken taco and enchilada were made correctly- and came out quickly even with how busy it was.  Our server was amazing. His name was Joel. He was quick, efficient, and friendly. The food runner brought out my husbands meal wrong at first and as soon as Joel saw he ran over and knew what was needed without even checking. He also recommended us a delicious tequila shot! You couldn't help but smile when Joel was around. Great work!   We honestly did not want to leave. I cannot wait to come back to try a frozen margarita and some fajitas! They also have different specials running every night so check those out too."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Totopo and it won't be my last. Delicious!! The restaurant is nice and welcoming. The service was outstanding. Everyone was so nice and we were never without chips or dips. To start, my friends and I split the dip trip. The queso is white queso and amazing. The guacamole is also outstanding. They also have table side guacamole that I  definitely will be getting next time. The table next to ours got it and it looked really yummy with all the fresh ingredients the server was putting into it. For the main course, I ordered the chicken tacos with refried beans and rice. They had just a little chorizo underneath and the meat was flavored beautifully. My one friend got the steak fajitas and I definitely coveted those bc they smelled terrific when the server brought them out. My other friend got a pick trio. They have the option of picking two or three items and making your own plate. She got a few different tamales and they looked really good. I also ordered the enchiladas Rojas to take home to the hubby and he devoured it. He said that they were amazing. I also can't forget the delicious margaritas. Fresh and the perfect amount of citrus. Loved it! I can't wait to go back and try my items off the amazing menu!!"}
{"text":"Nice place for mexican. We ordered a topo changa , chicken taco , taquitos and shrimp enchilada. Everything turned out perfect except for the shrimp enchilada which turned out to be too sweet for my palate. Will never order that again. Overall i would surely come back to this place for mexican food but would stick to ordering the taquitos and topo changa only."}
{"text":"Well Uptown has FINALLY received the Mexican restaurant it has needed for so long!!! Totopo (Aztec for chips...) opened today. Stopped in for lunch and the place was already busy without so much as a balloon launch or spotlight in the sky. I was promptly greeted by a super friendly staff person who sat my party down in the festively decorated bar area. I ordered a 'pick two' combo (could have picked three but not that hungry) option. One has a choice of tamales, stuffed poblano, etc. etc. I ordered the tamales southern style and northern style with cheese. You also pick two sides so I had a cilantro rice dish and black beans w/ cheese. Everything was fresh and amazing. The black beans were clearly NOT from a can but the good dried variety. My friend ordered the chicken tacos and they looked awesome/authentic. Other friend had a grilled chicken burrito and he was very happy! Everyone received free chips and fresh salsa. Looking around I see a whole bunch of other meals I need to try. Oh, and they have a pretty amazing happy hour from 4-6p... Between this and Jade Grille I will never go hungry along Washington Road!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Best salsa ever, everything was fresh. Staff is friendly, and restaurant looks great! Prices are really reasonable!"}
{"text":"Happy hour here is amazing. Margaritas, food, and chips / salsa are all on point. Nice to see some new Latin flavors in the area"}
{"text":"As an Angeleno on Mars, this place was a great surprise. Excellent guacamole, salsa and chips and the girl bartender who suggested I'd be satisfied with her house margarita, my most often go-to drink, was correct. The food delivered around me was well-portioned and plates were empty when they were bussed away. Reasonably priced, and clean, it's a good place to have a drink without a crushing scene. It's a low key but friendly vibe. I returned the next day for huevos rancheros for brunch. The eggs were cooked perfectly, sauce a little on the salty side but edible. I'd definitely return on my next trip to Mars."}
{"text":"My first trip to Totopo was a happy impromptu event. The margaritas, food and service exceeded my expectations. I've been back multiple times and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Yay! A yummy Mexican place in Mt. Lebo! I came for lunch with my boyfriend and we started the meal off with a free quest dip! Check in on Yelp and get a free queso or guac! We ordered the chicken chorizo tacos and the al pastor tacos.  Each order came with 2 large tacos and a side of rice and beans.  We each swapped a taco so we could try one of each and both kinds were delicious! I don't know if I could chose a favorite!  Our meal wouldn't have been complete without margaritas, so we also partook in the Saturday marg. special for $7 a piece.  Totopo is definitely a quality Mexican restaurant and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The combos are definitely the way to go. You get a lot of food for $8-$10. Highly recommend the enchiladas roja and the quesadilla. The queso dip was a great appetizer for a great price. The regular chicken taco was lack luster, just nothing special about it."}
{"text":"I was meeting my friends for dinner and we wanted to try this restaurant because it was new. I LOVE Mexican food. In fact this was my 3rd time this week for having Mexican food for dinner. I was psyched to try it.  When we got there the place was packed. That's impressive for a Thursday night. Of course it's new and everyone wants to try the new place. We were seated quickly. We were given a table by the front windows. They had them open because it was such a nice night. We started looking at the menus and chatting. It took over 15 minutes for someone to come and take our drink orders. About the same time someone else brought us chips and salsa. For 4 people they brought 2 baskets of fresh made chips and two small dishes of salsa. It was very good. It also gave us something to snack on until our drinks came another 15 minutes later. A half an hour to get something to drink is ridiculous. We didn't even order anything from the bar. It was soda, water, and tea. The waiter took our order and we started chatting. There are big TVs everywhere. We watched the pirates lose and then watched the hockey game start (Game 5 of the Stanley Cup). We chatted and did some catching up. I didn't time it but it was over half an hour to get our food. It was probably more like 45-1 hour but I'm being generous and saying at least 30 minutes.  It was rather confusing because there were 2 guys & one chick working our area. We weren't really sure who out actual waiter was. We had to flag one of the 3 down to get refills on our drinks. They got one of our orders wrong. It was completely wrong. One of my sides was wrong. I didn't send it back but it was frustrating.  I had the Chicken and Lime tacos. It had chicken, guacamole, lime and cilantro rice and shredded cheese on two corn taco shells. I don't know what it was but something on the tacos was super sweet. I wondered if they had added sugar to the guacamole or rice instead of salt. You couldn't taste lime, cilantro or guacamole-just sweetness. I ate my side of beans to cut the sweetness.  We flagged down a waiter for dessert menus. He kept telling us they were on the menus at the far end of the table. We kept telling him they weren't. Finally a friend picked one up and showed him. Then he said, \" Oh, they are on the other menus.\" and walked away.  About 20 minutes later he came back to see if we were ready for our checks. We told him that he never brought us dessert menus. He went and got them but by that time we just wanted to leave. It was amazing the lightning speed in which he gave us our checks and brought us our change.  We never complained about anything except my friend who's order was completely wrong and even then she simply said, \"this isn't what I ordered.\" (In a very nice way.).  The whole experience was disappointing. I did taste my friends Enchiladas Verde and they were excellent. Poor service and food that tastes more like dessert than dinner it what got them 2 stars. I hope as they are there longer that their service improved greatly or people will not come back."}
{"text":"My family wanted to try a Mexican place that we had never been to before so we tried Totopo in Mt Lebanon. Off the bat it was great...our server, Marco, was very attentive and kind. I had a Yelp coupon that got a 4oz guacamole for free if we checked into the restaurant on the app so I did that and I could immediately tell the manager was not happy I used that coupon. Then my child's meal came and while my daughter was eating it we found a long black hair in the rice. I called Marco over and showed him the hair and asked for a new meal to replace the soiled one that was delivered to us. He apologized, took the plate and when the manager brought the replacement meal out she didn't speak...no apology...just dropped off the plate. Of course while eating we were cautious with every bite after what we saw from that point on. The whole time while we were eating the manager glared at my wife and I to the point where it was uncomfortable. We finished our meals, got the check and ended up being charged for the  guacamole AND the meal with a hair in it. I asked Marco to fix the bill due to our coupon and hoped that upon second look we would also leave without paying for food that had hair in it. The corrected check came back with the kids meal still on it. I didn't want to cause any problems for Marco so we decided to leave our first visit to Totopo and make it our last."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good experience for my first time at Totopo. The chips were fresh with the perfect crunch, and the salsa was a manageable mild. I decided on the cilantro lime chicken tacos (served with rice and refried beans) which were pretty spot on. I also got to try the fish tacos, and those were even better!  But the real winner was the mojitos! I would come back to Totopo solely for their mojitos, they were THAT good.   They also seem to have really great daily happy hour drink specials."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here on Friday we wanted to try a New Mexican place and it was about the same distance from both of us. Almost every time I eat at a Mexican place in Pittsburgh I am not impressed but Totopo definitely impressed me. I got the shrimp enchiladas and cilantro rice and beans. It was so good everything was perfect the rice was so soft and tender. I usually never eat the rice that comes at restaurants since a lot of times it can be dry or over cooked. Not here though it was perfect. The restaurant was fairly busy because it was Friday but our food came out extremely fast. I also got the complimentary queso which I definitely would order again. For drinks I got a house margarita which was half off since it was still happy hour then I ordered a drink with rumchatta and horchata In it both drinks were fantastic. I want to come back and try more thing on their menu! They also have outside seating!"}
{"text":"First time there, as they have just opened 3 weeks  ago. (June 1, 2016)   Asked to be seated in front an open window, and the host happily seated us there.  Took maybe 5 minutes to have waters brought to us. drink orders took a little long too. Chips and salsa were brought to the table and were excellent, great salsa, little bit of a spice but delicious. The waiter and rest of the staff's interactions were all in good spirits and helpful.   The Happy Hour specials from 4-6 everyday were impressive; half off drafts, house margaritas, and appetizers. The house margarita was tasty, lime and citrus flavored, though didn't seem to be made too strongly.   Food time, the dip sampler is a great start. Guac was smooth but a little underwhelming in flavor. I prefer Chipotle's to theirs.  Queso dip is always tasty.  The food was decent, but I think most Mexican places food is all pretty similar. Specifically here, the chicken was tough and dried out.  Beef had a good flavor though.    Overall a nice place to eat in Mt Lebo, which a market that hasn't been tapped yet there.  I think it will do well, especially if the staff speeds up getting food and drinks to the tables in a timely fashion. but it's a new staff so hopefully with time that is improved.   I do plan to be back for happy hour and dinner again!"}
{"text":"Had the guacamole which the make fresh right in front of your table.  I could have used a little more lime in it but still was great.  I went with the combo burrito and quesadilla. I like it but wouldn't put it as best I've ever had.  Give it a try as they are better than most!"}
{"text":"Wow Totopo is four times as big on the inside than it looks on the outside! Went last Friday nite for dinner, only a 10 minute wait. We got seated in the back dining room. If you're looking for a very family friendly dining spot where it is so loud you can barely hear your spouse, and there are many loud screaming babies, this is your spot! Good for families/ friends, not a good date spot. The food was delicious and next time we will get it as takeout!"}
{"text":"I was not very impressed. There is much better Mexican food available in the city. I got a shrimp which had a sauce that was not bad, but really not very good.  The table side guacamole didn't really have the right balance of flavors. Out of 4 people I think only one person truly loved their food. Worst of all (ok it wasn't that terrible) but they squeezed 4 people into a high-top table that really just wasn't enough room! They should get bigger high tops if they plan to seat groups of 4 at them! Otherwise they should discuss this with the customer first...we didn't get the option and it seemed a little rude of them."}
{"text":"Second visit & the staff is just so great. The food is not bad but can they please just do something about the tort chips? They need to make them fresh on site. Otherwise, they're just cold & stale. The opposite of what you want chips & guac to be!"}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars - great prices for lunch ($8 for a substantive two-item combo), and a nice range of side-item choices, including a tasty house salad.  Didn't have drinks, but the drink menu looks creative.  Such a good addition to Mt. Lebanon - worth visiting multiple times!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to! Food is delicious and presentation beautiful! Great Service! Can't wait to come back and sample some Tequilas"}
{"text":"Grilled burrito with chicken. Little flavor. Bland. Chips were decent, but should've been thinner. Good service."}
{"text":"We came for late lunch on Mother's Day.  It was Sunday, so there was ample free parking in one of the garages.  The front and bar areas were quite filled, but we didn't wait, and were seated in a booth in the rear.  Our waitress was helpful and offered us free mimosas for the occasion.  The drinks weren't weak on alcohol, despite being of no extra charge, and had bits of fresh orange in them as if made from scratch.  The only unusual things was that we weren't automatically given water upon being seated, though it was offered when the appetizer came.  We ordered the spinach queso dip, which was made tableside and was loaded with spinach and rich, cheese flavor.  The 3 of us ordered from the combo menu (pick 2, plus 2 sides for $12/plate).  The food was simple, packed with the right amount of heat.  It says a lot that none of us used the bottled sauces to add to the dishes!  The salad had a sweet cilantro dressing...i loved it. The chicken posole was the soup of the Day, and had some heat and was loaded with hominy, although the chicken was a little tough.  The black beans and refried beans tastes much cleaner and well-seasoned than most Mexican restaurants, in my experience.  We had a lot of dishes loading down our table, and they were bussed away pretty regularly.  All in all, out bill was $54 for 3 including one $5 bloody Mary, not including tip.  We weren't really looking at prices, so we were pleasantly surprised that we were able to enjoy so much authentic fare (without bean fillers displacing quality ingredients) at such a reasonable price.  We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, excellent bar! Nice hang out! (This post service wants me to say more... Why???)"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic restaurant! I love Mexican food so I've had plenty ranging from terrible to awesome and this restaurant is definitely up there.  The chips are average but the salsa is really good and the dip sampler we got was a great call. For my entree I got the drowned burrito and be warned...it's HUGE and delicious!  The service was also great and the atmosphere is perfect for friends or family. Overall, no complaints - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A new favorite! A detailed, carved wood hostess stand and warm colors welcome you. My friend and I chose a late lunch on a Saturday to try Totopo and both were completely satisfied with the choice. Quick and friendly service. Our server was a little hard to hear; a soft talker but attentive. We ordered the tableside quac to go along with the chips and very tasty salsa. The quac is definitely suited for four people but we nearly polished it off ourselves because it was creamy and fresh and prepared with just enough of each ingredient that not one of the flavors overpowered the other. My friend ordered from the combo menu (enchilada and mushroom quesadilla) and I ordered the fish tacos. Hearty portions at very reasonable prices. Washed it all down with house margaritas. In my opinion it beats Emiliano's hands down."}
{"text":"As with most casual Mexican restaurants, very reasonably priced and good authentic food. Nice bar specials throughout the day also not just at happy hour. The yelp app provided great freebie in the form of fresh guacamole which was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican in the south hills ! The food was amazing and the portions were large !!! Great prices didn't hurt either . I'll definitely be back ."}
{"text":"Have been to Totopo a couple of time in the last year with friends and family.   Have to say they have improved service and time to get your food from my last review.  We have had a couple of different servers that were very professional, good and there to check on us.  On our last visit on a Saturday night we were quoted a 25 to 30 minute wait but it was about 10 minutes.  We ordered drinks and they come out in reasonable time.  Before our drinks arrived we were served fresh warm chips and salsa.  My Mahi Mahi tacos were cooked perfectly and tasty with sides fiesta rice and refined beans that were good.  Should probably come for happy hour some time."}
{"text":"The service is always quick, the food is always good, and they usually have a couple beer/drink specials going on. We've gone many times and never left disappointed."}
{"text":"Totopo has the best queso around. Great margaritas. Sometimes a little loud and hard to hear."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to dining in the South Hills!  We went for lunch (with a BOGO coupon!) and enjoyed every bite. Definitely try the queso dip for a starter We tried beef tacos, an enchilada and both black & refried.  SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I returned  for a full meal, and it was wonderful. We were seated promptly and greeted warmly. The server did explain that the only margarita made fresh by the glass was \"El Jefe\", so I ordered it. A little sweet and orangey for my taste, but that is just my preference. My partner ordered  chicken and chorizo, which was served in a molcajete with a side of aalad, rice, tortillas and beans. Outstanding! I had a combo of chile relleno and enchilada verde. It was perfect. Ingredients fresh, spices and flavors were distinct, and the servings generous but not in a ridiculous way. We will definitely be returning. Bienvenido a Mt Lebanon, Totopo!"}
{"text":"Having frequented Totopo quite a number of times now,  I thought an update was in order.  The food itself is great.  We've not had a single item placed in front of us that we didn't enjoy.  The issue at Totopo is the service.  I think that nearly every time we've visited, we have had to send at least one item back to the kitchen for not being what was ordered (ex: chicken burrito was served instead of the beef burrito that was ordered).  On the one visit that the food order was correct, we were missing an item (a complete kids meal) and had to wait for the server to stop by the table and remind them and then wait for the forgotten meal to be made.  I would have thought that the staff would have found their stride by now, but it appears not.  I'll revisit my review if the service improves."}
{"text":"We often go to Totopo as it is always good food and service, reasonably priced.  They do a great job and everyone who has gone there has always had good things to say. Tableside guacamole is the best anywhere!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is wonderful and always attentive. It's busy, but we never have to wait long. (We are usually there on a Friday or Saturday night) Chips and salsa are awesome.  Fish Tacos are my favorite. The veggie Fajitas are very good too. Also can't beat their margaritas (on the rocks) One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is a cumulative review. We love this place. Tonight was the fourth time I have been here for dinner. I don't know why I didn't review this place earlier. First, as soon as you sit down, chips and salsa arrive. We always get the table side guacamole to start. We ask for extra cilantro and extra lime juice. It is the best! We've tried the tacos, tamales, burritos, chimichangas, and more. We've never had a bad meal. Margaritas are also great-I like them with the Corralejo tequila.  My only tiny complaint is the refried beans are sometimes only luke warm."}
{"text":"We are life-long Texans who just recently relocated to Pittsburgh and have been desperately looking for decent Mexican food. This place fills that role for us! The service left a little to be desired (our order didn't come out correctly despite us being the only patrons in the dining room). There is also room to improve on some of the details, like the chips and taco shells obviously not being made fresh in-house, but overall the quality of the food is excellent. My tamale tasted authentic, the salsa is the best I have had so far in Pittsburgh, and the enchiladas were great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh!  Authentic Mexican food.  The Al Pastor Burrito is incredible!"}
{"text":"Totopo is currently my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Ive had the majority of the menu and haven't had anything that wasn't exceptional. Many Mexican restaurants are heavy on the cheese and oil but Totopo is always fresh and light while having generous portions. They have awesome margaritas as well and I enjoy the regular weeknight specials."}
{"text":"This is something Mt. Lebanon really needed. I recommend the table side guacamole and the Lime Margaritas."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends tonight for a wonderful evening of food and fun. Disclaimer- not usually a big fan of Mexican food and don't go out of my way to eat it. Let me say loud and clear, I will be back NEXT WEEK and every week after!  Unbelievable food, great value. Get the tableside guacamole (and I usually don't like guacamole) and be prepared for the freshest, most authentic cuisine! Another STRONG recommendation - make a reservation for dinner on the weekends. We had one and were seated right away. I heard the wait without one was over 1 1/2 hours!"}
{"text":"Average Mexican, more \"chain-like\". Their house marg is pretty good and hh specials are cheap"}
{"text":"I decided to stop here for lunch after having seen it was finally open. When I entered I learned they had been open for a week now. They have free WiFi which always comes in handy and I was seated immediately. I noticed that they do have outdoor seating but on a rainy day I prefer indoors.  They offer a Sunday brunch menu but I found the best deal was a build it yourself option. For $8.00 you get a choice of two entrees whether they are tacos, burritos, etc and a choice of two sides. Among these sides are two different choices of rice, two different choices of beans, or a side salad. If you want three entrees then it is $10.00.  I decided to order two different soft tacos-one chicken and one beef along with the side salad and black beans. Each table is given a bowl of tortilla chips and salsa which is a generous portion.  I got my meal and thoroughly enjoyed it. I found the salad just a touch spicy but I had enough drink to wash it down. I was able to chat with folks at a nearby table where they had ordered a bowl of guacamole for dipping. The lady there told me it was just alright but I didn't get to sample it.  It is true that the service is slow but I always thought that if it is prepared the way I like it then it is worth the wait. However, when my waiter brought me my check, I asked for change and later found out he shortchanged me. I drew that matter to his attention and he corrected it saying \"I thought I told him to keep the change.\" He must have seemed confused.  I also learned that even though there are vegetarian options given on this menu, some of these items are not vegetarian. The lady next to me told me that about the beans. I enjoyed my black beans and thought they were very tasty.  I'm allowing some latitude to the fact that they just opened and probably have a lot to learn. A second visit in the future will help me determine if they make these improvements. They have a full bar with TV sets all around but it wasn't overly noisy. Totopo is located on Washington Road in the Mt Lebanon business district near the indoor parking garage. When I asked if they validate parking during the week, the host told me he wasn't sure."}
{"text":"Food is very good, but... 1) way too loud, and 2) waitstaff disorganized.  Dropped an appetizer order, then, after after reminded twice, delivered it at the end of the meal...and charged for it. A restaurant that might want return business a) wouldn't dump the missed app on the table so late and b) would comp dessert or something."}
{"text":"Tried Totopo during their first week open. The food was good, but the server was overwhelmed. Prices seemed reasonable, and I look forward to trying Notre of the menu."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back, which is the best review one can give. Taco Tuesdays is the bomb! Recently we tried Totopo and we loved it , On taco Tuesday you have the opportunity to choose any taco on the menu for 3$. My partner and I each tried three different ones and they all were amazing. When using the yelp app you also have the opportunity to download a coupon for free guac,delicious. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Terrific place, right off the hop the salsa is very tasty. Had the chipotle chicken entree wife had the Choripollo Asado. Mine was delicious hers was amazing. The house margarita is done right. Tequila, lime juice, ice garnished with an orange. I may have ordered two....or three!"}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight for the first time, I ordered the Pick 2 with chicken Enchilada Verde and a beef burrito. Refried beans I'm always a fan of, however my second side, the Fiesta rice, was excellent! You can't eat the burrito with your hands because it is covered in sauce and the chicken in the enchilada was a bit dry. I'll definitely be back to try more on the menu with hopefully a giant bowl of that rice!"}
{"text":"Not sure what it is about their tortilla chips but they're addicting. Order yourself the dip trio -you won't regret it. Visited for a friends birthday on a busy Saturday and the service was good -attentive and nothing got screwed up even with 8 people. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food was tasty and lots of it. Side salad is a good size and delicious! Will be going back."}
{"text":"Not your average Mexican Restaurant. Lovely decor and bar.  There are many tables and a separate room for possibly groups.  Meals are served on heavy plates and no paper napkins here.  Cloth is a step above. Really outstanding menu with well prepared dishes.    Friendly service by Morgan who was so efficient, I will be asking for her on my next visit.  And, yes I plan on coming here often.  Before our chip bowl was empty, but with smaller chips, Morgan appeared with a loaded bowl of fresh chips.  There are many options on the menu I want to try.  I like the veggie options and the lettuce wrap tacos.  The jicama chips are freshly cut sticks of jicama with a savory dusting of a spice.  The build your own is a good concept.The guacamole is made table side if you want the large portion  A YELP check-in will score you a choice of a small guac, or queso.    They do a Happy Hour from 4 to 6pm.  A discount of $1 on beers, half price house margaritas and half off appetizers, except the guacamole.  Parking along the street can be a challenge but a small public lot is not far away on a side street."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Great service and yummy food. So glad it's here!"}
{"text":"Authentic food that's absolutely delicious. Great service and really nice staff. They have great lunch deals too! Worth trying out. Everything is fresh and so tasty!"}
{"text":"It just opened and is pretty good. The service was lacking but maybe that was due to it being so new. The guacamole and salsa were very good but the chicken and chorizo burrito was just average. Their mixed drinks were also below average.  The atmosphere is nearly unchanged from when it was Walnut Grill with a few Mexican details scattered about. They did have the Pirates and Penguins game on, which was nice. I'd probably go back but it's not worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Walked in for happy hour on a Friday around 5 and was seated instantly. Were then greeted by a pleasant waiter with chips and salsa. We decided to just get a couple of their house margaritas and some shareable appetizers. The food came out quick and was delicious. Great experience, will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"No doubt this is the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. We ended up there on a Saturday night just by coincidence and our experience was wonderful.  Service is great, music is cool, prices are ok, and the food is very well prepared and presented. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"There's the average Mexican restaurants, and then a step above the rest that is...Totopo. From the atmosphere to the wait staff to the food. Speaking of food, come hungry. If you overdo it on the chips and salsa, there won't be any real estate left in your belly for all the delectable deliciousness. The Pick 2 or Pick 3 options gives you the most variety from classics like enchiladas and burritos to the rarer menu finds like tamales, with both Northern and Southern styles available. It's also one of the few places in the Pittsburgh area that offer seafood-based tacos, such as grilled shrimp or fried cod. Every meal comes with a your choice of sides, but I recommend the customary fiesta rice and beans (and this is coming from someone that doesn't really do beans of any type!). This is simply a great addition to the Lebo food scene on Washington."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about Totopo, and I feel like it's just good.  It's not fantastic, and it's not bad.  Anything I've had there has had really good components, but the rice and beans on the side is always lacking.  They're just rice and beans.  Nothing special about them.  Now, I will say, the table side guacamole and the choriqueso appetizer are both fantastic, but nothing else has wowed me enough to trek up to Lebo.  Little Tokyo?  Absolutely.  Totopo?  Eh...  Side note:  the margaritas that come out of the machine are LIGHTYEARS better than any cocktail I've had made by the bartenders.  I feel like that should be the other way around.  Sometimes, all I want is a margarita with patron silver, triple sec, lime, and a few orange slices, without salt.  Everywhere I go, bartenders are perplexed by this.  Why?  It's the simplest margarita ever.  Ok, the hipster bar only knows how to \"elevate\" their everything, but I should DEFINITELY be able to get that in a Mexican restaurant.  sigh"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch this week and was very impressed! If you're familiar with the area, it's in the building Walnut Grill was in. The atmosphere was very casual, and the staff was extremely welcoming. We sat a table in the general bar area, and as we were being escorted to our table, the bartender very warmly welcomed us to the restaurant and made us feel very appreciated.  Our server/s were very attentive, and definitely seemed to be genuinely interested in us having a good experience. The food was outstanding. We ordered the table side guacamole, and it lived up to the hype! The flavora were excellent, the ingredients used were fresh, and was a perfect addition to the complimentary chips and salsa.  My friend and I each ordered different tacos so we could try one of each: the pork and the chorizo. They are served traditional street style on fresh, doubled up corn tortillas. Both were excellent and full of flavor! The accompanying rice and beans were actually really good. Often I find the rice and beans to be mediocre at best at other restaurants... But here, the rice was bursting with flavor and the refried beans were incredibly tasty.   This was a wonderful surprise as yummy, quality, authentic Mexican is hard to find. I plan to not only return here, but to tell my friends about this place too!"}
{"text":"Ordered the taco salad and it was definitely different than expected and had way too much cilantro dressing on it, I couldn't finish it."}
