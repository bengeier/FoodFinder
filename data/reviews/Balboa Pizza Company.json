{"text":"Haven't been here in at least 6 months cuz the service was horrible...waitress (not the horrible one) remembered what I eat...impressive or they have my picture on a dartboard in back! The food however is excellent as always!"}
{"text":"WATCH THE MENU, WHAT YOU GET & YOUR CHECK!!

First (& last) time to Balboa--Husband regularly walked past the place & wanted to try it. Went on a Friday around 5:30 p.m.--not unusually busy when we first arrived, but it was a holiday weekend. Waitress was \"perky\" & quick to bring our ice teas ($2.50 each. Ordered Fish & Chips ( 3 pcs. cod, Maui Waui fries & Cole Slaw-- $11.95) and (3) Beef Sliders--menu choices of \"California, Cheese, Cajun, Ortega, or BBQ. Served with Maui Waui Fries --$10.95. 

I chose CHEESE sliders & when the plate arrived, there were 3 mini burgers with homemade potato chips sprinkled with a dry cheese.  The chips were lukewarm, dry & tasteless.  The sliders, however, were great. 

My husband's meal consisted of 3 decent sized pieces of batter fried fish, set on top of a pile of french fries with a scattering of onions and crispy looking jalapeno pepper slices mixed in, plus a fry dipping sauce & a tartar sauce. He said the fries with the peppers & onions were \"interesting\".  

Our waitress checked on us after we had barely had our first bite of food, but then we never saw her again until it was time to bring us the check--& that was when I noticed an ADDITIONAL $ .75 charge for the Cheese on my Sliders!  What!??!!  I got up to retrieve a menu & saw that my sliders were supposed to come with the Maui Waui fries--NOT the sawdust-like \"chips\" I had been served. 

When our server came by, I pointed out that we had been charged extra for the cheese & it was clearly stated as one of 5 flavor choices.  I also mentioned that my meal had been served with chips & not the Maui Fries as was stated on the menu. She became somewhat defensive & said she would take the charge off for the cheese, but it WAS usually an extra charge.  She also stated that the fries were \"an ADDITIONAL $2.00\"--otherwise the sandwiches came with the chips like it said on the menu. What!?!  The menu SAID the sliders were \"served with Maui Waui fries\"--NOT the Balboa Island Chips as the sandwiches had.  Well, no arguing with this one, for sure. 

Clearly, there is a problem with how the menu items read and how the staff interprets what comes with something, & what is considered to be an \"extra\".  Hopefully, someone from Balboa's \"Pete Kaufman Establishment\" will read this review & spend some time either correcting the menu or training the staff.  But as a consumer--Pay Attention!!

Otherwise, you may be paying extra for something you thought was part of your meal."}
{"text":"Walked by this place hundreds of times the last 7 years and last night, I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!!!  From the atmosphere to the food...even on a Friday night with large tables (including my own) the wait time to receive our food and drinks was beyond reasonable. 

Ordered pepperoni pizza's, chipotle wings, and some fry/jalapeño concoction...pizzas are rectangular and thin, about the size of my 17\" laptop. Although cheesy, the crust was cooked through, soft (not soggy), and fresh. The wings may have been overcooked, but not dry. I didn't try the fries because I am not a fan of jalapeños. 

I like there are two entrances: from the store front & parking lot. 4 stars because the restrooms were disappointing & needed a tad more attention. Instead of taping a handwritten sign to the wall saying \"wiggle handle,\" maybe have it fixed?  2 sensor faucets, and only 1 worked."}
{"text":"As a frequent customer I must say that I generally love Balboa. I have had nothing but great experiences with most bartenders there with the exception of Laney who is rude, unattentive, short.  I always try to avoid coming in there at night as that seems to be when she is always working."}
{"text":"Balboa has been one of my favorite hangouts since I moved here about 3 years ago. It's open 24 hours AND it's in Henderson, which makes it a popular hangout. The pizza is amazing (I get bbq chicken EVERY time). I also like how on spring/summer nights, the bar will open to the outside patio and you can just hang out with your friends and have a few drinks. The servers and bartenders are always very friendly and helpful. Their Maui Waui fries are AMAZING as well...highly recommend those. My friends and I find ourselves making pit stops here after long nights out, and we want to get a delicious pizza and sober up with some glasses of water and lemon."}
{"text":"Went here today. The food was decent as always. Still isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's not the worse. I enjoyed the food. The biggest issue I had though was the service was very bland. I don't think I saw any of the waiters smile or anything. If they were to be a little more lively and act as if they enjoyed their job I'm sure they would have more people in there. Will go back but not rushing back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise going into and eating at Balboa Pizza Company.  Is a cozy nice restaurant in The District in Henderson. Started off with a house salad that we shared. It was shredded lettuce, with basil, nuts, chopped tomato, and a hint of dressing, just hit the spot.  We each had a rack of ribs.. best I have ever eaten... it puts all the BBQ places to shame in LV and Henderson.  The ribs were so meaty, sauce was great (I am not a big BBQ person but this was outstanding) and under the ribs were the french fries. Mr had the fries with onions and jalapenos, and coleslaw with pineapple.. wow more great food. Service was terrific, never had to ask for refill on the great fresh brewed ice tea.  Highly recommend this place.. They do offer daily specials--Tuesday bogo pizza/Wednesday 1/2 off full rack of ribs.. We WILL be back."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is great. The people are so friendly and I had the best service fro Andrea. She was so nice and funny. I really liked the atmosphere and food. I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"This place has a fun casual atmosphere.  We were in a very large party, and they handled us extremely well. The server was able to keep track of who ordered what and split checks extremely efficiently. 

We had the Maui fries and they were delicious.  We also had a pizza that was good, but it was on a thinner crust and it got a little too soft in some places. We also had a California wrap that was quite good. The onion rings were great as well. 

There is also a full bar and we had several rounds of drinks. I drank wine which was both good and not terribly expensive, and my husband had a few mixed drinks. One came in flat but they were more than happy to replace it for him."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza I've had.  We ordered the Sundried Tomato & Spinach, Artichoke Heart w/ Roasted Garlic Cream Sauce - DELICIOUS.
The Hawaiian BBQ wings were very good too.
Decor was very \"beachy\" - that's a good thing.
They do have TV's in every wall, so if you in for watching sports, it might be a very good choice."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. We tried to take 25 people after a baseball game for a players birthday. We called before hand and the person that answered the phone placed me on hold then came back and said no don't come here your party is to big.... we will never go to this resturant... besides refusing business the receptionist was completely rude and the manager would not even speak to me......."}
{"text":"The wings are amazing! Pretty good deal on happy hour specials! The menus are like news papers and are a little beat up at times but it was a creative idea."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to eat and drink. Great atmosphere and selection of beer and wine. 

Customer Setvice
1) Outstanding customer service and fast food preparation. They had our order of 2 pizzas and full rack of ribs before we could finish our apatizer. Our server was friendly and very accommodating.  I was very impressed , customer service alone would be a reason to return.  

2) The Food
The ribs were absolutely outstanding!!!!! They are the best I have had in years.  This place gives Louisiana and Texas BBQ Ribs a run for the money. I highly recommend the ribs!!!! 

3)Price
The price was another great thing about this place. It was amazing how much food ,wine, and beer we had and was less than $60. 

I have made this one of my favorite places to eat ribs and pizza."}
{"text":"Wasn't too bad.  I see why it has 3 stars though.  Tables are sticky which to me is super gross and its a lil too pricey for what you get, it was $15 bucks for an 8x12 or so flatbread pizza with 1 topping...ugh.  Prob won't go back."}
{"text":"I had the spicy sausage and mushroom. Not much meat though the pizza tasted good. Mostly dough and cheese. Everything else seems fine. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"24/7! Can't beat it. Very nice wait staff, excellent pizza! Didn't try the wings, but I was told that they were good as well. Usually very busy around 4pm to 9pm or so. Walking distance from the Green Valley Resort. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The ribs are delicious!! They are flavorful and fall right off the bone.. Good deal for a full rack. They have video poker, full bar and juke box, and a great variety of food. And best of all... they're 24/7!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Balboa. I called ahead to order take out. The pizza was ready when I arrived. I had the tomato basil pizza and it was really good. The crust was perfect and didn't even get soggy after taking it home to eat. I'd had the pizza once before and it was delicious that time as well. The prices are fair and similar to other restaurants at The District. The service was good too."}
{"text":"Holy freaking cow! Pulled Pork. Pizza. Colesaw. Yes.

Really really good food with a killer tuesday night special. BOGO! I seriously loved the unique pizza they had and the price is very reasonable for a BOGO tuesday night. I gave it one less star simply because of the pricing on normal days would be considered \"high\"."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account just so I can make this review. The service here was unbelievably bad. This wasn't the first time I've had bad service here  which also compelled me to create my first Yelp review. There was a group of at least 5 servers/hostesses standing talking to each other while we were the only ones waiting to be seated. My buddy had to ask to be seated after waiting while they leisurely conversed after waiting for a very reasonable time. They seemed uneasy about us asking just to be seated as well. The whole time our server was giving us a mean attitude. I asked for a water not knowing another friend of mine already said \"4 waters please\" and she gave me a look saying \"he already said 4 waters.\" When she came back with the water my buddy asked \"what's good on the menu\" and her response was \"pizza.\" Keep in mind this was not in a joking tone. I know what a joking tone sounds like I'm a millennial who browses comedic internet videos all day. We then decided to leave and didn't want the risk of getting even worse service. I will never make the mistake of coming here again."}
{"text":"I love Balboa's. They have a small dining area with very friendly staff. There is an outdoor patio with bar service via an open window section. Happy hour drinks are awesome and the pizza pretty gourmet for the price. My favorite is the artichoke and roasted garlic pizza. The crust is thin and crisp the white sauce savory and the toppings sweet and somewhat tart. Great balance. 

It's very casual and during off hours a quiet place to meet up with friends. It does get a little crowded during the peek hours. Even busy it's worth a try. I give it a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We love their chicken chopped salad with basil & candied pecans. And the jalapeño fries are good too. I'm not a huge fan of the pizza, but my husband really likes the buffalo chicken one. The crust is too soggy for me but the flavor is good."}
{"text":"The service was ok, in that they didn't just ignore us.
The pizza was sub par, however. The crust was rather soggy and lacking in flavor. You expect a crispy crust in a thin crust. Not even close. 
By husband and I paid over $50 for 2 individual pizzas, 1 beer and a serving of chips and dip. No desire for a second visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We came in with our kids for a bite on a Saturday evening. The place wasn't particularly busy and the waitress did bring us the requested beer and water, but then we waited for. 45 minutes for her to return to take our order. She visited the tables around us flirting and talking and any time we stopped her she told us just a minute and disappeared again. Eventually we had enough and my husband went to pay the bartender. He did comp the beer when he say how disgusted we were."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight.  Won't be in a rush to be back.  Food was just okay.  I had Jamaican jerk wings and my wife had a regular pizza and salad.  Not a lot of flavoring in the food, I need flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place, they have one of the best BBQ chicken pizzas in town. Sometimes the service is a little off, but I don't care much as long as my pizza is hot and in a timely manner. 

It would be absolutely amazing if they delivered, but I love this place either way."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza. Also really great ribs and chopped chicken salad. Really great go to place when you're at Village Walk in The District."}
{"text":"beware! this place sucks! the first time we went here my hubby and i got massive diarrhea from the food that we ordered. idk if it was the pizza or the burger or maybe even both. anyways, we went in again for dinner last night to give it a second shot. well, we ended up standing around for a while to be seated. the female bartender and a few waitresses saw us but failed to mention that we could take a seat anywhere. we ended up sitting at a table and waited another 15 minutes. the place did not look busy at all and there were several waitresses just standing around doing absolutely nothing! the bartender kept staring at us so we were hoping she would send someone over to give us our drinks and take our orders. but nope! nada! guess we were wrong! she just continued to stand around and chit chat with the servers/waitresses. im really disappointed with this place. the workers here are rude and ignorant! i hope the owner of this restaurant sees this and does something about it aka fire his entire staff and get workers that actually provide some type of service!! if i could give this a no star i would!! we are never coming back to this so called restaurant. the food here was shi**y and the service is beyond terrible! they probably serve expired s#** and/or do cross contamination so caution to anyone reading this review- you have been warned!!!!!"}
{"text":"I worked there when I was a teen, I loved it! The food was always good, the staff was always nice. I went back there a few times after I stopped working there and it was always great!"}
{"text":"This place is like my second home these days. I just moved to Green Valley and my roommate and I enjoy beer and food (of course) so we decided to hit this place up and we have been numerous times thereafter. 

The pizza is pretty good. I actually like the garlic chicken white sauce pizza over the regular tomato sauce pizzas. The pizza with marinara tastes way better cold for breakfast then it does hot. That is just me. However, their sliders are delicious. They have this pita pocket club sandwich that is also bomb. I think I still have a few more dishes to try but I have been through the menu almost and it is pretty good. I love how the menu is on newspapers. 

They have special nights occasionally, like rib nights, or karaoke nights.   You just have to be on the look out for those. 

I like this bar and I will probably be there again soon. (We dont cook much)"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Balboa Pizza last evening. The chopped chicken salad and the spicy chicken salads were great. The ice cold orange flavored beer was very refreshing :-)

Our waiter, John, was simply amazing. Balboa is very lucky to have him. John was very attentive and extremely professional. He checked on us often and even took a picture with us. The evening was great. Thank you Balboa Pizza:-)"}
{"text":"Meatloaf sandwich, fish n chips Southwestern sandwich... All three of us were pleased. Fries taste like my mom used to lovingly make from scratch!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a afternoon cocktail!
Lanie, Kerry, Eric are the best! Good food also...,"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome staff! Great place for locals to hang out"}
{"text":"so I am a regular known by everone at gvr and surrounding restaurants after midnight felt like some fish and chips so I went to Balboa saw there was a new bartender usually throw them $20 so they remember me next time I asked for a water and waited for him to come back and take my order guess he was too busy talking to his friends, so I got up and said well I guess you are too busy I will go somewhere else. so he starts yelling at me and follows me out the door and says don't ever f$$$ing come back.... Listen I am nice to everyone this guy is a total loser I do not even know his name...and believe me I know everyone and will share this story...it was early Wednesday morning..i am the oldest one in the restaurant that sat at the bar..review the tape and believe me I will never step foot in Balboa again...."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here many times before and it's been consistently good but the last few times the pizza has been way off. We just picked up a couple pizzas tonight hoping it would be better but it's the worst one so far, just disgusting. One was three cheese and the other was a Philly cheesesteak. The 3 cheese was just barely ok; overdone but given the fact I was starving it tasted alright. The cheesesteak was GROSS the sauce was watery, it wasn't cooked evenly, the cheese looked weird on some places on top like they put cheese squares on top before putting it in the oven and lastly, they didn't even bother to slice it up. If I wanted one giant hunk of pizza I would order a calzone! I'm posting a picture,  you'll know it when you see it. By the way don't expect to get your money back if your food sucks. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"the wings werent bad, but the pizza rivaled Grimaldi's.  Perfect patio, average priced beers, decent atmosphere, and good service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I sat outside on a very hot day and it was just so-so for me. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and was hoping for more flavor. (See picture) 

The waitress was very friendly, very helpful when ordering. Always there when we needed her and we were the only ones on the patio so that was nice. We also had our dog and they immediately asked if he needed water which is was a sweet gesture. 

Honestly, I can't speak much for the inside of the place and the pizza - two parts to Balboa that I'm sure are important! - so I will have to update when I go back again. My husband got the meatloaf sandwich and house chips which he really liked.

Just A-OK for now, but nothing is stopping me from going back so I look forward to it."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss with the service. Sometimes you wait 2 minutes to be greeted by the waiter and sometimes you wait 10 minutes. Pizza is good, but Pizza Rock is better."}
{"text":"must try the homemade chips, and jerk chicken wings! The pizzas are pretty good too if you are into the California style pizza. I would have given this place one more star if the server I always get wasn't so cold. I'm not really sure if she is rude or just socially awkward."}
{"text":"This was a great date night.  We entered through the District interior, so it was a little intimidating. You have to walk down a long hall before you actually get to the restaurant.  Be brave, it's worth it!!  Really yummy food and extra strong drinks.  Pizza was terrific and I can't say enough good things about the teriyaki wings.  The buffalo chicken wrap was okay, but the bright blue long island iced tea more than made up for it.  Service was pretty good, maybe not spectacular, but all in all, a wonderful time.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Awesome...must try the fish and chips...broke da mouth..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today after shopping in Anthropologie.  I had a half size BBQ Chicken salad.  It was really good.  Even the half size was pretty big so I can't imagine what a full size would be like or who could eat the whole thing.  I ate about half and took the rest to go.  Waitress was nice, food was good and prices weren't bad at all.  Would love to come back and try some pizza next time!"}
{"text":"These bartenders do not take care of there gamblers . We gambled $80 and they took 1 drink off of our bill . Service at the bar was horrible also . Food servers were awesome . Really need to change the bartenders ... We will no longer come to this pizza spot !!!"}
{"text":"We visited Balboa Pizza because we were in The District and I had a coupon. Good thing, too, because the prices are one or two dollars more than comparable items at other restaurants. This may not seem like a lot extra but it does add up.

At any rate, the dining area is small and there is no separation from the bar. So, if you want to talk to the other people at your table or have small children, do not visit on a game day. Other than that, the place is nice.

I had the All American Pizza Bread Sandwich (minus the roast beef and mustard but I added 1000 Island Dressing which I had not requested but was included on the plate) with french fries and a side of ranch dressing. The sandwich was great and the fries were good plus the portions of each were very large. My problem was the extra charge for fries instead of potato chips and the charge for the ranch - especially since I did not have the roast beef or mustard on the sandwich. I understand that the ordering system is all computerized and additions add to your bill while deletions do not deduct but and extra $2.50 - really? 

My husband had a pepperoni pizza. He said is was nice (as you know this is a compliment from him) and there were plenty of leftovers. The toddler also really enjoyed the pizza and fries.

Now, for the service - really not impressed. I am not sure if there was only one waiter or if the other server was so sneaky that I did not see them until the end of our meal. However, even if there is only one server, the dining area is tiny and he should not have had a problem taking care of the tables that were occupied. We had to flag him down for drink refills. You know this is a pet peeve of mine. He was busy cleaning all the tables around us with his head down, not glancing over to see if we needed anything. He was pleasant enough, just not very attentive. 

Overall, the food was good and the slow service was not a deal breaker. The prices, however, could be an issue. I do have a couple of more coupons so we will return and on Tuesday they have a 2-for-1 pizza deal which I will try. If you happen to be at The District, it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Best. Wings. Ever. I come here at least three times a month. On occasion, I've been known to come here more than once a week for weeks at a time. I freakin' love these wings. And I've eaten A LOT of different wings.

Take my advice on this one: when they ask what you want, just tell them this exact phrase: \"24 wings, spicy, extra well done.\" (Their hotness ratings go Mild, Spicy, Wild, so Spicy is actually medium.) The key here is the \"extra well done\" part. The wings come out perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside (without breading or frying!) and the insides are still moist, not cooked totally dry. 

The wings themselves are very good, and are just the right size. Not too small and with plenty of meat, but not those giant mutant wings that seem to have come from Hulk chickens and never cook right.

The appetizers are all great also; I frequently get the house salad (which comes with delicious walnuts!) and I *always* get the Chip Trio. Best part about the Chip Trio: the chips are made in-house every morning and come with a garlic ranch as one of the 3 dips, along with the cheese and onion dip. The garlic ranch is awesome with the wings, which typically come out with standard ranch instead.

This place is also open 24 hours a day, which means that regardless of the time of day I can come in and get the best wings in town. Which is freakin' awesome.

As a final note, I don't eat pizza much these days given I don't deal well with gluten, but I used to, and the pizzas here are absolutely up to the standard of the wings as well."}
{"text":"This could be the most scathing review I've ever given. 
If I were the manager, I'd be embarrassed. Nothing is clean - table was sticky, the condiments hadn't been moved for not sure how long, lots of stuff behind them...don't get me started on the Womens bathroom. 
So, maybe I'm judge mental about a place based on the general state of repair of the facility and how the team members behave. So, the wall sconces are all cock-eyed and crooked. The floor was really dirty. The white canopy over the booths needed a fresh coat of paint. The only smile I saw was the bartender. The busser and my waiter never once smiled. 
The beer was great! 
The food was ok. I had the lemon chicken Greek salad. Flavor was good. The chicken had a texture like it had sat in the marinade a little too long and was more like Goose liver. 
Overall, I had to give it a two. Lots of room for improvement at this establishment."}
{"text":"I've been here for over 3 years, but rarely go to the District.   That could change now.

Anyways, I went here for lunch a few days ago, and it was really good.  It's a 24/7 gaming place, but you wouldn't know it walking in.  Not smoky and not too noisy.  However, we went at noon, so that could have been why.

The food was delicious.   I had a buffalo chicken sandwich with pizza bread instead of regular sandwich bread.  It was a little messy, but it was really good.  It came with these potato chips that had some type of cheddar seasoning that were good, too.

I'll definitely go back.  Service was good, atmosphere was nice.  Of course, the location is great."}
{"text":"i have been here once before last year and enjoyed the homemade chips with three dipping sauces while sitting under the outside palapa in the rain all the while sipping on a cocktail or two. Good times. 

Tonight.....not so much. When my group entered after running some errands my first impression was sloppy as there were a multitude of tables that had been not cleaned up.

Service was mediocre.  Please introduce yourself and if I appear totally confused by all means offer suggestion to the menu.

Ordered up the chips and they were delicious.

Settled on two different kinds of pizza.  One being the chicken and roasted garlic and the other was the pulled pork.

The chicken and garlic was so so and absolutely the better of the two.

The pulled pork was some sort of Frankenstein monster of a pizza.  The pineapple was odd and I should have my head examined because even though it said it had coleslaw on it, I ordered it anyway.  Bad idea.

That one became just a gooey mess that after it went in the take home box it was thrown away in a dumpster in the parking lot.

I did however receive a free Sprite.  When it ran empty it was filled up with water.  It's replacement was pure carbonated water.  It took awhile for things to settle down.

I don't know if I put the waitress out or if I should have continued drinking the Sprite now turned Perrier?

The reason I ask, is that a completely different waitress handled the bill situation.

So mush for the what little rapport we had with the previous waitress.  I almost wanted to lash out with pen as I calculated the tip having felt abandoned.

But then I remembered the mix up of drinks where they glass of Sprite became mine and instead looked at it as a random act of kindness...15% on $40...done.

With Yelp as my sherpa I will take the higher road.

This one going on the LIst of Woe.  Probably for the best as I have to start hitting the gym."}
{"text":"I am no expert in the world of chicken wings, having only tried them one before a few months ago at Hooters casino, but, with that as my comparison Balboa rocks. Whatever they were called, the medium sauce was just perfect, just the right amount of hot. The wings..... far, far better than Hooters could ever imagine serving up. The wings rock. Even better, (Friday night) the wings were .50 each, and draft miller $3 and out waitress (Samantha) always there with a smile,"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar waiting for friends and the bartender was prompt and awesome. We ordered a pizza and chips and it was not good. The pizza didn't have any flavor and the chips were very ordinary... super disappointed."}
{"text":"Balboa's is our Go-To place for dinner.  The restaurant is located in a great location in the District.  It's always kept clean.   Even though they have gaming inside, it's smoke free!  In the cooler months, they also have outdoor patio seating.  The waitstaff is always friendly to us.  Maybe we go there way too often and they recognize us...  but still great service from the beginning.

This is by far my favorite place to get my Cobb salad.  It's huge!  I usually can't finish this gigantic meal!   The grilled chicken has great peppercorn seasoning (which is also on the bacon).   

My husband always orders the spicy chicken wings.  He absolutely loves them.  They have a great flavor.  Plus on Mondays the wings are 50 cents each.  I think there is a minimum of 10 for an order but still an outstanding price! 

Other menu items we have tried are the sliders, chip trio, flatbread pizzas and southwest bean dip.   Everything we have eaten here is awesome.  Plus their french fries are fried with onions and jalapeños.  It really gives it an excellent kick and wonderful flavor.  

Balboa's is open 24 hours which is a bonus!  We love it!"}
{"text":"First few visits in this restaurant and it was fab!  I initially just wanted  a place to get a light lunch near GVR and picked out Balboa after I checked and saw their menus served up a variety of different foods from pizza, wings to ribs. 

So far I've had the Chinese Chicken Salad. There are two sizes regular and full size. The regular size for me was huge, enough to feed 2.  Served not in a salad bowl but a platter mind you.  Can't imagine how much what the full size salad looks like, but regular size is plenty enough.  The salad had fresh and crisp napa cabbage, bok choy, cilantro and diced scallions. Every bite had pieces of white meat sliced real thin,  juicy mandarin oranges throughout added some sweetness, the yellow & red bell peppers gave it a different twist but the flavors all blended well together. The dressing is some kind of vinaigrette. Peanuts mixed in too and topped with chow mein noodles made it one pretty crunchy and pretty tasty salad. So good that I ordered it again when I came in for lunch with my husband.

Bucket of Balboa Chips that our server recommended was also a winner. They were also served up still fresh like they just deep fried them. I read it was fried in Canola oil and it's sliced pretty thin, so I don't feel too guilty having  a few slices of carbs. 

I didn't try any pizza, then again I hardly ever order pizza when dining at pizza establishment. (odd but true!) But they had a different variety of pizza combos. Mr. B had their Tostada Pizza, thin, crispy crust and good combo of meats, not too spicy.  Pizza was shaped rectangular served on a wooden cutting board. Good size serving too. He approved of it. 

Service was spot on.  Greeted and seated right away.  Servers on times we went were friendly. My lunch order came out quick. NOTE: If you're entering from the door from the courtyard area you'll have to walk down a long corridor to the main entrance. The main entrance is located on the parking lot side facing Paseo Verde. Love how the interior has beachy touches to it, reminiscent of the west coast beach houses with a laid back vibe going on. All that's missing are the waves. Love that's it's open 24/7 and  see why now this is a go to place for lunch and the after work crowd. Very cool!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday. Their goat cheese pizza is really good and I ordered the calamari which is okay but it was just extremely greasy. The red sauce that came with it was literally frozen. I asked for another red sauce and the new one they gave me was frozen as well like what. Their service isn't the best either with their waitresses not being the nicest."}
{"text":"I went here twice.  First, I came on a Monday night to sample their 50 cent wings (I tried the Hawaiian BBQ sauce).  It was good enough, but it tasted a little dry and plain.  The french fries, however, were delicious.  I ordered them plain and they were incredibly tasty.  So I gave it another shot.

I came back on a Wednesday because they had a full rack of ribs for half off.  Once again, it was good, but it tasted a little dry.  So be sure to ask for extra sauce of your choice regardless of what you order.  With the extra sauce, the ribs were great, and the price can't be beat.

One day I'll actually come back to sample their pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times the food was great and service was good and quick. I recommend the Maui Waui fries (the sauce that comes with them is delish), the wings are better than the \"Buffalo\" chain hands down and pizzas are good. Tonight we tried the wedge and it was a lot like a personalized calzone. Seating on the patio is nice."}
{"text":"My manager called to ask if they had chicken fingers and they said yes. Then he asked if it came with fries and the lady on the phone said \"yes\" (he put her on speaker so I heard it). When we got there to pick up the order I double checked if the order came with fries and I was told no. I was really annoyed for the confusion but decided to order the fries anyways to ensure my manager was happy with his food. Regular fries are $8 same price as Maui fries, both options are less than ok. Del Taco has better fries and wayyyyyy cheaper. I asked Joana for ranch and ketchup and she gave me one of each. I asked if i can have one more of each and she seemed annoyed. In the bag there was no forks, napkins or good food. By the time we got back to the office the food was cold. $30 for a chicken fingers, fries and a side salad. No thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious, one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"I typically do not like anything that refers to \"Californina Style\" however, in this case of Balboa, I make an acception. Balboa Pizza has excellent pizza and the staff is fantastic. I'm getting hungry and am craving some Balboa Pizza as I write this."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here for about 6 years. Try the calamari - it's different, but by far my favorite!!! I also love the chopped chicken salads and the shrimp tacos. Fresh, delicious food and awesome bartenders. Love it!!! Don't change a thing! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"I've somehow by accident become a regular at this place.  Just simply a brilliant restaurant and bar tucked into the Green Valley Ranch District.  It is open 24 hours, and for night owls like myself and friends it makes for a great place to go and hang out late at night and eat and drink.  They have friendly service too, which helps when being a regular.

Personally, I love the two for tuesday deal on their pizzas.  I've ordered their pepperoni almost every time and am always satisfied.  The buffalo chicken was okay, I felt the lettuce on it was a bit much.  The caprice was also a good menu choice, offering fresh mozzarella and a good sauce.

Their chips are wonderful, and I'd highly recommend them as well.  They come with several dipping sauces, such as jalapeno cheese, which elevate them from a commonplace item to a unique staple.

The drink prices are a little steep at times, so I wouldn't recommend drinking here all night.  But for what it is, they have a good selection for the late night crowd.  They have a banana nut bread beer which I'd also recommend trying just out of pure strangeness.  It's like bread in a glass.  

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for an afternoon lunch with my husband. Located in the District at Green Valley. What a find, delicious menu and very friendly waitstaff. Nice ambiance kind of like a beach side cantina.

The onion rings are some of the best I've ever had. First of all they are huge!! They could be a meal just alone. They use sweet Maui onions which make them mild and delicious. The coating/batter is crusty, sweet and full of goodness. They come with BBQ sauce for dipping but we requested garlic ranch dipping sauce to go along with them. The Garlic ranch complemented them better than the BBQ sauce.  

My husband had the wings, they were meaty and juicy. The sauce they were tossed in was spicy and tangy (medium). Excellent taste!! Went really nice with the cool ranch dressing and celery sticks.

We shared the Caprese pizza. The pizza came out on a cutting board cut in a square pattern, topped with goat cheese, garlic, spring baby lettuce mix, tomatoes, and topped with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Delicious!!

The bar offered a good selection of cocktails, and also had some local craft beers. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and service by Cheyanne!  Good red wine for great value!  Awesome place open 24/7!  Great music!  Trifecta!"}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the service is the food! I keep saying I will never go back but the location and patio are inviting...tonight was the final straw!"}
{"text":"For a midnight craving you need to stop by Balboa and get your food groovy on. The late shift Scott will take care of you! The food and service was awesome.  I give this place a five star and believe me im a very picky person when it come to pizza... love it love it love it'll..."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here on my first night on a recent Vegas trip. They have good IPAs on tap, service is stellar, and the buffalo wings were a star on the menu.

Of course I ordered the pizza. To be more specific, I ordered the pulled pork pizza -- which was served with cole slaw on it. You're thinking, whaaat? Slaw? Well it was damn delicious. Very fresh taste and all thin crust, which I highly enjoy. I was so hungry after my flight I drvoured the entire thing in one sitting. I encourage you to do the same."}
{"text":"First visit here a few weeks ago was decent. It was after midnight and just a few customers at the bar. Tonight's visit was horrible. Waited outside for over 20 minutes without even being looked at. Waitress completely ignored my \"excuse me\" for help. Walked back inside to the bar and let the bartender know the patio was lacking service. He acted like we offended him and blew off our heads up. Ordered a beer and a shot and closed our tab. Other customers also came up and complained about the drinks. We were ignored until we left."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times since I've moved back, but I use to hang out here all the time when I lived here before. The few times I've been the food has been just as good as it use to be.

This is a great little find for such a chain restaurant heavy shopping area. The pizza is always good, though not knock your socks off good. Just good. I do love their Maui Waui fries, which are this yummy soft fry with onions and jalapeno served with a mayonaise sauce that is tasty. I've had quite a few things off their menu and always enjoy it.

The service is pretty good as well, but nothing super friendly. You'd think a guy would try to talk to a single woman at the bar, but not really. The bartenders just chit chat with the servers and only come over when they see your drink is low. I miss bars where the bartenders tried to chat with you, but we are in Las Vegas.

The atmosphere is laid back and relaxed and they have a fantastic patio if you can stand cigarette smoke. I can't so I sit inside, which is rather disappointing on nice days, but that's not their fault. 

All in all I like this place, but it's somewhere I tend to forget about when I'm thinking of pizza. If I'm in the area and craving pizza and wings, I'd stop in here, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Balboa is a great gaming bar with a focus on sandwiches, pizza and delicious appetizers. I have had wings, buffalo chicken sandwich, wraps, pizza and a few other items and have never been disappointed. The location is right next to Green Valley Ranch without paying casino prices. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, let's start off by saying that.  I like their food but there is nothing over the top about it.  It is bar food but with a slightly different attitude.  I know the atmosphere is that of a surfer lounge and that is what the food is reminiscent of.  The food is good and quick but in my book, too expensive for what you get, both portion size and taste.  The same goes for their drinks.  

I will say though that the best thing about them is that they are open 24 hours so if you are craving some food late at night that isn't just fast food, go here.  If you're stumbling around The District needing food to sober up, go here.  The atmosphere is inviting and it has the plus of being in a really nice area so you don't feel unsafe walking around late at night.  During the day it is pretty crowded, as most of The District is, but late nights are just walk in and give your order to the bartender, easy as that.  Oh and they have daily drink specials and happy hours, so check that out if you are interested.  I say definitely check it out; you honestly have nothing to lose."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last weekend. My husband asked the waitress if the jamaican jerk chicken wings were sweet or spicy and her response was eeh. He then asked her if they were hot and she again respnded eeh! The service was terrible  and we probably wouldn't go there again. $4.00 for a draft beer is a bit much for the during the football game special. Pizza was okay but not that great."}
{"text":"Yesterday evening my father and I went to dinner at balboa. It is one of our fave places to go. I absolutely love the barbecue sliders! They are so well made and the fries are delicious! Yesterday while dining our server was Tanner. I just have to say he was extremely attentive and friendly. He made sure my glass was always filled and even noticed that my order came out wrong before I did! He made sure to get it back to the kitchen and had my new order out in minutes, I wasn't complaining though because we had onion rings as an appetizer so I was already pretty full. My dad and I appreciated his service so much especially after he mentioned he was the there until 3 am the day prior and at work at 8 am that day, by the time we sat down for dinner it was already 6 pm. I know if that were me I would be pretty grumpy but tanner never let that show! 
My dad told his manager and complimented him directly! 
Such wonderful service and of course we will be back!"}
{"text":"Our group had made reservations several weeks in advance of our company trip to Las Vegas ..upon arrival the restaurant seemed surprised to see us coming in even though we had a reservation.

The waitress seemed friendly enough from the onset however she began to run herself ragged with our group and her other tables. She forgot to bring some of our drinks of which we had to remind her and also forgot to put an order in for one of the members of our party. She had delivered the check already before she realized that she had forgotten to put the order in.  Rather than take responsibility she blamed the cook and said that he forgot to make it and rather than comp it or have a manager come over to the table to assist us she took the check back and added the meal into it. It also took her forever to get refills on the drinks and she brought over a Coke refill for one of us  which obviously the syrup had run out as the glass looked like seltzer water with a tiny bit of brown in it. The food itself was just okay the buffalo chicken sandwich that I had was cold, the chips were good, the maui fries were greasy and soggy. Also of note is when the appetizers were delivered we had no napkins or silverware so one of the members of our party got up to get napkins.

We are a great group and we always give amazing tips for servers however it just didn't warrent it on this visit to this particular restaurant it's unfortunate because we were looking forward to lunch here.But the restaurant just didn't seem to be equipped for the party even though we have made reservations weeks before and this is very disheartening.

Should we visit Vegas again we definitely would not eat here. Two stars."}
{"text":"Every once in a while a place will have a menu item that just calls to me and I have to give in to the urge. For us, the Chicken Pine Nut Pesto Pizza is IT at Balboas. Other stuff might be just ok, but they have GOT it on that one. Husband is on his way to pick one up for dinner along with a straight Pepperoni and Sausage. Service has been good and to go works great, they are even doing curbside since my husband is recovering from a hurt foot. Looking forward to dinner yum!"}
{"text":"I was first impressed with their menu!.... How cute is it to have a paper menu in style of a newspaper? ... You know they replace these often , which is a good sign because menus that are laminate never get clean and germs Galor. So it was nice having such nostalgic menus, very creative in my opinion!

Anyways on to the important stuff THE FOOD! ...  Our first appetizer was Balboa Chips with 3 kinds of dip (Onion, Ranch and Jalapeño ) Just the first glance at it after she laid it at the table I knew they were going to good, I was excited to try it because it look so good! My favorite dip was the ONION, first chip that landed on the tip of my mouth and i got my first bite I was like OMG.... yum. To think this was just a starter , how was everything else going to turn out???

Next up our Chicken Caesar Salad! You would think that salad is an easy dish, but a lot of restaurants FAIL, especially when it comes to the most simplest kind such a the Caesar. But Balboa Pizza did not fail , their salad was amazingly so FRESH , and by fresh I mean theres a CRUNCH to the lettuce. The dressing was not overwhelming and instead of crutons they had wonton crisps which actually made it super good with the super fresh crisp lettuce. YUMM

Alright, so far IM IMPRESSED RIGHT? Well on to the main - THEIR PIZZA! . We got a vegetarian pizza ... and oh my my my my my -..... I was doing the happy dance  and there was a PARTY in my mouth... So AMAZINGLY GOOD!!! I LOVE IT... Im a fan of the flatbread style, you can taste more of toppings. i love love loved it, i could eat a whole pizza slab to myself!!!

This was the best place I have ate at so far in Vegas with my loves....
Oh and the service was good too..

we also had fries - but not much to mention there.

but overall i am VERY SATISFIED - going to bed with a happy tummy :)"}
{"text":"Tuesdays are BUY ONE GET ONE FREE on their pizzas so that means you got to go there today. Their pizzas are a decent sized thin crust and are topped with some very delicious ingredients.  If you come in a group you can pretty much try them all.  I don't remember them all but enjoyed the one Misti Y mentioned in her review, goat cheese, walnuts, balsamic, arugula. Straight plagiarized LOL. They also have pizzas like a sun-dried tomato with spinach and artichoke hearts pizza and spicy tomato and basil pizza.   And don't forget their tostada pizza.  I'm loving the rest of their menu which includes wings and their various flavors like chipotle BBQ, Jamaican jerk, whiskey BBQ, some BBQ ribs, salads, and pizza bread sandwiches.  Sounds like I'll be back soon. 

I liked their surfer beach theme and enjoyed the atmosphere. 

Located in The District and walking distance from the GVR and near by businesses."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever

I wanted to like it, it looked so good. I got a thin tasted like cheese and crackers my daughter got the kids pizza more of a deep dish it was raw. Can not believe pizza is their specialty. I told my waiter that we didn't like it but she said that all she could do was take off $3 half of the price of the  kids pizza. We will not be going back"}
{"text":"I came here to try their pizza. Was not a fan of the pizza at all. There are so many better options for pizza in Las Vegas. But they have an array of other options besides pizza. I had the wings, those were actually really good. The wraps, sandwiches and salads were big sized and actually pretty good. So, if coming for pizza, I don't recommend. But for a variety of food and a cool bar atmosphere, not a bad spot."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for wings, hands down! 
Balboa to me has the best wings in town. I always order them spicy and extra well done. They're never under done (like some places I've been to) and they have a great flavor! 
In the mood for wings and beer? This is your place!"}
{"text":"Food is always good, although I didn't care for the pizza bread. Service on the other hand is 50/50. Either it's awesome or, like today, crappy. Stay away from Jade. She's got a bad attitude. We were her only table, and had to wait a long time for refills. When we left, the other waitress, told us to have a nice day, and Jade just stared at us like we were from outerspace."}
{"text":"Bad service hurts pretty good food. 

The turkey reuben and chips with garlic ranch were very good. The pepperoni pizza was pretty good and the wings were pretty standard buffalo wings. The fries were not worth the $2 upgrade however. 

The service was what really brings it down. From taking forever to take our orders to completely ignoring us so that we had to go to the bar to get our drinks refilled it was all bad. 

Decent food plus bad service isn't a good first impression. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried the crispy shrimp tacos and it was delicious! You can order shrimp grilled as well. Plate had 2 tacos and tri-color chips along with different salsas. It was $12.99 which is a little pricey, but it was worth trying."}
{"text":"Love the fries here as well as the variety of pizzas you can order. It has been a tradition that after boating in Lake Mead during the summer that we meet here to hydrate and stuff our mouths with delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Usually I come here late night because it is open 24/7! 

They have great food and are conveniently located near the bars. 

Their salad is incredibly good and so is there pizza!"}
{"text":"Came in for the Tuesday 2 for 1 pizza deal.  We started with the Chips Trio, and Chicken Wings.  If you are thinking of ordering chips to start, the trio is the way to go.  You get one each of their dipping sauces, onion, ranch and jalapeno.  Hubby enjoyed his wings.  They have several sauces to choose from.  For the pizzas we ordered a Three Cheese, Pepperoni, Garlic Chicken and BBQ Chicken.  Service was slow but food came out fast.  The pizza is more of a flatbread but its good!  We all really liked it.  Kids gobbled theirs up right away and you can't beat the price.  Great place to take the fam for an inexpensive dinner out.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of their other pizzas."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummy! I used to live on this side of town and visit ALL the time. Now that we live 30 min away we don't come as often. However, we just got lunch today and it is amazing as ever. They employees have always been super friendly and fun but if you think that's great, the food it even better (and that's tough here since the people are so amazing)! Best wings in town, I literally CRAVE these things... Wish I still lived across the street but I take advantage of any chance I get to visit and grab some grub"}
{"text":"We had the Chinese chicken salad and a pizza. Both were great as were the beers. Service was quick and attentive. Loved the slightly laid back environment. Great location too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Balboa has long been a regular haunt for my friends and I due to the casual and comfortable atmosphere, drink selection, and menu. It's open late and is typically a great meeting place to start or end the night, if you're feeling those hunger pains around 2am and just really need a buffalo chicken pizza for the road. OR, it's a great place to grab some lunch when you're out shopping at the district, or to watch the game on a Sunday with some friends. I've always liked the food here, my favorites are the bbq chicken pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, cobb salad, lemon chicken greek salad, and maui wowie fries."}
{"text":"The food is great.  I really like the chicken fingers, Maui Wowie fries, and pizzas.  The service varies from 3 stars to 5 stars.  Some of the staff are really awesome and some are just ok.  They are a bit pricey but you can count on the food being good.  If you get something to go be really careful to check how it's packaged.  They aren't good at putting the tops on the sauces and after a 2 mile drive home both cartons had the sauce soaking the food.  And why would you package blue cheese or ranch with hot food?  Just put it in a different box."}
{"text":"I come here for one reason and one reason only. 2 FOR 1 PIZZA TUESDAYS!

From 4 pm to midnight tuesdays you can buy one pizza get another free! For every pizza you have to purchase a beverage but I think it's still a good deal!

I have tried every one of their pizzas and I gotta say that my favorites are the Caprese and the Tostada!

Caprese - Has Goat cheese, spring mix leaves, garlic, and balsamic vinegar.

Tostada - Has spicy ground sirloin, sausage, refried beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, black olives, cheese, sour cream, guacomole, and cilantro.

All pizzas are served on a flat bread thin crust which allows you to savor all the flavor that the pizza has to offer. 

The appetizers are fabulous as well. I usually get the Maui Waui Fries with shrimp or the Calamari.

Maui Waui Fries with Fried Shrimp - For just two bucks more, you might as well get this option instead of the fries themselves. You actually get a decent amount of shrimp. As for the fries, they come with grilled onion and jalapeno slices.

Calamari - Deep fried to a golden crisp with not a lot of batter so you get more of the fantastic squid that tastes good with the marinara sauce that comes with it.

From what I heard, their hot wings are awesome as well judging by the orders that I have seen on other tables. 

Service is phenomenal and I can vouch for it because I have been here at least 4 times. That's pretty good considering I live in North Las Vegas. All 4 of my visits I have yet to complain about anything! 

Some random info: They are open 24 hours. Since they are right across the movie theater, tuesdays are 6 dollar movie days! Combine that with the special here and you're set! So dinner and a movie should not put a big dent in your wallet!

So what are you waiting for? The very next tuesday you should check it out! Although if you cant wait then go whenever you want! They are 24 hours so be my guest! I just recommend you take full advantage of the 2 for 1! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Small portions but good food, Very poor slow service for a Friday night and a party of four. The waitress made a comment to us about the tip, Be glad you got one"}
{"text":"greatest crappy pizza, nachos and wings for late night cravings!"}
{"text":"I am really sad to give this place three stars. Walked in at 715 on a Saturday night. Wait was 20 minutes for indoor seating and immediate seating for outside. We chose to sit outside. All was good. Waitress takes our drink order, we all ordered water. Takes our food order, and we were not checked on once from the time she did the food order and when the food came out. Our cups were empty and it was hot outside! When she finally strolls over to the table we had to ask for more water and napkins. The waitress brings us water, but wait a second the water has no ice in it? Why would you give us hot water?????? As for our napkins she set a role of paper towels in a chair.. Okay fine bad service but the food was great! Maui Fries, Philly Cheesesteak Pizza, and the Big Kahuna Appetizer fed all four of us with nothing leftover."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I had the pizza.  It was pretty good.  The bartender was very friendly, too.

I went there again last night. This time I had the wings.  I am not sure if it was because the ranch was bad, or if the chicken was bad, but it gave me pretty severe food poisoning.

The atmosphere is great.  The beer is good.  I really want this place to be good because I live right across the street.  I will never order the wings again."}
{"text":"Balboa has great food and great service. Very Cali feel to the bar and overall vibe inside the resturant. Don't sleep on any of their chicken menu items. Everything from the BBQ chicken pizza to the wings and ceasar salads are amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza for being thin crust and the bread the roast beef sandwich is served on is great too. Makes me wish I was more local.  I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Good Place to grab lunch! 

Went here for lunch on Thursday and it was pretty empty.... we sat at the bar because I wanted to play video poker. 

We ordered chicken wings to start... good and meaty.  Would definitely order these again with a beer next time. (It was lunch time so I stuck to a soft drink.)

I had the California Wrap with the upgraded Onion Rings.  (I had asked for the mayo sauce to be on the side....but they didn't get that right... however, I wasn't going to make a stink about it.... but that's why they didn't get a 4-star review.)

The wrap was fantastic!  The chicken was warm, the avocado was ripe and creamy.... the sprouts added a nice texture and crunchiness that I totally dug... and it had bacon... and everything is better with bacon.  It was also big enough that I only ate 1/2 of it and took the other half home.

The onion rings were great too... big and not greasy.  And the breading was not over powering....meaning there was actually onions in the onion rings.

The husband had the chicken chopped salad and while I didn't get to taste it... it didn't look all that appetizing... it was really blank looking.

Since this place doesn't get slammed like other places for lunch, is reasonable and has a good menu... I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place you can't go wrong with any of the food the BBQ chicken salad is my favorite! It worth the price and the ingredients that super fresh! The pizza is to die for yum yum yummmmmm..oh and Eric is awesome ..such a good guy!"}
{"text":"Boy I hate dissing a place but I have to in this case since I'm being asked for a review.   The two stars are for the great service* and the great Margarita* so take this as it stands:

Four of us decided to go to Balboa pizza at 11:30 P.M. after an evening concert.  The reason we chose this place was because nothing else within few miles was open that late.   
We sat outside (a real plus on a beautiful, balmy evening)  and ordered drinks and two pizzas, one with pepperoni, one with ham and mushrooms.   They only carry one size but a lot of different toppings at .85 cents per.  The pizza is rectangular and cut into 6 slices.   The pepperoni pizza had pepperoni - 8 slices - and we couldn't find the ham except for one little piece on the other pizza.   Zero points for that.  

The pizza was mediocre at best.   The crust was the consistancy of soft cardboard with that same flavor.  None of us like the pizza.  So much for that.

I've never had anything else here so I can only comment on the pizza.

*Service was excellent but we were the only ones in the place except for two guys at the bar.
The Margarita was outstanding but we asked for premium liquor.  

Might give the sandwiches a try some day but no more  pizza for us."}
{"text":"i'd give balboa a 3.5 if i could. came here on tuesday night to meet up with a friend before the movies. the service was great. they knew my friend from being a regular there. we shared some maui waui fries because everybody i know raves about them. to me they were just eh. maybe i had some other image in my head from what people have said or maybe my expectations were just too high. they were alright, but nothing what people i know made them out to be. we also shared some spicy sausage and fresh mushrooms pizza along with the caprese pizza. i am usually a huge fan of caprese pizza, but again, this one didn't wow me. it was okay. my mom enjoyed it though. i happened to LOVE the spicy sausage pizza though. i even ate half of it and didn't realize it. i would be back for that. i'd even be willing to try some other pizza on their menu. tuesday is buy one pizza get one pizza free. can't really beat that deal over at the district before a movie."}
{"text":"Halloween night in the District.  I love this local joint.  We decided to eat here  and enjoy a few beers and some appetizers.
I love the fact that they are open  24 hours, it's a cozy sports bar and restaurant.  We were seated at the bar with large TV screens and poker machines.  The patio has an open service window to the bar  We ordered chicken wings, nachos, calamari and a few beers.
Calamari was very good, lightly breaded, crispy and the squid was not chewy, but the nachos was simple and forgettable. Although this place is known for their pizza, we skipped it tonight, definitely going back.
Perfect for families, quick meet ups with friends, and if you are a tourist staying at the Green Valley Ranch Hotel & Casino,
it's a short walking distance in the heart of the District.  Check it out, enjoyed by many locals like me."}
{"text":"Great lil power lunch place on weekdays! Had the chinese chicken salad and honestly it was one of the best! Very reasonable price, great A+ service and laid back atmoshpere in a very nice shopping venue. Will retrun soon for PIZZA (aka my kryptonite)"}
{"text":"Balboa never fails! Their chopped chicken salad is heaven, their wings are some of the best and, I could probably eat an entire bucket full of their cheesy chips they have. 

They are super friendly there and just an all around good, down to earth, neighborhood place to go, even by yourself."}
{"text":"Always get the Buffalo Wings!!! Never disappoints, plus Late-night happy hour!!! Need I say more?!?!!!"}
{"text":"I went  here for the first time ever, it was really a nice experience, but fumky inside but the food was really good and our bartender was amazing.   The pizza was absolutely delicious. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!!

When we arrived, the hostess tried to put us in a booth with two toddlers in high chairs at the end of the booth. I told her it would not work, and she began to argue with me . . . She asked, \"why?\" I said the kids will not work like this, she asked me \"why won't it work?\" I told her it would not work with the kids, we needed a regular table, she told me we want to save the tale for large groups . . . A table that could sit six (6) and there were six (6) of us??? HUH???

The server took forever to come, when Jeff came, he was clearly not listening and did not like kids.With the other drinks at the table, I asked for three cups of ice (nothing in them) and two kids cups with AT MOST a third full (they make a mess if too much fluid (HELLO, TWO YEAR OLDS). When he came back with much later with ONE (1) cup of ice and two kids cups almost full . . . I should have left there.

The food was tasteless, no spice at all in anything. The pizza sauce had one profile, tomato, no seasoning. The \"spicy sausage\" might have well been hamburger, again, no spice at all.

From the time Jeff dumped the food, not remembering who ordered what, he never came back- not once. I had to catch him just to get the check . . . Then had to wait 10 minutes before I could flag him to take my credit card.

Poor service, not kid friendly, and flavorless food . . . Yep, I can say I will NEVER darken their doors again."}
{"text":"My second visit here (Wednesday half-off rib night!) and the waitress Drea greeted us with the same beers that we both drank last week! What a great waitress!  The ribs are well cooked, with a tasty baked-on sauce that isn't overpowering.  The meat falls off the bones just the way I like it and the sweet potato fries are a new favorite. Lots of tv's and a little noisy, but the outside seats were filled so...can't wait for next Wednesday!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Went for a lunch meeting and sat in the bar area...bartender was very nice and attentive to us.
Ordered the blackened chicken cobb salad and the works pizza....perfect to share and even had left overs.
I would def like to come back."}
{"text":"Sat around for 15 minutes waiting to be served. Went to the bar to order after waiting and got a nasty attitude from an old washed-out hag bartender. 

I really wanted to try this place! Oh well!"}
{"text":"Not coming back.  We live close by and come here on occasion.  The food quality is just not good enough to bring us back anymore.  Our salads were way overdressed and mushy.  The lettuce was wilted.  The French fries were floppy.  Service was pleasant but unfortunately we came to eat not to make friends.  They should rename the business because their focus is clearly the bar."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, my husband really enjoyed the wings (Jamaican and Original).  But way too expensive in my opinion, 18 bucks for two little orders of wings alone?  Our bill after the tip came to over 40 bucks for some wings, a smalll pizza and two sodas.  I'd expect that from some strip place, but come on, Henderson?  So unfortunately probably won't be returning too often due to the high prices."}
{"text":"Eric is the best bartender we've encountered in a long time! He's a hard worker, super friendly, and remembers detail. He's truly an asset to Balboa, we love going in for lunch and appreciate his witty personality!"}
{"text":"YUM!

I love their spicy chicken fingers because they are crispy. Their fries..I think they are called Maui wowwi or something..they have grilled onions and jalapenos on them and are delicious! The california sliders are good. It's a pizza place but I like all of the other items on the menu more. The pizza is not bad, just not my fav. A fun place to meet up with friends before or after the movies."}
{"text":"Tonight my girlfriend and I tried this place for the first time and i have to say it was a great experience. I met Scott the graveyard bartender/server who was extremely helpful on deciding what to order and was very friendly, also met the cook who came out to check on our food also very friendly. The service and food overall was awesome. The place has a great atmosphere and is very clean. It is at least a 20 min. Drive for me but I will be back as often as I can. It is open 24/7 and they have 2 other bar restaurants in the district that are also 24/7 that I am looking forward to trying, Al's Garage, and one other restaurant. Hope you enjoy it ..."}
{"text":"Hidden within the district in Green Valley. Balboa serves your favorite bar foods and goes a little beyond.
My wife and I always split two of our favorite dishes. The meatloaf sandwhich and the buffalo Chicken Salad
-Crispy Buffalo Chicken Salad 
Chopped Greens, Tomatoes, Crumbled Gorgonzola,
Roasted Walnuts and Balsamic Dressing. Topped 
with Buffalo Chicken Strips.
-The meatlof sandi is a perfect hunk of meat with cheese and sauted onions. I ask for the maui fries on the side. They are fries with onions and jalapenos all fried at the same time. 
Many choices here and i never tried anything i didn't like. HH is from 4-7 and the may have a late night one as well. They are open 24/7."}
{"text":"Mariah was my favorite server. She recommended seasonal beers to try and got me my regular drink. She played s game with us as well. Very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Amazing buffalo chicken pizza!! Service took a little long but it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I am surprised at the positive reviews for this place. The pizza was not good in my opinion. The service was great from the male bartender then we were switched to a female server who was unattentive. The fries were good. The loud heavy metal music was unbearable. It was a weird choice of music considering the tropical island decor. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"went to the district to do some shopping and meet some friends for lunch. once lunch was done the waiter kept bringing us the wrong check yet still ran the debit card and would cancel and run it again and again and again. we asked for a manager since we had been waiting to pay the bill for 45 minutes. when he finally got some help the debit card had been ran and canceled so many times the bank declined it and mark it as fraudulent use.not only was the food \"so-so\"(chips were cold and salad was terrible) and waiting for an hour to pay we couldn't do any shopping with our debit card due to it being ran numbers times.The manager appologised and said the waiter was recovering from a severe car accident. If that is the case shame on them for not providing him with the extra help he definitely needed. She offered to take my number so they could send me a gift card which i declined I will NEVER be going back!!! Prayers to the waiter, hope he makes a full recovery."}
{"text":"This place was as good as a pizza place as you can get, The happy Hour is great, the drinks are great, I think its one of the best places in the district."}
{"text":"The staff was very unfriendly to start. In particular this male (Ted - the general manager) heard me tell my boyfriend the ribs were a bit dry & he proceeded to tell to the staff around him that he once kicked a lady out for complaining too much. It was loud enough I could hear it which made me believe he was talking about me. My dining experience was anything but pleasant with this guy around."}
{"text":"I loved the idea of individualized pizza! A whole pizza to myself, hell yes! I ordered The Works pizza and although it wasn't someone incredible or original it was definitely pizza and a lot better than a classic chain delivery pizza place. The thin crust was perfect and was even better dipped in ranch dressing. The restaurant itself is adorable, decorated with island girl pinup posters and has a very relaxed summery feeling."}
{"text":"Awesome service good looking people. 
Very nice and friendly.
Our waitress recommended an amazing salad called chicken chopped salad I think lol and  the pizza bbq chicken and red onions. 

Just a Small but.... we need less people asking if we need stuff and talents give more refills"}
{"text":"Nice spot to watch some football! Their wings are really good. The staff were all super-friendly! They don't put their alcohol prices on the menu and for some reason that really gets under my skin."}
{"text":"I like the location in the District.
I like that it's 24 hours (you never know....)
The pizza is pretty solid, but nothing spectacular.
They have a wide variety of specialty pizzas - from margherita to buffalo chicken to taco.
Prices are ok.
Happy hour prices are better, but there are no kids allowed on the bar side.
Despite having a huge long hallway, the seating area is actually pretty small, so it can get crowded on a weekend night."}
{"text":"The first thing I have to point out for pizza snobs, like myself: This is California style pizza, but has to be the best California style pizza I've ever had.

I've eaten here since it first opened, and the quality is not only good, but it's consistently  good. Why not great? Because it is California style pizza which is kind of boring on the palette compared to it's North East cousins but if you give them the that leeway then you're in for a pleasant surprise.

Going back to the quality, which is consistently good, I've never had a pizza there which was under cooked or overly cooked and never had a dinner companion (date, friends, family, etc) walk away with any complaints.

The wait service has never let me down, except for the times the hostess station has been left abandoned for an extended amount of time when waiting to be seated or picking up take out.

The price is kind of on the high side for this type of pizza and it's size, but given it's location (The District) it's understandable and possibly warranted to produce same the same consistency in quality. I could easily eat a whole one myself, but the girlfriend and I are satisfied splitting a pizza after starting off with a small salad each.

4 stars? I really wish I could give 3.5, but I'm willing to round up because as I mentioned they are constantly good, open 24 hours, in a great location, and unlike some other pizza places, you don't have to chase down a parm-cheese and hot-pepper shaker."}
{"text":"4 stars but only because l don't give 5 very often. Great food all the sauces are excellent. Wine list is good and the roxy drink is very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Worst Grilled Cheese Ever + Poor Management.

Menu should read: Sourdough Sandwich 
80% Light Sourdough Bread, 15% Veggies & 5% Provolone Cheese.
When asked by the waiter how our Food was we commented that the Sandwich pretty much was awful. He then allowed us to write our comments on a paper, which was then logged into the Comment Box in addition to immediately giving it to the on site Manager. Nothing was done + no manager followed up to our Table.
This item reads \"Grilled Cheese served Panini Style\"
* All Bread, so little Cheese. Who serves a Grilled Cheese with no butter on the bread? And there was no Grilled marks on the Bread (as a Panini would). What is this doing on the Menu??"}
{"text":"Balboa Pizza and eats located in The District in GVR area is a perfect location if it's a beautiful, sunny afternoon like today, this is a nice place to catch a meal with family and friends. There is ample indoor seating and a few outdoor tables with access to the bar. It has a Tommy Bahama at the beach feel, surfboards, vintage pictures of beach scenes and bamboo slats line the walls. 
The food is pretty good. Items ordered tonight were mozzarella sticks, buffalo chicken wings (they offer a big choice of sauces, buffalo, teriyaki, chipotle, Maui, BBQ,etc.), green Greek salad (half order), BBQ chicken pizza, roasted garlic and artichoke pizza, chicken-avocado wrap. The apps were delicious, the wings were huge, the pizzas were good, however the roasted garlic was forgotten off the pizza. And, I hate to say it, but a green beetle crawled out of our side of cilantro. Now, if it was a razor blade or a human hair, I would have really freaked out, but a bug, they live in and on plants. I wasn't too upset, but our friend was beside himself. He told the waitress who took the little critter away and then the manager came over and apologized again and again, finally comping our meal which I thought was pretty cool. The waitress we had was very friendly and checked in on us a lot. Overall, the accommodating professionalism won me over, honestly, a bug in my greens is not that big of a deal (even if it's washed it could still live) (although our friend questioned if our greens had been washed previously which skeeved me out a little at the thought) and I would still give a Balboa another shot."}
{"text":"I love the vibe in this place; they are going for a surfer/Hawaiian restaurant feel.  It is self seating so find a booth, bar table or outdoor seat.

We got the Hawaiian pizza and an order of Coconut shrimp.  Quite possibly the best coconut shrimp I have ever had: big, plump and full of coconut flavor.  The shrimp sit on top of a bucket of fries mixed with onions and jalapenos, it was okay.  The Hawaiian pizza was also very good, very flavorful.

One big note:  The food comes out fast and piping hot, let it cool off for 5-7 minutes before digging in and the crust will be harder and won't burn your mouth.

I highly recommend stopping in for the coconut shimp and a beer."}
{"text":"Honestly, whenever I come here it's really for the Maui Waui Fries! I get extra onions and jalapeños because these fries are too good! Also a fan of the crispy shrimp, BBQ chicken salad, and wings!"}
{"text":"I Used to really like it here, but the pizza was not what I remember this last time. The pizza dough appeared to be processed and frozen, there was almost zero sauce and it wasn't cooked through, dough was almost raw inside."}
{"text":"i've only been to this place once, but i'm totally a fan of their chicken pesto pizza! it's the best i've had and in CALI i'm always in search of a comparable one and haven't found one yet... !!! 

my friends never want to drive out to green valley (come on- we've been driving 6 hours, what's another 30 min?) but one day, i'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"The bartenders are friendly. I eat here all the time, because they are the only place to get a salad past 10pm, but I noticed on more than one occasion that the cooks don't use gloves! The last time, the guy took off his hat, ran his hands through his greasy hair and then continued to make a wrap with his bare hands! 

I hope management reads these reviews."}
{"text":"We went to the wine walk last night and Balboa pizza was one of the booths. My friend loved the little piece of pizza they were offering so we decided to head there to continue the party. 

Upon entering, the bar area was almost packed due to the hockey game playing. We were seated in a booth near the bar area facing the TVs. Loved that they had several TVs in all directions. 

We were greeted by our server fairly quickly getting our drinks out of the way. We order a pepperoni pizza, my friend had a glass of wine, wife ordered mango margaritas, and I went the boring route of Coors light. 

My wife enjoyed her margaritas so much she ordered 3. However, they are a bit heavy handed on the ice. The  service was great. Well, the server we had. Shaston? I think her name was. The other two girls we encountered not so nice. 

The pizza was okay. Definitely didn't taste like the ones we had out in the wine walk. 

I would come back if I was in the area requesting our server we had. Overall, good experience:)"}
{"text":"I came here after a movie, like most others, it was pretty late and I was surprised they were open, but now I know where I can get good pizza after a night out if I'm ever in Henderson. I got their"}
{"text":"Balboa's is an outstanding late night eatery. 

This is a pizzeria but should be rightly called a wing joint! The chicken wings are huge and meaty and extra crispy and come in a surprising variety of flavors such as Jamaican spice, Thai peanut, and of course your classic buffalo. These chicken wings are so good they are more like angel wings! 

We came here after a wine walk at Lake Las Vegas. This is one of the top 24 hour eateries in the area. 

We split a pepperoni, spicy sausage, red onion, and jalapeño pizza. The pizza tasted fresh and delicious. We also ordered 6 medium buffalo wings which my girlfriend declared to be the best ever. 

Notably, balboa's location precludes me from eating there more often. First, it is on the opposite side of town from where I live. Second, the finest BBQ joint in Las Vegas, Lucille's, is a stone throw away in the same shopping center. 

Balboa's is a great choice if you have already had your weekly Lucille's fix, you are craving tasty pizza or sublime angel's wings, or you come with the late night crowd."}
{"text":"Marvelous neighborhood bar with indoor and outdoor seating. Great bartenders. I usually drop by super late night for boneless wings, pizza and my favorite pineapple mixed drink. Gambling bar tops, too. Easy parking.

They seem to be known for their pizza and wings. Their boneless chicken has a crunchy crust, not flaky. Its tossed in a myriad of saucy delights! Not oily. The crust is firmly attached to the white meat. Did not feel weighed down."}
{"text":"My husband and I like coming here when we're craving pizza or want a relatively quick lunch or dinner. It's very easy to get in and out of this place since it's in The District.

We always start with the Maui Waui fries. The salty fries with the hot jalapeno and sweet onions is addicting and delicious. We've tried several of the specialty pizzas and enjoyed each one. The tostada pizza is both tasty and filling. The pizzas are good split between two people."}
{"text":"Amazing and creative pizza choices. I like \"the works,\" but they also have a spinach and artichoke pizza that is bomb.com

Beware, though. The buffalo chicken pizza comes in mild, medium, and hot. If you are brave enough to order the hot, you are not in for a fun night. It hurts going in, and it hurts coming out. My fault, not Balboa's. Even though we went against the bartenders advice and made the misguided decision to order the hot, we still ate it all. My friends and I are suffering.

Worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch time on a Friday with the wife and Baby.  Bartender actually opened the door for us and greeted.  Walked by the cooks and they also acknowledged.  Got the trio chips as usual and they were good.  Usually get the pizza or rib and they are always very good.  The wife got a pizza and I tried the meatloaf sandwich and was not impressed.  Bread wasn't toasted all the way and was dry and way too much for the sandwich.  Meatloaf was not good.  Fries that came with it were amazing.  As well as the dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé come here all the time. Alesha was our server tonight and man she is amazing. She is on it with out being to in your face. Every server we have ever had here is always amazing. Food is always amazing. Very accommodating with the games on tv. Great beer selection. Will be back and will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night around 1am and wanted a quick bite before we headed home. 
Corey was our bartender and he was the sweetest. 
Loved the jukebox selection for music 
And loved the pizza! 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cool little spot with a Newport Beach theme/decor. Waitress was sweet but the food was just blah at best and WAY over-priced. We had a salad and one of their individual pizzas. Total was $39.43....WTH?? The quality and portions should have dictated a price of $20 max. Will not be returning to this ripoff of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fell in love with the Balboarita and fish tacos! Great service given from our hostess Maggie and she's such a hard worker! I will most def be going there often because of her service and the drinks!"}
{"text":"A decent place for a quick bite or drink before a movie. The spicy sausage & mushroom pizza was OK and not as thin as I expected it to be. The bucket of chips with cheese dip was good, a little expensive for chips though. My friend said they were bottomless but it was not to be true and that was another $5 bucks on the tab :("}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! There is a tall brunette waitress we love to have wait on us. Next time we will have to get her name. The basil and tomato pizza, chicken fingers, and maui fries are awesome! Also, try the long island ice tea. Yummm."}
{"text":"Just had very good fish and chips, along with fresh brewed coffee. Yum!! 
Bri was my excellent server. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. Went last Thursday..It was awesome. So I went back with a friend this past Sunday. Some of the best wings and ribs in this part of town.
Probably the best food in the District. The Blacken Chicken Cobb is a killer.
And the chips are so thick and fresh. Actually everything was very fresh .
Service  was very good. And it you get Eric behind the bar....your drinks will be as good
as your meal..
This place is much more then pizza.
I'll be back...:-)."}
{"text":"The prices went up a wee bit, but the selection has increased, it is still 24 hours, the tropical iced tea still is refreshing, and I can walk here.  No complaints!  Eric R. jokes that he moved to the area simply because when he visited me, I took him to Balboa so much.

Tonight we split a house salad and one of the new additions to the menu, the goat cheese pizza.  It was goat cheese baked onto the pizza with caramelized onions (such a depth of flavor, I almost felt like I was eating UMAMI itself!) topped with mixed field greens, more goat cheese crumbles, walnuts, and drizzled balsamic vinaigrette.  

We devoured the pizza so fast.  I think it is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"The wings were decent, the pizza was so over priced.  I guess because it's located in the District they can charge those kinds of prices $11.45 for a personal pizza and that's only cheese!  Toppings are extra!! Service although the waitress was sweet was way too slow.  We kept looking for someone to help us.  Sorry..... I hope this review helps the owner."}
{"text":"Big booths great for the family.  One of our favorites.  It is a bar / restaurant but the restaurant section has big roomy booths.  Sometimes we will eat here before a movie or just because we love this place.  If you get a pizza and a salad, you can easily share for two people and not over eat.  They also have great kids meal choices.  Sometimes, if you come in the evening, you will wait 10-15 minutes but usually, there is no wait at all."}
{"text":"I love coming here for late night food and drinks. The pizza is good, the drinks are fun, and the staff is friendly. And the place is well lit, which is nice as unlike many bars, you can actually read the menu and see the food that you ordered without having to use your phone to illuminate it. The restaurant has a beach/surfer vibe and the signature drinks match the theme. 

The food selection is mainly bar food, but it's pretty good bar food without having to try to be ~fancy~. On our last trip here, we shared the chip trio appetizer that included house made chips with 3 dipping sauces and it was more than enough for a late night snack for 2 people (we couldn't finish it). I definitely recommend it. In the past, we've ordered different items off the appetizer menu and also pizzas and haven't been disappointed. 

The bottom line: if you're looking for good bar food, a bar where you can actually see and talk to the people you came with, or a place with friendly bar staff, then this is a place you should check out."}
{"text":"Fun place. Nice environment. I honestly never really saw this place at GVR? But food was good enough-pizza, salad, and some chips. Tried the banana hammock cocktail...that was tasty.  I'm sure we will be back at some point."}
{"text":"Service is really nice here. We usually get the chicken wings that are Thai peanut sauce flavor and the pepperoni pizza. The atmosphere is really relaxed and has a beach hut feel. My only problem would be the pricing can be a little high for bar food period but the service makes up for it."}
{"text":"I don't eat this kind of food often... If you're having a bad day and looking for greasy goodness, this is a great restaurant for you. The southern fried wings were killer, Greek salad, delicious, potato chips divine, and the service was good. Only complaint was the pizza. Not great pizza. Not really good at all. Pretty soggy and no flavor in the crust. But for wings, great joint and good for a group of friends to kick back for wings, beer and sports."}
{"text":"We came in and grabbed a pizza and some chicken fingers. Food was good. Service was okay. Open 24 hrs."}
{"text":"I've been sitting on the patio fit over 20 minutes and haven't been acknowledged. The table next to me had ordered and received food since I sat down. The waitress even made eye contact with me while she an order from people who say down 15 minutes after me."}
{"text":"Pizza was some of the best I've had in a long time and the apps are pretty great as well."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed.  I ordered a spicy sausage and mushroom pizza for take-out last night.   While the toppings and cheese were fine (four stars), the crust was like a mushy pancake and there was very little red sauce.  I could have ordered it well done, and that might have improved the crust but I'm not sure.   Guess I was just looking for a more New York style, bubbling crackling crust pizza.  Oh well."}
{"text":"We ordered the bucket of chips with the jalapeño cheese dipping sauce, a chix chopped salad, and a Hawaiian pizza. The chips and salad were tasty, but I was a little disappointed with the pizza. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were there...  It's just that the pizza was a little too thin to support all the toppings. The pineapples were canned, too. 

I would go back and try the barbecue pizza next."}
{"text":"Lastnight was the first time we had visited Balboa and our feelings are mixed. My husband had the fried shrimp and fries and my son had the pepperoni pizza. The fries were very greasy and my son thought that the Flatbread pizza was alright but not worth 12.95 (very little toppings). Not sure if we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings place! Everytime I come here, its always good food. Love Balboa!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had been wanting to try this place and we happened to go last night on Buy one get one pizza night. My wife ordered everything pizza and I ordered the Buffalo chicken pizza. We shared the Trio Bucket of Chips. Buffalo pizza was outstanding, it was different with the ranch coated lettuce on top. More like a buffalo chicken po boy on a pizza crust. Nice work! The everything or works pizza was good but nothing too special. Bucket of chips needed some seasoning, salt or something-pretty bland. The 3 sauces served with the chips were great so overall great food experience. A Plus was that our waitress was great as well, nice and very efficient. 

We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Ok at best. The atmosphere is nice and clean. Service was lacking, we had to hunt down the waitress to get drink refills, ect. The wings where good but the pizza was really disappointing, especially for the price. We'll definitely keep looking for a good pizza place."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but that's not the first thing I want when I come here.  I love their homemade potato chips!  The chips are delicious and dusted with parmasean cheese and they come with any or all of the dipping sauces; rance, onion, cheese.  As I said before, Delicious!  The Maui Waui fries are pretty darn tasty as well.  There are a number of different types of pizza, a bit reminiscent of CPK but I think there is a better selection here.  The pizzas are very good but sometimes I think the crust is a bit soggy around the middle area.  Good beers on tap and a pretty good Happy Hour.  Tuesdays are 2 for 1 pizzas and that is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their Italian Grilled Cheese Sandwich. And the restaurant decor is so cute, it's a beach vibe."}
{"text":"This is a find that I think may get overlooked by the average diner because of it's location in the District.  There are certainly larger restaurants in the District (Lucille's, King's, etc), and Balboa is kind of tucked away, but it's fantastic.  The pizza is excellent, with a great crust on the bottom.  I know some find it to become soggy, but that's not been my experience.  They use an excellent quality sausage on their pizzas, very flavorful.  To start, try the chip trio with homemade potato chips and 3 sauces (jalapeno cheese, garlic ranch and onion).  The jalapeno cheese is the best here, but all are good.

The sandwiches are made using the pizza dough as bread, and they are packed full.  We always take part, if not half, of a sandwich home when we eat a Balboa.  We have tried several, but the favorites for us are the Savory (with roast beef and havarti) and meatloaf.  But, we've not had a sandwich we didn't like.

They serve their Maui Fries on the side, which is french fries tossed with jalapenos and onions.  The veggies get nice and soft, but I could use more heat.  But, these are some great fries and it's a good idea.  

We love this place, will definitely return, and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome here... Somewhat thin crust and artisan style.  The bucket of chips are very unique and a must to get the meal stated.  The service is really good. Plus they are 24 hrs. Tuesday is buy one pizza and get one free."}
{"text":"Balboa Pizza Company can be a fun place to pop in when you've been out and about in The District and need a quick bite to eat.  However based on a variety of reasons I had to give it 3 stars.  There are many kinds of pizza.  At Balboa they serve some kind of alternative interpretation which in my opinion isn't a winner.  They do however delicious pizza bread sandwiches which are served with fresh chips.  The chips aren't as good as their Maui Waui fries w/ jalapenos and onions and queso dip.  I have never been comfortable in this restaurant do to the fact the seating is made up of hardwood bench booths.  If you like to play video poker and drink beer they have a bar which accommodates these functions (neither of which is my style)."}
{"text":"Best Place for low Cost food and drink in the District.  Food is good and reasonably priced, wait is usually not to long, and the bar has a good atmosphere.  High marks across the board."}
{"text":"I had went here with my BF for dinner the first time. He's been here before with a couple of his friends, so I let him order his usual flat bread pizza. I must say it was extremely delicious and filling. It's very relaxing and not noisy at all especially for a Friday night! Definitely a place to go back to again."}
{"text":"Went yesterday and love the atmosphere, wings were ok since I like them extra crispy, the service was good , the chicken tenders I took home for my daughter were super good.. Maui fries thought it was a different thing but just plain fries with some caramelized onions but no taste and the sauce is just mayo & ketchup so disappointed, but I like the place .. I'm going back to try the pizzaaa."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the restaurant was empty. They took a long time to get our drinks and they didn't make my pizza the way I ordered it. However, the Pizza was good. The pizzas are a bit on the pricey side for the size, but the taste is Delicious  
I will definitely return and hope for better service."}
{"text":"Okay. Service is not good at all. Food is excellent so I still gave it 3 stars. I've been here 4 times and this last time the waitress literally forgot we were there! She didn't come to refill our drinks until the end. She gave us the bill and said \"oh I was given another section!\" Like who cares and what does that have to do with us waiting for you to come serve us??? Check out the picture of us waiting.

Update: apparently the picture of us waiting for service was taken down by Yelp because it didn't meet their standards. But it was a picture of a skeleton waiting at a table. Go figure. I think it was an accurate depiction of our wait time."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. It's a nice, small restaurant/bar area that's conveniently located in the district next to green valley ranch. The best part is they're open 24 hours 7 days a week. The waiters have never given me a problem so their service is great and timely. 

All of the food items are amazing. The pizzas I've tried are delicious! My favorite is the pepperoni and three cheeses. Their wings are not too bad and their maui waui fries are great! The one thing I always have to get every time I come is their bucket of chips with the jalapeño cheese dip. Sooo addicting! 

Tuesdays are the best days to go because they have a 2 for 1 special on all pizzas! Pretty fantastic! The only thing thats a little pricey are some of their items on their drink menu for cocktails/beers. I'm sure the happy hour prices are a good deal though so in essence, I'd recommend this place to anyone that wants a cool, casual place to go with friends."}
{"text":"I love their pizza, Maui fries, and tropical ice tea. Their fries sauce is one of those sauces that if I could buy it by the gallon to have some with every meal, I would!!! The only complaint I have is with their pricing, it's a bit steep for thin crust pizzas, but I keep coming back for more, so maybe that tells you something!"}
{"text":"For lunch today, me and some coworkers went to Balboa, because we were looking for something quick, but not necessarily fast food.  I have been to this place many times before and have always loved their pizzas, however, this is what I got today:

FOOD and SERVICE:  Fish and chips for $11.95- 3 pieces of cod, beer battered and fried, served with Maui Waui fries- fries with jalapeños and onions.  The entire meal was served with tartar sauce and a homemade thousand island dressing sauce for the fish.  The batter was super crispy and light.  The fish was juicy and fulfilling.  I also enjoyed the dressed up fries as the jalapenos weren't too hot.  Our server was Christina, who was both our server and the bartender.  She was really nice, gave us our space, however checked back at appropriate times.  Great job!

DRINKS:  When I come to Balboa, I always get the same thing- Newcastle and Fat Tire blend. Two of my favorite beers combined together.  How could you NOT love it!!!

AMBIANCE:  The place is a pub style, surfer-ish, laid back, \"read a newspaper while you watch the waves\" kind of place.  As I learned today, the place was named after the owner's favorite California spot, Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach, CA.  The menu is literally made into a newspaper to help mold the customer experience and I love it.  As many times as I have been here, I know that this place is treasured by the locals and set in a very great community.

Let's be honest, we are far from being known as a beach town, but it's nice to see a place beach a beach theme and vision really shine through.  This place has never done me wrong and I know I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with service and food.   Friendly staff.   Home made chips were excellent.   Had garlic chicken with garlic white sauce pizza."}
{"text":"Balboa definitely fills my late night need for pizza.  Their pizza is good, but not great.  Sometimes the crust is overly soggy, making the toppings slide right off.  Some of the specialty pizzas are kind of icky.  However, I get their supreme pizza (or whatever they call it there) and sub jalapenos for the ham... and I'm pretty fond of it.  It's an ok place, but a bit overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I come here often and I have never had a bad experience! All of their bartenders & servers (for the few I've had) have delivered exceptional service. There menu is served like a news paper which to me is fun and inventive. Their Maui onion rings are delicious, and I've probably had every pizza they offer, but my all time favorite and go to is their veggie flatbread sand which!! I'm a sucker for veggie melts!! 

The setting is nice and beach like, at night they open the \"garage door\" and it's creates a whole different vibe. They are open 24 hours and have gambling machines!! ( I'm a sucker for shinny things ;) ) 

Like I said I've never had a bad experience there, and today was no exception. After receiving great service from our server ( forgot his name) but he was awesome and quirky and having amazing jaimican jerk wings with a meat lovers pizza and bean dip, it just reminded me how awesome this place really is!"}
{"text":"Careful with the video poker comp drinks.   New policy is ONE DRINK FOR EACH $20 put in!!!!!!    

I was lucky enough to grind away on my $20 before losing it.    Bartender wanted to charge me for my second beer.  

Needless to say, I'm never going back ..........."}
{"text":"Service was great, Thank you Larissa. I was not impressed with this establishment overall. Food was only ok, and prices were really high. for mediocre food at best. The good thing was the service. The other problem is that the server, was the hostess, busser, food runner,cashier, and server. She was alone and had 6-8 tables."}
{"text":"How can you not be a fan of buy one, get one free pizza night? It happens on Tuesday, and it works best if you come with a large group so you can eat your way through every pizza on the menu. Otherwise, the true joy of bogo is lost. The pizzas average $14/piece. 

The pizza here is definitely about the combination of toppings, not the crust. The crust is thin and becomes a bit soggy when holding the saucier, heavier combinations; however, overall, there are some solid pizza flavors. The highlights: goat cheese, walnuts, balsamic, arugula (I have recently realized I pretty much just love balsamic.); tostada (Yes, with beans and avocado and a mountain of iceberg lettuce that when topped with Tabasco results in hot sauce in your nose somehow.); and an artichoke chicken. The lowlights for me were the cheesesteak and the pesto (two separate pies to be clear).

The restaurant atmosphere is nice. The service was solid, and they have happy hour on drinks daily from 4-7pm that includes some $3-$4 beer. Unfortunately, my Batch 19 was not party of the happy hour, but it still made me happy."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the second time yday, but I'm still having trouble getting excited about it. 

Things we tried:

Chicken wings (mild): Nothing special. I honestly prefer PT\"s wings.

Coconut shrimp with maui fries: coconut shrimp were alright, but the fries sucked. They were limp and greasy and tasteless. 

Pizza/salad combo: Caesar salad had a weird taste to it. Maybe some would like it, I didn't. The pizza was very *eh*. If I'm doing the \"mini\" pizza thing in the future I will always do BJ's instead. $5 during happy hour and far tastier!!

Oh and screw them for ending happy hour at 6 PM. $4 for a freaking Coors Light at 6:15 is depressing. It's not like we're on the strip!"}
{"text":"With one of our party using a scooter we were well taken care of with great wait service and always consistently superb ribs.
It is sometimes an inconvenience to work around a scooter but not with the staff at Balboa's"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day. Heard a lot of good things about their wings but I decied to try there buffalo chicken sandwitch instead. The waittress informed me that they didnt have the correct bread to make the sandwitch so she said they will use the pizza dough instead. 

The sandwitch was awesome was a bit messy but very tasty. The spicyness was counteracted by the coldslaw and the crumbled cheese. I would suggest getting this sandwitch and asking for the pizza dough. Also the chips that came with the meal were great, I couldnt stop eating them.

The service on the other hand not so much. I went with a friend and she asked for plan chicken strips but when it was brought to the table they had buffalo sauce on them. My friend told the waitress and it seems like she was a bit mad that we are asking to send it back. She brought back the right order fairly quickly but she seemed short with us the rest of the meal.

Food he is great but the service wasn't the greatest, then again in could have been the wrong day."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try this restaurant in the District for quite some time and finally had the chance to.  I love the cozy island decor.  There is a bar and plenty of booth seating.  We haven't had to wait to be seated either time we've been here. 

The pizza is different.  If you're craving your basic pizza and comparing that to Balboa I don't think this is going to cut it.  But if you order with an open mind expecting a unique pizza (which is smaller than your typical pie) then I think you'll be pleased.  So far we've tried three cheese and Philly cheesesteak pies and they're delicious.  The best time to go is on Tuesdays when the pizzas are BOGO with a one drink purchase per pie.  The last time, I got water and my husband ordered 2 beers and we were able to get the deal.  

The homemade chips are incredible.  I will definitely be craving them.  Fried mozzarella was OK - nothing special.  

We've been here twice and the service is very quick.  The servers are friendly, albeit sometimes dismissive.  I asked for a ginger ale and the waitress said they could make it with sprite and a splash of coke... she mentioned that this was the ginger ale most bars served.  Not in my experience.  And if I'm craving a ginger ale, there'd be one pretty obvious taste missing from that mixture... ginger.  Also, the same server accidentally spilled my glass of iced water on me and I had to walk out with a wet (white) t-shirt.  A walk of shame if I've ever had one LOL.  She was apologetic as she handed me the check.  

This will be on our \"Tuesday rotation\" and maybe other days occasionally if we're at the District and wanting some food and drink."}
{"text":"This was the place to be after a long day of work at GVR. Nothing was better than getting off of work, gathering some friends, ordering drinks, pizzas, and a few salads to share. Haven't been here in a few years, and it took Lisa L.'s review to get it back on my radar.

The Happy Hour runs from 4pm-7pm and only covers drinks. Drinks range from $3-$5 with beers on the lower end, well drinks in the middle, and wine rounding out the numbers. There are no food specials besides the ones they have on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Begin the week with $.50 wings with a minimum order of ten. Tuesday's special is buy one get one free pizza. Wednesdays are half off for a whole rack of ribs. $10.95 gives you a feast consisting of two slabs of meat that falls off the bone, pineapple coleslaw, and jalapeno onion fries. The sides are not the best, but the ribs make up for it. Some bites were dry, but at the price we paid, it was a steal. Add their refreshing House Salad and this meal is complete for two. All of these deals require a beverage purchase. If you are sharing the ribs, an addition $5 extra plate charge will be added without the purchase of a salad or appetizer. With the three of us and a baby; we got a pizza, a rack of ribs, the Maui Onion Rings, a House Salad, and a piece of chocolate cake. Let's pretend the kid ate a lot so that the rest of us don't look like fatties. The Caprese Pizza was delicious. It is hard to go wrong with tomatoes, mozzarella, fresh basil, and a balsamic reduction. The onion rings were tossed in panko and fried to perfection. The crunch could be heard throughout The District. The cake was decadent and definitely as fudgy as they promised. 

Next time I will definitely take Lisa's advice and get the Goat Cheese Pizza."}
{"text":"If you know me you know that I'm all about Grimaldis when it comes to a favorite pizza joint.  Ever since that fateful night that I first had my fingers blackened with the coal cooked crust, my taste in pizza has never been the same.   I do, on occasion, find myself at other pizza places upon request from other unenlightened friends, which is what has brought me to Balboa Pizza Company on several occasions.

When a friend suggests eating there, I must say that I don't put up a fight or resist in the least, because Balboa does make a fine pizza.  It's located in the District so if you go on a weekend evening be prepared to drive around in circles in the parking lot and questioning any fellow passengers as to why exactly the lot is so full.  I always assume they're at Lucille's, but just this past Saturday night, it turns out many of them were at Balboa because it was the most crowded I'd ever seen it.   Nearly every table and bar seat was occupied, with a large majority of the crowd inexplicably still paying attention to an NFL Playoff blowout.  We luckily got a booth, and ordered our usual starter of Crispy Shrimp and Maui Waui fries (if that's a Half Baked movie reference, then :D  )  I usually let other people order the pizza type from this point forward, so long as it has some sort of meaty goodness as a topping.  This time was the Chicken and Roasted Garlic pizza with jalapenos on the side.

The appetizer came shortly after the first round of alcoholic beverages were nearing depletion, and they were as good as usual.  Crispy pieces of fried shrimp mixed in a pail with nicely cooked french fries, and a couple dipping sauces of unknown origin.  Lots of little pieces of onion and jalapeno also mixed in for kicks.  I wouldn't fathom a visit without ordering this.  

The pizza came out while midway through the 2nd round of drinks.  As always the crust was soggy towards the middle which made them perfect for folding.  I've had several of the pizzas here, and must say that I lean towards the more standard ones that I've tried.  The cheesesteak and pulled pork pizzas didn't taste nearly as good as they've sounded when tried on previous visits, but I almost always like a straight up pepperoni with mushroom, chicken and garlic, or other more straightforward ones.  One of the few places not in Chinatown where going adventurous ended up backfiring on me.

Service is always great, and they tend to hire wait staff that don't seem to be depressed to be at work which is always a plus.   This past visit I even got a great discount for working at CSN, which I didn't even know about and the waiter mentioned it when he saw my debit card.   Knocked off $15 or so off the bill, so teachers, take advantage!

So it's not Grimaldis, but in the end it doesn't need to be."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and the pizza was great! Didn't expect this place to be so good. Really liked the vibe of this place. Basketball all over on multiple TVs was a definite plus for me."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING FOOD! Their chicken chop salad is to die for! They also have some delicious pizza! On Tuesdays it is buy 1, get 1 free. Perfect for a simple night out"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for service... first at the bar and then outside servers never came. I walked out and went to Lucille's instead!"}
{"text":"Food is always consistent and one of the best in the neighborhood. Salads and pies are great but there wings are the best in town. Staff is super friendly and always on it. One of the few gaming bars that still restricts smokers and doesn't allow any smoking in the restaurant or bar. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the Maui Waui fries and they were greasy and soft. The sausage & mushroom pizza wasnt cooked all the way and was still doughy. Best thing about this experience was the company I came with. Sorry, for the price I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Visiting  from New York first time visit. Place is in great plaza with quality shops. Bar had gambling videos to play. Spend $20 and any alcohol drink is free. Ordered square pizza bread great and lots of cheese. Lady sitting next to me was waiting for takeout and won $300. Not a bad place to wait."}
{"text":"Scott and Randy are the best bartenders in town. Seriously I come here all the time because they are friendly and always remembers their customers. I love the buffalo chicken pizza, turkey Ruben."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in years, so decided to try something on the Happy Hour/NFL menu.
The carnitas pork (haha) tacos for $7 were very good. They're served with a big portion of chips, which warrants extra salsa. I sat at the bar and luckily it's a smoke free establishment. They had Lienenkugel Berry Weiss, which I was impressed with. The menu has a nice variety of pizzas, as well as sandwiches, apps and the like. They still do two for one pizza on Tuesdays- yay! 

For a poker bar, they've done a nice job with the restaurant portion. I like the beachy theme and the patio. Balboa is part of The District Tavern Group, so gamers have 3 poker bars to choose from at The District. I believe it's been Balboa since The District opened, while the other 2 poker bars rotate names/themes every few years. It's a 24 hour joint, and I bet you can get food at anytime. But don't quote me on that."}
{"text":"Only been here once, on a very chilly Tuesday, for a gathering of some fellow Yelpers to celebrate Lisa R's Ph.D accomplishment.  But that was enough to get me thinking about the pizzas served up at Balboa Pizza Company.

I don't even remember how many different pizzas we ordered as a group, but I definitely remembered that they were all good to very good (especially the Goat Cheese with Caramelized Onions pizza and the Tostada pizza).  And I for sure want to go back and try more of the menu, especially on their buy 1 pizza get another free Tuesday promotion.

The restaurant is just a short walk away from GVR Casino, in case the Maps app only navigate you to the entrance of the parking lot of this shopping, dining and entertainment complex called The District. Or just look for the Directory and find your way there after you park.  With all the pizzas that will likely be consumed, it will not be a bad idea to walk some of it off before getting back in the car.

Service was excellent and splitting the checks with not a hassle. Pizzas came out fairly quickly, as it is the thin flat bread crust variety.  The flavor combinations of their specialty pizzas are the key to their success, but eat it quickly while it is hot and before the thin crust gets soggy. Even though it is in the other corner of the greater LV valley for me, it is still worth the drive to get my grub on at Balboa Pizza Company.

So when is the next UYE?"}
{"text":"Ordered a half buffalo chicken and the works and a side of wings to go last night. I'm sorry but $25 should buy you a decent portion with better quality in my book. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Sad to say I wasn't impressed with the service either. My friend and I stood at the front/bar for a good 10mins before we were even acknowledged even tho some employees already made eye contact with us. Finally, a girl tells us she's got bad news that their oven had broke and no pizzas could be made, but she could still get us the wings... At this point mind you, was already over 30mins after I placed the order. Could have at least called me back and tell me? But a mere 30seconds later she comes back in the bubbliest tone 'oh nvm!! It's fixed!!' At midnight ready to go home-what a way to play with my emotions. Lol. so needless to say I won't be making this a priority spot."}
{"text":"My little favorite hole in the wall pizza joint in the district! If you like old school square cut east coast style pizza this is the place! 

They have a little outside bar patio that you can eat and drink at also. 

Prices are reasonable being located in a resort corridor. Stop in and check them out if you like a good pizza!"}
{"text":"Simple food but so good. The house salad seems cheap and not the most beautiful but it is so tasty, with the candied nuts and the subtle cheese added in, recommend for starter. The chicken wings were a 4/5- they weren't greasy like some wings can be, tender, fresh, and hardy. And the spinach artichoke pizza was very flavorful with the garlic white sauce. Everything came out very hot."}
{"text":"This is our \"go-to\" spot that my brother and I discovered after searching for a good late night restaurant /hang out for about 4 months into moving here. The atmosphere is awesome, great location and our waiter, Jeff, is the best of the best! Request him when you visit, and you won't be disappointed. The food is awesome and they have great deals on drinks. LOVE this place, and being a manager in the hospitality industry, I'm very critical and super picky. 

Their pizza is DELICIOUS and their mozzarella sticks are way better than you'd expect mozzarella sticks to be. 

I loved this place and you will too!"}
