{"text":"I am truly in love with everything about this place. I work in financial district area. Today, I was walking by and saw the restaurant and decided to give it a try. Definitely worth it. They have a really nice patio right in front of subway station. I don't know how I have never seen this place before.I was very surprised when I saw the inside of the restaurant. They have a very cool lounge area and bar. The colors and design are very modern and sweet.   I would recommend everyone to try the French Martini. They also have Stiegl on tab! The bar selection is amazing and way better than any other bars have around this location. They ve  got almost everything.    They have the sweatiest staff ever! Very friendly and knowledgeable. That gave me a positive energy.    So, with the server's suggestion I decided to try O burger with the side of poutine. It has bacon, swiss cheese, caramelized onions, mushrooms and their house sauce on it. OHH GOD! That was the best burger I've ever tried. Very juicy and tasty. My poutine was just okay. I was so stuffed with the burger, so I couldn't really eat my poutine.    I appreciated the service very much and I am definitely going to come back with my colleagues after work to have some drinks and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is on the upper side of average, atmosphere is OK. Kind of a cross between a sports bar and a lounge, this place has a bit of an identity crisis. Decor is interesting - think Victorias Secret colour scheme with lots of mirrors. The current $5 a draught beer promotion makes it the cheapest place downtown to grab a pint - even high end beers like Stiegl are on tap and only $5. Food was good but prices on the high side - around $15 for a burger or pizza. I would return as it provides a nice alternative to the crazily overcroweded beer bistro. Right now the place is quiet but with a patio and these initial beer prices I expect popularity to increase. Service was very good - in fact service was some of the best I have experienced in a while."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place.  1) ordered one of their \"great Canadian caesars\" that comes with bacon - although it doesn't come garnished at all 2) ordered a fish burger and was brought a veggie burger 3) when the fish burger came, I asked for it to go. The waitress cleared my guests dirty plates off the table while carrying my burger back to wrap up to go for me  4) when I received the burger to go, there was a nice little bug in the container! (Can be seen in the photo section if you dare)   The worst part is, the manager doesn't offer refunds. She told me I can have a new burger and when I explained to her I am already 20 minutes late coming back from lunch she said I should come back after work. (The server just got back from vacation as an excuse, and they changed the details on their drink menu. Thanks for letting me know)  $35 for a Caesar. Don't ever go here."}
{"text":"Summerlicious diners beware.... I went with a rather large group of people here for lunch to try their summerlicious menu. We were very excited to go because their menu looked simple but good. We walked in and immediately loved the decor and the vibe of the place. We were eventually given water and placed our drink orders.  Most people at our table had the calamari as an appetizer and I have to admit, it was pretty good. Another one of my friends had the salad which she said was yummy and the presentation of it was lovely. The only iffy thing that happened during this course was that someone requested some lemon to use with their calamari and the waitress brought it to her in a dirty glass.  The main course was where everything started to really go downhill.  Part 1: The Burger The majority of us ordered the burger. One person specifically asked if the burger came with any type of sauce on it and he was told by the waiter that no, it didn't. So he continued to order his burger with just cheese, lettuce and tomato on it. When he finally got his burger it had everything on it including some type of mayonnaise/sauce. He then asked our waiter to switch it as he was told that the burger was not supposed to come with sauce. The waiter took it back and then brought back another with pickles and onions on it, no cheese and no sauce. We asked the waiter to take it back again as the only thing that he wanted was a burger with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. The burger came back again, but this time we noticed that even though there was no sauce on the bun, the kitchen had replaced one of the old burger patties with sauce and stuck it on the burger. Confused yet? We called for the manager at this point and explained what happened and after 4 tries, the kitchen or our waiter, got it right. I've never seen anyone have to work so hard for a simple burger. Part 2: The salmon.  Another person in our group ordered the salmon. It was raw. We also had to call the manager for this one and she was given another \"well done.\" Dessert was interesting. People said that the tiramisu was actually good. I'd believe it, it looked good. Half of us ordered the very questionable creme brulee. I say questionable only because it was a very very cold custard with what looked like an attempt to fire the top but then fell flat because after they fired the top, they put it back in the fridge so it in essence became custard with a soggy really sweet top. It wasn't horrible but it certainly wasn't creme brulee. After all that, you'd think that the restaurant would have at least comped the cheque for the guy who had to try 4 times to get a very simple burger, and comp the girl who's salmon was raw. But no, that was a fight as well. In the end, one of them paid their bill and the other fought a long and hard battle and finally got his meal comped.  What started out as a great place turned out horrible. I definitely don't recommend eating there."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time because their burgers are great. Was lucky enough to come back today. My fave is the Amsterdam burger because it comes with a fried egg. Service is quick and with lots of personality. Bathrooms are clean. This place is great for lunch but also for all day all night drinking with your friends. Best part is that it's tucked away even though it's in plain sight. The patio is great in the summer."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. We came for Summerlicious and the service is awful!!  We asked for our reservation, and they couldn't us, so without asking us, they set us up outside. Then when we asked if we could sit inside, they gave us a firm \"No\".  The hostess is rude.  Waitresses are rude and clueless.    The appetizers came alright and were delicious.  But the service ruined it.  They also didn't clear the dishes after we were done. By the the time the mains were coming, they dishes were still there.  So and some of the mains were served and we stacked the appetizers together for them to collect.   The burger did not have any sauce and they did not offer any sauce.  My friend asked for salt and pepper but we never got it. We all had water and one of my friends asked for a refill, so the waitress turned to another table which had a pitcher at their table, and used that to fill his water. The rest of us did not get a refill.  While serving the food, the fries container almost fell on my friend.  The layout of the food isn't good.  Then we had to ask for our dessert but they just gave it to the person who asked for it and asked if the rest of us wanted it and we said yes.  My friend got his chocolate cake without a spoon.  So we had to asked for it.   Creme brûlée wasn't torched enough at the sugar part."}
{"text":"It was pretty empty on a Wednesday sports night while Beerbistro across the street was buzzing. I wanted a burger in the area and the reviews were a big help. Everything on the menu was enticing! DC and I sat at the very empty yet very comfy patio facing King St.... Awesome for date night!  DC had the Amsterdam burger with a side of salad and a tall glass of Erdinger. He enjoyed his meal but it would've been better if the egg was more runny. I had the O'burger with a side of Quebecer poutine and strongbow. The burger was delicious and juicy packed high with bacon, mushrooms and caramelized onions - I was feeling selfish and wanted to have it all! Lettuce, tomato, onions and pickle were in the side. My \"complaint\" was the burger was so big and juicy it was hard and messy too eat ;P First World Problems... Le Sigh!  The poutine was meh, gravy was too salty and cheese curds were chopped and too tiny, fries were good tho.  Service was friendly and quick... a little too quick, we felt rushed when she gave us our bill soon as we finished our food. But we stayed till they closed.  It's unfortunate that the place was empty, the burgers were totally legit! But it was nice that we had the patio all to ourselves. Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. I was really disappointed overall. I visited with a friend to try their summerlicious menu and chose this spot because they had some good reviews, but I'm sorry I did. I called to make reservations two days before my visit, left a message on their voicemail when they were still open, but no one called me back.  On the day of, I spoke with someone over the phone and confirmed the reservation. When I arrived, the place was pretty empty, but it took a while for one of the staff talking at the bar to actually come over and acknowledge us. We were asked if we had made a reservation and were immediately seated without the server checking their book.   We had three courses which were from the summerlicious menu and were never able to see their regular menu. I had the scallops that left a sandy crunch my mouth, really dry over cooked salmon, and the \"chocolate cake\" which I was told was being substituted for the tiramisu they had run out of. The dessert was the best part of the meal, and it seemed like a chocolate cheesecake. My only issue with this is that it should've been described as a cheesecake because I'm mildly lactose intolerant! Luckily it was delicious.  The service was somewhat friendly but slow.  Maybe they were short staffed, I don't know know, but I know 1 of the 4 staff members  was very busy working tables while the others didn't seem to do anything more than ignore customers.   After the appetizers, one of the servers cleaned my guest's cutlery along with her plate and she was never brought new ones. And at the end of it all it took over 15 minutes to get our bill after asking two separate times.  Sorry to say I won't be giving this place another try!"}
{"text":"I went to O Resto Lounge recently with my fiancée and I was disappointed by the food and vibe. Feels like a club but it's a burger joint. Tvs weren't set to channels for the playoffs and food tasted like it was  dethawed. For 15 dollars a burger don't bring me something that was heated up in 5 minutes and buns that are defrosted. Pass."}
{"text":"So I was at work and my co-worker recommended that I try their poutine because it was a pretty big portion size and she said it tasted good.  I walked in and it was pretty dead for a Saturday afternoon, but then again I don't expect it to be busy during the day.  It was nicely decorated with chandeliers, paintings and had big comfy lounge chairs.  I ordered take-out and went with their \"Sweet Quebecer\" which is a poutine with sweet potato fries, gravy and cheese curds.  It was something different so I decided, why not?  It came to $9 and I waited about ten minutes for my food, which wasn't too long.  I got back to work and opened up the take-out container and I was mildly disappointed by the portion size.  It was much smaller than I had imagined for the price I paid.  Overall, the taste of the poutine was mediocre.  Nothing special even with the sweet potato fries.  I'd probably be better off going somewhere else and paying that much for a better tasting poutine."}
{"text":"5 Stars.  Great spot.  Nice patio with lots of action.  Staff is awesome and always get you what you need. Stiegl pints are the play here!"}
{"text":"Great spot, great food. A friend and I decided to check it out after \"discovering\" the spot on Instagram. Couldn't resist ordering the tandoori chicken pizza (served on naan). I also had a smoked meat poutine. Gravy isn't too heavy. I added blue cheese along with the cheese curds.  Many thanks to Alex and staff. Even Toronto's Finest (boys in blue) stopped by for some grub. I'm not into the bar/club scene so this was a welcome change."}
{"text":"3.5 stars....a very reliable and reasonably priced for the financial district.  I have had the naan flatbreads (tandoori is my fave but the mushroom/bacon one is tasty also), fries, and the salads (the salmon one is my fave) - all were excellent and good for sharing.  The food won't knock your socks off / not fancy but it is consistently good.  There is a small patio in front (on King street).  Inside, there is a bar area with some TVs.  I'm not a fan of the interior (I find it dark) but I like how the resto has an overall casual/relaxed atmosphere and you can have a convo without having to yell/raise your voice.  Service can be slow (ask for the cheque early if you are in a rush).    I would recommend if you are in the neighborhood and looking for a good casual meal/drink.  While the patio at the beer bistro is better, I prefer the food and causal environment at O Resto."}
