When you call to order you are rarely out on hold, we usually pick up or order because we are so close, and it is always done very quickly and exactly how we like it. They have a great atmosphere and are always so friendly! Such a great place for pizza!"}

Definitely will come back again if we came again to Elyria. 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"First time here and I was impressed. I ordered online and it said it would be ready in 15-30 minutes. Got there in about 15 min and it was coming out of the oven. I ordered 2 calzones and they were perfect! Not only did the food taste great but the prices are very good as well. $6.50 per calzone if I remember correctly ."}

We will be back and pledge that Cozzeria is our new go-to pizza place!"}

{"text":"My Mom and I recently made a cross-country trip from California to D.C. and waited until our last couple of days to search out a good pizza. We happened through Elyria a little late for dinner, but I found Cozzeria online, and the reviews were rightfully awesome! The pizzas were delicious, and even though this is more of a pick-up place than a sit-down restaurant, the owner brought out real plates and silverware for us to one of the two or three tables and made sure we were 100% taken care of, as did the other staff. Everyone was so friendly, kind, and hospitable--and a special thanks to our new friend who shared his balloon animal talent with us! Very cool! We got two different pizzas, both delicious, and the special garlic crust is the best. Thanks so much to adding to our great road trip adventure. We'll definitely come back if wandering through again!"}
{"text":"If you stay at the local Hampton order here.   Great pizza, friendly service.   I feel like I'm supporting local.    And, with kids as a single parent they delivered to my hotel room."}
{"text":"We came all the way from Lakewood to try this place based on reviews. We like to try random new pizza every once in awhile and this was our best adventure  yet. The BBQ chicken pizza was amazing. Husband's cheese with the garlic butter was perfect. Staff so accommodating since we dined in!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever!! I'm from the East Coast where pizza is fresh, authentic, family recipe styles. Cozzeria is the closest pizza style to home.  They are not a chain, they are the real deal who take the time to get your pizza just right.  There must be about 10 other pizza places before cozzeria pizza  which is 3 miles from me, however I will never settle for the closest pizza shop, I want the best pizza!!
Great Staff, Fast Delivery!
Give them a call next time you're hungry.. Taco Pizza is a 5 star."}
