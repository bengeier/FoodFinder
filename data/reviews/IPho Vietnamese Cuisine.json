{"text":"You can tell that this place is trying to appease to a western clientele. Everything from the decor to the menus gives this a guilo-friendly vibe. The place is actually modern and clean.  Pho was average however they charged $2 for tea. No thanks.  Food: 3 Service: 3 Ambience: 4 Overall: 3 of 5 stars"}

{"text":"I think Greek town is changing into Asian town. ha!  VENUE This new restaurnt has been opened for 2 weeks and boy was it busy on a Sunday night (good thing!).  The decor was simple and chic and the whole restaurant was so nice and clean.  FOOD The food was limited. There were about 8 different items on the menu (each one was customizable). So it was very user friendly for those not use to Vietnamese food.   I thought though that the choices were very limited.  I had the typical pho with everything in it. The soup wasn't hot enough. It was just warm. I like mine steaming hot.  There wasn't enough noodles or tripe and the beef ball was 1/3 of a ball.  The soup broth was ok.   My friend had rice and chicken and literally...it was just rice and chicken. The garnishes were limited and the plate was huge that his meal looked very small.  SERVERS You could tell the servers were very new. They brought one plate over at a time. Garnish dish. Then Pho Dish, then Rice plate dish. Not a big deal if you have 2 ppl at a table but more annoying if you had a group of 4 or more.  The servers were really nice though and did appreciate your business.  PRICE I think my small Pho was $6.50"}
