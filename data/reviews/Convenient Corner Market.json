{"text":"Been coming here for years!

The people who own it are great! They are friendly, happy and run a incredible operation. They always take care to greet you by name and ask how you are doing. I have never had a bad experience there and the only time something went slightly wrong it resulted in me having a new favorite sandwich. Speaking of the sandwiches they are incredible!

This place is great! Props to Al, Marty and Sam for running such a great place!"}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, quick, and good portion size! Pleasantly surprised with the outcome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! 
Friendly staff! Best egg sandwich I have ever had!!!
This is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwich hands down...we moved from AZ  to NYC and all the Delis there left us missing Convenient  Corner Market...we are back home in AZ and  couldn't wait to get a sandwich made with your fresh bread!!!"}
{"text":"Really love this store. Marty always greets me and my friends with a smile, and then hooks us up with some quality sandwiches. The sandwiches are fantastic, made quick, and the best part is the price of the sandwich combo which includes a bag of chips and a drink. The store also hires local students so it's nice to see familiar faces and catch up with them while my sandwich is being made. It's in such a great location too that it' never a hassle to go here for some food. I fully recommend this place to anybody who lives in Scottsdale, and even anyone just passing through town looking for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  What an incredibly delicious menu they have for amazing prices!  You can get a half sandwich (which is huge), side, chips, and a drink for about $6.50.  I highly recommend the Turkey Delight and macaroni salad, they're both great.  The food and the staff are the absolute best things about this place.  This place is family owned and operated by the most amazing and friendly family.  If you go in often enough, they will recognize you.  I know there are plenty of regulars because they will greet lots of people by name.  I've been going to this place whenever I can for about 7 years, even when I lived out of town, I would always try to stop by here for lunch if I could when visiting.  The only thing I wish they had was some outdoor seating under their covered entryway during the cool times of the year.  There's a very small seating area inside, but I think most customers take out anyways (I usually do), so it's really no big deal.  I will never stop going to this place, I love the people and the food, maybe in that order!"}
{"text":"Convenient including basic's from condiments ,greeting cards, lottery .e.t.c... Primo deli severd with lots of luv & laughter. :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 15 years. It's just keeps getting better thanks Alvin and Marty. The sandwiches are great everyone is friendly and it's on a pretty convenient corner."}
{"text":"These guys rock!! Best deli sandwiches ever. The creamy basil pasta salad is excellent. Wonderful friendly staff who gets to know you as you frequent the store. Decently priced on everything. Wish I lived closer and they made special lunch deliveries to Amber in Tempe :)"}
{"text":"Great place for old school sandwiches. The owner is a HUGE South Carolina Gamecocks fan. So much so that I've heard he'll give you $1 off if you give him a \"Go Gamecocks!!\" with your order. Great little place!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Very cool place and the guy who helped me out was very nice. Great sandwich and didn't break the bank for something healthier than fast food. Will be back since the food was good and really nice people."}
{"text":"I work in this same shopping center. I needed lunch and my coworker directed me toward the convenience store like \"No, trust me.\" I was skeptical, but they were right. High-quality meats, large portions, cheap prices. Marty also has amazing recall and greets me every time I come in. 

Beer selection is pretty good as well, given the size of the deli (although my nearby job is with students so the beer is for *after* work...)."}
{"text":"The best & friendliest little market that you will find in Zona... And the sandwiches are uber delish!"}
{"text":"This place if GREAT!  We moved her from California last year and it's the only place we will get our sandwiches! !  Always fresh and friendly service!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Freshest of meats and bread. Selection is that of a high class restaurant. Probably the best Italian sub in town. You can get anything else you need from the nicest group of owners and staff you'll ever meet. Forget the bargain meals, this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend's favorite deli and he has been going for quite some time. He used to live down the street and that is how he got familiar with this place. We don't live too far but don't frequent this place that often. 

Let me start with this - my boyfriend is from the east coast where they grew up eating hoagies. I grew up eating rice and all sorts of weird things. I wouldn't say I'm a sandwich/sub/hoagie connoisseur of any sorts but he is. The bread plays a major factor. This place does it right! 

If you are in the neighborhood and you're in the mood for a quick/easy and delicious hoagie, this is your place. Bye, their macaroni salad is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Fresh! Made to order. Love this place. My daughter loves the sandwiches too!  The owners are very nice people."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches and service in scottsdale. I love the owner and his employees. Real family place and their food is the best. Cheap too!  Go there if you want an awesome Rueben or Italian sandwich and their breakfast sandwiches are to die for. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and came across this little deli.  I had the deluxe sandwich and it was done perfectly. The bread was super fresh and they put in tons of meats and cheese. I thought the price was very reasonable. If I lived closer this would definitely be my go to sandwich deli."}
{"text":"I love this market. We come in here all the time for sodas and sandwiches. I wish they had a few more items on the shelves, but love the service."}
{"text":"Best local convenience store in the valley! If you live in North Scottsdale, this should be your go-to place. Run by a family from Detroit, this store is one of those old-school places where everybody knows everyone's names; even when I don't go so often, they still remember my name at the counter! Tell me.... is there any other convenience store where they actually know your name when you walk in??? no. there is only one place, and this is it. The service here is absolutely amazing - you will walk out every single time with a smile on your face. I actually look forward to going there sometimes, if only to get a soda or lottery ticket, just because of the friendly ambiance. Now to more important things: the sandwiches. You would never expect this place, based on the outside appearance, to have one of the very best delis in town. They have a rather large sandwich menu, and use only Boar's Head meats and cheeses. Best part - they bake their own bread daily and omg it is so good! Their breakfast croissants are amongst the best I have ever had (so flakey and buttery!) and their sub rolls are just excellent. Sometimes I stop by to just get some sub rolls, if I have leftovers at home to make sammys with. The three sandwiches I recommend the most are the: beefstrami (hot beef and pastrami melt, mmmm), chicken Caesar (it's light and refreshing), and my personal fav - The Shane Doan. Named after the legendary Phoenix Coyotes captain, who is a regular at the store (he often stops by with Mike Smith and Kurt Warner even!), the sandwich that bears his name used to be \"the upside down roast beef\"... basically a beef melt. I always add a piece of cheese to it, and I love how they prepare it and top it with fresh green pepper and mustard. It really is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. 
I can't recommend this store enough - and that is solely based on the owners, as people and as businessmen - they really nailed it when it comes to neighbourhood convenience. Go for a sandwich and I guarantee you will be hooked.
Tell them Istvan sent you and say hi to Marty for me!"}
{"text":"Convenient Corner is a first class, always friendly, well stocked convenience store. 

If you are a student of numbers, as I am at my day job, get this - Thirty-eight Five Star, two Four Star and two Three Star Reviews. As close to a perfect score as you can get. 

Why?  Well, the employees and owners all want you to come back and they act that way. Tonight I stopped for some Macaroni Salad and a few other items. They greeted me like an old friend. When I need a sandwich, I come here. 

If we're next door at Basil & Garlic, we'll come here before hand to pickup some libations. Basil & Garlic is BYOB. Convenient Corner's wine section is pretty good too and they carry Bulmers (Strongbow) hard apple cider. Nice!

So \"Shop Local\" and try Convenient Corner, you'll be glad you did. 

Five Stars and then some! That will bring the total to thirty-nine, but who's counting. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not only do these guys have the best subs but they know everyone by name and what they usually buy. And they can usually have me rung up by the time I make it to the register. I love these guys! I"}
{"text":"Love their ham and cheese sandwiches! We love stopping by for a quick lunch to go! YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"Awesome deli, fresh baked bread, great beer selection, super friendly staff, glad to have these guys in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"People are friendly, breakfast and lunch sandwiches are over the top crazy good! Get the breakfast croissant. They have a great wine selection as well! A must try!"}
{"text":"Great food at great prices!  Family owned, bread cooked on premises and Boars Head Provisions!  You can't go wrong at either of their two locations!  We get breakfast sandwiches their every weekend!  You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I moved here three years ago. By far the best sandwiches in town, no question! Reasonably priced, fresh and locally owned! What more can you ask for? They also have punch cards for frequent customers ;)"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever and the nicest staff. The owner is so nice and it really feels like a neighborhood store. Loved it. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place to get a sandwich. Best Italian sandwiches in town. I love the fact that it's a no frills small convenient store but don't let that fool you. It's quality food. I also love the Mac salad. The employees are always friendly here and most of the people walking in and out seem to be regulars since they talk to the employees like long time friends. Really enjoy this place. Try it. You'll be hooked too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people gave this place five stars. Sure, the guy working was friendly, but the sandwich was unremarkable. I had a turkey sandwich and the turkey tasted old and had a weird dry texture. It just wasn't worth five stars."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh sandwiches! The prices are decently priced and is a great stop for a quick lunch break!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of all the 5 star reviews but this is my second visit and now I am a believer (and a contributor!). Everything the other reviewers have said is true so I won't rehash all the glowing remarks. If you haven't been yet or are considering going, do it. You'll be so glad you did! I'm sorry it took me 4 years to discover the amazing service, friendly people (both employees and customers), and delicious sandwiches. This is now my favorite go-to sandwich stop."}
{"text":"This is the spot! Friendly neighborhood market. Been coming here for over ten years. It's family owned and ran with love and professionalism. I get greeted by first name every time I enter the store. Basically all the daily needs are sold here and as a bonus they have the best sandwiches around."}
{"text":"Little Italy meets the heart of Scottsdale, Arizona. Labeled as a convenient market with some of the best subs outside of New York City. Bread made in house with the freshest and finest deli cuts by Borehead. My favorite is the turkey delight with extra pickles. It's a must try if you're in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Visiting our adult kids, ran in for lunch for everyone (they come in a lot)...since I asked a couple questions, he asked if I'd been in before, thanked me for coming in,was so friendly!!  Rare to find even a small business that is so friendly and appreciative of customers!  Plus, the food portions are very generous and delicious!!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the corner store. This is my favorite place to go for croissants and I love the sandwiches! Everyone is always so welcoming, I've been going to the corner store for 8 years now."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I've had in AZ so far. Everything is super fresh, prices are low. Seems like a convenience store but really more of a deli/grocery. Cute place and very welcoming. I just moved to the area and will be there a lot more!"}
{"text":"Best Deli in town! Been coming here for years, as Alvin, Brooke, Marcus and the whole crew do a fantastic job, as good as any place in town. We had places like this on every corner in Bklyn where I grew up. This is how a neighborhood Deli / store should be, not enough of them in AZ.

It's the \"Cheers\" of Deli / convenience stores. Everyone knows everyone and you feel welcome ALL the time. The staff and customers talk sports all day, super cool atmosphere, etc.The food is AWESOME, all Boars Head meats, fresh baked bread every day, and they can custom tailor sandwiches to what ever you want - they way it should be. Service is FAST, they never disappoint.

It's also well located so you don't need to deal with the massive congestion in the Shea Blvd and 92nd street area - a nightmare. Even if that was not an issue, their quality and portions are way better than any chain stores. 

You'll never eat at a chain store after going here. People drive from 20 miles away to come and eat here everyday - no B.S.

{"text":"We were looking for a non-commercial chain sandwich shop with really good food. After reading the reviews, we stopped in to the store for a sandwich and a breakfast croissant around 9 a.m. in the morning. We made sure to introduce ourselves to Al and his wife, after reading what fantastic people they are, and all reviews are spot-on! Al took the time to review the menu with us, the different brands and types of food they have available and discussed with us their fresh bread and croissants that they bake every day. The breakfast croissant, as well as the roast beef sandwich, was amazing in perfect quality and perfect quantity! Seating inside was convenient! Also a very well-stocked store! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich shop in AZ!!
I had the Alvin Big Boy Special - Italian on homemade bread with Double Mayo & Double Meet!!!
I would have taken a picture,  but I already ate the whole thing. 
Great food don't tell everyone about our hidden little gem in Scottsdale or it will get very crowded.
Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"This little gem is a new favorite of ours. We are new to the neighborhood and we love stopping in here for lunch or to grab something quick that we forgot to buy at the grocery store. The staff are always friendly and greet you promptly when you walk in. They even know most customers by name. The sandwiches are a great value and you never have to wait long for them to be made. Great business-- we have been and will continue to be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are really good and the staff is friendly. Everyone in the neighborhood loves these guys for a reason. This is what customer service should be like."}
{"text":"As it was mentioned in a previous review, this place IS basically a convenience store with sandwich makers standing by.  So pretty much take a 7/11 or a comparable \"kwike mart\" that is over crowded with run of the mill convenience products and stick a deli case in it with a modest display of only Boars Head products (as if Boars Head is the end-all/be-all of gourmet deli) put a menu above it with typical selections of sandwiches and salads and there you have Convenient Corner Market.  The prices are in the middle.  The quality of my sandwiches was good but not uniquely good.  If you are planning a visit, I'd suggest calling ahead to avoid waiting longer than one would expect while dodging people just trying to buy some smokes, a tall boy, and a scratcher
+'s:  fresh tasting bread, family owned and operated, somewhat decent selection of beer/wine
-'s:  limited selection, long wait, could be cheaper, just \"ok\" sandwiches"}
{"text":"First time! I really liked this place! The service was great and the sammich was solid. I ordered the Italian to go with the mac salad, chips and a soda. I thought it was a great deal. Next time I will have the dude church up my sammich to include some hot peppers maybe but overall I am super impressed!  It was made exactly as described on the menu. I strolled the store while I waited and it has a really nice selection. Its what I would call a party store I guess. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"May offer some of the best subs in town...fresh and delicious! Love their sub rolls, they were soft but had a nice crust. Very clean and well organized, you can tell they care about their business. Super nice & friendly people working behind the counters & making the sandwiches...the folks working seemed like family and you could tell they care about the business & product. Pretty refreshing to find a place like this nowadays! I wish I lived in this neighborhood...I'd eat & shop there everyday!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years and no matter how many sandwich shops pop up in the valley, I still always say that convenient corner makes the best sandwiches I have had. The boar's head meat is fantastic, the bread is delicious, everyone who works here is so incredibly friendly, and it's tucked away in a neighborhood so you don't get the annoying foot traffic or loud morons talking on their cell phones. Just an excellent sandwich. I'll be singing this place's praises for years to come."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches around (Boars Head meat) and fresh baked sub rolls!  Beer selection is second only to BevMo.  Always treated like family when im there."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here before, definitely get the beefstrami if you're craving a hot sammy or the Italian for a refreshing cold cut. I'm from the area and I'm not ashamed to admit I ate here 4-5 days a week. Now that I'm in Tempe I can't make it in as often but it's a must stop when visiting north Scottsdale. They're the coolest guys to talk sports with while you wait for sandwiches. Tell them go dbacks for me if you stop in."}
{"text":"There are not many places in the valley that offer the authentic tastes this place does. It's just a convenient store with a deli counter. Although...behind that counter they make great tasting subs. Their Italian Sub tastes exactly like the Subs we would get at our favorite deli in New York City. They deliver most of the time but if you have to drive it's worth every mile. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches on the best subroll ever!  Don't miss out!   Always friendly & nice!  I was raised in Scottsdale and I unfortunately don't live in the neighborhood, however, when I'm driving out to visit family, I always stop by for a sammy and a few extra rolls to go!  Thank you!!!  Keep up the great food & service!"}
{"text":"Sandy's are bomb and staff is friendly! My fave is the Italian with pepper jack cheese!
So happy I live so close to this spot!"}
