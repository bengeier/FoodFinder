{"text":"Took my mom on mother's day.  Great place, fun atmosphere, wonderful service and the food was delicious.  They even gave moms a small box of chocolates to celebrate!  Would definitely return.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday morning, so we were seated right away.  Good food.  Huge selection.  Good coffee.  They leave the pot of coffee on the table, so you can have lots of refills.  Friendly staff.  I like this place."}
{"text":"They offer military and law enforcement discounts. 10%. Food is average. They have a lot choices."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast joint. Have been here a few times and food never disappoints. Staff is nice.  Coffee is good."}
{"text":"Yet another lovely breakfast! The staff here are really nice and wonderful! Very clean and well organized. I definitely recommend coming out here if you haven't already. Ask for Kaitlyn she's very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was a  20-25 min wait but that is expected on a Sunday morning. We started off with coffee & hot chocolate.  The hot chocolate is dessert in a cup YUM!!  One friend ordered the Macho Nacho Benedict, the other friend ordered Lumberjack Scramble &  I ordered the Florentine Benedict.  It was a bit before the food was served. My friends enjoyed their meals.  Mine was ok but incomplete.  It lacked the the diced bacon and tomatoes.  I waited a few minutes expecting the waitress would stop by but she didn't.  My friend had to make several requests to get a couple of items before the waitress brought them.    Overall the food was good.  Service needs improvement a) once your guest has been served follow up within 3-5 min make sure its ok b) if a guest has to ask for something a 2nd time make sure to take care of that request on the spot.  A guest should not have to ask a 3rd or 4th time to get what was requested.  Although our waitress was very pleasant she would benefit from a little more training.  Fortunately these are training issues and easily resolved.  Therefore, when in town again would give this place another try."}
{"text":"This place can't seem to get efficient wait staff.  Slow, slow, slow.  This is the third time in as many visits I've had a problem.  I've been sitting here for 20 minutes before coffee served, going on 30 minutes and still no food.  One visit they messed up our order with the next table and that table ended up buying or breakfast.  Another time we were totally ignored for 20 minutes.  This is the first time I've ever been compelled to leave a negative review in my life."}
{"text":"This cozy little breakfast and lunch spot is exactly what I needed this morning.  Having recently returned back from a business trip in Palm Springs where the food and service at the local IHOP was sub-par at best, I set out this morning for a quality breakfast with good service.  My server was outstanding and promptly welcomed me with a fresh pot of coffee.  The menu offers an item for everyone, including those hungry for lunch.  Without hesitation, I decided on the Mexi-Cali Burro (burrito) which promptly put me into a food-coma. Guacamole, sautéed spinach, mushroom, onion, red bell pepper & green chilies in a tomato basil wrap topped w/melted cheeses, salsa, Pico de Gallo, black olives, sour cream & fresh cilantro. Served on a bed of black beans w/sides of Ancho Chili & Veracruz sauces.  Yum-Yum!!!!!  Highly recommend The Good Egg for a great breakfast with great service.   http://www.thegoodeggaz.com/"}
{"text":"Good food, great staff. There is usually a bit of a wait whenever we go but that is our fault for waiting around and getting stuck in the church crowd."}
{"text":"Very dissappointed. Had the Loca la vida, the salsa that came with it was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted. I mentioned it to the waitress and she said that others had made the same comment. Well maybe you shouldn't serve it then, Hello! OJ was good but Expensive $2.95 for a lrge OJ."}
{"text":"Follow up visit after previous disappointments. I can't say enough about the turn around in food from previous visits. After receiving an invite from management I finally returned with my wife. Not expecting much I was pleasantly surprised. I love eggs and I ordered 3 over medium with hash browns, bacon and sourdough toast. I received what I would call one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Eggs were perfectly cooked with real hash browns, some of the best bacon I've ever had and sourdough toast that pulled this altogether into one fine breakfast. I won't go into my wife's order but it was as excellently prepared as mine. Based on this visit I will be returning very soon and hopefully this will turn into my favorite breakfast spot. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. I work next door and I love getting a to-go order.   The customer service is always great. I az also have my customers at my shop complimenting The Good Egg."}
{"text":"I know this place is usually really good but today was a major fail. The place was half empty, we got cold coffee, our waiter forgot about two of the drinks, and when we finally got our food after waiting so long, my eggs were cold. I've never heard a waiter say \"sorry about that\" so many times...not just to our table but to others around as well. They were not having a good day :( and I went home and made my own food."}
{"text":"It is not Sunday morning if we didn't go to The Good Egg. They have a great selection of interesting dishes, its all very affordable and they have a frequent visitor program so every 6th meal is free!   Steven is by far the best waiter they have, though everyone is very friendly and most remember your name/face.   I am sad to see this place getting closed, though the new location on Happy valley isn't too far away."}
{"text":"OMG....just had the best Golden Gate scramble ever!  And much to my surprise, I love the new Kale Tonic!  I highly recommend both!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place at all. I took my family there on a Monday around 9 am and order basic menu items. The server was not attentive to our table. That is not even the worst part. We order French toast mean that consisted of one piece of bread. I can get better French toast at Denny's and at least they serve adult portions. We ordered kids meal pancake and the first pancake came out still gooey in the middle. The bacon we asked for extra crispy came out chewy. It then took them 15 minutes to remake one pancake and when it came out again it was still uncooked in the middle and burnt on the outside. Breakfast is a hard meal to mess up but this place sure messed it up."}
{"text":"We were looking for another breakfast place to eat besides IHOP or Danny's so I found this place on Yelp, read the reviews and we decided to check it out. So glad we did b/c this place was so good and so amazing. For sure we'll come back and try more of the menu. The Hot Juan was delicious as well as their coffee. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing! They did not plan their staffing correctly for Presidents Day and were overwhelmed. The restaurant was maybe 2/3 full. Our waitress was not friendly and needs customer service training. We ordered breakfast and it took 1hour and 10 minutes until our food arrived. Unfortunately, 3 out of 7 orders were cold and had to be sent back to the kitchen. My main problem was with the waitress. In the hour that we waited, she never came back to let us know how long the food would take, never refilled our drinks, and did not even offer the 5 children at the table as much as a crumb while we waited. When we asked how much longer it would take, she became defensive and not professional. The manager was very kind and brought a couple of fruit dishes for the kids."}
{"text":"Me and wife have been going to the good egg since 2010, and this good egg since it opened.  This use to be our favorite place, close to home, gym and good food.  However, they have really gotten worse and worse for the past few months.  The service is hit and miss, the wait staff his also hit and miss.  We went on sunday march 6 and had to wait for food for over 30 minutes, food was cold and did not taste as good as usual, and the service was the worse.  We plan on going to biscuits or haymakers from now on.  Or Cracker Barrel, they are at least consistent"}
{"text":"Just finished eating at the Good Egg. I ordered the Eye Opener combo with French Toast (1 slice), scrambled eggs & sausage (3 links). The eggs had no flavor for supposedly being locally grown fresh eggs. This tasted like egg beaters to me. The toast also no flavor for being cinnamon french toast. ..where was the cinnamon?  The sausage was the best part it was actually very good!! I opted to return it & they were happy to take it off the bill & asked if I'd like anything else off the menu even offering some bacon. All this was great & appreciated but opted to not reorder. Return factor = not likely"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We have been regular customers of the 29th Ave and Bell location for years. That location had the very best wait staff you could ask for. They were all so friendly and very observant to your needs. They closed and opened up on Happy Valley. Well upon the first visit we were excited to see our usual waitstaff and service and food was excellent as always. the next two times we did not see our usual waitstaff and the food was so so.  It is obvious that the new waitresses are being nice because they have to be nice. This last visit, we had to ask for water 3 times,( I never had to ask for water with the original staff...they asked me)  the eggs were over cooked and again with the forced kindness. I am very sad that we have lost our perfect breakfast spot. Even the perfect bacon was not perfect this time. Not sure what happened there it was over cooked just like the eggs. The price is too high to have this experience. We may as well eat at Denny's."}
{"text":"Egg-celent!! Service was fast and friendly. Food was exactly as ordered and delicious. Even the plates were heated so our food stayed hot!! Absolutely no complaints!"}
{"text":"The pluses:    The food was reliable Good Egg food.  Great portions, great taste, great price.  The server kept up with our crazy speed of going through pots of coffee.  The bummers:  The host (some super old lady) tried to put a party of six (which included 3 people over 6 ft tall) in a booth meant to only comfortably seat 4. Even though there were empty tables EVERYWHERE.  For the volume of business the place was doing at the time the Kitchen was pretty damn slow.  Server seemed overwhelmed at times. We asked for one item 4 times and never received it.  He was nice enough though.   Overall.  Still nothing beats the service of the Tucson Good Egg. But this one ranks as one of the oddest level of service for one visit off all the Phx locations.  Half great Half crappy all in one visit."}
{"text":"Love this place so much got to meet another great server today! April left early for a meeting of some sort and we still got the best service by this great waitress named Kaitlyn she informed this is not her normal location she's just helping out today! I think she should come here more often she would be a good addition to this wonderful good egg location."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. This place does not live up to the hype. Very expensive for mediocre at best. Do yourself a favor and cook breakfast at home."}
{"text":"I'm not a big breakfast food fan, but this is the one place we always go to when visiting family out in Phoenix.  Ambiance is good and service is decent.  They have a nice outdoor seating area, which is enjoyable.    They have a bunch of egg/omlette options.  They have $1 pancakes on their specials menu- definately order one or order a few.  They melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I'm having a good streak of pleasant experiences lately. Here for breakfast today and was pleasantly greeted and sat. Super friendly server and 100% efficient. Pancakes and eggs benedict were excellent. They do tend to undertoast the muffins at all good eggs so if you want it toasty remember to specify when ordering. My coffee at home is way better but it is adequate here. Good place and should be on your breakfast list. ......cat just jumped on me so that is all."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Amazing service and love they keep a big jug of coffee at the table. GREAT SKILLETS!!! Come with a big appetite! Pancakes are great as well!"}
{"text":"I always get the Wildcat Omlette, comes with country potatoes and warm corn tortillas, it's really good. My kids always get one of their french toast or pancake combos. Their service overall is pretty fast but they're so busy that they probably just have to be able to keep up with the customer turnover."}
{"text":"Setting:  The wifey and I usually come here at least two times a month to enjoy our local businesses while not having to worry about cooking breakfast.  Ambiance:  There is a good amount of outside and inside seating.  We have never had to wait for more than 10 or 15 minutes for a table.  It is a cozy area, and perfect for a small or big group of people to start off their Saturday!  Food/Menu:  There are many choices to choose from, and each breakfast person will definitely find what best fits their style.  I am definitely a sweet person for breakfast whereas my wife loves savory.  Therefore, I will highlight our favorite sweet and savory dish!  4 Peaks French Toast - So sweet and so good, which is why it is about 1300 calories.  Don't let the small amount of fruit fool you, as the caramelized pecans, caramel sauce, cream cheese frosting, powdered sugar, and whipped cream soothe your sweet taste buds.  Delicious, but is it worth the calories?  Just make sure you parked far away for a long walk back.  Service:  The service has always been above average, which is why we love coming back.  We have no complaints and the waiters and waitresses do an excellent job to start your day!  Overall:  The Good Egg supplies you with what a great breakfast restaurant is all about: various food choices, plenty of coffee, a pleasant wait, and a good hearty meal to start your day.  Therefore, Good Egg, we will be seeing you again!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! The service was REAL service! everyone very nice and attentive. plus our server Diana was a rock star! The Sunrise Benedict was cooked perfect! Hollandaise sauce light, creamy and not too heavy. Love the organic hot sauce on the potatoes. Coffee was so smooth and we were given huge to go cups! New favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"WE are new to AZ & our adult kids came to visit for the weekend.  Took them here for breakfast this morning, Labor Day, and have no complaints whatsoever.  Great food, fast service!!  My son is rather picky about his food and how it's prepared but he had nothing but good things to say."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy are amazing!  The biscuits were so light and fluffy!  The bacon was also delicious. There was a short wait but they had coffee available so that was a bonus. The place is bright and clean. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks after it opened. The food was good, service was slow. I had to ask my waitress three times to bring more cream fro my coffee. BUT, I gave it another shot and I'm glad I did. The server was very attentive. But really, it's just your standard Good Egg breakfast."}
{"text":"Okay, the Good Egg/First Watch has some major issues. We have been eating breakfasts for years at the Good Egg. Great menu, charming decor, fast service, dependable food. They started a little over a year ago streamlining their menu. For a while they would still make a few dishes that the old menu had on it. But then that stopped. Then there were rumors that The Good Egg had been bought out by First Watch. Hmmm...I'd been to First Watch numerous times and was not particularly impressed. So now the full transition from The Good Egg to First Watch seems to be complete. NOT Good. We have been at three locations within the last three weeks. First was at our usual location Carefree Highway just off the I-17. We were shocked. Gone were the charming decor and now there's this cavernous so-called rustic chic decor: lots of fake wood plank floors and walls, removal of most of the cozy booths with these uncomfortable half booths (one side up against the wall the other side chairs) and an open lounge area that supposedly makes it look inviting. It's not. Those waiting for a seat are wide open to peer on the diners. Worst of all it what has happened to the kitchen?!!! It's ridiculously slow service. Two times within a week, once for lunch, once for breakfast both on non-holiday weekdays we waited a ridiculously long time for our food. They were not busy at all. Our server seemed overwhelmed with the few tables she was waiting on. We had never seen her before (new help?) The food was nothing to write home about and I'm still waiting for my salsa. Someone forgot how to scramble eggs. Chunks of rubbery yet runny whites not mixed in with the yellow yokes...yuk! I felt like a kid picking at my meal. Oh well. We decided we wouldn't go back. So then we go to 39th Avenue and Happy Valley location hoping it was jusst a fluke last Thursday. Same thing. As we were waiting for our food another very unhappy couple passed their waitress with their order of food in her  arms and said, \"You can take that back. We are leaving.\". I then overheard them telling the hostess they were upset about the slow service. Our waitress came by three times thanking us for our \"patience\" and that our food should be right out. Husband got standard egg, waffle, bacon meal which was ok. I made a big mistake and order the Crepe-Eggs. Talk about not knowing what you're supposed to be! Mine was a dried and over-cooked rubbery crepe stuck to a hard, flattened tasteless egg whites folded over a few veggies. The menu said it was served with poppy seed dressing which I didn't get and requested salsa on the side. I waited forever with my food getting colder and even less appealing for the requested salsa. We were about to leave when our harried waitress appeared with the salsa offering an apology. We don't believe in making the servers pay for crappy food and poor kitchen management so she did receive our usual 20% tip. I didn't complain to the hostess, feeling her to be unable to make any changes. I do have the manager's card and will be giving her a call. Another older, unaccompanied diner came in and said he usually sat at the counter to eat and read the paper. Since that was GONE he got plunked down at a rectangular high top table that sat 6 or 8. Within a few minutes another solo diner got seated at the other end. AWKWARD to say the least.   So call us stupid or hopeful, but within a few days coming back from an early doctor's appts on Thomas Road we stopped in at the location on the I-17. Again, same cold decor, same so-so food and an interminable wait. Our server was most pleasant...we felt sorry for him.   Obviously the corporate decision to re-brand The Good Egg into First Watch as far as decor goes would have been something we could have gotten used to. But sub-par food and slow kitchen service is not something we need to fork out over $30 for breakfast for. We are retired and we eat out frequently...we will just have to find another favorite. So sad."}
{"text":"The food and service was outstanding!  We will be back! Our meals were fresh flavorful and well prepared.  Love the syrup!"}
{"text":"Still a fan.  Service was great.  On a whim went for lunch. I had the tuna fish.  too much mayo and lacked seasoning.  Couldn't even finish it.  So why 4 stars?  They reduced our bill significantly, double stamped, and truly apologetic.  We'll continue to go, in fact they were so professional we are customers for life. Will stick to breakfast though."}
{"text":"Husband ordered an inlet with extra chorizo. It had itno chorizo.  The presented the wrong bill  No apologies. Medical burro had lots less chicken and a dry tortilla. Disappointing visit."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We go here every week and are treated just like family. Our favorite waitress Joanne, knows our preferences and makes great suggestions for something new to try. My suggestion is to not miss out on the RASPBERRY WHITE CHOCOLATE PANCAKES...DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I wasn't that excited about the breakfast I had. We had the breakfast skillet and the kids had pancakes nothing I tried here was rememberable. I'll have to give it another chance since its in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"First Watch Happy Valley is our First Choice do Sunday breakfast!! And Debra is OUR server!!  She is always smiling, happy to see us and prompt to serve. We don't go anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"When I saw this location had no reviews, I decided that was simply unacceptable.  The first time I went it was busy (as it has been every time since), so I went in and put my name in the queue.  The hostess was very friendly to me and said we'd be seated shortly.  I walked outside with my guest and we enjoyed some of the coffee they set out when there's a long line.  A few minutes later, the server calls out over the loudspeaker and we walk in behind a couple who had just arrived.  The man who just walked in front of us walks up to the server and says, \"You just called me. I'm the guy you just called.\"  The hostess, bless her, says, \"I think the gentleman right behind you might disagree.\"  I will tell you, the look on that jerk's face was nearly as delicious as the food here.  TGE specializes in exactly what you think it does.  Salad.  I mean, eggs!  Eggs!  I've been here many many times and while my cholesterol might not thank me, my palate does.  Everything I've had has been fresh and well made.  I like eggs, so I get a bit cranky when cooks overdo their omelets because they can't get them to hold together or when your over easy is over medium to over hard because, well, eggs are hard to do.  I have never had anything less than excellent here.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because their sides are such a letdown by comparison to their eggy masterpieces.  The potatoes are fine, but I've had better in greasy spoon diners back in Buffalo.  All in all, I recommend it quite highly for a late breakfast/brunch.  The weekends are busy and they don't take reservations then, so make sure you get there early."}
{"text":"Taking my two favorite breakfast places from Florida and Arizona and you get one Good Egg First Watch! And they kept the Bananas Presley. High five to one of my favorite places that brings me back to Tampa."}
{"text":"If you really like Denny's you'll love this. Just not for me, I didn't find anything special here.."}
{"text":"Excellent omelets and super friendly staff.  Good place for watching the calories as they post them on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat breakfast here on Sunday mornings and love it. Great people and service."}
{"text":"Loved the food, there was a small problem and was handled immediately by manager.I respect abd would go back because she's cared enough to fix it. I'd go back if ever on that area again."}
{"text":"The servers were really friendly. I ordered the Macho Nacho and it was huge! Super yum. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I haven't been a real Good Egg fan for several years, but our recent visit to the Happy Valley location changed that. I'm a server, so I can be pretty critical...but I have to say that our server Danielle gave us THE most perfect service I've had in 35 years of dining out as an adult. My omelet was perfect, so were my requested crispy potatoes. We asked Danielle for several things and she got them immediately and with a friendly smile. She might have been thinking, \"There's nothing worse than waiting on other servers\", but that was never reflected in her face. I don't think I've ever told a server that they were perfection before! The busser Gabby was awesome, as well, and the people at the front were also nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop!  The eggs were cooked good.  New place.  Clean and casual."}
{"text":"I stopped at this new location for lunch a week ago and was very pleased I did.  I had the BLT and was very pleased, not only with the BLT but they had a low fat salad dressing that was really tasty.....roasted bell pepper.....delicious!  They also give the calories for every item (including salad dressing) so you know what your eating and can help you make a healthier decision if you choose.  I thought the service was very good and this location is brand new and very clean.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We got the lumberjack breakfast-one of the best breakfast meals I've had and the biscuits are to die for. Kids loved the pancakes. Only bummer is they were out of French toast-my favorite! Still, they made me cinnamon and sugar crepes which satisfied my sweet tooth. Coming back for French toast soon though! Great place for families and service was great. Highly recommend a try!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and enjoyed.  Very healthy choices!   Clean rest rooms, good service and reasonable prices.  BUT, we learned a lesson today, don't come on the weekend when it is busy as the food is just not prepared as well."}
{"text":"I love the Good Egg. They have delicious yet healthy options for breakfast, brunch, and lunch.  The only down side is the service is not so great."}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was great! The people are friendly and took care of their guest! We were visiting fri out of town and I found the waiters service to be prefect! The place is very Roomy and there was outside seating and inside also. Although there were a lot of flys flying around it was a bit annoy seating outside. I enjoy my meal 100% and love it so much.. I would go back if I was in town."}
{"text":"Love love love restaurants that do their thing to perfection! This place delivers!  We visited during Superbowl XLIX while cheering our World Champion Patriots!  Our hotel recommend this place, and I must admit, I'm not often a fan of chain restaurants as often the chain style restaurant managers don't put forth the commitment and effort to make their local restaurant experience amazing. So I had this thought in my head as we made our trek to this place.  Boy, was I wrong! This place simply does breakfast extremely well. We ordered Huevos Rancheros, 2 eggs any style atop fresh potatoes with corn tortilla strips, black beans, melted cheeses, sour cream & pico de gallo. Served with flour or corn tortillas & salsa. Simple dish - made to perfection.  So good in fact, we ate there back-to-back-to-back - 3 times, ordered this exact breakfast each time. Seriously! It was that good! Also, got the same waiter two of the three times - he was friendly, attentive, and funny.   I wish we had this place near my home... I'd be a regular.   Well done Good Egg!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast! Great prices, friendly staff, & yummy food! I can be a difficult customer due to my diet requirements, but this restaurant has no problem substituting items to make healthier meals. Best part is even after substituted with all the healthy options  the food is still excellent! Plus the fresh juices are great too!"}
{"text":"Headed over here after being referred to this location by a Starbucks' barista in the area. She told us how nice the manager is and how she eats there regularly and we have been looking for local hot spots, so a referral is always welcome!   There was a bit of a wait, but less than what we guesstimated based on the line outside.  Ten minutes later we were seated inside and our waitress came over for drink orders within a couple minutes. Both meals were good overall, although the French Toast was an odd texture - toasty outside, but soggy in the middle. The corned beef hash was extremely tasty and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  The inside had some fun decor and despite how busy it was the service was quick and efficient.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not good. Service took forever. We didn't even get our water till 15 minutes after we sat down. My eggs were over cooked and when I told them she offered to remake them, but I wasn't waiting another 30 minutes for 2 eggs.30 bucks for a bad meal and service.  Not going back. I rather wait at a good place for better service and food."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning with a group of 5. We ended up waiting around 25 minutes which wasn't too bad. I wasn't expecting much from this place as we went there as plan B when our first choice restaurant had an hour long wait.   Anyway, I had 2 whole wheat pancakes, with scrambled eggs and 4 turkey sausage patties. The pancakes were a little heavy, but still tasty and came with a dollop of whipped butter on top. My scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly-- I hate runny eggs, so that wasn't an issue here. The turkey sausage patties were my favorite part! Brown up nicely on both sides and they were seasoned well, not bland at all like some turkey sausage varieties.   Overall: everyone at our table was happy with their food. They had omelets, biscuits and gravy, french toast, and a stack of blueberry pancakes.   I liked that they had a variety of healthy options such as whole wheat pancakes, turkey sausage, and things to add in  your pancakes such as protein powder and wheat germ. There was also a portion of the menu dedicated to \"healthy-light\" breakfast options."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, decent prices.  This place seems like a locals breakfast spot based on the clientele. I was please with my Florentine Benedict plate. Flavor was spot on. Quantity was just right and the presentation was visually pleasing.   Good job Good Egg!"}
{"text":"X3 kids breakfast with six eggs sunny side up each one with hashbrowns or pancakes and Bacon around $5 each, cheaper than McDonald's. I am glad I don't have to fry bacon in the house ever again."}
{"text":"It was delicious! Service was very attentive, my server had great timing every time I needed something she would shoot out from underneath the table with my requested item. Obviously that is exaggeration lol she was really good. Had the eye opener with the side kick of a crepe the  eggs were cooked perfectly! My friend had the macho nacho! Very macho . Next time I'll make sure to try there Juice bar, the ambiance was very LA outside seating, music, natural food well maybe not LA but anywho it was good!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's new and less crowded. Everyone is very friendly. No one is rushing you. Food is amazing. Love the patio."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice atmosphere. My first visit to this location. Our server Jason was top-notch. I ordered the Traditional Breakfast, and my husband ordered the Eye Opener.    Good:  Eggs were cooked perfectly. Biscuit was fluffy, gravy was tasty, coffee was hot and  served with a pot on the table. Hash browns were cooked well. Four slices of bacon with breakfast. Great service and friendly staff. Nice decor and atmosphere.   Room for improvement:  Bacon was bland and chewy.  My husband's pancakes were ok, but a little dense and flat.   I plan to return. Hoping it was just an off day on bacon."}
{"text":"Good service, ordered the eggs benny, it was served promptly, but the sauce was bland, unremarkable. No flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent of the business to invite me back to try them again. Unfortunately I can't say they are as good as when they were just the Good Egg. I had my old fav eggs florentine and it was very good but a little different. No asparagus but I liked the big mushrooms and onions. Eggs perfectly cooked. Potatoes were pretty boring. Coffee excellent. Service friendly but slow."}
{"text":"Not so \"hot\". Really not so hot.   Slow service. Cold food. Badly cooked eggs.    Maybe they need more practice.    They are new."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is consistently good and they have a great variety. I am personally a mexi-breakfast fan and love my eggs with salsa, and they have a nice homemade one here with a lot of flavor. The dollar side options make for nifty add-ons, like the recent pumpkin pancakes!  Be prepared to wait on any weekend morning, every one I have been to in the Valley is busy! Sad that they closed the location closest to me on Bell Rd., but I like them so much I will still drive further away for their morning grub!"}
{"text":"Good Egg is always very good (eggceptional?), and this location is even nicer than most.  It's new and very clean, with a spacious patio and lots of huge booths for comfort.  Service was quick, and everything was prepared perfectly.  Good value for the price/quality."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We go here for breakfast all the time and it's always amazing and great prices"}
{"text":"The Good egg it was the worst service I have ever had in my entire life. We're  visiting here from New Mexico  I am my wife decided to have breakfast before we head back  The atmosphere the restaurant was nice.  We got seated quickly. And then it went to shit.  We waited 35 minutes before   The table next to us got the order first and we were there 15 minutes to 20 minutes before they were.  I know the people that sat next to us pay their bills just as well .  All I know is I would never step foot in any of their status meant ever again."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. The waiter was knowledgeable and cared that it was our first time there. Asked him about a few dishes and he went into DETAIL about them. Had a good time."}
{"text":"I went hiking the morning I visited the Good Egg so I was a bit of a sweaty mess when I arrived.  No one seemed to mind this at all.  I sat outside (bonus points for lovely outdoor seating) and was served promptly.  I had the breakfast tacos with egg whites and a side of black beans.  The tortillas were tasty, the eggs were cooked perfectly (very important) and overall I enjoyed the food and felt it was a good value for what I was paying.  They have a nice menu, lots of choices from the healthy to the decadent."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast chain. The food was tasty and came out quickly but it just wasn't anything special.   We had the lumberjack skillet and the buttermilk pancakes. The skillet was pretty good after a healthy dose of hot sauce, and the pancakes were also pretty fluffy and good.   If you're looking for a low key, quick and easy breakfast, this place isn't bad....."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the revamped look inside The Good Egg. It gives you that rustic farm / farmers market fresh feel! The food was delicious as always! My wife and I both had the Bacado omelette with a side of the dollar pancakes! The staff, food and experience was good as always and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"When a Starbucks barista recommends a place for breakfast, you go there! That was the case with The Good Egg. We were searching for a place to eat and struck up a conversation with our barista and she didn't hesitate to say to go here.  We had a bit of a wait (maybe 10-15 min.) and we were seated inside. There were plenty of options for every type of breakfast eater and it was difficult to settle on just one thing to order. I opted for the French toast with corned beef hash. The hash was delicious and cooked really well with spices that matched it. The French toast was just okay, since the inside of it was under-cooked and a touch soggy compared to the outer parts of it. I'd skip the toast next time and do pancakes with hash!  The staff was friendly and doing well keeping up with the morning rush. We were able to order, eat, and get out in a timely manner without feeling rushed either!  Overall: A A great recommendation from a favorite barista!"}
{"text":"Really great place! We used to frequent the location in Mesa, but the manager was a total witch! I am serious--my bf, at the time, and I would go there, weekly, and she would never acknowledge us, or even attempt to be polite to the customers, so we stopped going. I am glad we gave the Bell Rd. location a try. The service was excellent! We were greeted, with a big smile, and seated immediately. Our server was excellent. Food is great. We always order the same thing, a skillet for me and Eye Opener Combo for the hubster. We are definitely excited to welcome this franchise back in to our rotation of wonderful breakfast joints!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast and smoothies. Very tasty good generous portions. This is my go to for breakfast. Nice outdoor seating that is dog friendly"}
{"text":"I have been here about five times since this restaurant opened since I live nearby.   Some experiences have been good, some bad.  I will start with the good.   The food, for the most part,  is fine.   I have only had a couple of bad things on the menu.    Items I recommend: Egg White & the 7 Veggies omelette, The Works omelette, Sunrise Benedict, any of the Pancakes, the turkey sausage., ham steak, Arizona Scramble and the fresh squeezed OJ is great.   I would not recommend the Three cheese omelette (literally about one tablespoon of cheese on the top, no cheese inside the omelette).  Also, the country potatoes can be hard, dry and old.   Make sure you request a fresh batch.    Now for the bad.   The service can be just horrendous.   One time we waited so long to be greeted that we almost walked out.   The server was training a new hire and apparently never bothered to see if he had been sat any tables.   The restaurant was not even that busy.   The manager never does any table visits, he is always eating at the counter.  They could do better if they tried a little harder."}
{"text":"Went here two weeks ago for breakfast and forgot to add my review! I've been to a few different locations around the valley but this is the one closest to me. I've eaten here every once in awhile for many, many years. One of the best places for Eggs Benedict. Two toasted English muffins topped with a sweet grilled ham, two perfectly poached eggs, and an amazing Hollandaise sauce. They also have a few different varieties of Benedict but I like to go traditional. Add a side of \"country\" potatoes for $1 if you get the regular Benedict because it's not included.  Also has good house coffee with cream and a selection of sweeteners. Good service but it's a small place and can get pretty packed with a long line to get in so get there early, especially on Sunday mornings - though they do have self-serve coffee outside to help with the wait."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, nice attentive service. The food was good - high quality and prepared well. The service timely and provided with a smile.  I'm going back again this morning."}
{"text":"The Pueblo was amazingly delicious! For those brave of heart and strong intestinal strength ask for fresh jalapeños in the mix. Off the hook!!!  Excellent food. Service was good and ambiance is nice and relaxed. Recommend!"}
{"text":"We come here often after church on Sunday afternoons. In fact it is one of those places I'm so used to being at that I typically forget to check in on Yelp (I know... gasp!!).  The food is consistently good and I've yet to be disappointed by one of their specials (which rarely repeat). Lately my favorite has been the baked potato skillet for its pure comfort food characteristics.   Service is quick and friendly. You pay at the front though, which took us a few trips to remember - sitting waiting for the check we had accidental \"family time\".  It may not rock your world, but you will enjoy the simple and well prepared food and leave satisfied. All that, and the price is excellent too!"}
{"text":"Predictable food, and the menu isn't too bad. Today I tried an omelette with bleu cheese, which ended up sounding better than it tasted. The flavor was too bland for the most part. We sat outside on the patio for a change, to take advantage of the nice weather. Maybe we were out of sift, out of mind because the service was considerably slower than usual."}
{"text":"Came here one day with my family. The service was quick and the food was pretty good. The pricing was very reasonable. The only issue was that my wife ordered a Reuben and they brought out a roast beef sandwich. The waitress took it back and corrected the problem. Otherwise there were no other problems. We would go back."}
{"text":"Great food and service . I have been coming for years and still nothing compared to the food and service, no matter which store I am at."}
{"text":"The pancakes are always delicious!  The maple syrup they bring out is crazy good, don't be shy to add more as you eat the pancake. Coffee is very nice tasting, bold but not bitter.  The flavored cream is a bonus but i prefer my coffee black. I had the quinoa power breakfast, I highly recommend it. My wife had the eye opener, two eggs, two bacon and sausage not to mention 2 pancakes. This is a solid favorite!"}
{"text":"We found this place a couple years ago and go back every time we're in town.  There are several healthy options on the menu.  Been 5-6 times tried different things and no complaints."}
{"text":"I'm torn on whether to give this place three or four stars...the food was definitely four star good, but the value was closer to three.  Also, the coffee, not so good...you know it is not one of their premier menu items when the couple next to you is greeted by the waitresses as regulars, order without looking at the menu, yet have brought their own coffee that they picked up at Einstein's on the way in...  Anywho, I had the breakfast sandwich, eggs, cheese and turkey sausage on a croissant.  It wasn't as big as I thought based on the description, but it was plenty filling, and probably kept me from gorged myself even more than I did.  On the side I got a fruit cup...what it is with places and fruit cups...there was plentiful pineapple and melon, and like two grapes.  Did I just get a bad scoop, did they have bad grapes that day, what is the deal?    Just thinking about the breakfast sandwich right now is getting me considering going back sooner rather than later (big ups to them for having a breakfast meat option that is not from a pig, btw)...so I'm giving them four stars."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the one star is for the service- we gave our name (seat for 2) to the host and waited 30 minutes. We finally went up to the host stand when people who came in after us were all getting seated. The hostess said she had crossed my name off because she \"couldn't read what the name said\". Seriously?? So instead of trying to spell it out she just pretended we weren't there? Unbelievable. We were seated immediately after that, but then 2 out of 4 things we ordered either weren't available or the machine was broken."}
{"text":"I like the Good Egg, very consistent food and now they have the calories on the menu.  This location is a little old now and could use a remodel but the service is always good."}
{"text":"Love this new location, came here on a Sunday morning and they told me 20 minutes but got us in 10 minutes later.  Service is always pretty good and the food is always great.  They closed the I-17 and Bell location to open this one since that strip mall was old and vacant.  This place is all brand new and I've always loved the food.  I love that they put all the calories on each item to make my decision better.  I wish all places did this."}
{"text":"Where to begin? I hope this critique fosters change for the better, and not excuses.  The ingredients were cheap. Even the potatoes were prepared ahead of time and not cooked fresh (the waitress described them as a \"vat\" of potatoes simply scooped onto the plate).   The French Toast was so dry and crunchy (yes, crunchy) we couldn't even soak up egg yolk with it.  The \"fresh\" fruit had a strange taste to it, and the honeydew was squishy.   The Hollandaise sauce clearly was not from scratch, but a jar.    The hash browns were swimming in grease of some kind (fake butter? I can't be sure, but whatever it was, it was a bath).  This was such a shame. The outside eating area is lovely, a perfect setting for an enjoyable breakfast. However, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very busy place.  Fast service.  Pancakes were not done in the middle.  Bacon was under cooked.  Good coffee and service.  Basic breakfast restaurant.  Good menu. Won't be back.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and were referred here by a friend who lives close.  service was great and food was delicious.  would def come back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! I am in love with the veggie skillet! Country potatoes, broccoli, spinach, cheese and egg any way you like it on top! Lots of other breakfast selections to choose from. Great family dining experience. We all get exactly what we want, leaving full and happy!"}
{"text":"Their pancakes are so good! They're practically a dessert themselves! Sometimes the service can get backed up when they're really busy, but the staff is always very nice. The outdoor seating is really nice during the cooler months, and the booths are nice a long for big parties. All around great breakfast place :)"}
{"text":"The Good Egg chain of restaurants is notably a great place for a friendly and tasty breakfast.  Unfortunately this location continues to have challenges with quality, customer service and overall experience.  I have been to this location at least 5 times in the last 2 months and each time there is something wrong with the experience.   From bad service, to burned potatoes, to burned omelettes, to missing items in the togo order, this location could use a refresher on the corporate mission.    I would rate this very poor as feedback has been given and still not good.   Time for new management and employees at this location."}
{"text":"I'm ecstatic that they've finally opened a Good Egg in this part of town, especially since it's in such a nice location. I've been going for years to this chain, started out in Tucson and have been to two other locations in Phoenix, so I have a long association with their typically excellent breakfast offerings.   That said, I was excited to check out their latest offering on this side of town. It's tucked away in a far corner of a shopping center, so there isn't much cross traffic or parking lot activity (everything else is further to the West, and thankfully people are too lazy to park this far away and walk down).   Walking in, the place looks both similar to the typical Good Egg but different at the same time. There's the bar, the outside patio, ample waiting room while you're getting a table, and the usual decoration, but it has more booths and a slightly more modern look than the other Phoenix locations. I'm sure part and parcel of that is the location, but I think the owners also might have tried to modernize it just a touch. For me, it works and I actually liked it. It felt less like a hang out for retirees or the local bridge club and more welcoming to a younger crowd. There's still the Sun City-ish, old-folks home type decor, but I feel like there's less of it here, which is a positive thing if you're trying to attract a broader clientele.   As for the service experience and the food, I must give some leeway here as we did arrive with a party of four around prime time for breakfast (8am) and the place was filling up quick. We didn't have to wait but 30 seconds to grab a table, which was nice, but you could tell the service was at its limit by the wait it took for someone to stop by and greet us, get drink orders and explain the specials. Once we ordered, we didn't see the poor girl again until our food came out, but thankfully nobody needed any refills, so we were good to go.   I'm a huge fan of the biscuits and gravy as well as the French toast, both of which came out just fine and were spot on. I did find the scrambled eggs to be lukewarm and a bit overcooked, but again I give some leeway here since they were jammed up pretty bad at that point.   I will say one thing, and that's that this place tends to attract people with young children. We had a screamer behind us, one to our left and one further down to the right, with more coming in as the morning went on. It really is difficult to enjoy a good hearty breakfast with some miserable little puke wailing his guts out, but unfortunately there's nothing the restaurant staff can do about that. Still, if you're averse to screaming infants and toddlers, might want to avoid this place during prime time, as they were there in droves. I think this has a lot to do with the median age group of the area where they opened this location. Out at Union and 83rd, you get mostly retirees, but out here on Happy Valley, it's more the thirty-something range, hence the multitude of young parents and their annoying infants.   But hey, if you can go on an off day and avoid the weekend blitz, or maybe go a bit later (or earlier!) than prime time, you might not have these issues. I'm certainly going to go back and make this a regular haunt, but I doubt I'll go back during the morning rush. Great place, great food, glad they opened one up on this side of town."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times. The turkey bialy is one of my favorites.  Most of the time the service is excellent.  Today we had a few issues with the preparation of the food, but when brought to the attention of the manager, he took the appropriate steps to make everything great.   This is a good, solid restaurant where you know that the quality of the food will be good."}
{"text":"So some of the things I love about coming here is the $1 eggstra add ons from side if whole wheat pancakes or black beans with pico de gallo....  and the free sweet treat check in offer from yelp!!! They even give you frequent diner cards and after 7 meals or after 5 kids meals... You get 1 free!!! By Mondays are double stamps."}
{"text":"The Good Egg just opened at the Safeway anchored shopping center at Happy Valley Road & 39th Avenue (Stetson Village Shopping Center).  The service was fast and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Blech. The Good Egg my dupa! It's more like \"The Bad Egg\"! As someone who loves trying new places for breakfast food, the one and only time I have ever eaten here, I got sick. In fact, both the BF and I didn't feel good the rest of the day after eating omelettes from this crap-hole.  Every time I drive by this place (which is every single day because I live in the neighborhood) I say out loud, \"Blech. More like the Bad Egg!\"   I don't know about other locations in the valley...but stay away from the one on 29th/Bell!"}
{"text":"My first time here was great. I had the Old Pueblo which is potatoes, green chilies, chorizo, eggs, flour tortillas, cheese, and tortillas. It was super good and very filling."}
{"text":"Great French toast, the kids Minnie Mouse pancake w/ bananas was great.   Good service. Sat us quickly even w a long line.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have breakfast here at least twice a month and sometimes more often. The food is always wonderful and you could not ask for better service! The bacon is thick and crisp. The eggs are light and fluffy and their sausage is so good! Oh yes, and the coffee is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great location and food quality. I have always been a fan of The Good Egg and their service has always been great no matter what location you are at. This is one of our regular locations.  By the way, the omelette's are very tasty."}
{"text":"Meh. I've had better breakfast and service. We weren't offered any coffee when we were seated (even though there were coffee mugs on the table), but when we asked for a pot and got our bill, it was an extra $2.75! I only wanted a cup of coffee with my breakfast but they charged for the full pot. I wish our waitress would have told us that the coffee was extra.  Besides that, the Presley pancakes were pretty good. The scrambled eggs were disappointing. I was also disappointed upon leaving that they have a fall menu (pumpkin pancakes) that I most definitely would have ordered had I known about it."}
{"text":"This place is your standard breakfast joint with a few healthy options.   Food-wise: it's ok. The crab omelette used imitation crab meat, the hollondaise sauce was on the side (good thing), and the dollar pancakes was a good deal on the side.   Now onto my experience there: The place has a variety of folks with a good amount of seniors there.  When we walked in, we weren't greeted with a warm hello, just a \"I'll be with you,\" as the hostess/cashier was ringing someone up.  After that transaction, she didn't bother to seat us but got distracted doing something else.   Our waiter was no different.  Didn't bother to ask us once if we needed anything else.  We had to ask for coffee and water refill.  I don't like to bring it up, but I definitely saw a difference in how we were treated versus other patrons.  Maybe we didn't look like we were from the neighborhood?  I don't know, but it was obvious based on my own observations that we were treated differently.  It actually left a sour taste in my mouth.   Will I come back?  Not if I don't have to.  There are other places that serve breakfast, and imitation crab is not something I'm craving to get any time ever!"}
{"text":"This place is so great for breakfast, it's probably the best breakfast in AZ.  It's reasonably priced, they have healthy choices, good service, and they even southwest style food that makes it more of an Arizona staple.  I've been to this location and others and they are really all good.  I worry this one could go out of business due to the location but I hope not.  Great breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this place.  One of the best breakfast places around Arizona, and this location is great.  This specific location is in a basically brand new buildnig and has two outside patios, one which is huge with heat lamps.  The inside area gets pretty full fast on a Saturday morning, so be prepared for a short wait.  The service here was very good.  Our waiter checked back on us several times.  The food was great.  What I love is the variety on the menu- they have omlettes, egg scrambles, pancakes, cinamon rolls, smoothies, salads, sandwiches and tons of things, including a large selection of healthy options.  They also list the nutrition information on the menu, which I kind of wondered about.  My girlfriend has four slices of bacon- listed at 160 calories.  That doesn't seem right to me.  Maybe it's 160 per slice?  LOL, not sure but it made me wonder.  Overall a great place for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  I believe they are closed for dinner."}
{"text":"One of the better, if not dependable breakfast places on the west side. Granted our selection isn't as diverse as some other parts of the city, but we take what we can get.   The Good Egg is a notch above places like Denny's and Sherri's (wait do they have those here in AZ?.) The portions are large and satisfying, the coffee is hot and plentiful and the menu items all have creative names involving the word egg. Like the Eggcellent Omelet.. you get the picture. but nothing on the menu is going to surprise you... unless you order the Oreo pancakes.. which I haven't been brave enough to do.  The decor is strictly country kitchen which isn't really my thing, but the church going crowd seems to love it as this place gets insanely packed around 9-10am on Sundays. However the staff handles it well and I've yet to have anyone who wasn't friendly and courteous.  If you want something quicker, Einstein's Bagels is only about a mile away and  there's a Marie Calendars around here somewhere as well. However for a real treat, (and a drive) check out the Orange Table near Indian School and Scottsdale road."}
{"text":"By looking at the other reviews it looks as though it maybe was not their best day.. Will start off by saying the staff is always friendly and welcoming .. We arrived around 11:30 because I was looking for breakfast and my father wanted lunch.  My family has eaten here several times last year and I remembered they had delicious chicken salad and egg salad ..the restaurant was empty except for 3 other tables which immediately I thought was odd.. My father ordered the butternut squash soup and Cobb salad.. The soup was served luke warm and not a cream base, very watery.. Then the waitress comes back and said their are no boiled eggs for the Cobb salad.. Again, it is an egg restaurant , how can you be out of boiled eggs.. My father then request a half of either chicken salad or egg salad, the waitress responds with an apology that they no longer serve either ... Strange again.. 10 minutes later this sad looking salad comes , the turkey is sliced deli meat... Not even fresh chicken or turkey.. My breakfast special of pumpkin pancake , Apple chicken sausage and scramble egg arrives .. All VERY AVERAGE... Thin pancake with a pumpkin spice , I do not think any purée was in it.. The fresh sausage was the size of a sample from Sam's.. We I went to pay the bill, the man at the register asked me how was everything ... My response was \"just ok\".... He did not even respond to ask why .. We left around 12:30,, the restaurant was empty and the waitress's were sitting in a booth wrapping silverware .. I felt bad for them because I am sure they rely on tips.. Bottom line, although this restaurant is close to our home , I  would drive 20 mins away for US Egg on Bell, always a hit and worth the wait.. Sorry Good Egg but I think with some small tweaking you can return where you use to be"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and unfortunately there aren't a lot of options in town. Everytime my husband and I go there the service is bad and  the food is majority of the time cold because its been sitting for awhile.  I went in this morning and it will for sure be my last time at any good egg. I sat at the bar for 20 minutes. Four waiters passed by me and  smiled, not a \"someone will be with you\" nothing. I was about to walk up to who appeared to be a manager (who also passed me a few times) , but I decided to leave because there was already a precedence to having a bad experience. It wasn't till I got up and left when a waiter asked if I was ok. I snapped because I was starving and pregnant and I feel bad, but that place deserves no business of mine. I'm done!!!!"}
