{"text":"Excellent Vegetarian food. We ordered Chole; Aloo ki subzi; Palak paneer with Puris and Bhaturas. The food was very homely. Place is more like a hole in the wall. We have not had such good food even in Brampton and Mississauga. 
The Dilbahar is mouth-watering.
Cheap and excellent; definitely coming back whenever in Montreal."}
{"text":"Vegetarian lovers!
Busy on a Monday!
Food was good and filling (veg samosa, thali \"daily special\", fried bread, mango juice and mango lassi)
Took an assorted box of pastries home! :)
Very cheap 25$ for 2
Service friendly and waiter was helpful
Kids friendly (made a special plate non-spicy)"}
{"text":"The best Indian in Montreal. Tamarind sauce so beautiful it has moved me to tears on occasion. At first you may simply think, oh boy, this is good, cheap food. This is your honeymoon phase, before you discover the depths of your love. Disregard the reviews of patrons accustomed to a corporate, customer-centric experience, forever conditioned to an entitled sensibility. Pushap offers everything your palette and imagination could possibly crave and beyond, without the nut-cupping western societies are bred to believe they should expect from those whom feed them. Wake up to what you have been missing. Thank the management, thank the staff; show your humble appreciation for their patronage. They have given you a most divine gift, you owe them - not the other way around."}
{"text":"Pushap is a very good place to go if you want to enjoy authentic Punjabi vegetarian cuisine. I have tried Channa Pathoora, Samosas, Pakoras and almost every type of sweet they make and every one of these items was insanely delicious. If you are a first timer you can order a thali which comes with two dishes of your choice, chapati and rice. Although it should be enough but I was so hungry (or greedy) that I ordered a Channa Pathoora as backup as well. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying authentic Indian food and I must say I got pleasantly surprised! I usually find it difficult to get vegetarian food that's good enough to satisfy me, but this little place makes me want to never stop eating. I liked it so much I took the metro and bus for an hour and a half the next day to bring back some for my mother and I. It's been three days now and I still can't wrap my head around how cheap everything is! What usually costs one person is plenty enough for two. 
This place is really a must, trust me!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews below they say it all.  This place is very authentic and the food was great!  Not to mention the prices were great.  

Can't go wrong here. Just give it a try."}
{"text":"Spending a lot of my life in New Delhi, iam no stranger to punjabi cuisine which is one of my favorite north Indian cuisines. One of my favorite thing about this cuisine is its prevalance.. you would find little mom and pop stores selling freshly  made breads and piping hot sabzi for dirt cheap prices, scattered like crazy.

Also, having spent considerable time in various parts of USA including New Jersey and New York I have come to expect specifics from any given Indian restaurant in USA or Canada. But I was pleasantly surprised in this case.

I walked in to Pushap just because it was close to where i stayed in Montreal. The appearances are unassuming and the staff were really really busy.

The food was striking in its simplicity and authenticity. It brought back memories of all the good times I had enjoying authentic punjabi food from road side dhabas of India. The flavors were just right with no excessive masalas thrown in and the breads were freshly baked/ fried.


I ended up paying 15 bucks for a truck load of food 2 of us ate."}
{"text":"Tasty, inexpensive, kinda greasy - that's pretty much what comes to mind whenever I drop by this gem of an Indian restaurant / bakery.

The entire menu is vegetarian, but even meat-eaters should find something on the wide ranging menu to distract them from their flaws.

Go for the Thali if you have the chance and you're hungry - it's around $5 for a plate of food including rice, coleslaw, Indian bread, and 3 curries. Can't go wrong for that price.

The only downside is that some of their dishes are pretty heavy on the cooking oil. Even the veggie curries come across as a little greasy. Stay away from the fried bread if your stomach is used to eating light meals!"}
{"text":"We came here based on the high rating and volume of reviews.  After the experience, I now understand that people are probably more excited about the low price tag; rather than a truly authentic and delicious food experience.

First off, the service here was just terrible.  We were seated and it took about 10 minutes for anyone to notice we were even there.  Which is usually fine if you're having nice conversation with your date, but in this situation we were hungry and we needed our Shahi paneer fix, and we needed it NOW.  Once we got our water, it took another 5 minutes for the person to come back and take our order.  I remember longingly staring off into the distance, awaiting the return of our server, eyeing the other clients and noting the status of their orders.  And then, I sadly noted others (larger groups) who came in after us get their food first.

Ok, what is the big deal you ask? Fine. Maybe the food is so great that it's worth the bad service.  I've been to some hole in the wall dive bar restaurants with food so good it knocked my socks off.  

But it wasn't.  Now, before I get all critical about the food, I thought I should mention that hubby and I are seasoned Indian food consumers.  Him being of Indian decent and also regularly frequenting top rated Indian restaurants in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.

After all the anticipation, the food finally arrived. All I recall are mine and hubby's eyes slowly meeting over the Shahi paneer dish with the same odd expression and look of confusion on our faces.  We were both thinking the same thing:  Why does the paneer dish look like scrambled mucous? Where did the traditional paneer cubes in creamy sauce go?  What caused them to meet such a blended fate?  I hesitatingly poked around at the puddle, hoping hubby would be brave enough to try it first.  Luckily, my vegetarian thali was up next, so I would get to eat solid food instead of the paneer mush hubby was newly fated with.

The thali was forgettable, not unlike the unforgettable mush Paneer.  

Low price tag or not, it didn't satisfy our Indian food fix and we likely won't return."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, and have many fond memories in this place. I still love to come back here whenever I have a craving for a hearty indian vegetarian meal. The channa samosa and shahi paneer are two of my favorites, not to mention the luscious rasmalai dessert. We love Mohan because he's always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great food for affordable price.. Love there aloo tikki, palak paneer and dal."}
{"text":"When ordering their Combinations or Thali, I found there was not enough rice, but otherwise the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious and savoury vegetarian indian food I've ever tried.

While the decor of the place is a little dated, with chairs that squeak and a weird layout where people always seem to be walking by, the food is amazing.

I strongly suggest coming here on a Wednesday or a Saturday -- these are the days that they serve the eggplant and onion + the turmeric curried potatoes, the two best dishes in the entire place. The best dessert choice is the little hotdog like donut."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices sums it up.

The daily Thali would be your best bet as a new comer as it's almost always good and is a way of tasting a few of their offerings. There are variations of it that you can choose. The Thali consists of two veggie sides, rice and their tasty version of coleslaw and regular or fried Nan. The spice is just right.

Their Sambosas are amazing.

I tried several of their dishes aside from the Thali on several visits and i have to say I was never disappointed once. For drinks, they have a good Mango Lassi but I prefer the Salted one.

The have various deserts which are displayed in the fridge at the entrance.

I think the place is cute and cozy with nice music playing in the background. The service was never rude on several visits but just a bit hurried given the busy nature of the place.

Just a tip, whenever you order any take-out, make sure the associated condiments are included as they tend to forget them. Be sure to always ask for their Achaar (indian pickles) as well as the Sauce that comes with the Sambosas.

One of the few places I recommend to any visitors to Montreal."}
{"text":"Prices here can't be beat! Come hungry because while any individual item is a reasonable portion, everything is so good you won't want to leave any on your plate for silly reasons like being too full! 

Recommend paying the extra buck to choose your own combo. While I have yet to be disappointed by anything here, there's nothing like scratching the itch that only *insert your favourite dish here* can do. 

And ... If possible, save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Malgré que la décoration laisse grandement à désirer, qu'un petit ménage dans les salles de bain ne ferait pas de tort, que le service ne soit pas toujours des meilleurs (plutôt lent si le restaurant est bondé et les serveurs ne sont pas des plus sympathiques), la nourriture est tellement délicieuse et si économique que je n'ai pas d'autre choix que de pardonner les imperfections de ce restaurant et de lui accorder 5 étoiles."}
{"text":"Very good indian food, although its oily. The flavours are delicious otherwise, although the actual resturant is nothing fancy. Take out is always an option!
I recommend the spicy tomato cheese curry, the cauliflower potato curry, and the samosas!"}
{"text":"like an average food, let say its good for 6$ amount kind of food. I'm not really kind a fun of stainless plate. when my spoon touch on the plate its give me a felling of greeeeeeh. friendly people, just when I ask for dessert, he used his bare hand, same hand he used to give me a change."}
{"text":"Excellent northern meals.there is no meat dishes however,which may be a setback for chicken or beef lovers.Absolutely affordable"}
{"text":"Fantastic value. Great meal. Couldn't get better. I wish I was local, I would never cook and use this place as a substitute to my kitchen."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian sweets, I got a mixed box and tried almost all of them...loved them all...Didn't try the food so I can't comment on that but would go again just for the yummy sweets"}
{"text":"On se sent chez Pushap comme en Inde. La nourriture végétarienne ne laissera pas vos papilles endormies bien longtemps. Vaste sélection de desserts, tout goûte extrêmement bon!"}
{"text":"Very good veggie restaurant.  They don't write down orders so you have to repeat sometimes - especially if you go with a big group."}
{"text":"Very small location and the place was packed from beginning to end. They had a wide variety of vegetarian plates to pick from and the prices were very affordable. I did not expect to walk out with a full stomach for what I had ordered.

The only negative aspect was the service, although the waiter was very nice and polite, it took 15 minutes to get a menu and another 30 before he took my order.  It probably didn't help that he was the only working waiter to serve a house full of clients.

4.5/5 Would go back"}
{"text":"Simple place, good food, good service, very good prices. A solid combination for a must visit restaurant. A bit far from downtown area but a must visit for sure.

Tried the thali with chole bhature, it was delicious just like the aloo and kadi. Finished with jalebis, every bit delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! So cheap its unbelievable. $10 will get you a 3 course meal (that you wont be able to finish). One of my favourite spots in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cute little family owned restaurant thats been around for a while. Extremely tasty, low price Indian food. You get the daily special for about 5 bucks which comes with naan. Grab a samosa too for sure. The food sometimes tastes a little greasy which I'm not always down with but its still great food."}
{"text":"Pushap n'a l'air de rien de l'extérieur mais dès qu'on rentre, on a envie d'y rester. Le personnel est super sympathique, le comptoir de confiseries est alléchant.

Je vous recommande de prendre le spécial du midi : très bon et rapidement servi. Surtout, pas cher.

attention : pour ceux que ca pourrait décevoir, leur nourriture est strictement végétarienne. Donc pas de poulet au beurre !! Aussi, ils ne prennent que l'argent cash.

Bon appétit ! ( réservez pour groupes)"}
{"text":"Finally ate here. The sweets are bomb! The thali is great price. I didn't quite like the paneer it's not the way I'm used to it. But it is good here! The samosa hmmmm....."}
{"text":"Hells yeah Pushap! 

You walk in and the FIRST thing you see is a glass display at the back that's filled to the brim with a gazillion amazing tiny sweets of varying colours, some dry, some damp with syrupy goodness. 

A full, vegetarian-only menu with tons of very reasonably priced options to choose from. But then again, the taly's cheap and filling and amazing as it is and the food's spicy and greasy. And in all likelihood, you'll be full up by the time you leave so you might have to take some of those sweet deserts to go.

And though it's a bit far if you're a plateau-ite or some such, why not make an afternoon of it? Bring a backpack and stop by the Sally-Ann or some of the discount stores nearby? Find out when the Orange Julep is having a car show or bike up with a bunch of buds and go race on the hypodrome track and go urbanexplore the building."}
{"text":"They are so nice and the food is simply great and really low price!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to a potluck party, ran out of time to cook, and didn't know what to bring... luckily we were near Pushap. We ordered 5 dozen of one of the finest samosas in town. If you have a craving for vegetarian indian cuisine or need to satisfy a need for indian sweets and are on a budget, this is the place to go! I mean where else can you find a dozen of samosas for $4.80?"}
{"text":"If all vegetarian food were this good and inexpensive, I think I'd seriously consider converting. It's a family run restaurant that feels so authentic even though I've never been to India. They come over and present you with a menu but most people just get the tali of the day. The plate consists of two vegetable curries, rice and a choice between chick peas or lentils, and fried bread or not. The pakoras and samosas are a nice addition if you are hungry, but the Tali itself is usually enough for me. A proper milk chai and a sweet vegetarian dessert leaves you more than satisfied. All that for only 7-8$!?!? Incredible."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. authentic, delicious, 100% vegetarian (and very vegan-friendly) Indian food. relaxed ambiance, great staff. they always give me a little extra rice or one of those peanut-butter balls to go with my restants."}
{"text":"Probably the one of the best Indian restaurants around Montreal. The location is obscure, the ambiance is nothing to rave about, but I've never had a bad meal here, like never. The servers are very attentive as well. Even the chai tea is worth raving about, and so are the samosas and the cheap vegetarian specials, I usually just get whatever the daily special is and I leave happy."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this small unassuming Indian restaurant. It is a family run restaurant.  They work very hard and make Super tasty food with authentic flavor and fast service.  Always busy.  I love the case of sweets at the door.   
Bring cash.  If you have a US debit card the next door ATM does not accept them, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Good food,  extremely good value,  a little more spice than I can handle in dishes I wouldn't expect it from.

Slightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and it's no longer on the menu. 

I'd have given five stars,  but we ordered rice and it never came."}
{"text":"Hands down best Indian food in Montreal for vegetarians. No matter how far away I have ended up living from Pushap I keep coming back here. 

There's a menu but most people just stick with the taly of the day with either the chickpea or lentil talys.  Ordering off the menu generally takes a lot longer to get the food.  If you go with the taly of the day, for about $7 you can get a huge meal (two talys, rice, salad, nan, dessert, and a chana samosa).  Best deal in town. 

Located close to the metro so its easy to get to. 

Service is generally very good. If you don't finish your food, you might get scolded and probably won't get your dessert. The owners are very friendly though and loyal to their repeat customers (I usually get a few extra sweets in my bag or extra helpings of chana samosa). 

A true gem in this city!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I haven't really made the healthiest food choices since moving to Montreal, so I've been looking into more vegetarian/vegan places to balance out some of my meat intake. Luckily, one of the first places I found was Pushap! 

I've had veggie Indian food before, but Pushap truly specializes in it. The Thali for the day included a lentil/daal dish, a potato/carrot/chickpea dish, a tomato-based dish, along with rice and bread. Everything was full of flavor and spices, and made me forget entirely about the smoked meat poutine around the corner at BellePro. I also got a Mango Lassi, which was a perfect accompaniment. 

Not quite walking distance, but a block and some change from the Namur station, so I hopefully I can make Pushap a regular thing!"}
{"text":"Have you ever experienced a family feel for a restaurant- seen it flourish over the years. I have had the pleasure of dining here since I was a kid. The owners are probably the most humble of people -greeting their clients only with kindness .i would say that this restaurant is one of Montreal's finest gems to experience authentic local dining . 

You will find only vegetarian options here, but carnivores be warned- you will fall in love as I did. There samosas in fame can be compared to Montreal 's own st. viator  bagels. You can not miss out on their unique homemade chutney to compliment the samosas. 

I usually order the samosa chaat (yogurt,samosas, tamerind sauce ), mango lassi, shahi paneer, bhaturas (bread) , a sweet dessert (dilbahar- looks like a hot dog with cream filling), and a cup of chai - all this for less than. 20$ ! 

Totally recommend this place- for family , dates or study sessions!"}
{"text":"This place was utter garbage. We had palak paneer - too greasy, not good. Paneer makhani or tikka masala, not sure which because the sauce was basically white with red flecks, and not good. We had a chana masala (presumably) dish and it was mushy and didn't taste like any I've ever had before. Honestly, if this were the first Indian food I had ever had I would never ever return. And the cashier shortchanged me. So... Eat here at your own bloody peril. **in fairness, this is the only Indian food I have ever had in Quebec. If this is always what it tastes like then my apologies to the entire staff of Pushap except for the person who stiffed me and also as a general note to all québécois, the world of Indian food has so, so much more to offer you."}
{"text":"Very authentic Indian place. I would say it's the best Indian food I had for this price, maybe even for any price. The owner welcome us with her Indian accent English and served us very good food. We wanted to try some of their sweets after we finished dinner, she even gave some to us for free. Very worth going for!"}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't have gone had I known it was vegetarian.   Everything was remarkably average.  Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered what seemed like tons and tons of food for two and somehow it came out to less than $20. 

Thali: Amazing
Naan: Amazing
Samosas: Super Amazing

Sweets: don't know haven't tried 

Pakora: ok, but at $1,50 for 6 who can complain? 

Raita, lassi, and chai are all also very good. 

The restaurant is clean, decent, and the owner is very attentive. We normally dine in but tonight we tried takeout, he literally took the time to carefully tape our containers shut so there'd be no spillage.  Clean, ridic cheap, and good service. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Pushap is still good and cheap but I think they've raised their prices ... so, one less star for you. 

This place got five stars in the past simply because of the cheap cheap Yankee Doodle prices. You could have a feast for two and it would have run you around twenty dollars or so but now that same feast is about thirty. 

All I'm saying is that if they're raising the prices then they're gonna have to raise the quality and maybe cut back on the overly surly service. 

Again, everything is as good as it used to be ... just a smidgen of a tad bit more expensive. The chana batura (chickpeas simmered in aromatic spices served with fried flat bread, achaar (lemon and mango pickle) with whole green chillies and onion) is excellent. The bhel puri (a puffed rice street food type snack) is very good. The thali is a good tasting platter."}
{"text":"Wow, for this price it's incredible. All the dishes had their own spice blend and was cooked and season properly.

The service is quick and the restaurant looks clean.

Great variety in the menu and everything was serve piping hot, including the freshly seared naan bread that just melt in your mouth. 

I do point out it's serve piping hot because, the only drawback I can find, the dishes are serve on metal plates which doesn't hold the warmth like porcelain plates. 

The desserts are average. But if you only want a sweet bite to finish your meal. They are spot on."}
{"text":"Premier indien a montreal c'est juste top. Épicé à souhait ! Pour essayer j'ai donc pris à emporter. 
J'ai choisi le daily. Vous avez le choix entre pois chiches ou lentilles mon choix c'est tourné vers les lentilles et c'était juste délicieux. Deuxième choix qui s'offre à vous le naan frit ou normale. J'ai préféré rester light avec la version normale. 
Les desserts honnêtement je préfère vous laisser découvrir par vous !! Végétarien à 3000%. C'est sur j'y retournerais"}
{"text":"This is my second time mass-ordering samosas from Pushap, and it was great! 
We doubled our order this time, again for a fundraiser, and they sold out in no time. We'll probably go for 300 samosas next order!
The delivery was on time, and the samosas were hot and delicious. 
Hurray for Pushap!"}
{"text":"look like recently has been remodeled. Nice & clean. We tried for lunch , ordered thali ,comes 3 different stew with rice & Naan, meal of the day. The other dish vegetarian stew with rice & Naan. Excellent food. Enjoyed very much. Great service. Good size portion . Onion  bugi with tamarin very delicious ."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Tasty and Quick service. Prices are more than reasonable. I Would go back anytime."}
{"text":"What a great find! I saved my 200th review for a special place like this!
I came here following a glowing recommendation by fellow yelper Hannah B. (given while sharing Indian delicacies at another place).
The food was good (I mean, for this price, there is no competition!) and very authentic, though if you spend much more at a fancier place you will probably get something better. The crowed was mostly locals, many of them Indian (and others not!), families, young professionals, and well... the four of us!
I arrived first and secured a spot. It was almost entirely full on a Thursday evening, and during our two hour stay there was a constant line at the entrance (of people waiting for take out, not a table). 
Most of the people seem to get the thali ($6!) but we decided to get a few dishes to share instead. 
I'll pause to say that there was one waitress for the entire place, and service was very slow. It took about 15 minutes just to get water, and another 10 minutes to get menus (my friend got up for that - she was hungry!). The entire dinner was 2 hours.
We were told (in Hindi) to get an appetiser to give them more time to get to us, so we got Chana-Bhatura - which they split into two and served with four spoons. This yumi dish is basically smosa fried skin with channa masala served on top with some fresh onion chunks. 
We then ordered Chana, Alu-Ghobi, Malai-Kofta, and Paneer-Chilli with some chapati, bhatura and rice.  I liked the Alu-Ghobi very much, the breads were good and the rice was lightly fried with jeera (cumin seeds),  but the rest were not brilliant - I definetly had better Kofta, and the Chilli-Paneer was very oily (but tasty!). 
It is a bring-your-own-wine place (and there is a dep next door) but I never need booze with my Indian food. I do like lassi - and I tried the mango-lassi but it tasted diluted. When we wanted to order some more it was frowned upon (and I understand that with so little servers it's hard to get to a second / third order), but a nice man came and took our extra order anyway, and came back a third time for the dessert order. 
We shared a plate on sweets that is made right there: Four Gulab Jamuns (unfortunatly served cold without syrup), and excellent Barfy, Coconut-Barfy, and Milk-cake. The chai was properly spiced!
The most awesome part was the bill - for this entire big meal for four, we paid $41. Wow. 
They say you get what you pay for, and my critics aside - this was well worth the small price (and possibly even the shlep to Namur)."}
{"text":"Excellent Vegetarian food at the price of fast food. Try the amazing and ridiculously low priced tag take away samosas"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for with this place... I stopped coming here for years after too many things where bothering me whenever I would go, like how dirty this place is, the big wash room has some really disgusting ceiling tiles, almost always out of toilet paper, doors & walls would need an intense wash up.
The young thugs that try to pass as servers would need a course in hospitality.
The owners are always friendly.
The food is OK but after having ventured out to so many other indian restaurants, I would rather pay twice the price for everything and be in a cleaner environment and have less of a fast food feeling while I'm eating, after the young waiters practically throw the thalis on our table...
At least the Indian music is always loud enough and the price is so cheap you wonder if this place is stuck in time, twenty years ago.
The Pushap on Des Sources has had many cleanliness problems from the health inspector, I'm hoping this brother is cleaner...but by the looks of it all, I doubt it very much.
Just don't bring your new hot date here, wait at least a month before inviting them here...
I give them 3 stars, one more than before.
It's like McDonald's for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Simple.... it's cheap n tasty Indian veggie cuisine. 
Me personally I'm not into Indian food but my GF dragged me here kicking and screaming and I must say, I should have came quietly and hungrier.
The common plate here is Chama batura and tali. The naan bread is quite good although my girls piece was not as good as mine, so they might lack in consistency. 
Keep in mind that the food may be a bit oily but it is very filling (and honestly I've never eaten Indian food that wasn't oily) but what gave then 4 stars instead of 3 was VALUE! I could have gone to McDonald's a few blocks away and paid more for a less healthy dish. 
All in all its worth a shot , but be aware that there is road construction (and for some reason it looks like Noone is gonna fix that road any time soon) so plan on a little detour of walking"}
{"text":"The only thing I have eaten here are the samosas. They are really good. Make sure to try the sauce that comes with it. Yum"}
{"text":"Where shall I begin with this restaurant? 

If you love Indian food and don't like spending tons of money for good comfort food, then this is the place for you. It's a family run business. The menu offers different Indian food. I had the Chana thaali with poori and it was good! Their samosas are very well known for. They're freshly made. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant if you're a huge fan of Indian food and also your wallet isn't gonna cry over it as it is very affordable"}
{"text":"The Thalis are big in portion and good value-for-money. This is a vegetarian place with a selection of desserts. I personally don't find the food very tasty and I find it to be very oily. It's very cheap however and generously filling so it's a cheap eatery. The Mango Lassi and Samosa (I would get them as an appetizer rather than the other appetizers in the menu) are both actually very good. The sweets are a bit disappointing compared to original Indian standards however."}
{"text":"Very busy, noise level can be loud, making it very difficult for the LONE server to hear what you've ordered;consequently, she'll just bring you what the rest of the group just ordered. We were a group of 12, so we ALL wound up with the same order, despite the fact that those sitting at the end of the table, CLEARLY stated we wanted naan, and NOT the fried bread. The thali was very good, albeit somewhat greasy (eggplant especially). The chai was OK, not exceptional, the plain, spiced tea not.  Service was SLOW, but then again, see above, but I suppose this is part of the reason why the prices are soo cheap & the crowd just keeps on coming. Overall, some of the best cheap Indian food I've had in the city, definitely worth the trip. Meat eaters, good luck; this place is strictly vegetarian"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since the day it opened in the 80s. The two brothers who opened up the are super nice and always treated me well and I feel forever grateful to them for introducing me to the samosa! To this day the samosas here are the best I've ever had, not to mention the cheapest! They also make the best deserts as well. Now that I left Montreal I always hit this place up when I visit."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in Montreal. Their plates are just delicious, and they also have a good variety of Indian desserts which are yummy as well. Nice environment. Service always excellent. And prices cannot be beaten. Recommended 100%."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pushap regularly for over five years now. Whether you want to eat in or take-out, their flavours and value are unbeatable! I would recommend getting the thali, and their pakoras and bajis are delicious too, especially if you can get them fresh. I've never been disappointed by any of their desserts, either."}
{"text":"Great place. Quite affordable prices for very good food. A must for vegetarians."}
{"text":"This is a staple in my neighbourhood, I remember knowing this place was great when you saw local members of the south asian community attending it.The thali is reasonably priced at only 7$.The chick peas are my favourite with the fried naan.My family buys the samosas with the sweet tamarind sauce for every event"}
{"text":"After eating here, I only wish that Pushap were closer to my place rather than being 40-50 minutes away by metro because they serve up some bomb vegetarian food. Since I had nearly five hours to kill in between classes, I decided to take a spontaneous metro trip here because honestly I'd be more useful writing about food than trying to find a napping place in Burnside building.

I got here just as it opened, so the lunch rush didn't hinder my chances of getting back to class on time. Deciding that it would be basically sacrilege not to order the renowned thali the first time I came here according to other reviewers, I ordered that and chose chickpeas over lentils for one section of it (gotta contain the poops) and the paratha for my bread, which was fried. I also got a mango lassi, and I think the total bill including tax ended up being less than $10, which was a huge steal considering how much food they gave you.

The mango lassi was fresh, cold, and had a nice, natural mango flavor that wasn't overly sweet. The waiter later brought out the papadum, and while it's just a matter of personal preference that I don't really like it that much in general, the yogurt sauce that came along with it was really nice and counteracted the spices very well.

When the waiter presented me with the thali, I thought that I would be able to finish it rather easily, but I was so wrong. Everything was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it was also so filling that I almost had to request takeout. The onion dish was savory and sweet at the same time, and I think the tomato (?) in it brought an acidity to it that created another dimension of flavor entirely. The chickpea dish was amazing (probably due to my love of chickpeas in general), and it proved a great substitute for meat as the texture of the dish and how it was cooked were super filling. Finally, the cheese dish was super tasty and I would eat so much more of it if I could. All of the dishes were paired well with both the paratha, which was chewy, crispy, and hot goodness all rolled up into one, and the rice. I would without a doubt have tried their sweets if I had the stomach and energy left for it, but I was so stuffed that I had to wait a few minutes before I could pay the bill. *insert sweat drop here*

Sidenote: This is a perfect place to go to if you're a carnivore and have a grudge against vegetarians or the Meatless Mondays movement in general. It will change your mind about vegetarian food at a cheap price and is very satisfying, so I would encourage anyone to come here if they are extremely hungry and willing to try something different but delicious at the same time! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This is the best *North* Indian food in Montréal.
- The white girl who reviewed Thanjai

I jumped the gun when I categorically declared Thanjai the best Indian food in Montréal while ignoring the sheer size and diversity of the Indian subcontinent. Because if you want a hot and perfectly crispy puri (flat bread) or some hearty chana masala (chickpeas in a mildly spicy sauce) and a side of achaar (OMG THE MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER okay it's pickled lemon), you're gonna need to go north ... in fact, one metro station north, to Namur, where Pushap is within walking distance.

Apparently the thali is pretty popular here (if you get it, spend the extra 75¢ for raita and papram), but for me, it's all about the comforting, soulful, fill-your-belly chana bhatura. For under $5 (tax included!) you can eat a good portion of their chana, one of their specialties, served with a couple of hot, crispy bhatura (like puri but different), some fresh onion slices and a couple green chilies, and a serving of achaar. ACHAAR! This is the kind of thing I find myself wiping the residue of off the dish with my fingers if there isn't any bread left.

\"Why does this person's race matter?\" you may have asked upon reading my opening paragraph. Well, as a white person of northern European heritage, I was raised on a diet of baked potatoes and Tuna Helper, and the strongest spice I ever tasted was a light sprinkling of black pepper. I'm happy to say that I've come a long way in the past few years, but I still prefer my food pretty low on the Scoville scale. There are nevertheless some exceptions to this, of which ACHAAR (or Indian pickle) is a significant one. The principal ingredients of achaar are magic and deliciousness that punch you in the face with flavour, although I'm pretty sure lemon and spices figure in there too. While in Thailand this summer, I discovered the delicious sour-and-spicy tom yum soup, and realized that sour spiciness is a whole 'nother ball game from regular spiciness, a ball game I was a lot more interested in playing. I find the sourness really cuts the spiciness, but my partner finds that sour intensifies spice, so disclaimer: I have no idea what will happen when the sour-spice hits your individual taste buds. My advice to have some raita (savoury yogurt) handy to control any damage stands. Like a lot of Indian food, the chana will start off pretty mild but halfway through you might notice a taste bud smolder that will grow into a fire if you keep feeding it.

Getting back to Pushap, you can get a pretty good plate of comfort food for under $5, but if you've hauled your ladoos all the way out to metro Namur, why not go all the way? For $30, Raj and I can eat ourselves into a food coma with appetizers, drinks and sweets to go with our chana bhatura and/or thali. Don't miss the lassi if you're getting drinks. The only way to go wrong with the sweets is not getting at least one. Appetizer-wise, the chaat papadi is amazing and the samosas are pretty good too. I wish I could recommend the cheese pakora but I can't because I've never tried it because they always seem to be out! If you've had it, please let me know so that I know it isn't just a mystical legend of fried balls of cheese.

Ambience-wise, I'd totally recommend Pushap for a date. It's festooned in multicoloured string lights that make it look like it's always Diwali or Christmas, but between the Bollywood tunes playing on the sound system and the traditional Indian paintings of couples tastefully giving each other bedroom eyes, this place says ROMANCE. Just be careful not to eat so much that you need to waddle out at the end of the date ... some advice I could probably stand to take myself."}
{"text":"Excellent resto indien !
Une amie me l'a conseillé et je n'ai absolument pas été déçue. Les plats y sont succulents et frais... Nous avons pris leur curry de pois chiche, fondant et savoureux, l'excellent pain chiapati, le binhi, les samosas, et une entrée de riz croquant... Le tout était, exquis. Seul bémol, le décor est... Inexistant, ou du moins d'une autre époque et hétéroclite. Le service est ok, sans plus, mais avec le sourire ! A ne pas manquer."}
{"text":"Confession: je ne suis pas entrée. J'ai attendu que la nourriture vienne à moi. Je me suis EMPIFFRÉE de samosas. Ça ne coûte pratiquement rien, c'est un baume sur notre coeur blessé par la présente conjoncture économique. Et ça goûte le paradis. 

Juste pour ça, le jeune, vas-y. Pour vrai."}
{"text":"Very nice vegetarian indian food. it's close to my job so I go there often and each time it's the same taste and quality. lunch specials are super cheat only $6.50, I must warn the people with sensitive stomachs that the foods can be quite oily and therefore feel heavy, so watch for that ;) Enjoy"}
{"text":"I visited this resto twice in one week! Usually I would order for pickup but I decided to dine in. A small family scale restaurant by namur. Food is incredible and the price is so reasonable! Staff is very friendly. Both times I ordered a veggie thali with a bhatura. I chose 2 veggie dishes of my choice. Really enjoyed the eggplant dish and shahi paneer. You also get a gulab jamun as dessert. It was so so good when warm. We ordered a nice cup of chai which was perfect with the syrupy dessert. 

I had the lentil soup which was tasty but it lacked some salt. I also had the potato paratha. I wasn't impressed because they used the same samosa potatoes so the potatoes weren't cooked through. I also found it on the smaller side. I did enjoy it and would probably order again in the future. 

I would definitely go back. The only reason it loses a star is because it's quite crammed up and it was difficult to walk around when it was full."}
{"text":"Nourriture: c'etait bon, mais sans plus. La qualite est la, mais ca manque de raffinement. Le choix des plats est interessants, mais ils n'ont pas tous sur le menu.

Prix: la raison des 3 etoiles , pas cher du tout. Par contre, on m'a chargé plus qu'il fait. Pas de facture, il m'a dit 27$. En sortant j'ai fait le calcul et ca donnait moins que ca! 

Service: moins 3 etoiles. Lent, voir tres tres lent, pas souriant, on a du courrir apres le serveur. Des qu'il y a beaucoup de monde, le service est nul. En plus, si tu commandes autres chose que le Thali, c'est encore plus long. On est reste 2h, si c'est pas plus.

Pour le prix, ca peut valoir la peine, mais ca depend de vos priorites."}
{"text":"What a great and local find!!

You could easily eat here for $4 tops! Not only that but it's actually good, even really good!

I gave my handyman some samosas and he loveddd them! Normally that wouldn't mean much but he also happened to be one of the chefs at Crudessence!

The Thali is beyond great and the service is pretty fast. 

Overall, I'm really happy that Yelp pointed me in the direction of Pushap!"}
{"text":"Pushap is a real hole in the wall kinda place. There is no store sign or banner outside, if you can't find them call them. This is a gem and a must try. 
Food is authentic and best I have had in years. And all indian looking for indian spicy food, this is the place. 
Everything is served fresh and flavors are just the right proportion. I wish I could drive to Montreal every weekend to have their food. 
Sweets are so fresh and delicious, that we bought a months supply before leaving."}
{"text":"Wooooaaaa!! Sérieux! Je suis pas végétarienne, mais j'ai franchement eu un gros coup de coeur pour Pushap. Ma copine qui travaille chez David's tea m'a invité à aller la rejoindre pour dîner et comme elle est Vegan, le choix dans ce coin là est assez restreint. J'ai décidé de lui laisser commander pour moi, comme elle est une habituée, elle connait les trucs et les meilleurs choix. J'ai eu droit à mon propre Thali et c'était très suffisant. J'étais comblée! Bonus, c'est réellement pas cher. 21$ pour nos deux repas.

C'est clair que j'y retourne, très bientôt!"}
{"text":"Pro:

- Delicious, tasty food. I love everything I've ever ordered here, even though I have no memories for indian names.

- Fresh, crunchy-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside samosa dough that just screams \"Fresh!\" and \"Manually Made!\", with tasty spicy potato filling.

- Big big portion, made even more impressive by the small price. (Large-size man-portion thali for 6-7 dollars). 

- Cheap dessert, large selection.

- Fun decors.

Con:

- Always busy and a bit short-staffed. Abrupt and minimal service.

- Vegetarian only.

- Since it's so popular, and the restaurant only seats 7-9 groups. You might have to wait in line on a weekend.

Summary:

The best Indian restaurant in Montreal for me any day of the week, except on the day that I'm craving meat."}
{"text":"The BEST samosas I've ever had. And their sweet treats are out of this world!!!!!!! Don't get fooled by negative reviews. Some people just don't have a taste for good food!!!"}
{"text":"Typical indian in an aluminium tray!
Is it spectacular, no. Is it tasty, oh yes!
We were told we had to take the Tali (might be miswritten) it's the regular plate with everything. Curry potatoes, a choice of lentils or chick peas, some sort of vegetable delicious mush (I don't have any clue what it was), cabbage, rice and of course naan bread, regular or fried. I recommend the fried one as it tasted and looked like a plain and unsweetened beaver tail. 
It was friendly enough and I would definitely go back to try their big array of samosas. 

2 plates for 15$ can't really beat that"}
{"text":"Un rapport qualité-prix comme on les voit rarement. Pushap offre une variété de plats indiens végétariens regorgeant de saveur. Tout est fait maison, tout est authentique et tout est bon!

À chaque jour, le restaurant est rempli de gens qui commandent le fameux Thali du jour. Le service est toujours très rapide qu'on se fasse servir au comptoir ou à table. Habituellement, je commande plusieurs plats pour emporter: samosas, caris de lentilles ou pois chiches, palak paneer, pain naan, riz et autre. Sans blagues, ma facture n'est jamais plus de 25$ et j'ai assez de bouffe pour 3 repas.

Oh, et en terminant... n'oubliez pas votre argent comptant!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet!!! I have been going regularly as a default home-sickness fix. The food is reminds me so much of home! Simple menu, very reasonable prices. 
Cash/debit only. The ambiance is little messy but I can overlook that since I usually get my food taken away.. Have even ordered for parties and didn't even need to inform like days beforehand.. Just a couple of hours in advance since the food is all freshly made to order. Had a few mishaps with cracked containers and spilling due to that but not a huge inconvenience. 
I really love this place and it is quite popular within my Indian as well as non-Indian friend circle! :) 
Vegetarian restaurant (few dishes may even qualify as vegan) as well as some without onion/garlic which some folks prefer. 
I will keep on coming here every time I am in the area shopping at one of the entrepôts :P"}
{"text":"Still an amazing place to come for Vegetarian Indian Food.  Their Thalli is flavourful, spicy and fragrant in Indian spices!  

I came here and the guy working the counter didn't even ask me for a menu he just said do you want chick peas or lentils and fried or regular naan.  I did chick peas and fried naan.  It's one of my favourite lunches in Montreal!  They serve it with water. Didn't even ask if I wanted something else to drink!  Very simple yet the meal is delicious!  

As always I took home some samosas, gulab jamun (coconut and regular) and they had some vegetable pakora this time so I went with half a pound!  Sure it's a fried un-healthy takeout but everything is devishly damn good!  

Parking is quite difficult around the restaurant as it's only street parking in a busy neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Combo A for 4 people. Safe to say I got my moneys worth. Mango lassy was a perfect compliment. Lentil soup was cheap (1.50) and delicious."}
{"text":"The BEST and the cheapest samosas in Montreal! Hmmm delicious ! And it can be cool when you go to a party a bring those ones!
In you have a big appetite it's the best place to have a meal : cheap, quick and delicious ;)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner, and we both got the thali plate. Not the best Indian food I've had, but for the price, it's still very delicious! They also have a large selection of sweets you could try after your meal. The sweets can be a bit oily and overly sweet though."}
{"text":"Restaurant sans viande. 
Un de mes restos indiens favoris à Montréal. 
Commandez le spécial du jour avec les samosas en entrée. 
Très peu cher et savoureux.
Aucunement chic comme resto mais pour le reste, il en vaut le détour!"}
{"text":"One of my top five Montreal eateries. The palak paneer is so delicious! And so reasonably priced. If I lived any closer I would probably eat here every day..."}
{"text":"This place has a terrible ambiance and even worse service but, you just absolutely can't beat the food. By far the best samosas and nan bread around. The prices are extremely reasonable, the food is fresh and all homemade. It is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Went to Montreal for labour day weekend, our friend took us to this Gem of a place. the food is amazing and the prices unbelievable. The have very good Thali, but I would recommend ordering their main dishes. The quantity is just right and the price is around $4, you can order 4-5 different things and share with friends. 

I would have been ordering my food couple of times a week if I lived there. Even though the owner was short staffed that day and busy, the food came out pretty quick and fresh."}
{"text":"My first visit to Montreal.  Firstly, I LOVE U MONTREAL.  
We were staying at the crown plaza and the second to last night, we just wanted to get some warm food to go and relax in the hotel room.  That's when we came across Pushap on Yelp and I have to say, just amazing. 
Samosas: In my opinion, absolutely fantastic. They were not warm but yet, full of flavor.
Paneer: truly felt home cooked. 
Cholle: again, fabulous. Just wished for a little onion and cilantro.
Potato Sandi with green peas: this was my least favorite simply because I think there was no ingredient to tackle the fresh sweet peas and carrots.
Chappati: amazing
Batoora: fantastic flavor. On the oily side but hey, it is a fried item.

When I come back to Montreal,  definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Je suis aller à Pushap la première fois avec une amie qui connaît très bien la place et elle a très bien su me guider à travers leur menu. Ils ont un menu écrit mais c'est surtout du fait au jour le jour donc il y a beaucoup de chose qui ne sont pas disponibles mais qui sont indiquées. 

Je vous conseillerai de commander un samosa chaat avec thali, leurs samosas sont plus que délicieux !!! Et le thali vous permet de goûter un repas typiquement indien avec plein de petits plats si vous n'êtes pas familier avec cette cuisine. Je conseillerai également le Shaï Paneer (plat à base de fromage et tomate) qui est à tomber par terre. 

Je tiens également à préciser que c'est le seul restaurant indien où j'ai vu une aussi grande sélection de desserts indiens !! Pas juste la boule de pâte trempée dans le sirop, tellement plus de choix (comme le julibe, et plein d'autres à base de noix de coco, YUMMY!).

Les prix sont plus que raisonnables et vous pouvez partir le ventre plein pour 10$ par personne !  Bref en conclusion je vous conseille très fortement d'aller faire un tour près du métro Namur !"}
{"text":"Final try.  Ordered food for pick up.  Waited, messed up my order with another persons.  Lucky him got his food.  Waited. One, two, three plus customers after...waiting.  Watch stuff get served with bare hands (saw this happen before but I can overlook that kinda thing when you leave quickly).  Waiting...saw kids go into the kitchen coming out with food in their hands, no fish nets no gloves several people in and out.  Leave no food.  This place has been fined many times over, I stopped ordering for a long time.  We tried again, I try to not look at the mess or the fact that I constantly wait for food that's been ordered.  No more."}
{"text":"Traditional Indian home cooked vegetarian deliciousness.  This one of my all time favourite comfort & soul food go-to places. 

I don't know what kind of service others expect for a delicious & complete Meal placed in front of you for under $10?!
It's family run for over 25 years now. 
Our late Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau used to eat here back when they only had 3 tables!

Coming down with something? Pushap's Thali plate (daily special) has all the spices you need to combat viruses & boost your immune system.

GO NATIVE : Ditch your spoon & eat with your right hand. Tasty! ;)

CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Do you like Indian food? Do you like it cheap? Are you hungry? If you answered yes to these prior questions, then you'll enjoy eating at Pushap! 

Enticed by the numerous positive reviews, I decided to give it a try and enjoyed it very much. Pushap, a small Indian restaurant near Namur metro, offers a variety of cheap, tasty and filling vegetarian meals. The thali are around $6.49 each or you can get a whole meal for two, including entrée, main course and tea or coffee, for $17.99. Bring cash dear Yelpers, as although the prices are cheap, Pushap is cash-only! 

Pushap serves big portions yet the food is light on the stomach - a relief since I love Indian food so much but often find my tummy upset at my culinary choices, especially when heavy spice is involved. 

The reason for the four stars, rather than five? Well, the place, although usually clean, looks a bit shabby and old, decorated with leafy garlands, its walls decorated with crooked Indian paintings. The bathrooms feature a clean toilet but have dirty walls and floors. While I don't consider myself a superficial person and visit a restaurant mainly for the quality of its food, I don't find myself too impressed by the decor.

Next time you step in and hear the distinct Indian tunes playing as you cross the door, make sure to try one of their nice meals, or perhaps a dal soup for $1.50 if you're on the go, and don't forget to try one of their sweet cakes - deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Very Very Good Food. Prices are Affordable, and the food has great value for the price. Not the best in the service department though but thats coool with me and the food works best for it. highly recommendable!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very authentic Indian food. Though there are many Indian cuisines restaurants where I live, this one is the winner! I really enjoy everything we ordered. Service is a bit slow and waiter is not attentive due to many guests. They were still polite serving us and we have no problem with that. Solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"An authentic sweet shop which serves variety of sweets and lip smacking snacks and food. Simply reminded me of Indian sweet shops way back in my hometown.

The bhel Puri had tangy flavor which was balanced with right spices. The khova jamoon had brilliant taste and tasted really fresh. 

The breads were served hot to the table, we tried the bhaturas and paneer parata. Awesome texture and great taste. Tried the shahi paneer which was rich and had onion n tomato purée with bits of cashews.

We also got a box of kaju Kati.

Everything was at reasonable prices!

No matter how hungry you are this place is a must stop by."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food that feels like you are eating in someone's home. I highly recommend this place. I'm usually hard to please with Indian food but this place truly impresses. 
I would have given it 5 stars if the service was faster. Only 1 server for a dozen tables (almost all full on a Monday night!!) was a bit much. The service was still friendly and helpful. 

Definitely worth the visit :)"}
{"text":"Pushap is the ultimate combination of cost, taste and service. No matter how busy they are, your food will come quickly, and it's always delicious. 

Recommendation: The daily thali (vegetarian plate) is $6.50 after tax. It comes with 3 \"dishes,\" a naan, rice and coleslaw."}
{"text":"i ate the bread. they were about to close but they let me order another bread. i ate it. i got it done. i did what i had to do."}
{"text":"I had their veg thali and it was really bad. Had it with my friend during our office lunch time and she dint like it too. Their gravies were totally bad! Will never go again there"}
{"text":"Amazing Vegetarian food in Montreal. Its a really small hole-in-a wall kinda establishment, family run serving amazing and tasty Indian food. The thali mean consisting of Rice, Bread (Fried or Baked), Lentils or Chickpea curry, Potato curry and 1 additional dish of the day. All this costs just CAD 7.

Walk in, seat yourself at a table and the friendly host will come and take your order. They do have a menu that you can order from, but I have always settled for the thali as the amount of food served is just to my needs. 

During lunch and dinner times, it does get busy and often see unclean tables. But once you get seated, you'll see the friendly owner immediately rush to your assistance, get the tables cleaned, bring water and menu and take your order.

Great place a quick, cheap & tasty, vegetarian mean in Montreal! Word of caution, this establishment is CASH ONLY!!!"}
{"text":"Pros:
1) Decent food
2) Vegetarian restaurant - lot of options for vegetarians
3) Cheap prices

Cons:
1) Not good ambience - a bit of renovation would help a lot.
2) Cash only"}
{"text":"Cheap and fresh! You can eat for a couple of bucks of have a bunch of homemade sweets for a fraction of the price. There isn't that many comparatives in Montreal when it comes to Desi food but despite that, still a great spot... close to de l'Acadie metro and right on Jean-Talon!"}
{"text":"Wow. Simply wow. Came here based on the reviews and confirmed why people rave about this place. Not only is the food great at low prices, EVERYONE comes here to eat in or take out. By everyone I mean people from all backgrounds - blacks, whites, Arabs, even Chinese! I surveyed a few friends who love Indian food - no one has seen any Chinese people at Indian restaurants. At Pushap, they appear to be regulars. Customers come in all age groups, too. I witnessed two teenage white boys, young 20-something Middle Eastern men and women, and 30- to 70-year-olds. Sorry I sound strange but these sights are new to me in an Indian restaurant. Generally I see 98% Indian customers. Here, I estimate no more than 40%. And loads of people from many different backgrounds. I get the sense that people love this place and I see why."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here already, you're missing out. This is the best/cheapest food in city. You will not miss meat at all. The samosas are exceptional. The portion are ginormous."}
{"text":"I don't care that I have to shlep all the way to Namur to sit in a neon lit space with plastic plants for decoration, this restaurant is the bomb. 

Oh man. The food is so flavorful and so delicious and so cheap that it is the best price/quality ratio in the city. It's a completely vegetarian restaurant but the food is so umami that even if you do dine on swine you'll leave fully satisfied.

Also be forewarned that they don't serve booze and it's cash only."}
{"text":"I was sure I discovered a hidden jem, but with over 90 Yelp reviews it seems everyone except me knew about this cool place.
I must warn you things here are extreamly spicey BUT if you like hot food this is heaven. An authentic vegetarian / vegan friendly Indian resturant that is also not pricey (6-7$ for a Tali plate) if only it was closer to my house / work. If you are hungry go there and thank me latter."}
{"text":"If you ever wondered how can a vegetarian be satisfied this is how, having Indian food. Every dish is delicately perfumed with spices and fragrances that took you miles away. I had the paneer in a tomato sauce, roasted eggplant with onion and an okra dish. My plate also came with the delicious chickpeas. Excellent not too spicy not too salty. Now the reason lots of people come here are the sweets, I've been sent here by an India friend who think they are better than in India because it's not as sweet. He was right. I was overwhelmed with the variety. Would be back anytime but wish it's a bit far from me, hope this type of authentic Indian food could come to Plateau one day."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant. The food has delicious flavors, the atmosphere is very unassuming, the prices are way too low, and the deserts are phenomenal.

I haven't been, since I visited Montreal in 2005, but it was still just as good as when I lived there in 2002. I miss this place sorely."}
{"text":"Une place de choix pour des végétariens et les amoureux des épices indiennes! Le service est très rapide et les prix tellement abordables! Choisissez le menu du jour, et ils vous demanderont un choix de pois chiches ou lentilles et de pain traditionnel au four ou frit. Personellement, j'ai beaucoup aimé les lentilles, beaucoup plus de sauce et tellement trop bon! Le pain traditionnel est mieux mais il intéressant d'essayer celui au four, le petit croustillant vient rajouter un petit je-ne-sais-quoi. Et surtout, ne partez pas sans essayer leur dessert!  Ils ont tellement un choix varié et vous pouvez demander une dégustation à votre serveur! On était cinq et ça nous a couté moins de 40$ pour le groupe! Une place à rajouter dans votre carnet d'adresses!"}
{"text":"Food is good enough, especially for the price. But the service was pretty bad and it's cash only."}
{"text":"Cheap and good enough vegetarian indian food, busy place, the desserts are really good. Many tables."}
{"text":"It's a little embarrassing how often I'm here. In any case, this place carried me through several years of (broke) vegetarianism and has continued to be my favourite Indian joint in the city. I'm convinced that if you buy a delicious samosa or Indian sweet in this city, it likely comes from Pushap.

I love this place so much that even the waitress, that I'm convinced hates me with every fiber of her being, is endearing.

You gotta try it."}
{"text":"Les samosas sont juste parfaits, le goût et la texture: paradis. La sauce au tamarin, je vous met au défi de ne pas y mettre une paille pour la finir avec votre dernière bouchée. C'est abordable et bon comme un péché."}
