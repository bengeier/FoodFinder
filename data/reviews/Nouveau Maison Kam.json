{"text":"In Restaurant or delivery , food is great !  For lunch, it is cheap and fast.  For diner, the dish ranges between 10 and 14$ +rice or noodles, but there is enough for 2 people.   We've gotten different things and its always been great.  This is our favorite chinese place in the area."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant on the West Island.  I came here at least once per month, and was never disappointed. The food quality is really good, inexpensive, and the portion is huge (unlike some other restaurant, I'm looking at you Tong Por).  The waiters are always very friendly and the service is fast, efficient, and food comes out of the kitchen really usually within 10 minutes after the order."}
{"text":"We have been gong to this Chinese restaurant , since it moved from the Cote Des Neiges area, the food is always top notch, and hot. Recently on the last two visits, the food is not coming out as hot as usual, and last time had to send it back. Don't go during the week, as they have less staff and it takes too long to get your order. recently we went back again, and waited over an hour for our meal, and it was one of their selected meals. It's a smaller place but the staff that serves should be changed, and not use the owners son, who has a bad attitude at times."}
{"text":"I had here an excellent fish in ginger sauce pot, very good fried dumplings and a not so good beef with 2 types of onions. It is a pretty decent solid small Chinese restaurant. I liked it."}
{"text":"I was blown away by this restaurant.When I was told that we were having a family dinner at Maison Kam I was not expecting the food to be so good. You can imagine - The West Island is not quite known for having great Thai and Chinese restaurants. But Maison Kam is here to change that stereotype. The food is fresh and portions are huge for a group.   Their General Tao chicken is good - not much batter, and nice chunks of white meat. Although the sauce is brown - and more sweet than spicy or tart. Almost like a BBQ sauce. Everything on the menu that we tried was great.   Certainly somewhere I'm going to go to again."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I have ever tasted! Not sure if eating in the restaurant is better than delivery, but I just had it delivered and I will NEVER order there again. I should have caught on when they said they don't accept anything but cash... My noodles were burnt, the General Tao Chicken was tasteless and the rice was over cooked... I have pictures..."}
{"text":"Not bad for west island, and pretty inexpensive. 3.5 stars. We came with my family for lunch one day and ordered pretty standard fare: fried Cantonese noodles, house fried rice, and beef hor fun. The food came pretty quickly, even though there was only one guy working at the time. The best dish was the fried rice, which was fragrant and flavorful. The broad hor fun noodles lacked the \"wok hei\" flavour and honestly, I think my hubby makes the dish better at home. The Cantonese noodles were okay, although for some reason they substituted a different kind of white ramen-like noodle instead of the thinner yellow crispy one that is typically used. We will come here again if in the area, but if craving more authentic fare, we will probably drive to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I love this place especially for the lunch special. It is cheap (~13-15$ tax and tip in) and is delicious and filling. I have been coming here for years and although there has been a slight decrease in quality, it is still my favourite Chinese restaurant in Montreal. The servers are not warm and fuzzy but get the job done. The soups are yummy and they serve tea and orange slices with the meal. I recommend this place specifically for lunch on a weekday when it is considerably less busy. Make sure to check your order if you take out because there are often mistakes."}
