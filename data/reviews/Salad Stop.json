{"text":"I used to really like this place but the fact they are trying to pinch a penny is obvious.  My salad dressing is watered down to the point of being milk-like.  The lettuce leaves are the outside leaves of the romaine (therefore tough and inedible).  The feta cheese, instead of nice chunks, is like feta dust on my salad.

Plus  there are mushrooms and chopped carrots in my Greek salad, neither of which is listed on the menu and neither did I request.

Avoid this place and drive in the opposite direction to Salad Works on Rt 30."}
{"text":"I ordered a cajun pasta and It was tasteless and stale. Chicken feels like rubber. I guess they just pull everything out of freezer, boil it in hot water and hand it over to me.  The guy who made it is not even a cook. The salad portions are so small, You will still be left hungry. Ceasar dressing was watered down. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. The salads are skimpier than ever and the staff is super stingy with the toppings, and I'm never someone who asks for extras. For $9, can I please have more than three olives in my salad?

The staff never, ever strikes me as friendly, but rather annoyed and bothered. I gladly tip when my salad is made, but jeez, can you manage at least a \"thanks for coming in\" before I leave? Anything? And no, grunting doesn't count. I'm at the point where I feel uncomfortable NOT tipping, but the service is so bad that its seems like a joke when I do. Coupled with the meager offerings, I've basically stopped going in. Which sucks, because SS used to be a lunchtime staple during my work week."}
{"text":"I just had the most boring salad ever.  I mean places where they serve a wedge of iceburg lettuce and a glop of ranch dressing would get a higher review than this place.

and to be honest, when I eat a salad, I am doing it to 'be good' - so I don't tend towards the 'buffalo chicken fried tomatoe' big salad.  But come on, fresh veggies with a little tuna on top should at least have something to it.

Instead, this thing felt like a bowl of bland - even with the dressing (which they love to claim they have a HUGE assortment of) did little to induce a taste bud from even waking up bite after bite.

when you are a fat bastard and want to drop a few pounds, you lean on places like this to make it more palatable.  instead, I walked out of here and almost walked right into Cheeseburger Cheeseburger just to prove that I hadn't lost one of my more favorite senses.

{"text":"Salad Stop, I really wanted to like you.  I really wanted to find a great, healthy place to eat that is close by.  Unfortunately I don't think I will return.  The salad was just so so and the dressing, while not \"gelatinous and fatty\" was really watered down and tasted like milky sugar water.  

They also give you airline quality utensils.  That was the cherry atop a cold mashed potato cake."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place was undergoing a renovation due to a recent kitchen fire and my second choice was a soup storefront that just closed for good.  I went to the Salad Stop by default and was pleasantly surprised by the various combo's which were available to me.  Since today was cold and damp, I wanted to get a soup and pannini combo.  Unfortunately, they just ran out of soup at 11:45AM.  I wasn't advised to how long it would take to make some more soup, so I choose the buffalo chicken pannini and Greek salad combo.  The presentation was good. The quality and quantity was good.  The taste was fine.  Overall, my visit by default was well worth the visit.  I plan on returning."}
{"text":"Salad Stop was great a while ago but has steadily gone downhill. While the menu variety is good, the ingredients are bland and ordinary. 

On my last visit I had the Hawaiian Chicken salad with Mango Vinaigrette dressing. The romaine lettuce was old, tough, and bland, while dressing was too gelantinous and fatty (as noted by another reviewer).

The interior is looking a bit run-down and I've seen too many flies hovering around the counter and tables. They also have a \"no refills\" policy on their $1.70 fountain sodas -- even though it's rarely enforced I find it outrageous consdering how little that cup of soda actually costs them.

Meh! I think next time I'll just head to the nearby Wegmans instead!"}
{"text":"Couldn't disagree more with the last yelper. The topping selection alone is worth the trip. They have everything that you could ever want on a salad from blackened salmon to buffalo chicken, feta cheese to mozzarella. The toppings are endless, they have over 20 or so dressings and a wide range of other items including pitas, paninnis, and rice bowls. A great option for lunch in the Frazer area."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed. The only thing I really wanted was the buffalo chicken panini, which they were out of so I got the chicken and pepper jack panini. The chicken was HORRIBLE. Not sure where they got it but you could tell it was bulk frozen stuff. Wont be returning.

Bottom line; Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here for a nice healthy lunch and ordered thr blackened salmon salad with Mango vinagrette. The portion i recieved was huge and very enjoyable. The owner and staff were very attentive and friendly. Prices were reasonable and we were asked upon exiting how our meal was which was a plus to me."}
