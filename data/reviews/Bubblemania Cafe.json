{"text":"This place is known mostly for their cheap wings and depending on who you ask, their bubble tea. 
I must say that the place has gone down over the years. Before the wings were huge and you couldn't finish it all. Now they are tiny and no sauce on the ones that need to.

The service here is okay, you have to call them over or they won't come. The place is filled with young adults and they tend to talk to their friends at the place. Though they are friendly and are helpful.

The food is ordinary. I must say the wings are cheap like .40 cents for wings. THATS IF YOU BUY A $5 drink. It's terrible because even if you didn't want wings you'd have to buy a drink so the cheap wings apply. Overall the wings are very good but small. The fried rice is amazing and I can eat that alone.

I hate to admit it but bubblemania is not the same."}
{"text":"We live near here and since the kids love bubble tea we sometimes eat here.
It's had is ups and downs, but today we stopped in for a few plates of wings and bubble tea all around. 

The service was courteous and prompt. The drinks were excellent. The wings were also very good. We were particularly fond of the garlic parm and salt and pepper flavors. They came hot and crispy. Still juicy on the inside. Excellent. 

Didn't care for the spicy honey. Tasted good, but to messy and sticky. The sauce took the crunch away and also cooled of the wings."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only bubble tea place I go to now.
Parking is terrible but the food and drinks (though sometimes way to sweet) are good. Wings are great and the service is hit and miss depending on who you get.  Still, A LOT faster than Dessert House."}
{"text":"I love the wings here!! And bubble tea too of course :) I go here on a regular basis, service is friendly and place is kept clean. I

If you love bubble tea you gotta try  Bubblemania!! :)"}
{"text":"Bubblemania Cafe is a great place for teenagers and young adults to enjoy either bubble tea and/or savoury snacks. The atmosphere is filled with joy and excitement and a great place to hang out in groups or to go on a date.

The parking lot is very limited based on a first come first serve basis since the cafe shares the lot with a nearby restaurant but there is always parking around the residential area and access to an open lot across the cafe so don't fret there is always parking. The cafe is also accessible by bus for those who doesn't drive and doesn't want to take a taxi.

The service is phenomenon even when they are busy you will still get instant friendly service since the work place environment is very fast paced. 

The food is spectacular and is broken down into 7 different categories: Small Plates To Share, Wings, Noodle Soups, Large Plates To Share, Mains, Daily Special, and Desserts. Their drink menu consists of variety of drinks from Signature Smoothies and Signature Slushes to Milk Tea and Milkshakes to Pop and Aloe Vera.

I would recommend Bubblemania to others and would visit more frequently."}
{"text":"Bubble tea is just okay, not anything special. Better than the ones in the mall.
We also had wings, again nothing special.

The only thing that set this place apart from others is the ambience.
The restaurant is obviously catered towards kids. When I walked in everyone turned around to look, the place is filled with highschool kids screaming. I felt like I had just walked into chuck e cheese.
It's dark, loud, and cramped. Like a nightclub for minors."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for wings and \"bubble tea\". The regular and the salt and pepper wings were fresh and crispy. They have a Happy Hour special -  wings for $0.25 Mon thru Thurs... and many flavours to choose from. I also tried their fresh fruit slushy (jackfruit) and it was delicious. The japanese-style deep fried scallops were alright but a little on the dry side.  Overall the experience was OK. I would go back... While the food was just alright (nothing amazing), it's a nice relaxing atmosphere to hang out and the service was good."}
{"text":"I've only had the bubble tea here but it is great! The go to is the Taro/Coconut! Excellent."}
{"text":"It's ight, teeny bopper, heatbag hang out spot, once you get pass the couple of stares you receive when you get in, it's a O K, the food is alright, the bbt is standard, the only reason this place is really popular is because it's more of a hang out spot, use to come here a lot but the crowd that goes there ain't for me."}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab a bubble tea. Mango avacado with pearls is a must try. Customer service is always top notch. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"A little gem in a central location. Excellent and quick service. The food and drinks were great."}
{"text":"My favorite place for wings and bubble tea. been a fan for 10+ years. Dewdrop is the best drink hands down!"}
{"text":"Bubble mania is a really cool place to hang out with your friends and they're open pretty late so it's usually a go to place for food. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"I will preface my review by saying I'm from Southern California, which has a plethora of boba (bubble tea) options. So I am reviewing this in relation to he boba I have back home. The bubble tea is terrible. The boba is so soft it doesn't have the characteristic chewiness of tapioca. The tea (I got green tea with normal sugar) was super watery and didn't have much sugar, basically tasting like water. 

The price was very high for the quality of drink I got. I am not sure if other bubble teas nearby charge a similar price but $5.50 was too high. The drink is probably a $3.50 max drink. For reference the Quickly store, which is a low price boba chain in SoCal has a green tea boba that is probably around $3.00 (USD) that tastes better than the tea I got at Bubblemania.

The environment is dingy. I get that it's a hangout but you can make it a cool, young, hip environment if it didn't feel so dirty.

I think ultimately the issue with the establishment is there is not enough competition in this food space so they have no motivation to improve. That may be a major contributing factor for their lackluster drink offering."}
{"text":"my cousin and i usually are really easy going with our waiters, but our waiter here was just so shit (keep in mind my cousin and i use to love coming to bubble mania).

He sat us down and gave us our menu and walked away. He didn't ask if we would like water or anything. After 10 min or so we were ready to order but he didn't even come back to ask us if we were ready, we had to look around and call for him (which was really hard). After we got our food, we wanted some water. We had to look around for a good 10 min for our waiter to walk by to ask for it, and after 10 min of waiting for it he didn't even bring it so we asked a different waiter. 

Overall, our waiter didn't seem to care if we needed anything. And that bubble mania has to step up their service"}
{"text":"Always busy on weekends, Bubblemania is usually the de facto spot to head for bubble tea and chat with friends.

AMBIENCE/SERVICE: A decently large establishment that can get quite stuffy and loud on busy nights. Lighting is rather dark. It's also a nightmare to park especially when it's busy. Staff is friendly and servers were quite attentive. 1.5/2.5

FOOD: When I am hungry, I will usually order the Pacific or House Special Fried Rice, which are both quite good and a good portion for one person or even to share. The bubble tea is generally hit and miss, most drinks are a bit overpriced for how mediocre they are but the pearls tend to be pretty fresh. I was excited to try their HK style milk tea and coffee, hoping it would bring back memories of Vancouver, but alas, it was only an expensive knockoff. 1.5/2.5"}
{"text":"Once upon a time in Calgary, I was hungry. Thankfully I was in a car with my friend and he was hungry too. So we both decided to drive somewhere to eat. He thought of Peters' Drive-In and this place. We saw the line-up at Peters' - no way in hell we'd be lining up. So Bubblemania it was. My friend described it as like a chill techno club that wasn't a club but was actually a cafe where all the hot Asians go to hang out. As someone who fancies the Asian ladies, I knew I had to go check them out. 

I got Taiwanese Spiced wings (which, oddly enough tasted like things I had in Taiwan), Korean Hot wings (saucy and spicy) and a drink they called \"It Takes Two To Mango\". So clever. Wings were good and decently priced, and I love mango, so that mango drink was an automatic winner by default. Might go here again to collect some phone numbers."}
{"text":"I LOVED their Strawberry Pocky Bubble Tea, it tasted just like Strawberry Pocky, and if I remember correctly, it even came with a stick or two. In fact, I loved it so much I've been trying to find a place in Toronto that serves it, so if you know of a place that does, please do inform me (and NO they don't have it at Destiny's).The décor was nothing special, for some reason it almost felt like a giant house party or something. Either way it was definitely a completely different Bubble Tea experience from Toronto. They even serve you the tapioca in a separate bowl and you put it in yourself! How interesting...."}
{"text":"The worst place ever. I've only been here twice and both times the food was disgusting. I've never had they're wings but when I asked the waiter what's popular he said mango chicken... So that's what I got. Straight up microwave food flavour. My friend from Vancouver also did not like the place and we did not even finish our meals or bubble teas because it was just bad. 
I'm assuming most people writing a review are either too young to recognize good food or friends of staff because it was below average food both times for me."}
{"text":"I love bubblemania! They have great food and drinks, I love their green tea and their bubble tea! I always order the strawberry flavour. I also love their chicken wings and fried rice. The only thing I would say is they are always a bit full and sometimes you do wait a while so I would suggest make a reservation before heading down."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Asian cafe that offers good eats and tasty treats, then Bubblemania is the place for you! 

They have daily specials (including 40 cents wings Mon-Thurs, 60 cents on Fri!) and a very comprehensive drink menu that would quench any thirst you may have!

Although the parking lots is a bit of a cluster to deal with (I'd recommend parking in the residential area just behind the strip mall and walk over) if go during non peak times it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Wings were delicious, wish there were more drum sticks.

Coffee ice cream shake was yummy.

Mushroom dumplings were the best I've ever tasted... Don't burn it and everything will be ire.

Taro slush was refreshingly creamy.

Sweet toast was acceptable to my high stands.

Jack fruit shake was okay, could have been sweeter."}
{"text":"Bubblemania Cafe is the perfect place to go to with a group of friends or family. I typical we go here for their wings! Their wings are decent sized and have pretty good flavour selection. They have a huge selection of bubble tea (boba) flavours. To get cheap wings everyone at the table has to buy a drink! 

To be honest, I never like any of the drinks here. I feel they are a bit watered down with a lot of artificial taste. We ordered the aloe vera peach flavour and jasmine milk tea. Aloe vera peach was okay, a bit sugary with a lot of ice. The Jasmine Tea was watered down, we asked for no sugar and it taste like jasmine tea with no milk (but it looks like the put a splash of milk?)

For the wings, we ordered Korean hot, garlic parm, and roasted garlic. The korean hot was delicious, a bit spicy, and sticky! Garlic Parm has a lot of garlic flavour with  parm, if you like garlic and Parm get this! As for the roasted garlic.... it taste like wings with seasoning salt or MSG it was still good but does not have any flavour of garlic....

Overall, it was good and this place is consistently busy! Their service was fast and you will get ur drink and food fast!"}
{"text":"Today I visited. I tried smoothie and wings !
Smoothie named \"lonely\" it was perfect for me! So goooooood and I heard that their wings are the best ! It was right ! Yam!"}
{"text":"I can only tell you about the wings in this place.  They were fantastic.
The place was hopping, and the staff were jumping.  There was other food on the menu, but we didn't get to it. Because wings.  I wished we'd left room for the chocolate banana smoothie thingie.  But, wings!"}
{"text":"Came for late night bubble tea with some friends, 20 mins before closed, they said they were closed because the kitchen was off but accepted the medium sized group that walked in one minute before us. Mediocrity at best, garbage service. Not worth supporting IMO."}
{"text":"It's easy to see why this restaurant is PACKED. Terrific value--great tasting food. Killer combination. We were a table of 8 all ordering different things. Everything was great. And it's so. I've to see a menu these days with so many single-digit prices."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good here but the service is little slow to start. Come here often with my clients and family. Drinks are always consistent, the thing that I love most are their chicken wings I can eat 2 dozens of those. I like the fact that I can customize my drinks just like Starbucks."}
{"text":"Just picked up our take out drink order (Jun 23, 2016). 730pm order, 745pm arrive and paid the bill. The cashier guy made us wait until 8pm then asked me what I was waiting for. The drinks were in the fridge next to the cashier. He barely apologized. I should of asked for a refund. I will not be returning. Bad service. They think their time is worth more than mine."}
{"text":"Solid bubble tea café. You can't go wrong here. This is my favorite joint for bubble tea in Calgary. The food here is good too. So you can wash down a greasy, tasty late night food with some bubbletea.

We had an amazing server who went above and beyond the typical service. Thanks man!"}
{"text":"From the states here!! And I've have always been coming to bubble mania every time I am in town. But this place has changed a lot since I came 8 years ago. I believe it took over the business to the left of it. And the menu has changed or well the layout at least. The old menu looked like they had more variety of bobas but they still have the ones I like (shooting star and red bean) the wing portion size also looked like it got smaller and they don't give out drum sticks anymore ?!? Weird.

The service here is usually pretty good. The people are usually nice most of the time and the ambiance is very chill. They don't anything close to this in the east coast unless you live in NY where there is a bunch of Asians but not VA. 

I usually come here for the drinks since they have a bunch of different kinds that we do not have which is awesome."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for bubble tea hands down.  Any time we are driving to Calgary I must stop here for bubble tea and chicken wings (which I love because there are no drumstick pieces!).  They have original flavors, and the cost is definitely reasonable!

My husband always gets the rice which is a huge portion, full of chicken, pineapple, etc. and very delicious!  This can be eaten as a meal.

The best bubble tea for me is blueberry milk bubble tea (real fruit) with pearls.  The other mixed varieties are excellent too... I always ask them to be made with milk as this is my preference, but you can get them in a frozen slurpee form or as juice as well!

Really packed in the evenings (but I get mine to go).

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"this place has GREAT FOOD but HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. if you're down to exchange one for the other, then go right ahead. once again, the food is great and it comes out pretty fast BUT that depends on the mood of the staff. I go here maybe at least 1-2x a month, and i can probably count on one hand how many times I received even \"OKAY\" customer service. I have literally come on a non-busy day, ordered my food, and waited 20 mins (as I watched the table beside me get seated, order their food, receive their food, then watched the wait take 3 bites from his personal lunch, take a few gulps of water) AND THEN, did they bring my food. so like i said, if you have the patience for the bad customer service, then go ahead."}
{"text":"We always look forward to our casual nights out here. Their lemon pepper wings have got to be our favourite wings ever! Beats out wing nights at the local pub every time... hot, juicy, perfect dry rub -- I'm salivating already, and we just returned from a wing feast. 

Also a sizeable selection of mains and appetizers. Their fried rice is always a hit, the pork belly is worth the guilt, and their beef noodle soup is the ultimate comfort food. Had the unagi-don tonight, which was our least favourite item so far. Not a lot of unagi on top of a heck of a lot more rice. Love their bubble tea -- the hot almond milk tea is a go-to choice.

Fun and casual atmosphere. Often gets pretty busy, so be prepared to wait for service at peak times."}
{"text":"They are consistently good with amazing wings and drinks. The service is always super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been going to bubbles for a really long time  now. My spot of choice if I am not craving ovaltine bubble tea (which they don't carry) and want some wings. Walking in  the restaurant you can see it is very simple.

Bubblemania has a baby blue, brown, white and black interior which I find is a very neat and simple theme for them. The tables and chairs are set up in a grid like manner, a total \"restaurant city\" style.

I ordered the Avocado smoothie with Pearls on the side, my favorite drink there besides the Lonely By Myself, Jade and a few other ones I don't quite remember the names of.

My friends and I had also ordered a bunch of wings but I really only ever eat one kind - the salt and pepper flavor ones, I don't eat saucy wings so I can't comment, too messy for my pretty fingers lol.

We also ordered the Chinese Sausage Fried Rice and with a little hot sauce it made it extra delicious!"}
{"text":"I like that this place is open late, it is often really busy. I haven't tried the food but the bubble tea and potted teas are really good... 
The restaurant always smells like fish, I have the nose of a dog, but it sometimes makes me feel ill. They need better ventilation. 
Large selection of drinks and snacks. There is usually parking out front which is good. Loud so don't go on a date here if you wanna hear each other speak. They also run out of pearls usually by 10pm so go early!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, it feels like everyone turns their head and stares at you. The food is alright, BBT is a little overpriced as you can get it Downtown for $4. The service is alright, if you're lucky, you can get an experienced server.
Had a very bad experience once (to my friend), the server asked for more tip and even said \"have you parents never taught you how to tip?\" 

The food is decent, good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5
Drinks: 2.5/5
Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 2/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Bubblemania (Bubbles) has been through about 3.. maybe 4 renos over the past 8 years. Its recent renos includes expanding into the space next to it which provides twice as many seats as before, and is more open/spacious. Its layout and decor has changed drastically; you can barely recognize it from the old Bubbles. 

The decor is very simple yet sleek with white tables and black pleather seats, but has a deary brownish/grey paint job. They also have an unfinished ceiling where you can see the vents which leaves the place looking unpolished. However, they have coolest looking chandeliers above their booths which is shaped as a giant light bulb with a glowing ball of fibrous filament. 

For a Tuesday night it was packed! There were a ton of servers working, a lot of familiar faces and a lot of new and young trainees. The servers are all dressed in the same T-shirts with a sentence plastered on the back to say that they worked there. The atmosphere is casual and the servers are laid back so don't expect too much. I usually have to wait 5-10min before our server greets us and takes our order. Then they leave you alone until you wave them over. On the plus side, the drinks and food came out fast.

Bubbles simplified their menu to two pages with drinks (which has been downsized) on one side, and a greater variety of food on the other. Their drinks includes: Signature Smoothies and Slushies ($5); Fresh Fruit Juice ($5.30); Teas ($6); Avocado drinks ($5.50); Green or Black Tea ($4.5); Milk Teas ($4.30-$4.70); Aloe Vera/Italian Soda ($4.30); and Milkshakes ($5.30). Their prices have increased but the size remains the same as before (a large glass). 

My bf ordered a \"Strawberry Fresh Fruit Juice\" that is blended with ice, sugar (ordered without), and fruit syrup. Even without the sugar, the drink was overly sweet and didn't taste fresh. I used to love this drink but now I will avoid it. I ordered a \"Black Sesame Chocolate Milkshake\", but was disappointed in the way it tasted. The consistency was icy/slushy, and I couldn't taste the sesame despite seeing pieces of it. It was like drinking a chocolate syrup slush. Not worth the money! 

Their food menu consists of a variety of new and old appetizers ($5-8); fried rice, and udon ($9.20); Wings ($7.50 for 10); and Dessert (cheesecake, thick toast, fruit plate, fondue) from $4-$20. 

Their wing \"special\" only occurs every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday at 40 cents a wing. We tried their new Korean flavour which was very sweet and had a ton of garlic pieces. It wasn't spicy even though they gave it a rating of 2 chilis. They downsized the wings, and we ended up with random sizes from \"tiny\" to \"small\". The only good thing was that the wings came out hot, fresh and quick.

Overall, the drinks aren't all that good and is a hit and miss. However, I recommend their traditional Avocado drink for something refreshingly creamy. The food is pedestrian and overpriced. 

Bubbles has transformed into a more refined \"cafe\", but don't expect to come for great drinks and food. It's just a nice place to hang out with friends at."}
{"text":"Best place i have ever gone to to get bubble tea! Reasonable price, great service, and seriously the best tasting smoothies ever. Highly recommended! I drive from the other side of the city for this place."}
{"text":"Haven't had the food here but I have enjoyed the bubble tea. The selection is good and my favorite is the coconut milk. The pearls have always been fresh and the staff is nice. Will keep coming here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I like their chicken wings and fried rice. But I try to avoid going on weekend evenings and Friday nights. I usually go between 2pm-3pm but I hope they can open earlier."}
{"text":"This place is always packed! I've never been here half-empty crowd, maybe because there system works really well for the customers to keep coming back aside from their sumptuous food. As Asian, or if you are fan of dry asian food, this is the place. I always come on Saturdays for my wings and scallop treat. Wings is at$.60 cents each (not too sure if it includes Sundays), battered scallop, bubble tea or refreshing drinks amid the cold season made my week!"}
{"text":"Not that great... comparing to the boba shops we have in LA. it was pretty packed but when we arrived there was not really a wait. So I hear that theirs been a change of management, remodeling, and the price of food has gone up. Chicken wings have gone up in price now at $0.75 a wing, we got them with seasoning salt and the wings themselves were not bad, they were fried perfectly, crispy on the outside, still pretty juicy on the inside. The House Special Fried Rice wasn't anything to right home about, a little bland had to add sriracha for some kick and flavor.The Thai Style Pan Fried Udons were pretty good, it had nice flavor and kick with the red curry in it. I ordered a honey green tea with green apple jelly and that was pretty disappointing. I am glad that they give you a separate bowl for the boba or green apple jelly and they don't just add it into your drink however, the tea was like water with tea extract flavoring and the green apple jelly was like drenched in simple syrup. It seems like a pretty happening place to hang out and grab food but if I had my choice, i'd probably try somewhere else next time,"}
{"text":"This place is clearly one of my teenager's favourite cafes for bubble tea and late night snacks, especially if you don't want to participate in any parking wars downtown.  Even if the lot is full Friday nights, parking is still available on the street (there are no zoning restrictions).
The menu for bubble teas and smoothies is extensive (remember to check the blackboard for seasonal specials), and it is required that each person in your party order at least one drink before ordering any food.
My favourite drinks are the hot ginger milk tea with pearls(love the kick of ginger!) and the almond milk tea.
These place also has the cheapest chicken wings in town.  A plate of ten wings go for $7.50, however there are $0.40 wings from Monday to Thursday, and $0.60 wings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  You can order the basic crispy wings to Honey Garlic, Salt & Pepper, Spicy Honey, Lemon Pepper, Taiwanese Spice, Garlic Parmesan, Teriyaki, and Korean Hot. 
Because of the rising prices of meat, they will now charge you extra for each uneaten chicken wing (even if you have to pack it with you). 
My son's favourite entree is the noodle soup (with your choice of vermicelli, glass noodle, ramen or udon).  It's a very hearty, delicious bowl of braised beef brisket or char siu noodle soup with marinated egg and cabbage."}
{"text":"This is a great place for bubble tea, smoothies, shakes, etc. Some of my favourites include the What's Up, the Romantic Calgary, and the black sesame/coconut milkshake. Having said that, the fruity ones are great too! So much variety and it's hard to go wrong...you'll have to make frequent visits just to get a sample of what they have to offer. THE WINGS AND FOOD ARE GREAT TOO. Many varieties of wings to choose from and we have never been let down. The fried rice dishes are also very good, not too greasy. I have been to this place 3 or 4 times for food (and another ten or so for shakes) and there have only been one or two dishes that haven't impressed me. Last of all, the atmosphere is great for anyone; my boys can be a little loud and they didn't seem to mind. Having said that, it can be hard to find a table, or a place to park, during prime hours on weekend nights. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the food didn't blow me away...5 star joints, in my mind, serve at least one or two dishes that are truly exceptional."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been going for bubble tea and wings at Bubblemania since they were a hole-in-the-wall around the early-mid 2000s (when they had black leather couches, playing cards and display of magazines!). I've seen them renovate 2 or 3 times now and seen their business grow! Can't go anywhere else! Their wings actually have juicy meat on them, and they have countless options for drinks, which always deliver in delicousness! It does get pretty busy in the evenings and weekends now days, but wait times are not long at all! Staff are nice and quick, and the food comes out just as fast! Great place to hang with friends or family.. or significant other. Overall, good eats for good prices!"}
{"text":"Good place for Taiwanese style BBT food. Every food item that I've ordered here has been a hit. BBT itself is of average quality; I would come for the wings, fried rice and beef brisket noodle (very hard to find a decent rendition in Calgary)"}
{"text":"The bubble tea is good here! I really like how they give the pearls/sago/bubbles on the side. They have a wide variety of food if you choose to order. They also have daily specials!"}
{"text":"Seriously need to step up there service. They sat us me down and just left without didn't say anything. We had to call the waiter back just to order and they didn't even bring water. We had to ask for it separately. We asked our waiter 2 times for our water and he still didn't bring it, so we had to ask another waiter for our water.  

The food & bbt came quick so that's where the 2 stars come from. While we had our food the waiter didn't check up on us, we had to wait and look around for him to ask for water for the second time. 

Overall, SERIOUSLY START CHECKING UP ON YOUR CUSTOMERS AND SERVE THEM WATER WHEN THEY SIT DOWN!

Still gave them a fucking 15% tip because I'm a dumbass."}
{"text":"Tonight I checked bubblemania's hours while badly craving bubble tea I decide to cab. Says they close at 12.
I call to place an order, im 2 minutes away. It's 11:40.
She interupts me and says \"yeahhhhhhhhhh.... Sorrrrrryyyyyy\"
What?
\"We're closed sorrrrrrry\".
I told her the website says midnight, I am in a taxi and just want 1 bubble tea to go. Sounds like the staff are still there,
\"Yeaaaa, sorrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyy\".

She didn't give a good god damn. 
HONOR YOUR HOURS PLEASE. 
Really lame."}
{"text":"From an American and Californian standpoint, and strictly on the oolong MT with 25% sweetness, I love this place! 

The flavor was on point, the sweetness level was just right, and the grass jelly had just the right amount of firmness without it feeling awkward in my mouth. 

This place will probably get a lot of flak from those who have been more exposed to bubble tea places, particularly from Southern California, because it's not as sweet as they're used to, but I think this is a good thing. The health detriments as a result of ingesting too much sugar are real, and it was refreshing to indulge in a milk tea drink that truly felt like a quarter amount of sugar/simple syrup was put in there, rather than requesting 30% sugar at most milk tea places in the States and getting a drink that tastes like 50-80% sugar. 

For the amount of milk tea places there are in Calgary (which is not too many), this is a decent option for those who crave that bobalife while in the Great North."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I haven't been in this establishment for 2 years until tonight I've always loved coming here until I ate greasy karage chicken which was over battered and made with very little chicken. My pork dumplings tasted like bland perogies saturated in oil. It's so sad to see this once great restaurant go downhill like this. I felt my boyfriend and I were being harassed by someone who seemed to be the assistant manager. She gave me a third degree when I sent the food back and asked for the bill. She insisted nothing was wrong with the food. I told her I just wanted to pay the entire bill so she would leave me alone. She took off a small portion off of the bill as she continued with her rude comments. I will not be coming back and will stop recommending this establishment to my family and friends."}
{"text":"They don't just serve bubble tea and fruit slushies, they've also got an assortment of chicken wings and tapas-style dishes to share, such as Taiwanese-style fried chicken and Thai fish cakes. If you don't mind the lively noise level and the always-packed parking lot, this is a good late-night option. Make sure to check out the feature items on the chalk board, but be warned that popular ones sell out quickly. Servers were friendly and helpful every time I've been here."}
{"text":"Meh.

Coming from Atlanta, I have tried a good number of bubble tea places in my time. Bubblemania is completely different from any that I have tried at home, mostly because the servers that I eyed were not Asian and the ambiance is similar to that of a disco. As someone who enjoys mellow hubbub (is that an oxymoron?!), Bubblemania Cafe was not putting me in my zen zone.

Bubble tea is expensive in Calgary, mostly because the cost of living is high here (relative to the pretty cheap one found in Southeast U.S.). Admittedly, I was tickled when my tea was brought to me in a glass with my tapioca pearls served on the side. What?! I have only had bubble tea in those plastic cups that get sealed and subsequently punctured by me with those super-wide boba-sipping straws. I had an almond black milk tea, which was pretty good. The bubbles (slash pearls slash boba) had a good texture, just firm enough with a nice bite.

I tried chicken wings from an order shared across the table. I heard a bit about them in the car on the way but found them to just be okay. Not bad at all, but not memorable. They were pretty crispy but I could have done without them too.

Just like back home, this place was patronized by young people, which is probably why the cafe has super loud music. They cater to their customers. To be heard, people have to scream over each other but nobody seemed to mind. Or maybe they were just hiding their displeasure much in the same manner that I was concealing my own. Who knows. As soon as my party slurped down our drinks and finished eating the chicken wings (and one person got the fried scallops and really liked them), we paid and headed out.

Cool experience that I may not necessarily repeat. If you are in the mood for a happenin' place with lots of young people (yes... it is dawning on me that I am aging as I refer to teenagers and people in their early 20s as young'ins), loud music, and bubble tea, have I got a place for you!!

Bubblemania Cafe."}
{"text":"My first time at Bubblemania was a revelation.  I had never had bubble tea before, so when my fiance suggested we go with friends, I had no idea what I was getting into.

As most know, and as I quickly discovered, bubble tea is awesome!  I'm partial to anything with mango in it.  Most places that I've been to since offer compatible drinks.  In my experience, actually, most bubble tea tastes the same no matter where you go, with some exceptions.

But where Bubblemania really excels is the atmosphere.  It feels bubblie (probably not a word) and makes for some good bubble tea drinking.  The service is good, but you may run into some issues with the language barrier, as often employees are Asian and still learning english.

As for food, we've had a few items on the menu and they were all pretty good.  However, the wings are nothing short of extraordinary.  We've gone several times for the wings and they are really really good.  Big, juicy, tasty, awesomeness."}
{"text":"Chicken wings and bubble teas are soooo good! Other food are at an average level. Its a great place to socisl with friends. Too bad the hours of operations isn't hood as they dont open early."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to drop by for a nice refreshing bubble tea and some very nice meals. Unfortunately the popularity of the location means you will have to wait for a table. Particularly in the evening times. With groups you are probably best to make a reservation.

Aside from the interesting renovation, the service and menu are both excellent. A great selection of great tasting bubble tea and clean, tasty food makes this a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"This place serves big ass cups of boba. Their chicken wings are yum yum too. I would go back whenever I'm back in Canada"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a quiet night out with friends, or a quieter place to hang out after a rowdy night out. And for both of these occasions, Bubblemania fits the bill.

I've been up here a few times - it is located off of 16th Ave and Edmonton Trail and is quite convenient for me. It's always packed, and I like the lounge like decor and restaurant style seating. It still feels like a classy place to go without some of the accompanying rowdiness.

I was there just last week, and man it felt good to refamiliarize myself with the menu. They have about ten million different kinds of bubble tea - creamy, fresh fruit and non-creamy, and just as many combinations. In addition to bubbles, you can get lychee and green apple jellies, which they give to you separately so you can decide how much you want in your drink. I got the \"dream come true\" which was mango, passion fruit and peach. It was so refreshing and fruit that I slurped it up pretty fast!

The wings were hot and tasty, and super cheap. We ordered 40 wings to split between all of us, hot, super hot, spicy teriyaki and salt and pepper. My favourite was definitely the spicy teriyaki by far. The wings were nice and fresh and big, and covered in sauce. Do not come for wings on date night, and if you get them remember extra napkins!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Bubblemania Café! The food is actually quite tasty and the BBT is good. What I always appreciate is the friendly service. They are always busy in weekends and most evenings but it never stops them from greeting you kindly and taking your order. When ordering takeout they're quite fast. Parking can be tedious at times, but walking a block isn't a huge deal. Sometimes I do find the drinks don't have enough ice, however."}
{"text":"The environment of the restaurant is very casual. The music is good but loud at times. 

The bubble tea is mediocre but mandatory if you want to get wings. Many people order the wings when they come, we decided to order the pork belly and grilled cheese. Both dishes were exceptionally well."}
{"text":"This is officially now one of my favorite places to hang out, first of all its always full of peeps so there is a great energy in the air, plus its full or Asians.. Love that!!

The staff here are polite, efficient and are all hot and the wings are cheap and delicious plus there are like hundreds of exotic drinks to order.

You can have an special funky colorful drink heaped full of fresh tapioca pearls and dozens of orders of wings and it doesnt break your bank account, it doesnt even put a dent in your wallet.

Next time you go, look out for me, I am sure I will be there.. I am usually the loudest person in this place because I am so pleased to be there!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy even at night on a weekday. When I say night, I mean really night. So a young people hang out place. Came here at 10:30 and lucky that we got a seat. The atmosphere is so lively and loud. Not much sound proof. If you are trying to have a conversation here, I might be a bit difficult. 

So I came and I got the wheatgerm milk tea. It was pretty good. I like it. Not too sweet and at first when I saw the wheat on the top of my drink, I was like huh. But it turns out pretty good. I mean it doesn't bother me or that I have to put a lot of effort into chewing. 

I think this place must be famous for their chicken wings. Its like every table orders chicken wings. I mean what's with these wings. (I need to come back to try the wings)

Overall, this place makes good bubble tea."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all.

Bubblemania like a mix between a club and a bubbletea shop but hey, it's a party in there.

We went on Monday night around 10pm and it was packed to the rim. Always a great sign.

Food specials every day. And 35 cent wings? The wings are actual wings meaning wing + wing tip as well. Does that matter? Maybe.

The food is super reasonable and decent.  

4 stars."}
{"text":"If you're a teenager and need a date night spot because you're not allowed into the bars yet and too poor to hit up a fancy restaurant with your new girlfriend yet, then you're probably at Bubblemania Cafe. Seriously, I felt like a chaperone in the sea of teens all hangin' out and drinking bubble tea-staff included.

The selection of bubble teas and drinks is impressive, though if you're in need of a drink without dairy, the selection diminishes a great deal. Bubble tea is available with pearls or lychee jelly. Flip the menu over and you've got your choice of appies to order as well. Apparently the Korean wings are the new thing to try. The girl at the till told us we absolutely had to come back on wing night to try them (wing night is Monday-Wednesday).

Maybe those Korean wings will up this to a 4 star... or maybe not visiting it on a Saturday night... or both! Either way, I'll be headed back to try those wings."}
{"text":"My husband, family members, friends and relatives have gone twice to Bubblemania now.  If you have a large group, you should try to book a reservation or you may not get a table since its often quite busy here.  We love the assorted wings available and I love the bubble teas that are on the menu.  My favorite is mango with passionfruit and of course - I have to have those little bubbles full of juice.  When they get chilled in the drink - its like a ice cold burst of flavor in your mouth !  The last time - they had mango fruit bubbles.... Love them so much !  I also tried and enjoyed the almond sesame hot drink... so tasty and smooth !  We also really enjoy the big platters of yummy fried rice here and get it every time we stop in to dine ... wings, fried rice and ice cold bubble tea.... what more do you want.  Not cheap but a fun place to go check out and enjoy !"}
{"text":"a place with cheap wings all week long, no need to wait for wings night wednesday. drinks are really good, i like the jade special, or almond milk tea iced or hot, for wings i like the salt and pepper or plain with a side of spicy terriyaki  sauce. The pineapple fried rice is good at times sometimes theres not enough pineapple flavor but its good either way and also the house special udon. open late and great for after clubbing or the bar. only down side is the service is kinda slow at times"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a modern feeling, bubble tea place with a good assortment of savory snacks, this is the place to go. The setting is great place for hanging out with a group of friends - good lighting, comfortable seating. The service is fantastic - super friendly and responsive. They also make some great recommendations. 

The Small Plates to Share are exactly that. The Thai Fish Cakes were flavorful and the Deep Fried Fish Balls are a classic. The highlights were definitely the:
- Mushroom Gyoza - comes highly recommended. Cooked in a thin shell, the dumpling is a delicious alternative to the traditional Japanese appy. It offers a mouthful of umami flavor with the miso butter and mushroom combo
- the Garlic Parmesan Wings - crunchy wings that are juicy on the inside and lightly garlic and cheesy on the inside. The perfect compliment to a sweet milk tea drink. 
- the Condensed Milk Thick Toast is like none other. The bread is thick but  surprisingly light and airy. The crunch on the toast is delicate, almost like that of a perfectly toasted marshmallow. 

It gets busy here so make sure to leave a little extra time if you're going with a large party."}
{"text":"I don't know what's up with Bubblemania, in my humble opinion they're going down hill for me.... but I do recall loving the bubble tea and snacks they have so I thought I would give them another chance.   I called them the other day to ask about the hours of operation and found out they now  serve BREAKFAST!!! I asked what kind of breakfast they serve and the gentleman said \"asian fusion with a twist of western food\"....I was soooo excited, BREAKFAST AND BUBBLETEA OMG!  

They open at 8:00AM for breakfast so I told Spencer about it and we decided to hit up Bubblemania on a Sunday.  We arrived about 12:30pm (Yeah I know..not breakfast time...brunch?!) There was plenty of parking, it wasn't busy at all.  Perfect!  So we got greeted and sat right off the bat.  We were handed a 8 1/2 x 14 peice of paper which was the breakfast menu.  I was so excited to see what they offered! .........

-_-'....My excited smile slowly turned into a wtf?! look.  They offered eggs with bacon, SPAM, potatoes and rice.  I recall reading something about miso BUT I didn't get what they meant by \"asian fusion\" because everything looked like you can order it at Denny's but with a different name.  Maybe they thought since there an option to put rice as a side, they'd call it asian fusion. *sigh* DISAPPOINTMENT!  

Spence and I look at eachother, \"Umm...nothing looks good\"... I thought maybe we can ask for the regular menu because it was already after noon so when the lady was walking past, I asked her if we could have the lunch menu. \"Umm..sorry no, we only offer breakfast for now until 2pm, and we resume with the regular menu at 5pm.\" 

We told her that we'd come back for the regular menu, but never returned.  I took 2 stars off from my original review because I just don't get what they're trying to do... Things have been inconsistent, even the hours.  I'm divorcing Bubblemania and sticking with Thai Tai!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great atmosphere and food.  The best bubble tea in town.  The chicken wings are also the bomb.com and service is quick."}
{"text":"Review: dinner.

Bubblemania has always been a staple in Calgary as one of the first cafes to offer BBT. It's always been our go to place for a BBT night out. It's been around for ages and there's been lots of changes. Unfortunately, the changes are not for the better.

Bottomline: this cafe has gone downhill over the last little while. It's often sold out of certain items and their staple wings have worsened on both quality and taste. No longer the go to place for BBT.

Atmosphere: depending on the time of day, this cafe would fill to capacity and get very loud. Conversations often turn to yelling contests. Decor is somewhat modern but feels like nothing comes together as a whole. Service is good and fast.

Food: mango avacado bbt has always been my favorite. In fact, I got my co-workers hooked onto that stuff. But sadly, they were out of avacados. So I asked for the pink guava. Out. Nectarine. Out. At this point, if I was batting in baseball I'd strike out. Finally I settled on white peach, which the server had to check to make sure they had it in stock. And this has happened numerous times during previous visits over the last several months.

The wings used to be awesome, but today they were just average. They were still fried well, but  sizes were inconsistent, some bones were broken, and spices/sauces were spread very unevenly. We also ordered the house fried rice as well to \"balance our diet.\" It had a pretty good flavor but was just a tad bit too greasy.

Value: Average comparing to other BBT places.

Bubblemania has disappointed me one too many times. I will not be heading back."}
{"text":"Love bubble tea but one afternoon when we went in and there was no one there we sat down with three people. Two of us were just going to have bubble tea but my wife had some dietary restrictions because of health so wasn't going to order. We were told that everyone had to order and that the bill had to come to more than 20 dollars. So we left. I've popped in for a bubble tea here and there and they are pretty tasty, but that experience left me feeling a little off."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bubble tea place in the city. We go at least four times a month. The bubble tea is amazing. Service is great. And the food is good! Only thing I could ask for now is some pho!"}
{"text":"Second time going to this place in one month. Love the wings and the drinks. Favorite Slush is Sweet Dream. The milk teas are also amazing. The staff is really quick with bringing out orders. And love the layout of the restaurant, its unique."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy Asian cafes because one, I love bubbletea and two, I love curry fish balls. And the foods pretty good, prices are reasonable and the staff work hard to please you. Do expect crying babies and loud teenagers when you're here."}
{"text":"This place is not bad... The bubble tea is really good, and all other appetizers are ok... Is not fancy at all... But the ambience is ok, and the place inexpensive.. Maybe I will go back If I am driving around the area and want to have a bubble tea of different flavors..."}
{"text":"My  hubby and I wanted cheap wings on a Saturday night and Bubblemania popped into my brain.  I have ordered bubble teas from there before, but had never dined in, I had never tried the food. The tea was always yummy!  I remember looking at their website and saw that they had wings! So during a snowstorm we drove to bubblemania.  Considering the bad weather it was pretty busy in there.  Lots of Asian people, but who doesn't love being surrounded by Asians? :)

Anyways, we decided to order bubble teas, my hubby, basically a bubble tea virgin, ordered a flavour that he didn't like and the server noticed and switched it for him for no charge (he had only taken one sip). That was sweet of her! So we ordered 20 wings, 10 salt and pepper and 10 HOT. They were piping hot and yummy, the HOT wings were too spicy and saucy for me, but my hubby liked them. They were 38 cents/wing, a great deal.  Our bill came to about $18 which was awesome. We would go back for sure to try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"First time coming here to a bubble tea drink. It had a lively atmosphere consisting mostly of younger crowd with some tables where parents came with their kids. I got a hot mocha bubble tea with tapioca. They place tapioca on the side so you can add it in as you deserve - they were made well, tasty. The drink felt more like hot chocolate than mocha - though it still tasted good. I believe we ordered the Spicy Honey wings - they were great. It seemed quite a lot of the customers ordered the fried rice - looks pretty good, will try it next time. Overall, it's a great place to get together with friends or go on a date with your partner. The service was quick and the staff were friendly. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Tonight I went there to get takeout bubble tea for myself and 6 friends. When I went in, there was a strong humid smell in the restaurant, nobody greeted me. There were people seated left and right, and multiple lines, there didn't seem to be much of an order. I understand it can get busy, so this does not affect my score. I walked up to the counter, looked at the laminated menus provided and chose the bubble teas I wanted. I told the girl at the front desk that I would like to order take out, she says 'okay' and leaves the counter. I believe she was a server or busser because she never came back. Eventually a crowd of people who needed to pay bills for their table and more people waiting to order take out lined up around the counter. The busser came back and started taking payments of these people, I asked her, 'Is this where I order take out?' she replied, 'Yes but you have to wait until these people pay.' Well uh, I proceeded to wait 15 more minutes on a Tuesday evening (not busy) before I had enough and just left. Not even going to try again."}
{"text":"We went at rush hour in Calgary in the middle of the week and so there really weren't too many people there. They did play very current music but contrary to some of the reviews I wouldn't say it was overbearingly loud. I've never been to a bubble tea restaurant, as I'm from the states and my only experience has been with bubble tea and a cafe style selection of food. I absolutely loved the selection at Bubblemania! I had a really hard time deciding not only what drink to order but also what dish! There were a lot of unique things on the menu that id never heard of before, and I definitely vow to try the flowering teapot selection next time we visit. I forget the name of the bubble tea I ordered but it had banana, chocolate and strawberry in it and was excellent, extremely flavorful. I also like that the tapioca pearls are served on the side so you choose how many goes in your glass. My boyfriend ordered a large bowl of pho and I had the Hawaiian chicken fried rice. It came out very quickly, our waitress was nice and attentive. Huge portions, and tasted excellent. The only thing I would suggest is maybe moving into a larger or second location. There are A LOT of tables in here and it seems like it would be pretty tight if a person went when it's busy. Overall I really enjoyed coming here and will mark it in my yelp book of favorites."}
{"text":"The food is great. But today they ran out of pop. The waiter tells us that AFTER he asks what we want to drink. So then we place our food order. We order 4 orders of wings and approx. 8 other dishes. He then comes back to say that their house rules are that EVERYONE at the table has to order a drink when you order wings. How can we do that when they ran out of pop?!??!!! So the only other alternative is bubble tea which cost more than pop?!! There were 10 of us. 4 orders of wings and everyone must order a drink?!! This is the utmost dumbest \"house rule\" I've ever heard especially when they can't even serve you pop. What a joke!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lively here. This place is filled with teenagers/ young adults, likewise, most of the staff are young adults. As someone around that age group, this is basically where all my friends go to enjoy a nice drink and snack (wings). 

Staff were friendly and checked up on you every so often to may sure everything was ok. I can't say much about the other food, but of the food that I did try (wings), they are very good... but have since gotten smaller compared to when I first came here. As for the drinks, the bubble tea is pretty good, they have a nice selection (but nothing I would go crazy for).  

As for parking, its gonna be pretty hard to find :P. 

Overall, my experience here has been great. Definitely a place I would go back to every so often."}
{"text":"Parking 4/5 parking lot is very small and always full you have a better can't rod finding parking on the street behind the building 

Food 5/5 great wing, bubble tea! 

Service 5/5 the hostess said it would take 20'mins because the place was packed but we were able to get a table in 10 mins. Our waitress was alexia and she was awesome. Super friendly and attentive ! 

Environment 4/5 the place is fairly big, it was super packed but we went the day before Canada day so expected it to be busy. It was a little dark inside could use a little bit more lighting."}
{"text":"I was invited here for wings, typically not my type of place but I was with a group of friends and this is where they wanted to go.

Service was slow, but they did have a huge selection of beverages and almost all tables were having wings.

We placed our wing  and drink order and this is why I am giving them only two stars... The non Asian tables, ours, only got served the wing with the tip portion.  We got ZERO drumettes. Since service was so slow we didn't complain.  We paid our bill and left and on the way out we noticed a nice huge fresh batch of drumettes being served to a table of younger Asians.  
 
Not cool Bubblemainia, not cool."}
{"text":"This is a good review, I like Bubblemania!
HOWEVER, I must comment that in my opinion it was a much cooler joint an about 2006 and prior. They had black and white homemade checkered tabletops made out of floor tiles, a rack of free to read Asian car and fashion magazines, and you could smoke your face off. More of a \"hang out\" than just another restaurant if you know what I mean.

These days (2011) Bubblemania has been totally made over and is all fancy clean and nice. There are 10000000001 weird but all delicious non-alcoholic drinks bubble teas etc etc etc. Plus theres cheap chicken wings and other well priced good quality food items.

98% of the customers are 16 - 25 year old well dressed trendy South East Asians. If this bothers you, dont go. Personally I get a kick out of being the only white guy in the room, and neither the customers nor the staff make any notice of you good or bad because of your ethnicity (the way it should be). 

The staff are mostly friendly, but always quick and accurate. On weekend evenings there may be a lineup out the door, so this should indicate to you they're doing something right!! :)  Also on weekend evenings you can most likely check out all the tricked out Asian sports cars parked out front, sometimes there are more than a dozen with obvious money and effort put into them. It's like a free car show if you like these \"tuner\"cars.

I would overall highly recommend Bubblemania, you can bring kids, its good quality, its good service, generally pretty damn good joint. Its dimly lit inside in a good way, and this place would totally be suitable as a \"date\" venue.  At times it can be loud, with all the hustle and bustle and people chatting, but its all GOOD creating an exciting fun atmosphere.  Kinda like a sideways weird \"bar\" in some ways, you just have to go there to experience it yourself :) I would actually RECOMMEND that if you have never been, to deliberately go on a busy friday evening to get the full fun and effect.

OH YEAH, the music WILL be \"techno\" computer asian style stuff, but they dont play it so loud you cant ignore it if you hate it, AND Bubblemania is well known for being open LATE especially on weekends!"}
{"text":"To say I am a fan of Bubbles (as us frequent goers call it) would be an understatement. This has been my friends and my choice for bubbletea since the beginning of our driving days (that was 7 years ago - yes I am old!) Unlike other bubbletea places, Bubbles is open late and offers a great variety of food and unique drinks until the wee hours of the morning. It's a great setting for a first date - although it can get quite loud on certain nights; girls night - nothing provokes gossip better than some wings and lychee jelly; a time filler between events - the quick service on non prime hours are superb; basically I would recommend this place for any casual get together. 

The prices, although a bit higher than other bubbletea places, is well worth the experience. Unlike most conventional bubbletea places, Bubbles offer a large selection of uniquely created drinks with equally unique names. It is the only place I can ever go and order a \"Lonely\" which is passion fruit and lychee flavored slush topped with vanilla ice cream. Yum! The atmosphere is welcoming and the decor, trendy; although the chairs are more esthetically pleasing than comfy. Might I also recommend, a booth?  

Rather than wing night, Bubbles offers Happy Hour specials - 25 cent wings before 9 PM. They offer the typical flavors - salt and pepper, honey garlic, hot, super hot but the drool worthy flavor and my all time fave: spicy honey. It's a combination of honey garlic and hot. Yet another original creation that keeps my friends and I coming back for more. 

A few more of my faves: 
BBT wise - Jade, the aforementioned Lonely, taro milk tea, black sesame taro slush
Snack wise - wings, chicken karaage, spicy chicken udon

After 7 long years of patronage, you can still find my friends and I there, almost every Thursday night. Yes, we will be among the mass of other Asians; talking loudly. Feel free to wave!"}
