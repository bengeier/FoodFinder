{"text":"Went here last week with a co-worker, I had the Hot Shrimp Roti, she had the Medium Hot Chicken Roti, both were awesome. Great value 2 for $7. Very tasty, parking is tough in that plaza but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This is the ideal resturant for some typical Trinidadian/West Indian food.  The folks are cool and the food is delicious.  They are famous for their Roti's hence the name.  The price is similiar to that of the competitors.  Each time we come in here the owners always greets us - like they know who their customers.  I've been going here for the past 7 years and I enjoy it.  Check out their Saturday/Sunday breakfast buffet, very appetizing."}
{"text":"OK folks this here is a hidden joint! It seems to be a mom & pop shop and is best for grab and go.   The food here was delicious! I ordered their Jerk chicken with rices and peas plus potatoes on the side... The good was warm, yummy, easy on the pocket, good portion size. The chicken was cooked well and was quite tender.   The service was quick and we were in and out in no time. Over all very good experience.  To my Muslim Bro & Sis - The meet is halal here. They have a halal sign on the door and I saw a certificate inside as well."}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the price and service. Friendly workers and not a long wait. I got the small chicken roti which was really good. i got it without the bones and the portion and size of the roti was bigger then i thought. Parking might be a issue"}
{"text":"I got the medium size curry beef with rice and string beans (medium pepper), it was pretty good. they could really use a new ordering system, the cashier has to write everything down on the box, I would hate to be there during there busy time."}
{"text":"So delicious. I had the curry beef roti and wish I had ordered two. I got a small it was around $7. Will Definitely be going back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"If a place is called ROTI ROTI its prime dish (beign Roti) should be delicious, adn in this case- IT IS! * So one star for NAILING their Specialty dish. * One star for AMAZING PRICING. (Tues-Thurs 2 for $7.00) Yes thats $3.33/ per Roti!!!! * One star for originality- They are REALLY carribean!  Minus a star for the doubles- I was looking forward to it and it smelled and tasted like old oil.  Minus a star for the ambiance of the restaurant- it looked too busy and cluttered. Even though they ahd a place to sit and eat I was not enticed to do so.  Overall, next time I crave Roti done right I'm coming here!"}
{"text":"Best dish boneless curry chicken, bus up shot."}
{"text":"Great roti shop the food is always good.  Even my barber suggested this place to grab roti. Goat roti was awesome!!!! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best roti spot I've been to in Toronto. Authentic feel, quality food, fair prices and excellent lunch special options. Nice family-run spot with friendly service and fresh tasty food. Their doubles are unbelievable and their signature jerk chicken is a nice alternative to a traditional favourite. Their hot chutney is some of the most flavourful hot sauce I've ever eaten. Gotta stop in weekly."}
{"text":"So... this has got to be the WORST roti and doubles that I have ever eaten in my entire life (and I have consumed more than my fair share of Trini food).  I ordered a chicken roti and a few doubles.  The roti (dhal puri) shell was chewy, glutinous and there were barely any split pea filling in it. The meat was not seasoned at all and tasted and looked like it was rotisserie chicken rather than curry chicken. The dough on the doubles was paper thin and gummy in texture and there were hardly any chickpeas between the limp dough. The doubles lacked flavor and its usual vibrant yellow colour. It was bland and boring - it also was definitely hurting for seasoning.  Trinidad food is supposed to encompass a savory, intricate blend of spices that awaken every taste bud.  But the food from Roti Roti contradicted this culinary doctrine.   I am extremely disappointed in the lack of quality and embarrassed that Roti Roti declares that they have an inspired menu.  My question is, Roti Roti Restaurant - who inspired you? Unquestionably dissatisfied."}
{"text":"We went for a take-out lunch of goat, jerk chicken an beef rotis.  Good food at excellent prices.  Lots of locals come in for lunch which says lots about the place.  The decor is a little wanting but the food is very good."}
{"text":"So we came to visit Toronto which was the first trip for many of my family members.  We decided to get some doubles for breakfast so I looked this place up on Yelp and boy were we happy.  The guy behind the counter greeted us with a smile and made us our food in increments which was good for us bc it allowed us to start munchin' a little while the rest of the stuff got there.  The customer service was good, the pricing was fair and the only thing that stopped me from what I believed to be \"5 - Stars\" was the fact that he said they didn't take credit cards from the States.  That was kind of weird bc credit cards are credit cards, I didn't think being from the States made a difference."}
{"text":"We usually go to Drupati's but I'd read the doubles were good here so we wanted to try it out. First, the atmosphere is not as good as Drupati's. It's older and it smells very strongly of curry. They need better ventilation. I don't want to go somewhere and leave smelling of curry. The curry itself is a bit better than Drupati's, but the dhalpuri can not touch that of Drupati's. They both suffer from comparisons being so close to each other. The prices are a bit better at Roti Roti. The doubles were ok, but nothing touches the doubles at ACR Roti in Scarborough. Best I've had outside of Trinidad. The doubles here were ok, but nobody seems to add shado beni like they do at ACR. It's a downside for me. Overall this place is ok, but with Drupati's being next door I don't think I'd return to Roti Roti."}
