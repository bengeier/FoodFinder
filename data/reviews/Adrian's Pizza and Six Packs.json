{"text":"Always satisfied with Adrians. Had a problem 1 time and the owner resolved it immediately. The food is always very hot and delicious. They have the fastest delivery drivers also. They even spelled out the number 18 in pepperoni on the pizza for my son's birthday! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Just got a gyro wedge and first off,  the Italian dressing was spilled and went all over my husband and his car,  then once we ate it there was literally NO meat on it... it was just cheese,  lettuce,  and bread with three tomatoes.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Adrian's Pizza is a good spot. Food is always good, service on the weekends can be a little slow, but they tell you that going in. People that work there, a lot of young ones, are always very friendly and courteous. 6 pack and a steak hoagie delivered? Yes!"}
{"text":"Tonight it took over an hour without any offer from them provide a discount for inconvenience. Had to call them and ask where are you? Food is good but they really need work on the customer service side."}
{"text":"I'm new to this area so we tried it and I though I was having frozen Jeno's pizza....  The worst!"}
{"text":"We eat here weekly for some years now. Today was the last time. We ordered a cheese pizza because my daughter is a vegetarian. When I got back with that and the other things we ordered I found that it had pepperoni on it. I called and my wife went to get the replacement. When she got there Frank the owner asked where the other pizza was. We were not told to bring it  back. He said I thought that was just common sense. She asked who he was and he replied I am Frank Mazzata the fucking owner. Needless to say my wife had words with him. I called to \"discuss\" this with The asshole who would speak to my wife this way but instead was told he was too busy. The woman said my wife had an attitude. Here's the thing. On another review on yelp it was said they take back food given out to resell to others. Have any of you ever been asked to return food that was done incorrectly? No they cannot resell food once it leaves. Apparently Frank does and that is why he got so upset over a 10.00 mistake they made that we had to drive there and back twice for. Frank you are a true POS who doesn't know anything about customer service. F you and your reused pizza. It was our inconvenience not yours bitch."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend suggested this place because it was associated with Mazzotta Winery. We had a wine tasting, which will be in another post and decided to purchase a bottle to take downstairs to the pizza shop for dinner. It was an excellent bottle of wine to complement a great Spinach & Chicken Pizza. White sauce, grilled chicken, bacon, spinach, tomato and chesses make this a excellent choice for a dinner pizza with wine and a side house salad. Service was friendly and quick. We sat in front of the window on a sunny evening and enjoyed our dinner. Highly recommend, eating in. The dining room is large enough to accommodate any size party. I know that she has returned several times with family and friends. We are planning another pizza dinner there soon."}
{"text":"Honestly- save your money!! This place is the worst. We ordered a salad, a hoagie and an order of cheese fries- the kid on the phone repeated back and confirmed our order. Our order came to $23.00 and we paid in advance with our card. An hour later our food was delivered minus the hoagie and fries. They did however include some gross cheese sticks that we did not order. When I called the kid on the phone said they messed up the order and he would talk to the manager- he then got back on and proceeded to tell me that it was our fault because the order was repeated back to me and I didn't listen. This is not the first time our order has been wrong but I rarely complain. So the $23.00 salad and terrible customer service is enough to say never ever again!!!"}
{"text":"We feel so lucky to live so close to Adrian's Pizza!  We have been getting their pizza very timely delivered for a few years now and are always wanting more!  The dough is delicious and fresh and their sauce and cheese is perfection.  We highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place gets so many bad reviews. Maybe people had one bad experience but hey, nobody's perfect. We ordered the pterodactyl, a pepperoni pizza, and breadsticks. The food was delicious. And that's saying a lot because I was accidentally 1 hour late to pick up my order. And it was still pretty damn good! Much better than other local pizza places. I'll definitely order again."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. They are a pizza restaurant, and have a very strong menu. Very good food. Nice friendly folks at the counter. What is unusual is an incredible selection of foreign and domestic craft beers. They also have what you would expect. Very solid choice, nice family environment. Will definitely be back."}
