{"text":"This place is really tasty! i had the shrimp po boy, loved the roumalaude sauce that was on it and the bread was really DELICIOUS. The sweet potatoe fries were perfect. Next time i want to order my fish and have them cook it up with some sides. Definitly get Ben to be your server if you wanted an open ticket. He really makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I ordered a crab salad today for lunch and for the first time in my 60 years I was served spoiled food. The salad had roasted tomatoes and egg on it so I hadn't smelled anything strange. The first bite of crab tasted like it had heavy pepper on it. My husband tasted it and spit it out and there was a strong ammonia odor on his fingers that nothing could wash away. They admitted it was spoiled and said \" don't worry you won't have to pay for this we are sorry\" Why would I expect to pay for something that was spoiled  ( and I might get ill from) and I didn't eat any more... obviously. So that was their solution??? They knew we've been customers of their take out meats, which were always fine. The reason for this yelp is because they obviously need to learn better business savvy. The manager and owner didn't even think to come out and speak to us as well as they should have comped my husbands Salmon. Our lunch was ruined. I never ate at all and after we left my husband became sick to his stomach because of the ammonia odor still on his fingers. The owners are either not business savvy or cowards. whichever, read and learn."}
{"text":"This place is plain AWFUL! If I could give a 0 or negative star review I would! According to some of the reviews it is all fresh! Let it be known that this is an out and out LIE! (I am not calling the reviewers liars, I believe the owners are misleading the public)
From the market it is fresh from the grille it is NOT! Furthermore, I found it extremely unprofessional to talk about the staff in the manner they do. I believe that there is a reason there is new staff daily! Paul seems like a nice enough guy, but the other seemed a little off (like a used car dealer trying to put one over on you). 

We ordered fish n chips... Soggy in the middle and looked watery but I did like the beer batter! Malt aioli was good as well. It was just so apparent that the fish was frozen previously. I also ordered an overprice soup ... it was COLD! 

Could not believe the wait times and I think counter service in this area is not ideal or what we are looking for. Numerous people walked out when I was there the other day. I will not be returning! I am so disappointed that this did not meet my expectations or just follow through with the concept of being fresh! [seriously who uses frozen and says its fresh] But if you can overlook all of that and hope they get fresh fish go for the beer batter if not anything else."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for this restaurant/market to open.  VERY disappointed.  Portions were very small and temperature was not hot.  Soup was warm.  French fries were cold.  Would not return.
Their market of fish was very nice but AJ's Seafood Department has nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"im so excited that this has opened.  I've picked up fish from the market twice and took it home.  It was amazing.  They even suggested some options on cooking.  I've eaten in the restaurant three times.  Quite frankly the service left a lot to be desired, however I ate their today and they've seemed to work out the kinks.  I had halibut tonight and a cup of the crab chowder.  The halibut was delicious and a bargain at $18. The crab chowder was the best I've ever had.  Lots of crab and topped off with bacon crumbs.  I'm thrilled that Wild Ocean has a home in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's a real joy to have a high quality seafood restaurant and market located nearby. I have been a regular customer of the seafood market and finally found a high quality alternative to pricy groceries also in the neighborhood. The Turbot and Grouper are both a refreshing treat and the management is also most helpful."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would give this less than 4 stars. In going 5! Very tasty very fresh generous portions. Seafood Chowder to start was perfect not need to add anything, perfect temp and huge. I'm 6'9\" I weight 285 I can eat the bowl almost filled me up. Full of seafood and only $10, easily could charge 15-17 bucks for a bowl this big and full of seafood. Shrimp Salad sandwich was equally as tasty. I prefer more mayo but that's just me. The toasted bun was perfect. I could not ask for a fresher lunch even if I caught it myself. Kudos and well done! I will be back and back and back..... Great relaxed atmosphere high quality food cooked to order...... Winner!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips were tough..too much batter and very little fish....very dissointing as I was looking forward to a good seafood restaurant near our home on d c ranch..."}
{"text":"The setting is akin to that of a cafeteria. The tables & chairs are rudimentary, and the silvers are still relatively new since they haven't been opened for that long.

The staff tries so hard to please the diners and often comes to check.  I was with a party of 4, it took approximately 50 minutes of waiting before being seated.  They don't take reservations. 

The sea food is fresh but the taste is bland and had no flavors. The wine selection is good to excellent.

Bottom Line:  Either price has to come down to meet the ambiance of cafeteria, or have to upgrade the atmosphere to command $42.00 per person billing."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night and our party had a wide array of menu items. Everything was great. Will be back to eat here as well as buy market seafood to prepare at home."}
{"text":"I came for lunch. Moderately busy at about 1 pm on a Wed. I had the sweet and spicy carimari. The portion size had grown since my last visit. It still is my favorite app. Really wonderful flavor. Today I had a filet of sea bass. Fingerling potatoes and asparagus. Perfectly cooked fish and veg. Lite and do delicious. My last busy was during a rush time and coming when they are not so busy seems to be better. Time will tell. Really amazing lunch."}
{"text":"Upon entering, you're immediately besieged with the heavenly aroma of fresh fish, reminiscent of a fine bayside restaurant. This, as your attention is drawn to the long glass showcase of fresh seafood.

The restaurant is another story.
I won't go into too much detail but will say it needs some work. 

The owners, whom I understand have never been in the restaurant business would do well to hire a strong executive chef - someone who knows how risotto should be creamy and fluffy, not dry and heaped into a lump. Or how the temperature of the fish should at the very least be lukewarm. Some of the other issues can be found in the other low star count reviews.

They're not that far off the mark, but I suspect if they don't get some of these issues fixed before the tourist season ends, they could become another statistic by late summer.
I'd hate to see this since they do have an above average seafood market selection.

Step up your game guys and you'll have a year-round customer for life."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new seafood market/restaurant hoping for an alternative fresh seafood restaurant.  We were sorely disappointed.  The food was mediocre at best with service being very, very lacking.  While the staff was pleasant, we ordered soon after sitting but had to wait forever for our food to be delivered.  The tuna, ordered medium/rare, was very overdone and had to be sent back.  The fish and chips was all batter.  The accompanying cole slaw was tasteless and fries were old, soggy and cold.  Most items were marked \"market price\" and the staff could not tell you the price - rather it all depended on how big a piece was ordered or how many scallops were ordered and then all marked up $9 for \"chef preparation\".  Very strange, though ultimately high pricing.  When we voiced our concerns about the timing and quality, the waitress did not seem surprised and said they did have some things to work out!  Then, they trotted out an unwanted piece of key lime pie which we left on the table.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"What a difference one month makes in the life of a restaurant. We ate at Wild Ocean last month and found the food to be good and the service good. Abit pricy but hard to find good seafood in the desert. We ate at Wild Ocean a few nights ago and found the prices had been increased on everything. The service was terrible and the restaurant was half empty. The party behind us also had service problems. It should not take over twenty minutes for bowls of soup to be served. Based on our first vist we recommended the restaurant to many friends. No more."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and it shall be the last.  Had the fish n chips, cooked but not hot and charged more for the item than stated in the menu.  Also once the transaction posted to my account found  it was $3.46 more than we had signed for.  (Tip was included.)  Lots of improving to be done on many levels."}
{"text":"Came here on an early Friday night with a family group. It was empty and seated right away. As it filled up it became extremely loud and could not hear the person sitting       across from you or even next to you. Our server was very nice, but it appeared she was waiting on several tables . Among the dishes ordered were fish n`chips, lobster rolls , clam chowder and crab louie salad. The clam chowder was good as were the lobster rolls. the fish n chips was really disappointing. Only got one small fish strip and it was heavily battered. The French fries were a soggy lump and the cole slaw was a glob of tasteless cabbage. Overall the food was not especially tasty -maybe because it was very busy or there was kitchen problems. Our server did her best for us. Due to the disappointing food and the extreme noise it is unlikely we will return to this restaurant. Maybe in a couple months they will improve and also put up some shade screens to block the afternoon sun that makes it impossible to sit at some of the tables."}
{"text":"A lot of my rating has to do with the fact that it's so nice to have an alternative to all the steakhouses in the area and the ability to by fresh seafood without having to go all the way down to Whole Foods. The \"restaurant\" side needs some work.  We walked in around 4:30 and the seating area which is relatively small, was mostly empty, but just about everyone of them had a reserved sign on it.  Supposedly, we got the only available table for 2.  Anyway, the waitstaff could use more training.  We waited at least 10 mins. before the waitress came over to ask if we wanted anything to drink.  She was friendly enough, but seemed unsure about how some things could or could not be cooked.  After a few more minutes, she brought out some focaccia bread with an olive oil balsamic dip.  Nice touch, but the bread was cold .... like it was taken out of the fridge just moments before slicing and serving.  It should have been put in an oven to warm a bit or at least allowed to come to room temperature. I had the lobster roll and my husband had the clam chowder and fish and chips.  The lobster roll was good, but not a true New England lobster roll.  The roll was lacking in seasoning, mayo and a very buttery roll.   There was plenty of lobster meat, but it wasn't very sweet and hence, needed additional seasoning. My husband liked his clam chowder, but I thought it was too thin and gritty from the potatoes.  The fish and chips were nicely battered and fried, but also lacked seasoning. The fries that came with both dishes were also good.  However, back to the service.  I am unsure if it's the kitchen or the waitstaff.  The food came out fairly quickly, so it's a little baffling, but nothing was \"piping hot\".  It was all just warm enough to be acceptable .... if that makes any sense.  Most of the time, fried foods require that you wait a bit before you bite into them, but we dove right in. There were probably 2 waitress and a hostess on duty and though there were only about 6 tables occupied, they seemed to have a hard time keeping up. Once we handed the waitress our credit card, she was at the register for a good 10 minutes before finally enlisting the help of someone else.  All in all, the food was good enough that we will be back (although I would probably not order the lobster roll again) because we like that there's a nice selection of seafood and will definitely be back to purchase seafood to cook at home."}
{"text":"Kitchen food still the same and they  haven't seemed to work the kinks out yet since opening but I guess they are trying..its been over a month though. Hmm and where are all the workers that were there two weeks ago...and they still have service that dony know whats going on..so sad

 Really disappointed in the long ticket trimes and how the food comes out different everytime. but I guess they are trying. I wish them the best but I think its a bit far for what I get and I hope that they are successful. I wont be going back..lots of money spent and really didn't seem to be anything special."}
{"text":"It was good. Food was great but service was slow. I know it is new so I am only taking one start away for the service."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this new restaurant tonight. It's a welcome addition as we live less than a mile away.   The restaurant/store has the makings of being OK after they sort out the kinks pointed out by other reviewers.  (The staff are willing, but our main courses arrived before they had cleared away our starters.)

We loved the mussels and liked the clam chowder.  The lobster roll was OK.  The mahi mahi sandwich had good ingredients but the bun was cold and the fish was only lukewarm.  The wine by the glass was a generous pour and not overpriced by Scottsdale standards.

We mentioned to the owner that the restaurant would benefit from lower lighting in the evening.  It felt a little like being in a Chinese restaurant with bright spotlights - not what you would expect when presented with a bill of $80 for two before tip and tax."}
{"text":"Tried to call to place a to go order for lobster roll one day last week. Rang and rang and eventually went to phone mail. Tried 3 times with the same result.  I live close so decided just to drive over. 
Surprise!! Parking spaces in front were blocked by white cones and being used by Maestos for valet. Place looked dark and empty and there was a sign in the front door so I got out and read it. 
It says they are closed for remodeling and will reopen early July.  

Would have been nice if they put that on their phone message and saved me a drive. 

Sign said to check their website for updates.  But the website has no content at all. It just says business under construction.
 
So big mystery.  We wil see."}
{"text":"As a East Coast transplant with a husband from New England we are always looking for lobstah and chowder!  This place misses the mark.  Fish and chips were very bland. Lobster roll was on a large garlic laden roll.  Lobster should be the centerpiece, and it was lost in the roll.  New England clam chowder was not thick and full of so much bacon it more resembled split pea and ham soup.  Seafood display looked fresh, and the place was clean.  Not returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came for the fresh, wild caught fish and fell in love! Let's talk about the food. From selecting your own piece, cooked your way, add two sides, wine if you like. The venue is casual, with pictures of fish on the walls all around you. Almost feel like I'm at the ocean. Service attentive and friendly. Family, locally owned. What a find. Great fish, perfectly cooked, if you crave fish, but want  affordable prices,this is your place!
Ps chicken and beef looks great too.."}
{"text":"This eat-in seafood market is just what North Scottsdale has been needing!   They offer a wonderful wide variety of fresh raw seafood for purchase as well as a great menu for casual dining.  The fish and chips and calamari was my choice today and it was great!   I highly recommend this great establishment!"}
{"text":"Went April 3rd 2015 arrived @710 left @915 (running). Full house. 11 mins to be seated. This is our 2nd time here.  Our server was new and friendly. And was trying hard to do his job. But when the kitchen is cooking only was dish at a time. Forget get about food being hot and served within a timely matter. The fish itself is excellent. and that's the end of it. The owner is a waste of oxygen. It's clearly a family is running the front of house. Their lack of experience clearly shows. Except the two guys behind the fish counter. The red head and the old Fishman they saw what was happening and tried to help. And watching the owner use big red to vet customer complaints before coming to the table to say sorry 5 times without taking responsibility. Is I guess normal.. I wish them good luck. But they have a lot to fix. I will not return. 2 stars for fresh fish."}
{"text":"It seem that if you want to make a reservation for tonight, you can't get through to Wild Ocean Seafood.  Their message said to leave a message and we will get back to you the next today! You got to wonder what type of operation they run if you can't get through to make a reservation."}
