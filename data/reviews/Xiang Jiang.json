{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Chinese take out restaurants since their food is usually... well for a lack of better words \"crap.\" But Xiang Jiang wasnt that bad! Their prices are really cheap and the food is pretty good! I love their crab rangoons and  their peppered steak w. onions! Yumm!! I go there atleast 2-3 times a month because their food keeps me coming back for more! So happy Cottage Grove has a Chinese take out place nearby!"}
{"text":"Great food, reliable quality, decent prices and they'll deliver. I recommend it."}
{"text":"This is pretty good for what it is - cheap Chinese takeout.  It's not gourmet stuff, but the quality is consistently good, and if you're in the mood for a decent, filling Chinese meal, you can't go too wrong here.    They have a dining room, but I've never seen anyone eating in it."}
{"text":"I ordered a combination fried rice only to find out that the rice was only halfway cooked through. I wasn't expecting much by stopping here, but I'd  appreciate it if they at least showed some effort towards food."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly down-to-business kind of Chinese takeout joint. I ordered two egg rolls and chicken lo mein--huge! came with pork fried rice (didn't even know). Plenty of food--I can probably eat the rest for a very filling dinner. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We love this place, it's best known for fast take out. The food is usually ready in 15 minutes or less. We've never been disappointed. Egg rolls are always hot and crispy, and they have a very extensive menu. Customer service is great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I struggle with finding good Chinese food.  This place hit the spot!  This was my first visit here but was very happy.  Crab rangoon are my favorite and this place did not disappoint.  They were filled nicely and had good flavor.  The szechuan chicken was really good.  Chicken was white meat and not \"grizzley\".  The vegetables seemed fresh and tasty.  I will go here again.  It definitely kicks China Inn on CG road's a$$."}
{"text":"Ordered lo mien and chicken teriyaki and it was very bad. Chicken had a rubbery texture and lo mien tasted old. We have ordered the same things from a Madison Xiang Jiang location and were happy with the food, however, we were not able to eat the food we paid for here because it was so bad."}
{"text":"Decent fast food Chinese. People are always nice and get food to you quick. I like the chow mei fun the best"}
{"text":"Very good food for a reasonable price. Seems to be a family run business and the people that work there are always extremely kind. They do accommodate dinning in but are best known for their excellent carry out in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food that we have had in a very long time. Their food here was AMAZING and DELICIOUS!! I recommend the Honey Chicken"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time and all I can say positively  is that the food was edible. Besides that the service given could be 100x improved and the quality of the food aswell. Also sanitation is a huge one with this restaurant that needs alot of improvement  since I seen all the cooks grabbing rice, noodles etc  with their bare hands very disgusting. The restaurant had a bad porter potty smell that lingered with the food that through me off a bit. Overall not the best experience."}
{"text":"The best Chinese meal I have had since moving to the Midwest. Very much like like the Chinese places back in New Jersey."}
