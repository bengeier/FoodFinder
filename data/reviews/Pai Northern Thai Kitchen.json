{"text":"1. Grabong ($10): Deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip
- I really like this as an appetizer. The tangy dip complements the sweet squash well.

2. Gaeng Kiaw Wan in a coconut ($15): Green curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk. Served in a coconut with rice. Choice of: chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, fish, tofu or veggies.
- Lots of meat in the curry. Good for sharing.

3. Khao Pla Tawt ($14): Crispy basa fillet with oyster sauce, crispy shallots served with 2 sauces: fresh chilli sauce and tangy tamarind sauce
- I loved this because the fish was crispy the entire time and it wasn't greasy.

4. Khao Soi with beef ($14): Fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander and green onions. Choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks
- Consistently good dish from Chef Nuit. The golden curry is flavourful and rich but not heavy. Braised beef was tender. 

5. Papaya salad - salted crab ($10): Shredded green papaya, tomato, long green beans, garlic, red chilli, tamarind juice, fish sauce, coconut sugar and freshly squeezed lime
- The salted crab tasted like sashimi and though the claws were small, they were very salted which balanced out the rest of the salad. 

6. I Moo Ping ($10): Northern Thai Street Grilled Pork on a skewer
- 3 skewers"}
{"text":"I was on the phone trying to order with Khao San Road for over 30 mins calling back over and over again. No one picked up. Called here they picked up on the third ring took my order and had it ready in 15mins with a smile on their faces. 

^ that is service worth  great job! 

Will defiantly be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, and spectacular value overall. The only drawback is that it often has a wait time and I feel it always takes a while to get our food. As a result, I don't go nearly as often as I'd like. If you're not in a rush and looking for some great Thai food, look no further."}

The Tamarin curry is exquisite and a culinary perfection. Their fried squash appetizer is a great meal to share and is full of flavour. The food came out quick and the servers were very generous. I liked the unique posters and paintings scattered around the restaurant for the decor. I live an hour away from this restaurant and I still drive the distance because of the top notch quality of the food."}
{"text":"Really wonderful spot. Delicious, flavourful, authentic Thai food. The decor is unique and fun and service was great, too. I've been numerous times and have always enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Came for a work lunch and had a great time! Really cool atmosphere/decor and very friendly staff. We tried the spring rolls, the chicken pad thai, the pad gra prow and the green curry and none of them disappointed. 

As others have already mentioned, the wait times do get pretty crazy sometimes, highly recommend that you make a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is delicious. Do not expect fast service - this place is laid back but really popular so you're bound to wait longer than normal for your food. BUT the wait is always worth it. The Massaman curry is the best in the city."}
{"text":"great food, Khao San Road still remains superior."}
{"text":"There was a long line to put in our name on the waiting list. Normally I would of moved onto the next location, but we waiting it out.  Soon enough we were at the bar enjoying a Thai beer and seated shortly after. I ended up ordering beef soup. It was legit.  

There were 2 tables where you could sit on the ground and eat at a low table.  I would suggest calling ahead to reserve it if you can remember!

Atmosphere was solid. It would be a perfect place for a first date, party, or just a regular night out with friends to enjoy Thai food."}
{"text":"Very good food, had the green curry and some appetizers--fried squash, chicken and spring rolls. This is not an easy place to eat at if you are watching carb intake, however. 95% of menu is noodles and rice based, but of course, very very flavourful. Everything was super tasty, especially the squash appetizer. We sat on the stage on the floor, which I wouldn't recommend if you have back issues because three days later I am still sore. Next time I would go back and sit at a regular table and drink water all day to splurge in the evening."}

{"text":"Food: 5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5

One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Great for groups, but make reservations. Been here many times, for dinner and lunch. 

Must Try:
Green Curry Rice: My favourite thing on the menu just because I love curry and the bamboo shoots.
Mango Sticky rice: it's seasonal, I haven't had any luck the past few times I've been. 
Thai Bucket: a big bucket of alcohol, great for sharing. Just something fun to have with friends.
Grabong (Fried battered squash fritters): Definitely something to share with friends, it's a little on the sweet side, but I couldn't stop eating them. Anything fried is pretty good to me. 


Ox tail: Very flavourful and saucy, a little too sweet for me, but I'm not one with a sweet tooth.
Khao Soi: Served with egg noodles, which I didn't prefer as much, but still delicious.

Atmosphere: Loud, but fun. 

Service: If we get seated in the corner, or that little area on the left, sometimes it is a little hard for us to flag down a waitress to order, or even to get our glasses of water refilled. Most of the time I'm there, I'm not in a rush, so I didn't mind.

Definitely will go back again...and again..and again."}
{"text":"Thee best Thai food in Toronto! Hands down!! Waiting to go back!"}
{"text":"I was incredibly happy to find this restaurant on a rainy night in Toronto. 

We ordered a few curries and pad thai. The food was simply delicious. I look forward to going back to try more things. 

The staff was friendly and the service was great. 

We went on a Friday night and it was packed! We waited about 20 minutes for a table, which I guess is becoming average in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm with 4 people without a reservation - I think we got lucky because it only took 15 minutes to seat us. The place is pretty big and it was packed. I would recommend making a reservation unless you can wait 15-45 minutes for a table.

Food is 4/5
- started with the spring rolls, grabong (squash fritters), starter Tom Yum soup - everything was yummy
- Pad Thai was simple and well-made
- Khao Soi (noodles in golden curry) - rich and delicious! Could be shared between 2 people especially if you had appetizers to start. Beware if you're wearing white: it's saucy and may splash onto your clothes
- Gaeng Masaman with braised beef - hearty beef stew with hint of curry
- Khao Pla Tawt (Basa Fillet) - the fish was breaded and was cooked well. The chili sauce that came on the side was extremely spicy
- they have one dessert: mango on sticky rice which was nice and well-made but not for everyone
- I didn't try the cocktails as I found them to be a bit over-priced ($11 to $13) considering there are some great cocktail bars in Toronto serving higher quality cocktails at around the same price
-plates can be shared or eaten separately

Service was 4/5 - service was friendly and considering how busy it was, the food came out fairly quickly

If you're looking for desserts or cocktails, I would recommend sharing a few plates here for your main meal and going to another place for dessert/drinks.

I would recommend this place for 4 people. There were also tables for 6-8 people. It has a fun, loud and casual atmosphere and the food is reasonably priced. I would recommend to anyone looking for Thai food in Toronto."}
{"text":"After hearing about Pai as the latest must-try Thai food joint, a visit ensued. It's a fairly decent sized restaurant, though busy enough on a Thursday night that there was a wait, tucked in the sub-level of a building off of Adelaide (and around the corner of the well-known and beloved Khao San Road). 

My date and I started with the grabong as an appetizer. The deep fried squash fritters were piled high and came out hot with a side of delicious garlic tamarind dip. For two people it is quite a lot of fritters, and definitely enough to stimulate the appetite of a larger group. 

I opted for the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken as my main and it definitely did not disappoint, especially at their \"foreigner spicy\" level of heat. It ranks amongst the more delicious pad Thais I've had in my life, though I've yet to visit Thailand for the 100% authentic stuff (grain of salt, if you so please). 

My date had the Khao Soi with braised beef. Having had this dish from Khao San Road many times, I have to say that the Khao Soi from Pai was nothing more special than from Khao San Road. Nevertheless, it was still delicious and the beef was oh-so-tender, you can't go wrong ordering it.

The service was decent during our visit. The server was attentive enough to refill our water glasses when they were looking empty, even though they left our table with a water carafe to help ourselves when needed.

The atmosphere at Pai is different from most Thai restaurants I've visited. From hearsay and others who have visited Thailand, it resembles a market or street from which you would eat authentic Thai food with it's weathered wooden tables and dim lighting. The crowd was mostly young patrons, but there were a few older parties dining as well.

I would recommend trying Pai if you can make a reservation, otherwise the wait times can be quite lengthy."}

Getting In
We didn't get to make a reservation beforehand though it is highly, highly recommended that you do so. Our visit to Pai was kind of a spur of the moment thing, as we were originally planning to go for a nice brunch (it was Saturday) at another place before we changed our minds last minute. We decided to try our luck and just entered the restaurant without calling prior to our arrival.
Thankfully, we were able to grab two seats by the bar without much wait. Other than the bar, the majority of the tables were full and we would've had to wait for awhile otherwise.

Ordering
The bartender who also took care of us was really friendly and helpful. As it was our first time here, we had trouble making decisions on the menu - well my hubby did (I was set on Pad Thai, as it's my go to order whenever it's my first visit at a new Thai restaurant). After receiving a couple of recommendations from the bartender, hubby decided to try their Thai fried rice on the lunch menu. I also opted for their coconut water as it's a must order for me in Thai restaurants.

Pad Thai
In my opinion, I have pretty high standards for Pad Thai; I always order it when I can and because I always order it, I tend to compare restaurants and their versions all the time. At Pai, the dish was delicious but it was not as spicy as I would've liked it to be. It also didn't have enough of the fish sauce taste, which is the original sauce used to cook Pad Thai. The dish was more brown in colour than red, perhaps they used more oyster sauce than chili and fish sauce? Overall, the noodles were cooked well and the dish had a wide variety of vegetables and meat, but to me, the original fish sauce was lacking. And I'm right - the menu online says that the pad thai is cooked using the restaurant's house made tamarind sauce and oyster sauce.
Worth ordering? Yes, but it doesn't seem that authentic to me.

Thai Fried Rice
The sauce on the side is fish sauce! Named nam plik nam pla, it is made with fish sauce, garlic, chili and lime. In our opinion, it was a great complement to the fried rice. The fried egg on top was very crispy and well done while keeping the egg yolk still tender, and overall, the fried rice wasn't too overly flavoured. I quite liked that the rice wasn't fried together with the chicken and vegetables so that you could choose how savoury each bite could be. The dish was a little greasy but it's fried rice after all so you can't complain.

Verdict
Overall, our short lunch at Pai was pretty good. Service was great, and I thought that the price of the dishes were well priced as well. Its casual vibe is a hit for most Torontonians, and it really feels like you're in Thailand during your meal as its interior décor is pretty authentic feeling. It's a great restaurant to come with friends and family, colleagues, after work, or even just by yourself for a quick meal at the bar. Can't make it? Try ordering online through their website!"}
{"text":"Great spot in a great location in downtown TO.  Ox tail curry was my favourite diah but everything was excellent.  Also for dessert they hand the mango pandan sticky rice which was an interesting flavour.  Great service as well and the owner (i think) let us have a free dessert after scoring a free throw in a Mini basketball net.  Dunno if thats gonna be ongoing though."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai place in Toronto. I've been enjoying their dishes since they first opened Kao San Road and have been her many many times. Consistently delicious and full of flavour that you want when eating thai food. The Kao Soi with braised beef is my go to and I can't get enough.
If you haven't been go there NOW!"}
{"text":"Came here without a reservation on a Friday night.  The \"without a reservation\" part is key, so note to make a reservation if you plan to come here.  Anyways, after waiting 50 minutes on a walk-in, we were seated and had a very good meal at a great value.  To summarize, the only downsides about this place are the wait (because people want to go there, so pass given) and the lottery of the people who will be seated next to you since it's close quarters.  I lost on two neighboring parties, but the restaurant can't control that some of their clientele are loud talkers or drama queens on girls night out."}
{"text":"Line up: abandoned; 30 mins to check in, once checked in, another 20 mins. Mind you it was on Friday at 7pm on a TIFF night. Appetizers to give to guests waiting in line as they do at KhaoSan could be helpful to curb the hunger and would result in less people leaving. There were two couples, 1 ahead and 1 behind us who abandoned. 2 star

Food: flavours were fragrant and bold, spice level was as requested, temperature warm to hot, fried squash was crispy, wine was palatable, no dessert because we were two and could not finish what we ordered: 1 fried squash, 1 green chicken curry in coconut, 1 red curry with beef (khao soi) - not enough beef and definitely not enough noodles in the latter. Khao soi was a soupy curry. 4 star

Atmosphere: like what my friends' basements looked like when we hung out, but cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing. Good music, liked the vinyls on the walls. 5 star

Value: $80 with tax and tip for two (we did get a glass of wine each). 3 star 

Overall I would give this place 14/20."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about Pai, I was excited to be in the area a couple of weeks ago, and had the opportunity to try the food.

When I arrived the restaurant wasn't too full and we were able to place our orders quite quickly. The thai iced tea was perfect. My friend ordered the pad thai and I wish I had ordered the same.

I ordered the Khao Soi, and I was not impressed.  The curry did not taste fully cooked, the sauce was very salty and unappealing. Additionally when I left the restaurant I had only what could be described a a case of mild food poisoning. 

Would I eat at pai again? Maybe. But I would stick to the pad thai and the iced tea."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai I've found in Canada. Similar spices to what I found in Puckett, but with higher quality ingredients. Bartenders were all awesome people. I went nearly every day. Pad Thai, green curry, and the noodle soup are all killer. Shrimp are of an excellent size. Great place."}
{"text":"Good food and good energy in this place. Crowded during peak times, plan to wait and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Casual & fun atmosphere. Super friendly & attentive servers. Good prices. Accepts resevation. 4 level of spiciness to choose from! What more could i ask for? Love this new addition to the Toronto Thai food scene, its up there with, if not better, Khao San Road, Sukho Thai, and Sabai Sabai Kitchen.

Love: Chef Nuits pad thai
Hate: I was brave and ordered the level 4 spiciness. Way too spicy but I still ate everything cause it was so delicious. The Thai Ice Tea helped tone down the spice a bit :)"}
{"text":"Love the food here! It's a pub like atmosphere with dim lighting,  and gets pretty  noisy and crowded.  Busy times will lead to an hour and a half wait,  so try to come on a weekday for lunch or at a less busy time of day.  The khao soi is definitely a stellar dish. I get the khao soi  with braised beef.  I do think that they should give more noodles because I am always left with leftover beef and no more noodles! The braised beef is tender and tasty,  and the soup base is coconutty perfection.  Don't be afraid to order spicy... It isn't really that spicy in my opinion, and gives a nice kick.  I have also ordered the gaeng masamam with  beef, which is okay but nothing special.  It's a basic Asian tasting curry. The Thai ice tea is yummy and compliments the food.  It reminds me of cha time's original milk tea but with a slightly different flavour. Similar though.  I think my favourite on the menu has to be the Tom yum soup.  Every spoon is super flavourful and delicious. I can have a litre of it. It has a strong tomato edge to it,  which I think compliments the soup so well. Overall,  love this place!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Ambiance is super hip with a very young, city feel. Food is also good but nothing over the top. This place sticks to what it's good at and doesn't overdo it."}
{"text":"Awesome decoration/setup inside. Very authentic food. Best Thai in the city"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Decor is reminiscent of 70s Vietnam era with records on the walls, pictures of presumably Thai Military men and other hipstery things.

Had the squash fritters as an app which were fantastic, lightly battered and enough for 3. Ordered the Pad Thai for a main which had a reasonable portion size but didn't really seem like anything special. Other Thai places give you something similar for less money as this was $15.50

Last, the service wasn't great. We arrived right around the peak of lunch time and by the time we finished our meals our section had died down and thus we were ignored for 20 minutes while we tried to find our server.

This is definitely one of the nicer Thai places in the city, but you seem to pay for it as it seems roughly 40 percent pricier than other Thai places."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour. Go! Don't worry about the line up, service is fast and friendly, you'll be seated in no time. Don't skip dessert!"}
{"text":"The best pad thai in the city! This place is always packed and that's no surprise. The food is fresh and very flavourful. Be prepared to wait a bit though."}
{"text":"Good good and GOOD! 
This place is the closest thing to an authentic Thai food!
Their pad thai is amazing and their pad kra pao (thai fried basil) 
If you love SPICY then get the 'thai spicy'

I have also tried their masaman which is good (but pretty creamy and fatty) as well as their 'kao soi' Let's just say most of the food on the menu is GREAT!

The prices are a a little high and the wait time can be extremely long but the wait is definitely worth it! The atmosphere is very loud and a little dark (might not be great for younger kids)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great authentic food and a cool environment. Often has a line, so plan ahead. 
Great place to take friends."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! It is surprisingly difficult to find a decent Thai restaurant in Toronto. Pai and Khao San Road are my favourite. Pai's pad thai is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Can't complain about anything on the menu. Restaurant itself is an experience. The staff is really friendly. Try and get a seat at the bar. The bar tenders are great dinner company. Pad grow prow is my favourite main dish on the menu. Squash fritters are a must!"}
{"text":"Best pad thai in the city..great service, kind of loud and gets really busy but is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great Thai food and amazing service. The wait wont be long if you come a bit early and show up with your full party, but the food and ambience is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food ***** - Service *****- Ambience ****

My wife and I had stumbled upon this place and we absolutely loved it. The wait time was not bad. The food was delicious. I had the spicy chicken on rice and she had a soup. 
This has become our return to place."}
{"text":"Love coming here when I'm craving Thai downtown. Everything that I've tried has been delicious with no complaints at all. 

Food: The portions are well sized and filling. All their dishes are full of flavour that leaves you craving for more. My most recent dishes were the Chicken Fried Rice ($11) and the Green Curry ($11). The fried rice doesn't look like much but you'll fall in love once you try it. The rice is cooked to PERFECTION - it's fluffy and actually looks like individual grains of rice (none of them stuck together at all). The portion is enough for two meals if you can stop yourself from eating it all! The green curry only comes in mild or spicier. It's so rich in flavour and packed with large pieces of chicken. They definitely don't skimp on the meats in all their dishes. I would highly recommend these dishes. 

Service: The entire staff is super friendly and efficient. They are always smiling and usually joking around. For how busy they get, the food comes out fast enough. By 12:05pm they will have a full house for weekday lunch so you will definitely want to get here by 11:40am especially if you have a big group. 

Atmosphere: It's super casual and laid back. I love their entire music playlist and can jam the whole meal long. It gets loud though since you sit pretty close to other tables and can hear everyone speaking. 

Tip: Curry in a Hurry is a preselected curry of the day that changes each day. Costs $10 flat and is takeout only. Well worth it especially if you're in a rush. I was in and out within 5 minutes. 

Overall I would definitely continue coming here. Try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had their veggie pad thai and it was really good. I went here because my go to (Khao San Road) decided to move. I would come back and try on of their curries or apps for sure! I liked their set up a little better than Khao San Road, the decor was more fun. 

Wish they would have more veggie/vegan options. Not sure if all their food, after choosing tofu as the protein, guarantees it being vegetarian. Definitely will try to remember to ask the staff."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff and interesting decor. Definitely was regualr spot. Did the i mention the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. I liked the look of the menu online, but when we got here I couldn't wait to go in. The whole restaurant smelled amazing. There was a brilliant buzz about the place and the atmosphere was very welcoming. We had a brilliant experience from start to finish. The waiter was great. We both went for \"Thai spice\" level, which is exactly what it says on the tin, spicy! But awesome. I had the curry in the coconut and the chicken wings and both were amazing. I totally recommend."}
{"text":"Very unique northern Thai food - big fan of their veggie wrap ( forgot the name of the lead used in the wrap)."}
{"text":"If you're look for good Thai food then Pai is the place to check out.

Chef Nuit's Pad Thai is extremely flavourful and is probably my go-to meal at Pai. I've tried all the starters and I would rank Pai as one of the top restaurants in Toronto when it comes to their appetizers. My wife, who's vegetarian, usually goes for the vegan green curry and has nothing but good things to say about it.

Don't order Pai through UberEATS though. It's probably not fair to compare ordering food for delivery to eating at a restaurant, but the last time I ordered through UberEATS it tasted like Thai Express.

Out of all the Thai spots in Toronto, especially since Khao San Road closed down, I would have to say that Pai tops them all!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Love their tom yum soup! The most authentic and tasty Tom yum soup I have had in Toronto. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"If I had the money, I'd eat here everyday. I try a couple new dishes each time I visit and am always pleasantly surprised. Awesome staff and a comfortable atmosphere make this one of my favourite places in the city! You won't be disappointed... but if you are, then you probably aren't human."}
{"text":"Moo Grab Pad Gra Prow Thai Spicy is my favourite! They are consistent with their quality!"}
{"text":"Cute place, and good food. 

We ordered the green curry with shrimp which was served in a coconut (*extra brownie points) and the coconut jasmine rice.   The green curry was sweet, not too spicy, and had a perfect consistency.  Along with the jasmine rice cooked in coconut milk this combo is a must try (i know it sounds like i'm going nuts - and excuse the pun- but this is a must have since it marries so well with the curry flavours and the coconut flesh that you can scrape out during the meal)  

The only downsides to this place is its popularity!  We had to book the restaurant at 9 pm and it was still packed (and if you are trying to catch up with old friends or keen for a personal conversation this may not be the place since it does get noisy) 

However, a very good choice for thai food in the city :)"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that it's always busy there and hard to get a table. Not surprising given how good the food is.

Get the fresh coconut water if you're eating something spicy. Get the Laab or the squash fritters as an appetizer. Every main dish I've tried was fantastic. You can't go wrong with Pai."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great food & excellent service.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant! The decoration inside the restaurant is nice and food was great.

The service could be better so I gave 4 stars.

Pai is my new favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Incredible pad thai and squash fritters, large portions. The servers and host are always pleasant and provide excellent service. Always very busy, expect to wait 45 minutes to be seated on a weekday and up to an hour on a Saturday. Pai is worth waiting for. Sukhothai and Khao San Road are amazing restaurants as well."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in the city. The food is authentic and the decor is cheeky and playful. A great option for dinner before a musical, as the Mirvish theatres are right down the street"}
{"text":"Amazing food, terrible service ! From the beginning to the end of the meal I had to flag down different waiters for everything we needed, to order, to get water, the bill. I wanted to pay by debit and get a box for my
Leftovers so I waited and waited and eventually put cash on the table and left. I'm not even sure who was supposed to be serving us as we got the attention of someone different every time (maybe they didn't know either) I was very disappointed after reading all the good reviews. The food was very delicious, we started off with spring rolls and the squash fritters which were my favourite. Overall I would not come back because of the poor service."}
{"text":"We dropped by for lunch and had the signature Chef Nuit's pad thai.  it was quite good - tangy, flavourful and very spicy.  It's probably the best in the downtown core -- but mainly because there isn't a lot of competition.  Elsewhere in chinatown and further north has just as good, though.  Service was a bit slow, but understandably given that the place was packed.

My main issue is that the place is VERY LOUD! Like a high school cafeteria, but noisier.  We could barely hear each other and our throats were a bit hoarse afterwards having to almost shout our conversation.  Definitely not a place for a business lunch to chat leisurely. Yelp lists the Noise Level here as 'Average', which is completely wrong."}
{"text":"Pai is one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto for three reasons: authentic and delicious food, plenty of seating, and relatively quick service. My favourite is the green curry (with shrimp) that comes in a coconut. The curry is incredibly aromatic and even more tasty. I like to scrape out the coconut meat with a spoon and mix that in with the curry sauce, which I actually haven't seen a lot of people do! 

The khao soi is pretty good too, as is a beef dish that I forget the name of. I find the pad thai underwhelming. When I ordered it, it was dry and not very tasty, but it could just have been a subpar plate. 

You can order any level of spice, from absolutely no heat to Thai spicy (watch out-this one's hot). If you try to come here for dinner on a weekend, note that it'll be VERY busy (expect 40-60min wait depending on group size). However you can leave a cellphone number and have them text you when the table is ready, so you don't have to physically wait there. 

TIP: this restaurant has a great private room that you can book for no extra fee (just a set gratuities that automatically comes on the bill). It seats about 20 people max and is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"From the service to the ambiance to the food and drinks, whether you are dining with family or hanging out with friends...you can never go wrong with Pai. 

I have visited Pai twice (both times on a Sunday around 5:00 PM) and I was seated right away each time. I never made reservations, but I would suggest making one if you have a large group, or just arrive soon after the restaurant opens because it gets pretty busy as the night goes on. 

Probably because it was not busy when I last visited Pai, the host let me sit at a table in the cushioned floor seating area even though I was still waiting on my three friends. It was a longer wait than expected, but it was not an issue for them (there were multiple empty tables and I made sure to ask every time someone checked up on me). 

Drinks:
* Thai Iced Tea -- a must-drink every time
* Pai Sangria -- never tried, but looking forward to it on my next visit :)

Starters:
* Thai Style Chicken Wings (3) -- good but nothing special
* Grabong -- something different and a good portion for more than 2 people

Mains:
*Khao Soi with braised beef -- very tender, flavourful, and big portion = very filling!
*Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut) with chicken -- creamy curry, full of flavour, and you can scrape and eat the coconut 'meat' at the end of your meal (hands down, my favourite dish at Pai)
*Gaeng Masaman with braised beef -- reminded us of beef rendang, which was good but nothing special
*Pad Gra Prow with pork -- simple yet delicious (my friend devoured the entire plate)

I cannot wait to dine at Pai again. Not only would I like to sip on their sangria, I would love to try some of their soup dishes, too."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and had a great experience.

Boring stuff: Food was excellent - had squash fritters for appetizer, and shrimp pad thai and basa fillets for entrées.   Lots of space at this location compared to khao san road.  We will definitely come here first before khao san and sukhothai.

Good stuff: Amazing 90s hip hop playlist featuring pharaoh monch, gangstarr, odb, and I think brand nubian was playing when we left.  5 stars for this alone."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Thai food but Pai has brought it to another level for me! It is a really popular spot, and it was super busy both times we were here for dinner. I've only been here a couple times but I have definitely become a fan. 

So far we had the northern thai sausage platter, green curry with chicken in a coconut, khao soi, gaeng masaman and pad thai. Everything is super delicious but my favourite so far is definitely the khao soi - it's so perfectly creamy! And beware of the green curry - for someone who loves spicy food, the foreigner spice level was almost too spicy! 

The restaurant is a bit dark and it's hard to see what you're eating, but everything is great otherwise."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with one friend on a Wednesday night, and as expected, there was an hour long wait. If you tell yourself it's worth it, then it almost makes the hour go by faster.

Anyways, when you finally get the menu in front of you, you'll be faced with only a small set of options. Makes ordering easy. Almost everyone around me had an order of Pad Thai and Khao Soi, so my friend and I decided this was probably the safer bet and followed suit. 

The dishes did not disappoint. Everything was delicious!! The Khao Soi in particular was memorable. It's nice and hearty, making it almost like comfort food. Perfect for cold weather. We also shared a portion of the Mango Sticky Rice. It is extremely filling (you are after all, eating a blob glutinous of rice...) so make sure you share if you're already up to your neck with delicious food.  

I also want to add that service while slow, is extremely accommodating. My friend was vegetarian, and they were more than happy to make modifications to each dish that we ordered."}
{"text":"TL;DR - Food came cold, appetizer came AFTER our entrees and waitress was inattentive to our table.  Not the best first impression and will probably not be back.  My experiences at Khao San Road have been far superior in food and service.

---

I've been meaning to try Pai for a long time now since it received so much hype a few months ago. The vibe and food from the restaurant reminds me a lot of Khao San Road with slight differences.  I came here on a Sunday night at 6:30pm for a group of 4 and we did make reservations 3 weeks in advance!  The restaurant is easy to spot on Duncan St. but there's limited parking on the actual street.  You may find better luck parking on the side streets of Richmond or Adelaide or King... but if you're up for a further walk, there is actually free parking just north of Queen.  

The restaurant itself is bigger than I imagined.  It fits probably 50 people (with reasonable space between the tables) in the dining area and along the bar.  It is in the basement of a building though and there is patio seating.  It's pretty loud inside (throughout the entire meal) but that's to be expected.   

Our order:
Thai Iced Tea - Very sweet but very flavorful.  I would recommend asking for less sugar or waiting for the ice to melt.  
 Gai Satay - Pretty much just a few chicken pieces on a skewer.  Was not impressed... food came out cold and the peanut sauce is just mediocre.  For 4 people, it's a skewer per person but also $3/skewer!  
Sai Ua Platter - Probably my biggest complaint and let-down for the night.  This dish came out cold as well and AFTER our entrees! Our waiter didn't seem that knowledgeable when we asked her what it was and we still had no idea how to eat it when it came.  I wish they explained how we were supposed to enjoy it properly since it came in parts.
Khao Soi - My favorite from Khao San Road and definitely not my favorite from Pai.  It was small, very few noodles but a lot of sauce/curry and \"other stuff\" but not enough meat.  Disappointed.  Also came out cold...
Gaeng Kiaw Wan - The curry itself was flavorful but a little more viscous than I would've liked.  Not enough rice to soak up all the curry (or to share).  The presentation was cool though and we attempted to eat the coconut meat with little success - I think they hollowed it out already.

My impression of Pai was average at best for the food portion and I would leave it at that if not for the service we received.  My biggest complaint from the evening came from our COLD food and our waitress' lack of attention.  We ordered two apps and one came AFTER our entrees were already done and someone removed our plates/cutlery.  We asked time and time again but the waitress would just return and say \"Did you get it yet?\".  When we did get our order, we were already upset that it was also cold and we didn't know how to eat it (waitress clearly didn't either).  Needless to say, we didn't leave very satisfied or terribly full. The food portions are relatively small in general so I wouldn't recommend sharing entrees.

For the entire meal, we paid almost $80 total before tip (about $20/person) and that's on the high side for Thai food in my opinion.  We sat there for probably 45 mins longer than we should've  just because our app was late.  Even though their menus may be similar, the service and food aren't up to the standard I'm used to at Khao San Road.  After the meal, I posted my disappointment on IG and the owner of Pai actually responded! They apologized and offered me a free entrée if I ever visited the restaurant again.  I appreciate the owner being reactive to my comments, but they should've been more proactive while we were there.  The waitress (and busboys and other wait staff) knew that we were upset so there's no reason why they couldn't have said anything while we were dining; that would've been a more impactful apology. Anyway, for that follow-up, I give them one more star than I think they deserved, but I will still probably not go to Pai again.  I don't live downtown and the journey to venture there is more of a hassle than it's worth."}
{"text":"Found this place searching on Yelp while we were in Toronto for 2 days. What a great find! Service was superb and the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for. Never had Thai Iced Tea before and fell in love. Really enjoyed the chicken wings, soup and mains. Could not have been better!!!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic and authentic Thai food.  Went there with a group of 8 people so we ordered many different items from their menu.  Great quality, very fresh and tender chicken, pork and shrimp, all dishes were perfectly seasoned.  Felt like I was in Thailand.  Also, it was a very friendly and relaxed atmosphere.  Much better than Khao San Road."}
{"text":"Love Pai!  Go here all the time, food is fantastic, atmosphere is great, service is quite good.  Busy times it's tough to get a seat and make a reservation but being popular has it's downsides.  Would recommend anyone looking for Thai in the downtown core goes here!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The restaurant is more spacious than Khao Sao Road and it has a great vibe. My friend and I ordered spring rolls for starters and Thai Iced Tea (basically a Thai version of milk tea) + Coconut Water. The drinks came in large cups and I love the iced tea. The tea was brewed strongly and its sweetness wasn't overpowering. 

I had the Pad Gra Prow with chili fish sauce (prik nam pla) served on the side. The minced pork was stir fried with basil and red peppers, served on top of the rice with a fried egg and some crispy barbecue pork. It was absolutely scrumptious and I had to stop myself from wolfing it down in two minutes! 

My friend's Kao Soi was really delicious as well. She chose the beef option and the thick egg noodles were chewy. If you're into sweet curry, this is the dish for you! The noodles were bathed in a pot of yellow curry with beef and it was super creamy and rich. 

We'll definitely be back again to try out the other dishes. I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea & Pad Gra Prow!"}
{"text":"I love tge deep fried squash and the green curry served in a young coconut.  The phai thai is also amazing.   I highly recommend to make reservation as the place always busy"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious food I must admit, ordered this from uber-eats, despite being not as 'fresh' coming from uber. But it still taste brilliantly, slightly greasy but that's to be expected from a restaurant. Ordered the thai style chicken fried rice"}
{"text":"As good as everybody has said it is! Nice relaxed vibe, efficient and warm servers/staff. Flavours are authentic and strong, prices are affordable to try different dishes with friends."}
{"text":"This place is a steal in downtown, northern Thai food with a modern twist."}
{"text":"Frequented Khao San Road in the past (at times 4 times a month). Something lacking here with regards to flavour, can't be because i'm bored of it, haven't been to either restaurant in 8 + months. Also ordered \"thai spicy\" and didn't have any heat. Khao San Road uses thai bird eye chilis i believe while i got none of those in my pad gra prao at Pai. OK, nothing special (anymore?)."}
{"text":"They will put items in your plate that are not on the menu so if you have allergies or dietary restrictions you'd better  ask about every item on your plate to know what it is. This is poor service"}
{"text":"I frequent Khao San Road, and Pai is essentially the same restaurant (although no longer connected I am told) with the bonus of accepting reservations :) it is also much better for groups due to it's size.
My go-to-dish is the Pad Gra Prao, minced meat perfectly seasoned on a bed of rice with a fried egg on top and spicy fish sauce on the side. You can customize all dishes for the level of spice. 
If it's your first time, you must try the Khao Soi; with chicken if they give you the option. Not sure why but it's noticeably better than the brisket. I would highly recommend sharing it because it is too rich to eat all of it by yourself."}
{"text":"I've had Pai's food quite a number of times (in person, delivery, and takeout), and have always been happy with the taste and quality of the food. They always have a huge lineup, so be prepared for a pretty lengthy wait for your food!

My favourites are the Pad Gra Prow with minced beef, and the fried rice. The fritters, spring rolls, Pad Thai, and Massaman beef curry are also great."}
{"text":"55$ for 2 and we ate very well(no alcohol). Food was delicious and the ingredients so fresh. It had an hour wait but they took our name and sent us a sms when the table was ready. Service was fast and courteous. Ambience is great! Very good experience! The only thing I would have liked is more chicken in my pad thai."}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal here. The staff was incredibly friendly, the vibe was mellow and the food was delicious. We were put on a huge wait list at Khao San Road and decided to wander over and try something new. We were really happy we made the 2 minute walk to Pai. We ate the squash fritters, beef salad, coconut curry, massaman curry, pineapple fried rice and finished with the mango sticky rice. All of the dishes were fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. An amazing place not to be missed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with amazing food and friendly service. Everyone in my family ordered a different dish, and all of them were delicious. I had the Khao Soi with chicken, and I would absolutely come back and order it again. The lemongrass iced tea was light and refreshing on a warm summer day, especially as we were seated outside. It was a near perfect dining experience!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for lunch at 1:30 PM before Christmas and this place was packed! It was a 15 minute wait and was seated in the corner of the restaurant. Good vibes and tunes playing in the background. Our waitress kept rushing my friend and I to order even though the lunch rush was lowly dying. Ordered the infamous Pad Thai with Tofu and Khao Soi with Chicken Breast. Pad Thai was delicious and it wasn't too tangy like some places do and it had a good balance of tofu, veggies and noodles. Khao Soi was ok. It was my first time having it and I had nothing to compare it to. I am not a big fan of eating a meal with sweetness (ie. coconut milk) unless it is dessert. The Khao Soi wasn't too sweet and the crispy egg noodles added a nice crunch to the meal. I'd come back here again, either right when they open or close to the end of lunch hours. Not a fan of waiting and talking really loudly in crowded places."}
{"text":"Staff (especially Emilie) and food were a great combo. I've lived in Thaland long enough to know a great Thai retardant.  I didn't think a restaurant of this size would have the authenticity."}
{"text":"Tell your mom, tell your dad. Pai is where it's at. Masaman or get out. Monster beers left and right. Don't kid yourself. This is the real deal. Chicken wings are serious good."}
{"text":"Yay!! This place was everything I expected it to be and more. I was with a semi - large party on a Sunday night and the wait was a little over an hour, but it was definitely worth it. Take the opportunity to make reservations in advance to avoid the wait time! 

I ordered the braised beef khao soi. The broth was silky, the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the noodles had a slightly chewy texture that I loved. 

Our waitress was the sweetest lady ever and was very attentive and knowledgeable. We threw lots of questions at her and you could tell that she knew what she was talking about! 

Try this place. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic, fresh and delicious. Don't miss the Pad Thai or Green Curry."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Toronto.  Reminds me of home cooked meals growing up.  At least go here every few weeks. All the main dishes are a must try."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and staff was courteous. Portion size is ample and price is fair. 

If you are looking for a bustling yet comfortable stop for you Thai food fix, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic but as with Chef Nuit's previous digs (Khao San Road) the service is slow when its busy. Seems the kitchen is backlogged a lot of the time.

If you have a longer lunch or are not in a rush for dinner, its fine, just know what you're getting into.

Menu seems to be evolving but everything we had was a hit. Come have some before it gets too busy to get a seat :)"}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday with my bunch of friends. Had their crispy pork rice; not sure what they call it. And loving it. 

Love how they let you choose the spicy level. The ambiance is good just a little bit noisy during dinner time. Took a long time to ask for a bill, but the waiters are friendly."}
{"text":"partial review

-Building on her previous restaurants' menus, Nuit aims to deliver the most authentic Thai experience at Pai. Here, you'll see a few Regular staples like her yellow curry (Khao Soi) but plenty of new exciting North Thai plates to peruse. Actually, dining with just two people was pretty stressful for a hard-core food lover, as I literally wanted to order every dish. Regardless of what you order, though, everything is fully shareable, and the portions are rather generous so expect to ask for a take-home box to finish it off.
-For those who worry that Thai food may end up being too spicy for their taste, at Pai, you can fully customize the amount of heat in your dishes. From Mai Phet (no spice) to Phet Mak Mak (authentic Thailand style spicy)- you can have it how you want it no matter what. I see a semi-dangerous drinking game in the future with this.

Grabong ($10)
Vegetarian Deep Fried Squash Fritters with Garlic Tamarind Dip

[12]

Umm... yes. Guys, just order this. It was damn delicious and so addictive that if I didn't feel like I was eating a savoury funnel cake and thousands of likely calories, I would have polished it off myself and ordered another. Light and crisp on the outside, and fluffy and sweet within, paired up with a tangy bright tamarind dip. Okay, confession time here folks. This dip tasted like the \"sweet and sour sauce\" from McDonalds- and obviously I mean that in the BEST-WAY-POSSIBLE! Who can tell me they don't adore that stuff? WHO?!

Som Tum Tad with Salted Crab ($12)
Green Papaya, Long Beans, Chili &Tamarind Salad, Pork Rinds, Shrimp Chips & Noodles

[11]

Wow. This is not like any papaya you will ever order off justeat.ca. Sweet, sour, supple, crisp, and garnished with the briny salty pop of the fermented bits of black crab. The result is a very well balanced, vibrant dish with wickedly crunchy pork rinds and foamy shrimp chips for scooping. Yes, please.

Chef Nuit Chicken Pad Thai ($14)
Stir Fried Rice Noodle, Tamarind Sauce, Roasted Peanuts

[13]

Again, please forget the ketchup-laden crap you're likely accustomed to eating in take-out boxes. If it's not tamarind-based, it's not real Pad Thai. Chef Nuit's version is still semi-sweet, but is surprisingly light, refreshing and well balanced by the toasty note of roasted crushed peanuts. Insider tip- do add a squirt of lime from the wedge they include on the side- it really helps cut through the jammy sweetness of the tamarind and balance everything out beautifully. 

Gaeng Masaman with Braised Beef ($15)
Braised Beef in a Peanut Tamarind Curry with Potatoes, Deep Fried Shallots and Jasmine Rice

[14]

This was my favourite dish of the night. The massive hunks of tender beef swam in a rich aromatic sauce. In retrospect, it actually had a similar flavour profile to the Pad Thai but with an opposite emphasis- more nutty savoury lusciousness with just a little sweet fruit flavour to balance everything out. No complaints here other than I wish I had room to eat more of it (thank goodness they offer good quality tuberware for curry take-away).

Closing Remarks:

-For 2 cocktails, and 4 dishes, the bill came to $95 including tax and tip and we went home with lunch for the next day. Talk about a fantastic deal. The food was really, really delicious (and I would rush back to work my way through the rest of the curries and mains), the cocktails were tasty and reasonably priced (for once!), the service was friendly and casual, and the place had a young fun vibe. 
-In conclusion, Pai would be a fantastic choice for a range of occasions. From group get-togethers on a budget (where you can then order a lot of the menu to share), to quick bites nights before a show downtown, this would be an ideal spot for a fantastic meal. In contrast, I would say it's probably not your best bet if you're looking for an intimate drawn out date night as it's a bit too casual and fast paced to be great for that, but otherwise, there are a lot of occasions I'm looking for just this kind of joint. And the best part? They take reservations- so as long as you can think ahead, there's no need to worry about waiting in the overflow bar for a seat at this popular joint."}
{"text":"They're overrated for the amount of people that flock to this place for dinner, but in terms of actual Thai food, I must admit they're pretty legitimate. I've been here at around early evening and have managed to salvage a table without lining up excessively. We ordered the Pad Thai and Coconut Curry (which they for gimmick serve in a coconut shell) which was a good portion to share. Prices are a little steep, but considering the area is decent. 

With drinks expect to pay around $25-30 per person, but if you're looking for authentic Pad Thai, then come here."}
{"text":"Visited Pai on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. For starters, my friend and I ordered Miang Kung and spring rolls. The spring rolls were nothing special but Miang Kung was unlike anything I had before. The taste grew on me. 

For main, we ordered Khao Soi and Pad Gra Prow..both vegetarian. They were delicious!

This was my second time visiting Pai and would definitely visit again and recommend to friends.

The servers were really pleasant as well."}
{"text":"It was just OK. Khao San road was too busy so we decided to eat at the bar here (which apparently you don't have to wait if there's a spot)- still took over 1 hour for our food to arrive from when we ordered. The food was meh- nothing to write home about, although I have had some amazing authentic thai in Mississauga and hamilton this one disappointed. The green curry was watery and the pad Thai portion felt small. Would not return here."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, the food is good...if you are willing to wait for 45mins+. Service is mad slow. I went on a saturday, I know is extra busy but it literally took that long to wait for the food after ordering. 

Maybe the reason the food taste good is because they starve you for a long time so by the time you eat the food, anything will taste amazing."}
{"text":"Magically delicious! This is the most fun Thai restaurant I've ever been to, and the food was some of the best too. Had the Starter Soup and Khao Soi. Soup was bright, full of flavor. Has a nice slow heat. Khao Soi was with braised beef, incredibly rich curry that has intense flavor developed in it, delicious noodles, and if you like it hot add all the spice. Will definitely need to make this a frequent stop to try more goodness."}
{"text":"Cozy place with good food... Staff is friendly and the service is quick.. what more to ask :)"}
{"text":"I happened to pass by this spot and was intrigued by the crowd and busyness of the place. I figured \"why not\", and requested a seat for one. I was a little nervous since I just heard the hostess tell the group before me that the wait was 45 min-1 hour, and it was only 1.5 hours before closing. Luckily flying solo has its perks, as I was seated immediately at the bar. 

The place was super busy and the bartenders were always busy scrambling around making drinks and serving food, but they made sure to stay attentive. The lady I had was nice and always made sure she got to everyone at the bar. 

I ordered the Sai Ua Platter, Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken and a sangria. Everything was delicious! I was so full I could barely finish. I asked for mild on the spice level but def should've opted for a level higher. The sausage came with sticky rice and it was such a nice presentation. They gave a nice helping of the pad Thai and everything was perfect.

I see why the place is so popular and would def come again!"}
{"text":"Great appetizer (that crazy sweet potato thing); terribly uncomfortable outside stools (please get something more comfortable for your customers who are paying good money to dine there!); poor serving size for the green curry for $17...honestly, I felt it was a rip off to be served a dish with nothing but sauce and 5 shrimp and a few strands of bamboo shoots! I've been to many other better thai places that actually give you a decent amount of veggies as well as shrimp (or whatever the protein) so this was a huge disappointment. I complained to the bar staff who offered to bring us another dish but explained 'that's just the way they make it'. Well it's enough to make me not go back. 

Take an example from many other amazing thai restaurants - ie: Thai Elephant on Queen West - and see what it means to offer your customers REAL value & quality for their money."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Thai food, so we ordered some takeout for ourselves and three kids on a Sunday night.  We had chicken pad Thai, shrimp pad Thai, spring rolls, and jasmine rice.  Everything was really good!  My husband said it was the best pad Thai he's ever had."}
{"text":"This review is intended for its new \"curry of the day\" in the extended space, NOT its main restaurant session. I have been to the restaurant for lunch dozens of times and also regularly take out its $10 curry of the day. Recently they opened a new space for that during lunch time which is a good opportunity. After trying its green curry, which I am so familiar with, I was very disappointed with the poor food quality: pink coloured dark meat, watery source and 2/3 of usual volume. It is disappointing to see that PAi cut corners to reduce cost when expanding. I do hope that they will improve the offering and give us the same quality soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service at take-out. The guy handing off the food tonight needs to correct his attitude. I regret tipping.

Food was not up to the hype.

Disappointment,  overall."}
{"text":"Une bouffe vraiment excellente, le service très cool. Nous étions 4 adultes et 4 enfants et on amangé comme des rois. On a commandé pleins de plats et tout partager. Tout était bon

Seul hic, il a fallu réserver et revenir 1 heure plus tard. Pas évident avec des enfants, mais je vous recommande fortement ce restaurant à Toronto. Bien situé et bouffe excellente.

Great food, a1 service. Recommend this place"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, and very reasonable prices. I couldn't ask for more from a restaurant. The place is decorated in a pretty cool way and the washrooms have thai language lessons looping on which is lots of fun. 

Its also a great location cause you can go there before enjoying a show or going to a pub. 

Honestly I can't think of another thai restaurant in the city that meets every aspect of a perfect score like this one."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for a change from the same old \"salad king\", and as soon as I arrived inside you could tell it was very popular and different niche in crowd. It had random photos and other random things just put all over the place. If you're looking for a quiet place don't go here as its just beaming with excitement and fun.

The place is so busy and it pushes all the servers to the limit here, but they hold their own here and do a pretty good job in all. You may want to make a reservation here early on in the day so you don't have to wait for 30mins, so don't expect to be seated in the evening right away if you don't make a reservation. 

The food is just totally to die for here from the basics of \" spring rolls\" to \"Thai noodles\" you'll enjoy each bite of whatever dish you get. It will cost a bit more than \"salad king\" but worth the extra dollars."}
{"text":"It has great ambiance with pub feeling. We took reservation but still, we need to wait for the table. However, the food is absolutely amazing! The yellow curry lamb is an absolutely great choice.

In general, the food deserves the great rating, but the wait time and the noise level cost 1 star."}
{"text":"Came back multiple times since initial post, so I've tried basically every item on the menu.
The beef noodle soup and the coconut curry are my favourites in addition to the Pad Gra. Their pad thai is delicious, but not nearly as unique as the other items on their menu.

I also love the expanded drink menu, where I recently ordered their white wine sangria which was made using Reisling, guava, lychee, pineapple, and a few more exotic ingredients. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible! Not like any other Thai food I've had. I had no clue what to order, but ended up with something new that I loved! Service was extremely friendly and helpful. Although there seemed to be a constant line to wait for a table, it went fast. It was nice they text when your table is ready so that we could walk around a bit. It was a really fun place that played great, old classic rock music. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I love the food there but I still feel like it's not really authentic. The environment was pretty good though, if you like khao San road or sukho Thai you'll love this place"}
{"text":"Closest thing to authentic Thai in the city. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If you like authentic Thai food and can handle spice, this is the place for you. My \"non-spicy\" dish was still kind of spicy to me and I didn't enjoy it so much. My companions (who are more partial to spice) thought their dishes were delicious though. Another thing worth noting is the decor of the restaurant is really unique. Cute and rustic! I'm excited to visit Pai's sister restaurant, Khao San Road."}
{"text":"I came here a couple days ago with two others. It was 6pm on Thursday and we didn't have to wait for a table (yay!). To share, we had the 'grabong' (deep fried squash fritters), and the 'khao pla tawt' (crispy basa fillets), both of which we loved. They had the perfect amount of crisp and weren't greasy at all. The 'khao soi' with braised beef was also really good. The curry sauce was very flavourful and we loved the texture of the fresh egg noodles. 

The papaya salad, however, was a disappointment. It was served deconstructive, as in the different components and ingredients were separated on one dish, and it made it difficult to eat and share with others. Also, the taste just wasn't right - everything was really raw and left an unpleasant bitter aftertaste. Maybe it was just me. I thought the other dishes and drinks made up for the salad though. The mango shake and cocktail with cucumber and gin stood out and complimented the heavy food well.

Besides being a busy place, the music really adds to the noise in the restaurant, making it really loud. Even though we were a small group of three it was hard to carry on a good conversation. Nevertheless, I'd still come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Get the Pad Gra Prow! That's all I have to say. Great service always satisfied coming here!"}
{"text":"Pregnant girlfriend and I both got mild food poisoning the next day after ordering takeout. Had chicken pad Thai and green curry. 

Don't know if we'll  risk it again.  Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"My absolute top pick for Thai food in Toronto. The atmosphere and decor reminds me of a bustling Thai food market, and the food is superb and very authentic Northern Thai cuisine (Thai girl here). It's always busy and I try to make a reservation online if I know a week in advance, or get there early (5ish) if going the same day, otherwise it's a 30-60 minute wait... still worth it though (go around the corner to underground El Caballito for a yummy pitcher of margarita to pass the time). My favourites are: Plah Nua (Beef Salad), Pak Boong Fai Deng (Morning Glory) and pork Pad Gra Prow."}
{"text":"My first experience here was on a Wednesday afternoon right before the Kinky Boots show in Alexandra theatre. The experience was so great that I instantly knew I'd found a good go-to Thai restaurant. 

The interior is bustling with life, with a Jamaican-Thai feel. They even have hooks on the posts beside the tables where you can hang your bag, jacket, or umbrella. It's pretty great!

The service here was exceptional. All the servers here were super down to earth and catered to my needs before I even realized my needs myself. Like one of the servers came and asked us if we needed chopsticks. I didn't know if they had chopsticks and the thought didn't even cross my mind so I'm happy he brought it up.

The beef noodle soup was SOOOO good and so flavourful. I'm probably not well-versed enough in the world of Thai food to be a dependable critic, but the soup tasted more than just salt and broth. It was delicious, and the beef was very tender. Also the portions were great for the price. I split the noodle soup and pad thai with my cousin and we hardly put a dent in the pad thai because we tried to finish all the delicious soup while it was still fresh.

Definitely will recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"On our trip to Toronto, we stopped here because it was somewhat near our hotel and had good reviews. We managed to get a spot at the bar-- try and make a reservation! It fills up fast and for good reason.

The service was wonderful and friendly. We both ordered the Pad Thai (no spice and mild, which had quite a kick!) and the Winter Dog, which was a great drink!

It's a little loud here, but not in a bad way. Just a lot of happy folks chatting. The food was delicious and the portion generous for the price. They take card. 

We'd for sure go again! Thanks for making our last dinner in Toronto a great one, Pai! :)"}
{"text":"Service is very slow and rough, food comes out slow.

Food is a bit too heavy and oily. Not sure why this is so overhyped."}
{"text":"I went to Pai last week and was quite impressed with the quality the meals.  I've been to Thailand a number of times, and Pai's is definitely authentic.  Making it even better, the prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are large, which explains why it was packed on a Tuesday night at 8:30p  I had the Gaeng Hunglay with ox tail, which was perfectly braised in a tasty curry sauce. As for the ambiance, it is casual although there is an eclectic mix of hipsters and suits.  

If I had to ding them a point - and this may be petty - it would be on the variety of the mains and the lack of off-menu specials.  Otherwise, I definitely recommend Pai - I'll be going back there again."}
{"text":"Very busy and hip Thai place in downtown Toronto. Great quality Thai food, good portions and very cool ambience (dim lighting and live colors)! Totally recommend their Pad Thai. 

You'd definitely need a reservation."}
{"text":"This may be the only Thai place I've eaten at which resembled a restaurant in Thailand. It's a treat."}
{"text":"Amazing food--probably the best Thai in the city, but their delivery has gone downhill steadily. We have been regular customers since it opened, and have dealt with them regularly giving us levels of spice we did not order (I get it, it happens, but it's pretty much every time now), but it has gotten to the point where they seem to want to push their customers away. I have yet to order without calling 30+ times (they have no call waiting; you have to hit redial until it works), but like i said, the food's so good, I will put up with that. The apps they have partnered with both do not offer the full menu, so we can't use them to order what we want. 

Tonight when we called, having ordered & received delivery SINCE IT BEGAN OFFERING the service, we were told rather rudely that their bike courier no longer will go to the intersection where we live, so we can't order delivery anymore. (we are less than half a block past the apparent cutoff). Let' just be clear, we live less than 2 km from the restaurant, so it's not like we're asking them to ship it up to North York.

I would think that if a loyal customer tells you they've been ordering from you repeatedly, you'd want them to continue patronizing your business, but I guess they're too good for that now. It's a shame, because the food is delicious, but customer service has to improve."}
{"text":"Good tasty food for takeout in the downtown core."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and it's a pretty nice place for dinner.  The ambiance is fun and the staff is friendly.  There are long wait times and they don't seem to take reservations, so be prepared to wait.  They have some good vegetarian options, however I do find the food can be a bit heavy.  But overall, a fairly good place."}
{"text":"Very nice and extremely busy place. I have no complain about the food. Only they don't take reservation, wish they accommodate that in the future."}
{"text":"Would be a 5, but I can't stand hipsters who think they are doing me a favour for serving me.  But very DELICIOUS, no complaints on the food!  Yummy, go here now!"}
{"text":"Pai is a lively spot on Duncan Street that focuses on dishes from Northern Thailand - the restaurant is named after the town of the same name north of the city of Chiang Mai. That means less emphasis on coconut-based curries and more on spicy ground meat dishes like laab and pad gra pow. If you want to taste just how nuanced Thai food can be (as opposed to simply being sweet), please go to Pai and order the laab salad or pak boon fai deng (morning glory wraps) or the classic northern Thai curry - Khao Soi. The flavours are complex, aromatic and as hot as you choose to handle.

The atmosphere is loud and busy, but not overbearing. The servers are friendly and fast. If you've ever been to Thailand, you'll feel at home in this place - it's decor reminds me of any number of charming bars, cafes and restaurants I visited when I travelled there."}
{"text":"A little bit too loud and hipster-y for my taste, but food was yummy. Portions seemed much smaller than sister restaurant Sukho Thai, and the spice level of some dishes was quite intense (the papaya salad made me cry and I can handle spice!)"}
{"text":"We got there around 6:30 on sat night without reservation. We were in line for about 30 min to put our names to the waitlst then it was another 20 min or so until we finally got our table. Definitely worth the wait but I'll make a reservation next time lol We ordered pad Thai and khao soi and they were both flavourful and delicious. I loved their iced thai tea as well!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once for two people before a Blue Jays game (around 5pm, I guess) and another time with a party of 4 for lunch around 12:30pm. Both times, my eating partners have said that their Pad Thai's were the best they had had (that includes the illustrious Khao San Road pad thai!). Two words: squash fritters. But it's a crying shame they don't serve them on the lunch menu! I've had Khao Soi and Panang Beef Curry. Both times the waitress suggested the Khao Soi, but I enjoyed the beef curry more. Chalk it up to personal preference. I tried one of my dining partners Pad Gra Prow and was also struck with irrational jealously. I got \"Foreigner Spicy\" both times, which basically confirmed that I will always be a foreigner, and I'm one to put Sriracha on most things. SO SPICE! Can't remember what mixed drink I got, but it had ginger beer and I could've drank about 5 of them. Service was on point. Both times we were thankful we didn't get seated at the kneeling table, which looked pretty painful for our late 20s year old backs."}
{"text":"The hype is real. Tried the Khao Soi and it was everything! Soulfully delectable food. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Hands down. Best Thai in Toronto thus far. We had the coconut green curry and chicken pad Thai, both medium spicy. Both dishes were amazing!! I particularly enjoyed the curry, which came inside a coconut bowl. The point is to scrape off the insides of the coconut by spoonfuls and devour along with the curry. Also, the portions were very good. 

In comparison to Khao San (which I also like!) Pai has a much larger seating space and scores higher on my favs list. I liked the food better here too. Also, the service was exceptional! 

Will be back soon. Way to go Pai!"}
{"text":"Always reliable for a good curry. And some coconut. Mm. My friend and I had just finished up a wine class at iYellow on Queen West and decided to try our luck for a table here on a Friday night. We were told a table would be roughly 20 minutes wait and decided to wait it out with a drink in the bar. 

I had to have one of the Thai iced teas. I was at Pai! If you've never had one, definitely get it. It's a large order. I never finish so I usually share with a girlfriend or something. 

We were offered two seats at the bar which was fine by us and got us food sooner rather than later. Service was decent. The staff checked up on us every so often (both behind the bar and the regular wait staff). 

I ordered the tofu pad Thai and my friend ordered the green curry in a coconut. The pad Thai wasn't spectacular but their curry was amazing as always. That definitely filled my Thai food craving for the next little while!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, nice atmosphere, food is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Great thai place in downtown. Similar to other Thai restaurants in the area, but they have more seating and I have never waited more than 20 minutes (vs. Khao San Road which can be an insane wait).

Ambiance is good, service is good. I pretty much always go for the house pad thai, it's great."}
{"text":"I arrived at around 4:30 to one other table in the restaurant. It was my first time here and we were seated promptly. 

I ordered the green coconut curry and my boyfriend had the pad gra prow. 

We've both been to northern Thailand and I can say that this place lives up to the flavours we had. 

Service was alright. Our server just came by to ask us for drinks then asked if we were ready. Never asked us if we had any questions or anything that could better our experience. 

We will be returning however."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely, mindblowingly AMAZING. So glad I never have to go back to Khao San Road ever again.  Loved the decor, the perfectly spiced green curry served in a carved out coconut and in particular, the mango sticky rice. Very authentic Thai food and wonderful, hospitable service."}
{"text":"Was there this summer and really enjoyed their food. Their pad Thai is delicious and any other dish I've tried was very good as well. Nice date spot. 

Pro tip... if you aren't drinking alcohol there is an alcohol free zone that is quicker to get a table for."}
{"text":"Found this delightful spot as I was meeting a business colleague for lunch who is both vegetarian and gluten free.  Chose the spot thanks to Yelp reviews.

Despite begin full with the lunch crowd, we arrived towards the end of the lunch hour and had a short wait.  Love the funky, diverse decor.

Service staff friendly, attentive to the right level and worked together as a team to serve us.  All appreciative. 

We both had versions of the Pad Thai.  Great to see that they customize the spiciness level to the tastes of the customer.  Mine could have been a bit more spicy.... now I know how the range works, I'll be able to order better.   My colleague had a nice selection of vegetarian options with ability to have it served gluten free.

Great flavours in the Pad Thai and servings size were great for a lunch.... not too much,  not too little.  

Will definitely go again to try other menu items."}

{"text":"Overpriced with loud music (club-atmosphere) so you can't hear anything you say. It's popular so they must be doing something right. I guess I'm old now."}
{"text":"Went there last night with some friends after  reading all these reviews.  By far the best thai food I have eaten in the city.  There was a 40 min wait time on a Friday night,  but there are bars in the area where you can grab a drink before that.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Waited in line for half hour here and khao San road, tried both Thai restaurant within 24 hours while visiting Toronto. Pai definitely beat khao San road!    

Khao San road is good, Pai is GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Taste like home! 

We ordered Pad Thai Shrimp, Somtam Tad, Kao Soi chicken, Sai ua and Tom Yum Kung Mor Fai. 5 happy dishes for 3 people.

Pad Thai here is not as saucy as ones at KSR but equally delicious: 
will def. go back :)"}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago with a friend and had the Moo Ping appetizer, Gaeng Kiaw Wan and Pad Gra Prow. The food portions were very good and the food itself were great as well. 

Service was a bit on the slower side but understandably so because it was pretty packed in the restaurant. That being said, definitely make reservations if you're going during busy times as there are almost always line-ups to be seated. 

I would for sure come back!"}
{"text":"Pai is probably my favourite restaurant in the area because their food is consistently on point. I usually come here for lunch with my co-workers on Fridays and it's always packed. We've had to leave a few times and find other inferior places to grab lunch because the line was too long. So try to go early or later if you want to beat the lunch crowd. 
    I've had the khao soi, pad thai and the pad gra pow. The Khao Soi is a really flavorful and creamy coconut milk curry with tender chunks of beef and curly egg noodles. I loved it but I wished it came with rice or bread instead of noodles because I wanted something starchy to soak up all the creamy spicy goodness. The Pad Thai is probably the best and most authentic you'll ever find in the GTA. Unlike most other Thai places, their Pad Thai noodles aren't covered in sweet red ketchup sauce. I like to get mine with chicken and shrimp. The shrimps are an extra $2 but it's so worth it - they're huge and succulent.  The Pad Gra Pow is a simple dish of stir-fried minced meat with basil on rice and topped with a sunny side fried egg. It's simple but satisfying. Again, get this with shrimp to bring this dish to another level. Yes, their shrimps are that good. I could just a eat a plate of their shrimps and be happy."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  We each sampled a main, I had the green curry which came in a coconut, and they were all very, very good.  The papaya salad is a great starter. 

The one drawback is that the drinks are quite expensive.  I asked the waitress if they had any smoothies (I'm a wimp when it comes to spice) and she recommended a mango something or other drink which comes served in a pineapple with a shot of alcohol.  While it was a very good drink she failed to mention the drink was $15!! 

We got there at 7:30 and the place was already packed with a long line.  make reservations if you can.

Would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Pai is cool as well as the fact that you can make reservations (unlike Khao San Rd), and the service is pretty good; however, I felt the quality and taste of food was poor overall. I should note though, that I am a vegetarian so I can only speak through that lens (however my partner ordered their chicken wings and was underwhelmed by the flavours). In general, there were limited options on the menu (small menu overall); there was one vegetarian option. The menu identified which dishes could be made vegan (only about 2-3), which was good and identified which dishes had oyster sauce (which was helpful so that I could avoid those!). I ordered 2 dishes that could be made vegan (green curry and khao soi). I felt the dishes we ordered lacked flavour and depth and the curries relied quite heavily on coconut milk/cream, which made the curries pretty thick in consistency. The vegetables in the dishes were cut into huge chunks and tasted pretty bland. I have had vegetarian thai food at other thai restaurants and the flavours can be pretty amazing even without the fish sauce. Taste is very important to me and I feel that this restaurant let me down and I did not enjoy my meal. I had high hopes for Pai, but felt the food quality and taste is much better at Khao San Road (even for a vegetarian!)"}
{"text":"Best thai food in the city! 
Cool vibe. Always busy. 
Favourite items:
-Tom Yum soup
-Gaeng Masaman with braised beef"}
{"text":"I am not a Thai expert, but I have had my share of thai food. This place was really fine, but not anything special for me. I played it pretty safe with Pad-Thai. I consider my meal a little bit on the small portion size. The flavor was fine, but my local thai restaurant is better. 
The service was a little on the slow side, but nothing really bad. I just feel like I can get better. There were a bunch of old american record albums on the wall where I sat, I thought that was a little weird for thai, but also interesting.
This place does get crowded so be prepared to wait at peak times.
Sorry, PAI keep working on it."}
{"text":"Food ****1/2
Service ****
Ambience *****

What can I say?  After wanting to go for more than a year, we stumbled upon an open reservation on a snowy Friday night. Really good decision"}
{"text":"My go to place for pad Thai. Hands down the best pad Thai in the city. Beats khao San road, suko Thai, Thai princess, salad king etc any day! Will have to come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pad thai in the city! Reasonably priced for fair portions. Their Thai Milk tea is also a must have! Heads up, their milk tea is really heavy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I've been a loyal fan of Chef Nuit (& Jeff!) since they opened up Sukhothai on Parliament steet, and I've been coming back for the Khao Soi noodle ever since. This is one of my go-to choices when I have friends visiting from out-of-town, because it's a perfect example of what makes Toronto such a great city to live in. Pai is authentic, diverse, delicious and fun. Plus, it's a family business that treats you like family."}
{"text":"Bottom line: great food a lil on the pricer side for the portion 

Food is great here, incl my favourite item kao soi beef. Altho the price is higher and quantity is smaller compared to my other favourites khao San road and sukhothai. 

Also I feel that they are rushing you out when you are done eating. Not so great if you want to sit down and has a relaxing chat. The sukhothai on Dundas west is your best bet for a dinner and chat kinda good time 

Solid 3.5 star in the heart of Toronto."}
{"text":"Flavours are more to my liking, compared to Khao San Road.

Waiting lines *seem* shorter."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend a few weeks ago and had a really great meal. It reminded me of being in a small bar in Thailand. This place is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Chicken Pad Thai is heavy on oil, light on flavour and way too sweet. I had to add vinegar to counter the sweetness and cut the oil.  Good portion size and amount of chicken though.  Too expensive for what it is, there are better Thai places in the city.
Final verdict: Over-hyped and over-priced."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We waited 45min for food, food is overpriced and they don't even have their liquor license yet but yet they still advertise beer for sale. Avoid this place!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best bar/reso combo in Toronto. Located in a half basement of a building, the atmosphere really pulls you in. The crowd looks and sounds like they are having the time of their lives, and why wouldn't they be? The food is amazing. I have at this point tried the entire menu, and you cannot go wrong with any option. The wings are great to start with, while the soup brings warmth. The food is so delicious with the meats being well marinated. My favorite dish is the coconut curry served in a coconut. Make sure to scrape the coconut for all the creme. The bar offers tons of variety as well. Bring your friends or your family either way you will have a blast."}
{"text":"Very flavourful food with interesting presentation.  Reasonable prices but serving size is on the smaller side.  Great place for pre theatre dinner but they are really busy and the kitchen can be slow getting out the plates because they are working on take out orders at the same time.  Service was efficient but be sure you let them know you have to be out in time for the theatre."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff. Can get very busy and noisy at lunch, but the wait is never too long. Once you're seated, the service is good and fast."}
{"text":"friendly relaxed service very chill attitude but you can see that they take their jobs seriously 5/5 service

The food was very declious and yummy. Many items I never thought I'd try but im glad I did. 

Ill definitely be back. I choose medium spicy thinking I could handle it... I could not lol. So for all you softies like me thinking you can handle medium.. I suggest you just stick with mild their spicy meter is higher than the usual place. XD"}
{"text":"I love the lunch menu. The set menu is a great deal! You can pick two items for a larger portion each or three items for a smaller portion each. It's great to try different dishes. Also, a warning, the street style noodles is SUPPOSED to be lukewarm. I was very confused when the dish came out as it was not hot but servers + other patrons have told me it's supposed to be that way."}
{"text":"Pai is one of those places I don't mind going to over and over again. The food is great, the vibe is chill, and service is decent. Overall, Pai is a go-to for a good dinner when I don't want fine dining but want some good food.

I usually, without fail, get - Thai Iced Tea, and the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef and/or the Khao Soi with chicken. Both dishes are bursting with flavour and texture. I would also recommend the Grabong as a starter; the fried squash fritters just go well with that dipping sauce. I will admit, I'm a fan of tamarind, which might explain why I enjoy the Grabong sauce and the Gaeng Masaman so much.

I have had some sub-par experiences with some of their other dishes, but as long as I'm ordering what I like, I always enjoy my time (and food) here. 

Overall, I would recommend Pai to anyone looking for a laid back, casual restaurant with delicious food bursting with flavours. It helps that the pricing isn't ridiculously expensive either."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I definitely will be a returning customer for a while. 
I came on for lunch and another time to get a grab and go meal and I'm always been satisfied by the overall customer service and food.
It's fairly new to me the type of cuisine but I'm falling in love.
Their pad Thai are great and also tried one of their beverages that one of my co-worker was talking about several times so I had to try it.
Definitely a place for me saved on my book marks.
Recommended, thanks guys."}
{"text":"Best Thai ever. You can order on the Maegan app; easier than getting a table and tastes just as good. I could eat their food ice cold it's delicious.

Favourite restaurant in To!"}
{"text":"Amazing Group Private Dining Event!!!

Every dish in family-style price fixe was delicious. The menu was reasonably priced for private dining. Pai is definitely my favourite Thai place and I'm a picky foodie! 

JJ, the manager was extremely helpful with my large holiday dinner of about 20 guests.
Pai accommodated some of my guests' tardiness when they arrived a bit late (some places give away your reservation if your entire party doesn't arrive within 15 minutes!). Even three guests that had an last minute emergency were excused (most private dining reservations charge a fee for no-shows). They even offered us separate bills which is extremely rare with large groups! I thought this was a wonderful gesture! They helped accommodate my guests with dietary restrictions/allergies (eg. Peanuts/Seafood/Pork/Vegetarian) and didn't charge deposit or require my credit card information unlike other private dining restaurants. There was so much food, we were all stuffed and everything was perfect. 

I cannot stress enough how great the experience and service was. I'll definitely be back and highly recommend a private dining event."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, and excellent ambiance."}
{"text":"Eh. It's okay. I was excited to hear about a new Thai restaurant, hoping that I could get in before the 2 hour lines started. The service is good enough. The decor was acceptable. The food is fine (I'll admit that the tum yum soup was quite tasty) but it wasn't so delicious that I have to go back again as soon as possible or ever again. If you get an opportunity to try it out, try it. If they tell you that there's a wait longer than your appetite can stand, go elsewhere. You won't be missing out on any musts."}
{"text":"So you think you like spicy, you got the stomach to handle it?  Pack a bag and come see Ron, they will leave to crying and praying for ice cream later.  Get the antacid and come over!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai restaurants. My go-to dishes include Khao Soi and Pad Gra Prow. This restaurant can get busy so be sure to make a reservation or go early. Has a very relaxed and casual ambience. Don't forget to try their Thai Ice Tea!"}
{"text":"Lately I've been into Thai food and PAI was just the best place I could find in Toronto for Thai food. During my first visit I ordered chef Nuit's pad Thai  with some lemongrass Iced tea. the grabong is a must try too. A couple of times after that the food hasn't been as awesome as it was the first time but I still really like this place. The chef and her husband are super nice and make you feel super comfortable and they have done up to please really well too, making it very welcoming for guests. Prepare in advance to wait in the line because it's always really busy. It's a reasonable restaurant and beats Khao San road anyday!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambience. Looks great on the inside. Tried the satay chicken and Chef Nuit Pad Thai with shrimps in super spicy (level 4 I think). We got there and there was no line-up. It was a Sunday at around 5. Line-up started just a few minutes after we got there. Service was great too. Didn't wait long for the food even though the place was packed."}
{"text":"Great food, and great ambiance... After an hour here, totally felt like I would be stepping out onto a busy streets of Bangkok after this looking for my regular tuk tuk... Try the beef salad, the meat is pe factory tender and flavourful."}
{"text":"For those who liked Khao San Road and Sukho Thai, this place should definitely be on top of your list! The food is incredible & authentic. I recommend the Pad Gra Prow, Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut) and the Khao Soi. You cannot leave without trying the mango on sticky rice! This place is worth the wait but try to go on a weeknight to minimize wait times. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the space is quite unique and roomy. I'm just shy of giving it 5 stars because the service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 stars for amazing Thai food, friendly faces, bustling hot atmosphere. I've come back mainly because I was so impressed with the food. It's pricier and portions aren't huge, but this is balanced by high quality food and taste. 

Food:
Not sure what more my review might add to what's already been said, but the food here is among the best Thai I've had in Toronto.

I started off with the chicken skewers (Gai satay) and they were amazing. The skewers were very tender, juicy and flavourful.

I tried their Pad Gra Prow in both pork and crispy pork. Personally I really preferred the crispy pork. It was crunchy, juicy and tender. The egg came put perfectly and the rice was delicious. 

I tried both the Goeng Klaw Wan (curry in a coconut and the Goeng Masaman (red curry). What stood out most to me was how rich each curry was. It was full bodied and creamy. I found myself tremendously impressed with the food. Medium spicy was fine by the way. 

Service:
This is a bit of a difficult topic. They are very busy and popular. They try their best to accommodate but because of the traffic, I found that while the faces were friendly, it was hard to find my server. Getting drinks or refills was difficult because it's very noisy, and the waiters/waitresses are constantly on the go. 

Ambience:
I love the decor. It's very spacious inside. There is loud upbeat music playing. This is not the kind of restaurant you want to go to for a quiet conversation. You will find yourself using your outdoor voice to communicate. The patio might be a better option for conversation."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks, especially the green Thai curry, presented really well in a real whole coconut. It is hard to go wrong with any food order choice. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Toronto!!"}
{"text":"As I told my friend, this place looks like a \"living in your mom's basement in the 90s\" joint - and that's OK. The music is loud and the atmosphere is lively, so don't come here for a quiet candlelit dinner. Had a good time with a friend. The yam fritter starter was massive. The pad thai was ho-hum, but I enjoyed the spice level. My friend loves the khao soi here."}
{"text":"Great menu with tasty dishes and reasonable prices. The place is just too crowded though. I guess that's the nature of the neighbourhood on a Friday night.  There were people lining up in the cold to get in and the staff were overwhelmed. The decor and atmosphere are chic, but almost bordering on pretentious - perhaps also a reflection of the neighbourhood. 

If you like loud and chaotic and want to feel like you're in a nightclub, you may enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The service and food were great. Our server filled up our water and explained menu choices clearly. The host was polite despite being very busy and without a reservation he assured us that we would have a table within 40 minutes or he would send a text if earlier. The atmosphere was warm and despite it being at full capacity, the waiters were very calm. We ordered one traditional Thai rice dish with a fried egg on top and one pad Thai dish to share. The portions were large enough that we were satisfied at the end. Would recommend. However, make a reservation or be willing to wait at least 30 minutes if you walk up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super fun atmosphere with awesome dishes. Gets very busy though, so make a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"I came to Canada for my first time because of a wedding and found a single reason to return to Toronto for the best Thai food I've ever had! Pai Thai delivered beyond expectation! The green curry, fried rice, egg noodle dish, beef salad and mango sticky rice all excellent!"}
{"text":"PAI
A different change of scenery - warm, romantic countryside - from Khao San and Sukhothai without any compromise on the street style . Our server was lovely. It was a great spot to chill on some Singha's which was followed by a challenge with the unfinished wooden washroom latch that really made me feel like I was in a place away from the city. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"Spring rolls and Tom Yum Soup...the perfect lunch. I ordered medium spice and it was certainly on the hotter side. The place is funky and authentic. Will be back"}
{"text":"Best Best Thai food in the city! Every dish is excellent. Just try to get a table early or between peak hours otherwise you'll have to wait."}
{"text":"Good food though quite casual and difficult to get a reservation. Good that there are vegan options, and would be better if there were more still."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I was in Thailand in November and the flavours of the food here brought me back. I went on a Thursday night at 8:30 and it was packed with people. The wait for a table was 1 hour! But hearing so much about this place I was willing to stick around. Next time, I definitely need to look into making a reservation.

The food: 
Thai iced tea was nice big cup and just the right sweetness. We ordered a papaya salad which the flavors were spot on but only wish was there was more salad and less of the fried pork skin and noodles around it. Next was the Sai ua (northern thai sausage). Not as spicy as Thailand which is great but flavours were the same. Came with a side of veggies and sticky rice. Usually called nim prik where you take pieces of the veggies and eat it with the chilli dip. This dish was good but I think for the 8 slices of sausage it was a little $$. Lastly, we got khao soi and it was good. The curry soup was nice and creamy, the egg noodles were perfectly cooked and the crunchy noodles on top completed the perfect combo.

The service:
I had no issues with the service. Our server was very nice and gave us recommendations. We didn't have to wait too long for our food. And they came back often enough to check on us.

I am definitely going back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"One of my friends suggested that we have a dinner at this place as they offer excellent Thai cuisine. As soon as I got here at around 6 pm, I was first pleased with their exciting and fun decoration, then the friendly greeting and services from the staff members.

I was surprised to hear that they were fully booked on early Tuesday evening, but my friend and I didn't mind the bar seats as it was spacious and clean. 

We both got Khao Soi, which had great curry flavor with creamy texture. I really enjoyed the dish, and would recommend this place to any of my friends. I almost feel like they deserve 5 stars, but I'm settling with 4 because the place can be quiet noisy without any loud music playing in the background. It definitely would be a fun place to come with a large group of friends, or a date who you don't mind sitting very close to."}
{"text":"One of the best Tai restaurant that I have tried here in Toronto. I tried their tom yum soup and it was so delicious and warm. Also, the green curry in the coconut was delicious."}
{"text":"I doubt I can say anything about this place that others haven't already. Great atmosphere, great food, a bit limited selection if you're vegetarian, but that's the nature of authentic Thai cuisine. If you get the green curry during lunch they serve it in a coconut! Don't forget to eat the \"meat\" of the coconut after!"}
{"text":"Although the wait was long (50mins) the food and service were worth it. My bf and I were recommended this place by a friend and we absolutely fell in love (we're obsessed with Thai food) the wait was long, so I recommend making a reservation. However, within the wait time we walked around and I stopped at a store on Queen street. 
We ordered the chicken skewers & spring rolls as appetizers.. THE BOMB 
And for mains, pad Thai for me and khao soi for my bf.
The waiter was great too! 
The ambiance was lively and very 'hip'"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai places in the city.  We tried the Khao Soi and the Gaeng Masaman with Braised beef.  Both were a perfect blend of spicy, savoury and sweet.  My only thing that I didn't like was both were lukewarm, that might be how it should served but I would of preferred it warmer."}
{"text":"My best friend owns a Thai restaurant so I am very picky when it comes to thai food. I have also been to Khao San Road and Pai is still one of my faves.  I have been here several times and am never disappointed. I've tried the Masaman, Green Curry, Grabong, Pad thai, Chicken Satay, Khoa Soi and  Thai Ice Tea. All so good and definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday evening (6pm).

Atmosphere/decor, I find the decor a bit odd, almost hodge podge.  It may be due to how little I know about what Thailand looks like, but the decorations just seem a bit random and odd to me.  Exposed brick, random pennants in the ceiling, Bob Marley playing in the background.  The seating is a bit tight, so, do expect to hear your neighbours unless you are in the high tables off to the side.

Food, ordered the grabong (I thought they were okay, but our tastes mostly of batter, I did like the sauce which was sweet and a little bit spicy), pad thai (I can't really comment on this, we ordered medium spicy and it was a bit more spicy than expected, tastes like pad thai that I'd had at many other thai restaurants, nothing amazing), and the green curry (decoration is interesting, although because it is in a coconut, it doesn't hold that much so they bring out more curry in a small bowl, seems a bit odd, I thought the curry was good though).  Also got a thai beer and a thai ice tea which I thought was interesting (this is my second time having one and it tastes sweet with a lingering bitterness at the end) but do note that there is a LOT of ice in the cup, so even though it is big, you don't actually get that much.

Service, they seemed pretty attentive to us, no issues with them coming timely to take our order, ask for our opinion on the food and refill drinks as well as taking away our dishes when finished.

Cost, for two drinks, two mains, and one appetizer, it cost us roughly $60 which I think is a bit much for thai food, but when I compare it to nearby offerings, it is within range.

I don't see myself coming back here, although I may not understand and appreciate thai food as much as others do."}
{"text":"Amazing food, terrible service.
Keep coming back for the incredible food, but one waitress in particular is just awful. 
Recommend the khoi soi and Thai ice tea.
Food is 5/5 every time I've been here (three times).

Worth the wait for the food.
The waitress was so awful today I had to write this review. Asked for my food to be packed up and she threw a take out box on the table and walked away. Paid the bill and tipped and didn't even get any \"thank you\" or small talk. In fact, she never came by to ask how anything was even once. Hopefully she gets her shit together."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Very fresh ingredients, prepared to perfection. Staff did a great job, from the beginning to the end. No complaints whatsoever, and no recommendation for how they could make it better."}
{"text":"I came here for a work event and got to embark on Chef Nuit's Northern Food Trek. For the next 3 hours, I ate course after course of mind-blowing Thai food. Gai satay. Mountains of squash fritters. Papaya salad with fresh lemongrass. Perfectly deep fried spring rolls. Pad Thai so good you can't stop eating it even though you were full half an hour ago.   Green coconut curry that'll make you reconsider everything you've ever eaten before. And the sauces. So many tasty sauces to go with everything. And to end it off, fresh coconut sorbet. So save yourself the trip to Thailand and go eat everything here instead.*

* You should still go to Thailand. It's fantastic. Just a tad far away for food."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant in the downtown core. Very busy during lunch hours but the wait isn't long. Very interesting drink menu with good use of Asian flavours."}
{"text":"got the pad thai and green curry. came in a coconut which was cool. extracted coconut jelly from it. service was slow. atmosphere was nice. will come back for sticky rice."}
{"text":"this place is so crazy busy popular, but it's worth the wait. I like that they text you when your table is ready. The thai-inspired sangria was really tasty and I plan on recreating it so I can enjoy it at home. The food did not disappoint. Would recommend."}
{"text":"An amazing establishment run by owners who are actually very genuine and passionate about bringing quality Thai food to this city. If you're wondering why Khao San Road isn't the same as before, it's cause these owners left and started Pai. Now I'm craving Thai food....."}
{"text":"I never write a review... ever! However, I felt like I had to write one after tonight's experience. It wasn't my first time at Pai and the 30min wait (at 8.00pm) to get a table did not come as a surprise. For those who haven't eaten here, there is a reason why people are ready to wait... The food is that good! Yet tonight was unusual, there were a few hiccups with our order. The food was subpar and ingredients were missing. Since we were seated at the bar, the bartenders were taking care of us... if the food usually gets the big rave, well this post is all about the service! The bartenders were very accommodating and did everything to make sure we'd come back.  Trust me, we will. In fact, we're already planning to try out their new restaurant, kiin!!"}
{"text":"A different take on the standard Thai food we've all come to love. Northern Thai is an appropriate description as there is certainly crossover with Burmese cuisine. Saw some veggies go to another table- so we asked for the same. Marigold. Nice crunch and nice to have veggies with all the carbs we've been eating lately. Coconut water was fresh. Didn't have any of the mixed fruity drinks, but they certainly looked delicious if you are in the mood for that. The place has a fun tropical dive bar atmosphere - good for happy hour or a night out!"}
{"text":"Was there for a NY celebration and had a great time! 

Perfect atmosphere, great food at a reasonable price and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to say it - I thought this place was better than Khao San Road. Equally tasty food, speedier delivery of the meals, bigger portions, more comfortable and visually appealing interior setting, better prices, and -oh yes - no one-hour wait for a table. In fact, we waltzed right in and were eating our delicious meals within fifteen minutes of walking through the doors. (This was at 5pm on a Thursday)

I had the Pad Thai with tofu at the 'foreigner' (lol) level of spiciness and, I must say, the spice level was absolutely spot on. I'm always wary of the variation in spice levels between restaurants, but the 'foreigner' level was just PERFECT for me personally. It had a decidedly hot kick to it, but one that allowed all the other flavours to come through in a nice balance, something that I suspect may not have been achieved at the ultimate level of spiciness in this restaurant (Thai Spicy).

My Pad Thai was delicious, and very generous in the ratio of tofu, veggies and  peanuts to noodles. In fact, I think this was one of the few Pad Thais I've ever had that had that crunchy, nutty texture to it - everywhere else I've been seemed to skimp on the nuts a bit and left the sauce and noodles lying in a vaguely slimy mess. I really noticed the crunchy difference here and would definitely try this dish again upon my next visit. The portion was huge, and more than half was taken away in a container for the next days' lunch. 

Soft drinks were served in pint size glasses (great value) and the tap water came in a bizarre tumbler that made a tweety-bird noise as you poured it! 

Only downside was the service. Although our orders were taken quickly and food delivered fresh to the table within minutes, we were waiting what seemed like an eternity for the bill after we requested it. This was a bit stressful as we were in a hurry to be elsewhere after our meal and almost ended up being late. Also, neither the host nor the server cracked a smile or uttered a 'thank you' or anything remotely civil during our whole stay. This was disappointing as the restaurant was far from busy at the time, so it was a bit of a bummer to see such miserable staff.

In terms of the food and attractive setting though, this place is an easy five stars. I will return, despite the crankiness."}
{"text":"Great phad thai and pad gra pow (essentially meat on rice - soo tasty!). Kao soi was a bit rich for my taste but most people really like it. Gets very busy at lunch and dinner so make a reso!"}
{"text":"The first thing attracted me is the overall decoration. It is so exotic and cute. The staff is nice too.
Ordered khao sai and mango steaky rice.
The khao sai is good overall. The curry is \"dense\" I would say. You tell they put a lot of effort in it. But I don't like the chicken, kind of dry.
The mango steaky rice is amazing, super awesome. Come in a nice display. The rice is still a little warm, blend well with the mango.
Nice place to go for tai food."}
{"text":"Wish I could review this place. They don't take reservations and who can afford to wait a half hour for a table and probably another half hour to eat when you're hungry. 
Tried eating here when it was Khan San Road. The same thing."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Khao soi is life! I've only had the food takeout via Ritual but it travels well and tastes flavourful and hot still"}
{"text":"The food was alright, nothing amazing. I was even a little disappointed considering the high reviews on yelp. The environment was very loud, too loud to have a conversation."}
{"text":"If you are craving Thai food, look no further! Nothing beats the Pad Thai here. I typically get the Chicken Pad Thai medium spicy with a side of hot sauce so I can add more spice to it if I want. 

Another must is the squash fritters. They are basically deep fried squash fries. There is a saucy that comes with it. 

I really like the decor of the restaurant. You feel like you are in a Thai market. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving Thai food."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place I've ever been to. Period. The food is INCREDIBLY good; the portions fill you up even if you only have a few bites, since it's so dense with flavor. The servers are prompt and friendly; we had multiple servers check with us if our meal was going well, and they were all very nice. The food came very shortly after we ordered it, and boy was it good. I recommend the Thai Iced Tea- basically the sweetest black tea you can imagine, except it's orange. Delicious."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Toronto (and would even say it's one of my favourite restaurants now).  The interior is awesome, service is great and food is so full of flavor. Tried chef nuit's pad Thai, khao soi and the squash fritters so far. Will definitely be back to try some more."}
{"text":"I was looking for good Thai place for several years. And I finally found it. The food is beyond Amazing! In relation to price especially this is as good as can be!"}
{"text":"good and authentic thai food. Service isn't great because of the downtown location and busy lunch hour, but food makes up for it."}
{"text":"To sum it up...

Try to book a reservation, because this place is JAMMED PACKED! And you must try the thai iced tea. It was amazing!

The pad thai was very good but it tasted like any other. The curry was good, it was very rich and creamy. 

The atmosphere is absolutely great here and the server we had was amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant was crowded and noisy. The tables were packed so closely that I was falling over other diners while maneuvering to my seat.

I ordered spring rolls and pad thai with chicken. The spring rolls were factory. and thoroughly cooked, but the pad thai hurt my eyes.  It hurt my eyes looking for the chicken. I found two small pieces. Lots of tofu, though, which I didn't order and don' eat.  

Halfway through the meal, a large party came to sit to the table next to ours and took turns trying to knock us out of our seats as they attempted to get into theirs.

It is cheap, though. but that did not make up for the other disappointments.

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything was so good! The lines are crazy and it's not the most fanciest looking restaurant but I'm okay with that. Def worth the visit. I keep thinking about it after."}
{"text":"Finally tried Pai. Went there on a Friday night after seeing how long the lines were at Khao San Road... Pai had a line up too, but it moved pretty fast. 
We ordered the Papaya Salad, Pad Thai and the Massaman curry. Everything lived up to the hype, but what really stood out for me was the som tum.. the portion is tiinnny, but it is SO damn delicious, I wish they'd serve a bigger portion of it so I could make a meal of just the salad. 
Also, their drink made with gin, lychee juice, mint and a bunch of other stuff is the perfect summer cocktail."}
{"text":"Simply awesome Thai food and great interior.   This is a MUST for anyone looking for authentic Thai food downtown.   Probably perfect."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the food here was INCREDIBLE! Very relaxed, fun vibe inside. Great service. The restaurant catered to my food allergies. Will definitely go back! One tip: Definitely make a reservation; we went for an early lunch on a Saturday and the place was already teaming with people!"}
{"text":"Delicious flavorful food, friendly staff, fun cozy environment! Very busy, get there early if you don't feel like waiting."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the few Thai restaurants I've been to over the course of years. From my undergrad days in Ottawa, and currently in the GTA.

A friend of mine who's a big foodie had suggested this place, and we decided to go to this place. Mind you, my friend has been here before, and if he had not recommended it, I wouldn't have agreed. I also do trust his judgement, so that is something to make note of. I ended up driving from work which is in Aurora, and I could definitely say that it is worth the 1 hour and 45 minute drive on a Thursday evening in rush hour traffic on the 404/DVP. 

Parking is no problem, as there is ample parking nearby, and I definitely recommend the Impark parking as its multi level, safer and not shady. A $7 flat rate is what you pay in the evening on a weekday. 

We went to the restaurant, and at first, I enjoyed the fact that instead of traditional restaurants, you either walk up the stairs, or no stairs at all, however we had to walk down the stairs. From what I could tell the place was pretty packed, and this tells you something. The food and service has to be excellent, for it to be crowded and packed inside. The ambiance was a bit hip, and I did not mind it at all. We had to wait 15 minutes for our table, and eventually we sat down.

The waitress was very friendly, and ensured that we were well taken care off/looked after, however I did notice after paying that I was charged full price for an appetizer, where we instructed her that we will split the appetizers. One of the other appetizer was split 50/50 on the bill. Never mind, that is my fault for not spotting it on the get go. I don't mind too. 

My friend and I ordered the Gai Satay, Grabong for the appetizers, and for my main course, I ordered the vegan dish - Pad Pha Hett. It is not on their online menu, but from what I could recall, it contained steam rice, snow peas, bamboo shoots, peppercorn, ginger, red pepper, red curry and another vegetable or two. To place the order, we only had to wait 10 minutes. 

After waiting for 5 to 10 minutes, the Gai Satay came. At first, I was a bit surprised. Usually when food comes out that quick, it tells you one thing - it was rushed, and it won't taste great. Or so as Gordon Ramsay so eloquently puts it. However, I was wrong. It tasted great, and no I am not factoring in that I was hungry heh. The sauce that it came with was a perfect combination. For $11 there were 5 pieces of the Gai Satay. My friend was kind enough to let me have the last piece. After having the Gai Satay, few minutes after, the Grabong came. This is the squash fritter if I am not mistaken. At first, I thought it was the thin fries, and after having a taste, it was like sweet potato fries, yet tasted even better. I wasn't sure if I could taste the squash, but in the end, it still tasted pretty good. The portion size was just perfect for two people to share. Finally the Pad Pha Hett came. The portion size yet again was perfect. The spices, flavour, smell definitely got my senses and taste buds going. I could definitely taste the pepper corn and enjoyed the dish thoroughly, to the point that I wiped my plate clean XD I was tempted to lick the plate, but there was a couple sitting right beside us, and I did not want to show that I am animal or a pig when it comes to eating food. I made sure to restrict my male instincts, unlike my ancestors. 

Overall I would definitely recommend this place, and for the price paid its definitely worth it. So to you all there who live far, its definitely worth it, even though you are not in the Downtown area, definitely make a trip to this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Favourite Thai in Toronto. Crazy about their pad gra prao. I daydream about it! So good!!!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets! The gra bong is to die for. Not cheap but very worth it."}
{"text":"Really nice Thai restaurant. Please make sure you call in advance because it is reaaally busy. Affordable and tasty dishes."}
{"text":"The holy grail of flavorful, spicy Thai food in Toronto. Since my first visit to Pai, I have made it a point to eat food from here at least once a month. A place of culinary delight with a variety of options and spice levels that will tease and tickle your taste buds. Pai is usually always packed because the food is so good. My personal favorites are the Massaman Beef Curry and the Pad Thai (Thai Spicy). The excellent service and upbeat atmosphere goes very well with the mouth watering food."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night- we are on vacation in Toronto from the States. It was really packed when we arrived at 6 pm. But- we got in right away to the Thai seating. The fried squash with tamarind sauce was very good and very unique- I've never seen that anywhere else. I ordered the Pad Thai- it was very good. I've had comparable in the States- but nonetheless it was delicious. I got foreigner spicy- I could have done Thai spicy. I would recommend this place- I've heard it is advantageous to make reservations and I would agree. I think we got lucky to get seated so quickly."}
{"text":"Really love this place.  It's very similar to Khao San Road, but without the long lines. Love the decor here. Great for large groups or date night. Already planning our next trip here."}
{"text":"I love their pad thai and wings. And coconut water. 

The pad thai was delicious. I don't see how you could say otherwise. There was nothing I could hate about the dish - it had deep herbal fragrance, spicy, hints of sweet, sour, salty and savoury.

The wings I had were a kind of dry rub with a very delicious thai sweet/spicy sauce that tasted very homemade and delicious. Like the pad thai, the flavour had depth to it. 


There are a lot of Asian places where the food might be good, but lacking in nuance and extra care in the taste. At Pai it's definitely present."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar, ordered a green curry with chicken. Took all of 15 mins to get ready. It came out in a coconut, and there was more in a separate bowl, explaining in a fantastic thai accent \"it would not be fair if just coconut bowl\". So a great portion. 

This sounds ridiculous, but I've tried green curries all over the world - including across Thailand. Pai does justice to authentic thai food. If you really like spice you can cope with \"very spicy\" - they Candianize the spice level. Overall 4 stars.

Service was great as well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Thai in the middle of Toronto! Didn't wait too long for a table and the food was awesome! Amazing atmosphere and excellent service made it an excellent late night quick bite on our first night in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food with amazing servers!! The menu was filled with different dishes that everyone can enjoy. I cant eat no pork nor shrimp but in Pai they have multiple dishes that suite my needs. The server we got was Jason and he's amazing!!! My sister knows him personally so he hooked us up with dessert. Jason was very informative and knew all the dishes as well as gave his personal opinion on certain foods he likes. The atmosphere had a chill vibe with some cool indie pieces. The restaurant was situated \"underground\" and near a cool district with lots of other cool restaurants. 

Food,
I went for the vegetable spring rolls as a starter and boy oh boy it was very tasty. The dipping sauce it came with was a winner. The roll was your typical vegetable spring roll with a hard crispy breaded coating that delivers an incredible taste. 

Next is the main appetizer, I got the Chicken Pad Thai in medium. Slightly disappointed because I expected it to be a bit more spicy but nonetheless it was still tasty!  Not your typical pad thai for sure. Generally I dont finish food from other restaurants but Pai was an exception. Every bite I took from the pad thai made me want to get another. The portion you get was massive, enough to feed two but if you're really hungry then this should be a good size portion. 

Lastly the dessert, I'm saddened to think, I actually forgot the name of the dessert but if your Filipino it was a twist on suman. The dessert was sticky rice but it had a sweet taste to it. The taste wasn't a sweet overpowering dessert it was quite subtle. It had mango on top. 

Overall Pai is the best Thai food i've ever ate in my life. If you need to impress someone or need a place to eat, make sure to check out this place. Dont forget to ask if Jason could serve you, he's awesome! Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place, but slightly disappointed overall.

For a start, the service was great and our waiter was very attentive. Appetisers wise, we ordered the squash fritters, the chicken wings, and a starter bowl of tom yum soup. The chicken wings were amazing, and I especially liked that the tom yum soup was slightly sweet instead of being too sour like it is at most places. The squash fritters were tasty, but the portion was huge - way too much for 2 persons, and more suitable for a party of 4 or 5. 

For mains, we ordered the green curry in a coconut and the basil pork. The green curry was great, but we waited about 30 minutes for it. We also specifically requested it to be served piping hot, but to our disappointment, the curry arrived to our table at room temperature. This was the same for our tom yum soup, which was unfortunate. The basil pork was good, but I have definitely had better. 

Sangria was great - refreshing and tasty. The Thai iced tea was way too sweet, but not too bad. 

Restaurant had a trendy, eccentric hipster vibe, and was overall not a bad dining experience. More towards a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Perfect yummy Thai food. Love the food here especially the Pra Grow crispy pork rice dish.  They also have a take out counter at the back of the restaurant with daily specials and limited seating! Will be back to try that out next time."}
{"text":"Chef Nuit Regular... you make real Thai food like no other Thai restaurant in Toronto. Tried Khao San on 11 Charlotte street and I'm never going back. Please please never change the recipe to your dishes."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe how good this place is. 
If you like Thai food, you will absolutely love this place. Have had almost everything on the menu and have loved it all. 
Great atmosphere, great service and the best food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always packed--generally a good sign. The early bird gets the worm; try to arrive before 5 if you'd like to avoid the long wait for a table. The spring rolls, green curry, and pad thai are all deliciously satisfying and rich in flavour. This is probably the best Thai food in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"An unusual hipster experience not always associated with a Thai restaurant. The staff were very attentive, courteous, and pleasant. I like that they take reservations. Portion sizes were good as well. We ordered 3 dishes between the 3 of us and shared comfortably. 



Medium heat in the pad Thai is not that spicy. Manageable but not too much heat. The mango drink is very refreshing as the weather warms up. 

My only criticism really is with the price point. My friends and I have tried Thai food in many cities and even in Thailand - but pad Thai for $14 is a bit much. Not to mention green curry at $16.

Take a moment to soak in the ambience with so many details to soak in!"}
{"text":"Really good Bloody Mary (goes by a different name) and short rib massaman was great. Cool little spot and good food. They lost a star for slight lack of authenticity and  spice heat levels which were laughable (medium has no heat whatsoever, definitely catering to a non-spicy palate)"}
{"text":"Ok We're on this fabulous road trip into Toronto, our first trip there , after wondering this magnificent city , like any good tourist we got Hangry yes Hangry, my first officer \"#1\" my lady Deli , whips out her \"tricoder\" and begins to break down a comprehensive analysis of the area granting us many choices of restaurants of which seem to be a lot in Toronto . She immediately zoned in on Pai . So coordinates lock we went ... warp factor 1 and a half left foot, right foot blammm there's a line coming out of the place , a line . Now we're from planet Brooklyn a line usually means \"ain't nobody gots time get dat\" but ... we waited. We got inside they politely gave us a buzzer and escorted us to the bar to wait for our seats   Before we could settle bebeep , wait time 15 mins , we thought fo sho it would be like 35-  45 min wait . They got points for that . Nothing like realizing you don't have to wait , cause damn we Hangry , we sat , we ordered and we ate and loved the entire experience . The music was dope, I'm olskool they was pumping Buju and Shabba , the flavor and ambiance was very Brooklyn 90's chic shon' I felt at home . We ordered the chicken satay which was delicious and flavorful, a lot softer then I like my chicken satay but it was yummy and it had a very homed cooked feel to it , my main course was the Khai soi I had it with the shrimp, delicious flavorful beautiful coconut milk curry with egg noodle nom nom . Again that Home cooked Thai food feel . Now the whole time we've been there there had been a line outside the door and that was about a little over an hour. As we left a patron asked how was the meal?  yaddadyadda , we told him it was awesome , during our exchange I noticed he was one of the people in a picture , a collage of photos telling the story of Pai I mistakenly thought that he was the son of the owner, only to find out that he was the owner , mega bonus point my friend , you work with your people and care about it with passion , I  bow to you sir amazing place you've created .
, we will return now please bring Pai to Brooklyn , I'll help you . On the reals!!! Now I'll let my first officer Deli debrief you ... i'm going to make this real simple; The wait was short, the ambience was great, the food was amazing, 1st mate and Captain very happy.  Best day ever!!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for pad gra prow (basil chicken on rice with a fried egg) ever since I had it from a street stand in Thailand. This is the first place that I've been able to find it in Toronto and it is just as good and authentic as I remember. I highly recommend this dish. 

Pad thai - Pai's version of pad thai not a favourite of mine. I think it lacks the tangy tamarind that I prefer (although maybe it's more authentic this way)

Green curry - good curry with the added bonus of being served in a coconut. Be sure to scrape out and eat the coconut meat when you're done.

While this place is often packed (my friend and I went at around 6PM and we still had to wait about 10min for seats at the bar), the staff are friendly and take the time to make good recommendations.

Having been to local favourites such as Khao San Road, Sukhothai and Salad Kind as well, I have to say that Pai wins as my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant has such friendly service. Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders to the wait staff greeted us with genuine smiles on their faces. The drinks were very interesting and tasty concoctions. One had vodka and lychee, another had Thai tea and cocoa powder. If you love Thai or are new to Thai this restaurant will not disappoint. My husband had Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork. Total comfort food. Anything topped with a fried egg is a winner! I had green curry in a coconut. Curry was yummy and I also found myself snacking on the coconut itself!

The restaurant is a bit cramped but the service was outstanding and made up for that. If you come before 6:30 the wait is not too bad at all. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to give it a try last week, we went right when they open, luckily we went so early... shortly after we order the line up begins.

The restaurant definitely brings back the memory of Bangkok street eats, it was very lively at a comfortable level.

A few of us got three types of curries... all was amazing! Except the green curry, as the bamboo shoot overpowered the whole dish. 

Tried the Thai tea cocktail... not a fan! Tasted more like coffee, regular Thai tea is good but a bit too heavy, I think Basil Box has a lighter but more frequent Thai tea 

Overall, will definitely return if I feel authentic Thai eats, but it is on the heavier side"}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently. Good food, good service, left happy. Nothing in my mind that truly stuck out as fantastic, but no complaints either."}
{"text":"amazing food!  Incredibly helpful staff.  I booked their family style room for a birthday party and they couldn't have been more helpful.  The food was amazing, the staff was amazing, the chef came out to chat with us - they accommodated our many food quirks - really fantastic!  Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The ambiance and food is always a hit! The service can use some sprucing up. I'm vegetarian and so there's usually less options anywhere I go, but they've offered to make dishes vegan a couple a times which I appreciate very much!"}
{"text":"Ditto to all the great reviews . Love this place, love that it is run by some same staff from Khao San Road. Food is wonderful. We always try to get there early ( by 5:30pm ) to avoid the huge line up. This is our go-to restaurant for great Thai food and a wonderful dinner experience."}
{"text":"it's a place where u can drink and eat Thai food. Very good atmosphere, food is great."}
{"text":"Good food and ambience is also good.
Both quantity and quality is good.
for official lunches its a good option to go out with your team."}
{"text":"We came here just before noon during TIFF and got a table right away. By just after noon the place was packed. The service was really good. Each staff member that passed our table checked to see that we were ok. We had our 11 month old, so we asked for a bowl of hot water to heat up her baby food which they brought right away with an extra plate and glass of water. They look like hipsters but definitely don't have the attitude. 

I couldn't help but order Khao Soi with beef which I have had from Sukothai many times. It came assembled in a beautiful clay bowl. The beef was in large tender pieces and there were lots of noodles in the rich soupy broth. It is a winner, but I will try something different next time.

I also had the Thai ice tea, which tasted like a delicious, thin milkshake. It was bright orange with lots of crushed ice and and was made with sweet condensed milk. 

Pai is a great choice for a quick lunch downtown."}
{"text":"Yelp states that they closed at 10:30pm. My wife and i take an uber to restaraunt and arrive before at 8:45pm. When we show up, there is a sign outside saying they will stop serving food at 9:30. When we get to the host, he refused to seat us saying that they were closing early for their \"company party\". I explained that we just paid for an uber to try their food while we were on vacation from the states, but the host could care less. We could of easily sat and ordered food before 9:30 (I saw about 2 to 3 empty tables). I guess the staff cared more about themselves and getting people out of the restaurant so they can turn up and get wasted. Very bad experience. Can someone explain the logic in closing early and turning away customer's to celebrate an anniversary party? The purpose of a business is to please customers and make money, not the opposite."}
{"text":"After reading raving reviews about Pai, my partner and I decided to give this a try on a cold weekday afternoon.

We arrived right when they opened and was promptly seated, and boy, did the place fill up quickly. (Be sure to make a reservation if you are arriving during the busy lunch hour.)

There was a vibrant atmosphere in the restaurant, but it is quite dark. The tables are somewhat closely packed together so be careful when you are walking around!

My partner ordered the Khao Sao and I ordered the Pad Thai.


 * Pork Pad Thai with medium spice *

 I have to admit, it didn't live up to expectations. I might not have had really good pad thai, but I could tell this wasn't it.

Presentation: 
- Served on a bamboo leaf with a side of chopped cabbage and peanuts. 
- Wasn't really blown away, nor did it look REALLY appetizing.

Taste:
- It was alright, and barely that. 
- The rice noodles were a tad tougher than I would have liked it, and it was really hard to pick at it. 
- The spice weren't really mixed that well. Hit a couple of pockets where it was really spicy.
- Maybe its just me, but I don't like the cabbage to go along with the Pad Thai. The crispiness of   the cabbage might go well with the soft pad thai for some, but they didn't match that well this time. Maybe the rice noodles were just too hard.

Price:
- In line with what other Thai restaurant charges in the downtown area. 
- Worth it? Maybe....not really. 

Overall, I would like to give this another try, but purely based on the name and hype of the place alone. Otherwise, you might be better off grabbing your Thai fix somewhere else. 

Cheers."}
{"text":"What can you say about any of Chef Nuit's restaurants? They're all amazing.

The only downside was that my friend ordered the green curry and was expecting it in a coconut as ordered but they were out of coconuts but didnt let us know which they really should have. Also they were out of the pork belly the first time I went so I had to get something else. 

Overall she makes the best Thai at all her (former and present) establishments!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant twice, and ordered different items each time. The food is decent, but a bit too oily and fried for my liking. You could really taste the oil in the dish, which made it a off-putting. Other than that, the place was small, but cute. Service was nothing special - if anything, waiters were a bit slow since this place always seems to be packed. Overall, if you're in the area, this place could be worth stopping by for a quick bite, but its not my favourite spot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants. So good! Love their noodle dish."}
{"text":"The khao soi here and at Sukho Thai tastes the closest to what I had while I was in Thailand (Phuket) and brings back memories every time! Sometimes I switch it up and order Chef Nuit's pad thai if I want something lighter.

I personally find Pai and Sukhothai to be on par in terms of taste and portion for their khao soi. I just end up going to Sukho Thai more often since it's closer to my office.. but I end up at Pai if I'm closer to the Entertainment District.

Once in a while I will order their thai iced tea, but it can be overly sweet and you can't customize the sugar level since it's made in batches ahead of time. I've tried their mango and sticky rice with coconut sauce also and it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered on Maegan - app said food would be here in an hour - it took an hour and a half.  Let's get one thing straight - the food is excellent; it's really good.  The thing that bugged me is that the food was really late and I was fed the line that it was the third party app's fault.  The staff was nice but the excuse seemed rehearsed.  Bottom line is that slow food is not the customer's problem; it's yours.  Tell us it's going to be slow, and we can choose to order or not and frankly worth the wait.  Again - the food shows finesse and passion; my advice is to show the same vigor with negotiating your third party contracts.  Ultimately, it's your restaurant and your customers."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Great food and atmosphere. Definitely a place to go to for lunch during business hours.

If you're looking for a place that is reasonably priced in the financial/entertainment district with tasteful food, surrounded by casual diners, this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tom Yum Goong and Pad Thai for take out for the first time. Very authentic and generous portions, and food was prepared earlier than expected. 
The restaurant itself is chaotic and packed, so I wouldn't eat there if I wanted a nice quiet meal. Great for hanging out with friends and having drinks with your food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants!! There's often a wait, and it's worth it. We put our names on the list and go for a drink next door.
Must haves at Pai are the Moo Ping, green curry (in a coconut), pad graw pra (beef), beef cheek soup.
They also make an excellent Moscow mule."}
{"text":"Best place in Toronto for some Thai food. I would recommend getting the chicken Khao Soi. Be sure to wait a long time for a table if you are a group bigger than 2 people."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots for Thai food downtown. Great atmosphere and staff and always love their customized drinks named after some of the Raptor's players. 
The grabong or squash fritters are addictive and come in a large serving perfect to share. The gaeng masaman curry was a nice subtle flavour with tender braised beef. 
The pad Thai here is what I keep coming back for. Perfectly cooked rice noodles cooked in tamarind sauce, not ketchup!"}
{"text":"This place was opened by the same people that started Khao San Road (my favourite Thai place in the city). Great food and space, but it gets very busy quickly. Also, it almost always takes them 30 mins to bring out the food so don't go if you're super hungry.

Also, make reservations! This place almost always has a line up, especially during lunch and for weekend dinner."}
{"text":"Okok, so this is pretty obvious. 

For people who want to know if pai is better than khao San Road:
Noodle lovers: Pai
Rice lovers: Khao San Road

Have to try: Thai ice tea(for people who love sweet), Grabong, Chiang Mai beef noodle soup, and Khao soi"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. There was only two of us and we showed up around 6:15 and the place was already packed! Mind you they had a lot of group reservations. So I was pretty lucky to have snagged two spots at the bar. 

Upon being seated, the bartender acknowledged us immediately even though he had a dozen drinks to make. Service was prompt. 

Our meals took a little longer than we wanted them to, but it was delicious and hot once it got to us. We probably should have ordered an appetizer. Oh well, next time! 

I had the braised beef noodle soup. The flavours were out of this world! There was a generous amount of chili flakes but that is okay with me! Generous portions of braised beef (could have been more tender but no biggy) 

My friend ordered the pad Thai. It was better than regular Pad Thai. I'm not sure what the difference between Northern Thai food is compared to the rest of the country but I like it! 

I am excited to come back with more friends. It's suggest making a reservation because, like Khao San Road, the place fills up fast and early."}
{"text":"Pai pai pai! You can't go wrong with Pai. I have to say is one of my all time top 3 Thai restaurant. Every single dish is amazing ;) 

For appetizers if not sure what to get, go for the fried squash. Great for sharing. In terms of mains, my personal favourites are the ox trail, fish and beef curry. 

Make sure to get a reservation during peak dinner hours. It gets very busy and there is always a long line up."}
{"text":"really good Thai food, central location, i recommend it. comfortable sitting. 
if you are looking for a good thai joint, you will not go wrong with this choice."}
{"text":"Arrive early because its nearly impossible to snatch a table here..and for good reason. The food (although tricky to order if its your first time eating thai) is delicious! One dessert on the menu and its amazing. Trendy little restaurant in a trendy part of Toronto"}
{"text":"Officially worst customer service in TO.  Been here plenty of times, including all the other thai hot spots littered throughout the core.  Tried this place on a weekday, it did disappoint for the first time, and in a big way.

Was in the mood for Panang but hadn't seen it on the menu, so asked the waitress.  Her answer was it's not on the menu but they have it ready, so I agreed.

When it came, the portion size was ridiculously small - half that of curries on the dinner menu i've ordered.  Waitress hadn't been seen for quite some time - to the point my date's pad thai was getting cold, so eventually I had to get up and get her.  She then tells me it was the lunch item (which is the same price as the dinner, but much smaller portions).  I was a little confused as none of this was mentioned to me when I ordered.  I asked to speak to a manager, as the waitresses solution is to order another lunch item (at dinner).

The manager, Mike, was extremely rude.  Request was simple, provide a dinner portion at dinner - or tell me ahead of time otherwise I never would have ordered it.  His response was the plates are already prepared for lunch by the chef and he cant provide dinner sizes at that point - as one would think you simply take a spoon, scoop, and put in bowl.  He was kind enough though to say I can pay for another one, like any top shelf manager.  This is when I understood I was provided something prepared 8 hours ago in a lunch plate which was later warmed up for my order.

His approach was confrontational, and quite pompous - completely incapable of seeing the issue - insisting Pai did me the favour by giving me something not on the menu - made 8 hours ago.  I handled it politely knowing I was done with Pai; unfortunately his attitude was something else - actually insisting not to ruin my evening by being unhappy with their dinner.

It's funny, I get the feeling his attitude and lack of customer service came from Pai being an example of being too popular for their own good.  Eventually Pai won't be the spot to go to for thai food, eventually there will be others that aren't owned by the same people who can't stop opening thai restaurants; and it will all start to fail with people like Mike, who lack the ability to see the customer's perspective and lacks overall people skills.

See ya Pai - you were good while you lasted - until you showed your true colors.  You will eventually realize you are buzz lightyear, and you aren't the s***, and you can't fly.  Until that time, to anywhere but Pai, and beyond!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food Ever. Make a reservation. If you don't, put your name in and take a walk - it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great value and terrific food. It's pretty crowded and loud but hey , that's the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to Pai twice in the last week and will likely go back again this coming week. In TO on business. Without a doubt, this is the best Thai food I've ever had and honestly, it's just some of the best food I've ever had period. The staff are friendly and casual, the service is quick and sassy. I will crave the Pad Gra Pow for the rest of my natural life. The morning glory is incredible and the laap salad is ridiculous. Try the sweet \"tea\" as well!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch, for takeout, for dinner with two , for dinner in a large group.  The food has never disappointed.  Chef Nuit and her kitchen staff make flavourful northern Thai cuisine that's bursting with flavour from their use of fresh and quality ingredients... especially those herbs.  Spice levels can be adjusted while ordering, and (for me), can range from no-spice detected, to a level I've never tried called Thai spicy.  Even if it's too spicy, I'm sure the fresh fruit smoothies will douse that burn deliciously.

The place fills up quickly whether it's weekday lunch or weekend dinner hours, so their online reservation system will come in handy if you have the foresight to plan ahead.  Groups of 9+ need to contact the restaurant directly... probably because they need some extra planning for large groups.

There's a private dining room that I keep hoping a friend will invite me to after they do all the organizing :P  I hear Chef Nuit can cook special or off-menu items for private dinners.  There's also a teensy patio that's open during the summer, but it's a quieter street so I imagine not as much people-watching pleasure, and it's otherwise just traffic and buildings in the vicinity.

The place is warmly and cutely decorated.  Full of Thai, reggae/bob marley, and Raptors touches... You can definitely get a glimpse of the personalities of the owners, as well as the staff.

The one missing star is for a slightly hit-or-miss drinks menu.  Bottles of beer are a touch expensive, but I guess for those wanting to relive their Thai trip, it's nice that they offer something nostalgic.  Would   The short cocktail list has fun Raptors-inspired names, and are generally decent, but fall a little short in creativity and flavour when compared to the food.  On occasion, staff demeanours have been a little less neutral or friendly then I would expect, but I know people have bad, stressful, or off days.

They seem to be fairly involved in spreading the love for Thai culture, and their \"market\" nights and Songkran events are always interesting and fun.

Overall, I love going to Pai, and am always recommending it to everyone.  There are a few things that make it just short of perfection, but I'm probably just too critical."}
{"text":"Another Thai restaurant open up in Entertainment District, owners from Sukho Thai and Gusto 101. It is hidden in the basement, the décor is like abandon factory with old relics, wooden chairs and tables. We've made reservations and luckily we were able to get our table pretty quickly. The place was packed with the dinner crowd, it's pretty noisy in there and lots of people traffic walking around.

We first had the papaya salad with salted crab. When we ordered it, we thought we would get pieces of crab. When the plate came, we were searching really hard for the crab and couldn't see any. As we dig into the papaya salad, we found little pieces of crab shell and that was is. It was suppose to be only there for flavouring and no crab meat. Boo. The salad was made from green papaya, it is hard like a cabbage, not the orange papaya. I wasn't a fan, it was served on a big plate with a few shrimp chips and vermicelli, the papaya salad was piled as a small tower in the centre but not much to eat. Not worth the $12.

After the salad, our food took  pretty long before it came. But when it came, all the dishes came at the same time. We ordered 3 mains as recommendation from the server. Chicken pad thai ($14) - this was my favourite out of the dishes. The homemade tamarind sauce was excellent, not like the other \"fake\" pad thai which tastes like ketchup. The noodles was stir fried just right, not mushy or too hard. Next dish was Gaeng Hunglay ($15) - sweet & sour curry with ox tail served with rice. It was served in a clay pot which was interesting. If it was served on a stove and bubbling as well, that would be cool. The ox tail has been cooked to tender, the meat is very soft and falls off the bone. The sweet and sour curry was good but I still prefer the golden curry. Final dish was Pad Gra Prow ($15) - famous street food in Thailand. Stir fried ground meat with basil served on rice and topped with a thai style fried egg with pork belly. The pork belly was crispy, not just the skin but the meat part as well. It was very tasty. The egg with the ground meat on rice was original, not that special so the pork belly made the difference.

We were all pretty full from all the food between the 4 of us. The service was good when the serve finally comes to our table. It's too busy and hard to get anybody's attention here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Let's get that out of the way. 

The food is delicious, drinks are reasonably priced with a good selection, the music is good and it always has a great atmosphere. 

For me the two highlight dishes are: Pad Gra Pow & Khao Soi. Both are full of flavour and perfect portion sizes. 

Service is great too. Perfect place to go with a group of friends for a fun night out. Just go....."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Thai places in the city for authenticity and taste. Waiter spoke Thai and I was able to order in Thai. Very impressed. Atmosphere is great too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"When it comes to authentic Northern Thai food this place is probably the closest. The service was average since it was really packed. But the servers were able to sufficiently satisfy our table.  The food quality was above average since very few northern thai restaurants exist in the GTA. Definitely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance at Pan are great! Visited twice prior to posting this review, and ordered pretty much everything on their small but delicious menu. Everything was great!

Highly recommend the soup to start if you like spicy fare!

Only quam is the seating is insanely uncomfortable and squishy. Tables are right against one another and the chairs are plastic stools so forget any type of support. 

Food 9/10
Service 9/10"}
{"text":"Friendly servers, great food, very filling. 

Khao Soi with Braised Beef is a must try. The pieces of beef are tender and the soup/sauce is rich and decadent thanks to the healthy dose of coconut milk. It comes with a chili oil, a few pieces of pickled veggies, and a wedge of lime. There is a twisted deep fried noodle crisp in the dish, which adds a great dimension of crunch. 

Usually there is a line for lunch, especially on weekends, so either come early, make a reservation, or come at atypical meal times. 

Only complaint: water was not refilled during service, but it is understandable as there were a full house."}
{"text":"loved it!  great service, best Khao soi i've had since leaving Chiang Mai."}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant but so worth the wait! In Toronto for 3 days and my husband are here twice and I joined for one meal.
Super chill vibe, tables are close together and some  shared spaces. 
Recommendations include: Khao Soi (braised beef), Pad Gra Prow (Holy Basil with Crispy Pork), ??Curry(coconut curry eggplant with fish) and a starter of Tom Yum. All highly recommended.
We also had two cocktails ... decent flavor but not a lot of kick... I wouldn't do a specialty cocktail again but you are there for the food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! I always go for the pad thai, the fritters, tom yum soup and chicken wings. The chicken wings THE BEST I've ever had. One time though, we ordered pad thai and it came out very bland. It was as if there wasn't any sauce on it. I complained and they gave me another one for free(which was good this time) but told me that no one else complained about their Pad Thai that night. Not sure what the waitress was getting at but i think it was unnecessary to say. You could clearly see the first Pad thai we got was dry and pale compared to the second one we got."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was fairly authentic, definitely want to try the northern specialties of their namesake city. Good location, good ambiance, would go back."}
{"text":"Pai is amazing - from their incredible food to awesome service, they always make you leave wishing you could eat more! I just dined there with a large group and every single person loved the food and had a great time."}
{"text":"By far one of the best thai restaurants in Toronto! Ive taken many ppl there and they loved it hope theyll be other locations!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good but loud.  Best dish was the green curry.  The soup went cold quickly because of the way it was served in a circular aluminum dish with no heat below the empty central portion of  it.  The papaya salad was not, for the most part, papaya.  The Isaan sausage missed the tang I expected.  The Pad Thai was pretty good but I have had better.  We did not order the Khao Soi, which is one of the two chef's signature dishes along with Chef Nuit's Pad Thai.  Service was very good in the context of a Thai street food restaurant.  Food was four star, dining experience was two star, because all of the dishes we ordered were dumped on our table at the same time and the soup went cold before we could finish it.  Thus, the three-star rating."}
{"text":"Pretty good, although I have to say I prefer Khao San Road. Wasn't a big fan of having cauliflower in my pad thai. Would definitely like to come back to try other stuff though!"}
{"text":"Un dimanche soir en take out, plus de 20 min de retard sur l'heure, prendre son temps pour venir chercher sa commande
Nous avons pris un paid thai au boeuf et un Khao soi au poulet.
Tres bon surtout le paid thai, saveurs très équilibrées mais le khao était trop épicé alors que nous avions demandé sans, un peu dommage."}
{"text":"The food is insanely good! The Khao soi is amazing, as is the pad thai, which you can't go wrong with. It's not overly sweet, just the right kind of savoury, and it keeps you coming back some more! Definitely one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant downtown, hands down! The chicken wings (THE BEST), the green curry, papaya salad, tom yum soup, pad thai and the pad grow are my favorites! I come here on a regular basis, service is good- however services could be a bit more attentative, takes a little while to wave someone down."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Food is yummy but definitely overpriced. Creative and inviting interior is a bonus. Don't visit when you are in a hurry because the tables fill up fast and food comes out slow."}
{"text":"Went to Pai on a weeknight with a friend. We decided to go based on its positive reviews. It was packed and my friend and I decided to sit at the bar. The bar stools were not comfortable, but at least we had a place to sit. So, whenever I try a new thai restaurant, I always order the pad thai to make a comparison with other pad thais. The noodles were cooked to a good consistency. It had lots of flavour. I got it medium spicy (just enough spice to taste spice without too much heat). On the whole, the pad thai was delicious. The price was reasonable. Was it the best pad thai ever? No, but pretty good. I will come back to try other dishes. The only negatives were that the service was a bit slow (but it was packed so I guess the service would be slow) and the decorations in the restaurant were a bit tacky. I mean, they tried to make the place an authentic thai restaurant, but it looked like it was a random placement of things, such as an empty bag of rice hanging on the wall near the bathrooms. Why? I dunno."}
{"text":"I finally got to try out Pai and overall the experience was good.

The Good.
- I booked an office lunch for 15 people and they were accommodating. The woman on the phone put me on hold and then came back to explain that they'll give me the reservation even though they wouldn't usually do so given the size of our party and the time. 
- The food was delicious. Everyone in my group has never heard of this place (or Sukothai, Khao San Road) so they were blown away.

The Not-So-Good.
- The food did not come all at once. One member of our party did not get her meal until almost all of us were done. That wasn't a big deal as mistakes happen. I was more concerned how they handled it. They were very apologetic and gave the our party member a free desert, which was good, but they didn't comp her meal. To me, this resolution was half complete.
- The other thing was they wouldn't give us separate bills or break down what each individual owed. One member of our party made mention to this and complained how it was a hassle. The waitress politely said how they don't do that and my party was warned before and after arrival that they don't do that. I get the point, but ultimately, this is not a good customer experience. We all had to whip out our calculators. Since 20% gratuity is already added automatically, this added to the confusion because some people were adding a tip and then being told gratuity is included and they had to re-calculate. 

Overall, the Not-So-Goods are the reason why this is a 4/5 and not a 5/5. In the end, it's about the customer experience, not what was warned or not."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times already since the summer. Never disappointed. I would come back to eat in a heartbeat if I'm in the area. 

I ordered the Chiang Mai Beef Noodles,  Gaeng Kiaw Wan  and another curry I forget now. \"Foreigner spicy\" was too spicy for me, but medium is nice. The drinks are decent and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Pai with a few friends. Note that we have high expectations for Thai food, and this place pretty much nailed it! 

We were all pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was, and how authentic it all tasted! The restaurant atmosphere was a bit on the noisy side, but with the unique decor, friendly staff and good food, it definitely made up for it! 

The northern Thai sausage is a must try! The hint of lemongrass in it was just perfect. We also got the papaya salad which was good although I would have liked it to be a bit spicier. For those who have never had a Thai papaya salad, note that they have a bit of a fishy smell due to the dried shrimp. Otherwise it's something new to try! 

My main was the green curry chicken which was delicious! It was nicely spiced, with just the right amount of the coconut flavour. We then had dessert- the mango sticky rice. It was okay, but it was bit too sweet with the overload of coconut milk. It could have also tasted better with some sesame seeds on top. 

Overall, I was impressed with the authenticity of the food. I wish we tried the morning glory (one of my fav Thai dishes), but that will be my excuse to come back! Definitely a bonus with the good service, 4/5!"}
{"text":"My go to rice dish is the pad gra prow and I make sure to order it every time. It's always busy at Pai, you have to make sure you make reservations or if you're going during the lunch rush to be there before noon. The last time I was there we waited 30 minutes for our food to come out but that's to be expected. I frequently order on ubereats to skip the line! Food is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and not too pricey!! Been there many times. If you're going on a weekend make sure you make reservations it gets pretty busy! Once we waited for an hour and a half at the bar. The curries are good and the fried rice is very good also"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Thai I've ever eaten and I'll list this as one of my best eating experiences of all time. Great ambience, service, and the food was incredible! We had pad Thai and green curry served in a coconut. Delish!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pai four times-Each time on exception of once I went without a reservation around 5 on a Friday, waited around ten minutes for a reservation, other times on a Friday the line has gone up the front steps and out the door! I've had the Chiang Mai beef soup, the pad thai, the green curry, the thai iced tea, and their mango sticky rice dessert. All portions were sizeable and the atmosphere is warm. It is a great place to dine for lunch or dinner.

Good Stuff: The beef soup, the pad thai, the green curry, the mango sticky rice. All of those dishes tasted great, and the mango sticky rice was delicious. The service is great, the staff are very attentive.

Caution: The times I have gone in the summer on a Friday night it has been lined up out the door, so be sure to reserve! Since most of the seating (two person tables/bar) are in very close proximity to each other it can get decently loud, so if you are on a first date etc. maybe go for lunch instead if you are looking for a more intimate experience. 

Overall impression: *Arnold Schwarzenegger voice* I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This, khao san road, sukhothai, all the same owners, and none have disappointed so far. Food is always solid, and there are always a few of the same dishes with a small number of new items. I wish it was a bit faster since it always seems to take ar least 40 minutes for food to arrive but overall it's always a safe bet"}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about authentic Thai food. We got to sit in their sofa area and it was quite the experience. The pad thai was spot on with the sweetness and flavor. Their curry was creamy but still had that kick to it. Overall, for the amount of money you pay, you definitely get your food's worth. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I like the food since it got the real authentic thai taste. I especially like the green curry rice. The quality-to-food ratio is decent. 

however,i do not like how they arrange seating for their customers. We waited for at least an hour and we still couldn't get a table. I think they should have a more efficient  and/or quicker way to get the customers seated."}
{"text":"A must if you are in Toronto.  The kind of restaurant you wish you had in your city.  Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"One of my fav thai restaurant in the city. I LOVE this place. If i go there next time, i will try green curry!"}
{"text":"Love love love love! I'm still on my thai food craze coming back from Phuket and this place definitely is authentic, flavorful, and worth all the hype! The decor is colorful and welcoming - although it does get a little darker in the evening (hence my pictures)  the khao soi, ox tail and pad gra grow is a must try! Simple ingredients done great"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday evening around 5pm with a friend.  We did not have reservations. The host was very gracious and advised it would be a 20 minute wait.  In less than 20 minutes they opened up a large communal table that we shared with some others.  The vibe was great and my friend and I were able to hear each other without shouting.  

We had the squash fritters and a noodle curry dish - both which were amongst the most popular items on the menu.  Both were delicious.  Next time we are anxious to try the pad thai and some of the other items on the menus.

Great atmosphere and fast service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here 3 times in the span of 3 weeks. 
With high expectations, there was no one dish that disappointed.
Coming with a large group means we got to try lots of different things. I loved all their apps, but my favourite was the mango salad, so much flavour in that one dish! Loved all their mains, regardless if its the Khao soi, Green curry, or noddle soup... all amazingly impressive with explosions of flavour. 
The only thing with thai food is that its too rich and high in salt, I always feel bloated and thirsty afterwards, but I guess its not their fault.....
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable meal - difficult to get a table at sometimes. The only real complaint I've got for Pai is the same one for the Nana and a lot of the other pop-thai places in the city...the menus are extremely similar and the seats are often uncomfortable. It's certainly a better restaurant than generic Thai spots that have some sort of pun in their name. The dishes can get really spicy if you're brazen. Fortune doesn't always favour the bold.

Now for take out, it's a pretty good option. For dine in, skip the curry in the coconut. It's a bit of gimmick."}
{"text":"Had to oxtail ; husband had the khan Sao. We shared a Thai iced Thai. Everything was heavenly. Must go. Beautiful ambience !"}
{"text":"when i thought that i knew all i could know about thai food here came Pai. excellent flavours. Great presentation (love curry in the actual coconut and once done don't forget to dig into the coconut flesh with a spoon). Happy and energetic atmosphere this is an area that most Thai places fail to deliver but not Pai."}
{"text":"Have been there for 3 times, I have to say I am not a huge fun of Thai style curry, but their pad Thai is amazing! I have tried with chicken one and beef one, I personally love the chicken one a little bit more, since they are softer. 
Mango and sticky rice is a special Thai dessert, really worth to try if you like coconut milk."}
{"text":"Pai (@PaiToronto) is a fantastic Northern Thai restaurant in Toronto that serves authentic cuisine with sophisticated flavours. Without reservations, you can wait up to an hour on weekends for a table, but it's worth it.  Some opt to sit at the bar when seating is scarce in the main dining area, but others request to sit on the floor without shoes in a traditional setting and larger parties can book private dining.  But, my favourite spot is a nook that offshoots from the main area where vintage vinyl album covers from the likes of Al Greene, Clapton, Queen, and Bob Marley decorate exposed brick walls.

My drink of choice has always been a Thai iced tea at Pai.  It consists of a robust tasting tea mixed with plenty of ice and condensed milk, a great combination to tackle the Phet Mak Mak (thai spicy) spiciness level that you can foolishly choose for your appetizers and mains.  

I typically order a main as an appetizer since they are priced similarly, but my last visit, I ordered the plah nua  (beef salad).  It featured tender grilled beef cooked to medium with shredded cabbage and a tangy lime fish sauce.  Delicious! 

You won't find an inferior ketchup-based pad thai here (think Springrolls).  Instead, you get these bouncy rice noodles mixed with a flavourful tamarind-based sauce.  In addition to your choice of chicken, beef, pork or tofu and veggies, all the usual suspects are present:  crunchy bean sprouts, egg, tofu, aromatic chives, fragrant coriander, roasted peanuts, shredded cabbage and slices of fresh lime.  All of the ingredients mingle together to create depth and layers of complexity.  I love how the dish excels by balancing savoury and acidic elements while not having to rely heavily on sweetness to satisfy \"foreigners.\"

The pad gra prow is deceptively simple.  It's just stir fried ground meat (chicken, beef or pork) on top of rice right?  Wrong.  First, it is essential to add the crispy pork belly, which is a delightful accompaniment to the ground meat .  It's so sinfully crispy that it must be fried twice.  But don't worry, the cucumber is there to cut some of the fat.  The fried egg usually has a runny yolk, which is used to combine all the ingredients into a cohesive whole along with the oyster sauce.  The chilies on the plate and in the tangy nam plik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, lime) give the dish a nice kick! 

The khao soi here (with a choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks) is one of my favourites in the city!  The deep fried crispy noodles always tower into the sky and the tender egg noodles absorb all the exquisite flavour of the golden curry below.  The curry is rich and creamy but not heavy enough to prevent me from consuming it with rice after I am done all the noodles... Why waste good curry?  My only complaint is that I don't always receive mustard vegetables with my khao soi, which is essential in creating the ultimate experience.  

Rice is an excellent canvas to capture all the bold and full-bodied flavours of all of Pai's curries but also their soups!  The gaeng masaman tamarind curry is a terrific comfort food dish for its tender braised beef, starchy potatoes, and crispy shallots.  The gaeng kiaw wan green curry served in a coconut is ordered more for its novelty than taste but you get superb taste from the kaffir lime and basil leaves.  The gaeng hunglay is a sweet and sour ginger curry served with either pork belly or oxtail.  The fall-off-the-bone oxtail was unbelievably tender!

In all, with aromatic Thai herbs and spices at their arsenal, Pai successfully finds the harmonious balance between sweetness, saltiness, and acidity in their dishes.  It's a must-go restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai dishes.  Poor, slow service resulted in getting our dishes served COLD.  We sent the dishes back only to have one dish come back hot and the other still cold!  After sending the cold dish back again did we get a freshly made dish.  There was no effort made in trying to compensate for this major oversight.

I'd like to come back, but not after this sad first impression."}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai food. Not fast food. Gets packed and busy. Delivery and take out is good too"}
{"text":"The famous Pai! While wait times have been a smidgen lengthy every time I've eaten dinner here, the food and service has always been consistently great. As far as Thai food in the city goes, I definitely recommend Pai."}
{"text":"So far, my husband and I have visited few times. 

Although we waited for a hour and half to get a table, we really love their Pad thai, Squash fries, Spring roll, Tom yum soup. 
And it is consistently amazing. 
Most of our visit, service is quite friendly and we really love the atmosphere of Thailand at Pai. 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant in a superb location! 

My friend and I were walking along the lakeshore and when our tummy's started to rumble I knew just the place I wanted to try! Even on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm this place was BUSY but not too busy that there was a lineup. The interior may not be to some people's taste as it is very kitschy but I loved the decor and the staff are super friendly. 

I had a beef pad thai and my friend had a green curry. We asked for mild spice and it had just the right amount of kick. I also went for a lemongrass iced tea which was far too sweet for my liking. I would suggest staying away from the drinks if you are not a fan of sugar. Overall the food here was great! The flavours were strong and everything tasted pretty fresh. I would just suggest going during an off time to avoid the line ups and get faster service."}
{"text":"This was THE BEST Thai food I've ever had. My group and I were visiting from Texas and found this place on yelp. It has over 1,000 reviews and for good reason! The service is great and the food is better!"}
{"text":"love the food, service is always good, wait times tend to get crazy however that just indicates how good everything is! I always recommend this place when someone wants to go out."}
{"text":"PAI is Chef Nuit's latest venture and we were excited to sample the menu for their soft opening.  The menu has our all time favourites, Squash Fritters, Red Flame Morning Glory, Pad Thai and, of course, Khoa Soi.  The new items include, Moo Ping [Northern Thai sweet grilled pork on skewer], Gaeng Hunglay [pork belly curry with ginger and roasted peanut].  

Everything was delicious, like a home cooked meal in Northern Thailand.  Chef Nuit has high standards for her food and this new restaurant is no exception."}
{"text":"One of the rare Thai restaurants to offer Beef Massaman on their menu and it is highly recommended. Their chicken satay melts in your mouth. It gets quite busy but when you are finally sitting down at a table, the service is quick and very friendly. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Oh wow. I wish I could have rated this place a 6 star restaurant, but unfortunately, I can't. The food was extremely good. We got the papaya salad and the tom yom soup for starters, then for lunch the beef curry and the pad Thai. We finished it off with mango sticky rice and coconut ice cream with some strange but awesome toppings. We're only here in Toronto for a few days, but this is definitely a MUST eat for Toronto. The service was quick and the servers were nice and spoke English fluently. Some places I've been, the servers have really strong accents, and I've had absolutely no idea what they were saying. That was definitely a plus. Also the food was very filling and well worth the money. Whether you're traveling to or live in Toronto, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing Thai food. Been here a few times now and the kitchen is unbelievable. Everything is so fresh and flavorful but at the same time simple and authentic. Try the oxtail its very tender and delicious. Service is fast and friendly. Can't wait to go back. Go with a few people so you can share all the different apps."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night and did not have to wait long to get a seat. All the regular tables were taken and the restaurant was very lively around 8:00, so the host offered us the hightop tables which we happily agreed. The hightop table seats 6 so we took one side and another party of 3 came in about half an hour later. We had ample room but still got the communal dining experience.
The owner/manager came up to us to take our orders, was very curteious and laidback, I did not feel rushed but I did notice that he really wanted us to order some drinks/alchol.
We both ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and the squash fritters (gorbang) to share as an app. Our food arrived quite quickly and was steaming hot which was awesome.

Squash Fritters: Fritters were piled high and and the dipping sauce was amazing. It's not as sweet as sweet potatoe fries but still has the \"fries\" texture. The only downside is that I though the batter was a little too thick given how thinly sliced the squash were. It was also a bit on the oily side for my taste. This does not eat like a vegetable dish in my opinion.

Pad Thai: Very hot, very nicely presented and the use of shredded cabbage instead of raw beansprouts was great. It gives the noodles a more refreshing, even cruchier texture without getting that raw vegetable taste if it was just raw beansprouts. I thought the pad thai was a bit on the saltier side, and there is much more prominent use of spices than other pad thai's I've had (such as Khao San Road).  This is really up to personal taste. I really enjoyed it, but it is not my abolsute favourite pad thai that I will have dreams about :p I see a lot of people ordering the coconut curry so that's what I'm trying next.

Thai Iced Tea: We decided to order one to share because we were already quite full after the main course and the appetizer. The ice tea comes in a big tall glass with crushed ice. Very sweet, and very rich and flavourful. THIS is the best thai ice tea I've had hands down. Other places seem to dilute theirs but not here. Even though the first server forgot to bring it out to us, when we told the owner/manager about it he immediately brought us one and it was delish. BIG thumbs up. Again, very promiment use of the spices in thai iced tea so it is up to personal taste whether you like it that strong. If you ask me, I am a big fan :)

Our bill came to $25 per person including tip. This is not an easy area to park, we did not see any street parking nearby so the best bet is to park at the public parking garage at Pearl & University. This is great if you are catching a movie at the Scotiabanks afterwards. 
Overall, I would definitely come back if I'm looking for some great thai iced tea, good curry, and a cool place to have a casual bite"}
{"text":"Chicken pad Thai and squash fries are a must. Haven't had a lot of Thai cuisine but this place is pretty good and affordable. However the ground chicken with fried egg prepared Thai style and rice was a big disappointment..not worth the price. The fried egg was nothing special. Plus the portion was small. Service was OK."}
{"text":"After reading a review in a newspaper recently, I was drawn to try their Chef Nuit Pad Thai.  I am sorry to say that I was disappointed.  I ordered take-out on a Friday lunch hour.  The overwhelming portion I read about did not appear.  There were next to no bean sprouts, or cilantro, and minimal cabbage.  It was also very, very sweet, too sweet with no other complimenting flavours.  There was none of the \"sourness, the spiciness, the savouriness\" that the article alluded too."}
{"text":"Love this place! The vibe is very cool and the food is so authentic.  Always busy so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Pai is literally my favorite Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto. The ambiance is great, Thai style with some nice Toronto touch (raptors, we the north). 

You can never go wrong with the food here. My favorite is Pad Gra Prow. It is stir fried minced meat on rice. So tasty. I would go with foreigner spicy. Unless you are really really good with spicy,  don't try Thai spicy. I learned my lesson the hard way :P Their chicken wings are very good too. The portion is small though. One order comes with three wings. 

The line can be long during lunch and dinner. They take reservation in advance but not on the same day. 

They also have a party room behind the bar that is perfect for a small party."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch (around 3pm) on a Saturday and it was packed! the wait was quick, only a couple of mins. I got the beef noodle soup and the person I was with got the noodles with yellow curry.
The waitress told us both our dishes were medium hot and we said okay.
The food was delicious! The yellow curry sauce was so creamy and tasty. my noodle soup filled my craving. The broth was so refreshing with the spices and lemongrass. My only disappointment was that medium hot isn't very hot for my taste. I will be asking for hot next time.
Overall a great dining experience. I've been here before and will be coming back. They also now do delivery!! which I'm pretty sure is new ish so I will be ordering from them more in future."}
{"text":"Attended a private event at Phai Northern. Despite being close to capacity, the bar remained open and friendly and servers continued to make their rounds. The space is quite open which was great for mingling or finding room to the side to loiter."}
{"text":"So so so good! So happy I happened on this place on yelp. Really authentic Thai food and great atmosphere. Would eat there every night of my business trip if I could. I had the Thai basil chicken can't remember the exact name but holy cow, two thumbs up! Highly recommended! And reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I had a deeply emotional experience today. I never thought I could bond with my dinner but that's exactly what happened when I decided to order a dish who's name I can't pronounce. I wanted to talk to it. With every bite i felt the Force. The sauce was the magic. Everything was cooked to culinary perfection. This is poetic food."}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai experience and fun! (beer was good as well) Food can be hot! check with the staff.... they will point you in the right direction!"}
{"text":"My visit was on a Monday night and it was impossible to make reservations as we couldn't get through to the booking line.  My advice? Make reservations way ahead of time, or expect to wait a bit during the peak lunch and dinner hours.  We got the just around 6PM and were lucky to have waited only 10-15 minutes before being seated. The host and servers are all friendly and make you feel welcomed immediately.

The space is pretty large with the main dining room area, waiting area by the bar and a private dining room for groups.  All the furniture creates a rustic & market place feel with wood furniture, school chairs and colourful decor.

Thai Iced Tea - served on a mount of crushed ice, this was delicious.

Pad Thai with Shrimp ($15.00) - Stir fried rice noodle in a homemade tamarind sauce with bean sprouts, tofu, egg & chives. This is the best Pad Thai I've had in Toronto! Highly recommended.

Khao Pad Thamada Beef ($15.00) - stirfried jasmine rice with egg, green onion & oyster sauce.
I've never had this dish before and when it came out, I thought that it looked very plain and simple. The beef was seasoned deliciously and went really well with the egg and jasmine rice. 

Khao Soi ($14.00) - fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions and chicken. This bowl of Khao Soi was very aromatic and had a lot of depth to the curry compared to the Khao Soi at other Thai restaurants. We ordered an extra bowl of rice to literally lick this bowl clean!

My friends and I shared three main entree dishes and left full and extremely satisfied. I really can't pick which dish was my favourite because reliving that night, they were all perfect to their own. Each dish had ingredients that created a harmony amongst their flavours and textures. I'm definitely not waiting to go back to Pai for Thai food! 

PS. Did I mention that they have a quaint patio in the front?"}
{"text":"Fine restaurant.  Deco is simple but original. The crew is friendly and helpful.  Food is tasty and the prices are more than correct.  Their room called Pai market where you can have a coffee waiting for your pickup order is cute as a button."}
{"text":"Great food and generous portions. Three of us shared two appetizers then had a main each, and there was more than enough. Fun vibe."}

Pai Northen Thai Kitchen opened couple months ago, led by Chef Nuit- owner of Sukho Thai and Sabai Sabai. I immediately wanted to check out the restaurant when I heard that it is served family style AND they had papaya salad on the menu.

I've been to Thailand couple years ago and the dish I fell in love with was 'som tum', which is green papaya salad that is super light but so flavorful.
I dropped by for early dinner around 6pm with a friend and found the restaurant pretty empty. I immediately loved how they decorated the place, it was spacious and very laid back with bar seats around the restaurant.

Ordered: Papaya Salad with dried shrimp or salted crab 3/5

* Shredded green papaya, tomato, long green beans, garlic, red chili, tamarind juice, fish sauce, coconut sugar and freshly squeezed lime for $10
* It was light, refreshing and very citrusy
* Nice appetizer to start the meal but small in portion
* Served with cooked noodles and deep fried pig skin
* Green papaya is very crunchy and you can mix the noodles in to soak with the sauce
* Different vegetables within the salad added variety of texture which I really enjoyed

Ordered: Beef Salad 5/5

* Grilled beef cooked to medium with fresh lemongrass, mint leaves, long leaf corriander, kaffir lime leaves and shallots in a tangy lime sauce for $12
* This was one dish that I really enjoyed
* Grilled beef on top was very tender and it went really well with crunchy vegetables on the bottom
* Corriander and lime leaves added a lot of flavor
* Lime sauce didn't overwhelm any of the ingredients

Ordered: Gaeng Masaman with braised beef 4/5

* Braised beef in a peanut, tamarind curry with potatoes and topped with deep fried crispy shallots. (contains shrimp paste)
Served with steamed jasmine rice for $15
* You can choose the spicy level for all the dishes you order
* These dishes are served family style, good for sharing with friends and family
* Served with jasmine rice, it is a perfect dish for cold days like this

Summary: I really enjoyed my dinner at Pai Northen Kitchen. It was casual, home-style and bursting with flavor. They take reservation so make sure to give them a call because by the time I left, the restaurant was super busy. I really want to go back with more people and try some other dishes they offer."}
{"text":"Delightful food! Highly recommend the moo ping and the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. The sauce was sweet, spicy and thick. I enjoyed the man's chicken pad Thai as well but I wanted to concentrate on mine."}
{"text":"Really solid Thai food - the flavours are amazing and the portion sizes are just right.  Be sure to make a reservation because the wait can be pretty long to get a table!  Ambiance-wise...the restaurant is a bit on the dark side and can get pretty loud."}
{"text":"A nice casual yet sophisticated spot to go for Thai food in Toronto! The lines can be quite long but when I went it was actually very well taken care of and we waited very little time. We sat at the low tables, cross-legged on some pillow-very aesthetic but not the best to eat in, I must say. 
The place is in a basement with minimal lighting but that's part of the atmosphere. It is very loud, however, and because of the high traffic the waiters sometimes forget about you. My friends and I shared the spring rolls which were perfectly crunchy on the oustide yet soft on the inside- portion a little small for the $8.5 they charge you. 
Green curry was delicious! Would recommend."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 3 starts due to wait time. As my family and I arrived to the restaurant, we were quickly seated - to which I was surprised as it was a Friday night. After ordering our food, we waited 40 minutes for our food to come out, while we saw people who were seated after us and received their food before us. 

The food was good. But I'm not sure if I was biased because I was hungry or if it was actually good..."}
{"text":"This place is great! Really good chicken fried rice and tasty Khao soi!"}
{"text":"The appetizers at this place are delicious. I had the spring rolls and to tom yum soup. The spring rolls were tasty and the soup was absolutely delicious. I would definitely go back if just for that soup!"}
{"text":"This place made me feel like I was back on the streets of Chiang Mai again. The Ambiance is just spot-on! It's such a fun, lively atmosphere and the space is huge! You think you're seeing all of it but it goes back quite a ways.   

The food is also very authentic. We had the fried squash blossoms, which was an enormous amount of very crispy delicious fritters, and a picture of lychee sangria to start. The sangria was very good and I particularly enjoyed the exotic fruit flavors. For our entrees, we had the green curry served in a coconut and  and the Pad Gra Pow. We got the Pad Grab Pow Thai spicy and it definitely seriously spicy. My husband loved it but I struggled. It was delicious though. 

I thought the prices were a little bit high for food was delicious, but simple. But we are in the middle of a city so a little inflation is to be expected."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Best Thai food I've ever had. Flavours were so good I ate most of the meal with my eyes closed so I could experience it to the max!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, great-tasting food, although the selection is quite limited."}
{"text":"This was a great find while in Toronto. Delicious Thai food. Great drinks. Service was excellent. We will go back on our next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Authentic, playful atmosphere and flavours are pretty good. We always feel a little heavy and sleepy after eating there for some reason!"}
{"text":"Wait time was over 40 Min. Finally sat and ordered for our group of 10+.  Pad Ka Prao chicken, Tom Yum Goong, Beef Noodle soup, Pak Boong Fai Dang, Gaeong Keaw Wan, chicken satay...  soup was too spicy creamy and salty; portions were too small; satay was too sweet; pad ka prao chicken was so so....dishes took forever to get served.  Probably somewhat decent was the Pak Boong Fai Dang-  our 2nd dish was somewhat larger in portion and crispier....wouldn't come back again....over rated!!"}
{"text":"Love this place - eaten lunch here half a dozen times with a friend or two. Food tastes great - favourite is crispy pork!"}
{"text":"As if this place needs another 5 star review...

The food here is ridiculously good. There is usually a line, so get in early if you can. It's super busy and pretty loud, so if that's not your scene, steer clear of this place. Everything I've tried here is flavourful, delicious, fresh, and a decent portion size. I highly recommend this place for great, authentic Thai food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Hits all the right notes. The flavours were complete, the dishes cooked just right - taken off the stove at exactly the right moment. I've not frequented the other restaurants in this vein, but do have a taste for Thai food and this I enjoyed.

The decor is quiet nice, and feels like there is room to breathe in this area. The \"bar\" space (Bebop?) feels a little wasted though. 

Standout dish was the deep fried squash... but of course the mango sticky rice was excellent also."}
{"text":"Great, Thai food at a reasonable price. Ambiance is fun and exciting but not too loud. Probably not the best for large groups because it can be crowded."}
{"text":"Fantastic cellar gem in the heart of Toronto near King St. and John Street.  Lineups in summer, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"It is a bit more expensive than your standard Thai variety but the quality is significantly better as well. I've tried the pork belly dishes as well as the beef massaman (not sure if spelled correctly) and both were fantastic. The thai sausage was also great and in general the meal varieties are not like anything you've experienced at other Thai cuisines, which is quite refreshing. The only reason this place doesn't deserve 4.5 or 5 stars is because of the drinks. The cocktails are far too overpriced for how good they are... which is not very."}
{"text":"probably THE best thai place in Toronto (this spot used to be held by salad king, but after the fire and remodel, it is not the same), loved all the dishes here! Must try the mango sticky rice!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic northern Thai food. If you go before 6 you should be able to get a table for dinner in a timely fashion - after that, be prepared to wait outside when the line forms. Great service, moderate prices and unreal flavor. One of the best khao soy's I've ever had!!! Fast service but all main dishes are made fresh so don't expect to eat and leave in 20 minutes. The Tom yum Cesar was so delicious except the cold shrimp was a bit meh. 10/10 would go again"}
{"text":"My first time here from the US. This place is the best Thai I have ever had. SIT AT THE BAR! Irvin and the lady behind the bar were amazing. 

From food to drinks, to atmosphere, this place is one of the best vibes I've received in a restaurant. I 10/10 recommend and give this 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service: 7.5/10
Overall experience: 7.5/10

My trip to Pai was with a girlfriend for dinner. The place was very busy, which explains some of the slowness of the service. But quite honestly, that's not why I'm giving this place 3/5 stars. 

I ordered the pad thai, and it was good! Thinking back however, I can't differentiate it between the pad thai I've eaten at Nana, or Sukho Thai, or even dare I say...Salad King! While I had been going through a Thai phase at the time, I truly believe that if a Thai place is amazing, it will come through in the pinnacle of Thai cuisines (to us Westerners anyway). So if the pad thai doesn't impress me, I may not be back.

A tip: if you are looking for pad thai that is worth your while, go to Khao San Road. It's the only pad thai that has stood out to me in Toronto. I remember thinking that this would be the kind of thing you would find on the streets of Thailand!

The atmosphere was okay, though other reviewers seem to like. It has a basement-y feel to it - very dim, and very loud with all the people. It is absolutely trendy and all that, but I like to be able to see my menu and my dinner partner.

THE BOTTOM LINE: regular Thai food in a very loud, trendy-basement space."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I would recommend people to come here! So tasty! Apart from the good food, the service and deco is nice!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place in years. I guess I had too high of expectations given their price and popularity. 

Grabong - This was probably the best thing on the menu. Very hot, crispy, and perfect for sharing! However I would say it's a little heavy for an appetizer - best for groups of 4+.

For mains we ordered Khao Soi, Pad Gra Prow, Gang Kiaw Wan, and Tom Yum Kung. The food was okay, but nothing really special in my opinion. Everything except for the Tom Yum Kung was a little too sweet for my liking. 

I honestly was expecting a lot more."}
{"text":"Had the veggie Pad Thai.  I enjoyed the food and atmosphere a lot more than Khao San Road"}
{"text":"Excellent food; noisy, casual ambiance - sometimes abysmally slow service so expect a longer than normal dinner and having to potentially flag your waiter down. Do it with a smile for your own nerves. 

Usually it's a 40 min + wait and I wouldn't suggest large groups attempt to go here without a reservation.

The food is reliably good Thai from the current masters of Thai food in Toronto.  Ambiance is nicer than Sukhothai on Wellington and equidistant from the financial district."}
{"text":"I've been getting take out from Pai since I'm not a fan of their loud and chaotic atmosphere, which has worked out quite well. Their green curry is DELICIOUS. Their Khao Soi is still delicious. Their Pad Thai is, unfortunately, underwhelming. Expensive (minimum $15) but worth it if you order the right stuff."}
{"text":"First time at Pai and I thought it was better than average. Not as good as Sukhothai but the regional flavours are different as Pai focuses on northern specialities. I had some curry egg noodle and the braised beef was DELICIOUS. Would come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"This may be the most authentic Thai food I've ever had, and Pai has perfected the experience by creating the cozy ambience that brings you back to Thailand. 

First off, I am so glad they take reservations unlike Khao San Road and the service here is much more friendly - every visit has never disappointed me. The seating area is much roomier and you don't need to yell into each other's ears to hear one another. 

My favorite dish here is the Pad Gra Proa with crispy pork. I have to stop myself from ordering this everytime because there's way too many items to try! The Khao Soi is served in a stone pot - you don't even need to taste it to know it's delicious. Just inhale the creamy goodness!

The squash fritters are a must-order appetizer. They're broken into sizable clusters so you don't need to pull at it awkwardly when sharing with a group. 

The only improvement I would suggest is their alcoholic beverages. The cocktails here have witty names but taste very watery. I'm not a drinker but my friends weren't too satisfied with their drinks. The Thai ice tea on the other hand is delicious, another must-try.

I'm in love with Chef Nuit's dishes and will forever be a regular here as long as she's working her magic in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"My fave Thai in the city! I've tried everything on the menu and nothing disappoints! Personally favourites are the Tom Yum soup - so incredibly flavourful and very spicy. The chicken panang curry - tasty, thicker red pepper based curry and of course, the pad Thai!!! Prices have gone up recently however it's still reasonable and just as delicious!"}
{"text":"For Thai food, this #1 place to go! Service, prices, food and music all Great!! Free Wifi! The space is very welcoming chill vibe! Loved it!"}
{"text":"First of all, an emphasis that the food by itself is 5-star quality. I have no idea what magical ingredients or spices they put in their soup/curry/noodles, but it's absolutely delicious. I also really enjoyed the vibe of the place - the decorations were on the hippie side, down to the tables and chairs and the washrooms. Reservations can be made easily online, a huge plus in my opinion (especially downtown...).

The stars I took off were for service alone. We went there on a Monday afternoon at 2pm, and the restaurant was half empty. So I really cannot understand why our waitress seemed to be in such a hurry to get us out of the place. 5 minutes after I received the menu, she came up to ask for orders - of course, we said that we needed more time. She gave us another 5 minutes, then came again! We asked for more time.

On the other hand, it took us multiple tries to get our water glasses refilled. Please understand that this was pretty annoying since the food could get quite spicy and water is sort of a necessity. Then, as soon as my bowl was empty, the waitress (the same waitress who disappeared throughout the rest of our meal), materialized and asked if we would like our bills. Needless to say, we were not greeted on our way out.

Damnit, Pai! I really wanted to give you a high rating after salivating over all the pictures here."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best (and more authentic) pad thais I've ever had...

There seems to be a wait for dinner almost every time I've been here (20-30 min.), but the staff is efficient and definitely makes an effort to make sure that you can get a spot once. There's a small waiting \"bench\" and bar inside, but you can also leave your number and they can give you a call or text.

I had the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with both chicken and shrimp at the \"medium\" spice with a Singha beer. They actually have 5 levels of spice (ranging from none to \"thai spicy\" - the one before that being \"foreigner spicy\"), and if you haven't had authentic thai food before, this stuff is super spicy. I don't handle heat that well, but medium gave it enough of a kick without giving me too much trouble downing it with the beer.

For dessert, we had mango sticky rice. Pretty simple, no-frills and well done.

I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Craving authentic Thai food that's not just Pad Thai? Looking for a place to try some amazing cocktails while trying amazing food? Well Pai is your place then! Decided to go here during the holiday season so as expected it was busy. I'd definitely recommend getting reservations or even trying and calling in an hour before you want to eat to just get your name on the waiting list. They have a system where they can text you when the table is ready so that's definitely helpful. The wait time for us (group of 6) was about 50 mins to an hour. While waiting, we decided to explore their drink menu. Pai has a great selection of cocktails with a bunch dedicated to the Toronto Raptors so being the Raptors fan I am, I had to try one and it was amazing. I got the JV12 which was their take on a mojito. For appetizers, we initially tried to get the Miang Kung but they were all out of it. Then we decided to get the Kung Tawt Samoon Prai, which then we were told was not available as well. We finally settled for the cocktail shrimp but I should it was mediocre with nothing special. For the main dishes, we tried the Chef Nuit Pad Thai and the Khao Pad Thamada. The flavour on both of the dishes were amazing but in terms of quantity, my partner and I could've gone for another plate. So if you're looking for large quantity over amazing quality, then you will be disappointed. We both got the Farang Spicy and I should say it just tickled my taste buds and I could've definitely gone for the Phet Mak Mak. The quality of service was average to fair with nothing exceptional with a lot of room for improvement. The hostess did not seem like she was having a great day and our server seemed a little unorganized at times."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, excellent location. My favourite dishes are the pad see ew (well-seasoned rice noodles) main and the grabong (squash fritters) appetizer. Lines can get long to get in (up to an hour) so I'd recommend making a reservation or coming on a weekday."}
{"text":"Pai's food and service is consistently good. Even when it's jam packed the food always arrives quickly and you never feel that the table is unattended. I recommend the garlic shrimp for an appetizer, everytime I go it's always been a crowd pleaser"}
{"text":"I'm writing my review based on the food, and not the service I received (i will explain further in).

I ordered the tom yum Kung, i love tom yum flavoured everything, so I was excited to try this for my first time at Pai. I loved the soup, it came out over a candle to keep it hot, served with a side of rice. It came with two jumbo shrimp and some onions and mushrooms. You can definitely taste the fish sauce, which I love in Asian cuisines. It was definitely a cozy and super tasty dish. 

However, I was very disappointed in the service we received from our waitress, and am very displeased to say that the kitchen staff who brought out our food was far more helpful than our actual waitress. We were seated and were waiting for one friend, but we knew what they wanted, so we waited for our waitress to come around to at least order our drinks, but she didnt for 15 mins and we had to flag her down, which she did not seem happy about. My boyfriend had asked her what was on tap, and she rudely replied with \"What?\" along with a displeased look. After ordering our drinks, she went off when we wanted to order our food as well, so we gave her a few minutes to punch in orders, tend other tables. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and had to flag her down again, still seemed unhappy with asking her to take our order. When my friend had noted that he had a peanut allergy and asked if there was any nuts in his dishes, she once again seemed displeased to be asked a question. It took about 20 minutes to receive our food, and some of it was cold, where as the table behind us who had sat down and order after us began receiving their food within 5 minutes of ordering. Not even once during our meal did she ask if our meal was okay or if we wanted more water, we actually had to ask a different staff member to help us out. 

Another thing I kind of found work inappropriate was what one of the servers was wearing (btw I am in no way shaming this server or have any problems with what she was wearing but in no way do I or many others find it workplace appropriate in a restaurant for families...) but she was wearing a VERY sheer top, without anything under and you could clearly see her nipples, mind you I'm ok with that, but I'm not so sure families with younger children would be okay with that. 

In the end, we received our bill from our waitress, who yet once again seemed so annoyed with us, we saw that we had a 20% service charge. I'm okay with paying a service charge, since we did have 6 people, but I don't really think that our server deserved the 20% since her coworkers were waiting our table for her. 

Overall, the food is pretty good, a little bit on the pricier side for the portion you receive but the quality is there, but I don't mind as there aren't many good Thai restaurants in Toronto. i loved the atmosphere and vibe they had going on. Honestly, the service we received was definitely subpar, but i am willing to give them another chance because everyone does have their off day, just hoping to be served by a different waitress next time.

{"text":"The service is fantastic and the Kao Soi is one of the best things I've ever eaten hands-down. Get it with braised beef. It just fell apart. The pickles and lime add just the right acidic bite. The Thai iced tea was a nice touch as well. The perfect meal."}
{"text":"Sweeeeeeet!!!! Every dish on the menu has added sugar! With every bite I thought I was eating a cup of sugar with maple syrup on top. Not for me - I'm already sweet enough!"}
{"text":"Great introduction to Northern Thai food. Will be back for more Pad gra praw and Thai iced tea! I like the ambiance too. Good customer service."}
{"text":"We got pad Thai tofu and veggies and Khao Soi with shrimp. It was very good. Flavourful and delicious"}
{"text":"Pai may be the best Thai restaurant in the city. I come frequently for lunch and the only complaint would be that the lunch menu is a little bit more limited than dinner. However, everything on the menu is great. The Khao Soi and the Green Curry are my personal two favorites for lunch. The Pad Thai is also spectacular and you can't go wrong with most of their appetizers. They also have a pretty interesting and unique cocktail list and the atmosphere in the restaurant is very lively and fun."}
{"text":"I like the food but you must either come early or make a reservation to guarantee seating."}
{"text":"Firstly, I want to say considering you have to make a reservation a month in advance, I had high expectations that were not met at all. I got the Chef Nuit Pad Thai 13; there was this disgustingly bitter taste that kept reoccurring every 1-2 bites that ruined the whole plate for me. I definitely would not recommend this place due to my bad experience. Although, other dishes might be reallly good, I do not recommend the pad thai. If you want good pad thai, I'd recommend going to Salad King."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant after my fiance checked yelp reviews. It's a hidden basement restaurant with simple decor trying to mimic Thai street restaurant vibes. We went with a table of four and ordered the green coconut curry fish in a fresh coconut served with jasmine rice (delicious, sweet and creamy, very satisfying but it gets very filling quickly), Thai wings (flavourful and savoury with fried bits of kaffir lime leaf and strong hits of lemongrass served with a delicious tamarind sauce), green papaya salad serves with pork rinds and shrimp chips (this was very authentic and close to what we had in Thailand though it couldve used a bit more dressing), it was fresh, light and tasty and probably my favourite of the night. We also ordered the chef nuit pad Thai (it was good, not great, the noodles were clumped together, not overly flavourful but it wasn't terrible either..not your average red sauce pad Thai you get at other joints BC it was authentic and made with tamarind paste which was nice) last thing we ordered was the khao soi (a red creamy coconut curry with beef and egg noodles) it was pretty good, haven't had this before so cant really compare it but I'm not usually a fan of such heavy, creamy based carby dishes...had a small portion and I didn't want to touch it anymore. Worth going to if you want a taste of Thailand close to home! Our bill came to about 100 bucks plus a beer out the door, wasn't a lot a lot of food but I didn't leave hungry."}
{"text":"When my brother told me we were going for Thai food, I certainly didn't expect the awesome atmosphere found at Pai! 

Super cool room, lots of awesome decor to take in, like the hand carved Muay Thai Barrel (see pic!) The staff was super friendly and helpful, answering our questions and helping us decide what we wanted to eat (thanks for the great service, Nicole!) 

The food.... oh my. I honestly haven't had such a unique Thai food experience before. My buddy was spot on when he called Pai \"extremely hip in comparison to other Thai places.\"

We had the chicken wings, shrimp, green curry, crispy pork rice, shrimp chips... everything was incredible. Fresh, not too spicy, great textures, brilliant sauces and insanely flavourful noms overall. Even the drinks were amazing... try the Lemongrass Iced Tea and the Thai Iced Tea if you're in the mood for something non-alcoholic!

Really amazing lunch today, thank you Pai, thank you Nicole, and thank you to my brother's friend who said \"if you go to Toronto, you have to eat at Pai.\""}
{"text":"Over-rated would be an understatement.  Let's not discuss the fact the food was 45 min late...yeah I know, this is not even fine dining.  When we got the food, you can tell it has been sitting there for at least 5 min because the curry on top was coagulated and thickened already with a layer of film.  Staff was not attentative and when we asked for water for the table of 6, I couldn't believe the attitude and the scoff.  When we also asked for separate bills, we had to negotiate to do maximum 4 for the table even though they were clearly doing more than 4 for the table over.  Oh and let's not forget the 20% auto tip for large groups...last I checked, gratuity was a sigh of great service.  I guess since they are the fad of the month, they can afford to treat people like crap.  Ps: saw a small dead mouse in the washroom stall too...juat saying"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 730pm on a Tuesday which was great as there were a lot of people waiting when we got there. It took a while for the waiters to come around to take our orders and took another while for our food to come out. We ordered the green curry and pad gra. BE WARNED, the portions are very small. So if you have a big appetite, one dish per person may not be enough. Overall I think I still prefer other Thai places around town, like Thai basil as it is more authentic and portions are much bigger. I would return again if I'm not feeling very hungry."}
{"text":"Second time here in equal number of visits to Toronto. Again, PAI goes not disappoint, even now, even now that I became vegetarian, they made a Pad Thai vegan for me and it's delish. Coupled with good rock music playing, this place is a must for Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"The food is delicious at Pai. The price point is a bit higher for Thai food however the quality is consistent. The fried chicken as an app is a must with the fried lemongrass and their chilli dipping sauce! Talking about it is making me hungry."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fabulous and the staff are very friendly. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to dine. An interesting menu filled with Northern Thai dishes (that you won't find on Sukhothai or Khao San Road's menus), I've been here twice and everything I've had has been full of flavour and quite yummy. The presentation of dishes here is really exciting as well - dishes served inside a coconut, or beautifully laid out on half a pineapple. Makes everything a little more happy! Service is good, prices good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Entering through the unassuming doors of Pai Northern Thai is a welcome reprieve from the freezing Toronto winter, where the red brick, wooden interior, and assorted souvenirs greet you like stepping off a plane and to a Thai street food stall. 

Very fair pricing for great portion sizing, no skimping on the ingredients or spices, which means no watered-down curries or soups but full-on flavoured dishes instead. Lunch offers even better deals, averaging at about $12 per entree, but even the regular dinner prices are more than fair.  If were ever a fan of the old Khao San Road, you'll be happy to see that many of the staff have moved on over to Pai with all the same friendliness, knowledge, and passion for the food. 

Standouts to me are: The spicy tom yum soup, crispy fried fish served with a little green curry on the side (smart, to keep the fish from becoming soggy with sauce), the sweet masaman braised beef, mango sticky rice dessert, and the milky sweet Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food restaurant. Had the chicken pad Thai, and the beef khao soi. The khao soi was SO good I would def come back. 

- Khao soi-Fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions 
- Chicken pad Thai was decent.
- Sangria was unique, tasted like it's got some guava juice or something like that, nonetheless it was super good
 
Parking was a nightmare as usual in central downtown, but there is parking right next to the restaurant for convenience."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazingly done. We started with the grabong, fried squash and it was crispy and delicious. Not greasy. 

The Thai tea was perfect, not too sweet and helps with the spice.

I got the Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork. Talk about amazingly flavorful! The pork was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Aromatic for sure. The sauce was tangy. I got it\"foreigner spicy\" and I could've gone spicier. If you're someone who really likes heat, I would go all the way to Thai spicy. 
The green curry came in a coconut, and was so unbelievably fresh! The fish was tender.
Everything was plated beautifully. Overall some of the best Thai food I've ever had. If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'll definitely be back.

Also, I found the service to be the perfect amount of friendly without being obnoxious. They checked in, but didn't keep bugging us. They were nice, but sincere."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place that I have EVER gone to. I would say, in comparison to Khao San Road, this is by far better. 
At Pai, the Tom Yum Soup is my favourite. Presentation is good as it comes with a burner and pot on top with a side of rice. You are able to pick the spicy level and the second level of spiciness is already super spicy. So for those that can't handle spicy, please just order no spice. The pineapple alcohol drink is also pretty refreshing as it is served in a whole pineapple. Pretty neat! 
It is bit of a wait to get a table...so I would recommend going off hours or going there a bit earlier as it would be approximately a 45min wait. 
The servers were great and atmosphere is super chill!"}
{"text":"Best memory in Toronto! Arrived at 8pm, still huge amount people waiting. We two are so luck to only wait for less than half an hour to have a seat around the bar. The food is so delicious and the drinks look beautiful. Unfortunately I was not allowed to drink for some personal reasons. But if I had the chance to Toronto again, I'm gonna definitely go to PAI to enjoy the food and drink once more!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food was delicious on both occasions that we dined here. 

The pad thai had good tangy flavour and chewiness to the noodles.

The green curry came in a hollowed out coconut husk and was the right balance of coconut sweetness and green curry spiciness.

The squash fritter (app) was a huge portion and not what I expected. Lots of crunchy battered strands of squash. I was in crispy-crunchy heaven and the garlic tamarind sauce paired with the sweetness of the squash took me to my happy place.

We actually ordered the same set of dishes on both visits - something that we don't normally do - because they were that yummy! We will be back to try other items from P's menu. We also enjoyed P's sake selection!"}
{"text":"Pai is a busy restaurant with great Thai food. I shared Khao soi, fried rice, and squash fritters. 

The squash fritters were essentially sweet potato fries on crack. Crispy with a sweet and sour tamarind sauce. Beef Khao soi was rich in flavor. Fried rice was alright. I recommend getting Khao soi and sharing it with a side of steamed rice. You don't want to waste that sauce."}
{"text":"A fantastic Papaya Salad
A quick service
A nice decor

Fun fact: I always say a highway sign outside the restaurant, not sure if it was a garage sale warehouse or a hipster cafe.
Sad fact: Winter takes away the patio charm and the summer beverages
Win fact: Papaya Salad is a winner"}
{"text":"Pai is absolutely fantastic!

I've been three times now, and each time has been great. 
The Thai green curry is outstanding and they have the best spring rolls in Toronto.
The service is always great, but be prepared for long wait times during peak lunch and dinner hours. If there is a long line, takeout is also a great option. The restaurant is on Ritual for easy ordering, and a takeout order usually takes 25 minutes or so"}
{"text":"I had a great meal, really wonderful flavours in a very comfortable and friendly setting. I'm in TO on business could eat here every trip. I had the rolls, the wings and the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup. I found the tamarind, beef, lime and chilly very well balanced, very hearty and spicy enough - I like it very spicy usually. Try the pomegranate tequila moscow mule too!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. We ordered spring rolls, pad thai, and chicken fried rice. I would order from here again, but I wouldn't eat at the restaurant again.

I made a reservation weeks in advance for two, when we arrived we were scrunched together in an area of two seater tables, I felt like my husband and I were on a date with other couples. The music was good, but loud and so it was hard while we waited. We ordered large glasses of water which were never brought, and then had to ask for a refill more than once with the small glasses which gets annoying when you're trying to enjoy a dinner and order something spicy.

All in all the food did not disappoint, I would certainly order my dish again - but the odd set up/bad service was enough to turn me off to eating in the dining room."}
{"text":"While on my way to my favourite pita place on Richmond for lunch, I saw the signs for Pai Northern Thai Kitchen and remembered that it's on my \"to try\" list. I couldn't resist!

I ordered take out and while the food takes a while to come out (15 minutes or so) it's fresh and delicious! I ordered the Panang Chicken (although I ended up getting beef instead due to a mistake with my order). It was fresh, delicious and very flavourful.

The restaurant is ideally located and is just off King Street on Duncan. I work in the area and it's actually not too easy to find a decent takeout option in the area. I will drop by for dinner soon as it looks like a fun, friendly place to have a meal. The decor is really cool and combines traditional Thai decor with a modern twist.

Considering they are only open a short time, the staff have really gotten on their feet already and are fast, efficient and friendly. Four stars despite the food mix-up, I can't wait to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had since Thailand... great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food here is very flavourful. I have eaten here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The food has never disappointed.  Their service was excellent, however when I came there for lunch, my order was misplaced and our server took several trips to the kitchen before my dishes were actually brought out. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner a little past 8:30pm on a Thursday night without reservation - we lucked out and got a table for four relatively quickly, the line-up got pretty busy shortly after we were seated.  

Tip: Make a reservation on their website as the place gets packed!

Atmosphere: The restaurant had a cozy, marketplace feel.  Super lively.  

Service: Our server was friendly, and gave us several recommendations that we went with.  She came by to advise us before she ended her shift which was professional, and appreciated!

Food: We shared the Grabong ($14, shredded squash fritters served with a sweet garlic dip) for starter - it was interesting and I wanted to love them more because I do love my fries, but they came out a bit flaccid.  For our main, we got the Khao Soi ($16.5, fresh egg noodles in golden curry with braised beef).  We went with Medium spice level, and I don't think I would go beyond that level because it had quite the kick!  The curry was extremely flavourful and I especially loved that they topped it up with crispy noodles.  I would go back to Pai for that bowl alone!  Our second main was Pad Gra Prow ($18.5), we chose to go with the crispy pork.  It was a bit on the greasy side but that's what crispy pork is about right? ;) We also ordered the Thai iced tea ($5.5) which was a nice complement for a full Thai meal experience.  

Price: Reasonable

Overall: Will I go back? Yes!"}
{"text":"Must Try: Chef Nuit's Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, Laap Salad, Khao Soi, Mango Sticky Rice 

Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Been coming here regularly for the better part of the last few years. Always consistent in the quality of food and service. Not necessarily \"authentic\" in a pure sense of Thai food, they offer a unique and delicious twist on classic and traditional Thai dishes. This twist is what makes Pai such an amazing dining experience!

I've always turned away from ordering Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant, often equating it to ordering General Tao's Chicken at a Chinese restaurant. However, Pai is the exception to this rule. Delicious fresh noodle with the perfect sauce makes this dish amazing. 

Laap Salad is one of my favourite dishes. Although a bit on the smaller size, it's an amazing Northern thai dish that is often harder to find around Toronto. The combination of pork, Thai Laap paste, sticky rice and the fixings make an amazing dish. 

Aside from the food, there is a wide variety of drinks. For the non-alcoholic drinkers, the Thai ice tea is a no brainer. For those that like a little strong libations, they offer some great beer selection, as well as unique \"Raptors\" inspired drinks, giving each starting team member their own special concoction. 

Spice is a huge part of the Thai experience, and this place knows how to do spice. Personally, I always go for Phet Mak Mak (Thai Spicy), which overs a strong flavourful kick, but nothing long lasting. There's a deep rooted flavour in the spice, rather than the painful spice one might experience with hot/suicide/armageddon/etc chicken wings. If you're fear it might be too much, I'd suggest Farang Spicy (foreigner spicy), which still packs a kick. 

You can't really go wrong with anything here, even the most basic dish still manages to have unique elements, and that's what makes Pai such a stand out hit!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great service, great drinks (cucumber collins is amazing) and great prices. We came for dinner at 6pm on a Saturday night and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, which isn't bad at all. By 7pm, the line up was out the door so come early. We ordered the Pad Da Grao and some brisket curry with potatoes (can't remember what it was called). Everything was amazing and we'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good but small quantities for the curry that comes in a coconut. The fried swash appetizer was a meal
In itself. The special tea with condensed milk was yummy but heavy. Filling on its own. Also had the pad that which was average."}
{"text":"My new favourite Thai resto!

This place is awesome. We had to wait 45 minutes to get seated as it was a Friday night and we (stupidly) didn't make resos. But they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready so you can actually leave and do things.

No wonder this place is busy. The ambiance and decor is fantastic - feels like you're actually in Pai, Thailand. The drinks were great, service was fantastic, and the food even better. We had deep fried squash to start (obviously) and I had a curry dish that was served in a coconut! (see picture).

The management like the Toronto Raptors so much that they actually have memorabilia up and the drink menu is named after players.

The Good:

1. Food. Amazing and fresh. Mad bonus points for the whole coconut.
2. Service. Our waitress was unbelievably friendly and even gave us tips on our upcoming trip to Thailand.
3. Decor. Great decor and really mashes with the vibe of the place.

The Bad (only because I gotta):

1. Queue. Make sure to make reservations - they are super busy and for good reason.

Recommendation: go here many times and try all items."}
{"text":"Pai never disappoint me. If you are looking for affordable dinning option in downtown core but show off your hip side, Pai is the place. I always love Thai food, and yes Toronto get plenty to offer, but considering the location and never failing Green Curry in a coconut, Pai becomes my go-to place if my dinning buddy is too lazy to come out with any suggestions. It is chill enough to not to dress in full suits, and not too noisy that you won't have a conversation. If you have not tried this place, check it out before or after you catch a movie in the Scotiabank theatre nearby. Btw, I also like the Basa fish they offer!"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, I knew this was going to be an authentic Thai experiencing. It's been nearly impossible to find Chang beer the way I remembered it in Thailand but this was as close as it gets. 

They had tones of options for different dietary restrictions, and all tasted delicious. Very happy all around. One critique is that the restaurant is clearly designed for larger groups of 4 or more. It would be nice if there were spots besides the small bar area for solo diners."}
{"text":"The papaya salad is really interesting where you have to mix all the ingredients yourself. It was pretty delicious -- not the typical papaya salad.

The Khao Soi curry is tasty but the noodles were a bit over cooked. Think I could've gone without it. 

The green curry has a nice presentation to it bc it came in a fresh coconut so we could eat the coconut skins which was a nice balance to the flavors."}
{"text":"I dont know what all the fuss is about. Food was food but service was crap. Had the papaya salad, pad Thai and the other most  popular dish - pad graw praw. Salad was way too small for the price. Other two dishes were well sized and tasted good, but not exceptional. Their chili oil is mediocre and the service was poor. Had to get aggressive to get service. Way overpriced and overrated"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai I've had! Of the places I've tried, the best non-tapas style Thai in Toronto.

- The Grabong is a great starter. Fried squash fritters with a very nice dip. Tasty.
- For mains I've had the Khao Soi, Gaeng Kiaw and Pad Thai. None of them disappoint.
- Coconut juice tasted fresh.

Service is normally pretty good. Welcoming staff is friendly, especially the guy who's usually there.

Unlike Khao San Road (also amazing), these guys take reservations. Big bonus!

Only negative thing is it does get pretty loud in there, we had to shout to talk to one another."}
{"text":"Terrific! Super efficient staff and gloriously delicious food. I'd eat here every day if I could. A great mix with some more traditional dishes on the menu. YUM."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance.

I've been to Pai two times and both times I was delighted with my order! The first time I went was on a girls night out with coworkers and I ordered a Caesar to drink and the oxtail (I can't quite remember the name of it). It was basically a ceramic bowl with an oxtail stew. It came with a side of jasmine rice. I was very satisfied with this order. My meal had a lot of strong flavours and the need was braised well, the meat fell off the bones. And the rice was cooked to perfection. 

The second time around I went I had the same experience in terms of customer service. I ordered the beed noodle soup this time. A must try. If you like noodles and beef, this is your dish! It was basically a bowl of pho, but a very elevated version that had different levels of flavour. It was very filling as well. Near the end of the bowl I was eating for gluttony as I couldn't stop but slurp up that soupy goodness! I generally don't drink the soup but this soup base was excellent. A lot for meat and a lot of noodles. 

The prices here are also very reasonable and its a great place to just hang out with friends after work. But go early before 630 because that's she. It gets packed. And the added bonus here is that you can make reservations. A lot of the more popular Thai places downtown don't allow you to do so. 

I will most likely return :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and great atmosphere... think twice when you order how spicy you want your food, because when they say it's spicy... they really mean it!

Green curry served on a coconut was not only visually appealing, but also a treat to my taste buds, and the Pad Thai had the real tamarind taste it should have.

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever tasted. Came here several times and it's super busy. You're lucky if you get a table. I love their shrimp pad Thai with extra shrimp and peanuts. It is the bomb. I cannot find another Thai restaurant with better shrimp pad Thai than here. 

Their cocktails are amazing too. 

The service can be a bit slow here. Me and my guests have waited almost 45 minutes for our main courses one time. Again.. you're lucky if you're not standing on the staircase waiting one hour for a table.

Also, parking is right in front of the restaurant. I've never had an issue with parking when I come here even on weekends."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Had to wait for about an hour but given it was a Friday night it was understandable. The environment is great, busy and bustling just like a Thai food joint should be. Recommend the khao soi but all the dishes are great. The green curry in a fresh coconut not only looked good but had great taste. Will come to this place again for all my Thai food cravings. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai place in the city, my favourite for sure! I've been to all the other Thai places but Pai has THE BEST Pad Gra Prow dish. It's a rice dish that you can make mild, medium, or spicy. I usually get mild and it's tolerable with just a little kick of spice. I've tried medium once and you can taste the spice at that level so if you don't take spice very well, you will not enjoy the medium spice level. I usually order the Chicken Pad Gra Prow and it never disappoints! I've probably ordered this dish 15 times now. I've tried this dish at other Thai places and they don't make it as good as they do here!

As for the other dishes, I've also tried the Pad Thai which I think is average and the Green Curry which I think is made really well here too!

The line can get super long during dinner time so best to make a reservation if you can. Otherwise, there's usually a walk-in wait for about an hour during prime dinner time. You can leave your name and number though if you do end up walking in and just hang around Queen street and do some shopping until they give you a text."}
{"text":"We had takeout from here and it was delicious! I can't wait to actually go back to the restaurant to sit down for a meal. The portions were also large, so we had leftovers for lunch the next day.

Update: We finally had the chance to actually dine in. I've tried to get reservations, but there's never availability. We decided to drop in around 6:30pm on a Friday and they said it was about a 40 minute wait. I think we got there just in time because a line started to form behind us. We started with the Grabong, get it! So good. We ordered the chef nuit pad thai and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef, which were both amazing. Again the portions are huge so we took home leftovers. I also found the prices to be really reasonable. All that food plus 2 beers came to $66!"}
{"text":"This is mine and my friends' go to place for Thai. The flavours are always great and as mentioned by our Thai friend, quite authentic. I've tried over 5 dishes there and I can say everything has been great. My favorite is pad thai but other dishes like tom yum, khao soi, pad gra prow, mango sticky rice, thai ice tea have been really good as well. I always go for 'thai spicy' level as I like spicy food I'd say it's around salad king's level 10 maybe a bit below. The place is super busy though so if you come during dinner time there's usually a wait. They expanded the back so there's more space but fyi they don't have a liquor licence there yet."}
{"text":"Amazing, flavorful food.  Get the Betel leaf appetizers.  Very busy, great atmosphere.

Service could be improved but not the food."}
{"text":"Toronto! It's about time we get an amazing, authentic Thai Restaurant in town. I love the location, decoration, the staff \"JEFF\" (the owner), and most of all the food! YUMMY! Every time I go to Malibu, California, I always go to a similar restaurant called \"Cholada\" and I always said I wish we had something like this in Toronto. Well, I don't have to wish no more! PAI is by far the best Thai food I have ever had in Toronto. YOU MUST GO! I highly recommend these dishes: Miang Kung, Grabong, Tom Yum Nam Sai Kung Mor Fai, Khao Pad Thamada, and Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Loooove their food, it is sooo flavourful and the presentation is awesome. Be prepared for the wait as everyone obviously recognises the high standard of food. The decor is hipster I suppose for lack of a better word. Decent sized portions. I have enjoyed the Pad Thai and green curry!"}
{"text":"I love Pai. It makes me happy on so many levels. I love the Pad Gra Prau. I love that I can get my food Thai or Foreigner spicy. I love the music they play. I love the sake. The only challenge is the wait as there are often long lines. But damn, this place is great."}
{"text":"Pai was phenomenal. The tom yum soup was out of this world. I had the green curry in a coconut, which was tasty and light. My girlfriend had the pad thai, which was flavorful. Prices are not bad either (around 50 for the entire meal, very full by the end, and had leftovers). Service was great! Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Toronto for about two weeks now, but Pai's Khao Soi dish is so far the most tasty dish I've had since I've been here. The curry broth is mild and unctuously rich in the best way possible with creamy coconut flavor that perfectly soaks the noodles. I took mine with the braised beef which came out delightfully tender and delicious. Service is pleasant, prompt, and attentive. There's no way I can ask for more from Pai! Wonderful food, wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Got here just before 6PM before the dinner rush. This place was packed! 

I ordered the Khao Soi with beef brisket ($15.50). Serving size wasn't very big but the dish was tasty with a creamy, curry/coconut-y soup. The beef brisket was soft and tender. Dish also came with some condiments. 

Service was good too, despite how busy it was, our glasses were consistently filled with water and waitress checked in on how we were doing after we got our food. 

Overall a good experience, thankfully with no long wait time with luck!"}
{"text":"So after raving about Pai after my first visit, I was frustrated and disappointed by their lack of customer service. I called 3 times over the course of the past few days in order to make a reservation and never received a call back to confirm or even acknowledge my messages. 
A restaurant as popular as this, which can't even confirm a lunch reservation for 2 definitely loses huge points in my opinion. I'd rather go to Khao San Road."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious and simple Thai food. So much like food from Thailand! The curries, khak soi and skewers are amazing. Also, the Thai iced tea is a MUST HAVE. The wait gets long, so definitely make a reservation a day in advance!"}
{"text":"After recently visiting the city of Pai in Northern Thailand, I was ready for the disappointment of poser thai restaurants in Toronto. I saw Pai on Urban Spoon as one of the top 10 hottest restaurants in Toronto at the moment, so thought i'd check it out with some family. The atmosphere once you walk in is just like Pai, super hippy vibes with friendly staff, warm lighting and reggae tunes. We had a round of Chang beer then started with the spring rolls and Papaya Salad. The salad was so fresh and yummy! It came with glass noodles, pork rinds and another crunchy delight on the side. For mains we ordered the chicken fried rice, the pad thai, the massamam beef curry and I had the green curry (mak mak spicy). They were all too good, just like back in Thailand. The dessert was a yummy sticky rice with egg custard. WE LOVE PAI!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Pai, why do you make me keep coming back?  This Thai staple in the downtown core is my go to for both after work dinner with friends as well as lunches with the team.

The menu is classic Thai, with the green curry being spot on.  In the evenings, it is served inside a coconut, which is so tender that you could scoop out the flesh inside and add it to your curry.  On another occasion I had the Penang beef, which was bracingly spicy, with a more hearty taste in the beef.  Hot tip: always get the Thai iced tea.

There's also a secret room at the back with a TV that can be reserved for corporate events and large gatherings as well.  A good mix of work and play I'd say."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience in Pai! We ended up sitting at the bar because the place was packed ( make sure you reserve one day in advance) which I didn't mind! The service was excellent and the vibe was great! The place is nicely decorated and the layout was warm! I ordered the green curry, it was served in a coconut and tasted great! Pai is for sure my new go to place"}
{"text":"Came here (finally) after some months of curiosity about its claims to being 'authentic' Thai food, whatever that means. So, two stars for friendly and prompt service. Might have given another star had the bartender reacted with any concern when I made it clear that I wasn't impressed. Essentially she looked at me with a bit of a shrug and what came across as, yeah I know, sorry. That was it.

Anyway, food gets zero stars for authenticity unless authentic is a Western hotel chain restaurant in Bangkok. Oh yeah, and the ingredients are substituted for cheaper, less authentic items.

1. pad gra prao - here is my main gripe; I asked for Thai spicy and it wasn't even close. I make spicier food at home for people who don't like spice. Second of all, they used Thai basil, not Holy Basil, as written clearly on the menu. It's a different plant, and a completely different flavour Profile! This entree is DEFINED BY the holy Basil in it, so what gives? 

I get it, it's harder to find and more expensive, but at $13.50 a plate either don't list it in the menu or make the effort to ensure you have the product.

2. Chicken wings were well cooked but had no interesting spice or flavour, and the tamarind sauce was inedible. Finally, the fried shallots were too thick, and either store bought or someone needs to teach the chefs how to make them properly. 

So, go if you want something safe to eat, avoid at all costs if you want any resemblance of authentic, or if you dislike when a restaurant misleads you about the product they offer."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. I chose to get the spring rolls and a curry. Both were amazing! The vibe of the restaurant is also pretty great."}
{"text":"My friends who grew up in Thailand introduced me to this place recently as an authentic Thai restaurant they really liked. Just the fact that they would recommend it was quite the statement in itself. After trying it, no disappointments at all, and it is easily now the best Thai place in Toronto for me. I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with thanks to the server's recommendation, and would highly recommend it to others as well. It's a fried rice dish that doesn't look fancy, but tastes very rich and flavourful. My friends ordered curry and other dishes, all of them had nothing but good things to say. 

As for the interior and exterior of the place, it doesn't catch your eye off the street or dazzle upon first impression. It actually felt like walking downstairs into an old basement pub, but upon entry, we were warmly greeted and felt quite comfortable. The waiters and waitresses were really friendly and ours even shared some conversation with us. I highly suggest reserving in advance on weekday nights and weekends. The place gets crazy busy and usually has a long wait. We didn't have much of a wait coming on a weekday afternoon though."}
{"text":"I had Pad Thai vegetarian and it was sooo good. My husband and I came here for lunch after reading all the Yelp reviews. The service was great! The ambience was very hippie. I liked how they served my dish on plantain leafs over a plate which gave a very authentic feel. I also had a Pai Sangria which was very fresh and colorful. They told us they could make most of their menu items vegan which actually gave us several choices."}
{"text":"Visited Pai with some buddies. It was recommended however I walked in being sceptical since I wanted to go to Khao San Road. I would later find out that Pai has the same owners as KSR! What!!! The place was spacious and quiet (we went for lunch on a Sat). 

We ordered up a Pad Thai, a Peanut Sauce Beef, a dish with chicken and rice and some Squash Fritters. We should have went spicier, I think we said medium. Which was not spicy to us. The dishes weren't very hot (temperature wise) but that didn't bother me. They were ready to eat and came in beautiful dishes. Also the water bottle they give you whistles when you pour it!

Everything was really good, I would recommend Pai to anyone. I definitely need to go back. No regrets, great experience! 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"On point...great service and good vibe... you won't be disappointed but it's also not the best Thai food of your life"}
{"text":"Line up seemed long but it actually moved quickly. They don't take day of reservations but if you call in advance, they will accommodate. 

Staff were friendly and the ambience was energetic. The food came really quickly and were all really yummy. The only downfall of the night was that they misplaced our order of chicken skewer which and the order of spring rolls weren't crispy.

Overall, I would recommend PAI as it is one of the better Thai restaurants in Toronto in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ordered from ritual and waited for over 50 mins for it to ready to pick up.

Unfriendly waitress, long wait time, generic food.
Won't order from there anymore"}
{"text":"It was my first time to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen & let me tell you... I LOVE THIS PLACE. I arrived on a Sunny Sunday afternoon with a friend. It was a busy downtown afternoon, parking was difficult to find. Ended up paying $20 for parking at a private lot. It was a wonder Sunday to walk, I didn't mind paying the $20.

Atmosphere: 
As you enter, you'll feel the restaurant's energy. The exposed brick, dim lighting, upbeat rock and roll music & energetic staff is the perfect mixture to create a drinking environment. In addition with great tasting food, I can understand why this place is rated top Thai food places in Toronto

Food & Drinks:
To start we ordered the Chicken Gai Satay. I've eaten at many places for Thai food, from Khao San Road, Thai House Cusine, Golden Thai Restaurant, Spice Thai Cafe, you get the picture. The flavor and moisture of the chicken was phenomenal. It came with a hott sauce and a vinaigrette, absolutely delicious. I highly recommend trying this appetizer.

For our mains, we ate the Khao Soi & Chef Nuit's Pad Thai. The Khao Soi was delicious to the last spoonful. A variety of flavors run through your mouth in every bite. Spices were perfect, noodles were fresh and the soup was mouth watering. Chef Nuit's Pad Thai was an instant classic, watch for your heat request, they can get real spicy real fast, I requested for the spice to be on the side. Again, fresh flavors, tender meat, absolutely delicious.

Price:
Our bill came up to almost $75 before tip. We also drank Singha Beers & has a couple of Sake Bombs! So much fun.

Overall, just writing this review and thinking about their food makes me crave them even more. Take a look at some of the photos I posted, but I suggest go have a bite in your free time to really appreciate the taste. This will be my new go to Thai Food place when the cravings hit. Great job Pai, thank you for a great atmosphere, awesome energy and most of all delicious food!"}
{"text":"This Thai spot is consistently delicious and to add to it, they TAKE RESERVATIONS!!
It is our favourite Thai place in Toronto - the Kao Soi (curry noodle soup) and Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup are 2 of my fave dishes. The Pad Gra Prow is served with the perfectly cooked egg on the side.  Another bonus is that they also deliver via Uber eats!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never had a bad meal here. Make sure to make reservations. Perhaps the only way you can walk in without one is if you go for dinner at 5pm. 

We always get the grabong (squash fritters, $12.50) to start, and always wish we'd ordered one for each person. The garlic tamarind dip is magic. It's stupidly good. I often get the gaeng masaman with braised beef ($15), as well. I ask for it mild, and I inhale the whole thing far too fast.

The Gaeng Kiaw Wan (served in a coconut, $18) is also really good. You choose the meat you want in the green curry, and you eat it from a coconut. Come on, why are you still reading this? Just go to Pai already."}
{"text":"There will trully never be words to express how phenomenal this restaurant is. The hype is real and justified. There's a little something for everyone despite spice level tolerance. The waiters and waitresses truly care about you, keep coming by asking how everything is, give their recommendations, fill your water glass as often as possible. This is my go-to and take everyone here! Be sure to either eat early or late because their busiest times are the traditional 5-8pm times! (I went at 4:30pm yesterday and it was already packed and when I left around 5pm the line was beginning to form!)

Best restaurant for Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"Literally the best Thai food in Toronto. It is not easy to get a table here, but the ambience is great, the food is amazing and the servers here are great! Prices are a little higher than you would expect for Thai food, but definately worth it."}
{"text":"UberEATS Dinner: Pad Thai, golden curry with noodles and green curry.

Value, taste, service: 4/5

Notes: Perhaps a bit overhyped. Fave southeast Asian place is still gourmet Malaysia"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday on a double date.  Since we had kids we don't get out much so when we do we try to go to places that have had good ratings.  The food is different then other Thai restaurants.  The presentation of the food was very appealing.   We tried a couple of appetizers, mains and dessert.  I would say the food was average.  Nothing that made me go \"wow\" but it was good.  The service was excellent.  Usually at restaurants you have a dedicated one server, however with pai - you do with one serve but every serve was happy to help us get stuff or answer any questions we had.   Thank goodness we made reservations,  the line up was crazy.   For the duration that we were there it never died down.  The place actually looks and feels like a bar in Thailand that catered to foreigners reminds me of my vacations in Thailand."}
{"text":"Best in town.
Must make a reservation one day in ahead if you want to go in a busy time."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Had the green curry and was one of the better curries I've ever had. Great staff, very friendly! And quite a big restaurant perfect for large groups."}
{"text":"I eat Thai food every Thursday. It's a ritual - like pizza on Fridays. Last night, visiting family in Toronto, we went for Thai food. We tried the green curry served in a coconut, the house pad Thai, and the chicken satay. THIS WAS THE BEST THAI FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN. If you're the type of person that just TOLERATES Thai food, you have to go to Pai. You will then be a fan of Thai food. I'll be going back before I leave Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this place foods! So yummy and service is good. Alway line up. Atmosphere is nice and Tai style. Quick service. I want to come back here soon."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner with my girls when they were in town and after learning my lesson last time (a substitution of rice noodles for egg noodles in the Khao Soi rendered the noodles soggy and limp), I decided to order a menu item provided with no substitutions this time.

My girl friends started off with some cocktails, but as I felt slightly sick, I opted out of the fun. One got the plum mule but didn't seem to particularly enjoy it. The other got the Thai mojito - I had a sip, and it was surprisingly good!

We then started off with an appetizer. Although every table had a starter portion of the fried butternut squash fritter, we didn't order it as my throat hurt. We opted instead for the Miang Kung. It was so good! Definitely something refreshingly different! 

The betel leaf, paired with the shrimp, minced garlic, onion, ginger, and lime, hot peppers, roasted coconut and tamarind sauce was amazing! Although the menu says there was coconut sugar, all I could taste was something highly resembling dried shrimp jerky. It was slightly fishy, but had a great kick and was my favourite! The tamarind sauce was quite sweet, but you needed it to hold all the ingredients together (otherwise, it'll be fairly messy). The peanuts and coconut added a nice crunch. My only complaint is that there was very little shrimp...

I got the Tom Yum Kung soup for a main. It was a little on the sour and sour side, but the feelings were very complex and multifaceted. There was sufficient spice, and the tomato flavour helped with the sweet aspect. There was also a generous serving of massive tiger shrimp (I got five pieces!) along with a vegetable assortment such as mushrooms, tomatoes, and onions. I also thoroughly enjoyed the coriander added to it! However, I was unable to finish it all as the soup got quite unbearably salty.

My friends ordered the braised beef Khao Soi and the Gang Kiaw Wan with chicken (green curry served in a young coconut). The one who got the Khao Soi opted out of adding the pickled vegetables, and it's amazing the difference it makes! There's one layer of complexity missing. Then again, she also added less chili oil, which may explain the difference. I do prefer the chicken drumstick over the braised beef - I found the beef to not be fully tender in certain areas, and it didn't appear to be very fresh (had a certain smell to it). 

For those who order the green curry, be forewarned! Upon first taste, I thought that the chicken added was very old and had a freezer smell... Until it hit me soon after that the aftertaste came not from the chicken, but the bamboo shoots! It's likely that the canned bamboo shoots aren't that fresh, and therefore have a stronger flavour - unlike the sweeter, more subtle taste of younger well prepped shoots. For those who understand what I'm saying and hate that taste, don't order the green curry!

Overall, a solid meal with phenomenal service. That said, as we came on a Saturday at 6 (no reservations were available), we did have to wait for 30 minutes. But we were already lucky enough to just narrowly avoid the crowd that came after!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Great place. We were at an art show across the street and so we thought we'd end the night at Pai! Reminded me of Thailand so much. Very nice and cosy, looks like a good place to spend an evening with friends or your partner. 

Food portions are out of control - so good! We had the Khao Soi and the Pad Thai. Service was good. Very loud in here and dark, so if ya don't wanna see your companion's face, then go here. haha, but really, great good. You can easily order one entree and have leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food I've had in a long time! Everything we had was delicious. Specific to northern Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Favourite thai place! Loved the coconut green curry, can't get enough of it"}
{"text":"A great Thai place, uncomplicated, simple, good food. Had the gaeng panang w tofu, delicious with some chili oil. Worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on a weekday; be warned, it gets really packed because the food is DANGEROUSLY GOOD! The best authentic Thai food that I've had in Toronto!

I would actually give Pai a 4.5/5, only due to the slow service. The restaurant itself seats lots of people and does not have too many servers, so the service is actually quite slow (but still everyone was extremely nice and friendly). We got seated right away and did not need to wait the line since we were okay with a communal table, which was actually enjoyable since they separate your party and the party next to you by leaving an empty seat. 

We ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken! It was so packed with flavour and the portion size was really good. It was a nice blend of both sweet and savoury, with the perfect amount of peanuts and coriander. 

I'm excited to come back soon to try more food from their menu!"}
{"text":"Good ol' yelp directed me here. The reviews are stellar and I was hungry, so it was an absolute no-brainer.

There's honestly nothing quite like Thai food (really good and homemade, that is) to comfort you during the cold winter. I love how the menu isn't too elaborate nor too simple because it gives you options without being overwhelmed. 

We started off with the northern Thai sausage (pork belly) and it came with sticky rice (yum!). 3 of the 4 of us went with their chef nuit pad thai (it's always a safe option to go with). Their portions are generous and reasonably priced as a result ($14-15 per main dish I believe). I went with the khao soi, which consists of fresh egg noodles in a delectable coconut milk curry. Seriously, if you're ever in a mood for real good curry, this is the dish to go for because the noodles are drenched in it. I wish there was some naan to dip though.. (lol). We thoroughly enjoyed every dish. 

Service was fantastic, with periodic check ups here and there. Always there when we needed something too. 

Guys, the reviews don't lie. This place is lit... for damn good reason."}
{"text":"We came to Toronto for the night and saw Pai on Yelp. With so many good reviews we had to come and try it out ourselves. We were not disappointed. It was Friday night so the wait was about an hour, which is not unreasonable. The host was super friendly. We went to the bar next door while we waited. They also have a little lounge room with drinks and snacks while you wait if you choose to wait inside. Once we were seated we got drinks immediately. We got a pitcher of sangria which was amazing. We ordered a ton of appetizers and entrees, all which were delicious. Our server, Ivy was very attentive and friendly. I wish there was a Pai in New York! Would defiantly recommend this place to anyone who loves Thai food or wants to try something new."}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant giving 5 star reviews but I can't really think of a better thai experience in recent memory. Massaman curry, khao soi, green curry, and prad gra prow, all as good or better than I had hoped for. Price was reasonable for the level of quality, and I liked the side chilli that came with the khao soi. I was expecting long lineups but at around 12:40pm on a weekday, we immediately got seats. One very satisfied customer here."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! We wanted to try this place and booked the first Saturday night reservation that had .. 2 months in advance. After waiting so long we were very excited to finally try what everyone has been talking about and it was definitely worth the wait! I understand why people put their name on the list and wait over an hour for a table. The service was incredible and the food was amazing. The appetizers were delicious especially the squash. The mains were the perfect size. Were ordered 4 mains for 4 people and shared everything- it was more than enough food. The flavors were delicious especially the green curry and basil sauce dish. It is very lively atmosphere we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Trendy little spot for decent pad thai but not worth the wait or the lack of personal space.  After a 20m wait, we were crammed into a tiny table where my 6'4\" partner was barely able to get his knees under the table or put food in his mouth without elbow-jabbing the person next to him.  If you like the food, just order take-out."}
{"text":"If you are thinking about going to this place on a weekend, reserve a table right now!! This place is almost always booked especially in Winter. There is usually a long line-up in front of it. Do yourself a favour and avoid the line up in the cold weather and book it in advance.

We reserved a table for two 3 weeks in advance. The place looks like you have walked into a store in Thailand! The decorations, old tables and candles all add to the coziness of the place. Service is quick (they have so many tables to take care of so they would rather you order quickly). 
I really liked their Thai tea. Cocktails were good too. Their famous dish is the Khao Soi. I got it with braised beef. Sooooo good! Their green curry was also amazing (it is served in a coconut!).The portion sizes are huge at this place, I think one main and one appetizer is enough for two people.
For the spice level we both got mild, which was the perfect amount of spice.
Tldr: This place is a must try if you have not been there yet!"}
{"text":"Went to Pai over the weekend and got the tom yum soup. Delicious and packed with savory lemongrass flavor, shrimp and veggies."}
{"text":"Incredible food, beautiful place. Make a reservation as it is always super busy. A great place to take visitors from out of town as it's a unique gem of Toronto."}
{"text":"Pai is definitely worth the hype, a must try!!

After several friends recommended this restaurant we finally decided to make the trip downtown to try it, and here's my review of Pai:

Mains and Apps: 5*: 
Golden curry dish with fresh and fried egg noodle was delicious.  The curry flavour was unique and flavourfull.  Came with around 6 to 8 shrimps which was generous in my opinion.

Green curry chicken in young coconut dish was delish.  Especially scraping off the meat inside the coconut and mixing it with the curry.  Comes with rice, and if the curry doesn't all fit into the coconut they will give you a seperate bowl for the rest.

Thai Chicken wings was also very nicely marinated, crispy, and juicy.  $5.50 for only 3 wings (not whole wing, the winglette part only) is a bit pricey though, I think it should come standard with 4 pieces, had to pay $2 ectra for 1 more wing.

Drinks 5*: Thai Iced Tea was great and came in a large sized cup with ice.

Dessert 5*: Mango Sticky Rice: myst tey dessert!  Comes with 2 big pieces of mango and the rice was yummy.

Place 5*: not fancy but a great casual atmosphere.  Makes you feel like you are in Thailand, well done with the decor.

Service 4*: only complaint is that food orders came out quite slow.  Apoetizee and drink came almost instantly but main dishes took 30+ mins.  We also ordered a Pad Thai for takeout and for some reason, that came early while the food we were eating there took much longer.  Also be prepared to wait for seating, quite a line up even at 4pm on a Saturday.

Overall, would love to come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Thursday night with a few friends.
We ordered the Grabang to share and I personally had their Pad Thai.
Grabang was delicious! Perfect balance between salty, sweet and crispy and soft - just the way I like my fries.
I really liked my pad thai, but personally would have preferred it a little sweeter. It was a huge portion though - I could only get through half of it.
Their Thai Iced Tea is also refreshing.
I will definitely be back to try their curry.
Servers were all attentive and helpful. For ambiance, the set up was very cozy. It made for easy conversation. However it was fairly dark at our table making it hard to even see the menu/the food in front of us. We could have used another candle."}
{"text":"I L O V E P A I ! ! !
This is easily my favourite thai place, and favourite restaurant in Toronto, for that matter. 
I have been here several times and it has not disappointed each time. I've tried the Khao Soi, Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup, and Gang Kiaw Wan (in a coconut). I can say that the portions are enough for me (I don't eat that much) to be full and not finish all the rice or noodles. Wait time to get a table can be super long and the service is not amazing, but the food is so good it keeps me coming back. 

I would recommend to come around 5-6ish on a weekday if you don't want to wait. 
This is a good place to come with friends, family, partner, coworkers, even alone really!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Only down side is long line-up !
Food is great in taste but a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Not much to add but finally a place where it isn't over hyped by Yelpers. 

The food and service is great.

I had to get reserve a table a couple weeks ahead.

4.5 Stars but rounding down."}
{"text":"HEART EYES ABOUT THIS THAI RESTAURANT. I legit loved every dish we ordered and I will be coming back to try everything else they have to offer. The ambience is very upbeat and lively, and the interior gives off an exotic vibe - almost makes it seem like I've stepped into Thailand for a bit. 

We ordered a few dishes to share including the chicken pad Thai, Panang beef curry, and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. Just as a side note - the spice levels on curry dishes cannot be adjusted (all the curry comes mild) Anyways, each dish was so flavourful and delicious. We got the foreigner level of spice for the chicken pad Thai but it was pretty spicy so take caution! 

For dessert we ordered the mango sticky rice which is a specialty not included on the menu. Unfortunately, our mango sticky rice only came with one slice of mango, although in previous photos I've seen on Yelp had two slices. Either way, it was amazing - but an acquired taste for those who might find it odd to be eating mango with rice. The Thai iced tea is also a great addition to the meal! Despite being a bit too sweet and quite pricey for its size, it definitely completes the experience."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Khao San Road so I was sooooo excited about this addition to Toronto and to the Chef Nuit collection of Thai restaurants (note that she's no longer at khao san road). I have been looking forward to it so much that I dragged my sorority little sister with me one day. The vibe is very smiliar to Khao San Road: small tables, long wait time, a little bit cramped (if you don't mind eating elbow to elbow with a stranger & eavesdropping on their conversation or correcting their pronunciation of menu items) but an overall hipster vibe... my kind of place! 

We ordered the Green Curry (which comes in a coconut) and got it regular spicy as well as the squash fritters and also the Chef Nuit's Pad Thai (also regular spicy). At first the regular spicy curry was not too bad but after a few more bites, you feel the kick. I would really recommend this item - it was super tasty and I think next time, I would even go one spicy level higher."}
{"text":"In Toronto for the day and hit this place based solely on the Yelp rating. Absolute score. It's northern Thai, in a street cafe style setting. The dishes were perfectly seasoned and flavorful set apart from standard Thai restaurants you find in the west. Prices are good and the atmosphere is the perfect compliment. A must when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing ambience. Ordered Pad Thai and their green curry and it was delicious. Definitely on par with Khao San Road, although Pai has better presentation and way more seating."}
{"text":"The ambience and the place are awesome. The restaurant is really spacious with different spaces. Staff was friendly and attentive. The food was good, but my dish arrived cold. This the first Thai restaurant I try in the city, I certainly hope others will be better. Personally, I don't think the quality/price ratio is there yet."}
{"text":"the BEST Thai food I have ever had! their service was great and the food was delicious! I will definitely be going back again. I had the chicken pad Thai with the peanut sauce (additional charge) and the person I went with had the coconut veggie curry that came in a real fresh coconut!"}
{"text":"Really great thai in a funky downstairs spot. Larb salad was top notch."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was on point! The vibe, the quirky decor, the music selection and most importantly the food! The Khao Soi was incredible and was definitely worth missing my flight home to Chicago. Pad Thai - bomb. Thai Iced Tea - bomb. Definitely the best Thai spot I've been to."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cocktails, vibe. Extremely popular spot, but if not in need of a table, I highly recommend sitting at one of the two bars and jumping the massive queue. Of all the items on the menu, I'm going to highlight the Thai Beef Salad. Get it as an app for a few people or have it + a smaller dish as your meal. Tender and so tasty - seasoned perfectly and not too much dressing (as happens sometimes). Service was attentive and music had great presence without being too loud. Great spot."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to having lunch at Khao San Road when I discovered a few days before my vacation that KSR was temporary closed. I was devastated but was assured by the hotel that Pai was equally as good. Unfortunately, I didn't love Pai. 

Food/Drinks: I ordered the Khao So. The dish came out cold. I requested a new one to be made or warm up the existing dish. A new dish was made. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. It was too heavy. Additionally, there was oil that was visibly separating from the sauce as I ate the dish. The flavors were not that bold. Overall, I was very disappointed. We also got the Pad Thai that was better than the Khao So but not great. I had the sangria, which also fell short. 


The service was slow and the atmosphere was cheesy/diving."}
{"text":"Delicious! 
The restaurant was packed, and there was an hour wait. 
I was initially put off by Pai's unwillingness to alter their menu items. However, when the food came, it was delicious, spicy, and perfect."}
{"text":"We waited 50 min for our food today, which was out of the ordinary. But the owner apologized and offered a discount so I'm willing to come back and try again."}
{"text":"Its really good stuff. Thai food from a very specific region. They served me my green curry in a coconut! Very unique.

Great decor and they play some really good chill beats."}
{"text":"Great vibe, reasonably priced food. A good place to go with a group of friends or co-workers"}
{"text":"Feel like I am back home in Northern Thailand eating Northern Thai Food. Taste just like home. This is not just a regular Thai restaurant. The atmosphere, the food, the staff were excellent."}
{"text":"One of my go to places when craving Thai food. One of my favorites is the chiang Mai beef noodle - the broth is difficult to describe with a sour taste similar to Tom yum and had generous portions of beef. Their pa gra prow is very flavourful and the egg is . Would recommend everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Sooooo gooood. One of the best Thai restaurant I've been to. I loved every part of my experience here. I had the shredded squash fries for the starter, green curry and golden curry with egg noodle to share and everything tasted great. To my personal taste green curry was the best. It had perfect level of spice and was full of flavour. The restaurant was busy even on a Monday night, but we had no difficulty being seated. On weekend nights however finding seats will be easier with making a reservation before hand. I would definitely go back to try more food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Better than Khao San Road in Toronto! So delicious and great quality! Chilled out atmosphere. Restaurant is a tight space and does get pretty crowded though. Still worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is good and the place is nice. Service also is good but this place is packed! I would say although the food is good but it is a bit expensive for the portion. I ordered a chicken pad thai and gaeng masaman with braised beef. Pad Thai is a bit on the sweet side and not enough peanut for me. The gaeng masaman braised beef has good curry but the beef need to be more tender. Overall it's good place to eat and make sure to come early otherwise you will need to line up for roughly 30mins for 2 people if you come at 7pm. Also the food take a bit time to come. Although food portion isn't big but it's filling enough since it's either come with rice or noodle. Also they don't take same day reservation"}
{"text":"Food alone maybe would be a 4.5.

The basil ground pork dish became my favourite thing to eat when I was in Thailand, so I had to order the Pad Gra Prow. Although not as much basil flavour as I was used to, it was still great . I had it in Thai spicy, which was perfect for me. Super flavourful and addictive. My friend had the khao soi which she loved. I tried a bit of her dish and found it to be rich, super coconuty and delicious. I loved the food there. That being said, I wasn't too hungry when I got there,.so it was just enough food for me. However, me and my friend both found the portion to be a bit smaller than expected. If I was hungry, I probably wouldn't have been satisfied. 

I also ordered a sangria but the bar gave me the wrong drink. I had already taken a sip of it so I told them it was fine when they asked if I wanted the drink i ordered. I have no idea what drink they gave me, but I hated it. I really wish I had gotten my sangria.....

Also we came here around 6 on a Friday n
ight and had to wait 40 minutes for a table. This place is super popular....I still just want my sangria!"}
{"text":"So glad I made the time to visit Pai when in Toronto. The good reviews I read here are definitely well deserved. The staff was very helpful and responsive, the atmosphere is legit, but most important the food is sooo good. I had the sangria that had lychees, so weird but so perfect. Can't remember the dishes name - had ground beef with crispy pork and fried egg - the bar tender recommended it and it was divine."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for lunch today. The food was good. However, I will never come this restaurant again because of there insistence on ripping off the customer. I ordered a $5 Thai iced tea. The cup came out with 1.5oz of liquid with the rest filled to the brim with ice. Upon asking for slightly less ice, the server was rude and unaccommodating. When it was time to pay the bill, an mandatory 20% gratuity was included in the bill. I've never come across a gratuity this high, especially for rather sub-par service. As a student, 20% is difficult to manage. It is presumptuous and a clear indication of their priorities."}
{"text":"Thanks goodness for Pai!  Seating is spacious.  Food is delicious. Service is attentive.  Decor has nice authentic touches.  Music adds a definite fun and relaxing vibe.  There is a comfortable stage seating area where you can spread out after eating your heart's desire.   Loved the coconut bowl for my green curry.  Got to scrape the young coconut off from the inside which enhanced the eating experience.  So glad this place opened up!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during a weekday, and as soon as I stepped in I felt whisked away from the suits and hard lighting of the financial district. Amazing decor and despite the fact that it's underground and natural lighting was at a minimum, it didn't feel stuffy or dingy. It was bumping around 1, but had for the most part cleared out by 2 or so. 

The PAD GRA PROW offered so many familiar comforting flavours, yet I had never had the dish before. The pork option comes with tender ground pork, and the beef option gives you a little bit more chew. I liked the beef. Topped with a runny egg and this just might be my new comfort dish.

The PAPAYA SALAD was well seasoned and I enjoyed that the dried shrimp were so large that you could get some chew out of them but my dining companion wasn't quite as fond of the shrimp. Portion size was perfect to share amongst two people, and it was also served with shirmp chips and chicharrons.

The THAI TEA was delicious, served classically over a ton of crushed ice. A little bit sweet for my usual palate but I loved the spices that came through. 

Apparently they were running a once-a-month night market, but will be scaling back to once-a-quarter in the new year. Def interested in checking that out!"}
{"text":"Fun place to visit with nice presentation and lively atmosphere. This won't be the best Thai food you've had but it will be a solid meal. Still feels a bit restrained in terms of spices but maybe I'm benchmarking too much to the motherland.  Nice location and great place for a group meal."}
{"text":"The problem was with our server. She never once checked on us, a man who may have been the owner did once. We finished our food and ordered mango sticky rice with the man who wasn't even our server. No less than 25 minutes passed before we flagged down the man again to check on our dessert. He said there was a mix up in the kitchen but that he would get them right out, which he did. An hour and 45 minutes after sitting we were able to enjoy our dessert. Lucky for us, our \"server\" was taking an order from a nearby table and we were able to get our check and get out of there.

Maybe it was an off night, but that server ruined what could have been a great meal."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. It's a very busy restaurant so make sure you make reservations. We've tried to walk in before and were turned away so we've learned to always reserve a table. My favourite menu item is the green curry - it comes in a coconut!!"}
{"text":"Pretty long wait but at least you can grab drinks and apps by the bar (but it was a bit cramped). 

I ordered the pad Thai and honestly.. it was really good (perhaps the best pad Thai I've had) but something about pad Thai in general feels lacklustre. I wish I had ordered a curry instead.

I also tried the Grabong as an appetizer. I was hoping for more squash flavour but it mostly just tasted like the fried batter coating (which was tasty...)."}
{"text":"Pai is my all time favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The only problem is that it's hard to get a reservation, even for weekdays. You have to do it weeks in advance. They do accept walk-ins, but prepare for a long wait. They text you when your table is ready, which is a nice bonus because then you can leave the restaurant and walk around or go to the bar next door and get a drink. 
Their pad thai is delicious. The best pad thai in Toronto. I also love their spring rolls, squash fritters and thai iced tea. The portion for the squash fritters is large so it's a good choice for sharing with the table.
Their thai iced tea is the perfect combination of sweetness and creaminess. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"man, mine place, but a major rip off!!! Don't go here if you're hungry. Portions are very small and over priced and service is very slow."}
{"text":"When I go for Thai in Toronto I usually anticipate food court style Thai and am often disappointed.

Pai Northern Thai is a refreshing experience and without a doubt the best Thai I've ever had.  The moo ping is excellent and the grabong is definitely a must order. The thai iced tea is delicious, though very very sweet.

The service is friendly and attentive. Overall it's a stellar spot. We'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"A huge disappointment. I went here with high expectations due to the Yelp reviews. The atmosphere was very rustic and happy with wooden furniture and a raptors stuffed animal, colourful lights, etc. I first ordered the thai milk tea, Im glad we shared it. It was expensive and it was so sweet to the point that it tasted like chocolate milk. The chicken khao soi was lukewarm and had so little egg noodles and chicken relative to the broth itself. Taste of curry was fine but unappetizing as it wasn't hot. The tom yum soup was also lukewarm despite that it was on top of a flame. It was so sour and spicy with zero complexity in flavour that we didn't finish most of it. The few shrimps were fresh and cooked well."}
{"text":"Pai lives up to the average review of 4 stars.  The Panang Beef and Pad Thai were both very good and we loved the decor.  I'd probably rate it a 4.25/5 if able, with the slight ding due to the green papaya salad.  It wasn't bad, just a little too \"soupy\" for our liking.  Overall, if you're looking for a place to grab good Thai, a drink or two, and a fun atmosphere, Pai will more than suffice."}
{"text":"Great place, truly traditional... My husband and I love spicy, but beware, Thai spicy is a whole new level! Delicious food, but I recommend a reso, it took us a few times to finally get in because of their long wait times."}
{"text":"Does Pai need another 5 star review? No. Yet here I am writing another 5 star review. I would recommend Pai to anyone visiting Toronto because I want them to experience the diversity of food our city has to offer. This is one of the hidden authentic gems. Easy on the pocket, big on flavour and experience. The green curry and pad Thai are done right. Their Thai iced tea is amazinnngg but ask for less ice. If you're not feeling curry or noodles I would recommend the fried basa fish. Its heavier than the other dishes but it's SO good!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Loud and lively atmosphere (maybe even too loud). Very quick, friendly service. Altogether an awesome place to stop and grab a bite to eat!

I ordered the green curry and loved that it came inside a coconut! Scraping off the coconut flesh that was soaked in curry sauce was so, so, so good. I think the coconut cooled down the curry though because it wasn't too hot when I got it. The flavour definitely made up for the lack of temperature heat - it was the perfect amount of spice. There was lots of meat and veggies inside of the curry and it was a decent portion. I left feeling full, but not too stuffed."}
{"text":"Had a farewell dinner for a good friend who's leaving for Singapore,  she's from Thailand and had highly recommended this place as the most authentic thai restaurant in Toronto. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, everything in the pictures were pretty good, but most notable were the Kal soy(curry noodles with braised beef) and the Tum Yum soup, both were exceptionally flavourful.  Apparently khal San Road has the same curry noodle dish but is more oily.  

Reservation is highly recommended for this restaurant, they get pretty busy here"}
{"text":"Ate at the bar as it was very busy- the food was phenomenal.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very busy even in the early evening, around 5:30 pm. My friend and I waited for 10 minutes to be seated. Waitresses were welcoming. Inside the restaurant there are more than 20 tables, and they were all occupied when we arrived. Given such circumstances, 15 minutes waiting for the dishes to be served was not a long time, and foods were great. I ordered a beef with green curry, medium spicy. The beef was tender and the taste of curry was rich. I mixed the curry with jasmine rice and finished it all. Definitely will come back again and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"At the time of this review, I had heard that the original owner of Khao Son Road had sold his franchise and started from the ground up with Pai!  As a big fan of the original, I decided to check this place out.

We started with the usual sweet potato Fritters and was surprised to see a very generous serving.  My next bench mark for any thai place, is of course, the Pad Thai.  A very reasonable serving size of Chef Nuit's Pad Thai w/ Chicken set to 'medium' hotness gave it a pleasant kick after taste, which I washed down with, once again, another classic bench mark the Thai Iced Tea.  The Pad thai's distinctive flavour was evident and not overwhelming, and I was happy to taste that the medium spice level didn't take away from it too much.  The Iced Tea was velvety and sweet, but I could've done without half the glass being filled with ice shavings.  

Overall, Pai is \"facelift\" on the old Khao Son Road, but with the same nostalgic taste.  The larger seating capacity and reliable food quality will have me coming back."}
{"text":"great food. I just wish the cost was the same as in Thailand, but that is just wishful thinking since we are in Canada,"}
{"text":"Finally revisited place and it was a fantastic choice.  This time around, I tried their spring rolls as starters and then their Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork as my main.  And both were absolutely amazing.  The spring rolls were nicely crispy and not greasy at all.  And the pad gra prow was a fantastic mix of crunchy (from the crispy pork skin), hot, spicy, sweet, and sour with herbal undertones due to the addition of Thai basil.  It was quite possibly the finest Thai food I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"The food was good (snacks and starters). We didn't eat a main dish due to the poor customer service. Atmosphere is great with good music. We were seated at a small cramped 2 seater table, so we asked for a bigger table top. The host was slightly perturbed by our request! And stated that they were expecting a bigger party for the table, although he unwillingly obliged he wanted to know how long we would be staying... really! We noted other patrons being served before us although we arrived first. Furthermore I over heard a waitress arguing with the patrons at the table next to us. poor poor customer service!"}
{"text":"the wait time to be seated is insane, and once you're seated good luck getting served, or getting water even. This place is way too busy. The food is good, but not worth the wait and the slow service. I stayed thirsty the whole time because it was hard to wave down a server to get water.

I've gad the coconut curry and the khao soi beef, both pretty good, although they were really sweet. But we avoid coming here because of the wait (and before you call, no, they DON'T take reservations)."}
{"text":"One of the best thai places in Toronto. Super cool vibe and great food!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and they said they only had the tables where you kneel available but there was around 6-7 tables free.  Tables were still free when we left so I don't know what they were saying. Only reason I am giving this place such a low score is that I had the worst stomach ache after.  I did enjoy the food when I was there.  I got the Khao Soi and the Pad Gra Prow.  Price is on par with the likes of Khao San Road which I prefer.  Service was not up to par as well.  Slow servers that keeps forgetting things and they didn't have the mango sticky rice as well when I was there. It was only 7pm on a Friday night.  Was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the bar on a weekday. Tom Yum soup was really good and different with a spicy red base. The Pad Thai was tasty but most of the noodles were clumped together in the center. I gave up a quarter of the way in. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish. I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! This place is legit! It has become super popular so the wait is a little long so usually I go a bit earlier and they text you when the table is ready. 

The food is amazing! We had the squash fritters and spring rolls to share. I had the green curry in a coconut...wow! The coconut inside is amazing, don't forget to eat that part! 

The staff are super friendly. The Thai ice tea is one of the best I have ever tasted (including in Thailand)

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of the best pad Thai places in the entertainment district.  I had the Pad Thai here and it tasted extremely fresh and delicious. It's not made from the usual sweet and sour looking red sauce at the Chinese run restaurants. You can really tell they use good ingredients here. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The experience was the complete opposite of my expectations. Was imagining a quiet, fancy-ish authetic Thai establishment with mindblowing food.

There's a patio but the inside of the restaurant is like a basement, loud music and dark, quite westernized. The whole vibe is very casual, all the servers are wearing their summer clothes aka cargo shorts and runners.

Menu prices are very steep, around $16-18 for a main. We got the Chiang Mai Beef Noodles and Chicken Drumstick Khao Soi, both less than averag even when price is not factored in. Both proteins were dry...never had dry dark chicken meat before. Beef noodles definitely had a larger profile of flavours and was mildly spicy. Khao Soi was the reason we came and it was a disappointment. Didn't like the noodles and the bowl seemed quite boring, just noodles after noodles in curry.

Service: There were a lot of staff but yet hard to get anyone's attention. Had to wait a couple mins before one server came over so that we could tell him our order was wrong."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had! The drinks are delicious, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is awesome! 

Anyone I've taken here or recommended this place to has always agreed."}
{"text":"We went to PAI on a Friday evening, around 7:30, and it was packed! Despite how busy it was, we were seated immediately which was a nice surprise.  At the recommendation of my boyfriend, who has been a fan of PAI for a while, we ordered the Khao Soi (with beef), the Chef Nuit Pad Thai (with chicken), and the vegetable spring roll starter.

All the food was DELICIOUS. We got the pad thai with medium spice and it was so yummy, not overpowering at all. In future, I'd probably get the Khao Soi myself since it was my favourite of the three. Unfortunately, we didn't get to try the mango sticky rice which I heard was incredible so I'll definitely have to go back for it. 

The portion sizes were very large (tons of leftovers!) and the service was prompt and friendly. My only complaint was the wait time for our main dishes which was about 40 mins. It wasn't the end of the world, especially since the restaurant was super busy, but we were starving. 

Overall, I loved all the food and the ambiance. I'm really looking forward to trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious. Been here a few times and continue to go back. Drinks are reasonable. Service is courteous and speedy. I would recommend getting their early for lunch (11:45) otherwise you'll be waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! The atmosphere is just amazing. The service can be a little slow at times but its definitely somewhere you need to check out. I had the thai iced tea and the chicken pad thai and both were absolutely delicious. The spice level is definitely quite high here so beware!!"}
{"text":"The only thing that has been consistent here is their Tom Yum Soup. Not a big fan of their green curry or khao soi. Their pad thai is pretty good if they get your spice level right. All in all, if you like tom yum soup and pad thai, come here. If you like curries, go to Khao San Road."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch. I've managed to sneak in during peak hours somehow! Chef's pad thai has a nice amount of cilantro flavour and a subtle street-style pad thai sauce. Beware of the potent curries if you are sensitive to spice / have stomach acid issues. I can handle a sriracha level amount of spice but the beef curry I had was a bit more intense than that."}
{"text":"My new favourite Thai restaurant hands down.

Came here on Friday around 7. The place was packed when we walked in but we immediately loved the vibe. It was a 30-45 minute wait so we left out phone number and they texted us when our table was ready. Make a reservation and save some time.

Service was fantastic. Our waitress was so friendly and gave us tips on our upcoming Thailand vacation. She gave us a ton of attention even when the place was packed.

I filled my Pai hole with Grabong (appetizer) and Pad Gra Prow (main). Both were out of this world. I wish I could eat it everyday. The cocktails were okay in my opinion but they did name their drinks after Toronto Raptors player because the owners are big fans.

Finally the decor made this place. I felt like I was actually in a Restaurant in Thailand. Everything from the washroom to the take out stand was perfect.

Don't go to this restaurant because it'll make it harder for me to get a seat for dinner the next time I go! Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"We just came off of a 6hr flight and had to get something into our system. We found this spot on yelp and didn't bat an eye. Northern Thai five minutes walk from the hotel. There was a line from the door to the hostess however it moved quickly and we were seated in roughly ten minutes. We ordered spring rolls, starter Tom yum soup, grabong, Gaeng Kiaw Wan, Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork belly and we shared everything. Amazing meal. Great service and when they ask if you want spicy I suggest, even if you are a pepper connoisseur, maybe take the spicy level below the top of the meter. I can handle hot spice being from the Caribbean but they aren't shabby in that department. The lychee juice was really nice as well. Service was great. We will be back. Also want to note that some extra folks joined us after the order was taken and the kind host didn't bat an eye and accommodated everyone as if they came at the same Time. Great downtown Toronto spot."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday evening with some co-workers. We were a fairly large group with a reservation, so we were taken to a side room. I should note that there were quite a few people who were waiting.

The seats were pretty close to each other, so it allowed for more intimate conversation. The waiter was really nice, letting us take our time to order. 

The food took some time to come out (partially due to both how hungry we were and how large the group was), but everyone's food came out at the same time. It all looked, and tasted, delicious. The meat in the Khao Soi was tender. The soup at the end was a nice touch.

I'd definitely come again, but I'd be wise about the time, as it can get busy quickly."}
{"text":"My fave restaurant. I like going to the Market as there are no lines (whereas the restaurant always has a line). I've tried most of the dishes at the market and the green curry is my favourite.

I also like to enjoy it with a Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"The service is amazing, the waitress was very attentive. The food was even better, it came out in large portions and for the right dishes, they came out hot. The food was absolutely delicious, it was that flavour kick I expect from Thai food. The price is fair for the quality. Their drinks are delicious, though a little weak. Overall, I loved the food and ambiance. 

Word of advice: make reservations or come early, the lineup gets crazy long starting at 6pm."}
{"text":"Food Quality - Great
Menu Design - Good - mostly the same
Service - Fine
Decor - Fine, but unique
Location - Hidden, but good
Price - Fair

Best/second best Thai in the city."}
{"text":"Another solid Thai restaurant. However since they all seem to have almost the same menu everywhere in these new spots (and similar taste) not sure how to rate these anymore. This is a much better setup than the other offerings. I mainly stick to either the Pad Thai or Khao Soi with beef. They are good as always and I also appreciate that they have Delerium Tremens beer which goes well with the food. The wine prices are decent as well.
3.5 stars as its a given that most of these Thai food places taste the same."}
{"text":"One of my favourite thai places always busy so i order delivery instead! Pad Thai with Shrimp, Khao Soi with Chicken, Pad Gra Prow with Pork are my go-to dishes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love PAI - I have visited Thailand a number of times and I would say food from PAI is super authentic ! They are always so great and accommodating when it comes to being vegan or vegetarian! Must orders - pad gra prow, morning glory (my favourite) , phad cha het for vegans (spicy mushroom dish). The spring rolls and squash fritters are great options for veggie appetizers ! :)"}
{"text":"Based on the reviewed, I though having to try this spot. Especially as I have made great experiences in this area before. 

The restaurant itself is a smaller square footage and below ground (as typical here). The interior is nicely designed and the music adequate for the surroundings. 

I had Tom Yum soup, spring rolls and Khao Pad Thamada with shrimp as a main. Personally I would just come back for the Tom Yum which was out of the world!! Spring rolls were well prepared and tasty as well. The Khao Pad was a recommendation by the staff (staffs favorite), overall it was quiet tasty but have expected it to be more saucy (it was quiet dry) but very great in flavor! Overall the staff was very professional, ingredients of high quality and the preparation great. Can only recommend trying!!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely worth the wait!! We arrived on a Sunday evening at 6pm. By 6:30 the lineup was up the stairs and almost out the door!

I started with the Thai Iced Tea!! The drink was really strong and concentrated, which is great because there was tons of ice to balance it out. A great start! Was really sweet as well, so I guess it depends if you love sweet drinks or not.. 

As an app we had the squash fries.. im not sure what they were actually called as my friend ordered it but they were squash fries and it was amazing!!! I could probably just have that dish for dinner. It was huge!!

For my main I had the chicken pad Thai! Of course I had to try the pad Thai! It was amazing!!! The portion wasn't very big but every bite of it was absolutely delicious! It was savoury, sweet, a bit sour and you even get to choose the level of spiciness! What wasn't to love about it?!? I would say it is a must try here!"}
{"text":"Had the spring rolls, fried rice w/ veggies, pad thai w/ chicken, and khao soi w/ beef.  Standouts were the spring rolls and the khao soi (that curry sauce is so damn good).  The pad thai was really good but I've had others on par and the fried rice was good but nothing crazy (although the veggies choice might have contributed).

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This would be my other recommended thai restaurant other than Khao San Road. Taste great and really can't go wrong with anything. The restaurant is pretty dark and loud, speak up if you want to be heard!

This time I had the ox tail curry while my S.O. got the thai fried rice. The curry is flavorful, though it does kind of remind me of Jamaican ox tail (nothing wrong with that though really). The thai fried rice great as well. Similar to Chinese style fried rice but with the addition of shrimp/crab paste. Squash fritter good as always especially the dip, though I wish it was a bit crispier.

The only odd thing that happened was the entrée came out pretty much right after we started our appetizer. Felt like we had to rush eating before the good gets cold.

Atmosphere - 4/5 
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Best food in Toronto hands down! This is my favorite place to eat and my default for impressing someone! We come here as often as we can and have ordered pickup multiple times. The Grabong and Khao Soi are absolute MUSTS! It's hard to get a table but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious as usual, service is good for how busy it is. The place loses a star because it can get crazy loud on weekend dinners to the point that you're pretty much yelling at each other to talk across the table. The inability to enjoy the company of your friends takes away from the dining out experience. But otherwise, great food and would go back for a quick lunch where I don't really need to talk to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here a few times and Pai never disappoints. Basically everything is flavourful and well cooked, especially the pad thai. The atmosphere is nice. Got food delivered once - took about 30 minutes and all the dishes were hot."}
{"text":"This was maybe the best Thai food I've had. Lots of interesting dishes and they were all pretty tasty. The bar and wait staff were all very nice and the drink while waiting for carry out works well if it's too busy to eat there.

Among other things, the variety of dishes with eggs, like the Thai Omelet, are really good and very different from your typical Thai place."}
{"text":"The wait for a Wednesday night was long but understandable given the small space of the restaurant. The place is crowded meaning patrons waiting their table will be (im)patiently watching you eat from the sidelines, so eat quickly and don't hang out after your meal! Overall I had no complaints but nothing stood out as exceptional to me. 

The menu is simple--about a dozen traditional main entrées, about a dozen appetizers, and dessert of the day. The Northern Thai sausage platter appetizer was an unexpected item - it reminded me of steamed Chinese preserved sausages but with more grit and lemongrass. The bean paste sauce that came with it was tasty but didn't tip me over the scale of wanting to order the app again. The green curry served in a coconut was fragrant and satisfying, the option to select spice level suits every palate. The accompanying bowl of jasmine rice was a good size to go with the curry, but on the dry side. 

A decent selection of beers and other drinks are available, which suits the casual and \"ethnic\" atmosphere well. The Thai iced tea is a crowd favourite and many patrons ordered one as they waited for their table - it's on the sweet side but complements perfectly with the spicy menu."}
{"text":"They have near-perfect reviews for a reason. It is one of, if not, the best Thai restaurant in Toronto in terms of food, atmosphere and service.

Expect to wait for 45mins-1 hour if you don't have reservations. You can always chill by the lounge until you get seated.

Great spot for a date or just with friends. Very casual place and the servers are easy going.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Interesting clashing atmosphere. Pad Thai was done very well with just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad Gra Prow and I love it. It's honestly so tasty and dish is filled with many flavours of sweet, spicy, and savoury. Definitely better than Khao San Road, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We came here during lunch but we're fortunate enough to be early enough to get to the restaurant before lunch hour rush hit. We didn't have a reservation but were seated on a high table by the kitchen. We ordered three dishes: pad thai ($13); Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup ($13) & Khao Soi Braised Beef ($13). The paid thai and the khao soi were actually quite good and we would return for these dishes; however the chiang mai beef noodle soup wasn't all that amazing. The taste was okay but it bore similarity to the khao soi but the khao soi definitely shone through."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. The place is busy, so we were grateful to have had a reservation."}
{"text":"Truly wonderful experience here as I ordered one of their more popular dishes - the Chef Nuit Pad Thai for $15 (well worth it as portions are a full-sized plate ~ trust me, it'll feel as though you've eaten a lot however the plate still looks as if you haven't touched a thing lol) The Chef Nuit Pad Thai comes as stir-fried noodles in their home-made tamarind sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, coriander, fresh lime and home-roasted peanuts and your choice of chicken, beef, pork or tofu and veggies - quite a selection.. I went with beef. This dish contains oyster sauce and for a couple bucks more you can add shrimp. My method was satisfying!

The food in itself was absolutely delicious! This is coming from someone who never eats Thai food on a regular basis; nor do I care to order pad thai's when it's on the menu and let me tell you why - some odd years ago I ordered a pad thai for take out and it was dry to the BONE. The dish had peanuts on it which is fine and all, but WOW it just added to the drought even more. Since then, no reason to bother with ordering such a complicated dish because I thought that's how all pad thai's tasted... until Pai. There was flavour, 

Service was incredibly friendly, informative and attentive! Our server was this Asian guy - seemed Filipino to me - however, he was VERY knowledgeable on our dishes, referred me to the special as I was new to DECENT pad thai's after my past regretful stint, and he remembered my seat since I switched to another side of the table (was with a group). At the end of the night when I tipped him he even bothered to ask if I wanted my five cents back, HA! Such honesty! LOL.. 

Anyway, the place is quite loud during peak dinner times, however the atmosphere is genuinely authentic, unique, and interesting. I will definitely recommend and be back!"}
{"text":"My first dinner of our Toronto Downtown Trip!! Love the Ambience!! And all the dishes is equally great!! The best pad-thai I had in North America!! The only downside is the waiting time! Go early!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! One of the best places in Toronto to eat Thai food. The waits are usually long depending on when you go; weekends I would assume longer wait times. But the wait is definitely worth it!

The first time I went here I tried their Pad Thai which is their specialty and the pork skewer as an appetizer. So delicious. The second time I came here I tried the coconut curry with chicken as I knew it tasted so good. They are true to their heat level as you can choose which spicy level you prefer. you can also request for the chilli oil sauce on the side. 

Definitely will come back here again!"}
{"text":"I've tried both Pai and Khao San Road numerous times, and while I want to give Pai 4 stars I've just always liked my experiences at Khao San Road. Here's a breakdown of why:

Food: Hands down, the pad thai at Khao San Road is more flavorful and consistently yummy. The one at Pai was a little more mushy (overcooked noodles?), and last time my friend received a clump of noodles all stuck together as if it had been sitting out for way too long. Totally not impressed by the noodle dish that's sold for $17. Moving on from that - the green curry at Pai will always win in my heart. It tastes authentic and is served in a coconut shell - ask for spicy if you're into that because the baseline for this dish is very mild/medium! I've heard that the Khao soi is also really good at Pai, but I've only had it at Khao San Road so can't comment. 

Drinks: Pai has a more extensive alcoholic drinks menu, and during the Raptors post-season playoffs games they even had Raptors themed cocktails. Not sure if that's still a thing now that we lost again. HOWEVER, the Thai iced tea at Khao San Road is much yummier and creamier. The one at Pai is filled with ice to the point where it feels like you're drinking a slushie. Yuck. 

Service: ok, this is arguably the most important part of dining out (besides the food). My experiences at Pai have always varied... from good to sub-par. Last time it took 45 minutes for my food to arrive on a Thursday, and all the restaurant did to compensate was give us ONE dessert to share amongst FOUR adults. Why even bother to attempt to act like you're compensating at that point? 

Pai, there was a time when I really loved you but now Khao San Road just really has my heart. The only reason I'd come back to you is for your green curry!"}
{"text":"Awesome pad thai and peanut skewers. Sake went well with the food and servers were very cordial and nice. Highly recommend this place to seekers of good thai food in a pub like ambiance."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! Make sure to get your reservation ahead of time -- or do what we do: Come during the off hours. Took a cousin who is vegan -- and absolutely loved being able to order freely. Fun vibe and great date spot (even if it can get a little loud...)"}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT! My boyfriend and I came here from Buffalo. Tried to make same day reservations but unfortunately was booked so we decided to take a chance and wait in line because we read such awesome reviews. We waited in line for about 10 minutes, put our names in, was told it would be a 25 minute wait but instead was only a 2 minute wait. Got seated right at the bar. Ambiance was amazing. Drinks were fantastic (amazing sangria). And food was to die for. The curry could not have been better."}
{"text":"Love the flavour, the food, but hate the wait for this amazing food!

No question Pai is amazing. I've tried a few dishes here, I love the khao soi, spicy and flavourful. It's this curry soup with crunchy noodles. Seriously good! You can adjust the spice level to your preference.  The pad Thai is a safe bet, and also very good. The prices and portion sizes are great. It really Tastes authentic!

The Thai ice tea here is great. I get it every times

The place is popular so be prepared to wait. You definitely can't find this food out in the suburbs."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience. The place captured the beach essence perfectly. We ordered pad thai noodles and green curry (thai spicy). It was a bit too spicy but i still really enjoyed it. Between the 2 options, I would recommend going for the \"foreign spicy\" instead of \"thai spicy\". This is one of the most authentic thai places I've been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is my favourite thai restaurant in Toronto, and many people share the same sentiments... which is why you should be prepared to wait a while before you can indulge in the food! Service & atmosphere is always good. I usually order their green curry with chicken which is served in a coconut. It comes with rice on the side as well as a small bowl of extra curry that didn't make it into the coconut. The curry is so flavourful! I really like the bamboo shoots, green peppers, and basil inside too. Paired with their thai iced tea, you can't go wrong. I've heard great things about their khao soi as well - I've been meaning to try that but I always end up with the green curry that never fails me."}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai spot with amazing energy - classic dishes are great and won't disappoint your craving. 

It can be a bit crowded and noisy - staff is hit or miss on service as it gets busy."}
{"text":"I was on here few days ago for birthday treat with some friends. We had some drinks with chicken. It's really awesome time we passed here also the foods were really delicious and testy. I'm using this restaurant since 5 years till now. Main thing is there are amazing place which is turning me for  Pai Northern. The environment always quite and silent. Don't think about price because it's always reasonable. I was always getting fast and bested service but this time i am little bit worried by their lacking of service. The boy was not friendly and not professional i think. I called him three times for asking about menu but he was never followed, also don't follow our direction perfectly which i really don't like.
By the way better luck for next time.!!"}
{"text":"Ohhh man, I am obsessed with Thai food. And Pai has been the best so far. It's so great I keep telling my partner that we are having take out Thai for both the wedding rehearsal dinner and after the ceremony, not kidding.

The larb was super delicious and so were their spring rolls and the yellow curry and the pad Thai. They also had that iced tea which you want to order at least 3 times. 

To finish off, order the mango sticky rice and you will not regret any over-eating."}
{"text":"Had the sweet potato appetizer and that came with an dipping sauce and both were awesome.  Also had the Panang Curry with shrimp & rice.  I found it a touch on the sweet side but still had good flavour. My friends both ordered the Pad Thai and I tried it and found it to be very good.  Next time I go, I would opt to have the Pad Thai instead."}
{"text":"I've tried almost everything on their dinner menu never leave disappointed! If you're going to drink something, I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place after reading all the fantastic reviews. Now That I have tried it, I feel responsible to write a real review.  

A underground small space pub like environment. Extremely loud, comparable to the loudest sports pubs in Toronto, not a family/kids friendly atmosphere (went on a Sunday eve). It's a great place for people in their 20s and under: comfortable with not hearing each other to avoid two-way conversations. It was busy. Service resembled a southern Chinese restaurant on Spadina, except they didn't throw plates at you.

Tried the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Tofu & Veggies with Thai spice level. Food came on time.
Overall the taste wasn't horrible and had a great texture. It was overly sweet, a ton of sugar went into the dish. The Thai Spice level, considered the spiciest level you can order barely tasted spicy. I estimated about 1 thai chilly went into the dish. I normally prefer about at least 8. My home-made pad thai is 100x better, with a ton more flavours and a lot less sugar. 

Will not return for the food, noise/atmosphere, price nor the service."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Pai looking for a place to eat. Was excited to be there because we could never get a reservation. Sat at the bar and were delighted with the service. The food was excellent. Spicy. Fresh. Delicious. The place filled up faster than a bucket of water in a rain storm. Great vibe. Great food. Left feeling full and satisfied. Go eat here if you want fun times and good food."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in town for the actual food. The waiting is always a killer though and the seating is too tightly packed. Service can be meh. If they moved to a nicer, bigger location with a better ambiance and service, I'd give em 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best food in Toronto. We go here every time. Must get the Mango Sticky rice dessert. It's divine."}
{"text":"This place is popping! Super lit but not actually it's dim lighting. Be prepared for the high key line. It's worth it because you'll be saying bless up with DJ Khaled when you start chowing down. Ya man. Food is moist. Broth is for real and chicken is clutch. Stay classy my food snobs."}
{"text":"Surprenant endroit! Rue déserte; j'étais persuadé que le restaurant était fermé. Nous entrons; c'est au sous-sol; l'endroit est plein, un samedi à 13h00. 

J'ai vécu 2 ans en Thaïlande et c'est la première fois que je mange, ici au Canada, une nourriture Thaï si authentique. On y sert la nourriture de rue comme le Pad Gra Prow (poulet au basilic thaï avec un oeuf frit). C'était délicieux. Première fois également que je mange des morning glory â l'extérieur de la Thaïlande. 

Hautement recommandé! Très très jnnb. bruyant. Décor invitant."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Friendly staff who would ask if everything is fine. 
Loved the Thai iced tea! Even tho there is lots of ice, the taste doesn't get diluted.
Green curry with chicken is not contained in a coconut shell for lunch cuz its cheaper. 
I would return to find the Wow factor

update:get-together wiz friends, perfect dinner! love northern Thai sausage. Must try thai iced tea."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's always packed! The thing I like about Pai that's different from Sukho Thai and Khao San Road is that they take reservation (unless that has changed recently).

As a party of three, two of us got chicken pad thai with medium spice and my other friend tried their Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. We also shared a thai iced tea which was comparable to authentic thai iced tea you could get in Thailand (according to my friend).

Overall, I thought the food was quite delicious and flavourful. 

During my other visit, I tried the Pad Gra Prow which I actually really enjoyed as well. I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"There's not much to say - this is the best Thai place in Toronto. I live in Etobicoke and it's just worth going all the way to downtown to eat here rather than go to any of the Thai places in Etobicoke. Their chicken Pad Thai is almost perfect, and the Tom Yum soup is the best in the city by miles."}
{"text":"Pai is brought to you by the same people from Khao San Road and Sukho Thai.  Due to various circumstances, they are no longer affiliated with KSR.  (I hated the ridiculous line ups there anyways.)

This location is currently on a soft launch and there has been little to zero media attention.  You're only going to know about it through word of mouth, or a walk-by.  However, word is going to get out really fast and the lines will be inevitable.  

The food is delicious!  Tons of flavours, spices, and levels of heat.  Noodle dishes, rice dishes, vegetarian fare...  Something for everyone.  

Friendly and helpful service.  No liquor license as of yet but soon to come.  

If you want authentic Thai food, give this place a try.  You won't regret it.  

Why 4 stars?  I want to check out the full menu."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Food and service is horrible. We ordered 8 plates and none of them were any good, not only that but plates arrived on the table stone cold. The rice dishes tasted like they were cooked days ago, and the curries had grease floating on the top of them. We seriously left this place with the dishes untouched and when we told our waiter we were ready for the bill and no we didn't want to pack anything up to go he asked why and I told him honestly for the wait and the hype we didn't really like it and explained other things about the crappy service to him and he just said \"oh well, I heard enough complaining today\" and gave us the bill in full, when I was going to pay I told him wow your answer was rude I should have complained to a manager long ago he said \"I am the manager\" I don't know if he was saying the truth but oh boy, what a shame."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!  We've been there twice in the last week.  Can't wait to go back for more.  Make sure you leave room for dessert.  The seasonal mango sticky rice is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really love their green curry!
Mango sticky rice is a must try!"}
{"text":"Off the charts!  What a surprise and definitely will be eating there whenever I am in town!  Service was off the charts and company was made a believer in Thai food!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!! 

I loved having another piece of this pai !! 

I finally got to dine in. This place gets filled quickly
So reservations are highly recommended.   

You can sit at the bar or have your own table. The first time I say at the bar and the bartender, Peter, was friendly funny and made great drinks!!!!  But if you get a table, try to sit at the back and you can go shoeless!!!!  We sat on an elevated area and had to remove our shoes. We had comfy matts to sit on and the table was at a good height.  From the back you get a great view of the restaurant. The ambiance is an authentic casual Thai vibe with retro cool decor. 

The server was quick and knew the menu inside and out!!  

The food: chicken satay was yummy, but could have been more meaty....came with two sauces: peanut and cucumber!  Mains: green coconut curry was rich with flavours and the pad graw praw was nothing less. Spice was perfect !!!  Thai ice tea was smooth sweet and cold :) 

To finish: we had some simple jasmine tea. Whole experience was comfy and yummy :)"}
{"text":"- good ambience
- great service
- fresh, delicious food. Strong flavours, well executed.

Will be back for sure.  Hope it doesn't get Khao San crazy."}
{"text":"Pai is one of the best Thai restaurants in the city, and my favourite place to meet up friends for lunch in the financial district. 

There's no shortage of amazing Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto. There's Sukhothai, Sabai Sabai, Khao San Road, Nana, Salad King and of course Pai. 

There's pros and cons to each of the above Thai restaurants but Pai is a fan favourite because of the vibe, the ability to make reservations and the location. I come here very often for lunch, because I find their lunch chicken pad thai for $12.50 to be a great deal. 

At Pai I have tried-

Chef Nuit Pad thai: Tied with Sukhothai for the best pad thai in the city. Delicious. Make sure you mix it up while it's still warm and add the lime! The lunch version of this is just as big as the dinner version, but the lunch one is cheaper. 

Khao soi: This dish is amazing. It comes with Khao Soi gravy/curry with soft noodles and fried noodles. It's a mixture of crunchy and saucy softness. Delicious. Their khao soi gravy is amazing with rice too. I ordered this for take-out lunch once (also cheaper than dinner but same size) and they give you a VERY generous portion of khao soi gravy. It comes in a huge container and I froze the leftovers to be used on lunches I brought from home. Best idea ever. 

Khao Pla Tawt: It's a fried fish with rice. The fish here is very crispy and delicious. The sauces that it comes with is great. It's an amazing dish to compliment the pad thai or khao soi. 

Mamasan braised beef: Not so good. Its a beef curry with rice. I dont think I like beef at thai restaurants. Even the Khao soi and pad thai dishes, I always go with chicken. The beef chunks at Pai are very hard and not juicy. I cant recommend this. 

Service here is good, but the kitchen is a little slow. It's very close to St. Andrews station. Come here for an amazing pad thai but make resos cause its very busy!"}
{"text":"Went to Pai when I was in the neibourghood with my boyfriend and we were craving some tasty Thai food. Pai was an easy choice as my friends and I have been here many times before. We arrived at around 5:30 pm on a weekday so a queue hadn't formed yet although the restaurant was quite busy. Got a table inside after 2 mins of waiting.

Food: For two people we order 3 appetizers, 1 main and find ourselves comfortably stuffed. The tom yum soup I had was a small one but very tasty, not like the watery serving you usually get at other Thai places. Perfect size for an appetizer. We also ordered Gaeng Panang - chicken skewers with peanut sauce and fish sauce, and Laap salad. The skewers were flavorful and moist and go perfectly with peanut sauce. Laap salad was also great but might be too spicy for some. For main we shared a Pad Gra Prow which is basil stir fried pork with rice. The basil pork is soo yummy I swear I could have finished it all by myself!

Drinks: Thai iced tea is always our go to drink at any Thai place, as we love spicy food the tea helps to re balance your taste bud and ease some of the heat that makes you cry :\") My bf tried the Thai mojito which was nice but he didn't think it goes well with the food we ordered.

Ambience: the place has a young and cheerful vibe and quite noisy, very relaxed.

Service: it was quite busy so was kinda hard to get our server's attention

Price: total damage came to $96 for two so yes it's a 2 dollar signs

Giving four stars only because I've had lot of exposure to authentic Thai - used to go to Bangkok every year just for the food. The food here didn't blow me away but in the Toronto food scene Pai is one of the best Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about Pai.

We came in just before the dinner rush on a Tuesday. There was a small wait but we got a table pretty fast considering it's popularity. We hadn't decided what to get just yet, when someone came to take our order. We told them we'd need a bit more time, but it became quite difficult to get anyone to take our order after that (eventually we did of course). 

We ordered the grabong, chef nuit pad Thai with beef, pad gra prow with chicken, and khao soi with chicken. 
The grabong was amazing! Really interesting to look at and had a great flavour and slight crunch. It's a great appetizer to share and tastes great with or without the sauce. I would definitely recommend trying this!
The chef nuit pad Thai was pretty good. Really nice all round flavour and not overly sour--a really good balance between sweet and sour! This was a favourite of ours as well.
The pad gra prow is where things begin going downhill. The rice was hard in some places--and not in the \"crunch bits at the bottom of the rice cooker\" way, but more like a stale \"we left this out on the counter for half a day\" type of way. The chicken and egg on the dish were very standard. The whole dish just felt very lackluster and sad. If you want to eat this, go to any Vietnamese restaurant instead.
The khao soi also had mixed feelings. The coconut curry itself was very delicious and rich--but almost too rich. It was definitely one of those foods that feel very heavy on the stomach after only a few bites. The egg noodles inside were also VERY soft--like it was overcooked and mushy. I think it would be better if the noodles were a little more al dente.

There are lots of hit and misses with Pai, which makes me hesitant to come back and try new items. The only thing I'm sure of is I would definitely recommend the grabong."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch excited to see what it was all about. I didn't foresee it being downstairs with a lively, somewhat loud, atmosphere. 

After the initial orders and having our food served I felt we were sort of an after thought and forgotten about. It may have been a shift change but that is really no excuse. 

The food itself was good but nothing super. The papaya salad was tasty but not quite spiced up to the level I expected. The panang curry had good flavor and probably a dish I'd order again."}
{"text":"So much hype around this restaurant and all totally justified. Given the crowd of people lining up outside, we were expecting at least an hour wait for the 3 of us but were told it would be around 25 minutes. I figured that was a gross underestimation but turns out it was pretty accurate. The restaurant has a lot more seating than I thought and they do a great job moving people through. Service is excellent!

I ordered the Khao Pla Tawt (crispy fish fillet with 2 sauces) and it was simply perfect. I have to say the atmosphere makes this place just as much as the food does. The entire restaurant is covered in decor that I'm pretty sure was taken straight out of Thailand. I'm trying to describe the vibe but I know my words won't do it justice. All I have to say is come here to experience it yourself!"}
{"text":"Came here on a chilly Sunday evening with my girlfriend. There was a lot of people there and we had to wait about 45 minutes. They take your number to call when your table is ready. It is a bit noisy in here with awesome hip hop playing and a hipster vibe. If you use the washroom you can learn Thai. The service was pretty quick but the food took awhile to come out. However it was busy so it was expected. We shared an order of the pad thai which we got foreign hot and it was extremely spicy but not unbearable. It was so delicious. It had great flavor and not the sour fishy taste i have experienced in other places. Best pad thai I have ever had. i got an order of the green curry that came in a coconut. i was not a huge fan of this as it had a licorice taste to it. It was presented well and it wasn't horrible but i would never get it again. It is a bit pricy but i think it's worth the experience. i would come back but maybe not go out of my way. Woohoo for my 100th review!"}
{"text":"Of all the places Hubby and I dined at in Toronto, this was my second fav where I liked the food. Even better than the 360 Degrees Restaurant in the CN Tower.  
We arrived at 6 PM and the place was packed. The wait was about 25 mins on a busy Friday nite. Not a good idea to sit outside. While leaving, we saw couples sitting at the outdoor tables with no one serving them. 
We tried 3 items. The fried egg rolls were OK and served with a tangy dipping sauce.  I wouldn't order again tho.  The beef curry had the most flavor with very tender chunks of cubed beef.  The chicken noodle dish was good but the beef curry had better flavor. 
I particularly enjoyed the Thai iced tea which had too much slushy ice in it.   Less ice and more creamy tea would be better.  By the time we left the line had stretched from the basement staircase to out the door.  Our server was very nice and the staff checked on us twice during the meal.  She told us she has been working there since they opened 2 yrs. ago."}
{"text":"Among the best restaurants in Toronto. Chill vibe, friendly staff, fun decor, tight jams and all that good stuff but god damn they food tasty.

- Moo Ping skewers and chicken wings are beautifully cooked (sous vided first for consistency I suspect) and flavoured 
- papaya salad with shrimp, tangy and salty and delish
- the name is uninspiring but you'd be a damn fool to skip the beef salad. A damn fool. I've seen them slightly overcook the beef once. Still excellent.
- Listen to me carefully. For your main, order exactly this. Beef Pad Gra Prow with Moo Grab Thai Spicy. Don't think to yourself, oh I know what I like, why not replace the Moo Grab wi- NO! STOP IT immediately and just do what I'm telling you to ok thank you.
- or actually they have this oxtail thing that's really good
- Pad Thai is good. Don't go to Pai and eat Pad Thai. Green curry is good too but like come on try something new
-Dranks wise- Thai ice tea will make your face smile, Plum Moscow Mule is the best Mule I've had

Protip- In the middle of your meal, put both your hands up, balance your drink on your chin and loudly exclaim, \"welcome to the court of owls\" (as is Thai custom), and the staff will bring you a secret off menu item.*

*please consult your legal team first I am not a doctor."}
{"text":"I've been to other Thai restaurants and nothing compares to this place. Pai is the number one Thai restaurant in Toronto, hands down the best. If you'd compare this place to a basketball player, this place is the Michael Jordan of Thai restaurants. I've tried every single dish they have on their menu and every dish is a 10/10. Whoever gave this place a bad rating, I'm sorry but your taste buds are not working properly."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and we split some chicken satay and battered shrimp.

Great atmosphere, apps were very tasty. Loved the peanut sauce with the satay, and there was a nice sauce with cucumber and chillies with it that was also very tasty. The shrimp was perfectly battered and crispy... Really tasty, and I'm not usually a fan of ordering shrimp unless it's part of dim sum. :) 

I will definitely have to come back here for a proper meal, so this review is just a placeholder for now."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in the downtown core. Ordered both the Beef Khao Soi and Masaman are both really good. Ensure that you make reservations before you visit as it gets really busy for walk ins. Be prepared for a good coma."}
{"text":"The food at Pai reminds me of what I had in weekend markets in Thailand. The interior design is very chic and the restaurant is quite big. I found the interior to be quite different among different sections of the restaurant, which is always fun. 

It's difficult to get in without waiting for a long time for dinner, but I find that if you arrive around 5:30, they can usually accommodate you."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food. I got the pad thai with chicken and medium spice. There wasn't a hint of spice and there was absolutely no kick at all - maybe I should have gone up a notch on the spice meter? The chicken pieces were nice and tender, perfectly cooked. The overall dish was on the greasy/oily side, but the flavours were nice and savoury, veering more toward the sweet/sugary side than spicy.

The garlic shrimp appetizers were the winner. At 6 pieces for $13, it's on the pricey side but they were so good and so worth it. Super crispy and paired well with the sweet chili sauce.

The Thai iced tea was pretty much highway robbery at $5.75 and filled with 50% ice - not worth getting. While it looks like the cup is completely filled, the smashed ice isn't noticeable until you take a few sips and realize you're halfway done your drink.

Overall, I'm glad I got a chance to try it but there's nothing that makes me want to re-visit."}
{"text":"Yeah this is as good as it gets.  I'm on a bit of a budget so I can't afford to come to places like this often, but wow.  You get your money's worth here.  I can't say if the food is authentic or not because I've never been to Thailand, but I know it's a hell of a lot better than Thai Express.  The ambience is rather hectic, as this place seems to get quite busy.  There's a pull up bar and a ton of seats.  There's even an area with pillows and a low table for what I'm assuming is \"traditional\" style Thai eating?  The service was alright.  I could tell the servers were busy and didn't really have time to chat, but they weren't rude either.  The food is where this place really shines.  I ordered the Khao Soi and my date ordered the green curry.  Both blew our socks off.  Not from spice, but from flavour.  I could have eaten that khao soi all day long until I died from rapid stomach expansion.  My date's green curry was served inside a coconut, which was pretty neat.  Best green curry we've had, and best Thai food we've had as well.  I want to come back here now!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Long line wait (for 6 people though) but so worth it. The host was very organized when seating tables. Cannot say enough good things about the masaman curry, tasted just like Thailand! Ended the meal with mango curry which was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Way too sweet. This is the worst and most over priced Thai food I have ever had. Do 99 percent of people have terrible palletee?"}
{"text":"Pai has the best Thai food in the 6ix area! Their Panang beef is super creamy and goes super well with white rice! I also recommend their coconut fried shrimp, it is super light and crispy, and the sweet and sour dipping sauce is the perfect match!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! I had the egg rolls and fried rice, and they were AMAZING!!!!! My friends got chicken pad thai and a beef dish.... any way... doesn't matter... all very delicious!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite thai restaurant !! The vibe, Ambience , music and food is just amazing! Only thing is.. it's really popular so try to make reservation. :)"}
{"text":"Rating: 3 1/2*

I finally made it here after having this restaurant bookmarked for the longest time. I was always intrigued with the outstanding reviews and wanting to learn more about Thai cuisine. 

We came here right after they opened at 11:30am on a Saturday. We were a party of three. 

I'll format this review based on the title of one of my favourite Western movies. 

The Good: 
I like the decor of the restaurant and the actual location. The way the restaurant is set up with the tables, the decorations and being in a basement, helps convey the feeling that you are somewhere in Southeast Asia. The restaurant is divided into a \"Kitchen\" and \"Market\" sections. The Kitchen section is the restaurant part. 

The washrooms are nice and clean although the Ladies one was out of service and you needed to go to the Market section. 

Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Shrimps at a falang spicy level was a great dish. The noodles were cooked right, there were a proper amount of shrimps and the spice level was appropriate. I like you can adjust the spice level in this dish. The Falang is the second spiciest with the Thai being the first. Also, you can order the Pad Thai with beef, pork, chicken or tofu if you want. 

The Bad:
The service was a bit lacking. The initial table that the hostess gave us was not convenient for us and we requested a different table as the restaurant was fairly empty at the time. She was not impressed and wouldn't let us sit at the back. We ended up sitting at the table right as you come down the stairs. Our initial waiter was good but after he took our order, he disappeared and we got different people serving us until we left. 

The Gaeng Klaw Wan with chicken dish was a bit disappointing. They state that the dish comes in a mild/medium spice level. It was a bit bland for us. The presentation was cute as the curry was served in a coconut. 

The prices are on the high side. Some of the dishes are not worth what they are charging for. 

The Ugly: 
Khao Pad Thamada with chicken dish which is basically a stir fried rice was not very good. The dish was so bland with no hint of seasoning or spice. I had better fried rice in a Chinese restaurant at a much lower price. 

Overall, it was an above average experience but I highly doubt that we be coming back to this place again.

{"text":"The taste of food is awesome! I'll will visit it next time. But there are too many people wait for the dinner. If u have interested it, u definitely should go earlier."}
{"text":"Really really good Thai food with a lot of vegan options. I got the vegan pad Thai and spring rolls. They were both really delicious. Their service was good and their patio is fairly nice. Their prices are a bit high tbh. We had two entrees, spring rolls, and sangria ended up being $70+"}
{"text":"OMG SO GOOD.  Had the green curry out of a coconut!  Delicious!  Service was impeccable.  My friend accidently splashed some sauce on her shirt so she wet her napkin in her water to get the stain out.  Within 30 seconds, our waiter showed up with fresh glass of water cuz he noticed she dipped her napkin in the first glass!  That is attentive service - take notes people!

Wish I could eat here everyday, it's amazing.  Better than the other thai restaurants in Toronto (I've been to a lot)."}
{"text":"Generally not bad, but how many times am I going to have to see this menu??

First Khao San Road, then Shabai Shabai, then Suhko Thai... now Pai??? I'm honestly so tired of these squash fritters, and the Khao Soi. Why does every place have the same damn menu??? This stuff was all so good a year ago, but now I'm just sick of going to each new location, hoping for something different and finding the same menu at each place. Everything was the same as every other Thai venture than this chain has undertaken, and each time I go to the next place, I find the sameness less charming. Am I boring you by being repetitive?

You get my point.

I don't know what I expected. Something different?

Edit: I thought it was only fair to actually give an account of my experience as well: The service was good. But they brought the pad Thai and the Khao Soi right after the fritters and there was no room on the table for our wine, wine glasses, water glasses and the food, itself. This is a pet peeve for me: If you're going to make me  sit at a tiny table, you'd better bring my food out in courses. Especially If I have a bottle of wine. I loved the whistling water bottle, but we had to keep it on the floor because there was no room.

Squash Fritters were not as light and crispy as I remember having at Khao San Road. Pretty greasy, actually. My friend ordered her Khao Soi Thai Spicy, but it was not. My noodles were really sweet. Everything was really just ok and unimpressive. I expected a lot more.  The Curry in a coconut looked cool. But felt a little gimmicky.

I think I'll stick with Khoa San Road."}
{"text":"MAKE. RESERVATIONS. 

Seriously. 

Pai does take walk-ins but believe me you want to make those reservations. Finally got to eat here on a Friday night. My friend and I decided to take a chance and grab a meal here before catching a movie. We get here for 6:30 and the line is out the door so we give our names and grab drinks at the bar. The place is jam packed so the wait was about 30 mins for a table for two. We get seated and our server is super friendly and helpful when recommending dishes.  We decided on the Khao Soi with chicken which tastes like heaven(!!), and Massaman curry with tender pieces of beef. 

We had about an hour to order, eat and head out for our movie. Seeing how busy it was I was little concerned that we might not get our food quick enough. However, our server totally had our back, we got the food pretty quickly and honestly it didn't take us long to inhale the food, or pay the bill which came to $50 for two people. Not bad!

I will definitely return but probably not when I'm on a deadline to eat. If you've never been here get the Khao Soi, dare I say it but it might actually be better than Khao San's."}
{"text":"I fell in love with a new Thai place that has forever changed the way my tastebuds will react to this category of food. And I promised in my other Yelp review I would have to change this one to reflect how good the new place is. Pai is still dope, but love is a b****."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Thursday. It was busy so we ate at the bar. The food was delicious and very flavourful. We ordered everything Thai spicy (we love very spicy food) but they punched it in wrong and everything came mild. It was delicious but with the spice I know would have been that much better for us. A little bit of a bummer 

Went today for take out as I had a craving...ordered my food and asked for it Thai spicy and one medium. Got there and she assured me one was medium the other mild. I asked them to remake the mild dish as this happened last time. I am now at home about to dive into this food and realized the medium dish is mild....again to disappoint after I waited and confirmed 

They would get 5 stars if it weren't for their lack of clarity. The food really is great and atmosphere is awesome highly recommended just make sure you clarify (maybe a few times) the spice level.."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 9pm - packed, but the wait wasn't too long for 2 (about 20 minutes). We ordered the papaya salad, stir fried morning glory, ox tail curry, and fried basa fillets with rice. The food was good in taste, but it's your typical basic Westernized Thai food joint. The fish looked and tasted more like fish sticks, the ox tail curry was sweet without much other flavors, and the papaya salad was only tangy and salty (missing chili flakes, garlic, and fish sauce maybe). Overall, our meal was missing the complex and strong flavors that we have tasted many times in Thailand."}
{"text":"Awesome environment, very friendly staff, and incredible food.  The curry in a coconut was awesome and a cool experience.  Also liked the squash fritters."}
{"text":"Fresh flavours, authentic tasting food in a laid back atmosphere. I always get the pad thai and really enjoy the green curry. I'm sure I'm missing out on the rest of the menu which also looks delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious meals, very well priced for lunch. The decor is fun and the waitstaff are friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"typical core downtown restaurant where prices and quality don't usually match. pad thai was very plain. when i looked at the dish, there was about 95% noodles, 3% bean sprouts and remainder was meat. tomyum soup tasted only tomatoes, lots of tomatoes. the high chairs were not comfortable at all. I didnt find the quality of the food justified the money I pay for."}
{"text":"Went to Khao San Road as a group of 6 only to find out it was closed for the long weekend. We instead went to Pai North and got seats on the patio. Just after we ordered food a storm blew through, but the waitress was kind enough to get us seats at another table indoors. 

The interior is roomy with island themed decor mixed in with random antiques.

Our food came out fairly quickly, even though the place was packed. I ordered the Pad Thai with Beef, with extra peanut sauce on the side. It was more curried than a normal Pad Thai and was fairly spicy for medium. Overall probably the best Pad Thai I have had in the city. 

Great value overall - will definitely be back to check out the other dishes."}
{"text":"I got the Pad Gra Prow and it was delicious! I added some crispy pork belly to the mix and found it to be amazing! The minced pork was seasoned perfectly and the egg was just the cherry on top!

Overall, great place and great atmosphere! It feels like a bar more, than a restaurant, which isn't a bad thing! I would love to go drinking there sometimes!"}
{"text":"Pai is one of two popular Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto. It's difficult to get a table, so I would recommend coming early, putting your name down, and then walking around the neighbourhood because the space to wait inside the restaurant is not very large.

A group of 4 of us waiting for approximately 45 minutes to get a table on a Saturday evening around 7/8pm. We ordered the Grabong ($14) to share among us four. Comprised of freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts, its a light dish that's enough to get your appetite ready for the main. 

I ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai as the main ($16.50) and it was a large serving that could have lasted me two dinners! It includes stir fried rice noodle in a home made tamarind sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. Choice of Chicken, Beef or tofu and veggies. Don't forget to get extra limes and peanuts on the side- I find it helps bring out the flavour!"}
{"text":"I'm now hooked. One of the top Thai restaurants in Toronto. The Khao Soi is my go to here, although I haven't had anything on the menu that was bad. Their cocktails are also solid. They used to have more Thai beer but it seems it's whittled down to just a few now. 

Can get pretty busy at lunch and right after work. Music is always on point."}
{"text":"This place is terrible please don't go I hate when I have to wait for a seat. Please just avoid it like the plague I love it so much don't go plz."}
{"text":"This place fills up for a reason; a group of us attended and were amongst a line up of a few others to get in for lunch. So, if you're trying to go with a bigger group, be prepared!

The counter to that caution is that it is well worth it. The place has an island vibe mixed with family memories and service to match. Our server was efficient and prompt. I chose the ceasar as a beverage and boy, it was tasty. We also tried the shrimp appetizer (yum) and I kept it basic and ordered a mild chicken pad thai. The portion was sizeable and I ended up taking the remainder home. Our group was moved to a small table near the bar after our server respectfully asked if we didn't mind moving... no problem there. We then got handed over to bar staff who were assisting. Those guys were friendly and knowledgeable about the drink menu.

The only caveat I'll throw in is that the menu is quite small, so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favourites a few years ago however, it's changed quite a bit due to its growing popularity. If you don't have a reservation, forget about it! I went here on a Thursday night and it was packed as expected. The ambience is still hipster-ish but the music was way too loud (I'm talking next to impossible to have a conversation loud). I ordered the chicken pad thai which I usually do and even though it still tasted delicious, quantity has reduced significantly. I was starving before I got here and was quite disappointed. C'mon Pai, I have faith in you!"}
{"text":"Delicious, flavourful and so creative! The green curry in a coconut was DELISH! My first time at Pai, and it did not disappoint! Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"As long-time, die-hard fans of Khao San Road, my boyfriend and I eagerly anticipated the opening of Pai. We had also recently visited Thailand, so visions of mangoes still danced in our heads. 

If you don't love the ambiance of Khao San Road (packed in like extremely loud sardines with a moustachioed hipster practically sitting in your lap), you'll enjoy Pai's spacious setup. The rusty Thai signs, homey carved wood and reggae music creates an entirely different feel. 

We shared the papaya salad which was appropriately spicy and served with chicharones and rice noodles. The portion was more than ample for sharing and was presented beautifully. My boyfriend had the Gaeng Hunglay as his main. Given the choice of oxtail and pork belly, he chose the former. Served with a bowl of rice and topped up with chopped chillies, he was one happy camper. I had the Pad Gra Prao with pork, which was divine. The presentation was a perfect stack with three components - rice on the bottom, pork in the middle and topped with a fried egg, Thai-style. Served with a little cup of nam pla and a stack of cucumber slices.  

Until this point I failed to mention that my boyfriend asked for a knife with his dish, and was informed that they did not have knives at the restaurant other than kitchen knives which they couldn't give him. We are very much aware that Thai food is usually just served with fork and spoon so this is perfectly acceptable. I have a feeling someone on Yelp will eventually complain about this, so let me inform you that when I see it on here, I will hate you for the rest of your hopefully short, meaningless life.  

I couldn't pass up an opportunity for mango with sticky rice for dessert. While the best I've ever had was undoubtedly at the Sukhumvit Soi 38 night market in Bangkok, we were extremely satisfied with the dish. 

Again, seriously ample portions, fantastic flavours, authentic details and two very happy tummies."}
{"text":"Save the money and time you would've spent here and take yourself down the block to Khao San Road. I had ordered the Pad Thai to go because a 45 minute wait seemed high unappealing. I started to eat it within of 5 minutes of receiving it and I was shocked. The taste was EXTREMELY weak and unflavoured. The flavour that was there, was good and had and the \"spicy\" level was okay. Overall, I wasn't as pissed just because I didn't have to suffer through the extreme pain of waiting in their line. Cannot justify the $18 I spent here."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Fast, FREINDLY service and amazing flavours make for the perfect downtown lunch or dinner. Pad Thai, Khao Soi, GREEN CURRY to live for.. Definitiely try it out!"}
{"text":"Whats going on Pai? The serving of pad kra pow keeps shrinking. As i was eating it, i didnt get the same great feeling i used to get when eating here-- that of having a generous, homecooked meal. The serving of the meat has shrunk and i had to, at one point, just eat the eggs with rice. My friend ordered extra curry sauce and was charged $3. I dont know Pai...i just hope you bring back the restaurant we used to know and not let fame pull you down."}
{"text":"I went to Pai with a group of six on one of the nights where TIFF was happening. As you can imagine, there were tons of people outside in line for the TIFF events. Fortunately we didn't have to wait long to be seated. We immediately ordered the Tom Yum Soup and Grabong. The soup actually wan's too memorable to me but the Grabong, which is this deep fried batter squash dish was amazing. I don't know if it was just that our group was super hungry, but we finished it so quickly that we ordered seconds right away. The garlic dip with the grabong was goodness in my mouth =) Would definitely get that every time I go. 

For my main I got the Pad Thai. This tasted super good and flavourful and out of all the places I have had pad thai at, this is definitely at the top. 
Most of us also got the Gaeng Kiaw Wan, which is the green curry. The rice actually came in a coconut so that was quite interesting. Based on their responses, it seemed that the dish was well enjoyed.

Server was very nice and overall, food came pretty quickly. Pretty noisy environment though so would recommend for gathering and casual dinner nights. Overall, would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I had the green curry here. It was okay to me. Maybe I'm just not too into Thai food in general."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, the atmosphere rustic, warm, loud yet homey, and the wifi password was on the drink menu! Loved the food and the spice level options, the waitress was kind and energetic along with the guy at the front organising the seating and reservations.

The only downside was that we had to wait a little under an hour for a table for 6, but I can't deduct a star for that; it's not their fault that people love the place so much."}
{"text":"We arrived for our on line booked reservation that turned out was moved....Strange,  but even though the place was packed they still sat us within 5 minutes.   
We had the spring rolls and fritters for the apps...fantastic.  then the green curry and chef neut pad Thai   probably the best I have had.  Service was fantastic and a lively place.  Will be back  good job!"}
{"text":"Amazing thai food! If you're a fan of SukhoThai, this is a must try! We ordered squash fritters, Green curry and Massaman curry. My favourite was the Massaman curry, though, very very hot! Be watchful that curry creeps on you! Nonetheless, absolutely delicious! The beef was so tender and juicy and the curry was full of flavor! Loved the ambiance, a little underground, hip spot. Portions are good and each dish is around $15. Can't wait to go back there! Oh, and be ready to wait 45 minutes to an hour if you go during the evening time or weekends!"}
{"text":"The pad thai was a very standard good, neither better nor worse than the pad thai I've had at more mainstream restaurants like Salad King or Spring Rolls. Frankly, I was more interested in the Grabong appetizer, vegetarian deep-fried battered squash fritters with garlic tamarind dip. If they fried it a tiny big longer to amp up the crispiness, it'd be better, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

The restaurant was a bit noisy for my liking. Particularly if you're only eating with one other person, I'm not a big fan of places that make conversation a little difficult. It wasn't unbearable, but a concerted effort to be louder was necessary.

No complaint with the service as we got everything we ordered at a reasonable speed. Paired with the alright food, Pai get's an a-ok, but I'm not sure I'd make an effort to go there again over another Thai restaurant closer by."}
{"text":"This place was suggested to my wife and I by some foodie friends on a recent trip to Toronto. Give yourself plenty of time. We waited about 30 minutes to check-in and another 30 or so to get seated. We were able to find a corner of the bar to grab some drinks for the wait. Great atmosphere and decor. Be sure to read the story behind Pai that is in a few places of the restaurant. Our food was really good and we left with full, happy bellies!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by first stating that I'm not a big fan of Thai food. Just a personal preference but my wife is eminently frustrated trying to get us to go to a Thai restaurant for dinner. Well, it was her birthday and she picked the restaurant so I couldn't say no.....and I'm glad I didn't.

Pai doesn't present itself as the typical Thai restaurant. In fact it reminded me of a lively bar in the tropics more than a Thai restaurant. It's LOUD in here, so if you're looking for a romantic dinner for two, keep looking.

It is, however, a lively fun environment where everyone from reception to servers are happy and friendly.

On to the food. We started with the Grabong (fried squash fritters) and chicken satay. The Grabong was a little on the heavy dish, as expected, but delightfully tasty and a great substitute for \"fries\". Chicken satay was a generous portion and featured peanut sauce for dipping. The chicken was tender and flavorful, not rubbery at all.

For our mains we ordered the Pad Gra Prow (with crispy pork) and Khao Soi. Mine dish was a tad on the salty side but the rice it was served with balanced out the flavors. My wife loves the richness of her Khao Soi and was overwhelmed by the portion size and tenderness of the beef. Both were ordered medium spicy which was more than adequate for the both of us.

Our dishes were washed down with Chang beer and a Thai iced tea that my wife couldn't get enough of.

Maybe I've never had \"authentic Thai\" or my palate isn't sophisticated enough but when I go for Thai it's only going to be at Pai or Khao San Road down the street."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, but its always been dificult to find places with good quality meals. 

I went to PAI today for lunch after being recommended it by my cooworker. As soon as we entered, we made our way down a few steps into a warm yet lively environment, where they played reggae in the background. The place was clean and acrually looked nice. We got seated quick.

My friends ordered said Pad Thai was delicious. I ordered my usual medium spiced Pad Gra Prao. It was sooo good. Excellent quality, and great amount - didn't over fill me.

I definately recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I tried their curry in coconut and asked for the spiciest level (Thai's spicy). I was quite underwhelmed because it was not as spicy as expected (despite the waitress asking multiple times if i was sure that I could handle it). Apart from lack of spiciness, it was a very delicious curry.

Then I asked for tom yum soup, asking for it to upgrade the spiciness even more. This time it was very spicy as I hoped. Despite its strong spiciness, other flavours were not overwhelmed. 

Overall, their dishes were very tasty. It was well prepared even though it was a very hectic Friday dinner hour. The service was very friendly and we were well attended despite high volume of customers."}
{"text":"This very well may be the best Thai food I've ever had! This was the first place that I had marked when I started planning my vacation to Toronto and I can easily understand how this establishment earned it's nearly 5 star rating with 1000+ reviews. I came with a group of 4 and everything we had tasted amazing. We tried the kung tawt (tiger shrimp) and tom yum soup for appetizers. Both were super flavorful and cooked perfectly. The tom yum was the tastiest that I've had in my life!
For entrees, we tried the pad thai, pad gra prow with beef, and green curry with chicken. Everything was spot on in terms of flavor with the pad thai being my favorite. It (like the tom yum soup) is the most flavorful pad thai I've ever had. If I could rename the dish, I'd change it to crack pad thai because I just wanted more and more of it. I actually ordered this pad thai again to go on my way to the airport because I just had to have it again before I left Toronto lol! 
The place is well decorated and really emulates the ethnic culture of Thailand. It's got a lot of trinkets to look at all over the restaurant making this an ideal place to take anyone coming in town to visit or a place to have an ethnic food adventure! This for sure will be one of the first places I hit up when I come to Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Khoi Soi was unbelievably delicious but salty. Can't say enough good things about their menu. Very inexpensive for what it is, especially considering its downtown location."}
{"text":"This place is quite popular and well worth the wait. Even on a busy night, the staff can accommodate an average size party in under 30 mins. The food is fresh and I love their take on traditional Thai cuisine. This place is a must visit for travelers and if I was local i would probably eat here on a weekly basis. Decor, food and staff are awesome."}
{"text":"Love it!! If you want Thai food like it's made in Thailand come here. Not pricey.  Nice ambience.  Loved the squash fritters!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in the city! The staff is amazing and the space is super cozy. All the food is top shelf!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for business and was really craving Thai food and this place was conveniently located to my hotel. Given, it was a Friday night at 6pm, this restaurant was PACKED. Good thing I was only eating by myself so the bartender hooked me up with a seat. I ordered the Chicken Wings for starters, delicious sauce. And then for my main course I ordered the Green Coconut Curry with Chicken. The presentation for the Curry was so BEAUTIFUL. It came in an actual coconut and served with rice on the side. Very Delicious.

The ambiance of this restaurant alone is amazing. Also, food is great! 5/5 would recommend if you're in the Toronto Area."}
{"text":"I luckily stumbled on this place after trying to take a friend to Khao San Road and discovering we would need to wait a long wait time. We walked around the block basically and stumbled into Pai. I instantly loved the atmosphere. It's this warm, inviting space in the basement of a nice old building. The lighting is right. Music is fun. Service is on point.

The Khao Soi is incredible. It's creamy, spicy, sweet, savoury. Everything good. Perfect for when you need some serious comfort food. The squash fritters are a great snack. The Khao Pla Tawt is some delicious light and tasty fried fish. 

I had a mango juice to go with everything and I just felt blissed out by food. This is place has great food with a great atmosphere. Check it out."}
{"text":"Quite average in terms of flavors and variety.. Service was friendly and fast but the food was just MEH.. We ordered the spring rolls and fried squash for starters and went for the Khao Soi and pad Thai as main dish.. We weren't too impressed and we kept reminiscing about Khao San! It's ok but not as good as Khao San used to be!"}
{"text":"Straightforward Thai food. I had the green curry with chicken, and it was solid."}
{"text":"Coma in for catering do not order take out. It will take you two hours and no one will answer the phone"}
{"text":"GREAT food! Got the Oxtail & the Minced pork with rice and was delish.

TERRIBLE service. Waiters are overworked and inattentive, host is overwhelmed and rude to guests. Kitchen forgot to send our appetizers before our main dishes so we got stuff in reverse order (but not spaced out so we had to scarf down our food to make room on the table).

Would go here again just for the food - it's worth it. But don't expect to be catered to!

Also FYI the dishes are huge, just get 1 main dish per person."}
{"text":"Great Thai place in Toronto. The menu was designed very well. Some dishes were out as we were told they ran out of the ingredients that got shipped directly from Thailand. Service was so great and the people were so friendly. Nice suggestions on what to order. 

I voted for Moo Ping to be the best dish of the day. The others were so great as well. The flavor of some dishes got tweaked a bit from what could be found in Thailand just to fit well with people' appetite here."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed!!! The resturant, just off of Adelaide, is small but got busy really fast on  a Saturday afternoon. I ordered their pad thai with chicken and was happy with how much chicken there was. The sauce on the pad thai was light, yet flavourful with just the right amount of spice. The noodles had great taste and texture. Overall, the pad thai was a great choice and worth trying. The beef curry was also great! The curry wasn't overly spicy and had a depth of flavours from the coconut milk and various spices. As well, the beef was tender and paired well with the rice. We also got the chicken skewers and were quite blown away with the house made sauces; a fish sauce with citrus fruits and a peanut satay, which were both amazing on the tender chicken and on their own. Seriously some of the best Thai food I've ever had, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place. The pricing is not the cheapest, but once in a while I'd treat myself by going here since it is so yummy. Great service, and the food tastes amazing! Very friendly to multiple dietary restrictions. Im a vegan and their vegan tofu pad thai is amazing."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful lunch experience at Pai, atmosphere was great, seating was smooth, food was flavorful, and decorations reminded me of Thailand. I strongly recommend this place for lunch or dinner, and I hope to revisit this restaurant again very soon!"}
{"text":"oyster mushroom (vegan) with purple rice was delicious! I also enjoyed the morning glory appetizer. I find the restaurant resembling to a home as deeper in the restaurant we ventured in, more books were shelved along the walls- very cozy."}
{"text":"Freaking
Amazing
Food 
..

Explains the long waits to get a table.. but so so worth it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars on Yelp so I had to try this place. I was in town last week and the line was out the door ALL NIGHT!  This week (Tuesday) I caught a short line, but if you are one or two only you can eat at the bar without waiting. If you want a date night, make a reservation. The bartender told me for Friday and Saturday they are booked a month in advance. I had the Pad Thai noodles (of course) and they were awesome. I paired it with a Ransack the Universe by #collectiveartsbrewery and they were yummy together. Beware though, if you ask for the noodles \"spicy\" they are SPICY!"}
{"text":"It is one of the best authentic Thai food places to check out for sure!  I tried out their Pad Gra Prow and the spice level was just perfect for me (tried the Farang Spicy or Foriegner spicy).   I liked the atmosphere there.  Just a heads up even with the reservations we had to wait good 20-30 minutes.  But it was worth the wait.  Only issue we had with our experience there was the staff member who waited us, she was not so customer friendly person and should be taught how to deal with customers! Despite that negative experience, overall great food!"}
{"text":"The green curry was killer, rich herbal goodness and creamy coconut milk. I did it with \"foreigner's level\" of spice as did my friend with his Khao Soi but both were mild to our tastebuds. I would not hesitate to order my food Thai spicy here!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in at Pai on a Tuesday evening and the place was happening! We grabbed some seats at the bar to avoid the wait. Despite the busy crowd, the service was quick, attentive and personal. The drinks and food looked and tasted great. Definitely worth a return visit and now I know to call ahead!

I had the Thai iced tea and the pad thai, my standard go-to for any first visit. They definitely hit the spot in terms of flavour, portion and price. Can't wait to try the other items next time."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food place in town. There are hit and miss in term of food quality. But overall I like this place.
-Curry rice is delicious. it is used a real coconut as a container, which is quite unique. 
- OX Tail is my favorite dish. It is a non spicy dish. 
-Thai ice tea is very sweet. It is too sweet for me and my friends. They could not do less sweet because they are premade already.
-Kao sai- I am very disappointed at this dish even tho most yelper love it. It is very thick and heavy. Coconut favor is too overpower for the rest of ingredients. 
--There  are always lineup if you come after 6pm. However, if you choose to sit at non alcohol area, wait time is less."}
{"text":"Pai has over 50 reviews already? Okay, Toronto really loves Chef Nuit and her Thai dishes. I'm part of the masses here. Completely casual and fun atmosphere that welcomes people of all ages. 

To start share the squash fritters (aka grabong) with garlic tamarind sauce or the papaya salad. I'll try boo kem next time as I hear it's a standout dish. Khao soi - still a satisfying bowl of yes.

At this point I'm not super excited, but rather content and appreciative that the Regular duo continue to provide reliable and tasty Thai food with this new venture. I look forward to the introduction of more Northern Thai dishes in the coming months."}
{"text":"The food that I have gotten to try has been tasty, but as a vegetarian (I do eat eggs and dairy, just no meat or fish), there are few options for me. Of all the restaurants that Chef Nuit helped to start, this one is the least vegetarian friendly and it's very disappointing as it seems there is no move to change that, despite telling me in the past (when I asked via email when they first opened) that they were \"working on it.\" I no longer believe this. I work nearby but hardly ever go here because of disappointing options for vegetarians or vegans."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We went to the restaurant at 5:30 on a Sunday and by looking at the front we thought it was maybe closed. As soon as we opened the door, you could feel the energy and hear the sounds of patrons dining. As we walked down the steps into the restaurant, we were filled with excitement! Not only was the food amazing, but it was served fast! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Anytime I try a new Thai place, the first thing I try is phad Thai with pork. It's a basic dish, so if a Thai place can't handle this simple dish, that tells me how good of a restaurant they are. This place has excellent phad Thai! Its green curry is pretty tasty as well, and served in a cocount shell appears to be perhaps the most popular dish served. It's located in a basement and relatively small, so expect a 30+ minute wait. At least while I was there they had some old school hip-hop for music, which I found enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, fun atmosphere and the best Thai iced tea I've ever had. I got there 6:45 on a Friday night, my dinner companion arrived at 7, and we were seated at 7:05 because this place is huge! We were seated in the back-back-back room which was full and decorated with rock, funk and jazz paraphernalia. 

I couldn't understand the musical choice: beautiful soul, funk and blues songs chopped in half and replaced with the next soul, funk or blues song. Was it a live DJ? Or someone who thinks of these songs as background created a song track thinking who cares that you only get half to two-thirds of each song? Mistake.

Other than that, a great place. Will return."}
{"text":"Decent portion. $15 -$18 main dishes. There's always a line up but we opt out of the alcohol section and got a table in 5 min, even tho they told us 20 min. Great ambiance, crab salad came with pork rinds and shrimp chips; my oxtail (odd thing to get at a Thai restaurant) was full of flavour and melted right off the bone.

Pai is officially going on the roster."}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Pai for lunch.

We got in early when they opened at 11:30, and within half an hour most of the restaurant was filled. Except the Pai Market. They don't take reservations for lunch, so it'll be a bit of a battle to get seats.

Now, if you're in a rush, there is the Pai market that I mentioned. It's a section in the back of the restaurant (go to the back and turn right) that offers a number of merchandise and ingredients for sale, as well as some lunch combo options separate from the regular menu. For $10, you can grab one item (might be like a curry, or a stir-fry, or something) with rice. Great if you don't want to wait in a huge line.
 
Since our group had made arrangements to get here early, we got seats.
Their menu is not too big: around 10 or 15 items in total. This should make ordering a bit easier.

I ordered a Pad Thai at Thai Spicy level. The waitress asked if I was sure that I wanted the thai spicy, just in case I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. It was definitely a bit spicy, as I could feel the heat on my tongue, but not dangerously spicy as others at the table had warned. But I think if you're not good with heat, it might be something to avoid.

The pad thai was alright. Not too greasy, and came with a generous amount of chicken.
The heat definitely makes it a bit interesting, though perhaps I should try it without as much spice next time to get more of the flavour.

20% auto-grat is applied on parties of 6 or more, which I'm not a fan of. In terms of service, it gets really really busy so they have less time to tend to your needs. I guess the auto-grat is meant to take that into consideration?"}
{"text":"Had a late (2pm) lunch here on a snowy day.  The food was excellent, obviously high quality and fresh ingredients that was well prepared.  Service was quick and friendly.

The music was excellent.  Not so far in the background that you couldn't make out what it was, not at all loud though.

The menu is limited - which is more of a benefit than a hinderance in my experience.  

I would love to go back next time I am in Toronto and would advise friends to visit."}
{"text":"One of the top rated places on Toronto and for good reason! I saw Pai had Khao Soi on the menu being that it's my favorite Thai dish and hard to find in Phoenix I made this a must try. I was with my classmates one  who is vegan and was a little worried that there wouldn't be many options for him, but there were plenty that could be made vegan on the menu. I wasn't expecting much as far as ambiance, but the restaurant was pretty trendy and a cool spot to hang out. They even had tables on the floor with cushions just like Thailand. The Khao Soi was as authentic as it could get, exactly like I had in Thailand. I will definitely return and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pai twice now and both times were amazing. I try to bring all my friends here. If it's Thai they are craving, it's Pai we are going to! The menu is straight forward and very cute. Their Khoi Soi is rich in flavour. I couldn't finish the entire portion so I packed to take away and mixed in rice and ate the rest for lunch the next day. 

I've also had the Pad Gra Prow. Personally I thought the portion size was a bit smaller than any noodle option but nevertheless still delicious. I need to try more on this menu, and maybe get dessert (Mango Sticky Rice) next time too. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A-MAZINGGG.  Alot of people are saying that this place is better than rhao san road in toronto, but I have to disagree. I still think this place is kick ass though.  I came home to toronto for 3 weeks after being away for a year and went to this restaurant twice haha. A must get to start is the fried squash fritters. I know its fried food but its not overly oily and the dish is huge!  I was obsessed with dipping them in the garlic sauce it comes with. nomzzzzz.

For lunch i had the green curry with shrimp - I wasn't crazy about this dish.  It was alot more sauce than anything else and only like 5 shrimp in it.  it was REALLY spicy for me but I honestly can't handle much spice.  I also think it lacked coconut milk.  The dinner dish of curry is better because it comes served in a real coconut :)

For dinner I tried the pad thai.  Second best pad thai in toronto! Then I also tried the green curry with fish (legit only 3 pieces -common trend here) and the braised beef curry.  i LOVED the braised beef curry. There were lots of beef chunks in it and the curry had the perfect amount of kick to it for me.  I would definitely recommend this place and will be back for sure to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"The wait is very long- not only that their food is very sweet... its not bad but its like eating candy sweet, not much of a fan but their tom yum soup is on point def recommend. Unless you like sweet food I dont recommend the second curry with potatoes and the golden curry with fried noodles"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Price is decent.  Maybe the portions for some dishes couldve been bigger but the quality is what counts and it was amazing.  The waitress told me they will be opening one in Vancouver.. Which is where I am from. I am going to go to that for sure. 

Love this place...and I'm going to Thailand in a few months so I'll see how it compares."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places for Thai food - hands down!!! I've traveled all over the world, including 6 cities in Thailand, and this place is an absolute gem! Spectacular service, authentic cuisine, good vibes and a lively atmosphere. 

The pad Thai has a unique flavor and the green curry (served in a young coconut) infuses the right balance of heat and spices. 

Best specialty cocktail is the ____ Ross! If you like Thai iced tea and Kahlua - you'll love this combination!"}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 (would have given a 4 if we didn't get food poisoning) 
My friend and I ordered a Thai iced tea, khao soi, green curry, and mango sticky rice to share.
The green curry was ah-mazing!  I even thought it was slightly better than Khao San Roads', which I always rated as number 1. I could have eaten three bowls of rice with that, so I highly recommend it!
The khao soi with braised beef was good, but I would probably try something else next time. Felt a little ripped off with the mango sticky rice though, wasn't worth 8 bucks.

Service: 3.5/5 
Our waitress and everyone at the restaurant were really nice! However it was just sooooo incredibly slow. I assume they're still getting used to service? Or they were short-staffed, but they really need to work on that.

***Both my friend and I got food poisoning the next morning, which is unfortunate. We're 99.9% sure it was from the restaurant because we both didn't eat before or after dinner.
For the green curry.. we MIGHT give them a second chance, but it'll be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"Love the vibe, love the green coconut curry, love the beef noodle soup. It's all good. Always leave feeling like I couldn't eat another drop."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a flavour that will spark your taste buds, this is the place for you. The best Thai find I've experienced yet. The taste isn't just strong but it's unique. They make their own chilli oil which is so yummy and their Bloody Caesars are crafted with a house made spice rim and Tom Yom. Very spicy! Great environment, fun, loud hip hop/old rap classics for playlist, but service could improve. Server didn't introduce herself and the food took long, but overall, delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly and chill service. The first time I came here I tried the pad gra prow with pork and the chicken wings. The pad gra prow was absolutely delicious. It's so simple, but full of flavour. The chicken wings were pretty good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. My most recent visit I was going to order the pad gra prow again, but with hesitation decided to try the green curry and I was not disappointed. The curry was creamy and sweet with a touch of spicy (ordered mild). It was perfect since green curry is usually so spicy it makes me sick. My husband ordered the pad Thai and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my favourite. Would definitely come back and try the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The vibe, the food, the staff- I love this place. Make a reservation beforehand, it's always packed. The menu for non meat eaters is limited but still yum stuff!"}
{"text":"We were at the Destination Thailand Festival and checked out the food booths. What made Pai stand out was the story board of how the restaurant came to be. We decided to not buy at the stand but check out the restaurant because it was freezing. Also because someone commented that Pai was the best Thai resto  of the 5 booths lined up there. Walked to the resto and didn't expect such a big place. The interior was so fun with the exposed brick and vintage record albums. Not what I would expect a thai resto would look like.

Service was great and asked for recommendations beyond pad thai - tried this shrimp appetizer - very fresh with great flavors! Check it out :)"}
{"text":"Great Thai food and friendly service. Great flavor and freshness in the morning glory vegetable side dish.  The tofu pad thai had tons of fresh veggies in it.  Also had a Northern Thai ground chicken dish that was good.  

I liked that their Thai iced tea wasn't overly sweet. 

Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Love it! The ambience, the food, everything. If you're a Toronto downtown native, you have heard of this place. One must try appetizer are the squash fritters. Most dishes are tasty but my favourite is the fish panang fish curry (fish filets cooked in a panang sauce) as this dish is only available and cooked well in a select few Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Great versions of Thai food. a little pricey- but this is my go-to when I want \"fancy thai\".

Delivery available-starts at 5pm. well packaged although food comes less than hot.

Go ahead and do \"foreigner spicy\" or \"thai spicy\"- medium was nothing for me and i love spice.

Much better than Khao sao road for me. Literally ate these back to back and hands down, KSR is getting sloppy and Pai remains good quality."}
{"text":"Sort of disappointed given the amount of time I had to wait for the food.  Went in with group and heard good things.  The sat us down and handed the at times confusing menu (since it didn't really describe the dish, just the name with what on it.  Maybe nice to have a photo or list of ingredients without having to ask one of the waiters running around?).  Ordered the pad thai and it took our group about 40 minutes to receive the dishes.  The portion size isn't that large (at lunch at least), and it felt sort of dry, even though the flavours felt there."}
{"text":"Delicious Northern Thai Food! We have been there twice. Even loved it more the second time around. Lunch time is very busy and food came fast. I like how you can choose different spice levels for your food. I can eat the pad grow everyday. Thai ice tea is perfect for cooling down the spice! We also love the fun atmosphere and love that the team has for Pai. I will recommend to all my friends and will return soon."}
{"text":"Very flavourful and daily shots are good deals~ always my come back places.. love their coconut curry~!!!"}
{"text":"The food is beyond amazing, the service is pretty meh (though it obviously is a very busy restaurant!). I'll keep coming back for the food."}
{"text":"Certainly does not live up to its hype, although service and decor is nice in the restaurant. The food is alright and the menu seems a little short on selection. Definitely recommend to come here to try out some Thai food (as the wait times aren't as long as Khao San Road), but wouldn't keep coming back to it."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places I have been to so far (in Germany and Canada). Have tried about 40% of their dishes on the menu. Their curries are very creamy and delicious and the pad Thai is great, too. Can't get enough of it that's why I try to go there at least once a week.
This place is always crowded whenever I go there (lunch and dinner) and you may have to wait in line for 10 to 25 min. It may also get very noisy but the food is worth it.

(Note: I have never been in Thailand so I don't know what real Thai food tastes like)"}
{"text":"Gets a bit noisy but the masseman beef and the Khao Soy make it worth it!"}
{"text":"I love pad thai and have had it from different restaurants in the city. But none are as flavourful as at this restaurant. It was like a flavour explosion in my mouth. I can see why this place is so busy. 
The service was pretty good as well and the layout is fun. The high stools where we sat were a bit uncomfortable though."}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed the food. I had red curry and it was delicious. My party had pad thai and she loved that as well. Very friendly and attentive service. The place has loud music and pretty close table seating, so it is not a perfect setup for a romantic dinner, but if you want great good and vibrant atmosphere, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Pai is probably my absolute favourite restaurant in the city. Nuff said. Special shoutouts to the grabong, green curry, khao soi and pad gra prow beef. Honourary mention to the beef massaman."}
{"text":"Yum! I ordered the Khao Soi with braised beef and I was delightfully surprised. The waitress said it was standardized to a \"medium\" spice level so I was pretty skeptical at first, but then she further reassured me that it wasn't too spicy and it turned out great! I'm glad I listened to her because I really enjoyed it! The curry was very creamy and flavorful with a sweet undertone, and the chunks of braised beef were fairly large and tender. The crispy noodle topping also added a great crunchy texture to the overall dish. 

It was a filling and yummy meal! I just felt that the music was too loud because I had to scream to talk over the small table and I could barely even hear myself."}
{"text":"Great food! Very Authentic Thai food. 
I brought my 3friends here to have an eatly dinner but the service we got last Saturday was a bit unpleasant. We came there, walk in no reservation, as there online reservation was not flexible, the only time available was 3pm which we can't make it so we did the walk in. It was quick and  got seated right away. However, the they put us on a very corner. So we asked if we can be moved as we can see that there's more space available and the girl whose serving us said that she can't because if there's 2 people coming they can seat them there, while 4 of us all cramped up on the corner. Then we saw an Ice coffee like drink so we asked if they have If we can have an Ice coffee  and she said \"no we don't serve that it's not in our menu\" not polite. So we pointed out the drink and she said \"Oh it's a milk iced tea\" then my friend asked, which is on the menu \"ok I'll just have the coconut water, please.\" And the server said \"oh! We ran out of it\" so ok fine we went with our orders then after few minutes we saw 4 people coming seating on the table that we asked to be moved. Just right beside our table! Right enough to be right on our face! It was a very bad service I must say, I understand if it was really busy with really no spot available but there is a spot, we wouldn't have asked if its not possible. And for that I give 2 star. I would give 4 but but the customer service was foul. Service is important to me. customer's last impression to a restaurant and how restaurants make their customers feel after leaving their place is important. Aside from the taste of food a good customer service would also do the magic. Would i eat here again? maybe because the food is great, but I will second thought of bringing my family or friends just because of the bad service, and by the way this is my 2nd time eating here and service is almost the same but even worst this time."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 10 people. They charged me a 20% GRATUITY....but their service was God-awful. They rarely attended our table, It took 55 minutes for our food to arrive. They took our drink orders and did not deliver them. And at the end, they put all of the wrong items on all of our receipts and over charged us.... not impressed. The food was decent but the over experience was awful. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time at Pai dining with company who have been here before and wow, was it amazing?!  Very cute establishment with lovely ambiance.  We were starving so I think it didn't help that the maybe 25 mins. wait for food felt like eternity...but once served, it was so worth the wait.  Had the deep fried basa fillets served with a side of rice and two sauces...utterly delicious!  So flavourful, lightly fried and well complimented by the rice...and I barely even eat rice!  Sampled my company's foods and the curry and soup dishes were so rich.  Haven't had authentic Thai for quite so time and am used to the standard dishes but Pai really raised the bar.  Great portions and pricing, well done!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, not only is the atmosphere great but the staff is also top notch. This is some of the best Thai I have ever had. They also have 1 liter Sapporo which is just a bonus. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this find, the setting is underground hip. Tom yum Casaer, ginger mule and tasty noodles. I ran out of noodles but I packed that broth to go. Eating it later with my leftover rice from an Indian restaurant last night."}
{"text":"I love this place! I came here with a few friends, and we ordered the spring rolls and 4 main dishes. Everything on the menu looks amazing, and we had such a hard time deciding what to get. In the end, we managed to narrow down our choices, and everything that came was absolutely delicious! My favorites were the Spring Rolls and Pad Thai. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan gets bonus points for presentation, as it came in a cute little coconut. I can't wait to come back and try the other dishes! As I watched the waiters/waitresses pass by with other tables' orders, everything looked so good!

I would recommend making reservations or coming early, as the place gets packed quickly and the lines get long. I came on a Saturday night with a group of 5. We arrived just before 6pm, and were seated right away. About 5 mins after we sat down, I saw a line start to form at the entrance.

I loved the the street-vibe feel of the place, and thought it was a great place to hang out and catch up with friends. However, the place does get pretty crowded, and the tables are mostly pretty close together, so it can get a bit loud."}
{"text":"mediocre, if not hungry might give
One star. Price is on the higher side for the amount.music is too loud."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in Canada at reasonable prices. Clearly their mortal and pestle gets heavy usage. The flavours are so vibrant and separate theme from other Thai restaurants. The service both times I've visited was a bit unpleasant and bossy though"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend the squash fritter as an appetizer! Pai is definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the city and the atmosphere is very unique :) great music and funky decor"}
{"text":"I finally returned to this place after a one year hiatus - I've never had enough time to wait. On a Friday night, I waited 1.5 hours for a table for 2. Luckily, I live around the corner so I went home to get ready while waiting. 

The atmosphere and food was better than I remembered it - it's clearly gained more popularity. I was craving some Pad See Ew, but they don't that so I opted for the Pad Thai (unoriginal I know). I forgot their spicy scale is so different from Khao San's so I went for the \"foreigner's spicy\" - one level below Thai spicy and...IT WASN'T SPICY AT ALL. Either that, or they forgot to put any spiciness in my dish. 

That was a bummer, but everything else was great. It's pretty loud so I felt like I lost half my voice after my dinner. That was probably also because it took almost an hour for our food to arrive (they must have been extra busy that night)."}
{"text":"Just ate here a couple of days ago, and it is my new favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto...  Having tried all of chef Nuit's restos, I would rank them such:  1) Pai; 2) Khao San Road; 3) Sabai Sabai and Sukho tied... This is based on a combination of factors, including taste, decor, ambiance, location, and value for money.  I can only imagine how Pai will distance itself from the rest once their liquor licence is in place!  

No, this and KSR are not for dates (too noisy), and you will have to avoid the swarm of suits decending from the business district, but the cool, kitschy decor and delicious menu make up for it, AND they have a patio!  Some favourites from KSR are on the new menu here, but clay pot dishes like the Gaeng Hung Lay, with its rich, thick gravy blanketing either pork belly or oxtail were amazing!  The salad app was beautifully plated, as was a curry that I saw presented inside a coconut at the table next to us...

I am deducting one star only because, despite the plethora of beer signs and an entire page of alcohol in the menu, they didn't have their liquor licence in order yet, and we couldn't have a cold beer with this delicious Thai food!  However, their juices were a delicious option!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Had oxtails that were cooked great. They were very tasty and would probably order them again. Had saki bombs which were surprisingly good. The saki was good but the beer they paired it with was even better. The prices were normal so it wasn't bad at all;I would definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Visiting Canada as a tourist and getting awesome food feels awesome.
Amazing Thai cuisine. Loved the ambience. Very busy place but was worth waiting for 20-25 mins for the delicious food. 
Veg and tofu Thai curry - served in coconut. Very rich taste of the curry. Lots of veggies and tofu.
Khao soi - Had this first time and it was sooooo delicious. Chicken was so tendered and the curry was very very tasty. 
Mango sticky rice - OMG! Haven't had better mangoes then this place. 
I hope they open in Philadelphia!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, after I visited Thailand I thought I would never be able to taste the same quality of pad thai and curries again.  Well, Pai comes pretty close to the same quality of food that I had in Thailand.  The portions are quite large, service is fast, and the atmosphere in the restaurants reminds me of a small restaurant on Khao San Road in Bangkok.  I recommend getting there early for dinner service on Fridays, as it was pretty packed at 5:00pm.  Reservations were almost impossible to come by.  The price is a little more on the higher end, but the portions are large enough.  Definitely a go to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for dinner, place was packed. Ordered the braised ribs curry and pad Thai which was absolutely delicious. Prices are reasonable as well, would definitely recommend if you were looking for Thai food downtown."}
{"text":"The green curry from this restaurant is fantastic. I have only ever had take out but I trust it is amazing. every time we try to go here it is at least a 1 hour wait time so we give up:) but take out is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I've never had such horrible food ever in my life. Thanks for nothing. Jk I lied"}
{"text":"I've been to Pai countless times now. I've tried most of their menu and my favourite item is their pad Thai.

I usually get the Thai Spicy which makes me teary but it's so worth it. Taste wise , this is the best Thai food I have had . The only down side is that the servings don't fill me up ( I tend to eat more than average folks).

For me this place is tied with Sukhothai. Pai has slightly better food by Sukhothai has more quantity. Both places are 5 out of 5 ... and are owned the the same people I believe."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic, delicious, real Thai! Everything is wonderful- can't go wrong. Be prepared for a bustling energetic friendly environment. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I love Pai! It's my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The food is consistently delicious and authentic to the flavours of Thailand (I've spent a month there). Their typical Thai dishes like Pad Thai and green curry are really great. It's my favourite pad Thai in the city. Another thing I've never seen on any other menus is their Miang Kung which comes as a make your own mini wraps with betel leaves, cooked shrimp and a variety of finely diced aromatics like ginger and scallion as well as lime and pomelo for some tartness. Add a little bit of the tamarind sauce and peanuts and you've got yourself a flavour bomb. 

Another dish they do really well is their Khao Soi. The portion is very generous and the yellow curry sauce is very rich. Highly recommend! For apps, I love their Moo Ping pork skewers, they're sticky, charred and full of fatty deliciousness. You can cut the rich flavours with a refreshing Thai iced tea that's made with sweetened condensed milk. Honestly, all their food is so good here! 

The vibe is very fun here too, very busy, a bit loud and decorated with fun bits and bobs that give a throwback to the town of Pai which is where the owner originally opened her first curry house. Make reservations 48 hours in advance or expect to way when you get there. I recommend going early for best availability."}
{"text":"Food is good spicy, ambience is cool. Service a bit slow but friendly. You better plan in advance or face a big line up."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I'm a huge fan of Thai food and I can always appreciate bold and deeply flavourful food creations.

After being highly recommended to us, 6 of us decided to go in at about 2pm on a Tuesday, it was busy when we arrived but not busy enough where we had to wait for a table. 

----The Details & Food----

The atmosphere was very neat and inviting, nicely laced with A/C. Our waitress Nicole was very attentive and knowledgable about the menu, which is always appreciated. 

We started with drinks: 

Thai Ice Tea & Lemongrass Ice Tea:
Both were SO freaking delicious!! It's hard to choose a favourite. I guess I can separate their greatness by saying the lemon grass one is so refreshing and it's a must if you feel parched or hot, and the Thai Ice Tea is very sweet and flavourful but almost heavy in comparison. Both very different, but So so good. 

I ordered the wings as an appy then ordered the Green Curry with Chicken as my main.
All the food was so incredible and the depth of flavour was unbelievable!! My dish had bamboo shoots in it and I generally don't enjoy them but I absolutely loved the way they prepared them and included in the dish. I loved the coconut milk green curry sauce.. I love it so much I dreamt about bathing in it haha. Kidding .. not .. maybe lol. 
It was just beyond incredible.

The location, ambiance, service, drinks and food, I really loved all of it. Everyone agreed, too. Next time I'm in Toronto I will certainly be paying a visit!! 

M.M."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Toronto, hands down and awesome atmosphere. Toronto needs more restaurants like this."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the place was very well decorated, the service was good. The only thing we can complain about that was the menu. It was hard to read with some thai food name and long descriptions. If they add pictures to their menu then it would be easier to find the favarite food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and found it packed! The waiter was surprised we were from out of town so I assume it is a well-known popular local place. Small menu for lunch but the waiter had good recommendations. We tried the wings as an appetizer and I had the Crispy pork holy basil. My colleague had the green curry which she raved about. I ordered the crispy pork farang or foreigner spicy, one step below Thai spicy which had a bite to it. 

While we waited for our food prior we were complimenting Pai about its decor of old albums from the 80s and underground rock feel. I even saw a back room I assume designated for private parties. 

Would recommend to anyone! Definitely would return"}
{"text":"This place was hopping - and very LOUD (my only complaint). The place really was jamming at 6:30 PM when I arrived. I was greeted promptly and seated right away at the bar. The service was prompt and friendly, the food was delicious and reasonably priced. I will definitely eat here again next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Pai is so cool and puts out such tasty food that it makes you never want to go back to your ho-hum neighborhood Thai place, unless it's out of loyalty with a dash of pity. My barometer for Thai food is always pad thai; if it's good, I want to return. Their pad thai is generously-portioned, veg-friendly and has a sauce that is deeply flavourful. On top of that, there's such a lively ambiance at Pai that smacks of dynamism, which is what we want more of in our lives, right?"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here multiple times. We keep coming back for the Pad Thai, the Squash Fritters and the Thai Iced Tea! It is the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Hands down. In the words of John Catucci \"You gotta eat here!\""}
{"text":"I love pad thai and the first time I came to Pai I greatly enjoyed it, but the past 2 times I've been here the service has been really slow, and when I requested no coriander on the dishes they ignored my request."}
{"text":"The decorations in this place are out of this world, very authentic relative to the feeling I got in Thailand while backpacking. The Pad Thai is to die for, get a mango juice with it too, awesome combination. Watch out for the spiciness, this is Thai spice we are talking about here, so that medium might be suicide for those inexperienced taste buds. Make sure to get a reservation on weekends, or take the chance of an hour long wait."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best thai restaurants I have been to in Toronto. Their curry and pad thai are extremely flavourful and authentic. Coupled with their friendly staff, it makes the experience all the better. I personally have not seen noodles tied in a knot to be served in a dish before and thought that it was very pleasing to look at and eat! 

The reason why this place would lose a star is because i waited for almost 2hrs for a table for 5. To be fair, that is a relatively large group, but 2hrs does seem a little bit too long of a wait. 

I would definitely come back here in a smaller group or make reservations beforehand. Overall, the food, atmosphere and service was great."}
{"text":"Great food though wait times can get pretty long. Been here a few times and also ordered take out. Can't go wrong if you are looking for awesome Thai food."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best thai restaurants, if not THE BEST, I've had in Toronto. 

Each time, the chicken Pad Thai is my go-to and it has never failed me. Even order on Uber Eats, it's so delicious and I'm pretty sure they packed more in the container! Honestly the best pad thai I've ever had. If you know one better, by all means let me know and I challenge you to try this one. Seriously, you'd think plain pad thai can't be amazing but this one would prove you wrong.

The green-curry is really nice, but if you don't get it spicy, it can be a bit bland. Loved the flavours, loved everything about it. 

Both these dishes are very tasty and very filling. You do feel satisfied afterwards and rightfully so.

The Khao So wasn't especially great, I won't lie. The flavour was too strong and was a little oily. Maybe it's just not my taste. 

Hard to get a table sometimes after work, but the fact that they deliver on Uber Eats or you can order to go is great."}
{"text":"I got the Beef pad thai and lemongrass drink. Really like the lemongrass drink, very refreshing in the summer."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday around 3 for a late lunch. We were seated right away since we were a party of two. Service was normal at the beginning, but after we received our meals we never saw our server again. Not sure if he was off duty and whoever took over our table forgot about us or what. Safe to say I was disappointed with the service. Waited for 35 minutes after we were finished eating and we had to ask someone who was cleaning empty tables nearby to take our plates and bring our bill since no one acknowledged us. It was busy but not too busy where we would have been forgotten about. Thank goodness the food was tasty. We ordered the khao soi and the green curry"}
{"text":"Surprised I haven't written a review about Kai before today. This restaurant is one of my favourites. I feel transported back to Thailand every time I step in here. For some reason, I always thought they don't take reservations, so I've always been stuck in a long wait, but I saw last time that they do in fact have reservations on their website. 

My favourites are the Tom Yum Soup, Pad Thai, Moo Ping ( I could just eat 3 orders of these alone), Coconut Shrimp, Khao Soi, and Panang Curry - okay maybe I like the whole menu. 

They also have fun drinks like Thai Buckets, but don't be mistaken these aren't the authentic ones that give you wings! Haha."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The energy and ambiance was incredible. The art and album covers in the walls combined with the story of the origin of the establishment made the place feel more like a welcoming home than an actual restaurant. Which was great."}
{"text":"Went to Pai!

It was bustling, busy. Super fun!

We ordered:
Pad Thai!!!!!

Servie: I could tell its new restaurant and things are being worked out, but Service was super courteous, sweet and warm. 

Overal: recommend, great addition to neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Always great, always busy, always tasty. One of the top relaxed Thai experiences in the city."}
{"text":"I've lived downtown for nearly 16 years, and witnessed many cool restaurants fall by the wayside, only to be renovated into a Milestones or Hooters. I'm so happy that Pai, the new kid in town, is garnering some good business!

This place has it all!  A great atmosphere, reasonable prices, delicious food (that doesn't shy away from genuine thai flavours and spices), and friendly, helpful staff.

I return here often, and recommend this place all the time!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food, but this restaurant exceeded my usual Thai expectations. My family visited from Chicago and I wanted to take them to some place special. And they wanted Thai, it was on a Monday and it's already packed! It says something about the establishment, that this restaurant could be really good  xoxo The server was really nice and polite! The food was excellent! We had an amazing experience, proud Toronto foodie here! I'm so happy that my family had a really great time. That's what important! Thanks PAI Northern Thai Kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great Thai food and I believe the people who opened this place came from Khao San Road (another great thai place nearby) - so it's obviously really good. Great vibes and energy and good ambience. Pretty decor and food is very well presented."}
{"text":"Cool place for thai food. Used to love their pad thai but felt their food quality was getting lower so I rarely go there now."}
{"text":"i love pai. i pai almost every other week. never sick of the restaurant. the chicken pad thai is amazing. the chicken wings are amazing. the \"morning glory\" is amazing. the thai milk tea is amazing. basically, those are what i order every time i go. i looooooove pai."}
{"text":"Not as good as the hype!

I was excited to try Pai after my experience at Khao San Road. However, we might have ordered the wrong dishes because I was not that impressed.

I highly recommend reservations. We went on a weekday for dinner and there was still a 20-30 min wait.

We sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice and offered recommendations. I noticed that he was probably new as he had two glasses as \"examples\" for how much liquid he should pour for the drinks (see pictures).

I got a Thai Iced Tea ($4.50). I would not recommend it - I felt like I had diabetes from drinking it. Also, it was not filled up to the top. I think he needs an example of the Thai iced tea drink to follow too!

The bartender suggested we try the Pad Gra Prow, beef with crispy pork. It did not live up to expectations. It was okay, I guess, but not great. For $15, it was a good enough portion for one person, but a bit expensive for some beef and pork on top of rice.

We also got the green curry, gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut, $15. We got mild spicy and it was more like a medium spicy, I think. Also, it needed more rice. There was so much curry that we were basically drinking a curry soup that had rice at the bottom. It came with a lot of stuff inside too: basil, shrimp, and bamboo shoots. There was so much that they had to put some shrimp in a separate bowl (according to the bartender). I liked this dish - very delicious - they scrape the inside of the coconut and put it in the curry too. I just think they should give more rice!!!

I think I would come back but not get the Thai iced tea and I would order what I know will be good. The Khao Soi, for example. I really regret the Thai Iced Tea. And next time I'll make reservations."}
{"text":"This place was super busy when we arrived. We didn't reserve beforehand and luckily for a table for 2 the wait was only about 25 minutes. 
The music is loud here and it has dimmed lighting, kind of give off a bar atmosphere. 

We ordered the squash fritters, green curry with beef (medium spice), and khao soi with chicken breast.
The squash fritters was very good. You can taste the squash since it's not over battered and is fried nicely. The dip that comes with the fritters gives it a sweet and spicy flavour and the large portion size is perfect for sharing. 

The green curry with beef came in a coconut filled with lots of veggies and beef. Then extra curry came on the side. The curry comes with rice and I would have to say this dish was just ok. It was creamy and had enough spice but it lacked flavour. 

The dish that stood out the most was the khao soi with chicken breast. It was very creamy and the combination of spicy, sweet, and savoury totally gave a umami taste to this dish. The noodles are great and the khao soi came with garnishes on the side which it didn't really need because it was already very good on its own. However I would have to say chicken breast is not the best choice for this because the chicken came out to be kind of dry. 

I would come back for their takeout service since it is quite busy and also the loud music makes it hard to converse with my party."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. No competition. So many amazing flavors and well developed dishes. A must try if you're in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Really good thai place in the downtown area! I loved the coconut curry chicken and it's such a unique dish! I feel like this is something I can only find a this restaurant and makes the trip worthwhile. I also like the island vibe décor - really feels like you're on vacation :) Prices might be a tad high for thai food, but honestly, for the downtown area, it is quite reasonable. Overall, this is definitely a place I would recommend to friends and family! Only downside is that this place can get quite loud and may be hard to hear conversations at the same table."}
{"text":"Oh lord, so so so good, the pad gra ma, with beef or pork, who knew something could be that tasty, so amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so let me start by saying I've been a loyal customer at Pai for over a year now. I pick up lunch from here at least once every two weeks. I always get the green curry because it is literally perfection! The vegetables, chicken, spice, every element of this dish is amazing. 

BUT they changed the recipe!!  The last two times I picked up lunch from Pai the green curry was missing the fig-looking and pea-looking vegetables! I am so devastated and disappointed because the price didn't change but the quality did. It really is a shame."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday night with my girlfriends for a Galentine's Day/a friend's belated birthday celebration dinner; and it was wonderful! Loved the restaurant ambience. It was busy, but not too loud. It's edgy and eclectic in both their interior design and music - loved the playlist of throwbacks yesterday, so great. The food was delicious and the server was friendly. The Khao Soi, Pad Thai and Grapong were delicious. We also had the sake bomb shots which were quite good ;) Hahaha."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, got drinks and dinner and was very happy with the food here, chicken satay is a must eat"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and they are always busy. If you are in the area, this is the best choice. 

Every dish I have tried has been awesome. You really can't go wrong. If you are into Thai food, this is a must visit place. 

Try the thai iced tea. There is nothing quite like it."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've given a 5 star rating to a place. The service was wonderful, she kept checking back on us if we were doing good. The food was excellent!!! I think I stuffed myself too much and I was full for days. 

God for the curry and the pad thai! It comes in a coconut!!!

The place doesn't seem that big from the outside, but once you enter the place, they have two separated rooms. One massive room for parties! I love the decor, I love the atmosphere. Although it's a little bit tight in there, the couple next to us was clearly not pleased they have to sit pretty close to us. She wanted to move to a \"quieter\" place but the place was pretty packed so they couldn't move, and the girl was pissed. But seriously? 

Overall, I love this place, I didn't noticed it while I was there but the music was pretty loud, I was wondering why I was running out of breath while I'm literally screaming across the table. 

I will def. come back for more!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:

The vast majority of items on the menu here can be made gluten-free and my go-to ones are the Chef Nuit Pad Thai or the Gaeng Masaman. Both are super delicious. Make sure you specify you need your item to be gluten-free though because most aren't normally gluten free. I also recommend getting the thai iced tea if you like the taste of roasted tea.

As for cross contamination, I am not sure how everything is prepared in the kitchen as I didn't ask. I have a moderate intolerance and do not have celiac's disease, however in the numerous times I've been here I've never had a reaction to the food. 

TL;DR most options can be made gluten-free; thai iced tea is yum"}
{"text":"This place is so highly rated, our expectations were not met. We have our local favorite Thai places, and what we ate here was good, but not tremendous. The atmosphere is loud, so anyone planning to eat here needs to know that."}
{"text":"I've been to all of Regular's restaurants in Toronto, and this is by far my favourite. I always order either their pad thai and grilled pork with sticky rice on the side. Atmosphere is nice and I enjoy its decor. That took me long enough to write a review! I've already been here at least 3 times this year alone and it's only April!

I remember the first time I went last year. I heard a tweet as my friend poured water, and we thought we were hearing things. Eventually we figured out it's the bottle! How cute and amusing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"LOVE he coconut flavour of the khao soi. Kinda sad they weren't able to increase the heat on this but still delicious!"}
{"text":"It is the BEST Thai restaurant that I have tried in months.... I was shocked! Normally people doesn't suggest me any good restaurant... but this was incredible!

Waiting:
You have to wait between 45 to 50 minutes but believe me... it worth it! Make a reservation if you don't like to wait. They have a pretty cool system to do that. 

Food:
The Spring Rolls are amazing!! The Gaeng Kiaw Wan, or like I called it: The Coconut Curry is magical... it comes with perfect jasmine rice.

Staff:
They are GREAT!

I've been there twice, and I really want to go back right now!

Try it... You'll not regreat it"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday. The wait time was not bad, but as we were leaving there were many groups waiting at the entrance. 

Service is quick and friendly. Servers are always refilling your glass with water, especially needed if you're having lots of spicyness!

We ordered a shared app of the grabong (deep fried squash). A good sharing size portion for 2-3 people. The garlic tamarind dip that comes with it is also very tasty! My fiance ordered the green curry and that came in a coconut (very cute idea). What i liked was that his curry was overflowing and all the chicken was not inside the coconut, so they served some more curry and chicken on a side dish on the side! The portion of this is quite fair and the taste is quite tasty.

I ordered the khao soi with chicken breast and the curry is sooo flavourful. It comes with noodles inside but definitely not enough. I saved the rest of my curry and brought it home to have with rice the next day. Definitely generous with the chicken breast though. 

Though the reason why I am not giving this place a 5 star is because of the price. Any thai restaurant in downtown seem to be a little high in price. Our meal came up to almost 50$ and we didn't even order alcohol! I guess being an asian, I always expect asian food to be slightly cheaper in price. But definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"I would like to say I'm bit of a Pad Thai snob. Chef nuit pad thai is really good. I've had both the chicken and shrimp versions. I subtracted one star because \"mild\" is definitely NOT mild. It's more like medium to hot. Pai needs to work on their spice scale."}
{"text":"Best pad thai in Toronto! Really good Thai iced tea. We always come back for the khao soi. Excellent prices, same portion sizes for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I am always a fan of Northern Thai cuisines, and was very happy to scout one in Toronto during my visit.

Although the restaurant could seat 200-300 (my guestimate), it was already fairly crowded at 5pm when we entered. We were seated right away in a large table sharing with two other parties, but all the parties were far away enough to allow relatively private conversations

We ordered green curry and the Northern Thai traditional coconut curry noodle soup (khao soi gai) - both were yummy, authentic, and above all, very fairly prices :)"}
{"text":"I took my parents here for a lunch on my Mother's birthday. It was fairly busy, since it was a Saturday, but we were seated promptly. 

Both the service and food was definitely better than our expectations, which have been lowered since there are so many mediocre Thai places popping up around Downtown Toronto. 

My parents, vegetarians who have small appetites and conventional palate, ordered the Vegetarian Pad Thai, while I had the Crispy Basa Fillet with jasmine rice and Thai iced-tea. We were all very pleased with the food and enjoyed it fully, even my father who tends to not like Pad Thai easily.

The pad Thai was well seasoned and the flavours were balanced, creating a cohesive sweet, tangy, and nutty flavour that was delicious. The fish was beyond fluffy, with a perfectly crispy and seasoned batter, it was cooked to the exactly right temperature, for it to remain moist while still staying light despite the fact that is was deep fried. The Thai iced-tea was also delicious, and much closer to what I'm told is how it was originally served in Thailand (despite still have artificial colouring in it). It wasn't overly sweet like some places, and has a distinct almost nutty tea flavour that I could not get enough of. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this place. While it's not the most authentic (it does after all cater to the typical western tastes) it is now fairly high in my top 10 Thai places to go to in Toronto."}
{"text":"I think I've had every dish on this menu and everything is absolutely delicious! Fresh and flavourful. Ambience is fun and lively with good music. Absolute crave worthy!"}
{"text":"Amazing khao soi braised beef. Beef was so tender and amazing and it went so well with the noodles. It was amazing. And let me tell you, medium spice was perfect. It added enough kick. It was also very creamy and overall a great meal. 

My boyfriend ordered the green curry in coconut and that was bomb as well. The curry was the right kind of flavor and the coconut was fresh and added something a little sweet to the taste - which was refreshly delicious.

Service was great because we reserved prior. If you don't reserve, be prepared to wait because the line IP is always long on the weekends. The servers were quick to their feet and the friendly. The overall atmosphere was great -always packed but intimate enough to have a conversation in the dim lights. 

Definitely coming here again to try out more food. The mango with sticky rice was something that I really wanted to try but I was too full. The food is great, very filling and amazing for the price."}
{"text":"Pai is a great Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto serving up authentic Northern Thai food.  We are great fans of the owners, and chef Nuit Regular really knows how to make addictive dishes.  Our favorite dishes are the: Pad Thai with shrimp, and Gaeng Kiaw Wan with chicken, served in a coconut husk.  The Gaeng Massaman is also a winner.  Try everything at least once, and you can then decide on your favorites.  The atmosphere at Pai is also nice and energetic.  It's a great place to go with friends and family, or for a casual or first date."}
{"text":"An excellent addition to this saturation of mediocre restaurants close of king street. A perfect pre or post theatre dinner or drinks. 

Love how it feels like I've walked into a tropical island and left the city. 

Right now their menu still seems to  be finalized. There were items that weren't on the menu like the ox tail curry and pork belly everything.  I found the portions small at first but it was a good size in the end for two people. 

We had the ox tail curry which was excellent and the fried fish with tamarind sauce. It was delicately fried and not greasy. 

For dessert the mango sticky rice was really good and recommended. 

They have a nice mat kneeling area good for     
A good size group. Also a small nook to the left and a private party room begin the bar ? 
Lots of options for drinks and fun. No liquor license yet!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait long. Loved the coconut sake and the recommendation from our waitress. So yum! If I'm Toronto, eat here!"}
{"text":"Another place in toronto that has been taken over by the hype. Don't get me wrong food tastes very traditional, they definitely didn't dumb it down for Canadians, but with hype comes over zealous reviews so heres an honest one for you. Got the curry in that cool bowl they make out of a coconut it wasn't bad, actually kind of good. They earned their points with me in their service. Place is always super busy, due to hype, but they don't forget about the little tables tucked in the corners. People here are friendly. If you like Thai food you should check it out.  Balanced menu everything that my group got was delicious so you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! I would  recommend the cojo cocktails and pad Thai green curry and satay skewers were also delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here to check out the hype from social media.

The restaurant was surprisingly not jam-packed and we came around thirty minutes after 12 on a Saturday.  We were seated at the stools instead of the traditional seating at the back as that table could only seat up to 4 people (we had 6 people). 

I ordered the Pad Grow with crispy pork, as its one of their featured dish. Tasted similar to the Taiwanese minced pork rice. The difference is the egg is not boiled but pan fried. Since I got the mild version, the flavour was okay. It wasn't bland but it lacked a bit of flavour too. Will try the spicier version next time."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Toronto.... Their Massaman Beef is a dream.  Totally worth the wait - just grab a cocktail and watch the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"We went on Wednesday 7pm on a very hot weather (32 degrees). It was 20 minutes wait for inside and no wait for patio, and as we were so hungry, we took the patio. Luckily it was under shade so i didn't die. 
Tried green curry in coconut with chicken ($16, 3.5/5), and the red curry with beef and rice ($14, 5/5).  Loved them both, especially the red one. 
The price is on the higher side, and place couldve been cleaner..  but I am craving them ever since! 
But from my experience, pad thai wasn't as great. So I will go back for the curry."}
{"text":"This place is very good. Got the spiciest Pad Thai, had a solid burn for those who like spice. Otherwise I'd recommend the mild Pad Thai. This place seems to be permanently packed with a 30 to 45 minute wait. We got lucky and sat at the bar immediately, but definitely make a reservation ahead of time or be ok with s long wait. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"Pai is a difficult restaurant for me to review because the food was hyped up quite a bit prior to my dining experience and my expectations were set higher than normal. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and I would return back. 

Food: 4 stars - lots of variety, sharing/snack dishes,  good portions, my Khao Soi was very rich and a little too far on the sweet side
Atmosphere: 4.5 stars - very casual/fun, trinkets and odds and ends throughout the restaurant, 
booked well in advance or be prepared to wait for a table
Service: 5 stars - prompt, professional, knowledgable, engaging"}
{"text":"We first visited Pai when we couldn't get a table at Khao San Road. Now that Khao San Road is closed/moving, Pai is our new financial district go-to for good thai!

What you should eat:
- Get the Pad Gra Prow. Do it, and you will NOT be disappointed. The star of the dish is the meat: highly flavourful, and has a higher kick of spice than other dishes at Pai. If you're a spice amateur do not be brave and get a medium. Stick with mild.
- So happy Grabong was brought in at Pai (was a fave of ours at Khao San). It's a simple fried appetizer and a crowd pleaser.
- Recently Pai also brought in mango with sweet rice and coconut sauce: a classic fave of mine, which is hard to find done well. Pai's version was fresh and tasty.

Be careful:
- Pai fills up really quickly and tends to be busy. Thankfully, they take reservations, but those fill up as well. Book early, or expect a wait in line!"}
{"text":"Okay so I was wrong about this place.

As a huge khao San road fan, I was disappointed over the khao soi I had here a year ago. Since then I have always refused to eat here. In my opinion the khao soi has a too strong coconut flavour.

Today however I got the beef curry and loved it so much! I got it foreign spicy and it was really spicy ! I drank 5 glasses of water to help with the spice levels, but adored the flavours in the curry.

My friends got the pad gra prow, and the beef noodle soup and also enjoyed their meals. For extremely picky eaters, this should say something."}
{"text":"Never coming back again! Here' why:
1. extremely slow service - took over 15mins for our drinks to arrive, another 20 mins later 1 extremely small appetizer dish arrived and then another 25-30 mins later the food arrived. That's over an hr of waiting before the main course
2. bad drinks - their Cesar tastes bitter! I couldn't drink more than half of it
3. After all the wait and bad drinks, the food was OK but a but overpriced! 2 drinks, 1 tiny app and 2 dinner dishes aren't worth $70+ tip if theres bad service, bad drinks and avg tasting food. Even the restaurant isn't all that great! They cheaped out on the ambiance, very uncomfortable chairs esp when we have to wait an hr for food; could have at least hired more cooks/servers!"}
{"text":"Went to try this place after reading rave reviews but found it to be a bit disappointing. Khao san road definitely wins in terns of flavour, authenticity, and quality. Had the green coconut curry, khao soi with beef, and grabong (squash fritters). That being said, it was still a decent meal and the khao soi had plenty of beef. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some chicken Pad Thai and a Singha.
Food was very good and the beer cold.
The medium spice was perfect for me.
Very loud room so don't come for quiet conversation."}
{"text":"Have been here couple times. Service and food here never disappoint me. This is the place to get some authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Ambiance: would be the best hang out choice to start up the morning or end the evening... 

Service: very fast and consistent

Price: lower average price

Food: close to authentic thai. Tasty! 

Others: not sure if it's because it's like underground, but my nose is super sensitive... I can smell the sewage after sitting there for 20mins... And that somehow turned off my appetite... Even with all the flavours and spice, the sewage was still bothering me and not my buddies... I won't for sure be eating there after smelling the sewage"}
{"text":"The best Thai I have EVeR had, and I live near New York City and have had good thai food. The dishes had excellent presentation and tasted like they  were made with love. Even the Thai iced tea had crunchy shaved ice and surprisingly made it more enjoyable. There were little details in the food presentation that made it taste gourmet. Loved the pad Thai and the dish with the crispy noodles. Yum. I wish I could go again right now."}
{"text":"After trying to go on a Saturday night at 6:30PM, we soon realized how busy this place gets! Lesson learned.. So we returned for an anniversary on a Saturday at 5:30PM and was kindly greeted by the staff to a table without wait. 

The ambiance was very nice and added to the Thai experience! Everything from the dining room to even the restroom (I cannot believe I am commenting on this) decor added to the night. You can tell they put a great level of care into this place. 

The food was superb! One of the best Thai places I have gone to and on the same level as the other place down the street. We started with Sai Ua Platter (Northern Thai Sausage) and to my surprise, it only included one sausage! I was a little concerned, but the flavour was so on point that it was well worth the money. The pad gra prow was very savory and my most recommended item on the menu. The only complaint, which is a little one, was that the Tom Yum soup (which was deliciously sour and hot) ladle is not ideal for scooping soup. If the ladle was a tad smaller, it would have been perfect!!"}
{"text":"I have always ordered the beef Pad gra prow and loved it for the freshness of the ingredients. It's always a big dish and you are never hungry afterwards. And the sliced cucumbers are so fresh and delicious. I also enjoy their spring rolls as once again, the ingredients are fresh and the skin is crispy.  The Chef is female and she use to be at Kao San Road, which I found has gone downhill. If you want to be sure to get a seat without a reservation, arrive by 5:30 pm and you will get one either at a table or at the bar."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic.  But service is hit or miss.
The first time I went the server was a very nice South Asian fellow.  He was pleasant and catering to our needs.  The second time I went the server was short, South Asian woman with hair down to her chin level.  The interaction with her was absolutely brutal.  No smiling.  No acknowledgement of requests.  I seriously don't care for bad service like this.  The food is great but as I said, service can be quite hit or miss."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends - food is good but the service is just really slow. they have this system where you can ONLY be served by the person attending your table, so if you ever hail down one of the other waiters they'll just tell you they're going to get your table's waiter, then disappear and nobody shows up. they also didn't give us all of our items and we had to ask for it again. i hate to complain about service because i know it's a tough industry but they need to hire more people and the current servers just need to be faster.

the food was great - id recommend everything but the mango sticky rice, maybe its just how they serve it traditionally but the rice was really hard and hot, and the mango was half warm from the rice and it was not worth $8 at all."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the city. Hasnt missed once. My only complaint is that its too hard to get a table at lunch time. But its worth it when you do. 
The green curry is outstanding."}
{"text":"Pai is very good. It is brought to you by the people that brought you Sabai Sabai (which is one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto). I would recommend going with a few friends. The menu at Pai is best enjoyed family style. 

The Chef Nuit Pad Thai is a signature dish and is delicious. It taste homemade. On this occasion, I paired it with a Thai milk tea which I would recommend.

The price is slightly higher than other Thai places but it is fair for the quality you are getting."}
{"text":"3.5

Pai is hands down my favourite Thai restaurant, and still is. But last night, we were given plates with bits of rice stuck on the top and bottom. So we had to change our plates - hence half star is taken off. 

I had the khao soi with chicken and I think it would've been better if I had it with beef. We waited almost 30 mins for our food to arrive. It was incrediblely busy and I definitely recommend making a reservation! Thai ice tea is also a must when you come here."}
{"text":"First Sukho Thai spawned Koh San Road and now Chef Nuit left Koh San Road to open Pai, Toronto's latest delicious Thai restaurant. 

Having had a blast in the small town of Pai when I lived in Thailand I had great memories come back as we headed down to check out this new restaurant. 

It was a good thing we made a reservation, something that I don't think you can do at Sukho Thai or Koh San Road, as Pai was packed with a 90 minute wait at the door. 

Of the three restaurants listed above Pai has the nicest decor and the seating is more spaced out which is a nice change. 

The food, as advertised was delicious. I feel like Pai's prices are the same or a little more than at Koh San Road and definitely more than at Sukho Thai. The one difference is that you probably get more food at the other locations.

The squash fritters were delicious and similar to what you get at Koh San Road. The difference was that they were served with an especially amazing sauce at Pai. 

The Northern Thai sweet grilled pork on a skewer was also tasty.

The Pad Thai had a nice tang to it. 

The Massaman Braised Beef had a lovely flavour and the meat flaked apart easily. 

We ordered the Khao Pad Saparot with chicken which came served in half a pineapple which was a nice touch. 

We finished up with the one item on the dessert menu - mango sticky rice. This is an absolute staple in Thailand and I don't believe I have seen it on a menu in Toronto before. Other than that fresh mangoes come right off the tree in Thailand with a special flavour, this dish was very close to what you get in Thailand. I had not tasted this combination of flavours in years. 

We struck out and ordered mostly new dishes I had not tried before. Pai has many of my favourites, like green curry and Khao Soi, but I have yet to try them at their establishment. 

One of the staff told us how sorry they were that they got behind in the kitchen and took 45 minutes to serve our food. I am glad that they are so busy and appreciated the apology, but they probably should have thrown in something like dessert for free after making us wait such a long time. 

If you go to Pai you will not be disappointed and I do need to go back and try their versions of some of my favourites.

At this point I still might be partial to Sukho Thai which provides more value or Koh San Road, where I was introduced to some of my favourites in the first place. I will update this post the next time I go back to Pai."}
{"text":"I just walked 30mins to Pai and back to pick up your delicious Shrimp Pad Thai..only to return home and find \"CHICKEN\" pad Thai in my take out container"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai restaurant I've ever been! Everything was fantastic! Tried the deep fried squash to start followed by the egg noodle curry! Everything tastes fresh and is super flavourful! Everyone needs to try it. My husband has the Pad Thai, which was also very good. The service we good. We did wait 45 minutes for a table, but it was worth the wait. Very busy place which tells me it's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Pai Toronto is comparable to Khao San Road, if not better because of the overall experience.

Food: ordered the green curry chicken in the coconut: it had a nice spicy kick and the curry was full of flavour

Atmosphere: much better than Khao San Road as there was an abundant amount of tables and a full serving bar; it had a very casual modernistic feel

Service: the restaurant was busy on a Friday night but the servers were friendly and efficient

I definitely will come back here again and try their famous pad thai. Make reservations in advance if you plan on coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"We use Pai to cater our office lunches and they're great. Their troughs of food almost always come on time or early, and their catering options are definitely worth the price. Always enough to share and always enough flavor to spice up our regular sandwiches or salad options."}
{"text":"Honestly I've eaten here many times but each time I go I get great, friendly and fast service which is really impressive because Pai is on of the most consistently delicious Thai places in Toronto. Their Pad Grow is one of my favourite comfort foods, their Chef Nuit Thai is always a winner and their Khao Soo noodles in golden curry literally impresses everyone I know who tries it. It's hard to get seating for more than 2 people sitting peak lunch and dinner times but you can get reservations or order from their marketplace in the back. I go here at least once every two weeks and andissues absolutely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"This would be on the higher end for Thai food, even though I prefer my Thai food that is basic, this was an excellent meal full of flavours and ingredients. I had a tamarind soup which was a bit to acidic for me and i thought the bowl being on top of a flame was a bit weird, nevertheless it had flavour and the shrimps were huge. Nice job, will come back again"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I went here on a date and we had to wait over an hour for a table, not something I personally like doing, but it speaks to how much people love the food here. 

We had the Miang Kung appetizer, which came with a lot of fresh ingredients and you wrap them with shrimp and betel leaves and dip in a tamarind sauce - it was refreshing, delicious and very satisfying. The best dish we had that night.

The green curry and khao soi were also delicious. I would definitely go here often if the wait is shorter. I had food from here delivered before and it just isn't the same as when you eat at the restaurant. Please expand your restaurant Pai :)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had. Both the green curry and golden (yellow) was rich and not over whelming. The atmosphere was equally as interesting. We were never let down here."}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco, but spent a year living in Bangkok, and have traveled all around Thailand. I can safely say this is one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to. I make business trips to Toronto and come here every time, multiple times. I order half the menu each time. The food is phenomenal, and true to Thai style. Added bonus, they have done a decent job making the interior actually feel like northern Thailand/Chiangmai/Pai. If you're in Toronto, don't hesitate, come here immediately."}
{"text":"This was a nice casual first dinner during our 3-day stay in Toronto. I ordered a pretty spicy Pad Thai and I'll admit it was out of control. This is coming from someone who can handle her heat. I loved it though and the flavors were beautiful.

We tried a pitcher of the sangria but my fiancée and I couldn't taste any alcohol so I'm not sure if that was worth it.

Overall, the prices are great and we would return."}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving Thai food for lunch so we came here. 

Food:

Pad Gra Prow 13...Try it with Shrimp or Crispy Pork (Moo Grob) 15
Holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground Pork, Chicken, Beef or Tofu served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. (contains oyster sauce) Served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime)

I wanted to try both shrimp and pork at the same time. I preferred the ground pork over the crispy pork in the rice. It was nicely marinated and flavourful! I've asked for their chili oil. It went well with the rice. 

Nice happy atmosphere. Good service and very authentic Thai good. I am so glad I came!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for a Friday/Saturday night.

The food is consistently good - I get the grabong squash fritters and vegetarian pad thai every time.

Ambiance is equally as good - it is loud and busy, which I think is the best atmosphere for a casual drink (or two) with friends or even a date. 

There's a coziness to Pai that I adore, with rustic decor and vintage ornaments randomly strung around the restaurant.

Be prepared to wait up to an hour during peak dinner time, but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The freshness and veggie friendly dishes makes this our go to thai place. Great for a lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Though it's quickly becoming packed like Khao San Road, it's still a good choice for the area.

The Khao Soi (with tofu for me) is great to warm up during the winter months, and still tasty the rest of the year.  Chef Nuit's Pad Thai is good, but not remarkably better than the pad thai available elsewhere.

It's not as noisy as KSR, and for a little while it was easier to get in.  That's quickly changing as people in the area are becoming aware of it's relationship to other great options around."}
{"text":"Worth the hype! Finally got to try this place today! Friend warned me that the wait is always long but today we only waited 20 min for a group of 6.

I got the chicken pad Thai with Thai ice tea and it was some of the best Thai food ever. I loveeeeee the Thai iced tea! It's so creamy and has a very nice tea flavour, prolly the best I've had. The pad Thai was super flavourful and noodles were perfect. I also tried my friends pad gra prow and it was just as yummy.

Service started off slow but picked up near the end. I really enjoyed the experience here and it is def worth all the hype."}
{"text":"Nice place.  It's huge, and you have to go down a big set of stairs, as it's below ground level.  The wait For a table, though, was atrocious.  The host lied to us, and said we'd be seated fairly quickly, but it was 30 minutes later that we finally were led to our table.  

That was also a bit weird 'cause we were put in a separate, private room, but seated at one long table with another party.  

So, my first impression was not positive, but I felt better after the good came.  Everything was really tasty. Portions were quite large.  I only ate half my portion.  Service was good too."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! The atmosphere, the food, the service, the story behind the restaurant, everything is excellent. These two people met and fell in love in Pai and they decided to bring back their love of cooking and of Pai to Toronto. How amazing is that???!!

My high school friend took my boyfriend and I here on our last day. He says it's a popular spot amongst Ryerson students. 

Upon entering it just had the feel of authenticness and creativity. We only ordered a pad thai to share because we were planning on hitting more spots later in the day. Although it was hard to resist the plates of good food that the servers were bringing everyone else.
We got it really mild and it was so good. Lots of well blended flavours and textures. 

You NEED to come here. 

Visited on July 2nd 2017"}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is good however too busy and you might not get everything on time. But it's nice overall."}
{"text":"I loved this place; it was a boiling hot day and just visited the Aquarium nearby with my family. We stumbled across this place for lunch...and wow! Small and unpretentious but with a great atmosphere and fantastic Thai food. We all went with Pad Thai, but word of warning, unless your mouth is made of asbestos, do not go with the very spicy option. The waitress was very sweet."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've had since coming back from Thailand. I'm obsessed with this place and wish I lived closer to Toronto so that I could go back more frequently. The Khao Soi, Pad Gra Praw w/ egg, and the Massaman braised beef were all delectable! Eating in was dope, the vibes of the restaurant are chill and the staff is really friendly and approachable. Can't wait to visit again"}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem in Toronto. From Michigan, and were referred to this place by locals. Had the spring roll, pad Thai, and beef curry dish. All to die for. Would totally go back."}
{"text":"Although I've been told the food here isn't that authentic, it's still one of my favorite Thai food restaurant in Toronto. I love the busy environment for dinner with one to two friends. I find if I go with too many people then you can't really hear what everyone's saying because it's loud. I especially love Kaosoi, a curry dish with noodles, for its rich flavor and balance between the texture of the noodles and fried noodles. I think their Thai ice tea and coconut water are good too. I never order the Thai ice tea just for myself since it's quite sweet but coconut water is a must if I'm having something spicy.

It's a good place to go with a close friend or someone who you know well. I find the place loud so if you're really trying to get to know each other you might not be able to hear them well."}
{"text":"Expect to wait long if your not here before 5:30pm. The line up for this place is massive and sometimes out the door. The location is in a basement which also makes it a bit hot down there. The food and vibe is great ... very relaxed and chill. The staff and service is friendly and they are quick to help. Our waiter was a great efficient guy. Forgot his name though. We ordered the Kao Soi, Fried pumpkin fries, Pad thai, Curry Chicken and a bowl of white rice. Oh and don't forget to order the Mango smoothie or the Thai Ice Tea! To die for. All the flavors are so strong and flavorful, I love it.   Just please remember to arrive before 5:30 (this applies to all week long) because of the long line up.  Since we arrived at 6:00pm, we waited about 30 minutes for a table. But if you arrive even later around 7pm, good luck getting a table."}
{"text":"Really tasty! My gf and I came in one day after work and it had a great vibe! We stuffed our face with yummy tacos and drunk off their delicious drinks! I definitely want to take my bf here next time!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service... but make a Reservation!! or else you will be waiting. Green curry is a must try!"}
{"text":"Good taste. Carefully select spicy level. It is spicy"}
{"text":"East meet West. Perfect for joint for Hipsters. The food is not the greatest. It does fool alot of people. Its pretty loud in there. If you on a date and don't like to talk not a bad place to be. If you want to have a good conversation. Make sure you are good with sign language. 

Price for the food is ok not bad. Service can be better but you get what you paid for. Wash down Thai food perfect for Canadians."}
{"text":"Pai (named after a town in northern Thailand by the Burmese border) is one of the most distinctive Thai restaurants in all of Toronto. Specializing in northern Thai cuisine (which has more of a connection with Burmese/Myanamese cuisine). Catering to large lunch and dinner crowds and with reservations sometimes booked weeks in advance (it took two weeks to land a group reservation for eight people due to the popularity of this restaurant). Offering some traditional dishes also found in southern Thailand, but with less grease than some of the places and a special touch of northern Thai cooking (e.g. fried egg on some dishes; oyster sauce), the food is so distinctive it sets this restaurant worlds apart from other Thai restaurants.

Service is great, however, please either make reservations or arrive before the lunch/dinner crowds arrive to get a table at this place."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try Pai! I've been meaning to try this place for a while and have always been discouraged by the long line ups. 
Now I understand the hype! 
Came here on a Sunday around 6pm, and waited around 30 mins for a table. Ordered some drinks: Sangria and Tea Mac (thai iced tea + vodka) highly recommended if you're a fan of Thai iced tea. 
For dinner, we had the chicken satay with peanut sauce (good flavours), chicken Pad Thai (pretty good), but the star of the meal was the Pad Gra Prow with beef - highly recommend this dish! 
Overall: good, efficient service, good drinks, great food, would def return, and maybe even wait a bit longer!"}
{"text":"There was a 40 minute wait for a table and we ended up sitting at the bar. We had no complaints. Great sake deal and the green curry was delectable! I love thai food and this was toward the top of the list for curries in my book! Kind service even though they were quite busy, and the atmosphere was great. I felt like I was really on vacation! I definitely recommend this place to those who love thai in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great value. Had the soup and Pad Thai and a curry. 
EXCELLENT - Best Ive had yet in the city, topping my last standing fave the Thai room. 
very nice textures, seasoning and perfectly cooked. 
Will be ordering from here regularly.
The  Khao Soi - Too spicy for the Bf, not spicy enough for me... Next time.. two orders, twice as happy."}
{"text":"Ever since Pai opened, I've had countless of recommendations to visit immediately. My friends repeatedly gushed over the food, something that was rarely done, especially in front of me as drool literally slipped from mouth to floor.With a salivation level that high, I made it a mission to detour from my prior dinner plans to eat at Pai.

Although being on the waitlist is a given here, the drinking lounge is surprisingly large and arranged just like the dining room- only serving snacks and drinks while you wait. I suggest a reservation, since they take them here at least a day in advance!

The atmosphere is lively, casual, and fun because I get the feeling like I'm inside a hut or house. The place is decked out in wood, brick and unpolished trim. What was most eye-catching was the spinning barrel filled with ice and beer, right when you walk in. Apparently you get something called \"Jelly Beer\" from this, a beer slushie of sorts, from the shaking ice cold water. I ordered a Singha beer to see what this was about, I got a cold beer without the \"jelly.\" I guess they didn't think I was ready for this jelly, because baby I probably couldn't handle it

The wait for the food was on the slower side. There were only 2 servers working with a front of the house manager as well. They seemed understaffed but I'm not sure, all I know was that it took a while for the food to arrive despite the kind and helpful waitress.

The menu was two sided, drinks and snacks on one and entrees and salads on the other among other things. I ordered a bunch of dishes:

The most surprisingly great dish of the night was the papaya salad ($14). We ordered it with salted crab instead of the dried shrimp. I was told that the crab was there purely for the flavor, not for eating. The combination of sweet, salty, sour and spicy from the green papaya, chili, tamarind, fish sauce, and lime was on another level.

The Gaeng Hunglay ($15) was a ginger curry that was more stew-ish than anything. The pork belly pieces were incredibly tender, like cut with a spoon tender, while the sauce was a balanced sweet and savory.

The Pad Thai ($14) was really tasty as well. Unlike the fast food versions, this was brown in color and not red. Less sour than you typically expect (which I like) but all the other flavours are there.

The Pad Gra Prow ($15) looks like a simple dish of stir-fry ground beef on rice with an egg, but of course it's not. Deceivingly simple in appearance, the flavours are punched up with basil while the textures add another special dimension you don't expect either.

The Khao Pad Thamada with Chicken ($15) was visually underwhelming, a bit muted with the lack of color. The flavours however, are good but remind me of any fried rice dish out there.
 
Overall, I really enjoyed the food at Pai. Despite the amount of hype and high expectations my friends set it up to be, it certainly, somehow, delivered! The flavours and textures of Thai food are inherently bold and robust. Pai is able to create dishes capturing the true essence of Thai cuisine in their own way at affordable prices and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey but honestly worth it. It's one of those restaurants you always see hipsters in their 20s in in those indie rom-com films. You have to wait a while to get a table (15-20) minutes but once you're in the food takes no time at all to come. It's also a great spot to take pictures. It only really gets busy after 5 by virtue of its location."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever tasted. Came here several times and it's super busy!
Tip: Come right at the opening hour! This place gets packed in the first 30 minutes!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is unreal. I had the Pad Thai both times because I was craving it for days after I had it the first time. The Thai tea is super good, as is the lemongrass iced tea, super refreshing! My friends had a few different dishes and all of them were very pleased with their meals. I will definitely be back for more pad thai, and maybe to try something new at Pai!!"}
{"text":"Perfect dinner.  At least as good as anything I've eaten in Thailand.  Pad Gra Prow with Moo Grab (pork belly) was out of this world.  Reservations not taken for the same day; wait time on a rainy Friday night (during a Blue Jays game) was about 15 minutes. Friendly, precise service. Delicious food. Decent prices (about CAD 15 / main course). Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went there last year but I forgot to make a review.

The place is kind of grungy but it reminded me of the night life of the North Gate Jazz Bar in Chiang Mai.  The Khao Soi was actually better than the Khao Soi that I had in Thailand.  They also sell Tiger Beer which is a great plus.

10/10 would dine again."}
{"text":"The first time I had Pai was as catering for a staff training session and I absolutely fell in love. I was raving about the food for months before I actually went to their physical location.

The restaurant itself is loud, dark, and hectic, but definitely has a fun vibe. As someone with a lower voice, unfortunately it was a little difficult to communicate with my dining partner.

The food was tasty, although not as fantastic as my first experience with it. I will credit it to being a busy lunch service when I decided to dine in. I will have to try again on a less peak period."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. Atmosphere, food, music, free wifi, friendly service. Don't pass this place up if you have the chance to visit Toronto."}
{"text":"This time I had the pad gra prow (with beef) and I think it has taken over the green curry as my new favourite dish! Also had the squash fritters which were really good!"}
{"text":"The line to get checked in was out the door. There's still a 20-30 minute wait after.

Attentive servers, food came out quick. Had the Pai Pad Thai and Pai sangria. The sangria consisted of lychees at the bottom, however was a little weak on the alcohol. But the pad Thai was redeeming. You get to choose from 4 different spice levels. The dish overall was flavourful and wouldn't mind a repeat."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal! Best Thai food I've ever had. The spring rolls had incredible flavor and the dipping sauce was divine. I had khao soi which was fantastic!! Will for sure eat here again my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for about 2 months ! I had high expectations about it !! Let's say expectations were meet food is good something to remember the green curry is creamy and full of flavour but not heavy spring rolls are fresh and flavourful even though are fried , hot sauce is not your average sriracha is a beautiful slightly salty Chili oil , and best part the place is so hip and different from your regular Thai restaurant , prices are average and quality is there , make reservations ahead place is always packed"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in this part of town. Ambience, food, and service has never let me down and I keep coming back whenever I'm forced to eat in the area."}
{"text":"great deal if a northern thai restaurant. very nice atmosphere, staff and cuisine. the thai ice tea is a must."}
{"text":"Love this place !! 
Love the atmosphere ! 
Like the music - not sure how Bob Marley fits, but would have liked some Thai music maybe.  
Love the service !! 

Shared the Shrimp appetizer - it was just okay. 

Ordered Signha beer - yummy - tasted like beer should taste !!

We ordered the green chicken curry served in a coconut !!! Fantastic and delicious ! 

We mentioned to our server that we were going to Thailand later this year and he gave us some great travel tips !! 

I'm sure we will be back before our trip to try a few more items as they have a really large selection of items and it's real authentic Thai food"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night around 9:15 pm and the place was packed. They have a happening bar area. The decor inside is trendy. 
Nice cocktail and beer list. Cool mule was refreshing. Lots of vegetarian options. The taste is where all the stars are worth. Service for a busy time was efficient. Ask for the hot sauce it's so spicy. 
Pad gra prow with tofu and a fried egg was tasty as hell. The pad cha hett was equally tasty with the veggies and mushrooms. The gaeng panang was flavorful and a safe dish one can't go wrong with. 
A must visit if you want Thai cuisine right in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing thai food ! Very authentic and not your typical thai like your Thai Express ! 

Ive tried different restaurants under this group and Pai is definitely the best hands down. You must try the curry noodle ( khao soi ) wow that is the best thing on the menu and no one else can beat it . The pad gra was also good but its nothing spectacular as its just minced meat over rice and fish sauce . The morning glory ( stir fried vegetables) is out of this world ! Its a must !!! 

Avoid the lettuce wraps and spring rolls as they are not great nor bad but you can def do without and try something else ! 

And finally the tom yum soup is very authentic and def worth getting !"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last week and the food was really yummy.  I ordered the pad Thai with tofu and veggies, medium spicy. Other than the waitress' recommendation that medium was going to be very spicy (it was actually quite mild), I'd say everything was perfect!  Service was quick after being seated (we were told we'd have an hour wait, which ended up only being 35min - yay!), great ambiance for a casual dinner. Will definitely be back and look forward to trying more things!"}
{"text":"I found this place because it was most reviewed on yelp. The restaurant is located in a basement. I sat at the bar and ordered the khao soi- egg noodles in curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions and braised beef. Egg noodles are not my preferred choice, but I enjoyed the curry. There was also plenty of tender pieces of beef to be found. I can see why this restaurant is so popular."}
{"text":"We went there last night and had the worst experience ever. As usual there was a wait time of 15 min and we said we would be ok with the spot at the bar table if it came up earlier. We got a table at the bar after about I think 10 min and while we were sitting down at the bar chair, something poked my friend at the inner thigh .. the chair looked clean and there wasn't anything we could find but she was in so much pain that she had to go to the bathroom to check it out.. she came in 2 min saying there is something pierced inside and she isn't able to remove it and is hurting. I went back in with her and found a piece of sharp wood almost like a 1 inch needle poked inside her back of the thigh. I realized that was from the chair. We went back in and showed it to the guys upfront and they said they could change our seats if we want but we will have to wait. We asked for a bandaid and they got it for us.. they did not apologize or were really sorry for what had happened. I saw them offer those same seats to someone without even checking the chair!! I was beyond shocked. Their food could be good and so is good at other Thai places in the city like khao San road , I was disappointed with the way this was handled. Not going back here ever again!"}
{"text":"We were a group of four and came on a Saturday night at around 8:00pm. It was mad busy. I'm guessing this is a popular spot for pre-drinks and grabbing a quick bite before heading off to enjoy the vibrant night life of the Financial District. (I might be wrong. I only go out like twice a year.) 

Anyway, Pai was suuuuuuper crowded. We were told there would be a one hour wait before getting a table for a group of four. In the end, we only waited about 20 minutes since they gave us seats in the no-drinking area (it was fine by us, but if you're looking for drinks, you're gonna be waiting a while). 

There were a lot of things we wanted to try, but the kitchen was out of a lot of ingredients, which was kind of annoying. It was a constant back and forth of \"we'll get item X\" and \"sorry we're out of that\" between us and the waiter. In the end, we went with vegetarian spring rolls, som tum tad (papaya salad), khao soi (egg noodles in creamy golden curry), gaeng kiaw wan (spicy green curry), and pad cha hett (king oyster mushroom dish).

The spring rolls were average. Everything else was great! The papaya salad was perfectly spicy. The green curry was supposed to come in a coconut but they had run out of coconut (lol) so it came in a regular bowl. It was super spicy and I personally had a really tough time with it (I'm hella weak when it comes to spicy food), so if you can't tolerate spicy then definitely avoid. The khao soi was soooooo good. It was super creamy and just all around yummy. My favorite was the king oyster mushroom. Definitely something I would want to re-order. 

Anyway, despite the fact that they were out of a lot of items, the food we got was still pretty darn good! Would definitely go back for more oyster mushroom."}
{"text":"The thing is, I really do love Pai - but only when I dine in. The difference in food quality between take-out and dine-in is noticeable and bordering on ridiculous, so much so that it's driven me to join Yelp and write my first review.

I always order the Pad Thai with tofu and veggies, Thai spicy. The two times I've dined in, the spice and heat of the dish were on point - my mouth was just on the cusp of catching fire, precisely the way I like it. Take-out, on the other hand, is bland, totally lacking in flavour. The noodles are barely coated in sauce and the dish as a whole just looks and tastes watered down.

I don't know what's causing this inconsistency and considerable difference in quality, but I hope they're able to identify and address it. Otherwise, Khao San Road will be my go-to whenever my Thai craving hits."}
{"text":"Amazing thai food. The Pad thai is excellent and the kao soi was really good as well. 
The  atmosphere is great and the service was good.
Went there Saturday night and the wait time was short. 
If you like Khao San Road, you're going to love this one!!!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls were a delicious starter.  I had the Pad Gra Prow with chicken as my main and it was pretty yummy.  However, I just wish the fried egg on top was a tiny bit less cooked.  It would have been perfect if it had been just slightly runny when I cut into it."}
{"text":"My girls and I visited Toronto during Christmas/NYE week a few months ago and we decided to check out Pai while we were in town. Now, I'm a die-hard Thai fanatic - it's my favorite cuisine ever! Imagine how extremely disappointed I was after my unpleasant experience at this establishment. 

For starters, the food wasn't extraordinary - it's exactly what I expected. 

Our dining experience was horrible! We were seated around 2pm-ish on NYE and were served our drinks and apps in a timely fashion. We had to track down our waiter though to put in our entree orders and to our dismay he never passed it along to the person taking over his shift. We waited for a ridiculously long time to be served our food. If I remember correctly, we were in the restaurant for about two hours and our food had yet to be delivered to our table. 

I was so appalled at the lack of customer service that I spoke to the Manager and explained what happened. They apologized profusely and offered complimentary apps and 50% off of the check. I appreciate the effort that they took in trying to resolve the issue and our disappointment; however, it wasn't until later on that I realized we didn't truly get 50% off the check. Of course, the restaurant calculated it to their advantage. I still left a tip because I'm the type of customer who doesn't let one bad experience dictate future ones.

I do want to advise other customers to have minimum expectations when dining here and speak up if you're not happy with the level of service."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable. It was the best Thai food I've ever had-the flavor was excellent and they did not load up on MSG at all because I wasn't thirsty or sleepy after eating several different dishes with colleagues. This will definitely be my go to spot next time I'm in Toronto. Their drinks were also very delicious - the Thai mojito was my favorite."}
{"text":"This place had such great reviews, so at the very least, I expected the food to be enjoyable. Boy i was wrong. The four of us were so excited when we looked at the food and drink menu. Everything looked great! Once we started our meals, we all shared the same disappointed look. A unanimous ehh. None of us finished our food. The icing on the cake though, was that 2 of us actually got sick. I myself, threw up in their bathroom. While my friend did hers back at our hotel. Completely ruined our last night in Toronto. The ONLY reason i did not give this place one star was because my drink before my meal was delicious. I had the tom yum caesar. Spiciest drink i've ever had, hands down. I loved it though. So much flavor and spice. Seems like the drinks are great. So I recommend going their for drinks and appetizers. Stay away from the entrees."}
{"text":"So my coworkers and I decided to make a visit to Pai to get some authentic Thai food as the food choices around my office is bad. It is quite a walk from my office to Pai. But we ordered ahead through Ritual and it is hassle free. 

I ordered the Thai Fried Rice and this is so good that I was like WOW! Added some fish sauce and the lime. WOW! The flavour just kicked up a notch. The only comment I had is after a bit of a walk back to the office, the rice became a bit soggy. So not really anyone's fault. Just how takeouts are. So my experience with the rice is still good, just minus the sogginess. I am coming back again either for lunch or take out. And yes, I must try the curry. 

I do have a comment regarding the restaurant. So when I got in, I felt the air was a bit stuffy. So I felt a bit disoriented. Just a thought."}
{"text":"Yummmmy! It is hard to find good Northern Thai in Toronto. The curry was so flavourful. The rest of the dishes at the table looked great. They spice fairly aggressively so beware if you are not good with spicy. I went the second to most spicy and it was very authentic. Solid yet impersonal service. Small but good beer choices."}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting Toronto and can honestly say this is the best Thai food I've ever had. It is worth the wait! Best part is that you can enjoy appetizers and drinks at the side bar while waiting to be seated. This came in clutch with a hangry partner. We started with the spring rolls and shrimp. Both incredibly delicious and fresh. We both had Pad Thai with chicken which was really good and had a nice kick to it (you can choose your own level of spice). Overall the dish had a great combination of tastes and textures. Highly recommend! We also shared a couple pictures of the sangria... drink this! Delicious sangria with pineapples and actual lychee pieces. It went down too smooth. ;) Highly recommend this place for locals and passerbyers alike!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. One of the best Thai places in Toronto. The wait is quite long but if you arrive after 9 on a weekday there should be no wait."}
{"text":"POSITIVES:

Amazing food.

Great service.

Exciting and energetic environment.

NEGATIVES:

The mf line is always so fucking long... but the wait isn't horrible. Better if you go in a group greater than 3 imo.

All in all the process adds to the experience which is pretty cool. ENJOY!

GET THE CHEF NUIT PAD THAI!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it's still consistently good! I brought some first timers here and they really enjoyed the food. 

Ordered the Pad Thai, Masaman braised beef curry, and Khao Pla Tawt. Of course we also had to order the Thai iced tea! Everything is fairly priced, maybe with the exception of the Thai iced tea (only because I think $5 is more than I expected for it) 

Would recommend everything that we ordered! It's usually really hard to find a Thai place that uses braised beef for their Masaman curry, which I find makes a difference, which is why I always order it when I come here. The beef is so soft and good. The same goes for the Pad Thai, taste is on point! This is the first time trying the Khao Pla Tawt but honestly we loved it too. The fish was fried but it was still moist AND the sauces that it comes with are so good (one sweet and one spicy). 

Will continue to come here and eat the delicious food!"}
{"text":"It's ok I had better Thai food. It seems to cater to the mass of peeps who wants to experience Thai food for the 1st time. For those who come back to each his own right:)"}
{"text":"Went there with two friends on weekdays after work. We waited a little bit (around 5 mins), not a long lineup. Seat was comfortable but the light was too dark for a restaurant, I barely see the items and pictures on the menu. I ordered chicken pai thai, portion is large but they should have cut the chicken smaller. Sauce is great but the dish is classic, so no surprise. Price is reasonable for the food you get, so generally a good experience."}
{"text":"average Thai restaurant. I like their pad thai and thai ice tea"}
{"text":"What more can I say than what has already been said?  Food was great. I recommend making a reservation. I was able to skip the long lines and get my table exactly at the time promised."}
{"text":"I had the green curry chicken.  Amazing meal! Definitely recommend going there.  My friends who were with me recently came back from Asia said the food was very authentic and a perfect place to go to if your craving a good pad thai."}
{"text":"I ate here with some friends who work close by. I really enjoyed eating here. They had good food. I had the Pad Gra Prow. I have only really had this in Toronto. I highly enjoyed eating it here. It had a great balance of spices and flavors. I also love the menu! It was super tasty!!

I kind of felt lke the place used to be like a pub, and was converted in a thai place. I enjoyed the decor, and i like that they had places to hang your coat, You aren't too close or too far from the people that you are eating next to, thus you neither feel crowded nor abandoned. The service is good. I recommend it."}
{"text":"My second time here after trying it out last summer and it's just as good as I remembered! Hands down, one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city. This place is always packed no matter what time you go but the great thing is they take reservations (unlike Khao San Road). The atmosphere is always loud and lively, the decor is new with a rustic feel, built like you're inside a hut. For the most part, there is either communal seating or tables fitting 2-5 available. However, they do have a private party room if you're looking to host something with a bigger group. 

Onto the food,

Chef Nuit Pad Thai w/ Chicken ($15) - Honestly one of the best pad thais out there.   Everything about this dish is perfection. Filled with simple ingredients and mixed with the right amount of sauce, you get an explosion of flavors that'll have you thinking about it well after the meal. It's a good portion too.

Khao Soi w/ Chicken Breast ($15) - I don't think anywhere can beat Khao San Road's khao soi but this one is quite up there and I would highly recommend ordering it. It's very filling as they give a substantial amount of meat and egg noodles. The crispy noodles add an extra dimension to the dish but the highlight is still the golden curry. I was so tempted to order an extra bowl of rice or wished there was bread to eat with the curry just so it wouldn't go to waste.

Khao Pla Tawt ($14.50) - They make fried fish really well here as it's perfectly crispy without being too oily. Comes with tamarind sauce and chili sauce to dip along with a bowl of white rice. I preferred the tamarind sauce more because I felt it complemented the fish a little better.  It's not a bad choice but I found it a bit boring to just eat fried fish with rice. And so, I would recommend the next item below: 

Fried Fish w/ Green Curry Sauce and Rice ($13) - Get this if you come for lunch since it's not on the dinner menu!! Pretty much exactly like the Khao Pla Tawt with the exception of the two dipping sauces and instead, you get green curry. I'm not sure why but they only have the Khao Pla Tawt in the evening but I much prefer this one. I can't remember but they probably only give 3 pieces of fish instead of 4 and portions are inevitably smaller but it's much more flavorful. Pour the curry over the rice, have it with the fish and voila.

My only complaint was the amount of time it took for the food to come out. I think we waited almost 30 minutes so I did get a little antsy since I was starving. But all that was forgiven and forgotten after I took a bite.

Pai is a must-try!!"}
{"text":"EDIT: This is actually meant for the other restaurant down the road. Khao San Road is the name, I believe.



I was visiting from out of town and really had a craving for Drunken Noodles. Though there were many Thai places around the area, this restaurant seemed to be the most inventive and had great reviews. It was during Caribana and it was also a holiday weekend so the line was to be expected but seeing as I was ordering my food to go, I was hoping that the wait would not be as long. 

The wait took a long time and there was no place to sit and wait. Literally had to go to the sub store next door to wait. The hostess was also very rude to people as they waited to be served. She almost got into a heated argument with a patron as well which is why I'm giving them 4 stars.

Otherwise, the food is AMAZING and I love how you can be very specific about the spice level. I ordered drunken noodles with chicken and a pad Graw po (sp)which had chicken and the egg on top. Sooooooo good and soooooo flavorful. Would definitely order both again but I would call ahead first. They also take cards with chips which is great for International travelers. 

Overall - best thai food I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot express how amazing the food quality is here. Although you have to wait in line to get seated, the food makes up for it. The portions are way more than expected especially the Fritters and Pad Thai. With a shared app and a main dish, I could barely eat half my entree or even finish the fritters. In regards to the ambience, if you're into a hip and loud environment this is the way to go especially with a small group. If you're looking for an intimate spot with privacy - this will be a bit difficult. I've dined and ordered out and to be honest take out takes a bit of time but once you take you first bite - you'll forget all about it. 4/5 stars just because of the wait time."}
{"text":"Amazing service. The fish was cooked to perfection. Perfectly crispy outside and perfectly soft and mouthwatering on the inside. The green curry was amazing too!"}
{"text":"This is my go to when someone asks for a great place to eat thai food. I work around the corner at a hotel and when guests ask for a hip place to eat at. This is it.  The quality of food is amazing and the flavour is almost quite similar to real thai food. I've been to thailand and the noodles are spot on. The only downfall is that you cannot make reservations and are only on a first come first serve basis. It's almost always busy and quite noisy. But that's the atmosphere they're going for especially having a bar. Limited menu but excellent food."}
{"text":"HOLY. SH**. I'd give this place 10 stars if Yelp had the option. Come here if you want your mind blown away because that's exactly what happened to me. 

I came here super hungover from the night before and had no idea where my friends were taking me for lunch. I was way too hungover to care to even look at the menu so I just told my boyfriend to order for me (which is extremely unlike me). He got me the pad gra prow w/ thai crispy pork and got himself the green curry chicken with noodles. It didn't look like anything special to me so I thought it was just normal thai food. Boy was I wrong. I took my first bite and was SO blown away. I forgot that I was hungover and nauseous and devoured everything. I took my boyfriend's food, I took my friends' food, if I could I would've tried the whole menu. 
All my friends are from Boston and I think we can all agree that we would suffer the 9 hour drive to Toronto just to eat at Pai again. Bravo to the owner(s) and chefs. No thai food will ever taste the same. 


I will be back to Toronto one day just to come here to eat."}
{"text":"They have a small lunch menu here but the choices all sound delicious...Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup, Massaman with Braised Beef and Rice, Thai Omelette with Ground Pork and Rice, and Khao Soi to name a few.  Also not the typical choices you have at most Thai restaurants, which is a nice change of pace.  It's like a menu of Thai comfort food.  

For my first time here, I dined in.  A couple of my friends ordered the Tom Yum soup and raved about it.  It looked pretty good loaded with shrimps, mushrooms and whatnots.  I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she said everything is good but one of her favorites is the Pad Gra Prow.  After going with that, I decided I could dine here every day and did so for the next 3 days.  I'm hesitant to order the pad Thai because I tried a bite of my friend's pad Thai and didn't like it (soggy and bland).  

Pad Gra Prow (pork with basil) with Fried Egg ($12) - One of my favorite dishes in Thailand but is rarely done right elsewhere.  However, they did it very right here, top notch. The flavors were authentic (could be saltier as it was on the sweet side) and delicious!  It even came with a side of chili fish sauce (prik nam pla!), which was not needed, but was nice to be offered.  The pork was minced to perfection.  The portion of rice given was also spot on.

Thai Omelette with ground pork and rice $12 was absolutely tasty.  This is not your traditional omelette as it was deep fried scramble eggs.  It had ground pork but it also had dried shredded pork (moo yong), which I haven't had in the longest time.  There were also basil, onion and red pepper that added to the great flavor of this dish.

Massaman with Braised Beef and Rice $12 - If you're in the mood for coconut based red curry, tender beef, and potatoes, you'll like this dish.  There are also onions and peanuts in here which I really enjoyed.

Thai chicken fried rice $11 - It was ok, kinda plain.  I got it as a takeout and it could have used some fish sauce.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any at the office.  Where's the prik nam pla when I needed it?

Small Tom Yum Soup $5 - This soups is pretty good.  I got it medium spicy and it was just the right amount of spiciness.  There were 2 jumbo shrimps in the soup.

Thai Ice Tea ($4.50) - They didn't have Thai ice coffee, so I went with this.  It's a bit more expensive than other places, but they do give you a big cup of it.  

Mango and sticky rice $8 - One of my favorite Thai desserts.  It was good here, but not quite $8 good.   I'll can go to Sabai Sabai for my Thai dessert fix for $5.

The service was friendly.  The décor is nice and gives the place a Thai ambience and not just Thai themed.  The take out counter is in the back towards the kitchen.  They take credit cards, including American Express.

I read that the owners are also part owners of Sukho Thai and consultants at Sabai Sabai and used to be associated with Khao San Road."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, which is a great sign.  I've been here twice now, and my experience both times was extremely positive.  This is likely the best Thai food in the city, as far as I'm concerned.  The Green Coconut Curry is outstanding.  Try their wings appetizer, and you will not be disappointed.  Enjoy your meal with a spiced rum and coke..."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for Thai food in Toronto. We went there for late lunch, got there around 2:30ish and the place was packed. We were able to find a table and the food was fantastic. I'd definitely go here very often if I live or work nearby."}
{"text":"Came back again and ordered the same food (khao soi and the green curry in coconut) and also ordered chef nuit pad thai. Khao soi still taste wonderful and the pad thai is definitely the best one I've ever had! The green curry had too strong of a herb taste and it was too overwhelming. 
The Thai iced tea is still my favourite!
The servers are really nice too."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place if you like Thai Food. The atmosphere was great (if you like the clean pub/social feel) Great taste in music and the waiters were very nice. I started off with some soup, Tom yum kung, and it was delicious, exactly what I expected with the great burst of flavor (sour and spicy). For my meal, I got the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My craving was instantly satisfy as the flavor and hot-ness level was perfect. Overall, if you want thai food, they will give you thai food. Great spot for socializing or even a date. The only thing that I did not like was that you had to pay for tea. Definitely will be going back there and recommending it as it was a great experience."}
{"text":"It has been so long since I had food that made me want to return to restaurant the next day for more. Pai is outstanding Thai. It really deserves the praise it gets and it different than the tonnes of Thai restaurants in city. We shared apps (spring rolls tasty not greasy) then the beef soup and mushroom stir fry. All delicious. Great portions. No sodium/msg headache after. Definitely will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Love Thai food and came here because they offer Halal beef options. It is very authentic Thai food, the curries we ordered was very tasty. We also ordered Pad Thai with beef and it was delicious. The shrimp soup was very good, it was a little too spicy and I would recommend asking for mild if that is possible. We would come here without any hesitation."}
{"text":"So I visited Pai on Friday on the recommendation of a few coworkers. Verdict: Glad I came.
Had to have lunch at 2:00 pm as it was so hard to get an earlier reservation.  I definitely advise you reserve rather than show up here as it's busy always.
So for starters, we ordered the spring rolls and kung tawt shrimp. Both were very tasty, but slightly over fried. We had wanted to order the chicken wings but couldn't justify paying $5.00 for only 3 wings. A little much.
For drinks, we had water and spicy ginger beer(bottled).  $4.00 was a too much for the small sized bottle I received.
For our main dishes: I had the Khao Soi with chicken (2 drumsticks) and my guest had the good old staple of Pad Thai with chicken.
My meal was amazing, but not as spicy as I would have preferred although I did request additional chilis be used. Fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions and your choice of Braised Beef, Chicken Breast or Chicken Drumsticks (contains shrimp paste)---menu description
The flavour was indescribable. My only concern was the mess factor. I wasn't expecting the amount of broth it came with and ended up wearing some home as it was splashing everywhere.
My guest, she thoroughly enjoyed her pad thia..one of the best she has tasted, in her words.
Overall, really enjoyed this place. I wished there were more options on the menu. I would have loved a mango salad but they only offered papaya.
The atmosphere was nice...kinda urban hipster. The music was awesome. I dined while jamming out to some old school hip-hop vibes.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, food was good. Definitely a great place to come if you're having a larger get together. There's definitely things on the menu for everyone!"}
{"text":"I'm very, very surprised by all the praise this place gets.. particularly when it is located in close proximity to Khao San Road, which is better in just about every regard.

Entirely mediocre in all ways.  Pad Thai was decent, still much better than something like Thai Express, but had no delicateness to it.. noodles clumped together and were overly firm/oily.  Red curry was sickly sweet and honestly on the verge of being unappetizing.

Also, something I haven't seen really mentioned here in the reviews, and I think is very important... is that you cannot edit the spice level of any of the dishes except the Pad Thai.  Yes, they'll give you a side of chili oil.. but that doesn't match a place that will tailor your order in the kitchen to the spiciness you want.  This is most evident with their Massaman, which has tons of potential, but is just way too sweet served as is (not 'authentic' at all, even though I keep hearing that adjective get peppered around on here). Even the Pad Thai, which I got extra spicy.. you could tell the actual core of the flavours of the dish were mild, then they just throw in more chilis...

tl;dr -- go to Khao San Road instead.. definitely a better Thai food experience, especially if you have a penchant for heat."}
{"text":"Incredible!  Best Thai food outside of Thailand."}
{"text":"Toronto's Thai scene has really heated up to a solid five chillies out of five chillies.  

We started off with Tom Yum Soup starter size.  The soup was fantastic and a perfect blend of sweet, savoury and spicy.  There were two pieces of shrimp in the soup too.

As an appetizer, we ordered Morning Glory (aka Water Spinach).  The vegetables were cooked well and weren't too fibrous.  It was a little bit greasy but it had a very tasty garlic base.

For mains, we ordered 3 different dishes: the Chef Nuit's Pad Thai, Khao Pla Tawt and Beef Noodle Soup.

Chef Nuit's Pad Thai was pretty darn good.  Portion size was good and chicken was plentiful.  It was solid through and through.  No complaints.

The Kaho Pia Tawt is fried basa fish.  The fish was really crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  It was served with two sauces (fresh chili and tangy tamarind) and a bowl of rice.  This dish is a bit heavy.

The beef soup was also really good.  The broth was a little bit sour, a little bit sweet and despite the fact that we ordered it \"foreigner spicy,\" it wasn't spicy at all.  The beef brisket was variable in texture.  Either too dry or good and juicy.  The quality of the cuts wasn't really top tier but overall good.

The spiciness consistency was a little bit off.  Two different dishes were ordered with the same spiciness level but one dish wasn't really spicy at all, where as the other one produced the satisfying tongue numbness I'd expect.

Decor was certifiably hipster rustic chic with reggae playing in the background.  Bird whistles can be heard when pouring the bottles of water.  Bathrooms were clean and service was solid.

Overall: I'd definitely come back again.  it's another solid Thai restaurant that you can go to.  They accept reservations too."}
{"text":"The Moo Grob is the best thing on the menu! sooo yummy. the restaurant atmosphere is great - very casual and fun. One of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Super crowded, sub-standard pad thai - but wonderful, cheerful, boisterous atmosphere nonetheless.

We arrived on a Saturday at 4:00 PM and it was very, very crowded. Make sure you book reservations prior to coming in, or you'll be waiting, especially if you're with a big group. Our group of 5 ended up sharing a table communally with another couple. No problem. Random, but note that if you're wearing jackets - there's no coat rack, from what we were told. So be prepared to stack your jackets and purses on whatever stool you can find.

I ordered the pad thai (with chicken) and the khao soi (with braised beef). Flavourful to a point, but without the usual tamarind kick that I've come to expect. It was perfectly average. The khao soi came with a delicious broth, but the beef wasn't as tender as I thought it would be. Overall, not the best pad thai or khao soi I've had (to be honest, those awards still go to Khao San Road). They weren't terrible, but they weren't the best. The community atmosphere makes up for the experience - while table spacing wasn't the best, we really enjoyed the decor and overall environment. 

For a pad thai and khao soi (at $15.00 each), I paid $40 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Tasty food. I ordered krapow. I requested Thai hot and it was a perfect balance of hot and taste. I was disappointed that for $18 the quantity of chicken was way less."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmy best Thai food in all of Toronto!!!!!!! 

Tonight, The food was delicious including the pad Thai! We also got the green curry inside the coconut which was a delight!! The veggie spring rolls were good too. Pad Thai was good but not the best hat I've ever eaten. I think their pad Thai has been better in the past.

My husband got the ginger beer which he really
Enjoyed but i felt it had too spicy of a kick that hurts the throat.

I got the fresh pineapple shake which was delicious and very refreshing. 

So the line to get in the restaurant seemed really really long and we waited outside but as soon as we got to the front we were seated immediately. The reservations and waiting in line are the biggest drawback of this place. The line seems to move faster than you can imagine but it can sometimes still be quite a long wait."}
{"text":"After dropping off our things at our Airbnb and a quick Yelp search, we were on our way to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen. 

We ordered two Thai iced teas, shrimp Pad Thai, and shrimp Pad Gra Prow.  The Thai iced tea was perfectly sweet (as it should be), and the shrimp Pad Thai was probably the best Pad Thai dish I have ever had. Ever. I didn't try Howard's Pad Gra Prow, but he killed it and then he killed the rest of my Pad Thai.

The Yelp reviews are truth. Come here. Wait for a bit if you have to. It is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Thai food here was amazing! We ordered a curry and the shrimp appetizer. Both were well made. The portion for the curry was large enough for us to share with 2 bowls of rice. Service was fast and restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Favourite cheap food in Toronto!!! Authentic Thai food, good for portions and incredible price. Is there anything else I can say?"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a great experience. We sat on the patio with Tyler. Would highly recommend starting with the spring roll appetizer and maybe drinking a Singha Beer. The Pad Gra Prow was so delicous!!! I'm sure any of there food would be excellent, though."}
{"text":"The food was good but didn't get the point why there's such a long line up. And we waited soooo long for the food. I feel the waiting kind of offset the good taste of the food. It's worth of going if there's no huge line up and no \"years of waiting\" at the table!"}
{"text":"Literally in LOVE with this place.  If you're looking for a great thai place to eat at, you've come to the right place.  I swung by here a few times and it's always been enjoyable.

First off, the service/atmosphere is great.  They're very friendly and if you've got questions they answer you politely.  Overall the restaurant is clean it's sort of got a bar like feel so it's definitely a social spot.  Just expect a ton of people to be there though, depending on the hours you might have to wait a while if you've got a few people.  If it's just for two you can find yourself a seat in no time.

Secondly, the food.  The appetizers seem pretty standard but I like the sausages, it's different depending on you obviously but it's a personal favourite of mine; nothing like your average sausage from the supermarket obviously but the spices and how it's served with the sauce is delicious.  Getting to main dishes I'd really just pick the curry.  Don't get me wrong everything is good but if you're coming for the first time I'd pick the curry.  There's a ton of options but I end up coming back for the coconut green curry.  I'm very sensitive to spicy food yet curry is still one of my favourite dishes, at PAI you get to pick how spicy you want it to be (I obviously went mild since I'm a wimp with spice) you can choose it to have no spice or REALLY spicy.  The coconut green curry is delightful since your curry literally comes in a coconut, it's fun to scrape out the inside of the coconut while eating the green curry.  The rice surprisingly holds well with the curry and the texture of the curry isn't overly thick but isn't watery either.  It's well balanced and  I end up cleaning up the plate every time.  My friends and I also like the pad thai here too, noodles are cooked perfectly and it's slightly chewy without a good amount of peanuts on there.  

I could rant all day about why I keep coming back but it's really the best thai restaurant that comes closest to matching the food I ate in Thailand."}
{"text":"The sangria pitcher had too much ice in it, which potentially diluted the taste of the sangria as well.  Other than that, I think that this restaurant is deserving of five stars.  The food was very tasteful, especially the fillet (on the menu it is called khao pla tawt).  We also got the egg noodles (khao soi).  Once we began to take bites, it was instantly food heaven.  If it was all-you-can-eat, I would stay there for years without leaving and eat that great fillet.  The waitress was friendly and the wait time was nice and short, but probably because we went a bit earlier than most people go.  We went around 18:00, but even then, it was mostly filled.  The space was very spacious.  Overall, I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"If you like Khao San Road --- this is the same style of food (similar menu, taste, and dishes). I still love the Khao Soi noodles with the sauce - YUMMY! and I'll order their pad thai of course. 
This place definitely feels more \"bar-like\" or maybe even more romantic only cuz its so DARK inside! It seems a lot bigger  (maybe I'm wrong) but it just feels that way because its usually completely full and with a large lineup!"}
{"text":"Apart from the long wait for food, the food was delicious! We got the pad gra prow and the chef unit pad thai and they were generous portions and really tasty."}
{"text":"You have to try this place! This place is one of the best Thai restaurant I ever been too.The food is authentic and delicious, the waiters/waitresses are quick and funny. The portion of the food is not big so my friends and I usually order many dishes and share, work perfectly well for a girl night out!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place. The vibe is super cool, with Whitney Houston and Biggie Smalls playing while you eat. The staff was so nice! We started with the Kung Tawt and Spring rolls. My kids and my husband gobbled it all up. We moved on to the pad Thai with beef and shrimp, then the Pad Graw Prow and I can't remember the other name! But it was a delicious curry. 

We have a lot of Thai restaurants where we live in Southern California and I must say, this place was better than most places back home. 

The waitress was so accommodating, kind and was always checking on us. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Their foods are kinda salty to me .It's crazy busy restaurant in a busy area so it's hard to get a parking spot as well as a table"}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai iced tea, and some fairly tasty entrees. I went twice, but sadly the second time was not as good. The fried rice entree is dry and massive, but the curries are flavorful and worth getting. 
The interior is huge, crowded, and noisy, and the servers both times seemed to be in a rush (can't blame them, but perhaps they could use an extra colleague or two). Service is fairly inattentive, as a result. 
I like the internal waiting area, where they serve you snacks and drinks as you wait for a table to open."}
{"text":"For food alone, this place deserves five stars. Their dishes are large, flavourful, and highly varied. Their chicken Khai Soi is one of the best Thai curries in Toronto. Inside, the place is very crammed, loud, busy, and the service is not able to keep up with demand. Best advice would be to go at more atypical meal times (eg. mid-afternoon) to avoid the madness."}
{"text":"Visited Pai Northern Thai Kitchen for the first time on August 22, 2017 (Tuesday) around 4:30pm with two of my friends. I have never heard of Pai before my friend recommended it, and I am so glad that she did! 

It was located very close to my workplace in the Financial District, so it was very accessible. About a 5-10 minute walk from St. Andrew Station. 

It was surprisingly very busy on a Tuesday late-afternoon! Our party of three was only able to get seats at the bar. Usually, I dislike sitting at the bar, but we were already here so I gave it a shot. 

We ordered the Grabong for $13 to split. Grabong is freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts. It was amazing - I highly recommend! The portion was also very large that all three of us had more than enough to get our fill of the dish. The bartender/waitress was also very accommodating as she gave us another dipping sauce to make it easier for us. 

For my main course, I ordered the Khao Soi with Braised Beef. It cost $15.5. I never had Khao Soi before, so there is really nothing I can compare it to... but it was to die for. The sauce was great, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the braised beef was so tender. It was a very big portion so I couldn't finish all the curry and the beef, but I savored every bite and tried to eat as much as I could. 

All in all, I would 100% come back and would recommend everyone to try this restaurant out at some point! 

The only thing I could recommend for them to improve is to increase the size of the restaurant and let more people enjoy your food!!!! Around 5:30 there was already such a long line of people waiting to get seated!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, atmosphere is pleasant, kinda of got a weird vibe but it's a good weird

Food was absolutely delicious and it's definitely a busy restaurant so show up early  

Service was good, they made some mistakes by forgetting our appetizer but it wasn't the end of the world"}
{"text":"Whenever anyone asks for my favorite thai restaurant in the heart of downtown, I will 100% recommend Pai! The food is 100% authentic and delicious, the atmosphere is amazing and the staff is wonderful. The wait time for Pai is really long, so I do recommend reservations."}
{"text":"When you go to pour your water, and the bottle starts tweeting like a bird, that's enough to make you feel like \"damn, I'm coming back here for sure\".

The food is loaded with flavour, and the presentation seems to be quite authentic - trust me, I've watched YouTube videos of Thailand, plus I've travelled there via Google Maps Street View, so I'm legit.

Try everything.

4/5"}
{"text":"Ever since I came back from Thailand, I've been looking for a good Khao Soi soup but unfortunately everything paled in comparison to what I had over there...But I'm so happy to say that the one at Pai Thailand comes pretty darn close!! Unfortunately...or fortunately..I don't live in Toronto, or else I would be there quite often. It is a pretty rich soup but so worth it! Def add the marinated veggies, it takes the soup to a whole other level. I wish they gave more though. Next time I'm in town, I will def try the green curry dish as well!"}
{"text":"We came to Pai for dinner. There's usually a wait to get a table. I'd recommend coming earlier to put your name down. 

I ordered the Gaeng Hung Lai (ox tail) and the Sai Va Platter. The oxtail curry is pretty sweet. There's a lot of bones and the meat is quite tender off the bone. It was a pretty solid dish. 

I didn't like the sai va platter. It was a bit bland, but is okay for sharing. I wouldn't recommend ordering it.

I still would prefer the green curry with chicken. I ended up getting this because my friend couldn't handle the spice she ordered. This is the best and most consistent dish here in my opinion. I'd also recommend ordering the Thai ice tea. In my opinion these are the best two things at Pai. It's better than suko. I'd definitely return to try the khao soi."}
{"text":"I came here after a friend recommended it to me. I was in Toronto on vacation and wanted to eat the best food Toronto had to offer, Pai definitely didn't disappoint! We tried to come here twice, the first night the wait was almost an hour so we left and decided to come back early the next day. Boy was it worth it! The crispy pork is one of the best I've ever had and all the dishes we ordered were so good that we had to finish everything. I'm extremely sad that I don't live in Toronto and can't come here all the time."}
{"text":"Best Thai joint downtown. Ton of variety. My favourite dishes would be the pad thai and the khao soi - very smooth and rich. I came here for my friends birthday, you are able to book big groups however you must book in advance. Great atmosphere, even has a TV in the private rooms. Definitely a must try thai place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

My cousin rented out a room at the back for her birthday dinner.  Upon entering, I noticed that this place was jam-packed and noisy.  Nevertheless, I soon acclimatized to the aforementioned noise pollution and attributed it to the bountiful liquor and positive vibes in this place.

I ordered the Gaeng Kiaw Wan which is \"Green Curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk. Served in a coconut!\" w/ Chicken.  I pretty much ordered it because it was served in a coconut (gimmicks ftw).  It turned out to be super delicious, but the portion was fairly small.  Also, the coconut is legit - you can scrape the coconut jelly off the inside and eat it too.

A downside to the experience was that they couldn't give us separate bills, and so there was about 20 of us trying to pool bills and coins tgh."}
{"text":"Can I just tell you that I love this place. I've only been here once, but I can tell that this place is popular, so we had to wait for a table - this was around lunch time.  I really liked the atmosphere, which was relaxed and they played 90's rap and r&b hits that day (good times!) I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork and it was absolutely delish.  I wouldn't change anything about that dish.  Our server was also great, she came by frequently to make sure we were good. If you don't mind the music and crowd, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and this place never disappoints! Well, aside from the occasional long wait to get a table because it can get pretty full in here... Make sure to reserve your seats ahead of time. 

The atmosphere is so hip and relaxed. Prices and portions are fair. They really try to give you a nice little Thailand feel with the restaurant's neat decor. The coasters for drinks even have elephants on them. So cute. I always order the Chicken Pad Thai because it's my favourite! I absolutely love Thai food and tend to order a Pad Thai wherever I can, and I have to say Pai is one of the best places to get it in Toronto. Lots of flavour that just hits the spot! 

Came here again the other day just to eat and drink with some friends. The food was on point and tasted amazing as usual. We ordered about 7 rounds of soju bombs for the 3 of us (lol)! It comes in a set of 4 shots for $16 - pretty good deal, and didn't taste so bad either. We all had a good time! 

I would DEFINITELY recommend this restaurant if you're into Thai food."}
{"text":"Had a mild pad gra prow with egg for lunch, good portion and balance between rice and toppings. Their food definitely tasted different than other Thai food that I've tried previously. Will come back for more! 

Not a 5 star rating because music is too loud, I am a soft speaker and I had to try really hard to speak up that my throat hurts after; and it's not accessible for people in wheelchairs using the front entrance, there's a flight of stairs that you need to get down."}
{"text":"when i walked in smelt good. pad tai was good. closed to transit too. need more space to sit down. cramped but enjoyed it"}
{"text":"The taste is good.  The portion is ok.  Nothing fancy, ordinary Thai food like rice and noodles.  Not traditional Thai food, more like a Thai fast food with Bar service.  Located in a basement.  It's good because it's in Toronto downtown.  If you have been to Thailand.  it's not authentic Thai food.  No lemon fish, no shrimp cake, no stir fry vege with shrimp sauce, etc.  Overpriced."}
{"text":"Perfect Thai Curry in nice easy going atmosphere, portions are reasonable, great service, not really any desserts available."}
{"text":"I feel like most people who gave Pai amazing ratings came where there wasn't as HUGE of a lineup. Was the food great? Yes, it was really delicious - more to come later in the review. Was the service good when we sat at the tables? Yes I would say it was standard! Why three stars then, you might ask? WELL, the story goes:

We came here for a weekday dinner on a very cold Toronto night, and let me tell you, the lineup to put our names down took 30 minutes. Yes, there was a line that went ALL around the staircase, and yes, there was a lot of awkwardness with us and other first-timers wanting to get a number and realizing that we had to lineup AROUND the whole staircase to get a number. No, no, we're not  trying to bud in line, it's just that I've never seen a host take THAT long to take people's names down. Literally, all we were asked is \"How many people in your party? What's your name? It will be an X minute wait, okay?\" THREE QUESTIONS, and it took them 5 minutes to ask those questions cause the servers had to discuss a table problem with the host. I really hope the organization of Pai steps up. I really don't mind waiting for an hour for a table, but to wait 30 minutes to put down our names when there were roughly 10 parties in front of us waiting to put their names down is a little TOO long.

Loved the little waiting area for people especially when the weather is so cold! When you're waiting, you're able to order some drinks and when you're buzzer rings, you're ready to go! If they really wanted to fit tables in this room, I think they could put maybe 10-15 parties of 2-4 in here, but it's also a good idea for people to have a space to wait. 

Since one of our friends came here before, we knew EXACTLY what to order. There are five levels of spice for the mains you can order, ranging from no spice at all to Thai level spicy! We ordered the Grabong, Chef Nuit Pad Thai, Gaeng Masaman with braised beef, and Pad Gra Prow. 

To start off for drinks, we got heir Thai ice tea ($5.50) which was REALLY good. Despite the large amount of ice in here, the taste was really good until the ice started melting. 

Grabong ($13) - Description: Freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts. (contains eggs and peanuts)
This was honestly one of my favourites! These squash fritters were delicious - you really have to eat a few in one bite!!! They're much tastier than sweet potato fries in my opinion, but if I had to compare them to something, it would be like thinly cut sweet potato fries, made into a fritter with some scrumptious sauce for dipping. 

Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($15.50) - Description: Stir fried rice noodle in a home made tamarind sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. Choice of Chicken, Beef or tofu and veggies. (contains oyster sauce).
This pad thai was good, but it wasn't like a DROP DEAD amazing kind of good. They did pretty well in making the levels of spiciness though as five very different levels!

Gaeng Masaman with braised beef ($15) - Description: Braised beef in a peanut, tamarind curry with potatoes and topped with deep fried crispy shallots. (contains shrimp paste) Served with steamed jasmine rice.
This dish tasted fairly delicious too. I wasn't a big fan of the braised beef, it wasn't as tender as I wanted it to be, but it wasn't necessarily chewy either. The sauce was good, but it also wasn't my top pick!

Pad Gra Prow ($15.50) - Description: Holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground Pork, Chicken, Beef or Tofu served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. (contains oyster sauce) Served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime)
This might have been my faourite dish. Except I wish they gave MORE RICE. We ordered an extra bowl of rice cause the sauce was THAT good. I wish I can bring the secret recipe for this dish home."}
{"text":"Good. Mushroom not my thing as I seek out more dense vegan protein. However, this was pretty darn good. I would say closer to a 4 star than three but a bit too much oil. Again, good though. The servers were outstanding and very nice with smiles."}
{"text":"The food at this place was very good! I came here with my boyfriend and his group of friends for dinner. The place was packed with people, it was a good thing we had a reservation. The location of this restaurant is also very convenient in downtown. The seating in this place was kind of cramped. The atmosphere at this restaurant is not the typical Thai restaurant - it is more hip in their appeal. It is like a cross between a bar and a Thai restaurant. The food here is very good. The curries were very well done. The service was good. There is also some interesting drink choices. I ordered the Ginger Beer - which I highly recommend if you like ginger. It is so good! Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food even though the seating at times got a bit tight."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the architecture inside is very unique. It really feeling you station in Thailand. The taste was real Thai foods."}
{"text":"Super busy as always. Still my fav Thai place in the Dt core. But unfortunately they increased the price again"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is pretty eclectic in my opinion; the decorations seemed close to what you would see in a restaurant in Thailand (I'd assume, since I've never been to Thailand), and the mismatched chairs added to the appeal. They also have a cool table where there are floor cushions to sit on rather than chairs! There is also a small patio (maybe 8-12 seats). 

Although we (party of 4) were seated fairly quickly, it took a while for the servers to come ask us for our drinks and orders. Additionally, the waiters never checked up on us during the meal or offered to refill our water. I can understand not doing so when the restaurant is crazy busy, but at 2:00 on a Thursday, the restaurant wasn't too chaotic. Perhaps they were understaffed. Food also took a while to come out. 

I had the chicken pad thai (mild) and I tried a bit of the panang beef curry. While the pad thai wasn't overly saucy and the noodles had a good texture, I felt that the chicken was a bit dry, and the sauce not sour enough for my liking. Portion size was good; I was full but not bursting. The bit of panang beef that I tried was flavourful and thick, albeit, a bit too salty. 

TLDR; I would come back if I'm in the area and have a hankering for Thai, but I doubt I'd make a special trip here."}
{"text":"We got the spring rolls and the fried squash to start and it was good. Lots of flavour and the dipping sauces were great. We also go the Thai Bucket drink which didn't have much alcohol considering it costs $27. Most of us got the pad Thai because of the great reviews. Unfortunately it wasn't what we expected. We all thought it was too sweet for our liking. Although we did like the pad Thai it did not meet our expectations. Most likely won't go back considering all the other Thai options I the city."}
{"text":"Pai is our go-to Thai restaurant close to the Financial district.  I have never been disappointed with a meal here.  The beef in the Khao soi and the masaman curries is always tender and flavourful.  The pad Thai is great as it's not too sweet.  I usually come at lunch with co-workers and we share medium spicy dishes. This week I went for dinner with a couple of friends and I had my own dish of the masaman beef curry which I ordered \"foreigner spicy\".  It was so good.  Very spicy; enough to make me sweat and so flavourful.   It is almost always busy here so try to make a reservation before coming or come at an off peak time.  You will not regret eating at Pai!"}
{"text":"Tip:-
Utter disappointment-I went by the ratings and didn't read Barbara or Stephanie's reviews-Below average Thai food I guess I have had better.No flavor no kick in the taste?"}
{"text":"Not exactly sure what the hype was about.  The restaurant really feels more like a bar that serves food than a serious Thai place.  On a Monday night the place was full of hipsters and millennials which in and of itself isn't bad as long the food is up to snuff.  

Looking at the menu I was really looking forward to the Tom yum soup but it was way too over powering on the lemongrass and spice for my liking so by comparison the thai wings seemed a bit bland.  My entree rice dish, the name escapes me now, was average and not very memorable.  I think the reason why it has such a high number of reviews is because it caters to said millennial crowd who perhaps hasn't had too many life experiences to know that this is grossly over priced.

Find a Thai place in an ethnic neighborhood instead.  You'll pay half as much for something twice as good."}
{"text":"My second experience at Pai was great on a few fronts.  This place is quite popular on weekdays and weekends so for big groups, a reservation is a must.  By the time our group of 10 left, there was a line up the stairs and just at the door.

The service staff were friendly and swift with taking our orders and the kitchen staff was just as quick to bring the food to our table all at the same time.  :-)

I like the street market atmosphere that they are trying to bring to the space in the restaurant.

My favourite points of the meal were:

1. the deep-fried squash fritters (the grabong) were crunchy and lightly fried and also tasted sweet like a sweet potato.  It was great even without the garlic tamarind dip which provides some more savoury flavours.

2. this was the first time I had khao soi and I think I will want to come back to have more in the future.  The noodles had the right bite to hold up against the spicy and creaminess of golden curry.  Bonus: ask for a container to bring the soup home if you want to enjoy it with some rice for lunch the next day!

3. the thai milk ice tea is preferred over the lemongrass ice tea since the lemongrass is so subtle that I could barely detect it next to the stronger flavour of the thai milk ice tea.

Only small issue is the lack of coat hooks for the larger tables that use stools instead of chairs.  There is no convenient hook or coat stand nearby for guests at those tables.

Till next time."}
{"text":"We went here based solely on Yelp reviews. I was in Toronto with my son looking at Universities and given the fabulous choices that Toronto has to offer, we weren't stuck for choice. We came on a weekday around 5:30, and there was a short 15 minute wait. I got a fabulous frozen cocktail that was served in a pineapple; delish! So good I had to have another .  The vibe was young and hip and there was a great atmosphere. The food was every bit as good as everyone said; my son's pad Thai was super fresh and flavorful, with the right hint of lime. My noodle dish was so good; served in a bowl and kind of a cross between a soup and a dish... You could tell the ingredients were fresh and good quality. If I lived anywhere near this place I would be there all the time!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience as if we are in a Thai shack! The food is on point. they have fun twists on Moscow mule which are nice drinks. Drinks are in the $10-13 range. Food is delicious as well. Service was fairly good too. Overall, quite happy with our experience. Note that this was midday on a weekday and the restaurant was fairly empty. Bathrooms are clean enough."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Thai food that I've ever eaten in Toronto!!! The taste of the food is exactly the same as the one I tried in Thailand few months ago! I personally love spicy and sour food very much so I love the food they serve here. I love this Thai restaurant and I'll definitely come again ;)  If you are craving for the traditional Thai food, this is the place that you definitely don't want to miss !"}
{"text":"Seriously my favourite Thai food. We enjoyed delicious spring rolls, chicken pad Thai and beef curry. Everything was fantastic! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered food to go from here and we thought it would be much better than it was reading previous reviews on Yelp
First let me tell you my husband is half Thai and we are used to eating authentic Thai food-
We ordered the vegetable pad Thai-which was sweet, not spicy (we ordered medium) and the noodles were clumped together. There was hardly any vegetables in it, 2 pieces of broccoli and 3 pieces of cauliflower and some carrots. 
Tom yum soup- also kinda sweet. We are used to a more clear broth when lemongrass and more spices
Green curry-my husband said was okay
Pad Gra Prow with tofu-this is something similar to stir fried basil and it had literally no sauce or flavor aside from the tofu. No vegetables in it, basically a bed of jasmine rice with tofu and some basil. Totally not impressed. I don't get what all the hype is about. 
We've ordered to go food from plenty of Thai restaurants and not had issues like this. 
I gave it 3 stars because it was super convenient  that they deliver food.  
Would not recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one weekday. Underground, and really hip. Chalkboard menus, artworks on exposed brick walls in dim lightning and loud upbeat music. There are bar stools, tables or a low table where you sit on the floor with cushions.

The greeter and waiters are super friendly and hipster. We ordered the tom yum appetizer and beef pad thai. Pad thai was alright, such a large dish for $12, could be 3 of my meals but i'm a small eater. Tom yum was spicy and a little sour. There was two small wedges of tomatoes and one button mushroom cut in 4 slices. I forgot to tell them not to put coriander because I don't like it. There was also 2 shrimps and a couple of slices of onions. I didn't drink the soup because it was ridiculously SALTY.

Unique things about this restaurant is that the water jug makes a bird chirp when it pours. I'm not sure whether that's intentional or not. Also, the menu is hand drawn on a piece of regular white paper.

Food was alright and so was service. Really neat environment and quite trendy."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and stumbled upon this place through yelp! The food was AMAZING. The drinks were delicious and everyone was so kind and welcoming. The service was the icing on the cake to an amazing experience. I tried the starter Tom yum soup and it was the best I've ever had!! My only regret was not having enough room for the mango sticky rice because it looked SO good. Definitely recommend on a nice chilly day for some amazing comforting Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food, server was pushy though.. She kept coming back to ask if we were done with our food.. And there wasn't even a lineup."}
{"text":"Situated in a nice area in Toronto, I'm a fan of Pai for its great food.

I particularly love the pad thai and the good thing is that it's priced well, too. I could literally go there and have the pad thai and call it a great day.

I wish there are better accessible entrances as the place is in a basement. If there are elevators there, I have yet to find them.

Over-all, Pai is a solid Thai place with a very satisfying pad thai."}
{"text":"It's not even a debate for me. The best Thai I have ever had in my life! 

Fantastic!

It's not even a marginal difference... it's substantial. 

I seriously don't know what the other Thai food places are doing, but they need to figure out what these people do and replicate."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Pad Thai. They can make almost any order vegan, which was a really nice option! My boyfriend had the Khao Soi with beef and said it was too heavy and left him feeling very bloated after. It has a really fun vibe, nice music playing, and a nice bar. Good prices."}
{"text":"decent food and servers were nice...music is old-school hip hop (which I liked)

uncomfortable chairs for a big table and automatic 20% gratuity added for tables over 6? hmm...this place isn't high-end, so i thought that was excessive ...for this place...I would have tipped the standard 15%, but to each his own"}
{"text":"Not sure what more I could add about the food (which is awesome), but I noticed one interesting fact while I ate here Saturday night. Every employee seemed to enjoy working at Pai Northern, and they're all very courteous.  That tells me a lot about the integrity of the establishment.  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! So far the best one I tried in Toronto. Khao Soi chicken is my favorite dish. Tom Yum soup is one the best... Make sure to try it."}
{"text":"Definitely make a reservation, this place gets super booked up. When I came an hour before closing there was a 45 min wait. Thankfully they were seating on the stage (aka floor seating) and I got sat immediately. I tried the green curry which comes presented in a small coconut. It was okay, not my favourite. My favourite dish was the Tom yum soup, super flavourful. I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes, some sound really authentic. Service is super fast and nice!"}
{"text":"Food is heaven!!  I'm giving it a 5 star because the food tastes amazing, and staff are friendly and try their best to attend to their tables."}
{"text":"I thought I had eaten authentic Thai in until now. This was by far the best tasting Pad Thai I've had in Toronto. I had the vegetarian option and it was super tasty. I didn't feel it even need to have chicken or shrimp. It was perfect. The ambiance was also friendly and chill and relaxed yet not boring. Busy but not annoyingly so. A popular spot for good reason. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Difficult to get a table here, great underground place, just in downtown Toronto, atmosphere is so cool, nice music, good service.. but the food is to die for! Love it"}
{"text":"Excellent and casual, fun Thai spot. Very busy though, food is very good for the most part.

The coconut soup comes served in an actual hollowed out coconut, that's impressive!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here with a friends recommendation for a yummy Thai restaurant. I had to wait past the busy dinner time (9pm) to be able to talk to someone on the phone (otherwise it's a voicemail) to make a reservation. 

My friend and I were there first and were served water and we were able to order drinks (Thai Iced Tea, really good) while we waited for the rest of the party to come. By this time it was just starting to get busy with the dinner rush, but it never got ridiculously loud that we weren't able to talk comfortably. When the rest came, drinks were ordered and my friend who does not like drinking sugary drinks was able to order a mango shake no sugar. 

We were never rushed to order but our waitress came in to check on us and make sure our water was full. I ordered the Khao Soi, the others ordered: Pork belly Gaeng Hunglay, and the others ordered the Pad Thai. I found my dish quite heavy to say, I am more used to eating curry with rice so eating noodles got a bit messy. Would I order this again? Yes, but maybe switch for rice. My friends enjoyed their dish and it was all very yummy.

We stayed a bit longer then usual, but they never seemed bothered or annoyed that we were staying after paying for the bill. In fact, they made sure we had water refilled. I love when restaurants don't feel the need to kick customers out, we were catching up and were having a great time.

Overall, great customer service & great food."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place for a group to eat at on a Saturday, and was so glad to stumble upon Pai! The location is really nice, very convenient if you're downtown. It is a very busy place, but they do have a room in the back with communal table, which is where we ended up. The service was really good, and the food was very flavourful. I got a curry with braised beef, which was very good. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was truly the highlight of my Toronto trip. Having been to Thailand, I can honestly say that this has been one of the best places I've been to outside of Thailand. I am Gluten intolerant and I had no issues ordering from this place as most items are Gluten free. I had the Pad thai, Green curry, and chicken satay and each dish was 5 stars. I give this place an overall 4 though because I wish they had a bigger menu like other thai restaurants. However, do not let this keep you from trying this spot!! Its amazing!"}
{"text":"my party and i arrived hungry after escaping from the terminal island, we sought after libations and refreshments for our famished stomaches..

we walked cautiously underground and placed our names down for a number...

\"an hour wait\" the door goblin said. We've faced worst hungers before and we're not backing down...

so we waited, half a moon past, the bellows of our hungering stomach echoed throughout the underground cavern....there must be something we can do, thought Da Vid, our rogue..

Using his powers of trickery and deception, Vid negotiated with his tongue and our party was magically bumped to the next in line

i asked for the chicken pad thai, a classic staple in goblin thai cuisine. The dish arrives, i also ordered a sake for my thirsty throat

everything was great, the food was satisfying and the drink quenched my thirst. We never saw the service goblin after placing our order and delivering our refreshments...but then again, i do not expect much on a busy night

after placing a bag full of coins down to pay for the meal, our party walks out ready for our next adventure. Vid was already exhausted from previous exploits at terminal island was desperately seeking shelter by the riverbanks of mississauga"}
{"text":"We started with two apps: the port skewers which were tasty, and the beef salad which is supposed to be seasoned with chili lime but instead was overpowered with hot chillies leaving any lime flavor not tasteable. For our mains my girlfriend had a shrimp basil stir fry which was tasty. I had the massaman curry with braised beef. Again the dish was overpowered by spice so strong I couldn't taste the flavor. Keep in mind this is coming from someone who loves spicy food."}
{"text":"Love this place a lot. I been here few time and every time, tried a lot of Thai food that I haven't try before. All my friends love this place now . We will come back"}
{"text":"Delicious food and cozy atmosphere.  Went for both lunch and dinner for different occasions.  Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants outside of Thailand ever! Their standout dish is the Massaman Curry which is succulent, spicy and everything nice. They have a ridiculous waiting time at night so best to go there for lunch at an off-peak hour (after 2 pm). The decor is tantalizingly quirky and I was transported to a street-side Thai eatery immediately."}
{"text":"Despite the 45-minute wait for a table due to how busy Pai can get, the experience was definitely worth it with delicious food and great drinks.

The Pad Thai was stellar (FYI: medium level of spicy is bearable and enjoyable for someone who doesn't usually eat food that's too spicy)

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My group was lucky to have booked for a table of 8. We had made reservations almost a month before and we're pleasantly surprised. Why you ask?

First, we swiftly seated in the hidden private room when we arrived. The main area of the restaurant was bustling and then I entered the private party room where you can fit around 20 ppl. The other group didn't arrive yet so the first part of the dinner felt like we were in an exclusive restaurant.

A few of us ordered drinks that many thought were unique especially the spiked thai tea. Now on to the food.  It was a treat with lots of choices as we ended up sharing dishes to thoroughly enjoy what Pai had to offer. I normally do not like spicy but the level of spiciness was just right.

The dish that I enjoyed the most was the Khao Soi which was noodles with braised beef. The whole night was not rushed and they were so accommodating to serve us the cake that was brought from outside. Definitely will return but will need to book ahead again."}
{"text":"This is a warm & cozy buzzing, basement level restaurant, with a cocktail
menu so delicious that you'll wish they were open past 10:30pm.

The food is generously portioned, delicious, and reasonably priced. Be prepared to wait for a table, they have a side room with benches and tables.  

My companion had a veggie Thai meal that was served in a carved coconut.
 I was thrilled with the amazing rice noodle beef soup.  Our cocktails (a plum wine mule and a cool sake were excellent.
Definitely want to return.  Staff was incredibly friendly, welcoming, and have a rule to never rush folks out at closing time.  Photos below."}
{"text":"We finally got to try Pai after reading lots of good review on it. We had high expectation came in and we definitely weren't disappointed. The portion was decent, 3 people ordered 2 main dishes and 1 salad appetizer, we were all very full after. The sangria was also delicious! We really enjoyed the pad Thai and the green coconut curry! Highly recommended ! 

Another tip: try to get there as early as they open for the day to avoid long waits."}
{"text":"Such a cozy little restaurant in the heart of downtown. The food is great, and I've always had really friendly service with the waiters/waitresses always ready to help.

This restaurant gets booked up fast so either be ready to wait in line or make a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"Terrific food, impeccable service.
Was able to walk in on a weeknight (2 of us) and sit at the bar, which I'm sure is rare seeing how the crowds rolled in after us. 

The wait staff looked happy to be there and were helpful in selecting a dish. 

We ordered the squash fries and the beef Kao Soi noodles which was sooooo delectable . (If we were hungry enough we would have ordered a side of rice and poured the rest of the  sweet coconut curry broth over it). Instead we soaked our fries in it. I can't handle much spice, so this dish was just perfect. 

Portions were generous, taste was wonderful, and service was great. Nothing not to like (although you should make a reservation)."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with unique tasty food. I'm always for the hunt for something different, and by now, pad thai etc is normal fair to me. 

Enter Pai, with their unique (to me) fare. We ordered several appetizers to share and one main. 

Miang Kung- different ingredients that you put together in betel leaves.  Very tasty and light with the right amount of spice. Everything works well together (shrimp and pomelo, what???)

Som Tum Tad- green papaya saladwith salted crab. To be honest, I just wanted to see what a salted crab was. I think if you're not Asian or are not used to \"different\" foods you would not enjoy this much. But then why would you come here, right? Interesting, and again had the right level of taste, but I wouldn't get it again

Plah Nua - beef salad. GET IT CUZ IT'S SO SO GOOD. I don't even like mint leaves and I gobbled this up. Beef cooked to perfect level for this dish and lots of it, more than I expected. 

Khao Soi - egg noodles in coconut curry with chicken drumsticks. Order an extra bowl of rice so that delicious delicious curry doesn't go to waste. Or take it home and enjoy the next day. 

Thai iced tea - nice size, a little bit sweeter than I like it but I let the ice melt a bit and it was fine after that. 

Prices are very decent in comparison to other Thai restaurants. The ratio of actual food to sauce is higher than normal which is a big win for me since I hate going to places that use filler vegetables (green peppers) and little meat in their dishes. You can tell that a lot of thought and care went into preparing the planning of their menu. 
I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to try other items!"}
{"text":"Came here because I had heard this restaurant was opened up by the original chefs of KSR.  Was not disappointed. Very happy for them!

Very busy so make a reservation. Lovely ambiance. Exceptional Thai in the city."}
{"text":"Great food, (I recommend the pad Thai!) drinks are a little sweet and service is slow."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! The best Thai food I ever had! 
This place is a must go for everyone (Torontorians or if you are visiting). The food is from heaven!!!
Ordered plum mule for drinks ! Surprised! Exotic is the best work to explain it.
For food appetizer we ordered the Kung Tawt (fried shrimp) which was good. Main dish, Gaeng Klaw was in coconut with chicken and Khao Soi with beef! 
The best food I had for a while I can even say the best food I had in Toronto!
Will definitely come back (looking forward to next time here!).
khao soi with beef is on my list as my last meal!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and place! It is gets a bit fill and noise but food flavors are just really great"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time since this place was know for the best Thai in Toronto. However, we will feel like it was a little too hyped. The wait was almost 1 hour when we arrived. The servers were alright not great. The host was super nice. They send you a text when your table is ready. The food was a lot smaller than what we expected. We didn't think it was worth much of the price. However, it was still decent. Thai tea was a little too sweet. Fried chicken was only 3 pieces per order which was also alright. The pad Thai and coconut dish was good but too little. Kai Soi was a little salty but braised beef was tender."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable pricing. If you're OK to sit in a section that doesn't have liquor license, you can get a table right away."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 star for me; not exactly at the same level as my other 4stars. The food was good and we had a good time.

Food: 3.5/5, I got the green curry in a coconut. It was tasty but ridiculously hard to eat. It was a creative way to try but not very functional.  The squash fritters were delicious and highly recommended.

Service: 3/5, super nice people working here and a bit of over-service when it gets to almost every 10-15mins to check in on us and they were really eager to take our plates when we weren't finished. But it's not the end of the world

Ambience: 3/5, nice little place, a bit dark and loud so not perfect for conversations bit good for short stays

Price: 2/5, a little overpriced for what it is $25 per person but I will return to try something else for sure"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've ever had. There will definitely be a wait, but the food is worth it. They also have great mixed drinks, beer and wine. Must go!"}
{"text":"Review is only for their Pad Thai.  

Only gotten take-out during lunch.  Small portion for what you pay ($13.50 plus tax during lunch).  Pad Thai is pretty cheap to make so they can at least fill up the take-out container.  It's pretty tasty though and comparable to the other Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto like Khao San Road and Sukho Thai.

Also tried the Moo Grub (crispy pork).  Very crispy indeed and tasty.  Could use some dipping sauce to enhance it.

It's hard to find good Pad Thai in the city hence why I returned to Pai a few times already but I'll admit that it hurts paying $15.00 for it since the cost of ingredients aren't expensive.  It is what it is.  I hate how Thai food is priced and how it's regarded as \"fancy\" but really, it's very similar to Chinese and Vietnamese food.  It should not be this expensive.

P.S. Shoutout to Thai Bistro (now closed) for their Pad Thai.  It was under $13.00 for a Beef Pad Thai WITH Tofu and it filled up the entire take-out container.  That was IMO the best Pad Thai in Toronto.  Hope the owner Jack and his family are doing alright since it closed..."}
{"text":"Honestly wasn't that impressed. Food was decent but definitely not worth the wait. I'd prefer a more traditional thai menu versus a fusion style menu; there just weren't enough good choices and I felt kind of handcuffed. There was also no option to make my dish extra spicy...I had to get chili paste. The bartender had to get his manager to make a gin martini for me and the service was pretty slow."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food that I've ever had. Pai turned my boyfriend onto Thai food being this was his first time having Thai. Tucked into neighborhood in downtown Toronto it was well worth the wait. Even though it was a longer wait the service was really quick when we did get seated.  I always come here anytime I'm visiting Toronto !"}
{"text":"So much yums in one meal! 
He took me here when he heard I've never been because apparently it's one of the gems in the city, & to be honest, I've never been to a thai restaurant.. I know, I know.. shocker! 

The place is underground and it's cute as hell. Decor reminds me of going away to thailand or some exotic place. Dim lights, romantic setting.. it was perf. Definitely a perfect place to bring your ladies, gentlemen! We didn't make a reservation (oops lol) and we ended up having to wait an hour but it didn't matter because we just walked around the area.. I'd say it was worth the wait! They text you when your table is ready and you have 5 minutes, so don't walk away too fast. 

They have options that can be made vegan, which he made sure for me before he picked the place. So awesome. I had the green curry vegan dish (tofu/veggies) and it was served inside a young coconut, which I loved. The aesthetic was real. With the jasmine rice, it was perf. He had some other rice dish.. honestly I can't recall because I was so fixated on my own deal. It had a fried egg on it though.. and he finished it all, so clearly it was good. Huge portions! 
Service was quick and friendly, which is always appreciated.

Pai, you are the apple of my eye."}
{"text":"A very popular place. You need to make reservations ahead of time. It's hard to call them. You are better off with dropping by a few days ahead to make reservations. Best Thai food yet in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place, reservations make it easy to book unlike Khao San Road which is not saying anything about their delicious menu options.

Came here with the bf and ordered a pad thai and khao soi curry. We practically licked the plates and bowls they came on. I've been craving for authentic thai and he's never had much outside of canadian thai so I was glad Pai delivered for both of us!

I really want to go back to try their coconut curry! 

We had a beer and sake which was good and fairly priced. The service was a little absent, took us forever to get her to take our order, give us water (pad thai was nice and spicy) and give us our bill. So the 1 star is for that. 

Love the atmosphere but wish the tables weren't so squished together that i had to turn sideways to sit down. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was freaking amazing! From the courtesy of the hostess and servers. This place was one I loved. The art was so awesome, nostalgia for old school music with the albums hanging on the wall to the way the lights dangled overhead. Two dining areas and you are still looking at a 35min wait but trust me it was worth it!! Make your way here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a dish at this place that I didn't absolutely love!  I've been to A LOT of thai restaurants and this is definitely the best!  Service and decor is great too!  Very busy though so get there early or make a reservation VERY EARLY!  It gets booked up many days in advance."}
{"text":"We reached at 6 and added our names to their list. The wait time was an hour, so we left our contact number and went to a nearby place to grab drinks. We were seated within an hour and 20 mins. 
The ambiance and spirit of the place is cosy yet buzzing. It was super crowded yet everyone looked comfortable. 
We were told we may have to opt for communal eating and share our table but thankfully we ended up getting our own table. 
We placed our order based on reviews on Yelp. We ordered their Green Curry (Gaeng Kiaw Wan) and Khao Soi which had egg noodles with curry, crispy noodles and your choice of meat. We had the Green Curry with Chicken and it's served in a coconut and the Khao Soi with Beef.
The service was friendly and efficient. Our food came within 20 mins of ordering. The Thai Iced Tea complemented the food perfectly. 
Overall we had a great experience and I would definitely recommend this place!! It's definitely worth the wait and justifies the hype."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite places to go for Thai food in the city!  Great food and knowledgeable staff.  Always a big line up, but the space is pretty big and the line moves fast.  Make a reso in advance if you can!"}
{"text":"Famous Thai restaurant in Toronto. It's one of the best one in Toronto. Compared to other good Thai restaurants worldwide, it's not just standard, but in Toronto, no doubt. Foods are great, but price is a bit high. Satisfied anyways."}
{"text":"Amazing find in Toronto! 

Sat at the bar and ordered a few beers while enjoying curry, noodles, fried shrimp, chicken skewers and the best sticky rice with mango I've ever had! 

Note: this place gets packed around 6pm. Make reservations or arrive prior to 5:30 to get a seat. 

Another note: part of the restaurant does not have an alcohol license so depending on your plans for the night, it may be faster to sit there!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a place that has 1500+ 5star reviews. We came here after a friend who is local here recommended it. We stopped by on a Friday afternoon for lunch and it was pretty crowded. You can order drinks and appetizers while you are waiting though which is great and made the wait painless.

We ordered the eggrolls while we were waiting and to be honest I never thought I would write a review for an eggroll. This eggroll was definitely the best I have had so far; we liked it so much that we ordered a second plate of the appetizer. In addition, we got Penang curry and fried rice and both were great as well. 

Staff were super friendly and service was good.They don't do same day reservations though, so plan ahead because it does get super crowded."}
{"text":"Great egg rolls and Thai beer. Food was also very delicious. Definitely worth the long wait."}
{"text":"Long wait, the curry while it wasn't bad, wasn't as good as people hype it up to be and they messed up my spice level."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, 2 for dinner and 1 for lunch. The 2 times I came here for dinner was amazing. Their Pad Thai is so good, I can't stop thinking about it. However, I came here for lunch once and it was very disappointing. The noodles were all clumped together, no flavour, I guess maybe it was just that day. I'll definitely give it one more try though."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday evening in October with friends before we saw a movie at the TIFF after dark festival. I was with 2 guys, one came later than we had planned so we waiting for him to order.  I ordered the fried fish (with rice and 2 sauces) and the sweet potato tempura. Both came quickly and were extremely delicious. 
Some things I would improve: 
-the initial service (when ordering drinks) they asked us 6 times in 15 min. 
-when we ordered drinks it took them that same about of time to bring it 

Other than that I liked the atmosphere and the vibe. Would def go back."}
{"text":"Really busy last night. Remember to call for reservation. Waited 45 minutes to get seated for 3 people. But the food was really good!! Worth the wait!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Amazing and flavorful food. Beautifully presented. Just an overall win. Brisk service. Do yourself a favor and eat here !"}
{"text":"A very popular Thai restaurant in Toronto and a new favorite of mine. Went on a Friday night to enjoy dinner and boy this place gets packed very quickly. Luckily my friend made reservations because the line for walk-ins was so long, it went out the door. I like the atmosphere inside as it gives off a very rustic Asian restaurant you would find in Taiwan. They have a good selection of dishes on their menu. I ordered the Thai Ice Tea (a must whenever you go for Thai food) and the Khao Soi with the Chicken. It was a pretty delicious dish with a flavorful curry that was not overpowering. The noodles and chicken were great along with the fried noodles. Overall, great dining place for Thai food and I will be back. Friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to others and my suggestion is to always make reservations so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I get the hype! I got take-out so maybe its all about the location and ambiance (which to me just seems dark and a bit dank - but it might have been humid outside). The food is good, but not extraordinary.

If someone made reservations there, I'd be happy to attend and give this place another shot - afterall, the food is good! But I'd be happy going somewhere else, too."}
{"text":"I always come here 1-2 times a month and I almost always get the Pad Gra Prow with a side of Moo Ping! Very consistent and always amazing"}
{"text":"I've always held off coming to Pai because I thought it was always absolutely packed and that the difference in the quality of Thai food isn't worth that wait. But the verdict? After barely waiting on a weekend, the food is great here, and Pai is a great overall Thai restaurant. 

I was surprised how large this restaurant is. You enter and I only expected it to be a small place (think old Khao San Road) but then we got seated at the inner back area where it was a lot more bright and the music a lot louder. I was pleasantly surprised we didn't have to wait for an early dinner on a Saturday but could see the lines forming as we left. 

There were plenty of options on the menu which is great compared to some other Thai options in the city just sticking with the classics. I appreciate that this place tries to offer more rustic options. Prices are definitely on the steeper side but there's a certain refinement in the food here.

I had the privilege of trying a variety of dishes here. I'll start with the good. Chef Nuit's pad Thai is by far the best pad Thai I've had in the city. The balance is delectable; and the rice noodles were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of elasticity and chew. We went with the veggie pad Thai and it was loaded with tofu and veggies. It also had a nice stir fry taste (wok seared taste I call it) which added that smokiness. 

The Khao soi here was around average. I've definitely had better in the city. I felt it could have been more rich but appreciated the fact they gave the pickled mustard green on the side adding to the authenticity. The braised beef was somewhat dry but the fattier parts provided better balance.

I also tried the miang kung which was a betel leaf wrap. There was a nice mintiness to the leaf and a whole bunch of flavors going on with the coconut, the chilies, the garlic, and the sauces. It would be great to share but not to order as a main. I also tried the Kao pad thamada which was essentially like fried rice. The rice was really fragrant but was rather ordinary. 

Don't forget to order the Thai ice tea here, although pricey, it's a nice compliment to the meal especially if you can't handle the heat and soothes down your taste buds. It's creamy, rich, and sweet."}
{"text":"This is officially my favourite Thai restaurant in downtown! The food is great, I love almost everything on the menu! The environment is very cool, definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Pai definitely lives up to their hype - they are hands down, one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. The khao soi chicken that I ordered was rich, filling and oh-so delicious! I loved the energy at Pai as well - perfect for large parties or dates! There is also a section in the restaurant where you can have a more authentic Thai experience where you sit down on mats and enjoy the delicious food that they serve. We got to the restaurant on a Saturday at around 3 pm - we only waiters for 5 minutes before sitting down. So...if you ever want to come visit Pai but do not want to wait to be seated and you haven't booked reservations, coming in during the late afternoon would be your best option. I am most definitely down for coming back to  Pai again!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised with Pai.
I didn't except this place to be this good. Most Thai food places around Toronto have not been authentic, and/or up to par.
We had several plates for lunch, they were all great (Pad Thai, Pad gra prow, Green Curry chicken/tofu). Couple of us were having Vegetarian plates while the rest had fish and chicken. They were all great. The wait staff was kind enough to let the Vegetarians know that there was fish sauce in some of the dishes.
The staff was also very nice, very friendly, very helpful!
The ambience is very pleasant, trendy."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The tom yum soup is my favourite. I have been here several times and it is still my favourite thai food spot. Warning: do not get the thai spice level of spie!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night in May 2015 and had a 40 minute wait. We just walked around the area and enjoyed the weather. We were seated at the promised time and had prompt and good service from an actual Thai waitress. Not all the staff are Thai. We had spring rolls, two different pad Thai dishes and all was delicious. The seating and tables are spartan and not comfortable. That's a reason why I don't give it 5 stars. I will eat here again though. The food is very good and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food. As good as Khao San Road. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It must have been good cause we was passed out. My Bae Nikki and I drank too much Chang Beer. 

Seriously now.  There are approximately two hundred and fifty five reviews and an unknown number of pics for this amazing restaurant. What else can I add. I have been their twice and do have plans on returning.  Yea there can be some wait times so go across the street to Byblos (I think that is what it is called) and have a couple twenty dollar drinks. They will call you on your cell when your table is ready. I know what else I can add. Pics that my other Bae Mamy took of me and Bae Nikki all hung up on Chang Beer. Peace out Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and relatively inexpensive, butternut fritters for starter were great and the pad thai was extremely tasty. Glad we went with this place. Cool atmosphere inside with some great older hip hop playing..."}
{"text":"Amazing food here, I feel in love with the Khao Soi when I ordered it for the first time. I've also tried the rom yin soup which was as sour as I like it. The servers was all kind. Would say it is a great place to hang to either have a drink or share a meal with."}
{"text":"It was good, went for dinner one day and lunch the next. Both times with diffrent people and everyone seemed to like it both times."}
{"text":"yup. i got SICK here. prob off thai food for a while now.. food was ok. service was meh.  would not return."}
{"text":"Best Pat Thai that I have tried! 

The only drawback is that the space is very small so ideally, you need to book in advance to avoid long waits."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! The food, the service, the ambiance, everything! It's such a drastic difference from the snooty, overpriced, overly trendy, and passé Khao San Road, where the rude/entitled staff and long wait times don't even come close to compensating for their lacklustre food. The quality of food and service at KSR has drastically diminished since the top talents took their skills to Pai.

At Pai, we had the Grabong to start: buttered squash fritters were mouth wateringly delicious. For mains, we shared a pork belly Gaeng Hunglay, which was my fave dish of the night! Our server said the ox tail version is just as tasty so I'm definitely going back again! Lastly, we had the Pad Gra Prow, famous already in downtown Toronto circles. I made a point to compliment the chef on the rich, bold, and memorable flavours of their dishes; I was that impressed! The wait staff, helpful and friendly, offered a relaxed, professional, and family vibe despite the throng of the Thursday night après work downtown crowd. Kudos to the staff who made my first Pai dining experience completely unforgettable! I will definitely be back for more, and frequently!

I would definitely recommend you try the lychee martini cocktail, I forgot what it was called, but it was soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Came here with my SO for dinner.  Nice trendy place, kinda packed and we had to wait a bit for our seat.  It's a nice place for the younger crowd.  

I ordered the braised beef gaeng masaman, she had the green curry.  It came in a coconut, nice trendy presentation of the food.  It looked as good as it tasted; it was so damn delicious, seriously.  Really tender and flavorful. Portion size was pretty good and I felt content after my meal.

Overall I gotta give this place 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Food are very tasty but also very expensive. Spend a long time in line, also, you need to wait for a long time for the food to come. I have been there a couple times and their food were just warmish most of the time"}
{"text":"Love Pai! My favourite place over Khao- less waits and less chaotic. I love their hot and sour soup!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin on my fav Thai restaurant in the city?! Pai has really picked up steam since they opened up last year and rightfully so! Located near the food central king west area, they offer up some of the best and most authentic Thai dishes in Toronto.

The first thing you will notice besides the rustic decor is the vibrant and lively atmosphere of the place. Next, you will likely see is the inevitably long lineup down the flight of stairs so it would be a good idea to arrive early or make a reservation. 

Your best bets:
- Papaya salad with crabs: refreshing, tangy and comes with shrimp chips and small portion of noodles, I definitely recommend opting for the crab option over the shrimp. Never thought of eating raw soft shell crab but they made it work!

- Crispy basa fillet: they do fish really well here so you should try a curry with fish as protein or the crispy basa fillet. The fish is fried to crispy perfection and the sauce is finger licking good. 

- Khao soi (with beef): Khao soi won't be the same after you try it here. The beef is so tender and soaked in their delicious coconut curry broth with yellow noodles.

The drink list has a small beer selection and some unique and fun cocktails. For dessert, the mango with sticky rice is a very authentic dessert in Thailand which not a lot of places have so definitely a bonus! However the mangos are a far substitute to the ridiculously sweet and fragrant ones in Thailand but they make do for now..

Expect to leave satisfied and 100% stuffed!"}
{"text":"Currently my favourite Thai spot in Toronto! I've been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. I've ordered most of the dishes on the menu so I'l only mention my highlights. 

Papaya salad - Huge serving compared to other places I've been to. The aroma and flavours are all reminiscent of SE Asia, with very strong and bold flavours. I got the salted crab variation and there were many pieces of crab included. I was expecting maybe 2-3 pieces! The pork rinds are also a welcome touch of texture. 

Sai Ua Platter (Northern Thai Sausage) - pork sausages, sticky rice and a Thai relish that reminded me of a Vietnamese noodle soup called bun rieu. Sausages had a balanced taste of all the spices and went well with the relish. Sticky rice acted as a good palette cleanser between the salty items. 

Gaeng Hunglay Ox Tail - an oxtail curry that was so tender. A perfect entree dish! 

Other items that are my usual favourites include the pad thai, khao soi, and pa gra prow, however, these are dishes you can get at the other Chef Nuit restaurants. 

Reservations are recommended (if you can get them) but they do allow walk-ins. I've never had to wait longer than 30 mins for a walk-in. Parking is hard to find during peak hours so I would recommend public transit if you can. Service is always friendly but can be a bit slow at times."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night at 7pm with a reservation for a large group of 9 people. We had to wait about 15 minutes for our table though. We were put in a communal table and its busy in there. Its a bit dark and orangey lighting in there. But I love the hanging flags and decor. 

I got the tom yum soup - came with large shrimp which was good but the flavour was ok, could be stronger and hotter in temperature but it had more vegetables than other tom yums that I've tried so that was a plus. The mango sticky rice dessert was also great, no complaints tastes like what it is. The mango was sweet and the rice had good coconut flavour. I tried a bite of other people's food and it was all delicious. 

They have a good drink selection, the thai bucket is fun - comes in a small plastic sand pail with a handful of long straws where everyone can take a sip at the same time - great party starter! 

Service was prompt.  It an excellent place to start the night with the loud and hip crowd and music."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy Thai food. We came here on a Wednesday night at 4:30 and by 5pm, the restaurant was full and a line formed outside. 

I had the green curry in a coconut, lots of depth and layers of flavours, I was by all means not disappointed at all. We also shared spring rolls and satay, both of which were very yummy. 

Pai reminds me of the flavours I've had in Thailand. Food is the most authentic thai food I've had outside of Thailand (albeit still being a little toned down). While I really enjoyed my meal, I don't see myself lining up for 30+ minutes like other patrons for pai."}
{"text":"Loved this place, food is exactly like khao san road. Hard to distinguish except for the atmosphere and sitting arrangement. The place is more lively. Pad ga prao is a must try."}
{"text":"Delicious!   I absolutely loved this place and was completely stuffed when I left.   We headed out a little before 8pm on a Friday.   The place was packed.  There was a line to get in line for a table, which was expected to be an hour.  Normally, I would have bagged it and gone somewhere else, but it smelled amazing in there and I couldn't leave.   

We decided to stick it out and try for a bar seat in the hopes of eating sooner.  Word to the wise - that won't work.  We spotted some people at the bar paying and snagged their seats, only to be told that the bar was considered part of the dining room and that the waiting list applied to it as well.  We were directed to a small waiting bench around the corner, where we had a couple of drinks before our table was ready.   

Once seated, we ordered 3 thai wings and the grabong - both were delicious.  The grabong reminded me of everything I love about funnel cake, but without the overly sweet powdered sugar that I don't like.  You could taste the squash and it wasn't greasy at all - a winner for sure.  The dipping sauce added just the right amount of sweet and salty.  

I followed that up with chicken pad thai (spice level 3) and the boyfriend got the massaman curry (spice level 4).  If I had a criticism about the food, it would be that there is a very large gap between these two spice levels.  Level 3 was perfect for me, but not spicy enough for the boyfriend.  His level 4 was crazy spicy.  I couldn't have eaten it and even he struggled a bit (though he did thoroughly enjoy it).   

The final dish was a mango sticky rice, which was delightful.  Warm rice and cool mango - the perfect ending to a really great meal.  Prices were pretty reasonable as well.   Service was a tad slow, but the place was packed, so I can see why."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant ever. The food is delicious, a great price, and a great size serving.  I usually do a take out order and have always had extremely fresh to order pad thai. I have a food sensitivity issue and they always make sure that my order is correct, I really can't say how much I appreciate that. The service is impeccable whether you do a take out order or sit down to eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here twice, it's super hyped and gets busy, but the food is reaaaally good. Thai food is one of my favourites, and this is one of the best places to get it in Toronto. Try the Khao Soi -- it's super rich and delicious, a little heavy though but that's the point of it :) The Pad Gra Prow is AMAZING, get it with the crispy pork- your tummy will thank you!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst service I've encountered in Toronto. I wanted to come on a public holiday, because everything else in the neighborhood was closed, and I tried calling several times but no one answered. When I arrived, the hostess gave me the worst attitude, asking, \"So do you want to wait or not?\"

Beyond that, the atmosphere is incredibly dark and so noisy that you cannot possibly have a conversation.

Hipsters only."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out because of the high ratings and great reviews on Yelp. I have to give 3/5 stars to this place because it was just alright overall. The ambiance and environment is very laid back and comfortable for friends to just let loose. The decor is nice and menus are \"laid back\" papers as well haha. I ordered the Khao Soi with chicken breast as it looked the most aesthetically pleasing through pictures. I could taste that it's a peanut-based curry under all the spices and flavourings, which is a really unique experience for my tastebuds. I can't deny that it was very salty though and since the portions are so big, I ended up very full and very dry mouthed easily. Good thing others recommended the Thai tea here, which I found to be a great addition to my meal and my friends who ordered a different dish as well. The tea seems to complement many of their offerings. The servers are very sweet and prompt, but I also went during the late lunch hour (3:30pm). I might have to try other places before determining if this is worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"Quite honestly, I decided to reserve a spot at this restaurant because it was new, and had great reviews. However, after my visit, I don't think I will be going back. Firstly, the food is mediocre - some of the dishes that were supposed to come out hot, tasted like they were left at the window too long before making its way to our table. Secondly, it takes two legs and two arms to honestly wave down the staff to get a napkin or water - - Pai Toronto, if you're reading this, I recommend you have the waitress check in ever so often. Thirdly, the recommended Thai Iced Tea is quite disgusting - way too sweet, and needs to be readjusted; I drank two sips and gave up. I'm not saying this restaurant is bad - it has a very good and rowdy atmosphere, but definitely not authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Very nice vibe, and the food was quite good. I continue my quixotic search for Pad Thai that is not too sweet, and this iteration was good, though still a bit on the sweet side for my taste. The Tom Yum soup, however, was absolutely extraordinary!  I got the \"medium\" level of spice, which to my taste was quite spicy, yet not \"hot\" - which was perfect, as far as I'm concerned. Staff were attentive and the food arrived fairly quickly, given how many people the place had packed in.

Only one negative, that keeps the experience from being 5 stars, was the fact that I was bumped into by multiple servers no less than 4 separate times during my meal.

Now I get that it's a busy place, and that they're trying to serve a lot of people, but the first time a waiter bumps into me while I'm sitting down eating my meal, it can be excused. The second time, it's a bit annoying. By the third, I just start to think that the wait staff is moving too quickly. By the fourth, I was just annoyed, and this detracted from the otherwise enjoyable quality of the food and the ambiance.  So get this settled. Either fewer tables, or train the staff to be a bit more graceful with their movement around the place. Because my the end, I felt like I was at a crowded bar at 1am with a bunch of rowdy drunks, and that's dissappointing."}
{"text":"So, so good!  We stumbled upon this place while walking around downtown Toronto before a show.  Atmosphere is definitely trendy and youthful, but the service and food reflect a mature and well-run establishment.  My husband and I each ordered dishes that were new to us (though we've eaten Thai often before), and I couldn't tell you what they were called, but they were both perfectly delicious.  My dish that might have appeared to be a simple rice and shrimp meal was packed with layers of flavor; fresh, light and immensely satisfying.  Every plate that passed by our table looked and smelled amazing.  Server was attentive and knowledgeable.  Free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, you cannot miss this little gem. The staff are amazing - everyone is very friendly. We used to eat at Khao San Road so when we found out the chef opened this place, we had to follow. 

The setting is super trendy and fun. It feels like you're in trendy Thailand. 

We're so glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Khao soi is F***ING *drools*. The green curry is nice but the Khao soi steals the show.
A little on the moderately pricey side but not ground breaking. The sausage appetizer plate runs on the small size considering the price, but extremely satisfying."}
{"text":"Before we even begin, let me tell you that this place is serious about its spice levels. Mild is spicy. Medium is very spicy. Just our opinion. Gringos be warned.

When you walk down the steps to this place, you notice how many people inside are of Asian descent. This is a good sign. The wait was about 20 minutes, and we amused ourselves watching people and checking the decor, as well as with the classic American rock music that was playing. There were records on the walls.

The menu isn't long. The drink menu, I think, has more. We skipped the apps and starters and went straight for the meal. We had the same thing, which I can't recall the name of. It was on the top right of the main course menu, under the northern Thai section.

The sticky rice was great. The crispy pork was fantastic. The sauce was very tasty, even though it was very spicy. Lots of flavors. We may go back to try something else while we're here, which is about the highest compliment you can pay a place, right?

UPDATE: We went back. Wife had the curry with braised beef and I had the soup with beef broth. We dialed the spice down one notch each. It was fantastic. The wait was still there - there's never not one, it seems. We were seated in the chairless booth on mats. Loved it. Add half a star."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and really enjoyed my experience yet again. 

Once we got a number, we were directed to the bar to enjoy a drink or two while we wait inside the restaurant for them to buzz our number. During our wait, we ordered Tom Yum Caesar and Thai Mojito. Tom yum Caesar felt really strange at first, as it felt like cold tom yum soup with alcohol, but slowly became addicting. 
 
When we finally got seated after about 20 to 30 minutes, we ordered:
1- Miang Kung - various ingredients wrapped in betel leaf (really different than what I had tried before, it felt really refreshing...if you'd like a cold dish for appetizer, I'd recommend this dish. It's great that you can control your flavour to your liking as well
2- Tom yum kung - large pot of tom yum soup with large shrimps, served with a bowl of white rice (it's a good portion to share between 2 people, a lot of soup)
3- Pad gra prow - basil stir fried with our selection (tofu) ... also a tasty dish, but became really spicy

Overall, I had really enjoyed the environment, except that it was unfortunate that the fire alarm went off and we were beside it, so a few tables around us including us rushed through dinner and left. Not sure what happened, but hopefully that won't happen again!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a week day. The place was not that busy. Felt like i was in a tropical environment by the way the restaurant was decorated which really set the mood towards the amazing food I was about to eat.

The place was clean. The service was alright. The food was very tasty and flavourful. I tasted all the key notes you would find in a Thai dish.

The bottles of water tripped in out because I thought there were birds in the restaurant hehehehe. That was a cute and fun touch."}
{"text":"Currently the best Thai food in Toronto. These folks previously worked at Khao San Road and left to open Pai. It's more roomy and inviting here with the same high quality authentic food previously served at Khao San Road (chef Nuit). 

A few highlights include the best Tom Yum soup in the city. Sweet and sour never came in a better form. The soup got the approval of some folks who grew up with Tom Yum soup in Asia. Also, a phenomenally fragrant green curry, (gaeng kiaw wan) served in a coconut. Excellent flavor. These two dishes are must orders. 

The pad gra prao with crispy pork was solid and filling. A spicy gaeng hunglay with oxtail rounded out a fantastic meal. 

The papaya salad to start was interesting with a selection of DIY sides that spurs the appetite. 

Given the advantages in seating and atmosphere with the same tasty food, this is the best place satisfy your Thai food cravings."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and I bookmarked this place so long ago seeing all the reviews and all. 

Entered the place and thought wow it's so cute! Waited 25 mins got seated and figured out that the khao sai was sold out with chicken and beef just tofu and shrimp :))))))) went for shrimp. It was good! The curry was delicious. Everything else fell real short. Papaya salad- below average. My mother who isn't Thai makes better Papaya salad. Pad Thai- eh I've had better in LA. The rice plate was ok.

It was snowing, and I didn't realize that you can't park upfront without a permit. Got a parking ticket :))) In conclusion, this was an average thai joint for me on the high end in my wallet(with the ticket)"}
{"text":"Love! Love! The food here! Love how the green curry comes in a coconut and you can eat the coconut meat. Also the papaya salad can be ordered with raw crabs and it's one of my favorites! Super spicy! If you come early you can get a seat quickly... You can't go wrong with anything! We love coming here everytime we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Outside of my favorite Thai restaurant from growing up, definitely the best Thai I've had anywhere. We arrived a bit early and were seated immediately, but it was clearly a popular place and there was quickly a line waiting for tables. The drink list here was super unique, with tasty options such as the Lowry (gin, lemongrass syrup, mint, lychee juice and soda) and the Thai Ross (vodka, Kahlua, Creme de Cacao, Thai iced tea). Delicious. For dinner I went standard with the Pad Thai and wasn't disappointed. The table seemed to have some issues with their spice levels - an appetizer was ordered medium and was scalding hot, while two mains ordered a spice level higher were almost spice-free and had to be supplemented. Altogether, a solid experience and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I appreciate the variety offered, but in terms of taste, the dishes I had were solidly average. spring rolls, Pad Thai, curry chicken, sticky rice. None stood out, really."}
{"text":"This place is delicious with great service and a vibe that makes you feel like you're right back in Thailand. Having gone to Thailand a number of times now, I can say that this place has delivered the most authentic Thai food out of all the Thai restaurants I've tried in Toronto. I would recommend going late afternoon as I've never had an issue getting seating then."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. I loved the Tom Yum soup, the spice level was made to perfection. The green curry chicken was also very good. The staff is very professional and the restaurant has a friendly outgoing vibe. I highly recommend this place. They also deliver and they're usually on time which is great."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food and great staff - a winning combination! I had the Gaeng Hunglay - pork belly (also available with ox tail) and a ginger curry rub in a clay pot, served with rice. I've never seen it on a menu before and it was recommended so I had to give it a try. I also ordered the Pad Thai. Too much food for sure, but when I go to a new Thai place, I always want to sample a couple of things. Both were prepared simply and were really exceptional. The menu is a little limited - only about 20 items including starters and mains. This is good I think. It means the things that are on the menu are done very well. It's apparent there is a lot of attention paid to the offerings here. 

Speaking of staff, everyone was really friendly and helpful. I sat at the bar, so I saw more of them than I would have had I been at a table. No fewer than 4 people asked me how I enjoyed my meal. They've only been open about a month so enthusiasm is very high. I get the sense that everyone is fairly dedicated to the chef, the concept and the idea that they are bringing authentic and delicious Thai cuisine.

Pai reminds me a lot of Pok Pok - Andy Ricker's incredible top Thai place in Portland Oregon."}
{"text":"We arrived without reservations and were sitted on the bar after around 10 minutes (on Sat around 3).
We got:
Moo Ping (Sweet Grilled Pork on a skewer) - fantastic!
Spring Rolls - great, light and not that industrious crap.
Chef Nuit Pad Thai - AMAZING. one of the best pad thai's I ever had (including those we got in Thailand)
Pad Gra Prow (ground pork with holy basil, on fried rice with an egg on top) - honestly, it was bad, but nothing amazing. just... OK."}
{"text":"good thai food, but I would prefer sabai sabai over this."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Although the pad thai isn't as good as Khao San Road, it still good. I really enjoyed the appetizers here. We had Som Tum Tad (papaya salad), Plah Nua (beef salad), laap salad and squash fritters. I must say that I enjoyed the appetizers so much that I would come back just for them and skip the main dishes. However, the Pad Gra Prow was really good. I haven't tried this dish anywhere else but this would be my go-to main dish and the appetizers are a must! Mainly the papaya salad, beef salad and laap salad as the squash fritters are pretty much the same everywhere."}
{"text":"Honestly THE most outstanding Thai food I have ever had in my entire life. I ordered my staple white girl Chicken Pad Thai. Every single bite was immensely filled with flavour. The spicy level was light for \"medium\" but it was so delicately done that you could still savour the taste of the noodles. Unreal food. 

The service was quick and forthright. Everything was prompt and they kept the tables nice and clean as you ate picking up chop stick wrappers as they walked by with lightening speed. Just the right amount of checking in with you periodically so as to not disturb or be an annoyance. 

The ambiance was awesome. They played reggae and dancehall music which shot me straight back to bar hopping and high school dances. It forced my girlfriend and I smile and seat dance a little bit! They had simple table decor with just one lit candle. It was a bit loud but I was totally into it!! It's definitely my new fav for Thai food."}
{"text":"I was lucky to try this place as my friend had made reservations months - yes you read that right, months! - early in advance for this place when I planned to visit Toronto. I didn't understand why the reso was needed for a Thursday night but when I got there and saw the crowds of people standing by the entry way, I was thankful for our reso. 

There are various types of seating at this restaurant including high tables with high chairs, regular tables, and also traditional sitting areas where you have to basically sit on the floor cross legged. If you are picky about how you sit, I would make sure to note this when making resos. 

The restaurant overall had a very bar/pub like feel and was extremely loud, which was not what I expected at all given the need for resos and the high reviews. The restaurant was quite big though, and it sounded like the wait for a table for two on a regular night was about 30min+. It's nice they have a waiting area as it was extremely cold outside!

The menu had a good variety of items and everything sounded great. After reading through the Yelp reviews, we ordered the deep fried squash for our appetizer to share - good thing there was four of us because it was a huge stack of food. The best thing that made this dish was the sauce, and I would honestly have never known it was squash as it tasted more like yam or sweet potato. This was my favourite dish. 

We ordered the massaman curry as that is a regular fav of mine at most curry places, and the pad gra prow. We asked for both to be foreign spicy but they said that they serve the dishes as mild or medium and could give us extra spice on the side. Good thing we did as I actually found the medium quite spicy. I found the pad gra prow underwhelming visually, and the beef in my curry to be actually pretty tough. I expected the beef to be tender and melt in your mouth quality. However, the flavours for both dishes were strong and tastes authentic, and I was happy my curry did not taste watered down as a lot of Thai places do. 

After being quite satisfied with our meals, we wanted to order dessert. However the staff notified us that they were out of everything..??? Possible on a regular Thursday night? I was quite disappointed. 

Overall, service was good but nothing over the top friendly, and the food was great. I thought it was a bit expensive as the portions were average but the flavours were definitely great. Our food took a long long time to come out (at least 30min) and I'm not sure if this is the norm or they were particularly busy this night. 

I liked that the location was within walking distance from the train stations, and I did not drive so I'm not sure what the parking situation is like. 

Overall I would recommend this place if you like the energetic, bustling atmospheric and good Thai food. Not a good place to having convos with your friends for a long time though as I found it quite distracting and hard to speak loud enough to hear everyone at my table."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in the city. Busy lineups during dinner time but you won't regret it. Must try if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"This is my go to for no frills, consistently good Thai food. The Chicken Pad Thai and Green Curry with Fish are winners; as are the sweet potato fritters! 

They do takeout and delivery which is amazing!"}
{"text":"It's authentic and the interior is pretty cool. It's a half basement and the food is cooked slightly different than other Thai places. I did notice that they use a lot of MSG (I am very sensitive to it) so I couldn't digest the food well but the funnier thing was that it wasn't even seasoned properly. Anyway, it's nice to go try once but I don't think I'll be craving it any time soon."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Staff did not rush me to order as I waited for my boyfriend to show up (and he was laaaaaate) even though the restaurant was getting packed. Both drinks ordered cojo and something else were delicious. Also tried the Thai fried rice and beef noodles soup. Very flavourful and generous portions. Would come back another time and try their other items."}
{"text":"This place always seems busy so it's probably best to go at non-peak hours. I had their chicken pad Thai and would say it's definitely one of the better ones I've tried. They give you a good amount of chicken and the portion is big enough to fill most people. The noodles were the right texture and the sauce was on point. Only thing I would change is there was a bit too much chive/coriander which over powered some of the other flavours. Also wish that the interior of the restaurant was a bit more practical as the seating arrangements aren't the best and there wasn't a good place to hang jackets. Overall I definitely think I would return and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and a fun atmosphere. Expect to wait in line for up to an hour during peak hours. Is the food worth the wait? I'd say so."}
{"text":"Let's get serious here. The food was good not great and priced appropriately (on the cheap side) given how much rice a typical dish seemed to include. The wine was a skimpy 4 oz glass. 

The fried fish was very, very good and the food came out quickly once we were finally seated. 

But the noise levels were through the roof making any conversation impossible. 

The place was super busy and a wait was inevitable. But they need better communication when the waiting stretches from the promised 30 minutes to close to an hour. 

This all might have been tolerable if we had not been seated next to a very large table of self absorbed, self indulgent 20 something Yuppies. Dancing in the isles to barely audible music when you are seated cheek to jowl in a crowded small space is beyond the pale."}
{"text":"Great authenic thai food, variety of options. Greta place to expect waiting times, book early."}
{"text":"We had a great time there! Great value for money! We went there as part of a bachelorette, and ended up a bigger group than expected. They were able to figure out a space for everyone (about 24 people), and keep a good level of service. I'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Expect about a 40-minute wait without a reservation. If you get a chance, order the green curry served in a coconut. Definitely a must-try! It's probably one of the best Thai green curries I've ever had. Love the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant (definitely adds to the experience)."}
{"text":"It's great that they take reservations! We got here around 7pm and the atmosphere was lively but quiet enough to not have to shout at your friends sitting across the table.  I really enjoyed the layout and interior design of the restaurant! We all ordered the Thai iced tea which was delicious. We ordered the spring rolls, pad thai shrimp, Gaeng Hunglay (oxtail dish)  and Khao Soi. The Pad Thai dish was the best out of all three mains. The oxtail was tender and the sauce was delicious. The Khao Soi was our least favourite as it was too salty for us. All three items were ordered at the 'medium' spicy although the pad thai was the only dish we could taste the spice in."}
{"text":"One of my faaaavourite thai restos in the dot. Minus the lonnger than average wait for a table/food, the food is well worth the wait. Must try the papaya salad! Super flavourful and crunchy (if you like that texture). Any dish you order that has meat with it is bound to be tender and they give you hearty servings of it as well! Coconut green curry is served in an actual coconut, which is soo cool (yes, you CAN and SHOULD eat the coconut afterwards). & if you still have room for dessert, I recommend the mango sticky rice; the mangoes are ripe and sweet, while the rice is thick and warm."}
{"text":"So so many people waiting in line to be serviced for tables.  The price is reasonable and food is just ok. Feels like a bar with noisy music."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, most recently for some friend's birthdays. It was packed, prepare to line up if you're coming for dinner on the weekend. We had a party of 12 so we made reservations ahead of time, they also tried to make us go with the special set menu which was $50/person, we somehow convinced them to let us order our own food. Food's always good from what I remember. definitely recommend the fried squash as an appetizer/share plate. I had the Khao Soi(egg noodles and beef in a curry sauce) which was good"}
{"text":"The restaurant is always busy but well worth the 45 minute wait (maybe not in -30 degree weather). We has their pad thai, and both curries on the menu and they are absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is chill. We also ordered ginger beer and lemongrass soda.

The only drawback is that it took a while to get our food. If they could fix that I would give these guys five stars."}
{"text":"I have now been to Pai three times because the first time I went just wasn't enough. Went night one and ordered a cool mule and loved it so much I ordered the ingredients so I can make my own at home in Ottawa. The pad gra prow is SO good - definitely recommend getting the beef and their green curry is probably the most authentic I have had since being in Thailand. The food is fantastic, the service is great and the atmosphere is one of the best. The place is busy and just keeps going further as you walk around corners. I have never had to wait very long for a table though and they have a cute little stand up bar area so you can order drinks while you wait. I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. Great food. Good music. Huge beers available.
Seeing as I have quite a few food retrictions, food allergies and vegetarian, they always have good options for me. I particularly love the pad gra prow and the green curry. Ps if you like spicy, this is a great spot for you!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner right after watching a show at the theater. The place was packed and yet the atmosphere is such that you can still have a conversation without shouting. 
The food is simply amazing. For starters we had some crispy delicious spring rolls, guy satai chicken skewers with curry and spicy dipping sauce. 
And for the main we had pad Thai with chicken or beef. The noodles were prefect, the dish had a fresh aroma that made it absolutely delightful. 
The prices are so reasonable for a place downtown. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a layover in Toronto so we decided to hop on the city train and check out the downtown scene. We decided on this Thai restaurant nearby. We had to sit at the bar because all the tables were taken but we loved the experience.  This place is amazing! We had the spring rolls and the chicken wings. I would order them every time without hesitation. You must come to this place if you are in town!"}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place in the city. I love the Gaeng Hunglay Ox Tail and Khao Soi.

Most of the time I'm ordering in via Uber since I don't live close to the restaurant but I do like going in as well since the vibe and feel of the restaurant is great as well."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying yes I would go back. However, there were some flaws + by no means is this The Best Thai Restaurant in North America. I'm going to keep it real with y'all because I'm not a sheep + I don't buy into hype/follow the crowd. You want the real deal? Then listen up cuz I'll give it to you straight, no chaser. 

Let me break it down.....

Ambiance/Atmosphere:
Rustic and warehouse type of feel but with a slight touch of Thailand. The aesthetic of this restaurant is very nice, lots of wood, weird vintage embellishments and interesting mix of music. The restaurant itself is huge (there's multiple bars and seating areas). Our spot was at back end of the restaurant. I was surprised at how far back the restaurant went. Lots of nice nooks and crannies to take cool photos for your social media accounts ;) the lighting is very dim though so the shots may not turn out as high quality with your phone. Bring your DSLR booboo. Don't worry about dressing up too much as it's a casual place.

Food/Drinks:
- It is pretty authentic, however, our food took around 45 minutes to come
- So have you ever had lukewarm food?? Never in my life have I experienced Thai or Vietnamese food that was \"lukewarm.\" What a horrible surprise! I thought it was just me but my friends that ordered the green curry were like nope mine's kinda cold too. 
- Now let's get to everyone's favourite, the drinks. They were very watered down IMO and the bartenders were STINGY with it. I hate stingy drinks, freaking despise it. It's just like ordering drinks at a club instead of pregaming at a proper bar or going to your local mixologist connoisseur friend Bob, who has a massive stash at his place and lives to entertain + make you a drink like no other. My friend and I ordered a Sake bombs. The waitress said it was 3 shots in one but tbh it looked like 2 and a half shots, not 3. Yeeeaaaahhhh they're stingy af with their booze #notcute. The place has to make money, I understand that. However, if I'm seeing all these stellar reviews making this place out be god's gift to the earth then I'm obviously not gonna sit back and act like everything is all hunky dory with a big ass smile on my face. 
- Not as vegan friendly/dairy-free as one would think. The menu online doesn't really mention anything about dairy but the menu at the restaurant kept on listing (contains dairy) so much that I was like, you know let me just stick with the Pad Cha Hett (vegan option) before I screw myself over. I'm more of a pescetarian because I eat seafood so I would have ordered the seafood dishes but I'm just not a fan of dairy or hen's period so yeah. I have to go back and do some more investigating on that front. Their veggie spring rolls and other stuff could probably provide more variety for someone that is vegan/vegetarian etc. BTW ONE vegan option on your menu does not mean your restaurant is vegan friendly. I guess you can order sides and appetizers that are vegan/dairy-free but that would just add up and make everything more expensive and I don't believe that anyone should have to drop $50 to have a good/decent meal in they city. It's not worth it.
- Granted all that has been said, the portion sizes of the dishes are very good. My friends and I received decent portions for our main course orders. We were all full and despite the food being lukewarm, the spices and flavour were on point. 

Service: 
Service was very fast and efficient. It was very busy the night we went (Sunday). There were multiple waitors/waitresses attending to us. They kept on asking if my group was ready to order and kind of pressured/rushed us to order but yeah we weren't fazed. The bad thing we encountered was how a particular loud-mouthed waitress handled our bill situation in the end. We all asked for separate bills. She comes throws down the bills and quickly and says \"I just split the spring rolls between everyone.\" Ok so only one of my friends ordered that appetizer and ate it by herself, we did not share that dish. We nearly were going to pay and work out the difference which a customer should not have to do. The waitress was definitely at fault here and did us a shady move. The second time round was not better as our bills were still mixed up so we told her exactly what we ordered and finally got an accurate bill (3rd attempt).

Crowd/Scene: 
This place is honestly just a student dive lol. I didn't see anyone over 40 except for one lady. She looked cool. I wanted to chit chat with her. Very LIVELY and LOUD. Good for double dates not 1 on 1 dates. Could be good for pregaming. I guess the more alcohol you order, the more the bartender will notice and give you a good round. If you're mainly going for drinks then stick with drinks and a few appetizers. If you're going for food then don't expect the drinks to be strong. If you're introverted and aren't really outgoing then this envi. may not be your favourite lol. Not good for overly large groups. Keep your group sizes smallish ;)"}
{"text":"Very tasty, Good pad thai and northern style food. I have to say I was  little disappointed after reading such great reviews. It's worth a visit but I wasn't blown away.

Also goo prices with the portions you get."}
{"text":"Very popular place, as evident from the line that you will face if you did not make a reservation. The wait was around an hour, so my friends and I decided to just get take out. They said it would take around 40 minutes, but it came out a lot faster than that, which was great!

Food was pretty good. Nothing really mind blowing or extravagant, but it wasn't bad at all. Portion size seemed pretty reasonable for the amount you are paying for. Also the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.

If I were to visit Toronto again, I don't know if I would visit Pai. It was good, but not to the point of making me want to go again. But overall, I would recommend if you're in the area. Probably best to make a reservation, unless you are okay with waiting or getting carry out."}
{"text":"As i was eating there I was thinking Pai was very similar to Sabai Sabai and Khao San and then i found out that they are apparently owned by the same owners so no wonder there. Unlike other Thai places the menu is minimal with only a few options listed but the food is great. I tried their Khao San and loved it. I know it has noodles but i would still get a side of rice since i really like the flavorful broth and could still eat that with the rice. Also the bowl by itself wouldn't fill me up. Unlike other Thai restaurants that I've been too, the prices are also higher.

Food: 4.5/5
Service and atmosphere: 4/5
Price: 3.5/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"The place is packed even at 5pm, it will be better for you to make reservation if you need a table of 2 or more. Unless you don't mind sitting at the bar table. I had chicken pad Thai, it tastes so good, I would recommend anyone who likes Thai food to go to PAI. I don't think you will be disappointed. I will have to go back to try other dishes they have!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were feeling the munchies and decided to check this place out. 

The restaurant is located under street level so you need to walk down a few stairs (a concern only if you have mobility issues). Lighting is low/dim but thats part of the vibe/atmosphere. I found the staff friendly, quick and efficient. There is plenty of seating but it does quickly fill up after 6/7pm. If you have a big group, there is a private room in the back or a tatami style area in the front near windows that has 2 large tables with cushions (I would definitely visit again just to sit there lol). 

For food, I had the popular Thai Ice Tea and Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken. Both very tasty! The Thai tea was refreshing and the Pad Thai had a nice sauce for the rice noodles."}
{"text":"This was the first place in Toronto that my friends and I went right after we got off the plane. The decor is very cute and fitting to the setting of Thai food. The wait to be seated wasn't too bad for an afternoon on a Thursday. The wait for the food was a bit long, however when our friend arrived 40mins after us, her food came right out. 

I felt this was a great place for lunch. Is it the best Thai food I've ever had? Hard to say. To me, I am a bit snobby with taste. I don't like things too overpowering or under seasoning, on top of that it must be gluten free (Not by choice, Celiac disease). It was definitely delicious, I would highly recommend it. But it's not mind blowing or life changing. It's yummy Thai food. It's gluten free friendly, lots of options to choose from their limited menu. 

On the side note, Toronto has lots of great places to eat! Some with more creativity and originality than others!"}
{"text":"The flavours are on point. The closet you are able to get to actually eating in Thailand. They have a wonderful private room with a great family style menu. The portion sizes are amazing and everyone will leave stuffed. I wish I could recommend my favourite items...:but they are all spectacular in their own way.  

It is a perfect location for birthdays, first dates, anniversaries. You name it....this is the place to celebrate it. 

What are you waiting for? Go check it out!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I ever had!!! The appetizers are generous and super tasty...the green curry in the coconut shelf...I could have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!!"}
{"text":"The cocktails here are absolutely delicious. The food was pretty good but we were definitely expecting a larger menu, especially at a thai restaurant. They only have about ten dishes on the menu. It's very busy and has a huge hipster vibe. Probably wouldn't go back for the thai food, as I've had better, but would definitely get another cocktail."}
{"text":"This remains our top thai restaurant in Toronto for the Pad Thai and for the Pad Gra Prao. Just got back from Thailand and I would say the Pad Gra Prao is authentic and comparable to what you would find there. 

It's great that they expanded the location which has reduced the wait time a bit but do expect to still have to line up for a table. 

Would easily have given this place 5 stars only I've found (might just be me) that the portions have gotten a bit smaller during lunch - relative to previous times I've been there for lunch. 

Overall, highly recommend. Great lively atmosphere and awesome food."}
{"text":"Have dined in and out several times and in the words of Meryl Streep AMAZING experience each and every time! The wings are especially authentic with great plating and superb taste. Huge on dessert and have tried one of each to my delight :)"}
{"text":"A varied menu with plenty of options for me (vegan) and others. Good cocktails and service. They're usually quite busy which is a good sign. A bit disorganized with reservations I've found and you might have to wait even if you've reserved. Great food and probably the best Thai I've had in the city. Not totally in love with the ambience but I prefer quieter settings."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. We came here with high hopes of enjoying good thai food at around 3 PM on a Saturday. We had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table but it was fine since you could enjoy a drink at the bar while waiting. When it was time, we finally got seated in a small table. Our waiter was barely paying attention even though we were sitting right next to cashier. The food came out and the portions were small for the price. I didn't really enjoy my meal as there was barely any meat and more curry than anything. When we were done with our meal, I was still hungry so you can tell how small the portions were... It was definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"I've never had any Thai food before coming to this place and after trying Pai out, it's like a whole new world has opened up for me. This place was pretty good. Had the Pad Gra Prow, which was egg on top of beef and rice and it was pretty good. 

Pai had a decent wait time, seems like a popular place to be and with good reason. 

The environment was awesome. The music they played was old school hip hop. And the servers was pretty nice too 

One of the better places that I've been too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was casual and hip, food and drinks were amazing, and service/servers were fantastic and very kind. I loved this place. As soon as I walked in I loved the fun and relaxing atmosphere. Our servers were very nice and chatted shortly with us.  Would come back even just for drinks."}
{"text":"Just checked into Toronto and found this Thai place for lunch. Had high expectations based on reviews and wasn't let down. Great food! Ordered green curry with chicken- awesome taste and chicken was cooked just right (not over-cooked like most other Thai places). My wife got pad Thai- usually I can't eat it at all (don't like it)- but when I tasted that fish it was amazing! Wished I ordered that as well.  Highly recommend this place. In addition to great food it has a very nice ambience too."}
{"text":"we loved this place on our visit to toronto. amazing food and great drinks. awesome ambiance"}
{"text":"Solid Thai Food!

Tips:
If you come from a brown family (like myself lol) or are generally comfortable with spices, go with THAI SPICY, it  is not unbearably spicy and is actually very flavourful.

Food:
Fried Shrimp - BEST APPETIZER EVER! the shrimps very fried perfectly and the sauce that came with it, came directly from thai heaven.
Pad Thai - As good as a Pad Thai can get, almost the same taste as Sukho Thai.
Khao Soi - It was tasty but i found it a bit lacking in flavour, perhaps because they only make it mild and you can add chilli sauce to it if you want to make it spicy. It's still very good but not something I will get again.

Service:
Now this is where the place truly shines. They are always very busy but they have plenty of seating, they also have enough staff to take care of things efficiently.

We were seated within 10 minutes, our order was taken promptly, our first appetizer came pretty quickly and the second appetizer came right after we finished the first. Other restaurants can learn from Pai how to do Appetizers and main, these guys made it seamless unlike other restaurants where you're just sitting after appetizers.

One more thing that I loved about their service from my experience:
I ordered a Pineapple shake, but I told the server that I don't want much ice - What happens next will SHOCK YOU (No buzzfeed it wouldn't)

The person responsible for making the shake came out of the kitchen and talked to me on how i wanted it as the shake is pretty much made with ice. I have never interacted with kitchen staff and it made me feel really pampered. 

In short, Loved the experience, will definitely go back and try more things."}
{"text":"Shockingly disappointing....
I have had Pai in the back of my mind almost all of 2017 since they were voted best Thai restaurant on blogTO. My usual Thai is Khao San road but I was happy to snag a 9 PM reservation two months before some family visiting. 
However, that anticipation and satisfaction of delicious Thai street food was sadly crushed as the food was completely average. We got soup, Khao soi, kad pra gra, and pad Thai and all dishes were just okay. Flavor was lacking and I was surprised to hear that they couldn't make Khao soi spicy. I understand that it's a coconut base so it's hard to spice it up but it is still definitely possible, as other restaurants would prove.

Ambiance of the restaurant is super nice and customer service was really good."}
{"text":"Just came back from by birthday dinner at Pai. Everything we ate and drank was so amazing! I initially made a reservation for 7 people, some couldn't make it and when I tried to change to reservation to 4 people it wouldn't allow for it and next thing I knew, I got an email that said my reservation was cancelled -I guess something went wrong with the Bookenda reservation system (or me). When we got to Pai, it was lined up and I explained my situtation, they sat us pretty quickly and even though the place was packed everything still went great. I'm celiac and they clearly mark all of the gluten-allergy alert foods with a purple dot, making everything extra easy. We got great drinks, the Plum Mule ($10) was the best for sure, and the papaya and salted crab salad was excellent -although \"foreigner spicy\" is actually really spicy! Thoroughly loved it at Pai!"}
{"text":"Frankly speaking - having been to Chef Nuit's other restaurant, my expectation for this restaurant is very high and sure enough Pai delivered. The food execution (we ordered Pad Thai and Pad ga prow) was flawless with all the taste hitting its mark and cooking is just superb. As always, it brought us back to Thailand figuratively speaking. 

Service despite being very very busy is also very friendly, welcoming yet efficient at the same time. Food arrives promptly - the server checks on us regularly and the bill comes promptly too. Reservation few days in advance is highly recommended. 

So why not five star? One minor thing - we found that the portion size for the appetizer (satay) was too small for its price and the main was just a tad smaller as well. Maybe it's just me that used to a tad larger portion size in the other establishment (Khao San I recall has bigger portion size and even Suko-thai)

Definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Busy place, but well worth the wait. 

Went here on a Friday night with a group of 4 around 7pm - prime dinner time. We waited about an hour for a table, which wasn't all that bad. They text you when the table is ready, so that allows you to leave and grab a drink if you wish.

For starters I got the deep fried squash($11) and it was heavenly. It was a lot of food for a starter and definitely shareable between 4 people. It has had great presentation. Make sure you dip it in the sauce they provide you. 

I ended up having the pad graw pow, with crispy beef ($16.50) and it was delicious. I'm not much of a spice guy, so I got it with medium spice and I found that to be perfect - it was spicy, but I wasn't reaching for my drink after every bite. My friend got the khao so and I had some - that tasted even better and I was pretty jealous. Next time I'll definitely have to get that. 

Excellent atmosphere, fast service, great food and right in the heart of downtown - what more can you ask for. The price is obviously amazing considering where you are in the city and how busy the place is. They could probably charge double and only lose about 3% of their customers. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food is truly outstanding.  We had the coconut curry with shrimp and some kind of fried rice dish, and both were great.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Truly the best Thai restaurant in the city. 
We arrived around after 7 on a Wednesday night which was prime time. They do not take same day reservations. The wait was just about under an hour and decided to wait. You may sit by the bar and there is also a bench in another room that you can sit and wait. We waited about 45 mins unil we got to our table.
The vibe is very loud and they played great music. The decor was very cozy as if you are at your friend's house for dinner. I loved all the photographs on the wall.

They have daily drink specials. 
I ordered mango juice and and my bf ordered a beer. We could not decide on an appetizer so we had asked the server their favourite dish to which she suggested the battered squash. 
BTW unfortunately I do not remember the Thai names.
When it arrived, it looked like fritters and shoe strings. The dip was like a mixture of sweet chili sauce and fish sauce.  It was so delicious. What a great start to our dinner.

For our mains, we ordered the Khao Soi and or course, a curry fiend.. the Coconut Green Curry. It is served in a coconut.
My Coconut Green Curry was definitely the BEST in the city that I have ever had. 
I can also scrape off the coconut which soaked in all the flavors.  The Khao Soi was also so delicious.
I cannot wait to go back and try the other dishes. Also an awesome place for after work drinks! !!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Busy location but they work and move customers orders fast the staff is great, well worth the wait. Beautiful Bartender served me snd she was excellent, and so cute. She was very helpful, great to have there. The food was amazing the starters and Ox Tail was great. I will go again! Staff was fantastic!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try Pai as it was on my list of food places to go to. It was a Sunday night and we decided to try our luck and walk in, they told us they we could put our name down and come back around 6:30 since we also thought it was too early for dinner. 
Soon enough we came back, we waited for maybe 10 mins and sat down at our table. This place is busy and I loved the fun and casual vibe! I loved the decor and atmosphere, as I also noticed spider man- literally a figurine- hanging above us lol!
We were quickly served our water and the server promptly asked for our drink orders. No doubt about it, you got to try the Thai ice tea- it is definitely spot on!  
For the entree, I didn't know what to order but I was eye'ing the 2 dishes with egg in them. After asking our knowledgeable server, I got the pad kra prow moo krob- minced meat, crispy pork and egg with rice. I didn't know what to expect since I usually get pad Thai or curry at Thai places and I wanted to be adventurous this time. Omgee..this dish is bomb! It's fatty but they cooked the crispy pork so well that it just melts in your mouth- I am so glad I took the server's recommendation! The dish is very yummy and the portion is very generous. 
My friends ordered pad Thai and the curry. They all enjoyed it. We also shared  the sai ua platter which is northern Thai sausages served with sticky rice and this spicy sauce which makes it super tasty.

We were so full that we didn't try the mango sticky rice- next time for sure!
Oh...and also the squash fritters next time..."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE did I mention LOOOOOOOOOVE this place!! So good I drive here all the way from mississauga. 

They have an amazing Pad Thai that can also be made vegan which is not as easy as you may think (for it to still taste good that is!) 

Everything I've had here was amazing, spring rolls, pad Thai, dessert, green curry just TRY EVERYTHING! 

They are packed on weekends and do not take reservations :( which is my only issue here. But then again the place isn't very big so I understand. 

The vibe of the inside is super cool too, looks like the streets of a Thai market. 

I also found out they even have a private room you can book for events and large groups. 

If you haven't been here yet and are contemplating it, stop thinking! JUST GO! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I have always heard good things about this place. A friend of mine and I tried to walk in on a Friday night without a reservation, big mistake. Although, months later I finally got the chance to try it out. I went on a weekday right when it opened, and there was not much of a crowd. 

I had the 'Chef Nuit Pad Thai' with chicken. My friend had the 'Thai Fried Rice'. We loved them both. I was able to finish my pad thai considering the portion was just around the normal side (not too big, not too little). I was expecting a bigger selection on the menu. 

The environment was super casual and chill during the day. The service was a little slow, but the staff was super friendly nonetheless. 

I would definitely come back to try their desserts."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! i would come back to try everything on the menu. The curry is flavorful, the prices are really good for everything you get. It looks like there's not much but it's really filling. The decor is dreamy ans the service is great!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant, atmosphere was cool, Kao Sui was just amazing, creamy coconut curry sauce, beef, egg noodles and fried noodles. Some of my colleagues have been here several times, they had fried rice and were happy with their choice. It was quite crowded during weekday lunch time, to beat the crowd try to be there as soon as they open at 11:30am. Bon appetite!!!"}
{"text":"After watching a TIFF movie at the Scotiabank theatre, my friends and I walked to this restaurant, seeing how it has really good reviews. We were welcomed by a really friendly (and cute!) server and seated immediately. The environment, as said by my friends, is very much like Thailand. Lighting is very dim, but sets the a nice mood for being loud and social. Our waiter was very friendly and talkative which contributed to part of our positive experience.

I ordered the green curry in a coconut ($16), mainly because I wanted to eat out of a coconut haha! I asked for mild and it was the perfect amount of spicyness - not too overwhelming but still has that nice kick. I could not finish the whole dish because it was just so filling. The coconut could not fit all of the curry so they put it into another bowl which I barely touched because eating everything out of the coconut already made me full. The presentation of the dish was very appetizing to look at and I had an enjoyable time eating my dish. The prices are average which is why I only gave it 4 stars but the food was AMAZING.

I will definitely come back to try the pad thai whenever I'm in downtown!

TL;DR amazing food, fun environment, average price but would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Its hard to find a really good thai restaurant in Toronto. Pai has really good pad thai, their taste of it is a little different than others, but it's over priced.

Thai ice tea is a must to order!!

I'm not 100%sure but seems like their use of meat for all the main dishes are the same frozen meat from thai express or teriyaki. Not going back for the curry but only the pai thai."}
{"text":"Probably the best place for Thai food in the city and among my favorites. However do keep in mind reservations must be reserved a minimum 24 hrs in advance because this place is ALWAYS busy.
Taking a chance and not making reservations I decided to take JC out for a nice surprise! Fortunately for us, though we did a walk-in and our wait was approximately 30 mins.
The ambiance is cozy with a few funky decor and some Thai related fixtures all over the place. While waiting at the bar for our seats we indulged in a few mini bar eats and drinks they had available:
she had the Tea Ross and I had their plum mule! both were great

For entree we ordered their:
-chicken pad thai and Khoa Soi with Beef: decadent, portions were enough and their prices are reasonable. 5/5

Pad Thai was cooked well, presentable, noodles were spectacularly soft.  Overall excellent dish! 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Solid 4/5

Its rare for me to give 4 stars out of 5 but this place deserve it. 

I tried most of their go-to dishes on the menu and I can confidently say if you don't mind the price tag, you should try as many dishes as possible because it's worth it! I was not a big fan of their famous Khao Soi or pad tai ( I mean they are still good but not mind blowing like what others said ) but I quite enjoyed everything else. 

Their green curry is not mind blowing as well but still have all the flavours that you look for when it comes to Thai curry 

My usual go to is pad gra prow with crispy pork. It's a fried rice dish with your choice of meat that's cooked with Thai basil serve with sunny side egg, cucumber and fish sauce. This dish has everything. There is tenderness of meat and crispness and juicy fat from crispy pork. Fish sauce brings all the flavours out and creamy runny egg York wraps all the flavours together. When you feel like it's little too much of fat, there is silky rice and crispy cucumber to balances out the dish. Perfect dish I'll like to have when I have a little cheat day.

Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup is another favorite of mine. Braised beef is so tender it just falls apart in your mouth. There is good balance between creaminess of peanut butter, spice, sweetness and sourness of lime. It was little bit on the heavier side than other Chiang Mai beef noodle soup I tried. Still darn good. 

If you are not into heavy dishes, just go for beef salad or papaya salad. They are very refreshing but yet has lots of flavour and quite filling. 

I took one star off because up and down of service. It's 50% chance hostess and servers will be very rude and forgetful and 50% chance they will provide the acceptional service. 

Also it's extremely busy during the dinner time so make a reservation or expect to be in the line for 30+ min. 

The place is cute and fun but to me the wait time and effy service ain't worth dine in. I highly recommend take out."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Friday and the place was absolutely packed! The place was fairly busy and rather loud but the food was extremely delicious and very flavourful! Two noteworthy starters are the spring rolls and the deep fried chicken wings - both are super crispy. In terms of the level of spicyness, I'd say not to worry too much. I generally don't tolerate spice too well, and their medium is still very approachable!

Their green curry is no longer served in a coconut but it's still delicious!"}
{"text":"So I've been here twice now, once for takeout and another dining in.

I've had the Grabong, which i think is one of the best things on the menu. Squash Fritters which are amazing. Kinda of a take on fries or rosti, but with squash.

We also ordered the papaya salad which has great flavor, two small circles of noodles which were so sticky and made me wonder why this isn't loose. Cause I'm supposed to dip it into the papaya salad and then it comes apart. There are some shrimp chips on the side which I like but not a fan of the pork grinds. This is larger than you might think. We also added the salted crab which sounds like a good idea but man those are small crab legs, so small I couldn't see it.

The pork skewers with stick rice is nice too. I really like the sticky rice, it goes great with everything.

So here's the thing, I wouldn't say I'm as in-love with the food as I was the first time I went to khao san road. However, the service is pretty good here. We were outside when i started raining and they made an effort to move the tables inside so that we could sit inside and not in the rain. Well-done!"}
{"text":"Came with a friend from London. We bought the Frits and chicken pad Thai. The pad Thai was simply amazing. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Best Thai Restaurant in the city by far. Love the Khao Soi and the Penang Curry. The Graboung is to die for. I keep going back every month for more."}
{"text":"First time having northern Thai food... at least I think so anyway. I was impressed by the flavors of the Pad Gra Prow with Tofu. The egg was a pleasant surprise and medium heat was perfect (I generally don't like intense heat). 

Patio was nice as it was a beautiful day, but beware of the car/truck noise. 

Only downside was that my tofu was a little over cooked, but didn't ruin my dish."}
{"text":"Came here today for dinner. We were in the area and decided to try Pai out after reading so many good things about it. We ordered the Chef nuir pad thai, khao soi with beef brisket, pad gra prow and sai ua platter. Everything was amazing. My friends, who do not regularly eat thai food, fell in love with this restaurant as well. The only bad thing about this place is that they are extremely busy! The wait for us to get a seat was around half an hour, and took the food another half an hour to get to our table. But it was worth the wait. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have some good news for those eagerly awaiting Jeff & Chef Nuit's latest Thai restaurant, Pai is open! 

The menu is currently abbreviated (during the soft opening stage) with a selection of her most popular dishes, but will be expanding to a full menu (and will have a liquor license) soon. 

Quality is excellent (as you'd expect if you've been to Sukho Thai, Khao San Road, or Sabai Sabai) and the flavors are authentic thai. I ordered the fried basa which now comes with a green curry sauce (which is even tastier than the tamarind sauce at Sabai). 

Excited to see the full menu get rolled out at Pai, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The place is very cute and has lovely ambience and cool music, along with an attentive and nice staff, but the food is just not good. I'm not sure why the rave reviews - maybe I ordered wrong - but while the Tom yum soup was flavorful, it was a pretty small serving for the price. The pad Ka prao with beef was recommended to me by the staff but was paradoxically both greasy and dry, the beef rather rubbery. Having traveled to Pai and extensively around Thailand, this place was a disappointment. Hope Toronto gets better Thai options if this is the best!"}
{"text":"Wow. Best Thai food I've ever had (and I've had some good Thai food!). Seriously, you gotta try this place.. The wait was about 45 minutes, but WELL worth it. My girlfriend and I just ordered a few Singhas and chilled in the waiting area, so it wasn't too shabby. We ordered the Spring Rolls to start, and the Green Curry (comes in a coconut!) as well as the Pad Gra Prow - SO GOOD, you guys. (Hint: Only order it hot if you REALLY like it spicy.) The ambience is really cool (old school rap/r&b? I'll take it!), the service is excellent, and the food is fantastic. Go here."}
{"text":"With the previous reviews, we had high expectations but were disappointed.  The pad thai was very sweet.  The tom yum soup was very salty.  The chicken curry was ok.  We drank alot of water after this meal."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and contemplating of adding more to the more than 1000 glowing reviews but I just feel I need to have a say in this restaurant too.

4 words for you - YOU SHOULD EAT HERE!

If you love good FOOD especially Thai cuisine then seriously by all means you should try PAI. I've taken more than 100 people in this restaurant including out-of-towners and recommended to families and friends. And every time they come back to thank me for introducing them to Pai.

If you're ever going to order something here, that should be the Khao Soi. 
Rich and creamy and packed with flavour from the slew of aromatics combine with tender braised beef, this is my fave dish and the one I normally order here. 

If you want a unique cold beverage, you should try their Thai iced tea. This sweet, creamy beverage is very popular in Thailand and Pai's version is so refreshing and not so sweet. 

Another dish I enjoy ordering is the Thai Fried Rice. The subtle taste of fish sauce blends nicely with the other ingredients which makes it so delish!

The restaurant ambiance is also homey and cosy and they have this one area where diners sit on cushions. Everyone from the hostess to the servers are very nice and friendly.

I would have given 5 stars but noticed that the portions have gotten smaller. Nevertheless this is still one of my fave Toronto restaurant."}
{"text":"been going to the original khao san road (now kiin) - since inception! Jeff and his wife and the sweetest, always says hi when he sees me! have  been coming to PAI for years now and i will continue to! PAI is one of my top recommendations for anyone visiting the city, it's also a regular spot for my friends and me. 

depending on my appetite and how many of us there are, we usually start with the squash fritters! they are a must, lightly battered and deep fried, service with a sweet and spicy sauce (you can ask for peanut free, if allergic). the thai chicken wings are a flavour-blast as well, just hate when dishes come in odd numbers, cause i always have to fight for the last one. it's hard to perfect wings, but chief Nuit definitely spent her time, i remember sitting at the bar when she was still testing the wings and Jeff offered me one, but i was simply too stuffed - needless to say i was very excited when it become a regular on the menu!

for entrees, it's always a dilemma for me between the pad gra pao and the street style pad pad. the pad gra pao is actually very easy to make, but hard to get the flavours/sauce right. it's one of my favourite dishes here - while the pad thai is without a doubt one of the best in Toronto. i've been to Thailand and back, can definitely say we have amazing Thai food in Toronto. their green curry, served in a coconut, is also one of my favourite curries in the city! i've also been here for a set menu, for a birthday. i believe it was $35/person, we of course, ordered alcohol. there were 2-3 apps and 3 entrees, PLUS desserts. needless to say we all left extremely satisfied and some with take out, highly recommend. i love coming with a big group or even up to 4 people - always us to order everything simultaneously. 

i have yet to try kiin, but definitely had heard great things! will probably go try it soon. 

definitely a must try for anyone who hasn't been and a regular spot for all locals."}
{"text":"We had to order in because of a long day and had  toddlers for company. Got foreigner spicy papaya salad-nailed it, mushroom  spring rolls-decadent, massaman curry- delicious and the thai spicy pad thai which was simply glorious. I'm drooling again just writing this review.  Not really street style , but can't go wrong if you enjoy good thai food."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious food! The menu is simple but everything they do is really good. You can choose how spicy you want it so that is also a plus.

Best rice I have ever had...

I would say it's a perfect Thai place even for those who think Thai food is too spicy..it isn't. Try it and you'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants I've eaten at in TO. 

My gf and I ate: Kah Soi which was a chicken curry noodle dish, papaya salad with crab and morning glory (green shoot vegetables). 

The Kah Soi was FANTASTIC. Such a nice rich curry flavored sauce/soup almost. The papaya salad was delicious and nicely spicy. The morning glory was a nice refreshing change to what can often be a bit of a boring dish.  It was nicely seasoned with shrimp paste and garlic. 

Love this place. Will def go back. 

(We ordered delivery)"}
{"text":"Been here many times before and after going to Crocodile Rock. There's a good amount of flavor in each bite of their Pad Thai. Between Pai,Sukho Thai and KSR, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I thought I posted a review, but apparently not! This is definitely a great place for lunch as well as a date / friends night out. Prices are a bit pricey, but the quality and quantity of food is decent. They are almost always packed during the busy times, so either go a bit earlier or a bit later for lunch. I wouldn't really recommend Pai for more than a party of 4 people as the tables aren't really suited for larger party sizes. For lunch, you can head over to the Pai market (head towards the washroom area) and you can have their dish of the day.

I have not had a bad dish here, but I would definitely recommend the Gaeng Massaman or the Kao Soi. But their pad thai is pretty good alongside of the Gang Kiaw Wan (it's curry...served in a coconut, which is a pretty popular dish).

Service: 4/5
Food: 5/5 (was...cooked enough, i think?)
Price: 4/5

Overall: 4.5 / 5 (Their dishes are always consistent and the kitchen is super efficient.)"}
{"text":"One word - AMAZING!!  We have ordered from here so often that we have had every dish on their menu and I can honestly say that everything is delicious. Our favourites are: their fried fish (they make it with the batter so light and fried to perfection that the fish remains flaky and just delish); pad thai (absolutely no ketchup here and always leaves me craving more); beef brisket (perfect combo of spice to sweetness); beef salad (OMG refreshing and delicious); and pork satays (made with oyster sauce these morsels of pork are so addictive I could eat the entire order myself)."}
{"text":"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is one of the Entertainment District's newest arrivals, and the brainchild of Gusto 101's Janet Zuccarini and Nuit and Jeff Regular. This restaurant, which is tucked away from the chaotic King street crowd onto Duncan street (South of Adelaide), maintains an underground aura (quite literally, too) with beautiful, quaint, and cozy decor. 

Notwithstanding the question of \"authenticity,\" which is somewhat raised by the hipster-y crowd, I was thoroughly impressed with my chicken pad thai. I also got a good chuckle out of the \"spiciness\" scale, which includes a \"foreigner\" level for those who can tolerate the heat but maybe not to the same degree of those who hail from Thailand. The presentation of the meal was absolutely perfect, even though it lacked a bit of sweetness. Also, the noodles weren't overly saturated in peanuts, which was a plus for me.

I washed down my meal with a drink called \"Amir Johnson\" (and yes, it was named after Toronto Raptor power forward/centre player). This cocktail was packed with a punch in the form of scotch and amaretto, which beautifully complemented and neutralized the spice of the pad thai. 

A friendly tip: it's safe to come here in a party of two, as many of the tables are configured to seat that many people at any given time. If you come here with a party of 3+, you might have to wait a while to be seated. In the event of the latter, you might luck out and get the table where you are obliged to take off your shoes and are surrounded by a cavalcade of colourful pillows."}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday evening. It was super busy, had to wait 35 minutes to get a table. There is a cozy corner inside the restaurant for waiting, good for winter time. The waiting was worth it. Despite the extreme busyness, drink was served on time. I had ordered Tom Yum Caesar. It was a bit spicy and had the expected punch. Loved it. 

The food tasted great. We had tried Pad Gra Prow with chicken and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. Both dishes were very flavourful. I order mine to make Thai spicy. Bad decision! It was super hot (spicy). If you can't handle spice but would like to try anyway then I would suggest you rather go for mild or foreigner spicy. The portion was moderate. The taste of both dishes were very similar to the same dishes in BKK Thai at North York where I am a regular. If you happen to be in this corner (just North of 401 on Yonge, North York) of the city, I suggest you also try BKK Thai. There food is equally good or better minus the crowd and waiting time. Anyway, it's not as vibrant as Pai and one tenth in size.

Overall the service was great. Can't ask for more in such a busy time. Glasses of water were served and refilled without asking. Highly appreciated the extra paper napkins on the table; proactive thinking - guests will need them specially if they try their food Thai spicy. I would love to go there again with a big group."}
{"text":"Pretty good service from servers.
Tasty peanut sauce in beef stew noodle. Paitai was also good but that Thai salad with betel leaves was most unique.
Long wait since we arrived peak time. I couldn't understand why people lined up on a Monday night to eat there till I ate that cold dish.
The raw salad ingredients included garlic, lime, red pepper, green hot pepper, fresh chopped peanuts, sweet and sour sauce plus petite shrimps, wrapped in dark green leaves.
It's the first time I saw that dish in FL or CA."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for Thai food. The Khao Soi was so flavourful. The ambience was rustic and warm."}
{"text":"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is one of the most popular Thai restaurants in Toronto and the restaurant won few awards from the NOW Magazine (2014 ~ 2016 Readers' Choice Runner-Up). Chef Nuit Regular also own three other sister restaurants (Sukho Thai, Kiin, and Sabai Sabai).

Parking is not fun in downtorn Toronto, but I managed to find a lot about 4~5 blocks away. Our party got here at 6:45 PM and the hostess said the waiting time is approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour. I put my number down so that they can text me when our table is ready, but I started to get a bit anxious because I wasn't too sure whether I would actually get a text via data roaming (using US number in Canada) and my friend had delayed texts during this Toronto trip. Luckily one of my friends was able to utilize his unparalleled soft skill by talking to the hostess after we waiting about 30 minutes and somehow he was able to get our party a table immediately afterward.

The menu selection reminds me a lot of Pok Pok (a very popular Thai restaurant in Portland). You will find mostly Norther Thai cuisine and no pad see ew is on the menu (I didn't even notice until one of my friends mentioned about it). I still somewhat questioned why one of my friends ordered Pad Thai when that's not even on one of Yelp's highlights, oh well.

***

Grabong (freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts - CAD $13): Squash fritters were lightly fried and they didn't even taste like squash (more like sweet potato). Oh man that sweet and spicy dipping sauce tasted extremely addicting. This is a must order dish.

Pad Gra Prow with Crispy Pork (Moo Grob) (holy basil stir fried served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a Thai style fried egg + nam prik nam pla sauce [fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime] - medium spicy, CAD $17.5): WARNING - If you don't like fish sauce, then you will NOT like this dish. Luckily I like fish sauce and this rice dish tasted a bit like a Thai version of Taiwanese minced pork rice with an egg. Medium spicy wasn't very spicy. It was a very delicious dish and I also recommend this dish too!

Thai Iced Tea (CAD $5.50): Maybe I was pretty thirsty, but that was one good Thai tea. I probably finished the drink in less than 1 minutes.

***

EXCELLENT Thai food - good enough to compete against some of my favorite Thai restaurants in Los Angeles (e.g. Daisy Mint in Pasadena, CA). I wouldn't mind waiting for a hour if I am coming back here again."}
{"text":"Incredible ambience with some great drinks and fantastic food. 
Had the khao suey ,the chicken green curry and the penang curry. Had no complaints. Food was flavourful and cooked perfectly. Ordered the caeser to drink as Pai is very famous for it and now I understand why."}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing food, great atmosphere, friendly and efficient staff. Really like it.
The only thing that made me knock down one star is that sometimes they're a victim of their own success and it can be a little bit disorganized in terms of getting the tables cleaned up and turned around, which means sometimes you'll have to wait a bit for a table that is actually already free but just wasn't set up yet. But hey, once you get the table, you're in for amazing food, and it will arrive quickly and it will amaze you, so it's totally worth the wait.

Try the massaman beef, it's outstanding."}
{"text":"Clearly mine and Hubby's favourite Thai place right now. I come in quite often for take out. Please try the Pad Grow Prow with crispy pork. It is the best dish, can't  describe how good it is but trust me. And if you like spicy, Thai spicy is the way to go! The Khao Soi with braised beef was also delicious and broth not too heavy. Don't leave without having the sticky rice mango for dessert. It is delicious! Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite Thai place in Scarborough. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but once you are inside, the decor and atmosphere instantly make you feel like you've been transported to a local eatery in Thailand. As for the dishes, my go to appetizer is the chicken toast. It's crunchy and savoury but perfectly paired with the sweet dipping sauce. PadPrik chicken with rice is the perfect amount of spicy and just so amazing-a must try. The pad Thai here is also delicious and generous in portion size!"}
{"text":"I've been lusting after this place for months and lucky enough today was my chance to try it out.  I went for lunch with a friend and there was a small wait.  This place is in the Financial District so I think it's aiming to grab the suits and serve up quick lunches - quick turnover equals more money.  Kinda like an upscale-ish hole in the wall.  

It's a decent size but they pack in the tables so you feel like you are sitting in your neighbour's lap (hopefully they are good looking), but it lends to the good vibes in here. 

The drinks are unique and interesting but slightly pricey for what you get, but I guess the price is ok for the area.

Originally we were told a 20 min wait but it ended up being only about 6-7 min wait and we were able to order drinks at the bar.  We both had the beef curry (massaman curry).  I chose medium spicy but honestly I didn't find it that spicy - a nice little hint of heat with a soft hint of sweetness.  It was delicious. The food comes quickly so if you are on your lunch you should be good to eat and run."}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant. Waited around 5 minutes to be seated and another 20 minutes for the food to come but the wait was not bad at all. Ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai w/ Chicken and I absolutely loved it! \"Foreigner spicy\" added a great taste. Ambience and decor of the restaurant was unique and lively, and our server was very friendly. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"We were here last night, catching up with some old friends!  The ambience is casual and this place was totally busy.  I recommend making a reservation (which they accept)  Woot!

We had the spring rolls, squash fritters and morning glory? (a fabulously delicious green vegetable dish) to start, they were all fantastic.

I ordered Phad Sol?  I should take pictures of the menu.  It was a rice noodle dish in yellow curry and totally delicious.

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food but I wish they would scrape the meat out of the coconut before serving the green curry in it. Seems like a horrible waste especially since coconuts are not very eco friendly to grow in the first place"}
{"text":"One word: YUM. 

My friend and I walked in just before it got super busy and we were promptly seated. We asked for Thai iced tea and it came in minutes. I wish there was more tea and a bit less of the ice! I think Khao San Road has better Thai iced tea. 

I ordered the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup in medium hot. It was just an explosion of flavours; spicy, sweet, sour, savouriness all in one. The beef was super soft and the noodles were just perfect. The peanuts gave it great texture and another level of flavour.  Honestly it was a little bit too spicy for me, but it was still extremely delicious. Just what I needed for a chilly day. My belly is still warm from it 6 hours later. 

Would definitely recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Food here is rich, authentic, and bursting with flavour. I'm never disappointed when I come here. Definitely order the Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"The decor and plates reminded me of my grandparents place growing up.  Amazing space and music.  Food wise it's really good... comfort food at its best. I always get the khao soi  smoothness  and intense flavor marrying into one amazing dish and add to it amazing texture.  Also you should get Thai iced tea it's a must.  I'm giving it 5 stars maybe because it reminds me of my childhood... and that's good enough reason."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I came here for a late dinner after the Jays/Red Sox game.  We walked in around 9:30 p.m and had to wait about five minutes for a table to be cleaned off for us. The restaurant really has a warm and cozy atmosphere but it is pretty small and you are sitting about a foot and a half away from the people at the next table so it gets loud. You may as well be sitting at the same table. When we went, it was pretty full. Not crowded, but I think there were only one or two empty tables in there. We found ourselves almost yelling when we were trying to talk because it does get pretty loud inside and you have to compete with other people yelling and talking really loudly. This is no fault of the restaurant and it's one of those things that you just have to deal with when you go to a popular restaurant so we were fine with it.

As far as the food goes, my fiancee's pad thai was very very good. It has a unique flavoring to it while still maintaining the traditional pad thai taste that we all know so well.  I had the chiang mai beef noodle soup w/ peanuts and it was delicious. I highly recommend both dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! The portions are average-sized, and the entrees range from $15-19. The waiter recommended some dishes to us, and I took his suggestion and ordered the Pad Gra Prow with Chicken, Farang Spicy (other options were mild, medium, and thai spicy). As the waiter explained, thai spicy is a notch above farang spicy and tl;dr you gotta be pretty confident in your spice tolerance! My personal tolerance is pretty high, and I thought farang spicy was perfect, so use that as reference. The fried egg that was placed on top of the egg was really unique and delicious; the whites were super crispy, while the yolk was easy/medium. I also tasted their Pad Thai, which was different from anything I've ever had before and absolutely amazing.

You also may want to make a reservation since the place is very popular, although I didn't have to use my reservation when I showed up around 1 PM."}
{"text":"After seeing multiple check ins from friends waited 1 hr to be seated for dinner. Ordered the Lowry at the bar which was really good. Food was amazing. Ordered pad thai, green curry, khao soi, braised beef. Service was great: from the host to the bar tender to the waitress."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch takeout. Got a pad Thai with chicken. Took about 20 mins to prepare. Good service overall. Food was great! Definitely lived up to their reputation. Portion size was good as well."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait!!!

I believe we waited about 30-45 minutes for just us two people. They served us drinks at the bar side table. 

We got sat down at the back of the restaurant and might I say.... THIS RESTAURANT IS HUGE!!!!! 

We ordered the famous cold dish that wraps the betel leaf with garlic, shallots, ginger. Pomelo, peanuts, lime and spicy chili. Added with that is roasted or toasted coconut shred and it was so good! Value $15.

Then the green curry was absolutely amazing. It came in a coconut which was so cool! 
It tasted less salty than usual places which is great for me. But it was real spicy! So good though. I must come back to try more food!!!"}
{"text":"Came here during a weekday for lunch. There was a bit of a wait but it wasn't very long, maybe around 10-15minutes to get a table for two. When me and my friend sat down, it took a while to get service from our server. Our first server came to ask us for drinks and we requested water but the water never came until we waived the server again.

We placed our orders for spring rolls, kung tawt, tom yum soup, pad thai, and fried fish. The appetizers were great, especially the kung tawt. It wasn't overly battered and I love the sauce that it comes with. These are highly additive! Moreover, the tom yum soup was nice. I thought the spring rolls were okay, I probably wouldn't order this again. 

Onto the entrees. I love the pad thai, it was tasty but I was expecting more given the high reviews. Don't get me wrong, it was great but it did not wow me. The fried fish was good with the curry that it comes with. Again, nothing from the entrees ordered really wowed me. 

Overall, PAI has good thai food. However, the service was really disappointing. I had to go through 3 different servers to request for chili flakes. (Me and my friend asked two servers for chili flakes but they never came with it, until we reached our third server) Our entrees were getting cold as we wait for the chili flakes."}
{"text":"SOOO good! If you're gluten-free, though, remember that even though it says items can be made gluten-free, that you have to request that to be done. They do not come automatically that way, always. Will return."}
{"text":"The food is 5 star! The price is 5 star! I got the pad thai and loved it! It is way better than Khao San Road in my opinion. The portion is large for the price you pay. The downside is the wait time, tooooo long even after they sat us down. Especially when you are hungry and you watch other people get their food and everything smells awesome. Excruciating. The place is cramped, ther's barely any space between tables. Not a good date place choice but if you are here for the food, definitely worth it. Next time I may try order take out."}
{"text":"If I could only eat one cuisine for the rest of my life, it'd be Thai food. And with Khao San Road closed for renovation and Pai just a couple blocks from my home, this is definitely a place I frequent regularly. 

There's often a line-up, but they recently expanded so the last few times I haven't had to wait, which is great! It's a very casual, energetic vibe and can be quite noisy during busy times, but I don't mind. The service is okay. Not super attentive and sometimes slow, but I know, they're busy, so it's fine. The servers are friendly enough.

I can't say anything bad about their Pad Thai - I order it every time. It's probably my favourite Pad Thai in Toronto. The Chiang mai beef noodle soup is great as well. The soup is flavourful with spices and the beef is nice and tender. It's never piping hot though. Same with the tom yum soup with shrimp - it's not steaming hot when it comes out (even though it comes in a metal pot with a candle underneath to keep it warm). But it's delicious.

I do wish that Pai had a red or panang curry - curry is my love. They do have a green curry served in a coconut, which is okay but not my favourite. I find the coconut to be a bit gimmicky and I don't really like when I stick my spoon in the coconut and end up scraping off a chunk of coconut meat. I do LOVE their massaman curry, though - the beef and potato chunks are tender and the gravy is delicious. The curry comes with a bowl of rice, which is the perfect vehicle for consuming all of the gravy.

I feel happy and satisfied every time I eat here. Always a good experience!"}
{"text":"Came here while in Toronto for a conference. Managed to get a table on Sunday night without any wait but the place was definitely busy and there was a line out the door by the time we left.

Ordered the Khao Soi with drumsticks and it was phenomenal. Enjoyed my dinner with a Moscow Mule as well. Overall, a very good eat in a fun space.

Can be crowded and can get quite loud when it's busy. But overall, well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I've been a loyal patron of Chef Nuit and Jeff's restaurants for many many years, and that this 3 star rating is probably a one-off that will not deter me from going back and trying Pai again.

Expectations for Chef Nuit and Jeff's restaurants are always high for me ever since my first meal at the original Sukhothai. So when I heard they were opening a new restaurants literally blocks away from where I live, I knew I had to check it out.

When you go to a restaurant within their first few days of opening you have to expect that there will be kinks that need to be worked out as they get into the groove of having a new space, menu, and patronage.

I came in maybe a quarter to closing (10pm), and they were more than happy to accomodate me and my friends for dinner, which wasn't easy to do, since even at closing, the restaurant was packed!

I was looking forward to having a beer, but unfortunately they hadn't been able to obtain their liquor license yet. Which is fine and in no part their fault. I was happy enough to have get the thai ice tea.

For food, we ordered the Tom Yum Soup, Pad Thai, Papaya Salad with salted crab, and Gaeng Hunglay (Pork Belly Curry). For the Gaeng Hunglay, they ran out of the pork belly and had to substitute it with Ox tail, and for the papaya salad, they ran out of the pork rinds that accompany it. Unfortunate again, but it was near the end of service.

The Tom Yum Soup was everything we expected and as good as it always is.

The Pad Thai for me could have used a little more tamirand. I felt sukhothai's pad thai is better, but my friend thought it was every bit as good as sukhothai's so maybe it's just me.

The Gaeng Hunglay with oxtail was tasty, and the oxtail was nice and tender. no complaints there, but I look forward to trying the pork belly next time.

The papaya salad was a bit of a letdown. The salted crabs were a great addition, as it's very reminicent of the street food that you would get in the thailand, vietnam, or laos area. Not something you get very often here in Toronto. I would have liked there to have been more crab to compliment the papaya salad instead of only getting a small taste of it every now and then. The other thing about the papaya salad was the way it was presented. It was kind of deconstructed on a large platter, with the vermicelli noodles on the side which made it a bit disjointed. Take a look at the pictures and maybe it'll make more sense. It seemed like it needed to be mixed, but was it supposed to be mixed on the platter? or our plates? Also because there wasn't any pork rinds they added more vermicelli, which made it a bit off balance as well. Personally, I probably won't be getting this again.

So, all in all, it was alright, but I know it could be (and probably is) better than what I had that one night. Chef Nuit makes some of the best thai food in the city, so I'll be back again, and I'll be sure to update my review and rating when I do"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai. 

Really enjoyed the food here it tasted very similar to the food we had in Bangkok. Over all very tasty and definitely one of the best Thai places in Toronto"}
{"text":"This place is totally bumpin.  It's loud and the atmosphere is is perfect for a weekend dinner with friends.  It is also very, very busy here!  Be prepared to wait.

I had the laap salad to start, khao soi with braised beef as my main and a mango smoothie to wash everything down.  I saw lots of people around me order the grabong as a starter, which is the deep fried squash and I regret not getting that as well.  The laap salad was okay.  I think I expected something different (ie. something similar to the larb salad at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas).  I wouldn't order the laap salad again.  The khao soi was amazing.  It was creamy, delicious and perfectly seasoned.  I could eat that over and over again.  I was stuffed and didn't save room for dessert but I would've loved to try the mango sticky rice!  

This place is a solid choice for thai food."}
{"text":"Good Thai restaurant in core downtown Toronto - like the street food feel like dining space."}
{"text":"Luckily, I got here at 11am, as soon as it opens, because it fills up super fast. The ambiance is so cute and the food is just as good (which means it's amazing!!). I had the pad thai which was flavourful and really hit the spot. 

This is hands down my go-to place for Thai in the city. Will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Seriously so good- every experience has been amazing! Not much to write about other than to go try it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but personally it doesn't add up to the hype for me. Everyone told me how amazing the food is but for me, the food is a bit too heavy for my stomach to handle. Location is tucked away in this underground \"hipster\" like area. Very packed! We waited approx. 20 minutes and wait staff was hard to call but totally understandable. The vibe wasn't very \"thai\" though; it felt very similar to Warehouse on Queen. 

I went with my boyfriend, I got the curry noodles and he got this extremely spicy rice dish (forgot the name of both but they were supposedly verh popular dishes) Also ordered a tom yum soup and a Thai milk tea. Dishes were served  pretty fast but the workers seem to be overworked :( . The curry noodles were delicious, came with fried crisps but after about 6 bites you get sick of it since it is very very rich. I packed the rest up. My boyfriends rice wasn't really interesting in flavor, just really spicy. He said the Tom yum soup didn't taste right either so he didn't end up finishing it. The milk tea was very very good though, edging on very sweet but overall would recommend.

Overall the experience was ok. We only stayed for 20 minutes after ordering since we couldn't handle the food, my boyfriend ended up getting sick from it when we went home. Would not recommend if youre looking for a light meal or if you have a weak stomach."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the city!

In fact, if I could, I'd give Pai a 10 star rating! I've enjoyed many meals at this delicious restaurant, my favourite being the green curry. I have NEVER been let down. 

This place is definitely a spot you want to go a little before you're hungry, though - there is always a wait! But deservingly so! Once you get your name put down on the wait list, they allow you to grab a drink at the bar. I always dive into the culture in which I'm about to eat, and man their Thai beer is good! It's called Singha, which is an easy drinking lager. 

Service has always been amazing here. And the decor is AMAZING! It's tucked away underground and is deceivingly large! Seriously, the restaurant just keeps going! The music is always great and actually has great sound (the perfect amount of bass... not that treble-y crap you hear at some restaurants). This is a place you can come with any kind of company and have fun!

And ps - they participate in UberEATS, guys!
(This place is my guilty pleasure when I'm hungover and on the couch, ha)."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here a few days ago - the Golden Curry. Magical. This is our new go to Thai spot; surprised we didn't stumble on it sooner. Big ups to the pad Thai and salads as well. In a sea of options serving noodles in sweet ketchup and frozen spring rolls, Pai is truly glorious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, the Pad Thai and Pad Gra Prow are very good.

Overall it's very tasty, but popular. So seating a group on short notice is a problem. 

Also it's on Ritual, so you can get take out easily."}
{"text":"If you've been to Khao San Road or Nana and liked it, this place is right up your alley. Also all run by the same guy so no surprise there! Great variety of flavours and dishes for sharing as well as tasty appetizers and strong, delicious cocktails! 

In an area that doesn't have too many great food options unless you want burritos or overpriced pub food, Pai is a breath of fresh air! This place offers a casual atmosphere with cool decor and friendly staff. 

Try not to sit too close to the door in wintertime though - cold air blows right through! Also a good idea to make a reservation as it gets really busy during prime time dinner and weekend hours."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 

Favourite thai place in Toronto. I came back with a few coworkers and decided to try the green curry, and the squash fritters. We all loved the squash fritters. Easily enough for 4 people. The tamarind sauce that comes with it is sweet and tangy - goes really well with the fritters. 

The green curry was amazing. Served in a coconut with a side of rice. The curry was sweet, a little spicy and perfectly creamy. Vegetables were still a little crunchy and a few tofu pieces. 

Service was friendly and quick, although we came in around 5PM. Highly recommend coming in or making a reservation the day before! 

 
This place fills up fast! Luckily I got here and got a seat with my friend at the bar! We got the sake bombs which I highly recommend them if you want to get decently drunk. I also the pad Thai which was pretty delicious. 

What I loved was the service. The bartender and server were very nice and we got our Food pretty quickly, which was awesome."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of Pai.

We arrived 8 PM on a Saturday, no reservation. A risky situation, only to be made worse by the fact that their kitchen closed early for an event that night (9:30). We were told there was an hour+ wait, and there was a chance we might not get a table even if we waited. 

Being downtown, I probably could've used my time better and went to one of the other billion restaurants in the city, but every single time I've visited Toronto trying to get some khao soi and squash fritters, I've been denied for one reason or another (mostly my fault, I try to go on Sundays like a dumbass when most Thai restaurants are closed). 

WELL NOT TODAY. I drove downtown for some fucking khao soi, I better get some fucking khao soi. So I toughed it out, put my name down, walked around the block several times and returned around 9:20. As luck would have it, they called us for the LAST table they would serve that night. And it was totally worth the wait.

We squeezed our order in and they served it up pretty fast. I inhaled my khao soi. The curry, the noodles, the meat. It was on point. The squash fritters were just OK, they're like less sweet sweet potato fries. I built them up too high in my head after years of drooling at IG pics from places like Khao San Road/Sukho Thai. The khao soi though is the bomb, and that alone is worth a return."}
{"text":"Staying around the downtown core really has it's benefits.  One of them, is that you get to try all the modern and trendy restaurants that are making waves in the community.  Good friend of mines mentioned that this place would be amazing, and after experiencing the food myself, I have to say that it is pretty stellar.  I have been to quite a few thai resturants in my lifetime as well as travelled to Thailand quite a few times and will validate the authenticity of the food here is pretty much as good as you can get in Toronto.  

One thing to note is that this place is always busy and you are going to be expected to wait at least 30-40 mins if you do not beat the rush after work that comes down here to experience the vibes of this place.  The neat thing is that they have a waiting area/bar that you can chill in an have drinks, until a spot becomes available as well as seats to rest if you need it after a long day of work.  Friends and I were lucky and only waited 15 mins or so before they opened the back (I heard it only opens after a certain period of time) and we got to go in.

We had a few appetizers which included the lemongrass chicken wings and I had my rice with egg and crispy pork which I think was a good choice in hindsight.  Their pork skewers were also amazing and probably won the appetizer of the night as we had a few and probably one of the better skewers I have ever had.  Overall, the vibes were nice, service was good and food was great and hence, will definitely come back to try the many different things on their menu.  

On a side note, relatively on the expensive side for Thai food, but I guess you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"Pros: pad Thai choices, variety, staff, taste

Cons: busy and cramped depending when you go

Summary: worth going if you like pad thai! :)"}
{"text":"I went to there around 2p.m. but there were still many people inside!! The food was reaaally delicious!! Although the seats were a little crowded... The distance between every table was very small that I can hear about other people's talking ( sorry about that, I was not deliberated..) However, the stuff were all very nice. One girl asked us about the taste and even helped to adjust the spice degree of my friend's curry. 

Ok, the most important thing should still be the food, right? We ordered a Pad Thai with shrimp, a bowl of Tum Yum soup and a chicken curry. 
--The pad thai with sweet and sour sauce was the best! The peanut made it very aromatic and I love it so much! 
--Tum yum soup was much sour but I enjoyed it too. BTW, there were many shrimps in a small bowl.
--Curry with the Thai spice was a little spicy for my friend but just suited for me.. Definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Toronto!

I grew up in Thailand, therefore I am always looking for some good authentic food in Canada and this is it. It is special because they serve Northern style Thai food and the interior of this place was spot on. There is Thai writing on the walls and the bathroom signs, the classic Thai blue tarps, metal stools, Thai flags etc. And all this makes me feel like I'm back at home. I went on a weekday afternoon in March and there was no wait and we were able to get a table for 5 easily.

I ordered my favourite dish, Khao Soy (which is noodles in yellow curry soup and chicken) and it was absolutely delicious. It comes with several toppings which was great because I could add more spice to it. I also got the Thai Iced Tea which is milky, sweet and ice cold. It was a good combo with the hot, spicy and sweet and cold. I also got a taste of all my friends' dishes such as the Pad kra pao (minced beef with basil), the satay sticks and the pad thai which were all equally as delicious. 

To top it off, they sell authentic Thai beers like Chang and Singha! 

\"Pai\" in thai means \"go\", so I definitely recommend you go and try it out."}
{"text":"Most unique Thai restaurant I have ever been to not just in Toronto but ever! If you get a chance to while you wait to be seated, check out the story of how the restaurant was started, great stuff. 

I would advise calling to make a reservation, the place was super busy (even on a Thursday night). 

Once seated, we ordered the fried butternut squash and chicken wings, I could eat the fried squash everyday for the rest of my life. It was so freaking darn good. For the main course, we tried the pad Thai and the green curry, I thought the pad Thai was a little light on flavoring and the green curry was lukewarm. I think due to the crazy dinner rush, they got a little sloppy on the prep but the items tasted great.

Finally, the drinks here are off the hook! I recommend the sangria, light and refreshing! Mmm mmm mmm! Butternut squash and sangria!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food and great service.  Everything is authentic and fresh.  Thanks to Jeff and his team for a wonderful experience and a memorable meal."}
{"text":"A dark, hectic, loud basement that is surprisingly large. Service is excellent and when it's busy you have the choice of a shared table which adds to the communal experience.

There could be a wait but there is a holding bar so it's not so bad. Bottom line, food is absolutely spectacular. Most other reviewers seem to agree so I won't go on.  A must if you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food was amaaaaazing. We started off with the best chicken skewers ever. The meat was sooooooooo tender (not sure how they do it) and charred to the right amount.  It came with satay sauce which is the bomb, and also a vinaigrette if you prefer something lighter in between. 

For the main, we ordered the Khao Soi and Pad Thai. Where do I begin, I have never had Khao Soi before, it is egg noodle in a cocounut curry sauce. This was soooo yummy I am still thinking about it. I couldn't stop drinking the soup and the noodles soaked in the flavours. 
So. good. 
Comparatively, the pad thai lost it's luster, but don't get me wrong, it was still really good. We ordered spiciness of medium but it was more like a mild mild. 

This restaurant is always hustling and bustling, so expect a wait time. The turnover is actually quite fast and the space is bigger than it seems. 

Will definitely be back if in the area!"}
{"text":"There's always a line up at Pai, and that's for good reason: the food is just amazing! Luckily, we didn't have to line up because we made a reservation (over a month in advance).

The menu is extensive and offers a great variety of drinks and authentic Thai food. My favourite dish here has got to be the Pad Thai, but you can't go wrong with the Khao Soi or curry dishes either. 

The atmosphere is lively, although it could be a bit loud. The service is very good as well. 

If you happen to be in the financial district, Pai is a fantastic place to catch up with someone over dinner, get to know somebody better, or just grab some food with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I have to say coming from NY, being Thai and missing home cooking. Toronto is the last place I thought I'd find good tasting authentic Thai food. I've been a lot of places and the Thai food never cuts its. Either too \"Farang\", too bland, near tasteless food is served. I walked into Pai expecting the same. Having been to the town of Pai it was awesome to walk into the restaurant full of decor. We ordered the larb, which was delicious with the added pork rine and the satay, which was also marinated right and grilled very well. Delightful appetizers. I usually judge Thai restaurants on how they make their masaman curry. With Pai that was no exception. My wife ordered the boat noodle soup The Masaman was creamy and peanut-licious. and the boat noodles had the right blend of sweet sour spice and savory. I would highly recommend \"Pai\" to anyone. Coming from a Thai person who is hard to please with Thai food. I cannot say how lucky you Torontonians have it. A true gem of a restaurant"}
{"text":"There is an obvious disconnect between this place and me as oppose to many others. However, as with the many examples of successful ethnic eateries as of late; the key to raving reviews is really approach-ability. The recipe for success goes something like this; take some average Thai food, plate it fancily, dim the lights, make the space warm, rustic and industrial AND lastly turn up the music. I can't say this food is bad nor is it delicious though the curry is quite adequate. However, considering the price I had to pay I would say they have woefully underachieved.

Let's start with the classic Pad Thai -- the dish that is fried rice is to Chinese food, sushi is to Japanese food...etc. If there is one dish to be done right, it would be this. It was quite a disappointment to say the least, probably one of the most amateur interpretations I've had. The noodles have been chopped up too short and have become \"clumpy\" (they've overcooked it and when you do that the noodles tend to break up and clump up during the stir fry process). The flavours were extremely muted and it was as bland in both presentation and taste as you can imagine it. Luckily, we had an assortment of curries and for the most part they did a good job on the sauce itself. What was disappointing was the dry unflavourful proteins and absence of any sort of substantial vegetables to add some pop and freshness to the dishes. Do note that the curries taste very similar so it may not make a difference which one you pick; so just get it in your favourite colour? There are reasons why curries come in different colours and it's not just to please your eyes. Those wings, those tiny wings that cost almost a buck and half each were awfully over-hyped. They were tender but that's about where it ends. I couldn't make out what flavours they were; it was like a mis-mash of various random spices and herbs that equate to not very memorable, confusing and strange tasting wings. I guess there was a hint of lemongrass in it and that was nice. I've saved the best for last and it was the tom yum soup. Everything was on point except for the oddly sized pieces of lemon grass it comes with. Not quite small enough to ignore yet not quite big enough to be easily removed. If anyone has chewed on lemongrass, you will understand how pleasant it can be.

So behind all the smoke and hype, behind all that hippy, happy, lounge-y vibe what you have is an overpriced and mediocre meal."}
{"text":"We came here fairly late (after 9pm) on a Saturday night so the wait to get a table and food was not long.
The place is busy and the atmosphere is young. 
Service was good and attentive. Food was very good.
We got a Chef Nuit Pad Thai with shrimp which was very good and we highly recommend it and a Khoa Soi with chicken (picture below) which was also very good. 
Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a thursday night around 6pm. As expected, it was super packed. Waited for about 45min. I recommend getting the squash fries and the northern market rice pork dish. I loved it. I've never been to Thailand, nor am i Thai, so not sure if this is real real thai food, but it tasted super amazing!! I guarantee you'll feel full after this, you might not even be able to finish. If you can reserve, please do!"}
{"text":"Known to be one of the top Thai places in Toronto, it did not disappoint. In addition to the menu of Thai classics, Pat has an area for quick-serve dishes that are great for people looking for a fast grab and go.

Great food, excellent service and interesting decor. The only area of concern is the pricing, which runs higher than expected. Guess that's downtown for ya! (The minimum wage hike probably didn't help either)."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE FOOD HERE. I would give this place a 5-star if the wait wasn't so long.

What we had: pad thai, khao soi, pad gra prow, green curry (this was over multiple visits, we don't eat THAT much)

Taste: 10/10

I love the pad thai here. It's so flavourful, it's salty, sour, sweet, and spicy and their use of chives really complements everything. I usually get it with beef or shrimp. It tastes different with chicken, I tried it once with chicken and prefer beef or shrimp.

I found the khao soi kind of gimmicky. It was very heavy, the beef wasn't particularly tender, was kind of overcooked. The crunchy noodles were interesting but at the end of the day it's just fried noodles with boiled noodles and overcooked beef in a heavy peanut soup. I would not get this again.

The pad gra prow here is super tasty. This is my favourite dish from Pai right now. I tried it with pork, chicken, and beef. It tastes best with chicken; it really brings out the flavour of the sauce. Depending on the type of meat you get, this dish could taste vastly different. It's topped with a sunny side up egg, which multiplies the yum factor by 1203980954798. I usually don't like eating rice but I have trouble holding back from practically inhaling this dish.

The green curry is fragrant, and it's not overwhelmed with coconut milk. The flavours of the spices really shine. If you get this for dinner, it comes inside a coconut which is cute. Would highly recommend if you like curry dishes.

Value: 5/10

Steven usually can't get full from a main dish here. It wouldn't hurt if they increased their portions... most of their ingredients are inexpensive, like rice and noodles... 

** Average cost per diner: $20 after tax and tip (just mains, nothing else)

Service/Convenience: 2/10

Eating here is super inconvenient and you have to have the patience of a saint. First there's a line... to get a spot in line in their system. Then when you're on the official line, you wait until they call/text you to get a seat. Once you are seated and you place your order, it takes a long time for your order to arrive. We've timed it once. Our food took 40 minutes to come. I strongly recommend just getting take out...

Also, you cannot make reservations on the same day so if you want to reserve, do it well in advance!

Would go back? Maybe when the line-up is not so long once in a blue moon.

Would recommend to friend? Yes but would recommend they get take out.

Similar places: SukhoThai but then again they're by the same owners

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"As someone who is very familiar with street food in Bangkok, I could say that Pai is the closest one could get to authentic thai street food in Toronto. 

Coming from the east end, I am extremely disappointed with the Thai selection in Scarborough or North York. In these parts, Thai restaurants are usually run by Chinese people who serve Ketchup pad Thai and watery green curry. So I go downtown when I can for my Thai food fix.

I find their lunch specials to be of good value. I usually judge how good a Thai restaurant is from two dishes: the Panang curry and the krapow. This place serves both and exceptionally well. Portions are just right, but the flavour is THERE. And that's all that matters. Just the right amount of spice, and the ingredients are really fresh. 

Don't let its location in the heart of the financial/entertainment district turn you off. This is more authentic Thai than anywhere in the Spadina strip. 

I would give this an \"A\" to \"A+\" in my book. I wish the pad Thai was slightly less sweet and they could turn down a notch the slight hipster ambience and give it more like an actual Soi Sukhumvit street vibe."}
{"text":"Environment was wonderfully decorated. Fast-paced 70's music in the background to rush the customers--long wait time at dinner. On to the food:

Curry was good! Encapsulated in a caccoon of flavor. The coconut bowl complimented it well. I prefer my curry with potatoes but I didn't mind. Thai tea standard. Service was good (shout out to the pregnant lady. You were beast mode and hope you had a wonderful baby by the time of this posting!) 

Word of warning! The doorway doesn't provide clear WATCH YOUR STEP sign and I slipped (shout out to the man I accidentally nudged on my descent)"}
{"text":"Ah Pai, another jewel in Chef Nuit Regular's crown - a woman who has conquered Toronto's over saturated Thai cuisine scene! As with her other restaurants, the stand out dish is the Khao Soi. Another great item is the iced tea which is infused with kaffir lime. In summation, the food is stellar but the atmosphere is less inviting (the lighting is on the dimmer side making it hard to appreciate the visual aspects of dishes and be able to see what yore eating!)"}
{"text":"I don't know anyone who doesn't love Pai. Great Thai food in a unique space. 

All the staff are friendly and easy going. 

If you're in the mood for Thai and are in the area I would highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Pai doesn't disappoint! Came here for the second time and ordered:

GRABONG (4/5) 
(Vegetarian deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip)
This was delicious - I'd like to think that these squash fritters are a healthy version of fries haha. Its crispy and sweet - will order this again.

TOM YUM NAM SAI KUNG MOR FAI (4/5)
(A savoury, spicy and sour shrimp soup with lemongrass, coriander and green onions. Served with jasmine rice)
I love tom yum soup - last time I only got a small bowl so this time I decided to order the tom yum soup + rice as the main. Loved it! The portions were huge!

GAENG MASAMAN with braised beef (3/5)
(Braised beef in a peanut, tamarind curry with potatoes and topped with deep fried crispy shallots. (contains shrimp paste) with rice)
My bf got this one - we asked for mild for the level of spiciness (for the curry) but it was still really spicy. Yummy nonetheless."}
{"text":"don't know what the hype is about. the food was mediocre and service wasn't that great."}
{"text":"It was a bit of a wait on a weekday evening. I ordered the Khao Soi, and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was definitely enough of the soup/sauce leftover to make one or two more meals, so that was a nice bonus. I would definitely come back again to try the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. Great atmosphere and great food. Staff can be a little short tempered at times, so avoid the staff by getting take out."}
{"text":"My fav thai place with another location! Less busy / more space, food that is on par with the other sukhothai locations but with more variety, and friendly staff. Loved the ox tail curry, papaya salad, and the mango sticky rice"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because of the yelp reviews and was glad I did. Immediately I was drawn to the atmosphere and the decor. It feels like an underground street style but very hip hangout spot that you would find in Thailand even if I've never been (but a little imagination is all you need ;)). I went around 2 pm and we were quickly seated. The menu was hand drawn and coloured which I thought was very cute and contrasted the hip hop music blasting in the background (the choice of music was definitely a bonus for me). I ordered the Pad thai and my friend ordered the Pad gra prow. You can choose the level of spiciness, I chose the foreigner spicy which I thought was just right but next time I would definitely try the thai spicy for a good challenge (being the chili fan that I am). We had to wait quite a while for our food to come, not sure if it was because of the time we went or it's usually like this. The portions were moderate. My pad thai was good but it was too different from pad thais I've had in the past. However, I really enjoyed the pad gra prow which is apparently a popular street dish, it's basically rice with ground meat topped with fried egg. They serve a special sauce on the side for you to pour over the rice. I'm not sure what they put in the sauce aside from fish sauce but I was quite blown away by how good it tasted. The price of their entrees ranges from $11-13 which I find to be very reasonable. I would definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"Pai serves food that warms the soul and plays music that makes you want to dance. I really loved the \"bumpin'\" atmosphere and how friendly the servers were. The food was also topnotch and authentic. Morning glory was a great starter, followed by the green curry. I'd return here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"They have Khao Soi, which I've only ever seen in northern Thailand, so that excited me. So delicious! They also make a great Thai milk tea. Nice atmosphere. Baby friendly. I took my 7 month old with me. No high chairs but they had a change table in the bathroom."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Thai food flavors, but I came here with a group. Something about the spices, curry, and especially hot sauce just doesn't appeal to me. Either way I made the best out of the situation and enjoyed a so-so meal.

The food did take a while to come (about 20 min), probably it was a busy weekend night (in fact we waited 40 minutes to get into the restaurant, but they helpfully let us wander around the city and call us when a table was ready). The waiters helpfully came around about every 20 minutes to check up on our plates and water, and our waiter was super professional and efficient at handling the payment.

The interior decor is quite complete, and the place is dimly lit in very orange light. I was intrigued by the dining section where you could take off your shoes and sit on your legs on cushions."}
{"text":"The service is not so good, while I was waiting for the take out, a few waitress stopped by and keep asking if I have finished yet, actually I told each one of them I was waiting for my take out. At time of paying bills, the waitress keep asking if I need change back. No matter the service was good enough, I definitely would leave tips, plz give the change back first!!!"}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite restaurant. Every chance he gets he wants to have lunch here. It's always busy and gives off a great vibe. Favorite dish is the Pad Gra Prow."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for the weekend and looked at Yelp for a good restaurant for dinner after a comedy show at Second City. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is low profile at the entrance. Walking down a few stairs, we were welcomed by friendly staff who sat us immediately. The vibe was fun, relaxed, and hip. The drink menu was amazing and I wished we had more time so I could have tried more. I ordered the coconut and lemongrass infused sake, amazing! My companion ordered the plum mule which was good. There were so many cool and unique drink creations! I ordered a green curry that was served in a coconut, with a side of sticky rice and extra sauce. I opted for the tofu and veggies. It was good, but there was an odd taste that I couldn't put my finger on. My companion ordered an AMAZING beef noodle soup, OMG, so good! I loved how it had a cinnamon taste to it. Yum! The restaurant closed at 10:30pm, but the staff didn't rush anyone out. The staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"A must try! One of my favorite places to go for Thai food. Definitely for a heavier pallet but so flavorful and not overwhelming /competing tastes. Everything is delicately balanced be it the textures, visual presentation, and tastes are layered. Absolutely delicious when your first taste is delightful and follows with a 2nd taste in that same bite. That's when you know there's true art to the amazing food pieces they serve. 

Environment and ambiance is very warm, always packed, and relaxed vibe. When I have food friends in town, it's always a top of mind place to go and never fails to deliver and awe my guests though that are worldly travelers!"}
{"text":"I give Pai a 4/5 simply for their pad thai. It's out of this world! By far, the best pad thai I've ever had in Toronto! It's better than Khao San Road and their's pretty good before they changed their menu. 5/5

The chiang mai beef noodle soup was okay. The braised beef wasn't as tender as I would have liked it, but the soup had a good mix of sweet and salty. 3.5/5

The Khao soi was flavourful, but the sauce was too thick for my liking. It was very heavy so I just ate the noodles separately from the sauce. I think I liked Khao San Road's better. 3.5/5

We also ordered the thai ice tea. It wasn't as sweet as Khao San Roads, which I liked, but my only beef with it was it had too much shaved ice ! 3.5/5

I'll be coming back for the pad thai no doubt!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food here is good but is it really the best Thai food in Toronto? Debatable. And there's certainly other places with just as good food for half the price. I do love the ambience here though despite what others think!"}
{"text":"Where do I even start..... this was literally the BEST meal I have ever had. We waited over an hour to get in because it was so busy (I can see why) and I would have waited more. My friend's meals were just as good as mine if not better. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone. Even people who don't like Thai food because they'll probably like it after eating at Pai. I cannot stop thinking about my dinner. Service was also excellent. I wish I could give it 10 stars."}
{"text":"Having tried this restaurant a long time ago, I have been thinking about this ever since I booked my weekend bus tickets for Toronto. 

This place is a must go, the vibes are amazing. I can't stress enough how amazing the food is (that explains the insane line up). The staff is helpful and gives good suggestions. 
They don't have many vegetarian options, but the vegan Pad Thai is amazing. 

We went last weekend and ordered the same dishes we love so very much (Pad Thai and the Pad Gra Prow). This Thai restaurant is so wonderful that I want to be best friend with the chef and learn how to make the dishes. 

This place is quite packed in the evenings so I would suggest going for lunch. I haven't had that delicious Thai food in Montreal (if anyone knows- please tell me) but the food here is flavourful, fresh and I believe quite authentic. 

Best Thai food I have had so far, hands down. Highly recommend this place to everyone who is in Toronto or visiting."}
{"text":"Pai is definitely one of the best places to get Thai food in Toronto. The restaurant's food is consistently good, and comes out quite quickly. The servers are also knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu, and friendly to answer any questions.

I highly recommend the squash fritters, which are deep-fried clumps of shredded squash, as well as the Khao Soi, which is a thick curry noodle soup. For drink, I suggest trying the Thai Iced Tea - it's creamy and bright orange, and has a strong sweet taste. 

The only downside is that this restaurant is quite popular, so there always tends to be a line, especially on weekends. It also tends to get loud in the restaurant later in the evening!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Thai cuisine. Food price range is reasonable (around 15-20$ per dish). The restaurant had a really cool vibe, I like their menus which were very cute and hand written. 

I personally prefer PAI to khao san road, taste wise. 

The service here is quite slow. It took almost 20 mins to get our bill and maybe 40 mins to get our order... Definitely make a reservation before going or you may wait a while!"}
{"text":"This place was my first restaurant in Toronto. It was a good start .  A Pat-tai was really good and a fried rice is my favorite item in Pai. If you enjoy Thai food, you should go this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for dinner and their food is SO DELICIOUS!!!  Especially the yam fritters and and the Khao Soi with braised beef."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been loving this place, and we always go there for dinner. However, after we ate there again last night, both of us have been diarrhea and vomiting, so I decided to update my review.  

We ordered two Thai milk ice tea, two curries (which we always order) and Pai sausage plate for the first time. Both of us thought the sausages tasted a bit suspicious(it was sticky and raw), but none of us could tell why....  I hope the management of PAI finds out the reason..."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this restaurant and definitely not my last. The ambience is \"hippie\", they play good choices of music and the staffs are friendly too. Anyway, I ordered Khao Soi which is a Thai Coconut Curry Noodle Soup with Chicken Breast (or you can have a choice of Braised Beef or Chicken Drumstick). Honestly, the aroma of the soup makes you want to dig in right away and the soup base is flavourful. On the other hand, my friend recommended the Thai Iced Tea so I gave it a shot and its taste is legit 10/10"}
{"text":"Another great Thai place in Toronto, if not my favourite. Their Squash Fritters are excellent and the Pad Gra Prow is another very tasty dish with stir fried ground beef on top of jasmine rice plus a fried egg on top. Great atmosphere for a group - loud, fun and always busy. Another long wait though, so best to go during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"1st time today and it won't be my last. The first thing you notice as you walk in is the warm and welcoming vibe this place has, even at peak lunch hour. Yes it was noisy, yes it was full but welcome to the big city. The host found us a seat immediately and was pleasant. It had been a while since I had  gone out with this particular friend so we kept neglecting to look at the menu. Luckily the server was extremely patient and extremely cute but I digress. The menu though busy in lay out was EASY to master. Unfortunately there were no THAI OMELETTES left so I went with my staple PANANG BEEF and we ordered spring rolls to start. FAST and EFFICIENT! Beer was perfectly cold, the spring rolls were cooked well with very little grease and had a spicy kick to them. My main course (beef panang) was rich and creamy and oh so delicious. Coffee was perfect and the glutinous rice dessert with mango hit the sweet tooth spot without going into diabetic coma. All in all...,a wonderful spot to eat and be merry. No pressure to leave, we lingered for a bit....don't worry we ordered things....we aren't cheap lol. I say go and try it out. Plus the staff are so very sweet, kind AND attractive lol"}
{"text":"Our end to end dining experience was very long, we had to wait a long time to be seated, waited a long time to order our food, spent 50 mins waiting for the food. When the waitress asked someone in the kitchen to come out and speak to us, the  person said, \"you haven't waited more than 30 mins yet\" which was very unapologetic and accusing. The waitress only came by twice to give us water. The flavour and taste was great however it wasn't worth the wait and the attitude really set off the taste."}
{"text":"The bar I measure all Thai restaurants by, is the Lotus of Siam in Vegas. It is spectacular -- see my (or Anthony Bourdain's) review. 
So imagine my delight, as I need a place to go after a concert at Roy Thomson Hall and search Yelp, discovering this spot. 
Upon arrival, I had downstairs with my three little kids (8,5,3) in tow, and see a bar and wonder if I've made an error. The place is packed, at 5:15 pm. They get us a spot within minutes, and start taking our order comfortably fast. 
I zoom in on Thai beef salad, Pad Thai and a few other dishes. To summarize, they were terrific. The side fresh home made Thai hot sauce, was equally great. Normal I order everything stupid spicy, and unfortunately I could not, due to my little rascals. But they gave me fresh hot chillies and sauces galore to keep my palate on fire. 
Once finished, we noticed the line. Out the restaurant! 
Obviously this gem was only a secret to me. I'll be back, many, many, many more times to come."}
{"text":"The food is better than in Thailand itself, since I love to travel to Thailand. The music is good, the location is in central downtown, and the service is good."}
{"text":"The price is pretty much the same as other restaurants in the area. I love the curry and the fried squash here. This is usually my go-to Thai restaurant; I could do without the line ups but that's the price you pay for quality."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Highly advised to book a table in advanced. Although we did not and the mines were long, the wait itself after being placed on the wait list for 2, was quite short. The curry here is just amazing and I love the coconut taste in it. Must try :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and good drinks too! The place is loud and the service is slow but nothing beats the taste."}
{"text":"I've been to PAI more than a handful of time now and it never disappoints. Food is always delicious, their Thai iced tea is a must try! Wait time are over an hour if you arrive after 6pm, so try for an early dinner. Service is ok - can be slow sometimes. If you're looking for a more secluded, quiet meal, this is NOT it; tables are super close to one another and it gets quite loud."}
{"text":"I actually had a few good PAST experiences with this restaurant. I guess it's true that one negative experience trumps any number of positive experiences, leading to my writing this review.

Most recently, I ordered on Ritual the green curry and pad thai for some friends and I. The ones who had the green curry were food poisoned. It wasn't fun, I can tell you. I imagine we weren't the only ones, as the restaurant looked really busy - unless this is just the luck of Ritual.

Needless to say, I will never return to Pai again.

Good luck, fellow restaurant-goers, on the diarrhea roulette."}
{"text":"I've come to Pai a handful of times seeking something flavourful, and my tastebuds have never left unsatisfied!

The wait time to get a table can be long, especially during lunch and dinner time. We got here at 5:30 pm on a Saturday and waited about 30 minutes. By the time we left at 7:30 pm, the wait time was over an hour long! So definitely get here early. While waiting, you get a buzzer, so you're free to get a drink at the bar or get some much-needed fresh air without losing your spot in line.

Although the wait time can be long, the food definitely makes up for it! We started with the Moo Ping, which is grilled pork skewers--although small, they were absolutely delicious! I had the Gang Kiaw Wan, which is green curry served in a coconut. Not going to lie, I did get this dish pretty much because it was served in a coconut, but the food definitely tasted as good as it looked! Although it was medium spice, it wasn't too much to handle. The curry's sweetness and the rice definitely helped with the spiciness!

Other than the long lines, my only complaint would be the service, especially during busy times. Our server basically disappeared after almost taking our orders. Thankfully the bartender was attentive, and stepped in to take our orders and bring us the bills when we were getting restless!

All in all, I would definitely recommend a visit to Pai. They serve some of the best Thai food you can get in the city, however be sure to leave enough time for the wait!"}
{"text":"Didn't know there is this super popular place near me, and went for my first time. Waiting around 40mins, ordered those transitional Thai dishes. Have to say worth the waiting time, every one of them is tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! I ordered chicken green curry which was served in a coconut.  Since the coconut was a little small they served more of the meal in a bowl.  I would come back again"}
{"text":"love the food here! they have tons of vegan options and have a really nice ambience too."}
{"text":"love the food, everything is very flavorful and at a good price; however i had a problem with the wait time and is hard to make a reservation. 
You really need to make a reservation a month advance if your planning for  a group gathering or birthday. The staff are nice but get really busy at the night time, if your just in town and want to try thai food come during lunch time , you would experience the thai food the best at lunch time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday about 12 noon.  The place was already packed.  Heard that this was a popular place.  I ordered the chicken Pad Thai mild.  It came served on a banana leaf on a plate.  Peanuts and cabbage salad were served on the side of the dish.  It had big slices of chicken.  It was delicious.  Probably will come back to try the other menu items like Thai fried rice.  If you are a group of six or more a 20% auto service charge will be added to your bill.  Read the fine print at the bottom of the menu.
At the back of the restaurant they have the Thai market. Here you can get one meat item & rice for $10.  No need to line up."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto for a business trip and saw this place was highly rated and near my hotel. I decided to brave the cold and walk over after ordering online through the maegan app which was a breeze, and the food was ready before the specified time.

For a starter, I got the spring rolls, which were excellent. You would never know they were vegetarian because the inside was super savory and the outside was fried to crispy perfection. Highly recommend these as an appetizer.

I decided to keep it simple with the Chef Nuit Pad Thai for my main, and it did not disappoint. It was a bit sweeter than expected but that's OK, the chicken wasn't dry (which is a victory in and of itself) and I liked the thinner-than-usual noodles. 

My only complaints were the spice level and dinner menu selection. I ordered \"Foreigner Hot\" because I was a foreigner and love spicy food but there was basically no spice at all. If you call yourself a spicy food fan I'd opt for the Thai Spicy level. I also wish the dinner menu had some of the choices from the lunch menu, but this is just personal preference."}
{"text":"Love love love this place the staff is really friendly and the food is AMAZING... I'm not giving 5 stars because the waitress made a mistake on our bill, but as soon as we let her know she quickly fix it."}
{"text":"Hot damn, the official challenger to Suko Thai for Thai food supremacy might just be located on Duncan St in downtown Toronto! 

As part of what is regarded as the big three of Thai food restaurants in the T. (Suko Thai, Kao San Rd, and Pai) I had heard of but never been to Pai. Until today. And man, am I ever glad I went.

Located in the split basement level of a trendy downtown building it might not resemble the heavyweight contender it is on first blush, but after you go inside it gets a lot more serious. Heavy wood tables with powder steel adorn the inside which is decorated with Thai accents and wood detailing. There is a bar to the left for singles and those in for a quick drink or bite, and the table section is on either side of the bar. The staff is friendly, greets you right away and has you seated and with menus within minutes of your arrival.

The Food:

As mentioned, for me, the benchmark for Thai excellence is Suko Thai. But I have to say after eating at Pai, we've officially got a tie (Get it? I know, terrible. Moving on!). I ordered the Pad Thai which had its own homemade tamarind sauce, which is excellent. The portion is ridiculous. It's a mammoth pile of noodles, bean sprouts, tofu and chicken (You choose between chicken, beef, or veggie. Shrimp is $2-3 extra). It comes with a side of dried cabbage (I think that's what it was). And it's all good. Like, really fricken' good!

Next, the spring rolls. Artistically plated and delicious to a criminal degree, they are served with a sweet Chilli sauce which is on its own pretty damn good as well.

Service was attentive, food arrived quickly. Severs were friendly, too. Were a little slow with the bill at the end, but this was after they got incredibly busy (the restaurant naturally fills up during dinner service). 

Atmosphere, service, food: Incredible. GO!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner 
Never disliked anything on the menu! 

I'd recommend trying any of these items 
1) starter tom yum soup with shrimp 
2) chef unit pad Thai 
3) green curry
4) pad gra pow (chicken)"}
{"text":"Amazing food for amazing value - my boyfriend and I absolutely love this place. Props to the chef Nuit Regular for bringing her A-game to this restaurant. If you like Thai food this is the place to go! And if you aren't sure about Thai, try this and you'll learn you love it (most North American Thai food doesn't even come close to this)."}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Thai. Just the right quantity without being too oily. Would come back."}
{"text":"I think they have the best Thai food in Toronto.
They own a bunch of the other restaurants in the city.

Papaya salad is super refreshing. The fried pork rinds and prawn chips that come with it are are super yummy.

Khao Soi with braised beef has depths of flavour. The braised beef is very tender.

Pad Gra Prow with pork belly is bomb as usual. Fragrant basil with crispy pork belly. Fried egg on top.

I would recommend going right when they open for lunch at 11:30am. It fills up fast."}
{"text":"We waited in line for 20 mins on a Wednesday night but I won't complain because this is one of the busiest restaurant in Toronto as far as I know.

I ordered the so-called legendary Khao Soi and sadly I didn't like it very much.
The dish was very sweet and I got sick of it after 2 bites.

What I do liked very much was the appetizer squash fritters. The potion was generous and it taste amazing. My boyfriend enjoyed his pai thai as well.

So far I ain't all cuckoo about this place but I do like to give it another shot one-day to figure out of why this is one of the most popular restaurant in TO."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim one summer night and left very pleased. In my opinion, this is very comparable to Khao San Road with slightly lower prices. As usual, I ordered my favorite thai dish, Khao Soi. The quality is very comparable to Khao San with exception to the viscosity of the curry, which was made noticeably less thick at Pai. My only other complaint (which really shouldn't even be a complaint) is that that there were an overwhelming amount of beef compared to noodle and personally, I prefer to have balanced ratio of each.

Not to mention, the resto has a very cool and hip vibe with enthusiastic servers, which is always a bonus. Pai is your best bet for thai food if you want to skip the line for Khao San Road."}
{"text":"2 years ago, in Eat, Pray, Love style - I decided to leave Toronto and move to Thailand. The best part about living there was the food! I know it may not be PC but I love the Thai food in Toronto more than Thailand (feel free to judge me). 

Pai is hands down the best Thai food I've ever had (for a  really long time Sukho was tops for me but I think Pai beats Sukho.)

If you have out of town friends - this is the place to take them!!"}
{"text":"This is the place where I take my out of town friends! It's an iconic Toronto Thai restaurant and often has a long line up. It's recommended to avoid peak hour, especially if you're a big group. They have a part of seating where you take off your shoes and sit at a platform table. Super fun!

Some of my favorite dishes:
Grabong - Buttercup sqush fritters. It is a huge portion, and the taste is amazing with the dipping sauce!
Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut) - Delicious green curry! Try it with sticky rice, and scoop out the coconut flesh (tastes like jello :)
Pad Gra Prow - I love it with ground pork! The sauce to be drizzled on top of the dish makes it extra delicious!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and ate at the bar. Great service. The house sangria was so good! My boyfriend had a beer and switched to sangria after trying mine. We started with the wing appetizer - good sauce. We shared the Pad Gra Prow with pork and the Khao Soi with braised beef. The Khao Soi was incredible! We both ate way past full because we couldn't get enough of the broth. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The green curry and pad Thai was amazing!!! Great ambiance also and the place is a lot bigger than you think. Staff was friendly! Love the sticky rice as well."}
{"text":"Super good food!!!!!!! We loved it, reminds us Thailand. We felt like we were in the country with the food and decoration in the place. Will go back definitively. Just a little bit crowdy and noisy"}
{"text":"Make sure to get their early or make a reservation, as this place gets full fast.  Another great restaurant from the original owners of Sukkothai from Chef Nuit and Peter. This restaurant is another sample of Chef Nuit's Northern Thai cuisine, which is very similar to Laos style food.  Think more aromatic, earthy flavors, with a hit fresh herbs and dried chilies. My favorite is the Koi Soi, with its rich coconut curry broth, egg noodles, and fresh herbs. Good price points, and always consistent food. FYI my background is Laos, Cambodian, and our village was 30 mins from the Thai boarder.  So, my test for authenticity is to test their Thai, and I will always love an authentic Thai restaurant, run by Thai chefs."}
{"text":"It's pretty good for Americans who would like to try authentic Thai food but not up for the pure real authentic Thai meal. I ordered the papaya salad, lemon grass tom yum soup, pad Thai, and masaman curry. All was good with spices."}
{"text":"I have been to Pai several times now and they never disappoint!
The best authentic Thai food I have eaten. I usually get the green curry with some satay. They are so delicious, fresh and flavourful I will keep coming back. It's expected that their is a wait for this place so I recommend getting a reservation if you can."}
{"text":"My boyfiend and i were on vaca in toronto and were looking for somewhere good to eat downtown toronto. We decided on thai and came across this place on yelp which had good reviews. I saw that it closed ar 1030 and it was around 10 so we had to hurry. We got lost finding this place and we didnt find parking until about 1025. The nice gentleman at the door was kind enough to still let us be seated. We got an app which was the thai chicken wings were crispy and flavorful. We got drinks which were good and our food was amazing. Our server was super nice too! This was such a great experience for our first dinner in toronto."}
{"text":"The prices are a little steep, but the hype is real. We came for lunch at 12:30pm on a Saturday with no reservation and luckily didn't have to wait at all, even as a group of 8. We must have come at a perfect time window because all the vacant tables were filled 10 minutes after we were seated, so I recommend making a reservation!

The restaurant interior was dimly lit and cozy, and the service was friendly and competent. I shared the ~CA$6 Thai Chicken Wings with two others in the group, which were quite small but on point with that classic Thai-style chicken flavor. I'd only recommend this appetizer to someone who REALLY likes chicken wings though.

For my entree, I ordered a ~CA$16 Pad Gra Pow, which consisted of holy basil stir fried with a choice of meat (ground pork), steamed jasmine rice, a thai-styled fried egg on top, and nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili, and lime) on the side. I wished the portion size had been at least 25% bigger, especially given its high price. HOWEVER, THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST FLAVORFUL AND SAVORY MEALS I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME. I wolfed down the meal in record time, and you could tell that the food at Pai Thai was good overall because our table grew quiet when all of it came; you could only hear chewing and slurping noises at that point.

I enjoyed my experience at Pai Thai and would be down to come back again! If you've never been here and are visiting Toronto, I highly recommend trying this place out. By the way, the Toronto Aquarium is a 15-minute walk from here, so you could factor that into your itinerary. Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Pai is one of my most recommended places to go to in Toronto. Not just the best Thai food but for anyone looking for solid, amazing food. You will not be disappointed.

I have probably tried over 70% of the menu and it all tastes great. Recently have ordered takeout delivery for Pad Gra Prow and when I got it, the egg was still runny. That's the kind of detail you're getting as most places would've had an overcooked egg by the time it got to me."}
{"text":"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  
I had lunch there couple years ago. Because the customer service was terrible, that's why I remember it so vividly.  The food was okay not Exceptional just OK. Here's what happened, I ordered the meal and then I wanted to add something to my order, but the server the way she snapped at me as if it is the end of WORLD for her change my order. Later on when we ordered mango juice and wanted to ask her to hold off the ice, but we were so scared to ask her again. My worst experience of Thai food."}
{"text":"We mistakenly believed that this restaurant would be empty at 5:15 on a weekday. It was anything but. Luckily, they were able to get a table for two within five minutes. They've managed to fit quite a lot of people in the space that they have.

I ordered the khao soi, while my friend ordered the pad gra prow. I was starving before my meal, but was quite full within ten minutes. The curry is quite filling by the end. It was a little spicier than I anticipated, but I have very little tolerance, so it probably would be fine for most people. 

Like many others, I was impressed by the service. I've eaten at many other restaurants a lot emptier than Pai with much less attentive employees. Kudos to the servers for making sure all customers were taken care of. I think this practice also ensures that people are in and out within an hour or so. Would definitely return if I was ever craving Thai food."}
{"text":"Great place amazing food ! People are nice even though we had to wait for over 45 minutes without a reservation to get seats"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai food in Toronto. I've never been to Khao San road before they closed, but this one hits the spot.  The decor inside is like a thai backpacking place - very original.  It is in the basement, but very spacious - which unfortunately does not mean that there's always space - more often than not it is completely full and you have to wait.  Bad for people who never wait for any restaurant (like me), so just move on.

Otherwise, the food is amazing.  My Pad Thai with chicken was just right, exact combination of sauce, noodles and meat.  My girflriends veggie dish was also very well cooked and had amazing flavor - a rarity for vegetarian dishes.  They have a good selection of beer and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this restaurant after hearing rave revues from friends.  Crowded on arrival but luckily we were seated on the patio right away.  Good choice of beverages and a course of Thai beers to try at great prices.
Service was quick and very friendly.  We ordered spring rolls to share as an appetizer for $7.00 and they were delicious.   Lovely tangy sauce for dipping and the spring rolls were nice and crispy without being too oily.
All of our mains were delicious as well. The Pad Thai was authentic and perfect heat with the \"foreigner\" spice. 
Another main ordered was the Khao Pad Thamada with chicken.  Lovely Jasmine rice with hints of oyster sauce and lime.
I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with pork.  I felt adventurous so ordered Thai spicy which notes on the menu as being the most authdntic Thai heat. I do like my food spicy so was up for the taste test.   The waitress did ask me if I was sure of the heat choice and I had to assure her it would be fine.  The pork was served over jasmine e rice and was very flavorful.  And yes the Thai heat was very spicy but very tasty if you like things hot.
The most interesting presentation was the Gaeno Kiaw Wan.  Green curry with beef.  This main arrives in a coconut with a side of jasmine rice.  The coconut adds a bit of sweetness to the curry and although the \"foreigner\" spice was ordered the coconut milk also alleviated some of the heat.
Great service, delicious food with a lot of choices.  Will certainly be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Slightly overrated to be honest. 

The chicken satay and garlic shrimp were amazing. The chicken was very soft and shrimp was extremely flavourful and crispy. 

But the main course of pad gra prow was disappointing. My friend didn't think her chicken pad thai was anything special either.  On my rice dish the spinach felt stringy and overcooked and didnt taste that good. The rice was very overcooked too."}
{"text":"This place has been one of my favorite restaurants worldwide since it opened, and it does not disappoint. The environment is rowdy and it's always packed, so you have to be in the right mood, but if so, prepare for incredible Thai food - especially the Northern Thai cuisine that is the speciality. Not to be overlooked is the INCREDIBLE tom yum. It's mind blowing. My favorite restaurant in Toronto, hands down."}
{"text":"This lively Thai restaurant is trendy and very busy. Their customer service is great and the food is top notch. We sat at a floor table on some comfy cushions on the side and had the whole table to ourselves.

I tried the green curry, which comes in a coconut bowl with a side of rice. The dish was rich, flavourful, and just the right amount of spice (slow burn). But like other yelpers, I had a really upset stomach after, so I assumed I got food poisoning. I emailed Pai to let them know and their owner assured me they were looking into it and invited me back for a meal on the house. When we returned, the owner came by our table to check in on us and I was so floored by his attentiveness and the other staff's friendliness.

They think the Thai eggplant in the green curry is causing stomach issues (it's a natural laxative). They've removed the eggplant from the green curry so hopefully that isolates the problem!

Must try: shrimp chips (off the menu) a basket of them comes with oyster sauce
Pad thai (it's the safe option and they make a really good one **fellow cilantro-haters: ask for no cilantro!**

Pass on the mango sticky rice, it was waaaay too sweet.

For the stellar customer service, lively atmosphere and delicious food, I'm sold on Pai."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai here is best I've ever had. This is a basic staple in all thai restaurants I have been to. If you don't know what to get, you can't go wrong with this. We also ordered a special Khao Soi Braised Beef. It was good, the soup was not hot when it reached our table, but the overall flavor was still decent. I probably would not order this again, personal taste, because I thought the flavor of this curry had a higher emphasis on a turmeric and coconut flavor. 

As a note, both of these dishes were ordered mild! Boyfriend and I felt this this was a bit spicy! Boyfriend cannot eat spicy food (as he thinks chicken from Chipotle is spicy). Nice comparison for those who are wondering what kind of spice level to get. 
Only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 was because the soup was not hot when it reached our table and it was hard to flag down waiters to help get the check or to-go boxes."}
{"text":"I don't normally like thai food; peanut and oyster sauces are not appetizing to me, and neither is pad thai because I don't like my noodles to be mushy. BUT. Pai Northern Thai Kitchen has AMAZING food. I had the green curry, which comes in a coconut. I had it mild, and it was a good amount of spice for me. My boyfriend got a soup with peanut based broth and beef in it, and I really liked his food too. The chicken satay skewers were really tender, and not tough at all. It's  nice atmosphere as well. Our server was nice, and Peter at the bar is great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yay! Another bookmarked restaurant down! And it was so great. We came in at around 5:30pm and it was PACKED. They managed to squeeze us in, but I seriously recommend making reservations before hand.

PRO TIP: they do NOT take reservations on the day of.

Gai Satay (5/5) - AMAZING. Like genuinely the best thing we had at Pai's. I think the peanut was seriously something special--I've never had anything as great. They also came with these spicy pickles which were also ridiculously great.

Issan Sausage (3.5/5) - A smash hit with the rest of the party, but not with me. I thought the hot sauce was fab, but the sausage was pretty dry to be completely honest.

Fish Fillet With Tamarind Sauce (4/5) - Forgot the name of this one but it was great! Crispy and yummy and all around a good dish.

Massaman Beef Brisket (5/5) - BOMBBBB. So good!! Tender and flavourful, well rounded and super comforting.

Pad Thai (3/5) - Meh. Not impressed. Not much to say here.


We also got Thai iced teas which were great--everyone thought it was refreshing and just sweet enough. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all Toronto. 5 out of 5 based on taste. I only created an account just to let you all know how good it is!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food - coconut water is a must-have!  It is a long wait on weekends so be prepared to wait 30-60 minutes if you arrive aroudn dinner time."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy Thai food! We ordered take-out; pad thai, fried fish curry, beef curry, papaya salad and ground beef rice. Everything was super tasty!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service.  Try the vegetarian spring rolls and the Pad Thai.  Green Curry was great, as was the fried fish plate.  My only complaint -- LOUD inside the restaurant, but other than that it was a first rate meal, good prices and conveniently located for those of us attending the Toronto Film Festival."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto and definitely worth the wait. Go early, leave your name and number down for a table, then go to one of the nearby bars for a drink while you wait. 

Pad Thai - one of the best and most flavourful Pad Thais in the city. Comes with chopped peanuts on the side, and you can select your spiciness level. 

Khao Soi - a heavier noodle soup. Soup is incredibly flavourful and creamy

Chang Mai Beef Noodle Soup - slight hint of heat, and incredibly flavourful soup base. Beef is tender and melts in your mouth. Wonton chips on top add the perfect bit of crunch. 

Only issue is we had to wait about 30 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered."}
{"text":"A thai restaurant on King west with full of tasty dishes that are a little pricey. I've been here a couple times and I'm satisfied every time! It is almost always busy and the service isn't bad either. Pak boong fai deng (Morning Glory) was a little salty but good, Chef nuit pad thai is good too but I was never a huge fan of pad thai because of the little sweetness. Pad gra prow with crispy pork (Moo Grob) was my favourite! Had it made spicy and it really was spicy but enjoyed it. As for the Panang chicken curry, it was good but I'd still stick to my Pad gra prow!"}
{"text":"So...I went again recently to Pai. This time, it was for dinner.
The service was slower than last time (or because we were just super hungry!), but the food is great as expected.

We went on a week day night at around 7:30pm. We were quickly seated, however our waitress did not attend our table for a while because it was really busy.

The food is excellent. I ordered a green curry chicken that came in a fresh coconut, and the flavour is nice and rich, but the curry is not overpowering, which is nice :D.

Definitely will be back again when the weather gets warmer."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai places to eat. This is a MUST try. Went here a few times and they never disappoint! Make a reservation through their website or walk in, although depending on the day, you'll probably have to wait a bit. But you can go to the bar and get a drink while you wait.


We ordered:

1. Thai iced tea: 10/10. SOOOOO GOOD! Thai version of a milk tea, and it's my favourite!

2. Grabong: 7/10. Fried Squash shreds. Served with tamarind dip. App for those that want something on the sweet side. 

3. Chef Nuit Pad Thai w/ shrimp: 10/10. Delicious. Presentation was great & it was nice and hot. Can also choose how spicy you want the dish. 

4. Green curry: 10/10. My favourite main! Best green curry I've ever had. Good combo of flavours. Served with rice. Comes in a coconut, so you can carve the insides & eat it with the green curry too. Would order this again!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Toronto. Come early or make a reservation since this place fills up (or sit at the bar). They are known for the khao soi (egg noodles in curry). I got it with steamed veggies on the side since the dish is very creamy and has no veggies. Paired nicely with the braised beef, but probably good with chicken as well."}
{"text":"It was fantastic! Had the papaya salad and the pad gra pow. Cool looking place with a great atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave Thai food, I think about Pai! They're always busy, but I never had a problem getting a seat since I was always dining with one other person. It can become quite noisy, but if you can get past that you will love it!

Dishes we ordered on my last visit for dinner: 

Gai Satay ($12.50) - The chicken was very juicy and tender, and the peanut sauce added a delicious mix of nutty, sweet and tangy flavours.

Laap Salad ($15) - This was my first time trying a Laap Salad and I was intrigued by all the different ingredients that went into making this dish. I really enjoyed the salad because the pork mix had a delicious complexity of flavours with a strong kick from the chilies. The slices of cucumber added a refreshing touch to help balance out the spice.

Starter Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp ($6.50) - If you're a fan of sour foods like me, you will love this tom yum soup! The soup was very rich, spicy and sour, a great pick-me-up for someone who's feeling under the weather.

Pad Gra Prow with Beef ($15) - The pad gra prow with beef was one of the new dishes I fell in love with. The stir fried ground beef was extremely flavourful and mouthwatering. If you'd like to try a new dish, but not keen on being too adventurous, I highly recommend this dish.

Khao Soi with Shrimp ($17) - Another fantastic new dish that I tried. The golden curry was delicious and had a thick and creamy consistency, and the egg noodles were very soft and fresh. 

I have to say that Pai is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto and if I lived downtown I would probably eat there once a week. Check them out if you haven't already, you will fall in love with their food!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Easily my new favourite Thai restaurant and I can see what all the rave reviews are about. We started with the spring rolls (best I've ever had), and then shared three main dishes: chicken pad Thai, pork pad gra prow and beef khao pad thamada. All of the dishes were so delicious that I was stuffed to the point I couldn't eat anymore (at which point I usually don't want to think about food for at least half a day), but this time I was craving more within the hour. The pad gra prow was definitely my favourite, the way the flavours all melded together was perfect. I had to try it mild because my friend doesn't do well with spicy good but I think it'd be even more delicious with a kick of spice in it. The other two dishes were good, but can't say they blew me out of the club water like this one.

We also had a pitcher of sangria which was decent."}
{"text":"Great Thai spot just off of queen west. This place gets busy so be prepared to wait. 

Casual dining experience with friendly and efficient staff. 

I ordered the pad Thai and it was delicious. Tasty, good portion size and very flavourful. 

All in all a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Hands-down best Thai food. We have picked up takeout from here more than a few times and it's always been great. I usually grab a Pad Gra Prow with the crispy pork and the rest of the family typically Pad Thai. Spring rolls and the squash fritters are a must!

Decided we wanted to try eat-in last weekend. Arrived at about 4pm and were seated immediately :) 

Started with chicken satay, spring rolls and squash fritters. The fritters are good for takeout, but they are MUST HAVE fresh! So good. 

The wife and I both ordered the Khao Soi and boy oh boy, so good. The flavour of the curry is incredibly deep and rich. So delicious. Braised beef was tender and delicious. 

Overall, one of the more memorable and enjoyable food experiences in the city to date! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! Food is reasonably priced here and comes in large portions. The restaurant is bustling and a little loud so you'll have to lean in to hear the conversation. Service is a little slow but friendly.

I ordered the Pad Thai and the thai iced tea, both of which were very good! The noodles were chewy and had a nice sweet and sour tang. 

Parking is pretty much non-existant, so your best bet is either street parking or finding a flat-rate parking lot. Oh, and be prepared to wait a while if you don't have a reservation!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food at Pai is delicious! Nice presentation. The service is excellent! Quaint layout with simple decor. Very busy!

We started with a pitcher of sangria. I can't remember all the ingredients but there was guava and lychee involved. Very refreshing.

The spring rolls were crispy and delicious. Also vegetarian for the health conscious.

Pad Gra Prow with Crispy Pork (Moo Grob), served over rice, was outstanding! The pork had a lot of flavour and I loved the crispy bits.

The green curry chicken was creamy and rich with a coconut curry flavour! I'd be happy with just the sauce over rice.

The Pad Thai with beef may be one of the best I've had! Every bite had a different layer of taste and texture.

The fried fish with green curry sauce was perfectly crispy, yet flaky. As good as it was, we preferred the other dishes.

Was this the best Thai restaurant I've been to? Maybe. I highly recommend it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Having been a loyal Khao San Road fan for several years,  I was excited to try out Pai. Definitely a great space with alot more seating, and the reasonable noise level where you could still talk. I got the ox tail which was fall of the bone tender. It had the right level of spice to go with the rice it came with.  My friends all ordered the Thai ice tea which was good all around and everyone was pleased with their different dishes.  Service was on point and quick. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"loved the food, the masaman curry is really excelent, if in Toronto again, I would defintely come back to this place"}
{"text":"Love the decor of pai. Brings me back to one of the Western hippie joints back in pai Thailand. The retro feel was done in good taste. The only issue I have is the benches are high. If you are short and sat on the bench it would be good. However if you're short and got stuck with a seat across the bench like I was, it brings you back to your childhood when your parents look down on you and tell you to eat your veggies. I ordered khao sao which is egg noodles and chicken over a yellow curry broth and crispy noodles on the side. Overall the dish was good but toward the end of the meal the broth felt rich. I guess I was just hungry to begin with hence didn't have that as a first impression. The chicken was OK. Although I didn't ask for the breast I got it. In hindsight it worked out since dark meat would have made it over the top. Over all the meal was a good experience. It does take you back to pai and they also serve Chang and singha beers."}
{"text":"Everything I had here was delicious. I came with a group and we ordered almost everything on the menu so I was able to try a little bit of everything, which was great.

My second time back, I knew exactly what I liked from before and got to order and eat a larger portion.

The atmosphere is great and very laid back.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here 12:15 for a group lunch and was told to wait outside for 45 min. While we waited outdoor, most customers came in between and waited inside were seated - which pissed us off a little bit and almost gave up.
However we decided to stay and boy was it a good decision. The 5 of us were seated in the bar area and food came pretty fast because it was past 1 when we ordered.
I tried Panang curry with beef at Max spicy level and it was totally acceptable to average Canadian tastebuds. The curry is rich and creamy, flavoured perfectly and portion was just perfect. 
Would hv given it 5 stars if not for the seating drama."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot despite the long wait. I can always wait in their 40-50 mins queue to taste the deliciousness. We ordered thai style chicken wings which were amazing, wish I had order 2-3 extra pieces. For the mains I ordered Gaeng Masaman curry which was the best I've ever had and my husband ordered Khao Soi which was as good as it can get."}
{"text":"After reading all of the amazing reviews, we were really excited to try this place during our trip to Canada. Unfortunately, it was nothing special. The appetizers were not bad but Pad Thai and other main courses were very average. When the check came and we explained that we are paying with American currency we were told that it will be the same amount. Really?!? Definitely not coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Service, bomb.
People, bomb.
Food, life changing. I don't ever say the food is life changing but let me tell you,I was blown away. The flavours made me tear up. (I am a flavour lover)
I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"The hype is real
I've eaten Thai quite a few places and nobody comes close to this joint. Make sure you get there earlier than lunch/ dinner rush starting otherwise you will wait. 
Chef Nuit had outdone herself. Dishes made to perfection. No complaints. 
Best. Thai. Ever. Believe it.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really really LOVE Thai food, and this place is THE place to be when you want authentic Thai food!

First off, this place is always packed! ALWAYS! They use to take your cell phone number down and they would text you to notify you if your table is ready but just recently they've change that. You can't leave the premise anymore instead they will give you a buzzer which is so inconvenient. 

The service is kind and friendly, the place is huge which I've discovered only recently. There's more seating all the way to the right and back! It's pretty squished though. I had to stand up a couple of times to let people pass.

The service is pretty fast and friendly, the food is A1! I highly recommend trying their squash Fritters to start, super crispy and I can't stop munching on it! And obviously sip on their infamous Thai Iced Tea. For the mains: you must try their PAD THAI! obviously. The flavours are just sooo tasty, their portion is super huge, I never finish it. Also please try their Pork Pad Gra Prow, and their oxtail! The flavours are indescribably Amazing! 

I suggest coming right when they open but if you don't mind waiting then there's a bar in the waiting area, and as far as I'm aware you can also grab food and apps while you wait! 

I've been here wayyy too many times to count, I enjoy it every single time!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably amazing. My Mom ordered the Green Curry which comes IN A COCONUT people. In a coconut. I ordered the Khao Soi which was unbelievably creamy and decadent. I will be going back here time and time again over Khao San Road. Thank you Pai for bringing delicious Thai food to our city!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, the best Thai I've had in Toronto so far!"}
{"text":"I have been past this location hundreds of times and wasn't aware of it. My friends and I went for lunch and were thrilled at our experience. Two of us required vegan and gluten free meals and the other two did not. The menu clearly indicated which items could be done vegan and gluten free and we were able to choose our spice level.
Two had the red curry dish with tofu and loved it. The other two had the pad Thai, one chicken and mine was with tofu and medium spice. Spice level was perfect and tolerable. The meal was so delicious. I was full after eating half of it and should have had the rest packed, but it was so tasty so I finished it. My friend ordered the coconut sorbet (vegan) topped with pralines, toasted coconut, tapioca and corn something. It was outstanding. I was too full to enjoy it so I will go back just for that. I had coconut water with my meal, which was very flavourful but expensive at $6 per glass. The pad Thai was $13.50 but it was a big portion.
It is casual inside with tall and short wood tables and a bar. I'm definitely going back since it is walking distance to Princess of Wales, Royal Alex, Tiff Bell Lightbox and Roy Thompson Hall. They have a sister restaurant close by called Kiin which the server said is a little more upscale."}
{"text":"Tried them out today and was completely unsatisfied. Tried it coz of the rave reviews about the food and atmosphere but Food is very meh. Ordered the Tom Yum soup and asked the server if its possible to make it less spicy, he said it's not that spicy but when the food came, I barely ate it. My boyfriend tried the Khao Soi as it is very popular and but he was disappointed with the taste too.

The place is very artsy and pleasant but tables are way too close to each other. Its kinda like a foodcourt setup but with servers. 

I like the fact that despite not having reservations, we didn't have to wait for a very long time to be seated as we came early before dinner rush.

To be really honest, this place is overhyped and I probably wont go back again."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite Thai restaurants to date. Wish I had time to try out the dinner menu while I was in town but the lunch menu was great as well. Arrived late afternoon Friday to avoid some of the wait which worked in our favour. We only waited about 10-15mins for a table which is nothing for a very popular restaurant. Wait staff was friendly. The food was worth it. The Kung Tawt starter was amazing! Cooked to perfection. The main, the traditional Khao Soi was awesome and even better with the added pepper oil. Instead of dessert I opted for a drink, the plum mule, which was refreshing. It was the first stop on our visit to Toronto and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I don't get the raves. It's like people have never had good Thai before so the best of a mediocre bunch gets elevated to cult status. The space is fun, the food is good and well executed, but it's not mind blowing or amazing. It's good, not great. Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff, but my first choice (Gaeng Hunglay) wasn't available and I couldn't find anything that different from regular Thai food. In fact, despite being northern Thai, there was no larb or gai yang or pla som. I've been to Nuit's KSR and Sabai Sabai and enjoyed KSR's curries, but I wanted to avoid curries since this is northern Thai.

We had Pad Gra Prow and Khao Pla Tawt. The Pad Gra Prow was tasty and flavorful, w/ nice textural contrasts, but the flavor wasn't all that complex or deep. 

The Khao Pla Tawt was four pieces of well made, crispy basa. Basa's pretty flavorless so one sweetish and one spicy sauce are included. Mix the two together and there's where the flavor comes from. To mix things up, you can choose to use one sauce or the other or mix them up in varying amounts. That's where all the flavor variety comes from. 

This is a good place w/ a fun, communal atmosphere that would be great w/ a group of friends ordering different things and sharing. It gets crowded so make a reservation if you don't want to wait at the height of the dinner rush."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I love it ! The portion is a good size, the taste is amazing , and the decor is always on point. I love the variety of seatings from the stage (where you sets cross legged, bar, high table and low table.

The feels are amazing for a great chill place to eat with friends. The price is very reasonable and affordable. 

The only thing I would recommend is plan ahead and RSVP or be prepare to wait in line. It's always crowded ha"}
{"text":"I only go here for Thai food in Toronto.
Never had a bad experience with all the dishes I had tried so far...
But definitely get the squash fritters SO good!
Also, if you haven't tried the Thai iced tea yet get it! 
It PERFECT for dessert."}
{"text":"Been here many, many times, and have never had less than a 5-star experience, far from even one disappointment.
While the unique Northern Thai dishes they do are quite different from your generic Thai restaurant, the usual suspects like Green Curry, Massaman have a unique flavour about them too."}
{"text":"I'll keep this review real simple, think Khao San Road, but better! They take resos. The music is popping and it's huge. Queues were long on the Friday night I went, but since they take reservations I just watched  the masses line up.

Awesome appetizer menu, go for Grabong - squash fritters. Cucumber Collins with Hendricks, cucumber, lime juice, and soda is refreshing and pairs well with spicy dishes. 

Eat here."}
{"text":"This is apparently THE place of all places for Thai in Toronto! We were told it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait on a Wednesday night but we walked like 20 minutes to get there so we were staying. It ended up only being about 25 minutes until we were seated & I would say the food was worth it! Great Thai cuisine with great music and a cool location & atmosphere"}
{"text":"My mother and I walked in before catching a show at the Royal Alexander. They weren't taking reservations but since our party was small, we had no wait time. Fabulous service from all working there. The food was delicious, I had the Kaoh Pla Tawt and my mom had the chicken phad  thai. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing Food. Amazing Ambience. May be the best Thai food I've had in the city. Not suprised though. Sukothai and Kao San Road are also really good. Sense of authenticity and very flavourful. Didn't hurt that they were playing a 90s hip hop playlist when I was in there too! Excellent all around."}
{"text":"What a great spot! My friend and I had a very pleasant meal here, starting with the Laap salad served with lettuce leaves and sticky rice. It's a ground pork dish - I believe it's the national dish of Laos - with amazing flavours and texture, and just the right amount of spice. A great starter for two people. For my main I had the chicken Pad Thai which I thoroughly enjoyed. The portion was perfect - I even had leftovers to take home. My friend had the Pad Gra Prow, which is stir fried ground beef with basil and oyster sauce, served on jasmine rice and topped with a fried egg. She loved it.

Prices are very reasonable and atmosphere was nice. It's also a good place to take colleagues or clients for lunch. You probably want to make a reservation though as there was a line forming by 6 pm on a Friday. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After one visit to Pai you will feel cheated by all the other restaurants that you've had Pad Thai from...

The hype around this place was too crazy to ignore so I decided to investigate myself. With the rumoured long wait times, my friend and I decided it would be best to make a reservation for dinner. She called the restaurant because the only times showing up on their online booking system were way too late, but they just suggested that we come before 6:30 to see if there were any free tables.

We rushed over right after work and to our surprise, we were seated the moment we arrived (TIP: try to go before 6:30 if you can because this is when swarms of people start coming in). Pai was bustling and the interior of the restaurant resembled a street market in Asia - super unique! Though my friend and I had some difficulty carrying a conversation because of how loud the place was, we didn't mind because of how excited we were to try out the food.

We ordered the Pad Thai and Beef Pad Gra Prow after having it suggested by two different people.

Anywho, now on to how they tasted... Let's just take some time to give a round of applause to Pai's cooks. They were both just DIVINE. WOW. Portion-wise, the dishes were not too large but were just enough to share between the both of us. 

The Pad Thai was the best I've ever had in my life. I think I can leave it at that. The fact that I thoroughly enjoyed the Beef Pad Gra Prow really surprised me (I practically licked the plate clean) just because I am not a fan of beef. Each bite, however, seriously packed a punch and it was so delicious.

CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and tried the khao soi. I wasn't disappointed. Very flavorful. I got it with the hicken breast and it was a good portion of meat."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food in this place. A default if we're craving for some good Thai food in the city. The only drawback of the popularity is the long line up. You might want to come at odd hours."}
{"text":"We had returned from Thailand in October 2016, and we're feeling a bit nostalgic, so we heard to Pai Toronto for some Northern Thai.  

The restaurant is busy,  and I'm glad we got there early.  The menu seemed authentic.   The Thai Tea was delicious, and spot on.  

We both had the Khao Soi with chicken breast.  My husband found it perfect, but I found it a but too heavy on the curry.   The portions were generous for the price!   

The restaurant could be more comfy - the chairs and tables were cramped and uncomfortably so.  Waiters were friendly and efficient.   Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I like the food in general, but I don't love it.  And it is too expensive.  Yeah, this pretty much sums it up for me.

I can't say I have eaten Thai food in Thailand.  I compare Pai to the food I ate at a Thai restaurant that was run by a Thai family.  A mom/auntie cooked in the kitchen, and daughter and son worked the store front.  A mini spice tray was placed on every table.  I am used to bold flavours and oiliness from Thai food.  And the flavours be complex and mixed together.  

My conclusion was Pai has the best Thai curry in Toronto - the right texture, the right balance of flavours.  Tom Yum Kung soup was excellent.  It is a treat; I recommend it highly.  The eggrolls and satays were good shareable starters.  The Chef Nuit Pai Thai had a lot of good meat and seafood in it.  As far as the noodle part, it was down to earth with rich flavours.  This dish felt like a home-style food to me.  Gaeng Masaman with Braised Beef had complex flavours, but I found the chef was heavy handed with coconut milk. I wished there was more acidity in it to balance it.  The Khao Pla Tawt was a deep fried fish fillets with house dipping sauces.  The sauces were delicious.  The fish fillets were fresh.  It was good.  It was also nothing more special than plain deep fried fish fillets.  Unless you crave fish, otherwise, I would suggest you to skip this one.  

I ordered a variety of spice levels, from mild to Thai spicy.  I asked for Thai spicy and foreigner spicy for the soup and the Pad Thai, respectively.  I was given a small plate of chilli oil for both.  The soup tasted medium spicy only.  Pad Thai was not spicy, even after I requested it to be foreigner spicy. Does Pai make the food Thai/foreigner spicy or not?  The rest of the food was at medium spiciness.  Please believe me, medium spiciness was mildly spicy.

Services was impeccable and friendly.  We were given the bill without we asked for it, though.  And please tell me it is the location and the staff, because Thai food should not be this expensive.  Our bill was $135 for 4 people, all in.

I like it here, but not enough to call myself a fan. So 3.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a Thursday evening at around 8 pm. As soon as we walked in, the place was packed. Surprisingly, they had a table available and the waitress sat us down right away. 

The atmosphere was absolutely delightful. I really enjoyed the dim setting and the decor, which was very unique. The music was also fantastic.

We got an order of the spring rolls to share, and as my main, I ordered the Khao Soi with braised beef. Everything was super tasty and fresh, and I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves authentic Thai food. Pricing is very affordable as well."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has 4 stars, maybe we went on an off night for the chef but honestly I was not impressed by the food. The service was really slow as well, it took a long time for a waitress to take our order, and a while for the food to come.

We got:

Pad Thai with Chicken
Khao Pad Thamada with beef

The pad thai was similar to most take-out Thai places that I've had. It seemed to have a lot of sauce on it though because it felt like it was greasy. Honestly, it didn't taste amazing and was nothing special. The Khao Pad Thamada was not good at all. It reminded me of cheap Chinese-food style fried rice. I actually ended up asking for hot sauce to try and give it some flavor. My boyfriend didn't eat any of it, so there was a lot left over. 

The server DID notice we didn't eat too much of the rice and asked if we liked it. We said we didn't like it too much. She actually let the chef know, so the chef tasted it and also said it wasn't too good.  They took it off our bill! That was really nice and unexpected since we didn't complain about it and had intended on paying for it.

I really feel bad giving only 2 stars because our waitress was so nice about the rice, but honestly the food was not good and I would not return. There are other Thai places downtown that I would rather go back to."}
{"text":"AMAZING authentic Thai food!  Wow!!! as a traveler it was such a pleasant surprise to find great authentic food and vibrant happy noises around ya after a tiring day of being tourists. We loved everything and could not stop raving about the chicken wings! Best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Green curry with chicken was absolutely the best I've had. I've traveled a lot and this no different than what you'd find in Thailand. Service was outstanding even with out two bratty kids being disruptive."}
{"text":"Woot woot!   Who loves amazing Thai food?   This lady.  

Pai is the best Thai in the city.  Granted, Toronto has pretty subpar Thai options so one often settles within the \"you get what you get\" scenario.    Regardless, PAI deserves every accolade and praise it receives.  

Former Chef of Khao San Road opened this place approx 1.5 yrs ago and it offers all the yumminess without any of the attitudes.  Examples, you can actually make a reservation, you can be seated if not all of your party is there yet, servers aren't striving to get points on each other by prove how nasty they can be (sorry, that is my anti KSR bias showing). 

The food is amazing.  I love spicy food and this place delivers if you ask for spicy.

Things I particularly love; it is a perfect spot for veggies and omnivores alike (not sure about vegans), the atmosphere almost feels like you are coming home.   

I am a creature of habit and continue to love their red Thai curry.  Delicious, delicious, delicious"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday and this place is packed. The wait time for two to eat is only about 10 minutes and well worth it.

Food: SOOO TASTY and unique. Seriously - really flavorful and well presented.  Come hungry!

Service: For a place this busy, it is what it is.  You aren't going to get a beaming waiter - you are going to place your order and hope they get it right.  They did for us and that was the most we could ask for.

Price: Not bad for what you get.

Decor: It is really really cramped in here.  Tables are on top of other tables.  I was hitting my elbow against the next table as I tried to eat my noodles. But its clean enough. With the wait, you're just happy you got a spot to eat.

Noteable extras: None"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Pai while visiting Toronto from the states for a few days for our wedding anniversary on the recommendation of one of the bartenders at Barhop. We had the shrimp thamada and it was incredible. Mike (manager?) talked with us for about 20 minutes about the history, the food, and other food recommendations in the city. He was super nice. We liked it so much we decided to back for our anniversary dinner a couple days later. We of course had the shrimp thamada again, and the shrimp curry served in a coconut. Again, incredible. The cocktails were super tasty. I loved the summer dog with lychee juice. The only negative is that we'll have to drive 5.5 hours to have it again!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding maybe the best I've had excellent quality. I went twice my first 2 days visiting from NYC both times top notch."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I know exactly what to expect, and I'm never disappointed. The food is great, their coconut milk curry is delicious, so flavourful but also very simple. Staff are nice, prices are good, and overall I highly recommend the place for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Wanted to have dinner here with a friend at 8pm on Saturday. We were told that the wait would be an hour + so we decided to wait and have a drink elsewhere meanwhile.  An hour and 20 minutes later we went back since we had not yet been called. I had to go straight to the host (felt terrible about bypassing the line-up) and we did get seated right away. 

I've been to PAI various times before - always love the atmosphere- but I was highly disappointed by the food this time. Got a chicken skewer app. Which was great then had to wait 20 more minutes for the mains - my Pad Thai noodles were burnt and that taste stayed with me the rest of the night. To mess up the most basic dish at a Thai restaurant is terrible. 

I didn't complain because by this point I had already waited 1hr + 20 minutes  to sit and 30 minutes for the main. Just was too hungry to wait any longer for them to replace the dish. 

Suffice it to say I was unimpressed enough that I'm going to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pad gra praw was so good! It has a good amount of spice, and the crispy pork and fried egg brought it to the next level"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best thai food I've had in Toronto. 

Was craving some authentic thai during a 2 month stay in the beautiful Toronto during winter. This place does it. It's in a super cool spot (although parking is a pain), with a playful menu, but the flavors are 10/10. 

Love the curry noodles and beef stew and pad thai. The shredded pork with rice and egg are a must! Order everything if your wallet allows, portions are not that big. Cocktails are strong and tasty. 

We went late afternoon and there was no wait. Service was a little slow and prices are a little high though but I will be back for more each visit!"}
{"text":"Once in a while you eat at a place while visiting a city that makes you momentarily contemplate moving there just so you could eat that food.  This was the case on my visit to Toronto, and the restaurant was Pai.  I got the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup,l and the wing appetizer, but it was a tough call picking something out because so much of the menu looked great and authentic.  The beef noodle soup was packed with flavor complexity - a hallmark of northern Thai cuisine.  Getting this on a chilly night hit the spot.  5/5 for sure"}
{"text":"So I would easily rank Pad Thai as one of my favorite foods of all time, which means I tend to order it anytime I spot it on a menu. The Pad Thai at Pai is easily one of the best in the city (if not the best), especially since the demise of the great Khao San Road.

We started with an order of the Spring Rolls (\"Deep fried Vegetarian Spring Rolls filled with mushrooms, glass noodles, carrots and sprouts\") and they were a cut above, to be sure. They arrived to the table piping hot and accompanied with a tasty dipping sauce. I wouldn't say these were the best spring rolls I've ever had, but they certainly hit the spot.

For my main, I of course went with the Chef Nuit Pad Thai (\"Stir fried rice noodle in a home made tamarind sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts\") and I ordered it Phet Mak Mak (thai spicy). (And they were definitely not kidding around with the spice!)

The dish is plentiful and delicious, and benefits from a seriously impressive layering of flavors. Just when you think you've discovered all the tastes that the dish has to offer, you take another bite that's bursting with flavors you hadn't noticed before. I mean this is a seriously tasty dish.

My one complaint would be that the service wasn't that great. If I'm ordering a plate of food at the spiciest level that you offer, I do expect you to be hovering nearby with a jug of water at all times. (As it was, my small glass was refilled only once.)"}
{"text":"I don't think I can say more than what's already been said. The food is yummy, quick and not very expensive. The staff are cool and polite and the place really reminds me of Thailand (when I was there about 5 years ago). Last time I was there, I ate at the bar and chatted with the bartender. He was really cool. 

Warning: this place gets super packed and the wait can be long, eventhough there is a quick customer turn-over. Still worth the wait (eat at the bar)."}
{"text":"Food is great, I can feel the different types of curry, I really enjoyed their coconut curry and their pad Thai. However, the soup was way too sugary and way below average standards.

Another problem is if you sit in the concealed corner with a lot of candles, it makes it a hard environment to breathe."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find on my last night in Toronto. Tired of eating my own cooking, i went on a walk about and found this unassumingly named restaurant with a modest front. I stepped in to find a line waiting a 5:45pm for a seat. The place is in the basement of a larger building and was packed. Once i ate my food i understood why. Balanced flavors with great Thai seasoning and spice. The cool Sapporo beer hit the spot, too.  I ordered the PGB Moo Grob with pan seared and fried pork, jasmine rice, and a large fried egg on top. Make sure you pour the fish sauce on top. Fantastic. Thank you for a great end to my trip!!!!"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5

Waited about 30-40 mins on a Friday night. They didn't have the chicken skewers so we decided to get the Thai chicken wings($6 for 3). They were good but very small like pub wings and they were nothing special. For the main dishes we got khao soi and curry in coconut dish. With the hype of the Khao soi, I didn't find it anything special. The noodles were very soggy and the sauce was very oily. The curry in coconut however was very tasty. Overall it's definitely worth trying it out for the more authentic side of Thai food.

Note:
- place is very loud and gets pretty crowded
- make a reservation online or else you'll have to wait a bit"}
{"text":"Was here on a Friday evening for dinner, waited about half an hour for a table. The area beside the main bar is now a waiting area (was wondering why at first). Then after realized, the restaurant expanded. The waiter brought us to the other side of the other side of the restaurant which is the quieter side. The decor was really nice with the lights and the space is bigger than khao san road. As for the food, I think it went downhill compared to before. Maybe because the space is bigger now? Ordered the spring rolls--3/5, not freshly made. The Satay Skewers- 3/5, the meat was too soft. The  Beef Pad Thai- 3/5, not as much flavour compared to before."}
{"text":"Authentic for sure, here is what I ordered

Khao Sai - Beef- just okay, the noodles were kinda hard, but not in a good way, the beef was TOO rich, not my style. The sauce was salty and you could taste the shrimp.

Pad thai - wonderful! if you're here get it but don't go out of your way for it

Green curry chicken, very authentic - reminded me of the green curry we would eat on the beach in thailand but again most places get this right. 

the lineup to get int was a good 45 minutes, the drinks are expensive. 

I probably won't be going back and if I do i'll stick to the pad thai."}
{"text":"Taste: 5
Service: 5
Value: 4
Presentation: 5
Overall: 4.6 rounded up to 5

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. I made a reservation about 2 months ago and it's been a very very long time since I last tried this place. Starting off we have the grabong which are fried buttercup fritters. I saw everybody ordering it so it must've been a popular choice. And for the main we have the chicken chef nuit pad thai. Let's dive right into the review.

Wow does the appetizer look big; piled up as high as it can go. The crispiness of it lathered with sweet garlic tamarind dip really enhanced the flavour. I was however most excited for their main dish. Don't underestimate the size, once I mixed the pad thai it filled the entire plate. I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles and the flavour was just perfect, in comparison to many pad thai places where the pad thai is pretty bland. I felt like I could taste the texture of each individual noodle in my mouth. My girlfriend mentioned that this place serves pad thai as authentic you can get compared to what they served in Thailand. Now that's pretty impressive! My girlfriend wanted to take the pictures this time because she says I take unflattering photos. I just wanted to mention to not pay attention to the smudge on the bottom left of the pad thai picture. That is definitely not her finger :P

Being as busy as they were, the staff were very friendly and we enjoyed a nice conversation with them. Being an asian restaurant I wanted to see if they would refill my water when I finished drinking it. To my surprise, they did without me asking!

The whole meal came out to approx $60 for two pad thais and the grabong. Generally, I would say this is on the pricier side of Toronto pad thai places, but comparing the portion size and the quality of the food it was pretty worth it in my opinion.

All in all, I think this is one of the best pad thai places in Toronto and I will make another reservation again. I wouldn't come on the weekends though as even on a Tuesday the wait would still be over 30 minutes unless you don't mind waiting. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"A tiny bit pricey (but not enough to drop a star), but definitely worth it for the quality of food, service , atmosphere and drinks.

It was super busy when we arrived, but the hostess advised only a 20 minute wait, which was more like 5 anyway!

We had two DeMartinis, Pai's limey and tart version of the gin classic, with a kaffir lime leaf for an added hipster vibe. They were super refreshing and a great start to the meal. They did have an interesting array of cocktails, around $10 CAD each.

The appetiser selection was so broad. We were tempted to just order from this section but the mains were also incredible. We got Moo Ping (typical Thai street food dish of grilled pork skewers) which was succulent and delicious. This went perfectly with the Som Tum (spicy green papaya salad) with the sweet, salty and spicy combinations.

It was hard to choose the mains. There were a lot of dishes that reminded me of my trip to Thailand but we ended up settling with some great choices: one I've had before and a new dish entirely. Pad Ga Pow (spicy chicken with Hoyle basil, Thai fried egg and rice) and Gaeng Masaman (peanut and tamarind based curry with rice). Both of these dishes were exceptional, with hugely different flavours which gave us a well rounded dining experience.

We did eat a bit too much that we didn't have any space for dessert. They did have mango sticky rice (my favourite!) I honestly couldn't eat another mouthful.

I can't wait to come back to Toronto just to visit Pai again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place on a recent visit. The fried fish was surprisingly tasty. Khao soi was delicious. Sangria added a nice touch to this lunch. Hear it gets pretty slammed for dinner so lunch might be better."}
{"text":"Pai is one of the best Thai food places I've been to in Canada. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan (green curry) is fantastic and comes in a fresh coconut! The mango sticky rice for dessert is also phenomenal; however, the last time we ordered it it was the end of the night and I think I had been made earlier in the day as it was quite dry and not at all warm.
Overall, the food is always fresh and the service is always efficient and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is very busy, and it is busy for a reason. The ambiance is nice and the food is affordable and delicious. I love the Crispy Basa Fillet dish. The sauce is fantastic! I am not a fan of curry and I actually enjoyed the Khao soi dish (Fresh egg noodles in golden curry) I will definitely go back and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"I had the best chicken wings ever here. The food is great but the wait can be a pain in the butt. But it's totally worth trying."}
{"text":"I live very close to this place so I've done a number of take aways and never disappointed with the food.
While I've never been to Khao san road myself (since they do not take reservations), people used to say Khao san road was closer to authentic Thai food. It's unfortunate that place closed down.
This place isn't the brightest lit place but you can still make out the menu and can be rowdy, but maintain a conversation with someone across the table without losing your voice.
Their reservations can be ridiculous so if it's for a special occasion you may have to book at least a month or two in advance or get there much earlier than intended time to eat."}
{"text":"Really good food and atmosphere. It's my go to place in this area when you want something a little nicer than a pub or sports bar, but don't want to spend an arm and a leg. Would be a good date place I think."}
{"text":"Best Thai Place Ever !! The green curry is to die for :)"}
{"text":"- I have tried so many Thai restaurants, including Khao San Road, I have to say Pai is my favourite so far. What I have tried:
   + Chef Nuit Pad Thai: omg this dish is AMAZING, so much better than the one at Khao San Rd. It is the most flavourful pad thai I have ever tried. I got it with beef, but the meat came out a bit dry, I would recommend it with chicken or maybe pork. 
   + Gang Kiaw Wan in a coconut: basically green curry in coconut, I ordered it with fish since I never had curry with fish before. The curry was herby and so authentic. Other curries I have tried at different Thai restaurant are either salty or sweet. This curry gave a hint of coconut but not too strong, very savoury. The fish fillet was soft but there were not many pieces of fish :( 
   + Pad Gra Prow: I ordered this just because it's so popular on yelp. However I have to say this dish was the biggest disappointment out of all I have tried. It's just rice and minced pork with a side of fish sauce (not even better than rice with grilled meat from Vietnamese restaurant). The fish sauce was so tasteless, I think it's because not all people can endure the smell of it. The pork had ok flavour, overall nothing about this dish impressed me.
- Portion: HUGE omg, don't be fooled by my picture, one dish can fill one person up. My bf and I thought the portion would be the same as Khao San so we went for three dishes and had struggle to walk in the end
- Price: a bit more on the pricey side but it's worth it, trust me you need to give it a try, you won't be disappointed 
- Great and fast customer service. I reccommend to reserve the table on their website, otherwise you have to spend up to 1-2 hours lining up outside."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best recommendation we received when we traveled to Toronto. Can not recommend this place enough. Our next trip North will be centralized around dinner here. Be prepared for a lengthy, but worthwhile wait if you do not make a reservation. Very affordable meals with average priced cocktails for Toronto."}
{"text":"Not really price worthy of a place. Decoration price took a toll on quality of food serve here."}
{"text":"Top notch flavor. Really seriously delicious pad thai and khao soi. I come here all the time for takeout.

But don't even bother trying to get a seat cuz you'll be waiting for an hour on a normal weeknight.

Inside, it's really well decorated and lively. But also SUPER LOUD, so not suited for intimate conversations or catchups with old friends."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had! Very flavorful. 
I wish they had better choices of beer and that the noise level was lower. But that still doesn't take away from the excellent taste of the food"}
{"text":"This is a place I keep going back to.  The food is excellent. This is not your typical Thai place.  The food is out of this world. Every time I come in, I choose something different. And I'm always pleasantly surprised at the flavor.  You have to make a reservation as this place is very popular.  Well worth the effort."}
{"text":"Overall I really like this place. I LOVE Thai food and I'm very picky when it comes to flavor and spice.

Got 2 orders of the Thai wings to start. And a sangria to drink (delicious)

I ordered the pad Thai with shrimp and a side of crispy pork on the side. There's 5 level of spicy I got the 4th one. I wasn't sure how spicy I wanted it, even though I love spicy I want to be able to enjoy it.

The good was spicy BUT it wasn't too spicy. The server was nice enough to bring me a side of their super spicy chili oil, which then made it super super spicy. which I didn't mind because at least I didn't get it all over my food. I like to control my spicyness if I have an option lol. 


We waited about 40/50mins for a table, which wasn't too bad. I was set to eating here so we waited. Make sure to check in with the host every 20/30 min cuz even though they said they'll text you when your table is ready sometimes they forget."}
{"text":"Great service and food. The sangria was excellent and the pad Thai was unbelievable   I would come back!!"}
{"text":"Was my first time there with a bunch of girlfriends. We ordered the spring rolls, fritters and the chicken satay. Some of us also got the Thai iced tea! The apps were really good and authentic. I loved their sauces. For mains I ordered the green curry with tofu and veggies. It came in a young coconut, with steam rice. The portions were fairly decent but the flavour of the green curry wasn't something I have not had before, so I would say it was good. We didn't wait too long to be seated (10 min or so) and the service with food was pretty good too. Overall a good vibe and fun place to hang out! Can be a bit loud, so be aware of that."}
{"text":"Been wanting to take my hubby here for awhile now and we finally made it!

We were so lucky that we were able to get seated right away on a Wednesday night with no reservation. Part of it was because they have now expanded their location so there is a back part that you can also now sit at. Perfect for private parties if anyone is looking :p

There is another bar in the back and we choose to be seated at the bar so there was no waiting time. If we wanted a table, it was still a quick wait - 15-20 mins (not bad for Pai).

Since we finally made it here, we tried to order as much as we could without looking like pigs (:P)

We tried:
- thai wings
- Grabong (buttercup squash fritters)
- Som Tum Tad (Papaya Salad) with Salted Crab
- Pad Thai
- Gang Kiaw Wan (in a coconut): green curry

the wings are very flavourful - really good. 
The grabong is light and not oily and HUGE. Definitely a sharing item

We were disappointed with the papaya salad as it was very fishy tasting and the crab was not that great... it made it even more fishy. But we wanted to try the crab since we have not seen it on other menus before.

as always, the pad thai was amazing. the green curry was really good too, it's so cute that they serve it in a coconut...

We were too full to have dessert, so can't comment about that!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried many Thai places in Toronto, but I was born and raised in Chicago. When it comes to food I'm critical. Pai indeed lives up to my expectations! Taste and quality is amazing. It's reasonable priced especially during lunch hour. I always get my pad Thai with tea ross, but green curry is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Stop reading now and just head over there!

I've always liked Thai food. Like that super-basic white people version of Green Curry Chicken you get anywhere, even at like Jack Astors or Milestones. Then we travelled to Thailand. And I realized how far that was from REAL Thai food.
Not unlike the stuff we call Chinese food in Canada, which isn't really Chinese food. It's just food cooked by Chinese people to appeal to people who like popcorn chicken covered is cherry sundae topping.

Back to Pai. This restaurant is like a time machine that took us back to our honeymoon in Thailand. The food is just loaded with all these intense, unusual flavours that evoke strong memories. The food at Pai is authentic. The atmosphere is authentic. The service is authentic (like how nice are Thai people? They're best, all over Thailand.) I'd highly recommend this place to anyone whether you like Thai food or not- because it's an experience. Praise the people who run this spot because they've clearly put so much thought and effort into sharing their culture with Toronto.

Oh, and checkout the Monday Night Market. What a cool vibe!"}
{"text":"Step into Pai and feel as though you've just been swept away to a beachy vacation. I had the Green Curry which was served in a coconut - amazingly fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Such a good buzz in this place. It's almost always busy, so be aware that the wait can be long at peak times. It's hard to find a sit-down place walkable from the business district that's both fun and casual -- let alone one with great thai food. Oh -- a good tap list, too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The best pad Thai and the Thai iced tea is a little sweet but so nice with the spicy food! Favourite Thai in the downtown area"}
{"text":"Really nice, fresh Thai street food in a casual atmosphere.  Lots of fun!"}
{"text":"A lot of fun, great food, but the noise level was a bit much and made it feel like a place where one scarfs food down and then exits fast.  It's cavernous two, more than 100 seats easily. The papaya salad was great: explosion of flavour in the mouth; we opted for salted crab with ours -- whole pieces, shell and all, which might not be to everyone's taste. The chchirones and prawn crackers that come with the dish are perfect. The best dish was the pork pad gra prow, nicely flavored ground pork with rice and a runny fried egg.  The Khao Soi disappointed:  egg noodles in a very rich, maybe overly rich, lightly curried coconut soup with shrimp (one can also order this with chicken or beef) . Staff were very good, but the ambiance, or utter lack thereof, kills it.  Maybe good for takeout though.  Nice to see they have locally brewed Izumi sake on tap.

Chris Nuttal-Smith more or less nailed it in his Globe review:  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/with-respect-and-disappointment-pai-northern-thai-kitchen-serves-some-of-the-best-thai-in-toronto/article19970065/"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! Walked in and had to wait 20mins for a table. Went to the bar across the street in the meantime. Squash fritters are to die for!!! Had the Khao Soi with chicken- chicken melted in my mouth. Hands down the best Thai food I've ever eaten"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Tasty & close to authenticity. Nice cozy ambience. Good service. Serving is just a bit small for the price. Overall i enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great location, but very long lines.

Notable mentions include the pad thai, khao soi, thai milk tea, and mango sticky rice. There's a Pai Market at the back, where you can purchase some goods. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Thai restaurants that I have ever been to.. this place is always busy and there is wait time at any given hour unless you are super early. tried their fried rice and pad Thai ..both are amazing and also did a few take out orders which tasted nothing different than a dine-in. Overall they keep up the quality of food and serve the same all the time!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating here. Always a hard time making reservations or getting a seat here."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful spot for Thai food. The wait wasn't long and the waiting area had access to the bar. The food was delicious and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! OMG, I want to introduce this place to everyone I know. I had Miang Kham here for the first time. I never knew something can be so flavourful. It's such a combination of different flavours and textures in just one single bite. Tom yam soup is one of the best in the city I've ever had. And dishes related to curry are just amazing. No wonder there is always a lineup.
I also love the atmosphere. The decoration just take me right to Bangkok."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The only thing I would not recommend is the oxtail. The green curry and chicken wings were amazing!"}
{"text":"tucked away in a basement in toronto's downtown core, this dim and busy northern thai haunt truly lives up to the absurd hype that it gets.  the decor evokes a street market-type of feel, and the menu definitely reflects that - just a bunch of delicious items that feel like they're meant to be purchased from and eaten on the streets of north thailand.  i also have no credibility since i've never been to thailand.  plenty of staff are employed here, and i've never had an issue with the service.

i've thoroughly enjoyed most of what i've tried here.  i'm not really impressed with the pad thai - it's not bad, but isn't as good everything else i've had.  i highly recommend: grabong (fried sliced squash fritters), som tum tad (papaya salad), khao soi, gaeng kiaw wan (green curry served in a coconut :o), gaeng hunglay (ox tail curry), pad gra pow, and the khao pad tamada.  all dishes are visually appealing, and are loaded with tons of flavours that all blend together really well.

my only gripe is that even though the portions are good, all of the dishes are a bit expensive.  knock a dollar off each item and this place would be perfect.

dine here on off-hours if possible, as it gets absolutely packed around lunch and dinner time"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for this restaurant for quite sometime now. No matter what adjectives I use, I would be regurgitating the countless praises that have already been sung.

I have been here for more than 30 times till date and have tried all the dishes (barring beef and pork varieties). I am yet to experience disappointment - be it the service, dishes, drinks, the restaurant is top notch. The flavors are authentic and presentation is neat. Regardless of what you try on the menu, you will be impressed, and will be rearing to come back for more. I do. 

I had introduced this restaurant to at least 5 of my friends and they have all been fans. 

I just love the place and, needless to say, I will remain a fan for life!

A tip: if you are in the area for lunch, do stop by for a quick grab-n-go from the Market (11:30 am - 2:30 pm weekdays). It's a good option if you are a 'Thai Express for lunch' kind of a guy. You get a great tasting zero-wait-time lunch for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Had the Khao Soi, a coconut drink, and the mango sticky rice dessert. Enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"My all time fav Thai food...my fav is turnip fries & their green coconut curry with braised beef. The layout is great & entertaining as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the food and atmosphere! We ordered Green Curry beef and Shrimp Pad Thai. Great value and fast service too! We are delighted!"}
{"text":"Pai is the best Thai Restaurant in Toronto! So stop reading and go!

If you're still reading, then I might as well tell you why it's the best. The food is authentic, fresh and flavourful. The cocktails are great, and the decor has a really cool vibe that's welcoming yet different at the same time. 

If you're looking for a bit of a different experience, they have 1 Northern Thai style low table where you sit on the ground leaving against triangular pillows. Always a conversation starter!

As for the food, my favorites are the 'Khao Soi', a soupy bowl of curry with meat, egg noodles and crispy fried onions; and the 'Pad Gra Prow', stir fried ground meat topped with a fried egg covered in tasty thai spices. Both are rarely done right and always a good choice at Pai.

Word of caution, everybody knows it the best and therefore, the lines can get ridiculous. So prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Got the Pad Thai to go because it was a packed house with a hour wait on a Wednesday evening. It wasn't to die for but I blame part of it on the fact that I got it to go. Definitely going to try eating in when I get the chance."}
{"text":"This restaurant is all quality. My favourites: pad thai, Tom yum soup and green curry. They're incredibly busy, but the waitress was always attentive when I grabbed her attention. I can't express just how much their food is so flavourful, filling and so worth it! Usually I wouldn't do delivery/take-out, but because they're so busy, I'd rather do take out just to get their food faster. 

I went on Halloween and all the wait staff wore very adorable costumes. It feels like a family in there!

Love it! I will be back!"}
{"text":"The interior is similar to a dive restaurant. It's fairly clean with a mix of high seat tables or regular tables. Having come on a friday night at 8:30pm it was quite busy. The wait was well over 45min, but the server said he could text me when my table was ready. Luckily my friend suggested we sit at the bar as the servers had no problem serving food there. We got our menus and have to say that this place is a little more on the expensive side. It won't break the bank, but can you put that much added value?

We got the Gaeng Hunglay - Ox Tail, Pad Thai, and chicken skewers. the food came out really quick even though the restaurant was so busy. The skewers tasted great and it came with peanut sauce and a sweet/vinegar based dip with thai chili's inside. The peanut sauce was well made and authentic instead of taking a glop of peanut butter and blending it with some hot sauce. The vinegar based sauce tasted great as well and my friend practically drank the sauce. The pad thai tasted as expected, the portion wasn't too big, but satisfying. A good mix of chicken, sprouts and everything else evenly throughout. Nothing stood out from it and the \"foreigner spicy\" translated to mild. The Gaeng Hunglay was something else though, think curry, but a little sweeter and hints of ginger. I thoroughly enjoyed that dish more then the pad thai 

Thai cuisine doesn't have a lot of expensive ingredients, the pad thai costs around 15$ and it wasn't special or outstanding enough for me to order it again. However, the Ox tail was delicious and if I were to come again and I would definitely order something along those lines.For authenticity this place would be 4.5/5 for Thai cuisine"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try one of the popular northern Thai places while I was in town but seeing as we didn't have any reservations, I didn't think we had a good chance of getting into Pai. But then again, it was an early Thursday evening so we gave it a shot. Turns out we got to Pai just before the dinner rush and we're able to put our name down on the list before it got crazy. The wait was only 25-30 minutes!

The inside had me reminiscing about my travels back in Chiang Mai. The decor is a nice balance between cool hipster and Thai market/street food style. The place is bustling, the crowd young and filled with chatter. If you can, sit out on their patio outside.

So many cool drinks. They even have Thai buckets! The whole menu sounded delicious. We were having a hard time narrowing it down to three dishes for the two of us. Four spice levels to choose from! Mild, medium, farang (foreigner spicy) and phet mak mak (Thai spicy). Genius.

- Grabong ($12.50) - vegetarian deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip. Seemed like everyone around us was getting this as their starter so we did the same. The squash fritters were piled high - nicely battered and crunchy but the dip is what makes this dish. Magic. Wish they had a half size option as this dish is massive and way too much for two people to share.

- Chef Nuit pad thai ($15.00) - stir fried rice noodle in a homemade tamarind sauce with bean sprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. Noodles had a nice chewy texture to them and the tamarind sauce was perfect. Not too sweet, tangy. This was pretty legit.

- Gaeng hunglay ox tail ($15.00) - sweet and sour ox tail ginger curry. Served with steamed jasmine rice. Ox tail is always good in my books but I don't think I've ever had it Thai style. The curry was rich and heavy but the ginger helped cut down the richness somewhat. Meat was succulent and tender but there was a bit more bone that I would have liked.

We rolled out of Pai stuffed to the brim but extremely satisfied with our meal. Next time, I'll be sure to bring more friends out to try way more things. I'd be happy to eat my way through Pai's menu!"}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner and were surprised by a waiting line for those (like us) who thought that reservations weren't necessary a bit before 5PM.  After a reasonable wait, we were seated and, having read the reviews and checked out the menu online, ordered right away.  The grabang squash fritters were good if a tad greasy, but the Singha beers ordered to go with them never arrived.  Our busy waitperson was apparently covering too many tables, thought we had the beers, and questioned if we were getting for a second round when we asked where they were.  That was the only glitch in service from an otherwise attentive and personable server.  The Chiang Ma beef noodle soup and the Khao Sol with beef were both worthy of five stars. Would we go back?  Most certainly.  The ambience isn't great, but the food is excellent by any measure."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants!!! Food is amazing, beer is great, service is awesome. Always recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"We were there Saturday night,  around 7:00. Once we are there,  30 people outside waiting in line. We waited approximately a hour and 15 minutes and it was worth it. Thai tea was excellent,  not too sweet and very refreshing. Khao Soi with braised beef was excellent. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  I will definitely coming back next time I am in town.  Best authentic Thai food I ever had."}
{"text":"Very good green curry! The coconut milk really brought out the flavours. Did not like the mandatory 20% tip!"}
{"text":"Get ready to wait in line. Why is this place so damn busy every time! Must have some exceptional dishes, but I've yet to try them."}
{"text":"A pleasant restaurant for a relaxing date for valentines day

I can see why this restaurant is often compared with khao san road due to its similarities in the menu and its location. However, the taste of the food, environment and service are completely different. 

I found that Pai Northern had an amazing atmosphere compared to khao san road where the waiters do not provide polite service and dont even get me started on those lineups for such a tiny restaurant. Its freezing outside! 

Once inside, the lighting and mood was a lot more relaxed. I liked how every table had their own little candlelight and everything was clean. Couple had their own table and I could hear my girlfriend without having to shout. I ordered the Pad Thai and she ordered the Khao Soi (I think that's how its spelt) and both of it came in great portions. 

The flavour was amazing my pad thai had perfect combinations of spice, sweetness and crunch that it wasn't overwhelming but balanced. This was very filling and I can imagine many people not being able to finish this dish on their own. 

For the two dishes, we paid somewhere around $33 dollars and I would love to come back and try the coconut green curry. All in all, I felt that this was definitely the better alternative than khao san road."}
{"text":"Delicious food at affordable prices. The atmosphere was great. The only downfall is wait time both for seats and food."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai in a super cool setting. You enter into to the restaurant head downstairs and observe that it is definitely a popular place. We were very fortunate to get a table on walk in. The crowd is very Toronto downtown. Urban, many young professionals and people looking and sounding like they were having a good time. It sure was a boisterous place. The scents in the air of coconut curry's and delicious Thai food get the salivary glands dripping. 

What I came here with laser focus was to try the Khao Soi. Where I live in MTL Khao Soi is pretty much non existent. The creamy flavours and spices is what I was seeking. Man oh man was it decadent, rich a bit sweeter than I've had it before however delicious non the less. We really enjoyed the dish. Also we had ordered the chicken satay and a Pad Thai (which my daughter could eat some). The satay was creamy and the peanut sauce I could lick the serving plate clean it was that good. However I try to keep some composure especially in a fine dining establishment such as this. The pad Thai was creamy as well. Overall everything was good. I'd agree with another reviewer that they tend to put a bit more sugar in the dishes here as people tend to enjoy this more in North America. It was decadent and rich.

Service was really friendly and accommodating. At first they put us at a table in the corner. Than another table opened up sitting cross legged style and we asked if we could move to this. The accommodated and it was appreciated. Lots of very interesting nice Thai accents through out the restaurant. Definitely a winner and high quality Thai food!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food i ever had in my life must go there and eat they have a waiting area that has a bar that serves drinks until your table ready . Watch your step on the way in."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai Food!

This is as real as it gets in the city! Note: if you do not have a spice tolerance, make sure you choose conservatively when you choose your spice level.

The green curry is delicious, creamy and full of veggies and meat. When it comes in the young coconut, it is beautiful, and the young coconut adds a beautiful spice break and richness to the dish.

The red curry with beef is SUPER flavourful and delicious, there are both fried noodles and boiled noodles in this dish which are a beautiful textural component. The dish is incredibly filling.

The pad thai was delicious and very flavourful and served fresh and hot (noodles were chewy and not overdone at all). The chicken wings were delicious with their sauce and the different spices and herbs made is super yummy with strong thai flavours. 

The mojito type drink (cannot remember the name, but it had mint, gin and citrus) was very good, but a little on the sweeter side. The seasonal coconut ice cream was to die for (I was already bursting but somehow managed to pack it in on account of how delicious it was). 

Service was good and the ambience is cute (though not necessarily thai). There are cure sitting areas at the front, but the place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Yum! Okay this place doesn't need any more reviews. It's got tons!!! Just make reservations, get your butt over here, and order the lemongrass iced tea and chicken pad Thai. Awesome meal for $20. So good! Love the chill vibes too. Place gets crowded and busy so if you don't like noise or people, you may not like the setting. In that case, get delivery!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I loved the vibe and food.

Staff: They were really attentive at clearing away dishes. Offered us great suggestions as to their most popular dishes.

Ambience: It's definitely got a street-vibe and I was totally digging it. There's plenty of space but don't expect any luxurious seating. It was pretty loud but I'm used to places like that.

Food: I had the Gai Satay which were basically chicken skewers and they were so delicious! I know they're just skewers but the chicken was so tender and juicy and just melted off with flavour. For my main, I decided to see their version of a dish a commonly order, Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken. It was not the best Pad Thai I've ever had, but it was still good. I think next time I'll opt to try one of their curries though (I had a taste of my friends' and they were all very tasty).

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, can be a little loud inside but it adds to the ambiance.

Can't go wrong ordering anything off the menu - food and drinks are outstanding"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken fried rice. Big portion but a bit oily side if you are very health conscious. I like it anyways. Curry on the sweet side, but that's the same for every Thai restaurant, just not my style."}
{"text":"Found the curry a bit oily, 1 cm of grease on top of the curry.  Flavourwise, it was ok, but nothing that jumps out at you. The spice/herb flavours are also bit muddled."}
{"text":"Pai is amazing.  Based on the reviews you'e seeing, you know it's an extremely busy place.  Going to Pai on a Friday night at 7 pm is probably your dumbest decision ever but it's well worth the wait.  (Try going at 5:30 ish to beat the rush). Here are a few things that we've gotten in the past: 

DRINKS: 
a) Thai iced tea - YES YES YES!!! GET IT.  It is this ridiculously sweet caffeinated, ridiculously yummy tea.  The first time the bf wanted to share it..yeah he didn't get any. 

APPETIZERS: 
a) Grabong - omg YES. YES. YES. Get it.  It is delicious and the one menu item that is actually great for sharing even though you'll not want to share it! 

b) Miang Kung - it was great and flavourful but really it was a very small appetizer.  I didn't think it was worth the $15 we paid for it.  It was barely shareable and just the fact that it was so overpriced just turned me off. 

MAINS: 
a) Pad Thai - this is my ultimate favourite dish of all at Pai.  I could eat this until I died and then eat it after I died and eat it after I reincarnate.  Main point being...yes, it's delicious.  Definitely get it.  It's one of the best pad thai's I've EVER had. 

b) Gaeng Masaman w/ beef - This was good and flavourful but it wasn't mind blowing.  The beef was yummy and the sauce was good.  It's worth a try b/c it's a very traditional Thai dish. 

c) Pad Gra Prow - This was also a delicious item that I would get again.  We had it with pork and it was a good amount of spice and flavour.  It's also another item on the menu that is a must get. 

d) Khao Soi - unfortunately, I was not impressed with this dish.  Maybe it was an off day but the noodles didn't taste good at all and the chicken drumstick was very flavourless.  I would not get this menu from the item and this and the Gaeng Masaman are the reasons why this place is not receiving 5 stars.  

DESSERTS: 
I wish I were not dying of fullness by the end of each meal so that I could order dessert.  Alas, I have nothing for you."}
{"text":"The food is great here! 4 Stars and not 5 because they are always busy. I ordered my khao soi via Ritual app, it took 45 mins...I think that's a little long considering they stuff is already made they just scoop it up...you can see it when you pay at the back. Also ordering via the app..my noodle portion was way smaller then eating there...it was half the portion. Also if you like the chips that they give you, you can order a bag. It's not on the menu but the charge around $5.00 for a bag the sauce is amazing. must get. Definitely one of my favorite thai restaurants in town."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai restaurants in the city! Prices are fair. Unlike other people have mentioned, every time I have been here, I haven't had to wait that long. I would definitely recommend the grabong, pad thai, khao soi and gaeng masaman!"}
{"text":"Thank god we finally were able to get a table. This place is busy from morning till night (good for them). I really had a great time eating at Pai. They know how to make authentic Thai food and the make it feel as if you're back in Thailand. One thing I would recommend is make sure you book a table in advance (at least 2 weeks). Also, try the Pad Thai (I know baassicc) but it was delish!"}
{"text":"Khao San Road and Sukho Thai. Those were the two Thai restaurants I'm most familiar with in Downtown Toronto, and was extremely satisfied with both restaurants. I decided to try Pai, after reading reviews on Yelp and BlogTO on the fact this restaurant is on par with the two Thai restaurant kings mentioned above.

The signs outside this restaurant almost threw me off. When I saw the up arrows outside, I thought the restaurant was on the second floor! I was searching for a good 10 seconds for the stairs, but didn't manage to find any...then I saw the stairs heading down. Boy, I'm really confused now. I made sure the stairs heading down were the ones to the restaurant, and sure enough it was.

Service was slow pretty much from the point I entered the restaurant and throughout the whole time I was there. It took a good 3 minutes for me to be seated, and the restaurant wasn't exactly full when I was there. It also took a good 5 minutes for a server to come by and ask for what drink I wanted, to the point I ordered the food with the drink just to save some time.

The food came out at a decent pace though. I ordered the Chef Nuit pad thai mild, and it tasted excellent! I would say better than Khao San Road given price factor, but I still prefer Sukho Thai a bit more. The peanut ratio was actually perfect as well; I had some restaurants where they put way too much peanuts to the point it warps the taste of the pad thai itself.

I'll give it 4 stars because the food really was excellent, but if you're coming during peak hours expect to be seated at least an hour; the service here really is slow.

Free wifi! Ask for password."}
{"text":"Finally a really tasty and authentic thai restauraunt  in toronto. We stumbled upon this place about 1 month of being open and we've loved it since.  Last month we were in Thailand and we were craving the street food we had on our trip and so we headed down to Pai and even after having the real deal on the streets of Thailand this is pretty damn good and as authentic as it gets. The pad gra prao is delicious ! Great atmosphere, great service and food. Love Pai"}
{"text":"This place was a fantastic surprise. You aren't sure what to make of the place. It's kind of off the beaten path and it's in a basement as well. But when you get to the end of the stairs you are immediately put at ease seeing that the place is packed. The curry broth was rich and so delicious. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The menu is very inclusive, with clear indication of which meals can be made vegan (a green V found next to the menu item). Despite being initially impressed, I was left disappointed with my Khao Pad Thamada which is a stir fried jasmine rice dish.

After making sure with my waitress that the Khao Pad Thamada could be made vegan and that it would not be made with the usual egg and oyster sauce to accomodate my dietary preferences, I was very disappointed to discover egg in my meal. And lots of it. I'm assuming it contained oyster sauce as well since again, the meal is usually made with it. Since I cannot identify the taste of oyster sauce (having never tried it), I can only assume.

I gave Pai two stars instead of one because I would like to believe their effort in creating an inclusive menu would mean that this is not a typical occurence."}
{"text":"Another trendy Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto.

I came here for my friend's birthday dinner because I had heard that this place takes reservations and that the food was very similar to Khao San Road. The squash fritters were crispy, portions were good, and it tasted fresh. I ordered the Khao Soi and my friends ordered the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup. My order was great, but of course, like most Khao Soi's, it was very rich and creamy. Definitely too much for one person to eat in one sitting. I can normally eat quite a bit, but I still had to take half of it home with me.

The prices were reasonable, again, similar to Khao San Road. The atmosphere was casual and very loud. The service was good, but I noticed that it was quite slow.

This place gets very busy in the evening, and we came on a Saturday night at 6pm. The lineup was quite long by the time we left. Make sure you make reservations at least a few days in advance!"}
{"text":"Food here is always consistent and very tasty. Best Thai food outside of Thailand.

It can be very busy and on some evenings I've felt a bit rushed where they brought the bill before I was finished. I do understand that they want turnover since there is typically a long line. It's really appreciated that they accept reservations."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in Toronto. The location is a little hidden and sign is not that obvious. But the food is awesome. I've tried many items on the menu and never a disappointment. Curry, Khaoi soi, pad thai, pork belly. alll very good"}
{"text":"Pai hits the mark for me for authentic Thai food in the heart of Toronto. Located near the entertainment district, Pai is inside a basement and well renovated. A unique design and tight seating, it does give you a bit of a unique Asian feel.

We arrived on a Saturday evening with a long line ahead of us. We told the host we'd be happy to sit at the bar or sit with others (basically we'd sit anywhere). Originally indicated we had a 1.5 hour wait ahead of us, he managed to fit us in a smaller spot within 10 minutes! 

Food itself is meets my expectations. We particularly enjoyed the Khao Soi with the soup being flavourful and the noodles fresh. The Thai iced tea is also a must try if you're at Pai. Service will probably seem a bit rushed but that's because they always have a lineup!

Overall, I'd visit again and put Pai at the top of my list for Thai restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"This place is always super packed. Be prepared to wait before you get a table. Went in a few times because of the hype but it failed  to impress. Pretty average food for me but the wife seems to love it"}
{"text":"We tried to come here for dinner on a Sunday night without reservations. Hahaha we couldn't get in! So since my husband heard it has the best Thai food in town, he purposely drove downtown to get take out. Food was great, very flavourful. Please start delivery to the High Park area! We would be your best customers! Uber eats or something of the sort? Something to think about!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp as it was only 0.2 miles from my hotel and I was craving some Thai food. The pad thai is absolutely delicious as are the spring rolls. There was so much food and even after I was stuffed full, I probably could have eaten another bowl of pad thai."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever tried. 
The staff is friendly the food delicious. Beer is great too."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and the food is always delicious!  Doesn't really matter what you order, it's always flavourful, but definitely get the khao soi.  My only gripe is that there is always a wait.  I've been there for dinner at 5 and have had to wait 30 minutes.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, I guess, since it means people love this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely the most hipster Thai resto I've been to!

We shared amongst a party of three the green curry in a coconut, chef nuit pad thai, and the khao soi.  

Perhaps my taste in food is becoming increasingly less refined the more restaurants I try but the simplest pad thai dish was my favourite.  Tbh it didn't taste that much different than the ones you have at Thai franchise restos, but I quite liked it.  The cream to food ratio was also a bit heavy for the khao soi and curry - add more protein please, Pai.

Service was great, waiters were fun to talk to and the Winter Dog was a delicious drink.  Overall, the ambiance was superb and made my dining experience A+.  Bring your hipster frands here, they'd like it"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this restaurant. It is supposed to be the best thai place in Toronto and after ordering the pad thai with tofu and grabong I understood why. The food was delicious with decent portions and good service."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've ever had! My mom and I came here for dinner and got the papaya salad and green curry with fish. The papaya salad is served in a deconstructed way. The star of the show was definitely the green curry that was served in a coconut. You could also scrape off the coconut meat and eat it with the curry, it's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai places in Toronto! I've been here a number of times, and the food is consistently awesome. The pad gra prow and pad thai are my favourites... Yummy, so savoury. And the spice chart is actually accurate, so the most spicy level is really spicy (I have a high tolerance to spice). The place is quite large inside, with many tables throughout, bar, and tables where you can sit cross legged on the floor. Atmosphere is very modern and hip, so it attracts a lot of people in 20s and 30s, but there is a good variety of people who come. Honestly a top notch Thai restaurant with traditional flavours and a modern twist!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food ever. We had a sweet potato appetizer that was yummy and the split some fried rice and curry. All of us at the table were eating like there was no tomorrow. The food was so scrumptious. Flavor just right. Nice sized portions. Servers were prompt and friendly.  Divine."}
{"text":"The food is really delicious really authentic thai food, I had the nuit pad thai it was really good, and the pad graw pow with chicken. Also the Gaeng Kiaw Wan served in a coconut pretty creative idea. When you go there also order thai iced tea i believe they make it with condensed milk and it is really delicious i drank it before the meal was even served. Their price is a bit expensive that is the only criticism i will give this place but their food is one of the best thai places i have ever tried, it feels like i am in pai in thailand."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had.. Such an amazing environment to be in as well. The restaurant is very unique... staff is very bubbly and positive.  Would definitely go back! Very Pleased! Also, very friendly management and owner!"}
{"text":"PAI is one of my fave place for Khao Soi!! 

My friend and I came for girls-night dinner on a Thursday. We started with their PAI sangria and switched to merlot with our dinner. My friend ordered the pad Thai (foreigner spicy level) and I got the Khao soi.

The taste was 5 star, but the portions have decreased since I last came in. Their service is also good, but felt a little rushed after they saw us finish our meal. 

Will I go back? Yes, because of Khao soi"}
{"text":"We stopped here for drinks before dinner reservations elsewhere and now planning to return for that good-looking food!
Bar/cocktail menu attached and everything looked good but my absolute fave was The Serge Protector!!! It's a little mezcal, a little Germaine, egg white, pepper... great combination!
If you're a fru-fru drinker, go with Summer Dog.. I was lured in my the fresh lychee, which was great but it's a very sweet cocktail.
We also tried the sangria with the red wine floater which was excellent.
If you have a group, get the sangria glass pitcher; the presentation with the wine floater is beautiful.
Very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient bar service.  Hip vibe and feels like a place you want to hang out.  Such a good find in a neighborhood full of more commercial feeling/theatre district bars/restaurants."}
{"text":"It's another one of these thai places that serve khao soi, heard one of the chefs from khao san road opened this place which is literally like a couple a blocks away from it....pretty neat atmosphere, it's in the basement, loud and dark 

Prices are pretty similar like $14-$15 for the pad Thai and khao soi
Do not order the pork pad Thai unless you like ur meat to be overcooked and rough...I was being adventurous since I always order chicken or beef so I thought I try pork....other than the pork the noodles were good, similar to the other places....girlfriend ordered the beef brisket khao soi that was good, similar to other places but just that they place it in a clay pot bowl, good portions....beer is kind of pricy here so I tried to hold off, the spring rolls were nothing special, it's basically a veggie spring roll that you can get at any chinese place

Service was good Altho they kicked us out cuz we were there for 3hrs
They could have used some better chairs, found them to be quite uncomfortable, wouldn't mind coming back to enjoy the atmosphere and food"}
{"text":"A good Thai spot for communal dining. Spread your wings and soar beyond the typical pad Thai or green curry. Rewarding experience."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go for Thai food, definitely a Toronto 'hot spot' -even on a Wednesday it seems to be a steady flow of traffic. I do find all the foods very heavy but could've been our choices; squash fritters basically like sweet potato fries (hard to mess up but, I was expecting more of a Patti for some reason) spring rolls (just meh), I don't eat chicken wings but the rest of my party said they wouldn't order them again, pad thai with chicken was good, crispy Pork with a fried egg on rice (wouldn't order again) and the green coconut curry with beef was the saving grace had a bite too it and was presented beautifully. I'll be back but prefer it as a take out place when you just want to be lazy."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant several times for lunch but had never came for dinner until now. Just like always, Pai never fails. The restaurant is always fun, vibrant and cozy, with friendly staff and long line ups! Their Thai food always impresses and you leave satisfied! Prices are reasonable and justified with the delicious dishes you get. You almost forget you are in Toronto.

We ordered the Grabong to start as recommended by our server. It's buttercup squash fries, kind of like next level sweet potato fries with a Thai spin on the dipping sauce. Then I got the Pad Gra Prow with ground pork for my main and my friend got the Khao Soi. I knew I was going to enjoy the Pad Gra Pow because I've had it before but what surprised me was their Khao Soi. It was better than all the other Khao Soi I have had in Toronto. My friend actually liked the Pad Gra Pow better so we should have switched! Nonetheless you can't go wrong with these signature dishes. Their Thai Milk Tea is also bomb.

Go check this place out! You won't regret it! On"}
{"text":"Fantastic khao soi, (I usually get chicken or beef) and nua gra (garlic beef).  If you sit by the bar you can make friends with the mixologist who makes excellent cocktails."}
{"text":"We ordered the Khao Soi with braised beef - the presentation itself was really cool. The braised beef is really soft and tender and the curry is really flavorful. It's a bit spicy and they can make it spicier but not totally without a bit of kick.

We also ordered the Pad Thai which can be ordered as not spicy at all - also very flavorful and tasty.

Gaeng Kiaw Wan (green curry) was spicy but very good. If you're into spicy dishes then their curry dishes is for you. 

Grabong (battered squash) was crispy with a hint of sweetness to it and the sauce really complements well with it.

Their dishes are about $15 on average which is not cheap but also not too expensive.

We went as a group of 5 adults and 1 toddler. They do have a high chair to accommodate my niece. It was not really good for mingling as it's loud at the restaurant. You have to shout to get heard. 

Also, the service can be very slow. Not sure if it's because we are a bigger group though. 

They also have a really presentable washroom. A bit tight but clean. 

Overall, I was very satisfied with the dishes but the service could have been better."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and it delicious! It has just the right amount of flavouring! The sauce wasn't overpowering
and tasted good with the noodles. I also ordered the stringed squash appetizer that was very crispy and flavourful.  The service was very friendly even thought it was busy the times that I went! I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great vibes and even better food.

The food quality echoes the rival Thai resteraunt in Toronto (khao San road) but the atmosphere here is super cool.

A few steps under street level takes you to a awesome little hide away that begs you to spend a solid evening enjoying great food, listening to some great r and b and drinking singhra (Thai beer of course)

There's a reason this is one of the most loved resteraunts in Toronto and it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I visited Pai for dinner with a group of friends mid July.  It's now August 1st and I'm writing this review after 4 subsequent visits, once with a friend, once with a work group of 17 which I organized, and 2 other lunches.  The friends I brought mid July, returned the following day with their friends.  Yes, it's that good - just like all of the Regular's restaurants (they are no longer with Khao San Road).

I'm working my way through their menu and have loved everything I've tried so far: Pad gra prow, khao soi, papaya salad, fish green curry, (super tender) beef massaman curry and the spring rolls - I can't wait to try the rest. Also, the pandan sticky rice with mango - the best I've had since I had it in Indonesia cooked in bamboo over a fire in a remote village.  

While the service at lunch for a table of 4 can be a bit slow, the servers are friendly, knowledgeable and polite. I was very impressed with how quickly they were able to accommodate our large lunch group of 17 - we were able to sit in the private room, the food came quickly and all at the same time.  Everyone was very pleased and loved the food. Separate bills were requested in advance and provided without the fuss you sometimes get. 

For me the food at Pai beats that of Khao San Road, which isn't as good as it was in the beginning. I also appreciate not having line up forever just to experience other people's conversations or poor table manners at a shared table.

Now, what am I going to try next time I'm at Pai..."}
{"text":"I ordered the chef nuit pad thai with chicken and also the gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut for dinner; both were wonderful dishes.

Chef nuit paid thai chicken - both the chicken and noodles were cooked and flavoured really well - the only improvement I would make is that there was too much chicken compared to the noodles (which is a rare thing for a restaurant to have more meat to noodle ratio). It felt like it was almost a chicken dish instead of a pad thai dish. Nevertheless, it was a delicious dish.

Gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut - the dish was pretty cool in that it comes in a coconut. The curry was very creamy with flavours of coconut and basil; I highly recommend this dish. Again, the curry to rice ratio was a bit off (there was too much curry compared to rice). However, it's much better to have too much curry than too little.

Overall, the dishes were delicious, and I highly recommend them for your next visit!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to try some Thai food and it was pretty good. The design and layout of menu is very cute, artistic, and cartoonish - as if it was drawn and coloured with pencil crayon and marker lol. I normally order the Red Penang curry, but after looking at all the delicious menu items decided to try the Green Curry chicken instead, and it was pretty good. The Green Curry was authentic tasting and delicious. You can choose between mild and spicy. The Green Curry sauce is served in a small bowl with a separate bowl for rice. The Green Curry sauce was creamy and coconutty. I especially liked the decor as well because it had a nice Thailand feel to it. The back counter is decorated like a Thai street food market with blue/white tarps and hanging bananas. The service I would say is slower but definitely worth the wait. Definitely another great spot in Toronto for Thai food!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on the weekend - it was difficult to find parking around here, but it was certainly worth it. Thank goodness my friend was there first, because the place was very busy and got busier as we came in.

I had the spring rolls ($8.50) and Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($15.50). I liked the spring rolls the most, although they never seem to give you enough of them in number. The Pad Thai was also great - I wish I asked for a bit less sauce on mine, but that's moreso my own fault."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place near the TIFF Lightbox. For $13, you get a GENEROUS serving of braised beef in massaman curry sauce as well as enough rice to fill you right up. I also had the Moo Ping and it's probably the most succulent skewered pork that I have ever had in my entire life. The wait time for food is a bit long during peak hours but it was worth it! We dined at the bar and the bartender was also kind enough to give us a sample of the Thai Iced Tea when my friend pointed to it. Overall it was a great dining experience and it'll be tough to top this level of quality!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Toronto! No more no less.. we came on a packed weekend afternoon 20 minutes wait worth it! All of us were starving and we cleaned up everything on our plates.. Pad Thai and Pad Gra Prow were excellent .. I loved their fried fish with green curry.. as well.. good food = good life!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars! My husband and I LOVE this place - we eat here usually once a month. We've tried several things on the menu and haven't been really disappointed yet! My favourites are the green curry with chicken (so cute served in a coconut!) and the ox tail ginger curry. Other amazing eats here are the chef nuit pad thai and khao soi with braised beef (noodles in a golden curry sauce). We also like the fried fish (crispy basa fillets) and spring rolls here. Friends always get the braised beef in peanut tamarind sauce (gaeng masaman dish) and the thai iced tea, which are also good.

The pad gra prow (stir fried ground beef with an egg over rice) is also flavourful but doesn't seem worth the $13 price tag since it's so simple to make.

This place is crazy busy all the time but so easy to see why - the food is delicious and quality is amazing. Be prepared to wait an hour or more but it's so worth the wait! The staff are friendly and I love the casual underground atmosphere.

Bonus: they have drinks named after some of the Raptors!

The 0.5 star off is due to the wait to get seated and actually get food (though it's worth it), as well as the cramped seating with not so comfy chairs. If you don't mind these cons much, you'll love this place like we do!"}
{"text":"My frst time here and I wasn't disappointed...the line was long but quick and there is a devoted following given how busy and big the place has become. 

Everyone who worked there were cool as cucumbers and friendly. The section we were sat in is under construction  (not that we were in the middle of it) but because of that we weren't able to order drinks.  So we just had water (it was warm out, the water cool and I didn't mind)

I ordered the beef Salas and egg rolls and my friend ordered the pad thai. My salad was crunchy, spicy,  sweet, sour ...overall a Symphony in my mouth. The beef was lightly jeweled in the middle but had this delicious crust on the outside...it was majical and in didn't share (wouldn't and couldn't cause I wanted to be greedy).

The egg rolls were great the added black pepper in the filling made them dynamic and something that wasn't heavy going down.

To end the meal we shared a coconut sorbetto....it was more like ice cream and in the dish was uber,  peanuts, rice crisps, tapioca  and few other things I'm sure I'm missing. It was cold,  creamy and very strong and lovely flavour of coconut. 

All in all a great meal  and I'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Best thai food I've ever had in my life. Five stars to the food. The waiting time was long but totally worth it"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the ambiance, the lively aspect the interior everything about it was great and mostly the food was impeccable. I'd definitely come here again for a lively night but prefer for next be dinner and would love to sit at at the tables with pillows!"}
{"text":"A bustling joint situated in a central area downtown, this place is well-attended, often with lengthy waits during peak meal times. Came here with a friend on a Tuesday night at around 6, and the wait turned out to be 20 minutes or so. Inside the restaurant is loud, with tables arranged close to each other.

My friend ordered the khao soi and I got their pad thai. Their serving size was quite generous, and compared to the other places in the area was very good for its $15 a dish price tag. From what I tasted, PAI does a good job delivering deep flavours with rich spices, but personally I would have liked to see them add a bit more of a kick to it.

Only gripe about this place would probably be the noise level, as the low ceilings, loud music, and packed arrangement made it very difficult to speak over the crowd. If I were in the area and were craving southeast-asian cuisine, would probably come back."}
{"text":"Got Khao Soi as well as Pad Gra Prow this time around. Both dishes were good. Also got the Plum Mule drink which was pretty decent. The serving speed was reasonable given that it was pretty busy. They forgot to refill our water after being reminded several times though. 

The food is decent (minus the horrid Pad Thai, don't get it). Good vibes and ambience for both small and larger groups. Expect a wait if no reservations (20 to 30m for lunch), they text you when your table is ready. 

There's a food court style Pai Market towards the back with a more limited menu but no wait required."}
{"text":"This place was jammed for a Friday nite. Met some friends for a bite to eat. 

The appie was Tiger Shrimp, they were delicious but a little on the small side for a $13.00 order. My main was some on the best fried sea bass that I've ever had. Just the right amount of crumbs & the flavour was off the charts! Came with it's own garlic dipping sauce which just made it that much better. The only down side is I could tell that the side white rice had sat around for a while as it was a little \"crusty\" on top. I would go again if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Tho the food is good, the dinning room is too messy. Well for a person who likes things perfect it's a headache. Service is super casual, food is great."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but got my camera bag stolen right under my nose in this restaurant. The management refused to show us CCTV footages."}
{"text":"Been going a couple of times there and happy to give Pai a good review. 

First of; make sure to reserve or arrive early; the place gets packed pretty quick. 

The food is always delicious. My favorite dishes are the Khao Soi, the spring rolls ans skewers. The dishes usually come quite fast and well made. 

The staff are very friendly, polite and they know their menu well. They always take the time to present the dishes when they deliver them to you. 

They have a section where you sit on cushions, it brings a nice experience. 

The prices are really competitive for downtown core."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favourite Thai places

Cozy basement ambiance, although it can be quite loud especially when it is busy/crowded during lunch and weekends. 

Service was alright, could be better. They always seem like they're rushing you to get out just so they can accommodate other patrons waiting for the next table. 

My go-to dish is most definitely the khao soi with chicken. It NEVER DISAPPOINTS. The broth itself is very thick, creamy, heavy coconut flavour - hits the spot every time. The noodles is soft yet has a slight bite. Decent amount of chicken pieces. After eating the noodles, there is still quite a bit of broth leftover... don't put it to waste! Pro-tip: ask for a bowl of rice to soak up all that goodness."}
{"text":"So happy that Yelp led us to possibly the best Thai food in Toronto! There is definitely a \"vibe\" in this restaurant - the music was a little loud, the tables were very close together, and it seems to cater to younger people, but we had no problems with it. It was packed during lunch time, and I expect probably during dinner time as well, so plan accordingly.

The menus were colorful and descriptive -- my boyfriend has a deadly shellfish allergy, and they were able to accommodate his allergies by taking out oyster sauce and shrimp paste (with no detriment to the taste), so A++ for that. We ordered the chicken pad thai (YUM, BEST EVER!), and the braised beef Khao Soi. I've never had such good Khao Soi -- they said that they were sold out of chicken drumsticks, but I bet it's even better with the drummies. The prices are a little expensive for lunch, but it is SO WORTH IT. Would absolutely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great dinner before watching Book of Mormon.  Good ambience, fantastic food and friendly staff. Love thai food and this place offers the best flavors. Ordered Grabong, red curry chicken and crispy pork which are all exceptionally tasty."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST northern Thai food in the city.  Incredible flavours and the ambiance makes you feel like you're in Thailand"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and great service. Wait times for a table can get long during rush periods however the venue is large enough that theres not usually an excessive line."}
{"text":"Since 2012 when I was in Thailand, I regularly crave Thai food so Pai was definitely at the top of my list to try out. Very popular, we were unable to secure reservations two nights in a row so we buckled and ordered via UberEats. 

It was early and we wanted to try tapas somewhere else so we did a small order of larb moo (moo is pork for reference and as Chrissy teigan once said, it's weird and doesn't explain why chicken isn't baaaaaaahhhh and lamb oink, anyways...), som tum and pad Thai. Of the three items my favorite was the pad Thai, the larb moo and the least favorite the som tum. The pad Thai was so flavorful, delicious and absolutely reminded me of the street food we had in Thailand. The larb moo was spot on with its various herbs and spices and I loved that it was served with a side of sticky rice. For me, the som tum as just a little bit too fishy. My boyfriend who is Laotian loved it though so authenticity wise, it is very authentic but just too much for me. Next time I'm in town, I am definitely making reservations before-hand so I can try their other items but overall for what we ordered I found it decent. I wouldn't say it is my first choice to go back to but it was good - just not great."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. If you don't get into Byblos (across the street) this is good alternative!"}
{"text":"Did I order the wrong thing? I got the braised beef Khao Soi and I found it pretty horrendous. The noodles were over-done, the broth was extremely salty and the beef looked and tasted more like boiled tasteless meat used in soups. Got a case of wicked dry mouth after!

My dining companion really enjoys this place and clearly a lot of other people do too... but based on my visit, I really don't get the hype over the food. 

In terms of service, it was very slow and standoffish... I'll come back and try some other items on the menu, but my first visit was definatley underwhelming. Would not be my first choice for Thai food."}
{"text":"Easily a 5 star if the service was as incredible as the food. Curry served in a coconut with chicken was everything you'd expect and want from a Thai restaurant. Had medium heat with that which was just right for those that like some spice, but still enjoy their dish without sweating. Another dish that is an absolute must is the staff's favourite pick. With crispy pork or beef, this dish is the reason why I will be returning and waiting to eat at Pai again. Besides slow service, servers were nice and the bartenders were great as well. The atmosphere is great inside, call and reserve a table a week in advance or get there on the earlier side of dinner time."}
{"text":"Really fun and quirky atmosphere with some really great northern Thai food. You have to try the squash fritters! So tasty and great spot to have a chill night with friends."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I work nearby and so I frequently get takeout for lunch. My favourites: Pad Thai (not the usual ketchupy crap but something on a completely other level); the massaman curry (hearty, rich, full-bodied in its flavours); the green curry (luxuriant). The dishes don't pound you with heat -- they're flavourful and nuanced. 
My only issue is that the price point is a little high -- $13.50 for the Pad Thai.  That said, it's very, very good and so I don't mind spending the $$ to have an excellent dish. I just don't do it as often as I might otherwise!"}
{"text":"Pai has one of the best and most delicious pad Thai I've ever had. SOOOO GOOD!! I got the chef Nuit paid Thai with chicken, and it was absolutely delicious with medium level spice (I believe there are 5 levels to choose from). The kick of spice, tang in the tamarind sauce, and portion size were all perfect. It's a bit pricer ($15.50 not incl tax) than other pad Thai dishes around the area, but the quality and taste definitely make up for it! 

 It was very busy when we got here (around 8pm) but thankfully there were still seats at the bar. Staff were very friendly and asked us about how we were finding our food, and the food came out quite quickly as well. I love Pai! Definitely want to try out the other dishes next time I come here, which will hopefully be soon! Highly recommend!! The hype is worth it :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Basil Chicken dish & my colleague had the Chicken Phad Thai...both actually horrible!  What???  I have been waiting to try this place for ages.  Go to Salad King instead, a million times better & cheaper & bigger portions & you do not have to wait forever for your food!  Worst place ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in 3 days. Soooo good. 

Very chill ambience with good bar seating. Chill beats set us in the mood as we sunk into our chairs with silly grins on our faces :-D

My wife and I started off with fresh coconut water during both our visits - fresh and flavorful both times! We then proceeded to try the Green Papaya salad (excellent, although the shrimp crackers could have been fresher I think). We then ordered the Garlic Shrimp with Thai chilli sauce (lightly breaded, succulent shrimps, a big hit with us), Pad Thai (well made and full of flavor), Gai Satay (succulent chicken and excellent peanut sauce), Tom Yum soup (heavier on the tomato side than i've been used to in Thailand .... but a huge hit again! It worked very well! A must try.) This was followed by Green Curry in a coconut ....... wow. Just wow. All my 5 senses were involved with this one. Definitely a must try. 

One of the best Thai places we've tried outside of Thailand. I give it 4 stars because I feel they can improve the quality of their shrimp crackers and offer more dishes on their menu. Other than that, loved the place and will definitely be back with more friends and family!"}
{"text":"Went in a group of 4 and ordered as much as we could. Everything was top notch, but the spring rolls were next level. If it wasn't for the ridiculous wait times I would probably eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. Just love the way the restaurant is set up. Very unique and it feels homey. Service was great, even though they were busy at that time. Food was awesome. Prepared as authentic as it is. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere at Pai is awesome! The beef in the green curry is so tender and delicious and the sauce is so yummy that it was so hard to stop eating. Also, it comes served in a coconut! 

The pad Thai is one of my favorites! The sauce is the perfect balance of sweet, savory and spicy. The cabbage on the side gives it a nice consistency and is a welcome change from the regularly added bean sprouts. 

Make sure you read the spice level guide on the menu before ordering.  The spicy is very, very, very spicy!!"}
{"text":"Save some time, make reservation online!  Very traditional Thai food restaurant with cool interior design!  The fried rice was delicious!  Pick crispy pork!!! And it matches with their green curry!"}
{"text":"Pai hosts a nice warm, vibrant atmosphere. Would highly recommend making a reservation or at least going an hour in advance to book your spot. As mentioned in other posts place gets busy, I went on a Wednesday evening place was packed. 

Cause of time I was offered to have my dinner at the sitting level. You sit on the ground on the upper level stage. Accompanied by carpet on the ground and pillows. It was cool and unique but didn't last long. Over time it gets a bit uncomfortable. But my biggest annoyance is that everyone can see you. I don't eat like a pig or anything but just a low key type of guy lol. 

In terms of the menu, all your favourite Thai options are here. Fried shrimp ( ordered a second round ), fried rice, pad Thai, green curry, red curry, etc... The quality and the portions are great, especially for the price. Vibrant colors and flavors. The Curry's were not too thick and not too watery. Best part these guys know spice. When they say hot its hot. If your not a avid spicey eater would suggest starting off mild or normal.

Overall great place, would highly recommend if your going with friends, casual, date, etc etc. Great service. Just remember to book in advance. And try to avoid the sitting area, unless you do yoga on a regular. Even if you end up there the food makes up for everything."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto, as I'm sure you'll come to see from the usual lineup out the door! 

Everything on their menu that I've tried has been great but I highly recommend the beef noodle soup! Better than most of the food I actually had in Thailand!

The atmosphere is definitely pretty vibrant and loud as the place is usually packed but the prices are very fair and the dishes are definitely worth."}
{"text":"I found this place a bit too hipsterish in terms of the atmosphere but the food was good.  I got the beef curry with rice, Thai iced tea and spring rolls. No complaints and pretty good place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome cocktails, SUPER fast service and delicious food. Win!

Really enjoyed all the food and drinks we ordered!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the atmosphere was lively.  I had the braised beef in curry and it was seriously spicey and very tasty. The Tom Yum soup was fantastic. Prices are reasonable too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great service, the food was nice. I had the pad Thai with chicken. It was a bit too sweet for my taste, but I asked for extra peanuts and it helped."}
{"text":"The massaman curry with the braised beef. I still dream about it. If I ever go to Toronto again, this is definitely going to be a stop.

My friends and I came here on a rainy saturday night. The place was packed and we had to wait about an hour, but we did it because the yelp reviews were so great. And it was totally worth it. This is hands down the best Thai food I have ever had!

Also, they have pictures that tell the story of the couple who own the restaurant. It's so cute, check it out if you're waiting for your table."}
{"text":"Omg...you have to try this place! Thank god for yelp, without it we wouldn't have went to this place. The food is the most authentic thai food I've had this far. The service was great, very friendly staff and the place was packed already at 5pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"So delicious! Atmosphere is great and staff is very professional. The food is fantastic and menu options are great. Very good at accommodating allergies."}
{"text":"There's a great vibe, lots of space and I've always been impressed by the food. Would recommend this to anyone looking for great Thai (-and not just pad thai)!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. I really liked the way they serve their dishes - so unique and interesting. I ordered a curry here and it was pretty good (but not the best). I took one star off because the green curry could be more flavourful and it was way too runny. I prefer thicker sauces with more veggies inside. However their Oad Thai was really good. The other reason why I probably won't come back so soon is the crowds - it is very loud here. It is not a place to go on a date (you won't hear each other unless you almost yell), or want to spend a quiet, relaxing time."}
{"text":"The food here is yummy and the atmosphere brings one out of Toronto's hustle and bustle and into the ambiance of beautiful Thailand.

The service was mediocre. They had a rather bland lemongrass iced tea, which sounds really delicious on the menu, yet it was extremely disappointing when it arrived and ended up tasting like lemongrass syrup water! WAY TOO SWEET! 

The take out 'side of sticky rice' was a morsel if that. TRIPLE PACKAGED: plastic zip bag (completely unnecessary) + styrofoam + paper bag = Pai restuarant being no friend to the environment and a complete turn off for ever going back! 

I believe my 4/10 star rating is even generous!"}
{"text":"Had to wait a little for our table but was worth the wait. I was there with a pregnant friend, seeing which they moved very fast and made room for us! 

The have 5 levels of spiciness! We ordered family style so that we got to eat everything. Tried pad thai, green chicken curry, fried fish with curry, spring rolls, beef curry, and mango with sticky rice, some fried vegetable (i forget the name). Especially loved the way they served curry in a green coconut! Also their mango juice is made from real mangoes. Everything was nothing but yummy.  

I personally like places that place whole bottle of water on your table. This one does. 

They have their one year anniversary this weekend, wish I was there for that. If you are in Toronto, please go for the anniversary celebration. they are giving free massages and what not!"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal, so you better get here EARLY or you'll be waiting for a long time. It gets loud in here, so be prepared to speak louder than usual/shout. The fab cocoktail menu definitely earns a whole star on its own - yummy!

I'm not a big fan of the seating; it's rickety and rustic, but I guess that's half of the \"authentic\" appeal of this place. And the plus side is that the hard seats probably make it easier to turn tables quickly and bring more customers in for more $$$. Bathrooms are tiny but clean."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and great atmosphere inside. Heads up that this place gets very busy. Head out early or be prepared to wait in line. The wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Thai cravings? PAI it is. 

I love the mood & food. The place is usually packed, at least from my experience , so call in ahead for reservations.

I can't remember the menu I had off the top of my head but ask the servers for recommendation(s); you won't regret your visit here."}
{"text":"Always busy but they move through tables really quickly! Be ready to stand in line. Pretty much everything on the menu is terrific."}
{"text":"Delicious with deep uncompromised tastes
I like the curry and the soups, but everything is good. It seems like their philosophy is authenticity and not compromising for Canadian palettes.
The décor is nice and looks interesting. They have put an effort into it.
the restaurant is busy and packed, but they have not become inattentive with service. They could smile more, but do have the smarts to still be polite and communicative. In fact, the owner came around to thank us for coming when he had 100 other customers.
Also, prices are reasonable.
I hope they don't drop standards like every other business...
Favourite: khao soi
Glad that: their pad thai doesn't come with Ketchup like those other so-called Thai places"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to. It's busy - make a reservation in advance or prepare to wait a bit. Service is amazing. AMAZING Food. Great Vibe, good prices (although alcohol is expensive). We've tried and LOVED the Green Curry, Pad Thai, Squash Fritters, Coconut Shrimp, Tom Yum soup (get the dinner size with rice - WOW), satay. You can't go wrong. Perfect menu. Perfect place."}
{"text":"Tasty?  Yes.

Smaller portions, overhyped, & a few dollars more expensive than a ma&pa place?  Also yes.

Above the decent food, this place survives on buzz and atmosphere.  Subterranean digs is sorta a cross between an island bar/resto.  It is loud, dark, & jammed with knick knacks.

Wait for 2 ppl, on a Wednesday evening, was an hour.  You give the hostess your cell, they give you a pretty accurate estimate, & you'll get a text msg letting you know that your table is ready.  You can respond NO if you've decided to eat elsewhere.  Despite the wait, they've imposed a pretty convenient system, so that was good.

Food took approx. 20mins to arrive (I timed it!), but you sorta don't realise it because it is soo loud.

I ordered the Masaman Beef Curry ($15, I guess they raised the prices as per online menu) and it came in a medium sized soup bowl.  There was maybe 4-5 chunks of brisket, but the rest was a curry soup.  Tasty, but it would've been more fairly priced at $12-13.  Pad Thai tasty good too, but ~$15 and portion was on the adequate, but on the smaller side.  Unlike other Thai places that I've been too, YOU WILL NOT BE TAKING HOME LEFTOVERS if you just order 1 main per person!

There seemed to be a gap after 8pm where, if you're lucky, you can walk in and get a table for a small party.  Otherwise, you'll be waitlisted.

Worth the wait?  If you're up for an experience and never tasted decent Thai food, yes.  Otherwise, you'll survive skipping this one."}
{"text":"Came here in a group of 10 and none of them left unsatisfied. This is my first Thai restaurant and Im hooked! I ordered Grabong (squash fritters? Good for 6 people) for $11 and Braised Beef Curry (curry fan here!) for $15. Both were very delicious! I wish I had made my curry spicy tho since they have that option, so make sure you do that! Im giving it a 5 because food, place and service was enjoyable (\"Vin Diesel of Pai\")."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!!! The food amazing!!! The attention fantastic. Even the side rice was unbelievable!!! I want to move here just to go often there."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Monday and easily got a table. I know some reviewers mentioned you either need patience or a reservation, but that is probably only true for dinner.

The interior is reminiscent of a Thai street. The lighting is a bit dim and the speakers were blaring, and I kept having to remind myself it was monday at noon and not midnight on a Friday night. This might not be the best choice if you want to whisper sweet nothings into your special person's ear.

Luckily the food was good enough that I didn't mind foregoing in depth conversations as I shoveled food into my mouth. We ordered the pad thai and Panang beef. I've had enough mediocre pad Thai in my life that I wasn't expecting much, but this pad thai had the depth and layers of aroma that most lack. The beef was also quite good, but not sure it was better than other restaurant's.

All in all a good experience, but not sure it quite lives up to the 5 star hoopla that surrounds it. That said, there is nothing quite like some Thai spice to warm you up in the dead of winter."}
{"text":"i cant believe ive never written a review about pai. this place is magnificent, the taste is incredible and the flavours are SO bold. if you're looking for bold and authentic thai food, pai is the place to be.

i have eaten nearly everything on the menu because i go so often. whenever i crave something, its usaully pai. I recommend ordering:
1. Squash Fritters for apps (its better than french fries, seriously. they use these amazing herbs i think)
2. Khao Soi - absolute BEST DISH IN THE WORLD. 
or
2. Green Curry in a coconut - you can scratch the inside of the coconut to eat the actual stuff
3. Mango Sticky Rice (beware, not always in season so they may not have it)
4. Thai Iced tea (which is a must)

seriously, everything on the menu is wonderful

i think this restaurant is even better than khao san because the chef decided to go away from it and make her own store (chef nuit), but i'm not positive about this fact. someone confirm!"}
{"text":"*4.5/5. 

*The noise level can get quite loud sometimes with the music and surrounding conversations, but it was never to the point I had to yell across the table.

*Service is CONSISTENTLY bad. The servers always seemed a little forgetful at times when we'd ask them to refill water or extra bowls. They were quite fast when we asked for the bill though. 

-Tom Yum Nam Sai Kung Mor Fai - $15
The soup arrived with a tiny fire at the bottom to keep the broth warm. The soup was fantastic and had a perfect blend of sweet, savoury and spicy. However for $15, there were only 5-6 tiger shrimps and chopped pieces of mushroom, thus I would say this dish wasn't necessary worth the $15 price tag and it would have been nice if fish was included as well.

-Gaeng Kiaw Wan (Green Curry) - $16
The green curry arrived at the table in a young coconut shell and you can scrape off the coconut \"meat\" from the inside. The curry itself was packed full of fragrant and aromatic flavors, and had the perfect consistency and richness. The chicken pieces were tender and soaked up all the curry flavors. Though it was quite spicy, there was just enough sweetness from the coconut milk to counteract the heat.

*Quick tip: Pay attention when you order any dishes that are being served in a coconut or pineapple shell (like fried rice). If the restaurant is cheap, they will reuse the shells!! However if there are still some \"meat\" or fruit in the shell. most likely they are freshly used :).

-Sai Ua Platter/Northern Thai Sausage - $14
I found the sticky rice to be on the dry side but the pork belly sausages were perfectly cooked. The greatest part of the dish had to be the relish that contained yster sauce and shrimp paste, with some intense flavors, binding all the components together.

-Squash Fritters: 
The fritters were piled high and it was not as sweet as sweet potato fries, yet still had the \"fries\" texture. They were light and crispy on the outside, and fluffy and sweet within, paired up with a nice tangy bright tamarind dip. 

-Mango sticky rice: 
Occasionally they would run out of mango and serve with a Thai custard instead, and I dislike it as the custard made the entire dish way too sweet. The mango that they use is a bit more tangy which complemented perfectly with the sweet sticky rice, however it would have been nice if they used incorporated black sticky rice for textures."}
{"text":"Friday night.. Waited 45 minutes to get into the restaurant.. And another 30 minutes to get a seat. My patience, on the verge of breaking, was soothed on the first spoonful of the most mindblowing Thai curry I've had in my life! However, if you come from South Asia/South East Asia and you think you can handle the \"Thai Spice\" level option on their menu, think again and just go for the \"Farang (foreigner) spice\" level.. Excellent food and brilliant service amidst all that chaos!"}
{"text":"This is the second most reviewed place in Toronto....had to try right?

Came here on Saturday night before Easter, table for 1 (sad face) around 9pm.  I still had to wait about 40 minutes because it WAS pretty busy,  i didnt even mind the bar!

Service took a bit long but i guess its typical for a saturday night.

All i wanted was pad thai and that was what i ordered!  Intrigued by the level of spice offered,  I asked the server how spicy was the phet mek mek (the spiciest of it all, THAI SPICY is what it was referred) and she said it is like 10 out of 10, like it is really spicy.  I said ok i'll have that with my pad thai.  She asked if i was sure and had a look of concern....ok iim a little worried but they always make it seem really bad, i said im sure.  She said they won't remake it if its too spicy (i guess its my own fault if anything...) i said thats fine... (i started to panicked after she left and texted my friend for moral support)

My plate arrived and it looked pretty...dangerously pretty.  I took my first bite...and...IT BURNNNNNNNNNN....combined with the temperature, it was definitely spicy...i almost teared...but it was DELICIOUSLY BURNING SPICY!!  anyone who loves spicy...enjoys halal guys red sauce...this is the same love feeling!!  

The pad thai is sweet and tangy like pad thai normally is.  The spice mixes well with all the ingredients and the chilies just adds fuel to the delicious fire.  I had this dish with chicken and the chicken was moist and coated with the tamari sauce.  I ate it all up quickly (also so that i could avoid the build up burn!)  

The prices here are decent, maybe just a bit more than most places but converted to USD, its pretty reasonable!  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai, very good flavours. Fresh taste from all the ingredients, especially the chives. The Pad Thai is spicier than what the scale suggests, order anything above medium with caution. Overall very good food."}
{"text":"Lives up to hype. 

Food so good. Lovely to an enjoyable level. 

Recommend for all. 

Easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere, and awesome vibes. Don't get the Thai Bucket drink, it's gross, but everything else was awesome! Go team!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their green curry is awesome. So is the noodle dish with beef. They also have really yummy cocktails. I have been for dinner and lunch. This place is always busy so be sure to come early if you don't want to wait too long."}
{"text":"A friend and I walked in asking if there are any TVs in this place. The bartender abruptly said there's a place with TV next door! Who the hell tells customers to visit some other place when you already have customers at the restaurant? Horrible customer service. We ordered the pork skewers and fried rice. Both were disgusting. Avoid this place! Go to khao san road instead."}
{"text":"At the encouragement of one of our group members, my 5 friends and I decided to hold our exchange reunion at Pai, as opposed to another popular Thai restaurant (hint: it starts with a K and ends in Road; y'all know who I'm talking about). 

The wait was a reasonable hour for a party of 6 that arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday evening (reservations were booked at least one week out) because they allow you to put your name down and go your merry way until your table is ready. 

The ambiance is hip and reminds you of the hostel you wish you stayed at in Thailand. The server was friendly and helpful with the recommendations. 

I got the beef Pad Gra Prow (mild because I'm a baby). It consists of spiced ground beef over rice and topped with a fried egg. The spice level was just right--spicier than I expected for mild, which is great because it pushed me and when combined with the taste of holy basil reminded me that I was eating Thai food and shouldn't be such a baby. The yolk was perfectly runny and when punctured provides the fat and flavor needed to mellow out and complement the ground beef while dialing up the flavor of the jasmine rice. The only mistake was a user error: I thought it was a great idea to pour all my chili infused fish sauce over my dish halfway and was left with something that was too soggy and too spicy to enjoy. I guess if you like a wetter, spicier rice dish, go for it, but I was pretty sad that like Freddie Prinze, Jr. in 90's classic She's All That when the nerdy girl discovered that she was a bet and gets mad at him, I ruined a very good thing.

Ok now for the real reason I'm even writing this review: the Thai Iced Tea. So I'm kind of a Thai Iced Tea (or cha yen if you're being pretentious) conosseiur; I mean it was 50% of the reason I visited Thailand...ok 60%. This one is nice because it's served over a glass full of crushed ice. The tea is also stronger than your usual Thai Iced Tea, which is great because then the overall drink is not overpowered by the sweetness of the condensed milk. 

TLDR: Make reservations at least 2 weeks in advanced. If you absolutely cannot stand spice, ask for no spice. Get the Thai Iced Tea if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"its good food service was quick and they care about customer reasonable price and taste good & strong defiantly"}
{"text":"Food is good but a little bit pricy for the food. Super busy even at Tuesday night. Go before 5:30 and u will have chance to get a seat."}
{"text":"The spring rolls are to die for!"}
{"text":"We got here around 5:30 on a Friday and there was a lineup to get a table but we ended up getting seated after 15 minutes. The atmosphere inside was very inviting and and busy. Since there were so many people and pretty loud it was hard to speak over the crowd. We started off with the spring rolls followed by the shrimp pad Thai, Khao Pad Thamada with chicken (rice, egg and chicken) and Khao Pla Tawt (Basa fillet in red sauce). Everything tasted fresh and not something that was a day old. The flavours were rich and delicious. Enjoyed all the dishes. I would definitely come back to try other menu items. As we were leaving there were still lineups to get in! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat in Toronto.  

We found this place on a whim, because we were looking for a place close to where we were, and luckily found parking.  It didnt really look like much from the outside when we passed it but still decided to venture in.  We were really surprised.  It was a small flight of stairs down and we were seated rather quickly since it was still early.  We apparently beat the dinner crowd because by the time we left it was mobbed with a line waiting to get inside.

The menu was quite extensive and we tried a lot of things between the 5 of us.  The food was really good, and varied from traditonal dishes like pad thai and curry to more exotic.  Everything we ordered I would order again.

The service was good too, especially as it got busier, we didnt have any issues with refills or ordering additinal items.

Overall this was a great find and I would definitely go back if I was in the area.  You should give it a try if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Pai is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto! It's not a luxury fine dining place, they have their own unique \"Thai\" environment that I love. You won't be able to find anywhere like this in Toronto.
I've been here more than 10 times and I usually get their green curry (in the coconut)!! It's truly amazing and delicious, and if that doesn't fill you up, you can carve out the coconut flesh and munch on that as well. 
I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing vibes. There is always a long wait but the food is always worth it. You have to get squash fritters, the mango juice (secret!), and the pad grow prao (rice dish with pork). Also ordered the soup noodles once and that was also amazing. Great place for a date or just chill vibes with friends."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Thai places. I love the vibe of it! It's like walking into another world. Super colourful and lively! 
The pad Thai there is my favourite. I've tried them all. I can't pick a favourite. They do great curries as well and their drinks are to die for. You feel like you're on vacation here. 
Great to get take too though to bring home. 
I have a wonderful experience every time I go. 
Fun to go with friends or on a date. Might be too loud to go with older parents."}
{"text":"10/10 I would visit again

Got the recommendation from a local and so glad we visited! 
Super cool decor and very friendly staff. 
My date ordered a Thai iced tea and loved it! I enjoyed the sangria, it's homemade and delicious. 
I had the chicken pad Thai and would recommend it.

{"text":"- Definitely in the Top 3 restaurants at this price point
- While waiting for your food I highly recommend enjoying their specialty sangria. 
- The decor and ambience one of the many factors contributing to the overall feel of the place. 
- Must order : Khao soi with shrimp, Pad Gra Prow with Beef, papaya salad, 
- The chef personally came by to ask how everything was. Great touch that puts the restaurant in elite territory"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The service is good and the atmosphere is inviting. 

I had the braised beef peanut curry and green papaya salad. I still think Thai Country Kitchen on Spadina has the best green papaya salad and sticky rice but they are in different categories. 

I can't wait to go back and try other things!"}
{"text":"Food was good, the restaurant is cute as hell, but very overrated making it crowded all the time, so not really a go-to place for me."}
{"text":"This is one of those gems that I like to keep in my back pocket that I keep on talking about.

They've got a solid Pad Thai and their spring rolls were well worth it. I can't wait to use them for a corporate event. Service was great and efficient. if you can get a seat on the patio, I'd say DO IT! It's a little cramped but a great place to hang out.

Well priced too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Khao soi is an absolute must, under no circumstances should you substitute the egg noodles for rice noodles (read: literally nobody cares about your fake gluten allergy)"}
{"text":"Came here to try it out since everyone was telling me I needed to come try! 

I ordered 3 items with a friend and a Thai Ice Tea. 

Moo Ping - I was not that excited for this to be honest as pork tends to be dry at a lot of places. Oh my god it was so yummy though! Very juicy and full of flavour! I never knew pork skewers could be so tender. 5/5 

Gai Satay - after having the moo ping, I thought the chicken skewer had to be amazing. I was very disappointed however as they were very dry and chewy. The sauce was okay but the chicken really ruined the whole thing. 2/5

Chicken Pad Thai - The Pad Thai was amazing! It was not too dry not too saucy and very flavourful. It is still missing something...not quite sure what. 4/5

Service - waiters were great! The place was very busy but waiters were pleasant nonetheless which is great! The water canters are also so cute! They make cute tweet sounds :) 

All on all, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A small dimly-lit restaurant well-nestled inside the hotel; In need of some updating especially juxtaposed to the newly furnished lobby. Service was very prompt and courteous. I ordered dinner which was quite palatable. The dishes were exquisite in their palatable detail. A taste of plain old macroni with shrimp (although I had ordered spaghetti-a faux pas!) revealed a melee of several variants of cheese in addition to ground nuts."}
{"text":"Had the spring rolls, green chicken curry and pad Thai, all fantastic with a cold beer and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Only experienced Take Out, so I can't comment on the service. However, the food was GREAT. We tried the spring rolls for an appetizer, Chicken Pad Thai, Khao Soi with Chicken, and the Gaeng Masaman with Beef. 

The spring rolls were spring rolls but the curries were AMAZING! I probably went into sensory overload having the Khao Soi. I just wish there were more noodles, I wanted to drink this stuff. 

I think everything was reasonably priced and packed well for take out."}
{"text":"Delicious, have not been disappointed. Food is always on point and probably the best Thai food in the city!"}
{"text":"Been going here since it first opened.   The owner is the original owner of Khao Saan road.  It's authentic, fresh and has great service.  I also go to suko Thai there other location."}
{"text":"For the most part authentic Thai food in Toronto has been served in places decorated with elephants and Buddha statues but Pai has introduced the concept of serving this popular fare in a Duncan street rabbit hole designed for basement dwelling hipsters. It is small, crowded and hectic. The service was efficient but a little scattered and inconsistent at times. They do take bookenda reservations, however, so planning ahead ultimately avoids a lot of headaches.  The food lives up to the hype by offering authentic recognizable dishes such as pad thai, tom yum soup and spring rolls as well as other favourites such as green curry and Thai sausage.  The rolls (with the kicking dipping sauce), soup and noodles deserve honorable mention but the curry, in particular, was among one of the best I have had.  Maybe it was the cute coconut as a vessel but the consummate flavours and tender beef made it the premier dish of the evening.   The accompanying sauces such as the Thai relish served with the sausage were delicious.  The Thai caesar platter, although an interesting and exciting concept, was disappointing mainly due to the lackluster Caeser mix and boring shrimp sauce.  I loved the option of farang (foreigner) spicy which added a great bite while respecting the other flavours such as kaffir lime leaf and lemongrass.  Price wise, it's definitely more expensive than Salad King or most hole in the walls but very much in line with other hipster destinations offering noise and chaos as menu options.

I would have liked to give it 3.14159265359 out of 5 but it deserves at least a 4."}
{"text":"This place is a mix of North America meets Thailand. There is a lovely market indoors featuring Thai ingredients such as rose apples. Very busy place though and I don't blame them because their cuisine is delicious. Their Thai fried rice was so delicious featuring jasmine rice on a banana leaf which was accompanied with white chicken and all the Felipe's aromatic spices only know to Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town. Masaman is unbelievable. The oxtail is surreal. If you can handle the wait, it will be a delightful experience. This is a no brainer. Go for it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. I had the green curry and khao soi. The curry had a perfect blend of spice and flavor. The environment was great and cultural. I would highly recommend you have a reservation because it is very crowded. Many walk ins had to wait. It's a not terribly priced but each dish is around 16-17 dollars."}
{"text":"Good food, and I'm not even big on Thai. I had the Pad Gra Prow with shrimp. At first glance, the dish looked like it might have been bland, but it was anything but! Lots of flavour, portion size was just enough to fill me up, and there were plenty of shrimp. The Thai Milkshake, which is made with condensed milk (have you ever tried eating this stuff right out the can?), is also a must-try!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian so my review doesn't apply to everyone. The food tasted alright but I've had better vegetarian at Khao San and at Sukho Tai. However, it did taste better the next day.

Ambiance and service were great though!"}
{"text":"So glad i took a chance this time without réservation lunch time saturday . Everytime i try making dinner reservation when visiting Toronto they're booked up and suggest three weeks later. Think not northern thai cuisine is so good when well executed the freshness of the prawns green papaya salad. Pad thai ; red curry . Must try that place when in TO.wish it was here in Mtl. We are lacking good thai rest."}
{"text":"Total cheap eat hipster restaurant. The food was ok but nothing special. The staff were great but the decor really needs some work."}
{"text":"My people!! The waitress was so nice and the food was extremely authentic and delicious!! Would def go back!! Sticky rice and mango was legit! Differentiating \"Farang spicy\" and \"Thai spicy\"  was def clever and hilarious to me. Their cocktails were amazing as well! Love the place very much!"}
{"text":"If it was possible to eat here everyday, I probably would. This place is my favourite Thai restaurant on Toronto. My favourite dish is their Chef Nuit's Pad Thai. Once you've had pad Thai here, you won't want to eat it anywhere else. It is must try!

Other good items on the menu are their green curry, khao soi, Chang Mai beef noodle, tom yum!! All extremely well made dishes :) this place never disappoints! 

If you don't have a reservation, make sure to show up early (around 5pm) for dinner or else you'll be waiting a long time!! This place gets busy! And they have no slow days."}
{"text":"I hope they keep they rename the amir johnson gin drink! So minty.. so fresh.. so good!

Night market is amazing at the end of the month so make sure you go.  Go early though as it gets BUSY.  

Pros
They text you if it's super busy. Leave your # and they'll tell your when your table is ready.
Good thai food - I got the coconut thing

Cons:
My coconut was way smaller than other peoples. (Seriously it seems like the food is based on coconut size!) -.5
Gets super busy"}
{"text":"Good is always amazing and authentic here. Service is also good but it is Always busy so be prepared to wait in line. Prob the best Thai food I've had in Toronto. Prices are a little on the higher side. Great ambience."}
{"text":"great thai food, but what made it was the atmosphere all together. The meat (both chicken and pork) were good, but the chicken was more fresh. I enjoyed the pad thai but my friend said there was too much oyster sauce. Beer was a good price! May be back again if craving thai food, if not then it won't be a place i'll bring friends for a random dinner."}
{"text":"This place is BIG but it's also PACKED so be prepared. We came here for a friends dinner party. If you have a group of more than 8 people, I strongly recommend making res otherwise you're going to be waiting foooorever. 

The service and servers in general are quite nice but kind of slow. You can't come here, hope to be seated quick, eat and leave. This is a camp out. Literally. 

I got the Tum Yum flavoured soup with shrimps. It's was okayyy. There were a lot of tomatoes. Like 11 and I'm not a fan of tomatoes. However, the portion size was quite big. I didn't finish it because it was shareable. And it comes with this flame thing to keep it warm which was nice. 

My friends tried a whole bunch of other stuff that they really liked. And everything is practically under $20 for large portions which is nice. 

The atmosphere is also nice although it can get loud real quick. Also, there are stairs that lead down so if you have kids in strollers be ready to carry.  

Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The interior is pretty hipster with a cool layout and the environment is a perfect date spot if you want Thai. It's a comfortable feel and a cool vibe throughout :). I always order the same thing when I go out to Thai restaurants, which unfortunately, I will only be able to review for: 
1. The first dish is the green curry with chicken (medium spice level but can be adjusted for each person). I've had this for both, lunch and dinner, and it has simply been my favourite dish at this restaurant. The curry has bamboo in it during dinner, however was missing during one of my lunch dates. I am not sure if they include it during lunch as it might be only available at dinner times - an amazing addition to the dish (asking for it is highly recommended). Regardless, it is absolutely delicious and a must have. 
2. The second dish is the Pad Thai. A definite choice to have if you're on a date or with a group of people as it is a heavy dish and therefore, sharing is recommended. I've eaten many pad thais, some of which are much more expensive, and this is still my favourite one. 
All in all, love this place."}

Food: 4.5/5
-I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and it was delicious. It has the right amount of sweetness and the veggies/nuts added a lot of texture and crunch to the dish. I wish there was more chicken though! 
-My friend ordered their golden curry - tried a bit of some and it was delicious. She enjoyed it very much as well :) 

Service: 5/5
The waiter was very quick to take our order. One thing I liked was that he always came by to ask how we were doing and consistently filled up our water glasses without us asking. 

Environment: 3.5/5
The place itself is quite crowded - especially during the lunch rush. I recommend going right when it opens to avoid the wait. Also, it's quite dark (located underground), and so there was barely any natural lighting.

Will go again :)"}
{"text":"Came by for lunch the other day and the experience left much to be desired despite being Thai Select... 

Was able to be seated upon arrival upon opening and ordered the Thai tea which was a tad too sweet...not quite like Thailand...

Moved on to the Khao Soi with braised beef and it was ok. The braised beef was dry and overcooked....bummer

The crispy pork belly was embarrassing as i think it was refried from yesterday and was super dry...

Staff was ok. Portions were generous.

$30/head after gratuity and tax for lunch..."}
{"text":"Terrible Thai food. Too salty and lack of flavours. Not to mention it is over priced. Not even close to real Thai food.    Even Salad King offers better Thai food. Long wait for table. Don't go there."}
{"text":"Had initially wanted to go to a different Thai place on Queen W called Nana (near T-B Park) and when we learned it was closed on Mondays we were devastated. Still craving Thai I yelped the nearest Thai spot and this gem popped up. I first fell in love with this restaurant when I looked at their oddly patterned step upon opening the door. The place, albeit darker than most as well as louder, had this inviting ambience that I believe comes from the flags hanging from the ceiling and assorted chairs. 1pm on a hot Monday and we were quickly seated. 

To those who enjoy caffeine, Pai's Thai Ice Tea is a MUST HAVE. Caffeinated drinks typically dry out my mouth but this kept me so refreshed, especially with the food if you like it spicy. 

We started out with the spring rolls which were piping hot. Pretty good! Rolls were STUFFED with filling and they didn't break as we bit into them. 

Friends ordered wings and Chef Nuit's chicken pad thai. Both good except the pad Thai I found to be hotter than expected. I had the medium heat chicken Pad Gra Prow and it was heaven. Medium spice gave it a nice warmth that didn't overpower the dish and the egg on top just brought everything together. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  

The food was oh so good.  Good amount of choice without feeling too overwhelmed.  One type of pad Thai one type of curry.  Both so amazing.  I did not order the food but everything I ate was good.  They had 5 different spice levels and we got mild as ordered family style so had to suit everyone's taste.  Just ask for the chilli oil on the side if you want to turn up.  

The place was packed at 7pm Thursday night, understandable but they had no waiting area at all.  There were about 25 people jammed packed at the front and the stairs.  Made it awkward to say the least.  

Overall I'm very happy to try this place.  Will be back.  Only problem is deciding here or ksr"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want to have a more open Northern Thai experience, everyone here is very friendly and speaks English fluently which helps to avoid any mixed up orders. The place has high tables, bar-stool seating for the most part and is normally packed with the owners memorabilia from his time in Thailand, plus some eclectic disco, Jamaican and Caribbean decor. The music was great, playing classic, funk, disco, rnb and though it didnt fit with a Thai themed restaurant it was fun.

Since we were on a tight schedule we decided to have mainly starters and drinks before our show. Between the grabong, shrimp cocktails and soups we were quite pleased with the result. fresh ingredients, home made dipping sauces, and fresh ingredients really kicked off our night. The drink menu and pricing is way off in some cases, and reflects the local area more than it does actual value. Not to mention that half of the good drinks we wanted were unavailable. Good food, good experience with pricing a bit high at points."}
{"text":"The Grabong (deep fried squash fritters), pad thai, gaeng kiaw wan and gaeng masaman with braised beef is an absolute must! If you can handle the mango sticky rice at the end, make sure you get it, or save your belly until next time. I recommend stretchy pants, a loose sweater and a good walk after this meal to help digest all the noodles, rice and deliciousness! A cool and relaxing atmosphere to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great vibe and great service. More than value for money. For its price point, this deserves a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Location wise, i don't get it - but if it's some indication that the entertainment district is going to transform into a place adults will actually want to go to on a weekend, then i'm all for it. 

Pai offers good thai food (not great), great trendy atmosphere, excellent presentation, exceptional service and high value. It's finds itself in that happy balance between whole-in-the-wall-but-amazing and amazing-but-really-expensive. You can easily go here with a large group, or a small group, but i feel it's more of a friendly restaurant than a date night restaurant.  

At the end of the day, it's a good experience because of the ambience, presentation and space, but food wise, it's not a total homerun. 

Tip: They have amples of space, and a great private room with a very good prefixe for the group. Good consideration for a birthday celebration i would think."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was good, but not cult classic good as I was led to believe. Visit solo and sit at the bar. The wait is shorter. Lots of hype here and lines to prove to it. Atmosphere was super lively on a weekday night. Lots of cool decor around to discover. Reasonable cost for meal. I'd come back again no doubt to try out some of their other specialties."}
{"text":"Book a reservation. This place is very crowded and popular. It's a trendy place with good food. If you don't mind bumping elbows with other people or sharing tables, this is a good place for fusion Thai food. 

I went with my friend for a summer dinner. It took us a few weeks to get a reservation. They are good in that they are punctual with their seating even when the place was full. The service was fast and friendly. The food was interesting and appropriately spicy. 

The place was recommended by my friend. It didn't disappoint. I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't feel very comfortable. There wasn't a lot of space. The table next to us was so close that they could examine what my friend ordered. The restaurant was very loud, so it's not a place to have long conversations."}
{"text":"I went in Oct 2014 for an early dinner with a girl friend around 5:15 pm on a Saturday night. She had been raving about this place & this was my first time going. 

We were seated immediately and given a choice between an area tucked away or the main room. We chose the main room. 

We started with their specialty/signature cocktails which were pricey ($11-14) but delicious. 

I deviated from my friends suggestion for my main. I was in an adventurous mood and I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with extra crispy pork on top of the ground pork on a bed of rice with a Thai style egg cooked on top ($16$. I went for Fareng Spicy which had a little bit of a kick but didn't require I drink a lot of water to cool my tongue. Overall, the dish was average. I wouldn't order it again. The portion size was really good however and I was pleasantly full after eating all of it. 

We also ordered the starter of fried squash fritters called Gabong ($10) which my friend also recommended. They were good although I was expecting something different. I also can only handle a little bit of fried food so my friend took the leftovers home to her husband. The tamarind dipping sauce was disappointing and boring. 

The waitress wasn't very friendly even though the dinner rush hadn't started yet. She didn't give us much time to look at the menu to order drinks. 

The ambience was chill and cool. I liked the dim lighting. 

I plan to go back for dinner tonight and stick with something safe like pad Thai which I hear they do well :) it's a good location and I'm hoping the service will be fast again as I'm seeing a play at The Royal Alexandra Theatre @ 730 pm."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance!  We have been to numerous Thai restaurants and so far this is the best for us!  We came early because we know there is always a wait but we were seated within 15 minutes - the line outside is deceiving.  It is worth waiting even if it took longer than 15 minutes because their food is delicious!

The Pad Thai is my favourite.  Khai Soi seems to be my daughter's favourite because of its creamy taste.  We were scared to go 'Hot' on the spice level of our food because we are not too sure if we can handle it.  Instead we went for Medium.  I personally would like to go Hot next time as the kick of spice in my opinion adds more flavour.  Everything is good.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place in town for eating in! Pai has a great vibe with very fast and efficient service. As a Caesar lover I definitely recommend Tom Yum Caesar as it's the perfect combination of flavours! Their non-alcoholic drinks are not as good though. Tom Yum soup itself has a great presentation but the taste is different from original Tom Yum we are al used to. My date who ordered it didn't like it while I truly enjoyed the uniqueness of the flavours. My favourite dish is Khao Soi. It has a lot of sweet curry coconut sauce and crispy noodles on top. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I visited a few times in the last few weeks and Pai has never failed my expectation! Its truly an authentic Thai food experience and the right price and portion. Best of all they take reservation:). 

My last visit was with my whole family, and I consider them to be tough critics since they don't like to try new things. I was worried what they will say about My choice of resturant. Thankfully they LOVED every dish that came their way, and I was spared. My new favorite dish is the pork strew, it literally melt in your mouth with a explosion of flavor!

I will definitely be coming back here....just hope the line up won't become like Khao San Road and have to wait 2 hours for a table...but I guess its inevitable.

BTW, its better than Khao San Road IMO. And that's says a lot !"}
{"text":"Dinner at Pai was a good experience with good food. I'd recommend going here for dinner with a friend who likes to socialize.

The food was very good, especially for the price. I had a Thai tea, the squash fritters, and the Khao Soi. All were good. The fritters was an enormous portion but not too filling, good for sharing with the table. The curry was tasty but a bit boring. 

The service was good. We sat at the bar, and were impressed by how much attention the bartender paid. He even took the time to join our conversation (and we welcomed him) on a busy Saturday night. I was also very impressed by how quickly the food came out. 

The restaurant is a little dark, and feels divey. Somewhat Asian, informal decorations crowd the walls. It was packed on a Saturday night. Thankfully, we didn't wait at all once we talked to the host, because the place seats so many people. 


Overall, we enjoyed Pai. I'd recommend going here for dinner with a friend who likes to socialize."}
{"text":"Always enjoy food here. It's my to-go place whenever I have visitors out of town.

Go early - otherwise good dishes get sold out - been trying to order the chicken wings but it's too popular."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I have taken many of my friends here for their 1st time and/or recommended this place and they absolutely love it (I'll be coming here again very soon...now for the review)

Rating: 4.5/5

I ended up coming here for my birthday (woo for getting older/wiser/closer to retirement?) during lunch with a few friends. Let me warn you now, GET THERE EARLY. In my experience (been there over 5 times) for dinner, get there before 6:00pm if you are walking in and for lunch, before 12:00pm.

Ordered:
1) Garlic Shrimp - 6 deep fried breaded black tiger garlic shrimp served with a sweet and spicy Thai chilli sauce.
- this was delicious, couldn't started off with a better appetizer 
- if you have a large group of say, 4 people, I highly recommend getting the Grabong for dinner, which is freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters
2) Chef Nuit Pad Thai w/chicken
- in my opinion, this is the best Pad Thai I have ever had in Toronto (I had great Pad Thai in Thailand before). Decent-sized portion with lots of flavour, by far, my absolute favourite in the city! 
- another favourite of mine is the Gaeng Masaman with braised beef - tender beef - you will absolutely love itttt!!!

Review:
I can't say enough about this place because I never leave disappointed (I have high expectations and I'm hard to please when it comes to food). If you are looking for some good Pad Thai and/or a place that won't hurt your wallet, come here! Reasonable prices, great food/service!

Helpful tips:
- No Reservations: if walking in, come before 12:00pm for lunch, 6:00pm for dinner (this place is pretty popular and I have seen long lines for dinner during the peak hours from 6:30-8:00pm 
- Recommendations: Order Pad Thai, Masaman with braised beef, Garlic Shrimp, Squash Fritters, they even have REALLY GOOD SANGRIA!
- Seating: lots of tables for 2's/4's. May be a bit tight in the middle since all the tables are close together where it is easy to overhear a conversation from your neighbours. They just opened up some additional space in the back, so they can take more people in. If you have a large party of say 16, they do have a private room hidden behind the bar.
- Environment: good place for a reunion, date, place is hipster"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  I came here for the first time last year and the food was amazing.  Since then the quality of the food has gone down.  They even raised their prices probably to deal with the minimum wage increase.  However, now it's an overpriced restaurant with very mediocre food.  They no longer put care into their food and instead mass produce them in bulk to accommodate a large crowd.  I guess it's time to search for a new Thai restaurant because I won't come back."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday after work. The place was very loud and the average crowd was young , less than 30. We ordered popular dishes like green curry, pad Thai , spring rolls and Miang Kung. The pat Thai was really good but everything else was just ok. Starter portion was very small. Miang Kung was interesting in terms of presentation and flavour but that's all. With two beer and a Thai iced tea, our bill was over 80 dollars before tax and tips. I don't really like the deco either which is like a street market setting. There was a Thai rice packaging hanging on the wall outside the washrooms as decoration. If you don't read Thai or Chinese, it might feel exotic or interesting, but not to me. In a nut shell, this place is loud, food is okay. Cheap deco but not with cheap food."}
{"text":"The food is really good, especially the curries. The green curry is a must try (Penang curry), the cocktails are very good but the best thing about this place is the decor and ambiance and atmosphere. The reason why I am giving it one star, when it should really get a 5 star is the personal experience I had. I told our server 2,3 times that I am extremely allergic to shrimp, that it'll kill me if there is shrimp in my food, and asked her to note it down. When she brought my \"checked curry\" it was filled with actual shrimp. But since the coconut shell was filled with the coconut milk and the broth, I couldn't see the shrimps and it was possible that I eat the broth and be dead by now!!! Luckily, before I start my food, I asked my friend to try some of my curry and then he realized there is shrimp in my food, just when I was about to eat it!!!! Now I would have been dead because the server made a mistake but the worst part was the restaurant management! Not only it took them 30 min to bring me another chicken curry , but also they even charged me for it!!! Everyone on our table finished their food and were waiting for me meal to arrive! I think I made a mistake by not making it a big deal... I felt bad for the server so I kept saying, it's ok, it's ok don't worry, thank God I'm still alive and .... but the least management should have done is to serve that food complementary, like any other food establishment would have done this .... the min they should have done.
Pai was my fav place and I used to go there at least 2,3 times a month but after this behavior not only I am not going , but my friends also decided not to go there again. I think it was so inconsiderate of the management (who came to my table to ask about my allergy after the incident), but ultimately went and charged me for the whole thing... the super late food, the drink and ....
So disappointing .... some practices are just industry's norms.... maybe an experienced manager would have know that they should have not charged me or had to offer something as an apology...."}
{"text":"Best green curry in town! $16 for dinner, served in a coconut. Friendly servers and a good vibe all round!"}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of Thai food so when my friend booker this place for my Bday I was like \"Ehhhh, let's give it a try!\" We went there around 6pm on Saturday and it was already packed. The place was so different with all Thai place I had been too. When the food came, I was like Wow!!! Everything was so delicious! The portion was enough to fill up. The sauce was so creamy and rich. All staffs were so nice and friendly. I talked to a guy at the bar and found out that they actually bought a lot of spice and ingredients from Thailand, which costs them more but it's completely worth it. 

I would definitely highly recommend this place to everybody."}
{"text":"My go-to Thai place in the city. Pai offers the best balance of everything you'd hope for in a good Thai restaurant. The atmosphere is lively, the décor is nice, the food is excellent and the service is consistent. Beef Khao Soi, spring rolls, garlic shrimp, signature pad thai and oxtail are definite must-tries. The worst part is waiting in line."}
{"text":"I actually wanted to not like this place because of how much hype it gets. But the food is truly delicious and worth the wait. Recommend the padthai and curries"}
{"text":"It was our first visit. The place was crazy busy, lineups straight out the door! Reservations cannot be made over the phone, you have to go in person and wait to be seated and/or put your name down on a waitlist to be contacted. We waited an hour to be called over. In the meantime, went across the street and sat in a coffee shop.

The food was good although I was quite disappointed with only 5 pieces of shrimp in a dish that cost $18. Hmm. Really? Understandable that seafood is pricey but don't be stingy and charge extra and not provide sufficient amounts! Something to consider.. I was deprived of adequate protein.

We also ordered an appy that never came. Our main dishes arrived with no appetizer in sight. Flagged down a server to cancel that order.

If I ever go back, I'll try the khao soi.

Giving the resturant 4* because service was decent given the fact that staff were running around trying to attend to diners and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Pai is my go-to thai place! The atmosphere here is very vibrant, they play great music and the staff are always so friendly. It does get pretty crowded, so I'd recommend making a reservation. I usually order the chicken pad thai, khao sai with beef with a side of rice and maybe 3 or 4 glasses of their thai iced tea! (haha clearly a MUST)"}
{"text":"Massaman beef or lamb curry, green chicken curry, thai basil spicey noodles - all great. Careful with the chilis, this is the real deal. Do not order \"Thai spicey\" unless you know what you're doing - i.e. you have lived, truely lived (not traveled or 'backpacked') in Thailand outside of Bangkok."}
{"text":"Thankfully I got there right after 5pm because the line was out the door. I walked down the stairs into a warm, dim space that was lively and busy! Just 1, I asked because I am alone traveling. I got seated at the bar where I was promptly served and always noticed.  Their famous Pad Thai was amazing but pricy. 1 dish $16.35. The service and environment made up for the overpriced noodle dish. I will be back to try a couple more items."}
{"text":"The music was loud, Had a hard time hearing my girlfriend.
Normally I hate environments like this, surprisingly I had a good time under the circumstances.

Expensive, but great presentation.
It's worth it for a nice outing.
I like booths to sit at for privacy, the seating here was super close and tables small, again not my taste, but again had a good time.
The food tasted really good, very good.
Service was great, I highly recommend this place for a nice outing, price is high 80 for me and girlfriend to eat and drink and desert after tip.

More of a younger upbeat crowd.

Ohh and I loved the music they played, I think that's why I didn't mind the loud music, it was my kind of music, I was bobbing around for a few songs.

Do try this place, Great thai food, great service."}
{"text":"Love love love their pad thai. Very saucy and flavourful. Best pad thai I had in Toronto. Also ordered green curry and fried rice. Fried rice had a slight sticky texture but it did not stick to my teeth which I liked. Green curry also above my expectation."}
{"text":"Their pad thai is good but the portion is a bit small."}
{"text":"We had to wait a bit but the food was excellent. The atmosphere was a little noisy but all in all a great place to grab some good food."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my boyfriend after paint night, as it was close by and the reviews are awesome. Got here at about 8 and there was a lineup of people and a length waitlist. I was really craving Thai food, so we agreed to wait and see what the fuss was all about.

We got seated at the bar, after about an hour-long wait. We decided to get some drinks - their specialty sangria and a Thai beer. The sangria was sooooo good! I would have ordered more, but I already had wine earlier and didn't feel like tumbling up/down the stairs on the way out. I ended up getting the Thai iced tea at the end though...couldn't resist. 

The menu isn't very extensive, so it didn't take really long to pick our items. We ordered their spring rolls to start, the green chicken curry aka Gaeng kiaw wan (served in a coconut!) and the Khao soi. The spring rolls came out pretty quickly and we gobbled them down really quickly, as we were starving! They were delicious and so was the sauce that came with them. 

It took quite a bit of time for our mains to come out though. The place was packed though.. We were hoping our waiter/bartender would have come to see us after taking our orders, but he didn't make it back until after we were done eating our meals. That is the main reason why I'm downgrading this review to 4 stars. The bartenders that were making drinks all night in front of us were amazing. They were not only taking people's orders at the bar, but were pretty much putting on a show for us at the bar. It wasn't anything spectacular like fire, but I was really fascinated by their work.

Sorry, back to the food.. I've never eaten green curry, but was pleasantly surprised. I got it at the foreigner spicy level and had no regrets. It was the perfect amount of spice for me, although my boyfriend found it quite hot. There was a lot of chicken, so I got full pretty quickly. I tried the Khao soi and thought the sauce was delicious. I also really liked those crispy noodles that they give! We finished it with the Thai iced tea and everything was just great. 

Overall, the food was pretty good. I wish they had panang curry on their menu (my usual order in Thai restaurants), as I'm sure it would've been incredible. But, I'm glad I tried green curry, because it was delicious. Boyfriend found the Khao soi to be good, but no wow factor. Drinks were awesome. The bartending crew was amazing - super fun to watch and extremely kind. Our waiter was a bit M.I.A unfortunately.. Overall, not sure if I would come all the back here from Thornhill/North York, but it's definitely a great place for everyone to try."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. Vibes are amazing and food is great. Nicely priced and the drink menu is extensive and full of variety."}
{"text":"imho, when comparing upper-end thai restaurants in toronto, the differences are more like quibbles than enormous chasms. it's not bad vs. good, just very good vs. great. imho, pai is the better than ksr. it's not light-years ahead, but it's better nonetheless. the food is tastier and it's less pretentious. 

the chicken wings are incredible. the soups and curries are almost perfect. perhaps they could be a touch hotter (temperature, not spiciness). 

the cost is reasonable.

the décor doesn't exactly scream thai, but i don't care. the food blinds me to everything around me.

unfortunately, the service has suffered in the last few months."}
{"text":"Food: 6/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service:2/10

Food was good but nothing special. Ambiance is great! Service was slow and pretty much non existent. Over 30 minutes for food after we've order is unacceptable. Chicken pad Thai was better than most places but the noodles were over cooked. The laap salad wasn't flavorful enough. The Chang Mai beef noodle soup was good but not enough to make me want to come back. If I were to ever go back it would be just for the atmosphere and drinks."}
{"text":"Update:
Friday 7pm. BUSY! There was a line to get in line to wait to be seated. Unreal. They have the main dinning room, the 3 side dinning areas. The wait really wasn't that bad! 
We were seated at 8pm and for our food by 830. 
We ordered the coconut and Tom yum soup. Almost every table ordered it too. Can't go wrong! Plenty of fish and shrimp for the value!"}
{"text":"AMAZING thai food in a trendy bar basement setting!!! And great sangria too.......just be prepared to wait unless you have reservations. It's always jam packed...........another good sign for sure."}
{"text":"Thai is one of my favourite cuisine and Pai has become one of my favourite restaurants as well. I have been here for dinner and have ordered lunch from them a couple of times. 

I love their curry dishes the most. I ordered chicken and beef before and have been very happy with my choices.  I also tried their pad thai and although it was good, I cannot say that it was out of the ordinary from other places so I would go back to their curry choices.  

My only complaints is the service, be it at the restaurant or delivery. Although they are friendly, service is quite slow. One time they missed a dish when my office ordered from them.  Their lunch menu  is also much more limited than their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Pai is a busy energetic Thai place in the entertainment district. Very casual but the food is delicious and service is fast and cheerful. Reservations are a good idea. There is a good selection of beer and wine as well as non alcoholic drinks. Nice spot for tasty food and energetic clientele. Prices are very reasonable considering location and popularity. Fun place for a group to go for a good time."}
{"text":"Heavenly food, ambiance, music, cool vibe, and sweetest staff are a few things to expect at this hip & super cool joint...
We had two appetizers garlic shrimp, and Grabong (fried squash)--khan soi shrimp, and green coconut curry for mains and coconut sorbet for dessert!! Everything was finger licking good!!! Yelpers got it right!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but I hate the wait. Textures, flavours, atmosphere, everything else is awesome. If you're looking for a place with atmosphere and good food, then this is a nice spot (unless you don't want to wait). Don't forget to share a Thai bucket :)"}
{"text":"Too long; didn't read: excellent Thai food in a cool downtown Toronto spot. Plan ahead for long lines!

Atmosphere: basement restaurant on Duncan Street decorated reminisce of a beach bar in Thailand (dark woods, bright colours and dim lighting). 

Staff and Service: we were seated quickly and felt well attended-to prior to seating - there's an expansive bar area where people frequently wait for their tables. However, I'll say that the table service was pretty terrible (sorry!). Our waitress came and went, never checked in on us, and never offered us water. 

Food and Drink: amazing food and great prices. We started with the Spring Rolls ($8), and shared the 'Chef Nuit Pad Thai' ($15.50) and 'Gaeng Kiaw Wan' of green curry with shrimp ($18). Dishes are easily shared or enough for one - most of the curry dishes are served in a hollowed our coconut (although ours was not...). Either way, I can't see going wrong wit any menu item. Of note, the Paid Thai was unique - rather than a sweet tamarind sauce, it was flavoured with a peanut sauce base. 

Overall impression: what the restaurant lacks in their service, they make up for with their food - would highly recommend Pai!"}
{"text":"oh this place is really great, being the sister of Khao San road. I would come here before going there and here's why: 
+ much bigger, instead of the 2-3 communal tables at KSR, there's individual tables and even a waiting area so you don't have to line up outside!
+ very nice, cozy decor 
+ menu is just as good if not better (more choices)
+ great, I'd not better service 
+ YOU DONT HAVE TO SIT ELBOW TO ELBOW OR BE STUCK WITH FACING STRANGERS! 

There's probably more ++'s."}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews I had to try this place. I can without a doubt say this is the best Thai I have ever had! Big statement considering I have even lived in Thailand for a few months. Also best service I have came across at a Thai restaurant (not something thai places are known for) I came here my second last night in Toronto and came back again my last night both nights at peak dinner time the line moves fast and is worth every second of wait."}
{"text":"Good vibe, good food. 
Disappointed that green curry didnt come in a coconut in lunch time though! :("}
{"text":"Booked reservations in April for dinner in May - a huge testament to how busy they are. From the moment we came in, the environment was great and the decor was very different. We got right into it and ordered an appetizer while I ordered a bed of rice with prawns and a fried egg and my friend ordered green curry with rice. I also asked for my dish to have the absolute spiciest flavouring they offered. My mistake as I was extremely overconfident with my ability to handle spice, and thought I'd be fine. They did ask me if I could handle spice and MAN did they deliver! I was sweating bullets and my tongue definitely lost some taste buds but it was amazing and they definitely came through as promised. We also got the Thai iced coffee which was amazing - definitely try that if you need to get a drink that'll cool down your senses. Will 100% go again and recommend it to anyone to try even once!"}
{"text":"The review is based on eating in and take-out.

My first experience at Pai was when I had a take out of their Khao Soi with beef. Had to line up to pay for the food which is disappointing as you just have to watch your food get cold. When I opened the plastic container at home, I found extremely firm, wavy (very short wave length). It was simply very uncooked. The fried noodle was softer than the egg noodle once soaked in curry. The curry itself was creamy and nice but it would obviously would never stick to the hard noodle. I was extremely disappointed after reading such good reviews. So do not get takeout for noodles. Do not risk it.

However, when my friends came from the states, I decided to give this place another try. Ordered green curry and khao soi with beef. Green curry in coconut was really amazing. It was smooth and had such great depth of flavor rather than just being sweet as is from many thai restaurants. Khao soi turned out to be a completely different dish with the cooked noodle. The thick creamy oily curry was perfect for the egg noodles. It was really good with my leftover rice from green curry as well. Sangria was sangria. 

So always eat in if you want noodles. Otherwise, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm surprised I haven't discovered this Thai restaurant earlier...! My best friend said it's her favourite Thai restaurant in downtown so I decided to give it a try. We made a reservation for 9pm on a Saturday and they seated us a few mins after 9. There was a huge line up waiting for a table so I recommend making a reservation beforehand. 

I ordered the green curry and mango sticky rice for dessert. A few mins later, we got our mango sticky rice.... Not sure why they brought us our dessert before the main course but oh well I was hungry so I didn't mind. The mango sticky rice is literally a piece of mango on top of some sticky rice. It tasted good but not worth the price of $8.

My green curry came in a coconut shell. The coconut was too small to hold all of the curry, so they put the extras in a separate bowl. It was flavourful and had a lot of chicken and veg. After I finished the curry, I scraped off some of the coconut meat to try. It was really good! 

Service is great. The waitress we had was awesome and attentive. Came to check up on us frequently just to see if everything was ok.

I would totally come back for some more curry!"}
{"text":"WE GOT SICK. This was our first time at Pai and was extremely excited because of the amazing reviews we saw on yelp. During our meal, my food was delicious. I ordered the popular Khao Soi with drumsticks. However my friend had their green curry (vegan) and said that it was flavourless and was very disappointed. After about half an hour, both my friend and I started getting very nauseous, thirsty, and dizzy. Overall, we were disappointed. I took time to think about whether or not I wanted to write this negative review because their curries were flavourful and tasty (at least for my dish). However, I would not want someone to also feel sick after eating here. Be careful!!"}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday night and it was super busy. We waited half an hour outside. I thought the place was small but apparently, they have a lot more room in the back. The place is dimly lit with chairs that don't make one another. I felt like it was a bit random and kind of hipster-ish.

The girls said this place was very good. One ordered the tom yum soup while the other ordered the khao soi. Both their dishes were very flavourful. The soup was a combination of sweet, salty, sour and spicy. It was extremely flavourful. The beef in the khao soi was tender and delicious.

Prior to those dishes, we ordered the butternut squash appetizer. I loved it. Great flavour since it's battered with red curry. Tasted great even without the dipping sauce.

As my main, I ordered the beef salad with farang spiciness level. It was quite spicy but delicious. The steak was cooked to perfection, slightly charred on the outside and red/pink on the inside.

Will come back eventually even though I rarely come downtown."}
{"text":"Food and service were both amazing. Had the authentic taste of northern Thai food and definitely lived up to the hype. Would have personally liked a little more heat in my food, I give it 4 stars because most of the food tends to stay on the savoury sweet side. A little more invigorating spice would have satisfied my pallete a bit more."}
{"text":"I finally got around to checking this place out. Pai is super popular, so it gets very busy during dinner time. I'd highly recommend you make a reservation - otherwise you'll be waiting easily over half an hour for a table.

The restaurant is huge on the inside and runs like a well-oiled machine. Everything from getting a table to getting your food to getting the bill is designed to handle a LOT of customers. The atmosphere inside is very loud and boisterous - not quite bar levels of rowdy, but certainly not a good place for finding some peace and quiet.

Food-wise, they have quite a few good-looking Thai dishes. I tried the moo ping (pork skewers) and the gaeng kiaw wan (green coconut curry) with fish. They were both delicious. Portion sizes are a bit on the smaller side (aka they're normal-sized, rather than oversized like most restaurants). There's also a nice selection of interesting cocktails and drinks, though I didn't try any.

Overall the experience was fun, and the food was tasty. I wasn't a huge fan of just how big and loud the restaurant was - at times it felt like the restaurant was just herding cattle. But if you don't mind the crowds and the noise, then check this place out sometime."}
{"text":"Great tasting thai food in the heart of the entertainment district downtown Toronto

It can get very packed in here and long lineups are a frequent sighting, which speaks volumes on how great the food tastes here

Prices are very reasonable and you can get a good meal for under $20.

For my latest visit, I ordered the gaeng hunglay ox tail stew which comes with jasmine ice. My friend had the khao pad thamada stir fried rice with chicken. Both of them tasted great and we found that the ox tail stew with the thamada rice made a really kick ass combination. Tasty!!!

We got in around 6pm on a Sunday and it was decently packed, but luckily there were tables at the back for us. By the time we left around 7:15, the lineup was out the door lol. 

Get here early and you shouldn't have to wait too long for a table"}
{"text":"Awesome and authentic Thai restaurant with a dope hipster vibe.

Came here with 2 coworkers around 8 pm on a weeknight and had to wait about 30 minutes, but worth it! It's actually pretty spacious if they take you to the back room area.

Grabong is the perfect appetizer to share! It's a bundle of fried squash fritters with a delicious dipping sauce.

I got the braised beef khao soi dish as my entree. The noodles were perfect and it was nice to have braised beef in a Thai dish, which isn't the norm."}
{"text":"First time here and the thai food is quite delicious and authentic! I had the beef noodle soup with the brisket. It was the perfect broth with fresh herbs. My sister had the green curry served in a coconut. We as a group had the fritters, beef salad and papaya salad as apps. The papaya salad was my favourite with the sauce to content mix. The atmosphere is rustic and warm. It's on the lower level of a building. When we went around 5 we just missed the dinner rush. Just an hr in, the restaurant is full and vibrant. The wait staff were super nice and helpful with the menu questions. Another bonus is there was a phone charging station for your phone."}
{"text":"Had take out and it was soooo good! Though if you are eating with kids who are messy beware that the food will stain clothes!"}
{"text":"Pretty hipster Thai restaurant in Toronto, reminds me of some of the places found in LA. The restaurant is dimly lit, but definitely noisy, and looks to be always crowded as my friends and I stopped by on a Wednesday night. 

We all decided to share a couple of plates; beef salad, khao soi with chicken, pad thai with beef, and pad gra prow with crispy pork. All in all, they were all pretty delicious, the beef salad was cooked medium rare, and was very tender. The Khao Soi had that nice coconut taste, noodles were pretty al dente and the broth itself was rich and thick. The pad gra prow is definitely a must with crispy pork! Pad Thai will taste exactly like it should."}
{"text":"Love this place, one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto so far. Their mango sticky rice (dessert) is probably the best I've had in Toronto and GTA. But the line-up is almost impossible to avoid .. Also not great if you're trying to catch up with a friend because it is quite loud."}
{"text":"Good food, but definitely of the hipster variety-- this place definitely doesn't feel nor does it taste (what I imagine to be) authentic.  

Ordered the pad thai noodles per their spicy scale... believe I got *local* spicy which is supposed to be the hottest level they have.  Not really that spicy, and tasted a bit different than other pad thai I've had before. More savory, less sweet.

The pork skewers were good, tastes wood fired almost.  The fried rice was good too, though nothing to write home about.

Service is a bit on the slow side, but friendly none the less."}
{"text":"Delicious - fresh and flavourful. 
I love the food at Pai and the space is also fantastic. 
Do make a reservation unless you are prepared for a long wait (though it is worth it)
Soups are amazing - especially on a cold night ."}
{"text":"Pizza is  excellent  here  particularly  the desserts they have  among   the best  desserts I ever  tried . My  sis  and I have some dessert sure that I  cannot   discover  it other  locations  so the only  reason that  I come here is because of the desert  try  them and you will like it"}
{"text":"It's going to be a long wait and you'll probably get the curry which is similar to a bowl of water with coconut milk in it heated in a microwave. You'll probably ignore this review so have fun at Pai. But just remember, I told you so!"}
{"text":"I have come to the realization that I know very little about Thai cuisine. Only recently did I begin to read about Thai cuisine and about how dishes are 'supposed\" to taste like. For example, pad Thai is not supposed to be pink! And it is not supposed to taste like tomato - and certainly not ketchup! Have I really been living under a rock all these years? Wow.

So, having a bit more knowledge on the subject, I decided to check-out Pai, a Thai restaurant currently getting a lot of media attention. Though I really don't think anyone is surprised since Nuit and Jeff Regular, the owners of Pai, are also the team behind Sabai Sabai and Sukhothai (they were also heavily involved with Khao San Road - a hugely popular restaurant in Toronto until 2013). I have yet to visit Khao San Road, Sabai Sabai and Sukhothai, but believe me, a visit is in the works.

Let me tell you what I thought of my experience at Pai...

What I LOVED

They take reservations!
The prices are reasonable - every main is under $20
The portions are good - even took some to go for lunch the next day
The staff was friendly and service was efficient
The music was awesome! We all agreed that if they had the music for sale, we would all have purchased it
They do separate bills
They are accommodating when it comes to allergies or when you want an ingredient omitted. For example, I hate onions so I did not want onions in my food, one guest has a gluten intolerance so she has to stay away from food that contains or touches gluten, and a second guest was allergic to shellfish - the three of us were able to enjoy a delicious dinner with the items we cannot have omitted from our dishes
And the best part...

The food was fricking delicious! As in ridiculously good!

I ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($14) sans onions with chicken and holy hell, I don't know what crap I had been eating before, but whatever it was, I could never eat it again. This Pad Thai was made with fried rice noodles, home-made tamarind sauce, beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. I think I am going to have to figure out how to make the tamarind sauce so that I could slather it on everything! Put it on my toast? Sure! At one point I turned to my neighbor and offered her some. First she said she only wanted a small bite, and then she asked for a second, and finally she called our waitress over and asked for an order of the Pad Thai to go.

What I did NOT love so much

Beer options are limited and not very good. Not a single IPA on the menu
The seats are not very comfortable and when you sit down it feels like the chair may break
The space can get crowded and loud - though I noticed that the chairs in the main dining area (we were seated in a more private part of the restaurant to the left), were sturdier looking. :)
When sitting with a large group, as I was, it felt like we were almost sitting on each other's laps
My guests complained about the spice levels being off. Specifically, several of my guests wanted their food super spicy and ordered the Farang Spicy (foreigner spicy), and did not find it spicy at all

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Pai, and after experiencing what real Thai food should taste like, I am eagerly anticipating my next Thai food adventure. Now I just have to decide which of these restaurants I should check out next: Khao San Road, Sabai Sabai or Sukhothai?"}
{"text":"UHMAZING ! This place was recommended by a friend but we couldn't get reservations at first so we went elsewhere (had I only known what I was missing ) Good enough when my sister came for a visit we got a table for 2pm lunch (they're that good it's always packed) . I loved it!! So when the BF and I  knew we were going to be in the area,  I made sure to reserve and book online. Much to my dismay it was fully booked! Even with alternatives I gave this place another shot. Tried to walk in and got lucky, a table for two with no wait time !! (5:30pm) woooohooo ! the place was starting to fill up but I didn't mind being Squeezed in a table by the corner . The BF and I LOVED IT! The food was full of flavour and tasty !! We split the Grabong (squash fritters) , Pad Gra Pow with the crispy pork, the Pad Thai, and dessert (there's only one). Everything and I mean every dish was delicious !  We went to watch a musical but this for me was part of the highlight of our evening. Definitely a Must to try and even a staple on my food list. Not cheap but not super expensive either . We paid $60 between two people but we were full up to the next day. Talk about stuffing ourselves. Did I say I love it ??! Ummmmm uhmmm  daydreaming about each dish all over again."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Thai food I've ever had. Visited here from New York, and taken by someone who's been to and eaten all around Thailand. Thoroughly impressed by the flavor, balance, and portions."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and I love the different level of spice that you can select from. A great place for lunch and dinner and I love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Extremely great food! Only took about 1.5 hours to be seated. Worth the wait but be amazed by the food. Americans-be prepped because the reservations uses phone numbers to let them know the table is ready. You may have to wait at the restaurant for your table."}
{"text":"I love their pad Thai it's one of the best downtown. Perfect ratio of sauce which is made with tamarind and not that gross ketchup flavour. You can also choose your spice level! Definitely recommend booking a table in advance as they can get very busy."}
{"text":"This place is so good that it is ridiculous. Authentic, quaint, and with the best service. Every item in the menu is fabulous. Worth my two hour drive from Buffalo. That is all I need to say, really. Come early. It gets packed. That is the only drawback. There is a host that has no personality, but the waitstaff is fantastic and friendly. 5 stars all the way, despite the jerk host."}
{"text":"My goodness. I've been to this place about 7 times (and counting!) and their food is so consistently amazing. No wonder this place is always packed in the evenings! The atmosphere is always upbeat and lively while the staff are attentive and very friendly.

Their Pad Thai is hands-down the best Pad Thai I have ever had and I find myself craving it all the time (even immediately after I leave the restaurant). What a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Unreal & delicious! Best curry:D amazing food and can't wait to be back. chef Is the best I've ever encountered in Toronto."}
{"text":"Honestly pretty disappointed. Both times I've had pai the girl I spoke to on the phone was rude to me. The food isn't bad but didn't meet my expectations and it's overpriced compared to other Thai food in the city. Won't go back."}
{"text":"After bringing my girlfriend here for a date, we've been craving Pai regularly. The food is amazing and great environment and service."}
{"text":"Great bartender/server made an excellent cocktail and very good entree of ground pork.  The killer was coconut sorbet for dessert- YUM!  A bit overpriced and more trendy than anything else.  More for the 'happening' crowd rather than true diners."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat Thai food but I'm so glad we checked out this place! Every dish is about $13-15 and you can add on different meats to change it up. 

I can't even begin to tell you what I got. Some form of rice with beef and fish sauce. My friend got the fried rice. My other friend got the coconut curry with noodles or something. Everything was delicious!!!! We also grabbed some starters, spring rolls and deep fried shrimp which was the best starters I've had in a long time! You have to get it. 

Oh and saving the best for last.... The Pai sangria $11 for a glass was on FIRE. HELL YES I'd pay for that. Expensive but yolo right? 

Sit out on the patio, enjoy a glass and eat good food with great friends. That's what it's all about."}
{"text":"Obviously a classic in Toronto. Always make a reservation (sometimes, you might have to book a couple months out given how popular this place is) If you do choose to wait in line, don't be surprised if you end up waiting over an hour. Otherwise, drop by for lunch on a weekday.

Their squash fritters are awesome. Definitely order that as an app."}
{"text":"Come to Pai to try authentic Thai!!! Ok, but on a less lighter note, Pai lived up to its hype as the food was superb. 

We went to pai on a Sat night, and upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised by its vibrant, busy and lively atmosphere. 
 
We tried Thai tea for the first time. It was a lightly flavored black tea that had a hint of cream making it slightly sweet and refreshing.

We ordered 3 different dishes to try. 
1) Miang Kung 
        An interesting dish that required us to make our own wrap with different ingredients (mentioned in the menu). There was an example of how to make the wrap. Combining all of the ingredient on the betel leaf created a balanced explosion of zesty, tangy, spicy, and savory flavors 

2) Chef Nuit Pad Thai (with chicken)
         Signature dish that lived up to its expectations. Best Pad Thai I have ever tasted. 

3) Khao Soi (with braised beef)
         It was a great light and sweet curry. However I would suggest not drinking too much of the curry soup. 

We would definitely come back with a larger appetite to try other items on the menu.

Tip: Make a reservation"}
{"text":"The sweat is still pouring off my brow as I effortlessly lick the bottom of my coconut curry bowl. My damn tongue isn't long enough to reach the bottom!
This food is SO good! The best Thai cuisine I have had ever. 
I'm Ukranian, so I know Thai food!
Trust me. 
It's good. It's priced good too."}
{"text":"Upon arriving at Pai, I was told to expect a wait time of approximately 30 minutes. They had told me to leave my number and would text me when there is an availability. This gave us some time to go for a nice walk around Toronto to burn off some calories! Finally, when my phone lit up, so did my face. I was excited! 

All the options on the menu looked good; however, I decided to be safe and pick the Pad Thai with medium spice. The food was presented on a leaf, which was quite unique. From my first bite, I was blown away and my taste buds went crazy. The Pad Thai was very flavorful and delicious. The sauce had the right balance in richness and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because of the chicken. I found it to be rubbery and flavorless, which was quite disappointing. Overall, I would definitely come back for dinner again!"}
{"text":"So hard to reserve a table here, so instead, my friend and I popped up early Saturday morning when it first opened to grab a seat. 
We ordered the fruit shakes, which was good, but it's a lot of drink that we are unable to finish.
I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with beef and my friend ordered the Pad Thai I think. Both dishes were delicious. I ordered mine medium spicy as at Salad King that's my go to spiciness level, man, was that spicy - warning here, their spiciness is way spicier than other places. The first couple of bites I'm so glad I got the fruit shakes to help my tongue, but later on the pad gra prow got less spicy (probably since it's at the bottom and it didn't reach there).
Would definitely go back, but I'll know not to order medium next time."}
{"text":"Wish we had Thai food of this caliber in Chicago. Ordered the tom yum soup and khao soi. The soup was fantastic! Perfectly balanced sweet, sour & salty flavors. The khao soi was super-flavorful but half-way through the dish I wished there were more herbs or lime to brighten the flavor as the curry was very heavy. Nonetheless, still enjoyed the food and would gladly return. Went for takeout on a Wednesday night around 7p, there were still some bar seats open but most of the open tables were reserved. Definitely make reservations."}
{"text":"Beat tai in Toronto hands down.  Also a hangover cure, their spicy pad thai w chicken is amazing, coconut chicken green curry is on point and their kau soy noodle dish w chicken is a discovery me and my girl love."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday and there was a 45 minute wait. Boy was the wait worth it. I love the story this place had to tell. Small town thai folks open a restaurant in Toronto. Not your usual red curry, pad thai place. They have a unique menu. I had a soup with crispy noodles served on the side. We tried their chicken satay, green curry. I wish I remembered the dishes as they were quite amazing. It really offers a unique menu and a unique dialogue. I have to go back again and update my review."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Atmosphere was really nice, cool mix of Thai and rock and roll in a cozy environment. The food was just not that great. Had the Thai iced tea - meh. The pad thai was way too dry and I also had the khao soi (egg noodles in a yellow curry-like soup/paste) - the soup was literally a thick creamy sauce. Not appetizing. We both finished a quarter of our plate before giving up. Service was also unfriendly in our case."}
{"text":"Great place. The squash fritters and green curry are amazing. Only downside is the wait times for a table."}
{"text":"Finally made it here! Arrived around 7 on a Saturday night and was told we would have to wait about 45 minutes but we were seated after 20. Started off with cocktails.. Loved the Plum Mule. 
Once at our table, everything was great. Really friendly server with some great recommendations. We loved all of our food! It's a fun and busy place and we all left feeling happy! 
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Now this place was awesome! Very cool vibe, busy and excited energy. Ordered spring rolls (best I've ever had), tom yum soup (really nice broth, too much fish sauce for my hubby tho) a chicken curry and rice noodle dish. 5/5"}
{"text":"Pretty much the closest thing you'll get to Northern Thai food in Toronto. Food does not disappoint though. Pretty sure this comes close to the most expensive delivery I've ever ordered, however this place keeps bringing back time and time again. 

Top 3: 
1. Khao Soi - Curry with egg noodle goodness that I always order. Careful with the spice levels as clearly warned by the order taker every time. I fail to listen, and always get Thai Spicy. 

2. Chef's Pad Thai - Super authentic and massive portions. You won't find ketchup in this noodle dish! Toasted peanuts and fresh bean sprouts makes this dish extremely addicting. 

3. Pad Gra Prow - Rice dish with fried egg and pork. Make sure to get it with pork! The little bits of crispy cracklin make it extra delish!"}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest, I stumbled into this restaurant because we couldn't get seats at Khao San Road.

Never have I ended up so happy with changing dinner plans before. 
Pai is edgy, innovative, and delectable. 

Highly recommend the following: Chef Nuit Pad Thai, Gaeng Masaman with braised beef, Khao Soi with Beef and Gaeng Kiaw Wan with Chicken

The dish I enjoyed the most was definitely the Khao Soi. It has been awhile since I have tasted braised beef so tender. The mix of fresh egg noodles in golden curry, topped with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions and shrimp paste was so exquisite and pleasing to the palate. 

I also really love how they served the green curry in a real coconut.

Make sure to order their Pineapple Cocktail, which is served with 2 oz of Malibu in an actual pineapple! 

I would definitely recommend complementing your curry with the classic Thai Iced Tea. The sweetness of the tea and spiciness of your curry strangely go very well together.

I really liked the vibe of the restaurant as well. It is a bit dim, but very lively. People were surprisingly well-dressed as well. It can get a little loud, but not so rowdy that you can't hold a conversation. 

Despite the proximity and similarity in dishes, I would honestly choose Pai over Khao San Rd. now. The pricing is cheaper at Pai and the wait is shorter. Pai also takes reservations."}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom. Everything we got was delicious. We had a plate of chicken skewers for an appetizer. It came with two different sauces: one pasty and the other like a vinaigrette. Chef Nuit Pad Thai was tasty. I got it mild, but I think I could have gone for medium or even spicier for more flavour. Green curry that was served in a coconut was amazing. 

The restaurant was crazy busy on an early Friday evening yet the service was pretty fast and attentive. This place is small so it may not be best for big groups. The atmosphere is casual and the crowd is young."}
{"text":"My wife and I both enjoy thai food, so when this popped up as a nearby restaurant while we were visiting Toronto, we gave it a shot.  The reviews looked promising so that certainly helped in our decision.  There was a moderate wait when we got there so we browsed the menu while grabbing a drink at the bar.  She drank a thai mojito that she very much enjoyed while I had a sake bomb (Saturday night shot special).  We then were taken to our seats and started with some spring rolls which were delicious.  I got myself a beer stein of Sapporo (loved the huge beer steins!) and she had their Sangria which was alright.
For the main course I had their Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken at the Thai spicy level (which they advertise as being as spicy as it gets).  I've done this in the past at other thai restaurants and feel that sometimes they hold back still.  I felt the spice level was great, but would not have minded an even spicier kick to this dish.  Regardless, everything about this dish was delicious and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  My wife got the Pad Cha Hett which she thought was very good.  Since this dish only comes as mild, my wife did ask for hot chili oil on the side to spice it up a bit and they had no problem accommodating that.

Overall, we were very pleased with our decision to come here.  I know some of the other reviews question the service, which from what I observed they seemed very busy.  We did have to wait a bit for a refill on water, but otherwise I thought the wait staff were attentive enough.  I'm sure this can be hit and miss depending on the time but the food itself was so good that I'm sure anyone dining here will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is truly amazing and staff are friendly, despite being run off their feet. The only downside is how busy the place always is, so you're almost always guaranteed a wait but, within reason, the wait is always worth it. Go. Eat. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here at 6:00pm on a Wednesday night. We didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat us right away at the bar. Overall the food tasted a notch better than any Thai food I've had in the past (never been to Thailand though). The interior was cozy, but loud. Must order with any meal is the Thai iced tea--it's excellent here!!"}
{"text":"I have been back to Pai for many times after the first review and it never disappoints me and my dates.  I have tried different items on the menu in each visit and they are all tasty. I love Thai spicy level and I can taste different depths of spice in each dish. 

The service and kitchen management have improved and stabilized since the grand opening. Lunch is very fast even though it is always full. The best thing is it takes reservation; therefore, it makes one of my regular lunch celebration spot with my friends and coworkers. If I didn't make reservation, I would go before noon to try to get a seat at the bar. 

Another one good thing is there are a lot of choices of food that you can share with friends. Food decor / container and placement are beautiful; they always look good in photos. :)"}
{"text":"Everyone comes to Pai for the Green Curry and Khao Soi but tend to neglect the other items on the menu. The Laap Salad was not what I had expected. The salad was more in the form of lettuce wraps than an actual salad. The mixes of spice along with the ground pork, veggies and sticky rice wrapped in lettuce had an explosive amount of flavour to it,  but in a good way."}
{"text":"Very nice place. A little pricy for Thai food but it is really good Thai food so it is worth it. The menu is a little hard to read and the place is very loud, mostly because it is always busy so don't expect to be able to have a quiet conversation. Just bring some spicy friends like like some good spicy food."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try out PAI in downtown Toronto! Have heard really good review of this place from tons of friends so I decided to come and try out!

I made reservation couple months ago because they're always fully booked and if you come walk in, good luck in waiting for hours to get a table cuz this place is PACKED!! However, they're so considerate that having a corner for you to sit and grab a drink while waiting which is pretty nice during this winter time 

Their service was good in general, from the moment I came until leaving the restaurant, all the staffs are nice and polite! 

We ordered Som Tum Tad (papaya salad) with salted crab for starter, it was quite a bit too spicy for me considering I don't have a high tolerance in spicy food  although we only ordered medium spicy...but honestly the salad is really good other than the fact that is spicy and the crab itself is too little in portion so I'd recommend getting shrimp than crab in this dish 

Next, I ordered Khao Soi with braised beef cuz I've seen good reviews of this dish on yelp so I had a pretty high expectation for it. I'm not sure if I had my expectation too high, the soup base is too sweet for me personally...that's something I was disappointed about  but the noodles was chewy and not mushy, and I think they fried some noodles and have it on the side which gives me an interesting texture when eating everything in a bit with a little bit of crunchiness 

My overall experience here is nice and I would wanna come again and try their curry and pad Thai
Oh! And just a heads up for their portion is slightly smaller than other restaurant that you normally go to so one starter and two mains would be good for two person if you didn't eat anything before dinner"}
{"text":"With so many great reviews, I had to try this spot out for myself!! 

I love the atmosphere of this place, very relaxed and comfortable! 

My go-to when visiting 98% of Thai restaurants is pad Thai, so I ordered the veggie pad Thai and wow was it good!! 

Perfectly cooked tofu, flavourful sauce and an abundance of delicious veggies.

It was a massive portion, but I still managed to finish it all because it was so good!! 

I also got the 'Summer Dog' cocktail and it was great! The lychee paired with peach schnapps was a perfect combination. 

Don't miss this Thai place ... Definitely one of my new favourites!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great food, great atmosphere and great drinks. I love thai food and this is one of my favourites. I am never disappointed. This is one of those places I love taking other people to, whether it is my parents or some friends. My favourite dishes would be the squash fritters, chef nuit pad thai and the coconut green curry."}
{"text":"My current favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto. It is always jammed and can be a little noisy but the taste of the food is amazing!  There is usually a lineup but they are super good at getting everyone seated asap. 

They also make an incredible Old Fashion."}
{"text":"Went for lunch ... Crowded AF. Sat at the bar and got the shrimp and rice dish with a sweet sauce on the side. It was alright with the over sweet thai iced tea. Extra star for the ever smiling bartender. Food took forever to come out... Considering it was from the standard lunch menu it was a no-no.  My hungry stomach was getting upset.  Wanted the highly rated squash fries but alas it wasn't a part of the lunch menu. Would go back to check the dinner menu. Worth trying to get reservations as it seems popular with the local crowd."}
{"text":"really liked the atmosphere they created, it was warm and friendly
we were greeted by a guy who was very friendly, and we did not have to wait, which was great.
food was great, price was reasonable 
I would recommend here !"}
{"text":"Came here for Toronto BBQ week and got the Pork Belly Sandwich with a pint
Very good and definitely a good place for lunch"}
{"text":"Make sure you come here at least an hour early before your preferred time because that's how long the wait is. I've been here 3x and each time, we waited for at least an hour, regardless of party size. the food is amazing and so are the drinks!"}
{"text":"Maybe I didn't try the right things but this place doesn't do it for me. I believed the hype and was let down. The mango drink is yummy but we had the spring rolls, tom yum soup, pad gra prow and gaeng kiaw wan (served in a coconut). Don't get me wrong, the food was good but there is definitely better in the city.
It is charming that they name their drinks after the Raptors (Toronto forever!)"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out because the wait was too long. Our 5 meals took about 30-40 minutes to make, which is understandable considering how busy it was. 

.... AND THE WAIT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT! I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with ground pork. This must be eaten with the magical fish sauce that comes with it. Once mixed in, the meal is extra delicious and has a unique taste to it. This is the best Thai food I've EVER had. I am definitely going to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pai a few times now and typically I get green curry (LOVE) but i noticed this time, only 4 pieces of chicken in the dish. I've also sampled the menu and was impressed with the coconut shrimp among lots of others. My friend really didn't like the curry but never said anything.. we sat there with a full meal in front of her and no service for a while. When the waiter came back he asked if she wanted anything else but didn't comment on the full plate of curry in front of her. Just not the best experience, she was turned off but ordered the shrimp to go. I've experienced way better... I hope things aren't going down hill for you Pai..."}
{"text":"I came to Pai for a late lunch and it was busy, but I was seated right away. I started with the tom yum soup which was small, but significant with 3-4 large prawns in it and a variety of veggies. It tasted very authentic, but for $7 I would have liked a bigger portion.

I got the khao soi with chicken leg (because dark meat is way better than white meat am I right?!) and my friend got the chicken pad thai. The khao soi was delicious, as was the pad thai. 

The service is great, my glass was never empty and they brought me a bowl for my bones without me even asking. The servers are very attentive, which can be hard in such a packed restaurant. Would be 5 stars if the portions were larger. You pay around the same price at Sukothai and get WAY more."}
{"text":"One of three places I like to think of as the 'holy trinity' of Thai food in Toronto (other two being Khao San Road and Sukho Thai...and maybe Sabai Sabai but that ruins the trinity). Pai has great dishes. My personal favorites are the Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and Khao Soi. But I do feel that the quality of their Pad Thai has slipped a bit recently in terms of flavour. I've gone on several occasions and the rest of my party has never been disappointed.  We usually get a couple of appetizers to share. Our favorite is the Gra Pong. The menu is pretty much the same as the rest of the trinity. Taste is practically the same as well, apart from the Pad Thai, which I think Sukho Thai does the best job of. Pai's bonus is that you can reserve a table online. Great for small or large groups, as long as you reserve early."}
{"text":"Pai pai pai! I would definitely recommend this joint. Pai has been on my hit list for quite some time now. When I finally had the chance to go, I took it! The experience was pretty good. Just what I expected. 

I ordered their khao soi and their mojito. The khao soi is a peanut based sauce/noodle soup. I usually get it with beef. It's amazing. Yum! Loved it. The flavours are very strong, not overpowering but hearty. Definitely worth it. Even tho it's a little pricey, it's worth it. I don't give a lot of 5s out, but for what it's worth, I enjoyed it. 

Definitely coming back to try more!! Try to reserve or come in early! 

$$ -15-25ish"}
{"text":"Authentic northern Thai food, only place in TO that comes close to food I had in Chiang Mai"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just a bad night but Khao San Road never had a bad night in my experience. Honestly lets just say if I had pai before Khao San Road I wouldn't try anymore thai places like this.

Was in the first batch of dinner customers on Friday night. Ordered the fried squash fritters (Grabong) and they were not crispy at all and tasted a little soggy as if they were pre-made. Khao San Road quality was much better.

Ordered the Ice Thai Tea but the crushed icce didn't work for me. Diluted the drink much faster. Khao San Road had cubed ice and so did the ones in San Diego.

Ordered the Pad thai and the Pad Gra Prow with crispy pork. It was ok but nothiing memorable and nothing I would crave for again unlike at Khao San Road.

The only real advantage I see is less wait and bigger roomier place.

Although they say the chef came from Khao San Road, the quality they put out for me was well below the quality and consistency of Khao San Road.... speaking about it makes me miss Khao San Road.

Not sure if I would go back to Pai but if I do, I hope the quality steps up a bit..."}
{"text":"Yum!  Since the opening of Pai, I no longer go to KSR.  The vibe here is so much more chill and the servers are incredibly nice!  The food is delicious and their dessert, coconut rice with mango is incredible.  They also have more selection to their regular menu.  Their morning glory app is incredible."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food!!
Good service attitude and lovely restaurant, but u need to wait.
I love their green curry and pad thai.
They put curry into a coconut, which is very creative and cute, I also ate the coconut meat after i finished my curry. 
My advice is some of the meals temperature need to be hotter ;)"}
{"text":"Great lunch but often a busy place. Need to show up right at noon or else stay in line."}
{"text":"I'd say one of the best thai restaurant I've ever eaten in downtown Toronto. Way better than Salad King for sure and any other thai restaurant for that matter. The fried fish with green curry sauce and the papaya salad was my fave dish. I'd definitely be back here with some group of friends and i would recommend families and friends to come here to eat some flavourful thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"Ordered the golden beef curry - it was outstanding."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai restaurant in town! There's always a line up here so be prepared to wait but the it's worth it! 

I've been here a couple times and my favourite is the tong yum soup . I also like the chicken wings and skewers! All their curries are delicious and the pad Thais are amazing too ! 

Service is prompt and friendly even though it's always busy there."}
{"text":"Inspired by chang mai, their pad thai is a bit different from the usual you are use to... I still love it! the more original the better ;)"}
{"text":"Loved every dish at this vibrant relaxed restaurant. Friday night and glad we had reservations. We were a party of 8 and each dish was delicious. Highlights I'd say were the squash fries, sautéed water spinach, and my fave massamam curry. Note-the spice level Medium is pretty spicy."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Pai Northern Thaï Kitchen ! I had heard many good things about it and went with a regular. I tried the green curry - which came with medium heat - with chicken and bamboo shoots. The cocoanut milk in the curry balanced the spice perfectly so it was not too spicy and came with a side of rice. The curry was served inside a cocoanut so extra props for creativity ! Since the cocoanut was not very large, they provided extra curry in a side bowl. I tried a bite of the pad Thai as well and it was very good. 

The atmosphere was casual and the space itself was very large, but separated into several rooms so it was easy to carry on conversation with your group. The only unfortunate event was that the fire alarms went off because someone opened a fire door. All of the staff were extremely apologetic and kind. 
 
Can't wait to go back already !"}
{"text":"I attended a Zomato Meetup where I caught up with fellow food bloggers and ate delicious Northern Thai cuisine! Pai is one of the many Thai restaurants owned by Chef Nuit and her husband, Jeff. You might not know them, but you probably know their most popular restaurant, Khao San Road!

I had the pleasure of trying a variety of dishes during this event that are also on the regular menu. The Som Tum Tad (Papaya Salad) was the starting appetizer. I was confused by the set up of the dish, because it looked like it was a one person portion. Regardless, everyone tried to take equally small portions for themselves. It was my least favourite dish out of everything we've tried.

The first main dish was the Gaeng Kiaw Wan (Green Curry) served with rice. I enjoyed this curry quite a bit. To make it more fun, it was served in a coconut! Shortly thereafter, our second main dish was Chef Nuit Chicken Pad Thai Platter. The pad thai was quite delicious too. The third dish was a surprise dish. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a hold of the plate's name. Judging by the ingredients from their online menu, I guessed it was the Plah Nua (Beef Salad). For this dish, you have sticky rice and cooked beef. You take the rice and scrunch it up into a ball with your hand. Then, you stick the beef onto the rice and eat it together using your hands. It was a new experience for me. I wasn't crazy about this plate compared to the pad thai and curry. It was cool to try regardless.

Lastly, we had dessert. It was mango sticky rice and I enjoyed it more than I expected! The sweetness of the mango along with the sticky rice made a great combo. Despite having a couple of my own drinks, I got to sample a fellow foodie's cocktail. I HIGHLY recommend you order the Tea Ross. It's a delicious spiked Thai iced tea. I would go back to Pai for this drink and I never order cocktails or alcohol at a restaurant (only at pubs).

Overall, I loved my experience at Pai. I would definitely recommend it if you have tried Khao San Road or want to eat some Thai food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Honestly, the BEST Thai food in the city. Cool, funky atmosphere, excellent dishes. It's so nice to see the former team from Khao San Road continue in yet another highly successful venture. I cannot rave about this place enough - from the atmosphere, to the music, great staff and stellar food, everything is completely on-par and top notch. I will keep coming back and this is truly my only go-to thai restaurant (other than Sukho-Thai) in the city."}
{"text":"Great location and environment. Not the best thai food I've had but very decent. Even the mild is spicy - be careful."}
{"text":"Really frackin' good. 
I went on a weekend in the afternoon, and there was tons of space for me and my two friends. The server was attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was really chill.  
I had the Khao Soi and it was a thick curry with perfectly cooked noodles. Very filling and delicious. I asked for medium spiciness and that was a very good level of spice to warm you up without burning your tongue. My friend got the Pad Thai with the most extreme spiciness; I took one bite and my mouth was on fire for a good five minutes, with lingering sensations for another twenty minutes! I tried my other friend's Masaman Curry and it was very fragrant and yummy, I don't think you can really go wrong at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars on yelp? Well deserved. They use some kind of spices that make their food seem like it's on steroids. Everything was so aromatic, tasty, fresh, and authentically Thai.

The atmosphere is loud and resembles a market-esque restaurant. The line goes out the door, so you better grab a reservation or get takeout if you want to be in and out of this place.

For appetizers, we ordered the northern Thai sausage. You could tell that the sausage was made in house and was stuffed with fresh herbs and spices. 

It came with a house special sauce for dipping, sticky rice, and some crunchy lettuce/cucumbers. The combination has various textures and flavours that compliment each other and accent the juicy sausage. Definitely would order this again.

The khao soi that is so loved at this location, has definitely earned its reputation. The coconut milk, spices, chicken, and egg noodles were prepared to perfection. Best khao soi I've had so far. I would also want to sample the beef version in the future.

Bf got the masaman chicken which he loved as well.

For dessert, we ordered the mango sticky rice. My boyfriend was surprised because he said that the mango they used reminded him of the sweet juicy mangoes he's used to from Taiwan. Tastes like candy and they coat the sticky rice with a touch of condensed milk. Highly recommend this for dessert.

The bill was quite pricey, coming to $70 for the both of us. It was definitely worth every penny. The spices and food are too good to miss if you're in the area. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The food here is just outstanding.  I will never ever buy pad Thai anywhere other than a proper Thai place any more.

Eating the pad Thai is an experience.  It's like watching a feel good movie that only comes along once every 10 years.  You feel amazing, you feel satisfied, you feel changed.  

Anybody that has anything negative to say about the food here is simply wrong or is confused in life.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant of all time. Their food is delicious! I had the green curry in the coconut and squash fritters when I stayed in. I had the most spiciest (wished it was spicier) but still so amazing! They had amazing cocktail drinks and next time I will try their Thai ice tea, it was on almost every table when I came in! 

This place was amazing, super busy because everyone is familiar with PAI! It is a must try when you're in downtown Toronto! I can't wait til I bring my boyfriend to try this place! 

I gave it a four star because even though it was the best Thai restaurant in town. It's super busy, always. I can see why, the food speaks for itself! But that being said, my coworkers and I always find it a challenge to call in a take out and sometimes they never pick up! There was two times that we wanted to order take out at work and it was frustrating so we end up ordering at a different place. I was also there on Tuesday and forgot my blanket scarf there, I tried calling that night for it and the next day, no one returned or picked up my phone call. Hopefully, it is still there if I have time to pick it up when I'm not busy at work!

Tip: do make reservations ahead of time if you're planning to eat in! Saves the trouble and so much time!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Pai! It's a great place to come with absolutely anyone if you want a more than average Thai restaurant! Although I do feel that their menu is a bit similar to their rival - Khao San Road but they do a better job at keeping up with the standard and quality over the years. Staff is always friendly, food is always hot and fresh! 

Food: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Staff: 5/5
Price: 4/5 (a bit pricey for the type of street food you are getting, but hey, you are in Toronto.)
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Awesome. Perfectly spiced. Squash fritters were great. Gaeng masaman was some great curry."}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews I had high expectations for this place. Was disappointed. Everything was just okay- maybe my expectation was too high . We had the shrimp green curry, chicken Thai noodle dish, shrimp appetizer and the squash appetizer ! Also had the lemonade . Maybe I was having an off day - did not enjoy any of the dishes !"}
{"text":"If you're wanting great authentic Thai, have a lot of patience and head here ... the wait is long and constant.  If you're lucky and planned waaay ahead, you can score a Rez and slip pass the line up out the door.

Pai is Kiin's and Sabai Sabai louder and more vibrant sibling with its open Thai market feel.  Lights and flags hang about in the darker rustic dining space.  They really pack it in with maybe 10 inches between you and another table.  Service here is quick as they turn over the tables so fast to bring in more people.  

Thai iced tea - perfect drink for the summer.  Strong black tea compliments the sweetened condensed milk.  The milk gives a nice richness to the tea.  I love how this isn't watered down.  It is very sweet but it's not a bad thing here.  4/5 

Grabong (squash fritters) - A must get! This awesome app arrives nearly toppling over the plates.  Shredded squash is a maze of delicious crunch and crispy edges ... add the sweet Thai chili sauce and you'll definitely be eyeing every piece to sneak from your table mates.  5/5

Kung tawt sa-moon prai (garlic shrimp) - another excellent starter.  Big pieces of shrimp are batter and then deep fried up crispy.  They're not rubbery but still quite tender.  Warning to those on a date ... garlic is delicious but potent.  Bring a breath mint! 4/5

Pad Cha Hett (vegan stir fried mushrooms) - completely appreciate they have a vegan dish here.  It's authentic with its use of pungent fermented sauces.  My only issue ... it is just a handful of vegetables.  Maybe 10 pieces of snow pieces with the mushroom on top of a huge portion of rice.  3/5

Gaeng masaman (braised beef in a peanut tamarind curry) - large pieces of beef and potato float in a super flavourful curry that has a good dose of peanut and tamarind.  I really enjoyed the sauce in this one and found it much better in terms of value compared to the Pad Cha Hett. 4/5

Overall, awesome Thai meal that seems quite affordable at first but the value is a bit of a miss on a few dishes.  The apps are incredible though ... I'd come back for those alone!"}
{"text":"I've come here many times for lunch and dinner and it has always been a lovely experience. It's hard to get a dinner reservation but it's possible to score a table with a minimal wait if you walk-in before 7pm - best to come in a group of 3 or less. I'd avoid Fridays/Saturday nights though because there's a huge pre-club crowd and lines aren't worth it. I'm a huge fan of Chef Nuit's dishes. Their flavours have much more depth than the average Thai place and the food comes in good portions for the price. 

Fav dishes:
- Chef Nuit Pad Thai: the oyster sauce makes it shine. Flavourful but light
- Gaeng Masaman: really tender beef in a rich curry
- ok, all the curries are delicious

The interiors are eclectic and industrial with the vibe of a streetside eatery - warning: there are coat hooks but not much space otherwise. It can get quite cold in the winter cause the queue keeps the door open. Staff are down-to-earth and work fast."}
{"text":"Pai is a truly authentic Thai place I always like to go to. The vibe is cool and the food tastes great. It's conveniently located in downtown Toronto close to all the major attractions. The service is reasonably fast and attentive given how big this place is.

I honestly can't say anything negative about it and I'm a pretty picky guy. I just like 'em :)

Check 'em out if you're into Thai food and form your own opinion. IMO, Thai food is one of the best in the world along with Japanese, South American and Indian, as long as it's authentic, 'cause there are PLENTY of crappy ethnic restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Hard to find really good Thai food in Toronto. This was my first visit to Pai, but I was impressed. Cool atmosphere and great food! 

I like spicy food, so I ordered my Pad Thai \"Thai spicy\". For once, it was actually hot! They don't mess around with the heat here, so if you like hot food be sure to order it Thai spicy for an impressive, endorphin inducing kick."}
{"text":"Thai Iced tea ($5.50)
This was quite expensive, but I guess it can be justified since it's a big glass. The thing is, it was way to sweet and with it being so sweet it was difficult to finish it all. I know Thai iced teas are naturally really sweet, but this was just a bit too much for my liking.

Thai Chicken Wings ($5.50)
Came with 3 large wings - this was tasty. I really liked it. They were actually large wings which I liked, well marinated and went well with the sweet and spicy dipping sauce.

Pad Thai with Pork ($15.50)
I suppose pork wasn't the best meat to go with pad thai, but we ordered chicken wings and khao soi with beef so figured we would ask for a different type of meat. The pork meat is not that great, meat was slightly dry. You can choose your level of spiciness which we chose mild. You can rarely taste any spice in mild, if you like more of a kick i would go for the Medium. I liked the flavor of the pad thai. Definitely my favorite dish for the night.

Khao Soi with Beef ($15.50)
This was slightly disappointing. I don't know why but at all the Thai places I go and order Khao Soi, there is always so little noodles inside. Same case here. There was a decent amount of beef but the beef meat were slightly tough, not as tender as I'd hope it to be. The Khao soi flavor was slightly bland, was expecting more of a stronger taste.

Honestly, I think this place is over-hyped. Thank god I came here early, just before 6pm and avoided a line. The food is good but definitely not worth the wait - I've had better Thai food elsewhere. It's funny because the waitress was telling us the owner of Pai is the same owner as Suko thai and other top thai restaurants in Toronto. My experience didn't feel that way though.

Seems like they update their menu pretty often. Noticed they increased some of their food items by $0.50 in 6 months..."}
{"text":"I like the rustic decor and the food is pretty good. Price is reasonable and portions are good too.
It gets really busy during dinner time, so try to arrive early - although they have a waiting bar area luckily. 
It gets fairly loud in there, but that's just the type of place it is, bustling modern place."}
{"text":"Food, music, ambiance was incredible. I'm dining alone and just wanted to eat and roll so I wasn't paying much attention to service til the end when this guy Jonny is so caught up in telling the table next to me that some woman from SNL was there that he hands me the card thing takes it back, I thank HIM and he's just talking to the table and walks away. I initially left 20% but he came back to tell me the card machine was on the fritz so I had to do it again. How fortuitous. 

I gotta assume this place is amazing when the servers aren't star struck. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Great ambiance. Good service. Food is authentic! Ordered the pad Thai, fried rice and green curry. Perfect amount of spice."}
{"text":"Besides Salad King, Pai has been a go to place for me whenever I go out. I went here on Saturday for lunch. Ordered the green curry as usual. Had the Thai Ice Tea which I found to be a bit on the sweeter side. The curry was in a coconut which adds to the uniqueness. Although I was lacking in appetite from the previous night, it was a good curry. I would go back to it again to try out the pad thai."}
{"text":"Pai was a recommendation from a friend who is familiar with downtown Toronto and I'm so glad we made a visit. We arrived around 1:45pm on a Sunday not knowing that they open at 3pm on Sundays. We got some drinks nearby while we waited for the restaurant to open. We returned at 2:55pm and there were already a few people waiting outside. We were surprised there were other people trying to eat at such a random time. The restaurant opened and my boyfriend and I were seated. It was hard not to notice that within just 25 minutes of the restaurant opening at 3pm on a Sunday, it was nearly filled! At this point, we were thinking that this place must be good. 

We were right! We had Thai iced tea, green curry (served in a coconut), and pad Thai with shrimp. We enjoyed the Thai iced tea; it was definitely better than average. The green curry was really awesome and flavorful. The coconut that it is served in is small, so you get the rest of it in a regular bowl. The pad Thai was better than average as well. My boyfriend really liked the shrimp in particular. Our food came out in about 15 minutes after placing our orders. 

Very lovely ambiance with warm lighting. Good service. Great experience overall. Zero complaints. We were impressed!

{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for a table, got a drink at the bar while we waited. 

We ordered so many dishes because we were MARVED! Service was friendly and on point, atmosphere was like a Thai/Hippie/Hawaiian/retro vibe, pretty cool stuff on display! Good vibes, great service!

We got all the salads on the menu, the beef salad was delicious! Beef was perfectly cooked and the flavours were insane. The papaya salad was also packed with flavour and freshness. 
Sticky rice is a must!
The laap salad was my favourite, before we took a bite we were debating to ask the waiter if it came with a sauce to put on but we bit into and realized with that much flavour it was definitely not needed!

*****!!!!!!Their oxtail is to die for!!!!!!!*****

The green curry came in a fresh coconut and it was probably one of the best curries I've had. Light and creamy with big chunks of chicken.

The pad Thai was my least favourite, it was good and we only ordered it because we wanted to compare to other Thai places we've hit up. 

Definitely worth the wait, go now!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very live, and loud, but not to the point where you are shouting your lungs out. 

I have tried many Pad Thai's at different restaurants in the GTA, but this one still is yet to be the best! I also tried Khao Soi, however it was lukewarm when they brought out. I informed the waiter, they apologized and reheated the dish. (that's why they lost a star) 
Although it was reheated, it tasted amazing. 
Sticky rice is a must get too!"}
{"text":"My go-to dish here is the pork Pad Gra Prow which is described as \"Holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground Pork, Chicken, Beef or Tofu served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. (contains oyster sauce) Served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime).\"

The ground pork has a really great balance of sweet and savoury and tastes more like crumbled sausage than typical ground pork. Breaking the egg yolk over everything, but especially the rice, levels up the dish even further adding creaminess and bulk. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, splash some of the fish sauce over everything, to up the complexity and umami flavors even further. I've also tried the crispy pork version (pictured, $2 up charge) which has small chunks of Filipino-style lechon mixed in with the regular pork.

But wait...there's more...their homemade hot sauce is so good I might just marry it. It's oil-based and has some dried-up strands of something or other (maybe shrimp?) along with spices that ups your already delicious food that much further. 

Usually get take out but the decor is fun and chill and makes you feel like you're in some neighbourhood bar in the Southeast Pacific. Pro-tip: if you're getting take out, head straight to the back near the kitchen and order from the little booth.

Closest subway station is St. Andrew which is less than 5 minutes walk away.

The *only* reason this place gets 4 stars vs. 5 is the price. At almost $17, even at lunch, the Pad Gra Prow is something I can  afford once and awhile rather than something I'd get more regularly if I worked or lived downtown."}
{"text":"Yummy and delicious Thai food. I'm a big fan of the curries here. I don't think I have had a dish that wasn't really good. Of course, that's probably why it is always busy here. So yea you'll probably have to wait a bit and yea the service is a little slow, but keep yourself busy with some good company, have a beer, and soak in the atmosphere. Then when the food comes enjoy it, because you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"Not your run of the mill Thai restaurant. Interesting decor with upbeat music playing in the background. Not a fan of dimly lit restaurants. I know it's supposed to set the mood but it only makes me sleepy lol. I sat at one of the tables with bar stools and it wasn't very comfortable. There are hooks on the side of the table to hook your bags and jackets to but I think it would have been better to have hooks on the walls for jackets. Weren't a lot of hooks and if you were wearing a long coat, it'll drag on the ground. 

My friends got the Khao pla tawt (fish) and Khao soi, and I got the ox tail. No complaints about the fish and the only thing my friend had to say about the khao soi was that it was a little too creamy for her but if that's your thing then give it a try. 

I enjoyed my ox tail dish very much! The sauce was amazing and there was more meat than I expected. Meat was fall off the bone so very very tender. Haven't tried anything else there but definitely planning to!

It's a nice touch that they added the Wi-Fi password and network on the menu but unfortunately, it didn't work when I was there (Dec 15)."}
{"text":"Ohhhh yea. The meals I love the best are the one's that surprise me. After finding this place on Yelp, I ventured on over to see if I could walk in and grab a table. The place was jam packed and their was a decent wait, but luckily I was able to snag a seat the bar. The rest is history.

With old school r&b playing in the background, I ordered some fried spring rolls and vegetable pad Thai. While I was waiting I chatted it up with a bartender who gave me the low down on the restaurant as well as the area and where to go. After this great convo, the perfection on a plate arrived.

The spring rolls are absolutely delicious and dipping sauce was amongst the best I've had. I tended to think all Thai spring roll dipping sauces were the same, but clearly I was wrong. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. Either way, the dish was excellent.

The Pad Thai now, best I've ever had aside from what I ate in Thailand. Not too oily, little sweet, perfect mixture of noodles and vegetables and perfectly seasoned. It really was delicious. 

The service was excellent and I loved the upbeat vibe about the place. This place is great for group gatherings and overall just somewhere to go have a good time. Definitely will be back here at some point, and you should go check it out too!"}
{"text":"Pai Northern is the same owner as Khao San Road and Suhko Thai. Out of the 3 Pai is my favourite! Conveniently located downtown at King and Duncan.  The restaurant has a cool vibe and pretty casual.  The wait time is pretty long. Every time I go whether it's lunch or dinner there's always a lineup. Making reservations a week in advance will help. The food was amazing and so authentic.  Service is amazing.  The food comes super fast. We started off with the Thai sangria. It's a must try. They added pineapple pieces and lichees in the sangria such a nice touch. For appetizer we had the fries garlic shrimps it was amazing and the papaya salad so tasty. It comes with pork grinds and shrimp chips. Our mains we had pad tai with shrimps and the pad graw was amazing. It's came wit a bed of rice some ground pork and pieces of fried roast pork with a sunny side up fried egg as a finishing touch. We ordered so much food and was too full to have dessert but I have been to Pai many times and always had the mango sticky rice. It's a must try!! I can't say enough good things about Pai. Best Thai food in Toronto.!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is so popular. Maybe I put up my hope too high I don't know. We got lucky got a table right before rush hour, I just don't get the huge lineup, yeah the good was okay, but there are sooo many good restaurants in that area. Maybe I should give it second chance."}
{"text":"I've been to Pai a few times and unfortunately haven't branched out beyond the pad thai! It's delicious with the perfect balance of flavours. I've been to Thailand, and this is a fairly comparable version to what I ate there. It's a really satisfying and fresh dish without being overly greasy or heavy. 

Although it wouldn't stop me from ordering it, I think it's a bit overpriced. You don't get a lot of meat, especially if you order shrimp, which is an extra $2. 

I really want to try some other dishes here. Will definitely continue coming back for more pad thai (and maybe I'll eventually branch out)!"}
{"text":"This place was so packed and claustrophobic when I went in. Maybe it was the layout and the fact that the tables were so squished together that made me feel that way. Their pad Thai was good but nothing special. Wings were super hot and fresh when we got them which was a plus. Service was decent. They could definitely be more friendly."}
{"text":"Followed the yelp reviews to this cute place. Very busy and doesn't take reservations, but the weight wasn't long. Had the soups, spring rolls, wings and split a panang curry. Easily the best Thai I ever tried, and Thai is my favorite food."}
{"text":"I just came back from Thailand and this Restaurant food is better than anything I got from there. The flavours can't be beat. The ambience is unreal and feels like you are out of the country. Must try. Only downside is that it is so popular on weekends there is a wait."}
{"text":"Top-notch Thai

Came in during dinner time and there was a pretty good sign-in line, but it moves quickly. There's all sorts of interesting things to look at on the walls, so it goes fast. I got lucky with a place at the bar right away but most groups were waiting about 30 min. 
This place has a great vibe and the staff was very friendly. 
I'm a huge fan of Tom Yum soup, but I really wanted to try the Pad Gra Prow that everyone's talking about and some wings. Luckily, they have an appetizer size bowl of Tom Yum. I'm so happy I got it. It's easily the best Tom Yum I've ever had. Bold lemongrass flavor, as expected, but there's something else in there that gives it a very savory, almost hearty, feeling broth. Almost like there's a dash of tomato soup mixed in. It's so good. I almost ordered another bowl of it, but my other food came out.
Wings were very good. They were cooked perfectly and had a very nice thin crispy layer on them. Presentation was very nice too.
I've never had Pad Gra Pow before and I'm now sad about that fact. It was awesome! I will agree that it seems to be on the small side, but as I finished it, I realized that it was just enough. I got it with ground pork. Really great flavor! I didn't leave a single morsel on the plate. The egg on top was perfectly done too.
This place is on my list if I ever come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Have been to a lot of Thai restaurants through the years, and this one rates as one of the best. The fried rice has that well seasoned wok flavor. The green curry was rich and deep in flavor. The only thing that disappointed was that they don't have a fresh spring roll option. Don't miss this restaurant if you're only here for a few days!"}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving this place a three or a four star, but i think I'm going to go with four. The food here is good. Like, really good. Apparently the previous chef from Khao San Road is here cookin' up a storm with even more authentic Thai selections. The place is also decorated with detail as well, feeling like you've walked onto an Asian island - even the bathroom doors are made with panels of wood and wooden bolts. There are seatings with beautiful pillows on the floor, where you have to take off your shoes. 

But the place is busy. We went at around 7 to put our name down and waited next door at the bar to be called at around 8. We were seated at one of those floor tables and proceeded to order rather quickly - five dishes for five people: thai green curry that comes in a coconut, pad gra prow with beef (my favourite), pad thai, kha soi, and a thai fried rice with chicken...and at 9 pm, almost an hour after we ordered our food, they arrived. 

I would really like to eat back here again, but my friends who have experienced the exact same timing issue the last time they were there probably would not be too keen on this...so now to con someone else to come with me..."}
{"text":"Always forget to make reservations. 
But food is great, and service is good too.

Definitely recommend the coconut curry in the coconut + Thai iced tea.

{"text":"Heard Pai was branched out from Khao San Road.  Tried it twice - the Khao Soi is my favorite. However the Pad thai was not that special.  I would go to Pai for the Khao Soi and drinks, but Khao San Road for the other stir fried dishes."}
{"text":"I wanted the Tom Yum Nam Sai Kung Mor Fai soup in mild, but the only option was medium spicy. However, I loved it :D The description reads \"A savoury, spicy and sour shrimp soup with lemongrass, coriander and green onions. Served with jasmine rice\" It has a delicious sweet, sour, and spicy taste. The shrimp was perfect, and I liked the mushrooms too. It is served with a bowl of Jasmine rice, and I like that you can ask for more rice. If it's too spicy for you, they provide you with a big jug of water which should be enough for the whole meal.
Reasonable price, good portions, good service."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my most favourite places to come to for Thai food. I usually get the green curry and the squash fritters which are to die for. I promise that you can pick anything on their menu and you will not be disappoint! The only con of this place is the line up. Whether it's a weekday or a weekend, there's always a line up. So plan ahead!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the best Thai food I've ever had. My only regret is that I didn't find this place sooner. I just can't get enough of it! Getting a reservation is tricky, but they're on UberEATS, take advantage of that."}
{"text":"I work on Bay & Adelaide and always come right when it comes to make sure I get a table. The lines are crazy long but with good reason. Everything is so yummy. I have basically tried everything on the menu and have never been disappointed with my order. 

I just wish I could order the crispy basa fillet on it's own! It's so nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Ahhh one of my favourite Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto! If you're a huge fan of those traditional, flavourful and wonderfully spicy Thai dishes, then this is the place for you. 

Service & Environment
The restaurant is very spacious with ample seating area - they also have a very cute traditional seating area! This place has a casual, relaxed atmosphere with their dimmed lighting and trendy decor. My friend and I came on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no wait time. Like any other restaurant downtown, there isn't free parking space available. You would have to pay around 10-20 bucks to park in one of the parking lots nearby. 

Food
Khao Soi - One of my favourite Thai dishes and this place killed it. Broth was very light and not too creamy and heavy. I thoroughly really enjoyed this dish!

Pad Thai - Very flavourful and perfect amount of sauce. Ratio of noodles to vegetables and meat was also perfect. 

Mango Sticky Rice - I remember trying this last summer and was quite content about it! It was delicous."}
{"text":"One of the best parts of traveling is trying different food and restaurants. Even better when yelp help you discover a gem like This!

We went on a Sunday afternoon, be prepared to wait or make reservations in advance. There was a line just to get to the host and jot down you name and how many in your party. They have a market area that does not have an alcohol license but you my get seated faster. We didn't mind not drinking alcohol so went that route, we were seated there within 5 minutes. 

It was a rainy chilly day so I went with hot Jasmine Tea. It came in a cute pot with enough for several servings. For dinner I got the Gaeng Hunglay with Oxtail. I honestly had no idea what it was and was hesitant because I am not a fan of sweet and sour but I LOVE oxtail. When ever I see it on a menu I tend to choose it. I am glad I did! This has been one of my favorite dishes at a restaurant. The curry had just the right amount of heat, nice kick of flavor but did not have you sniffling. Mixing the rice in with the oxtail and sauce was a perfect balance of flavors. Meal left me full and happy!

I would definitely come back here if I ever visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Stop looking and eat here. Well worth the wait, I love Thai food, but I feel like this is the first real Thai I have ever had. I had beef brisket in golden curry, simply amazing. My wife had green curry served in a coconut. She ordered \"foreigner-spicy\", which I thought was quite mild. Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch  I had the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with tofu and veggies and had it at their Thai spicy level (max) I was super pleased with this meal because it was both delicious and my kind of spicy (where you're panting/nose is runny). The meal was $15 plus tax which was a little high so when I come next time, it'll be for dinner to help me justify it.

I wasn't able to finish it all since I had dumplings earlier. But I would have devoured it otherwise!

Service was good."}
{"text":"Super jam-packed excitable lunch crowd on a sunny Thursday afternoon. Our table for 5 got in ten minutes before 12 and in a blink of an eye there was only bar-seating left and the basement volume was kickin'.

I ordered the shrimp pad thai and was fully satisfied that the noodles didn't stick to each other and the sauce was more sweet than savoury compared to what I expected from the dish.

A fellow diner ordered the panang beef curry and I think I liked that dish even more than my own just from a little taste.

Don't come here for a quiet date, it ain't the right mood for that sort of thing."}
{"text":"When visiting a city for the first time, I usually like to have cuisine that is native to the place I'm visiting for the first and last meals of the stay. However, Toronto is one of those places where anything ethnic could be considered \"homegrown\", and so Pai was where I went first. I stopped here shortly after it opened on Good Friday, just glad to find someplace other than a nice person's kitchen to eat at, given that most restaraunts had signs reading, \"SEE YOU NEXT WEEK!\" Really, for Easter?  I digress. Pai was busy and by the time I left, was getting crowded. I ordered the Pad Grow Pa w/ shrimp. So good!!The flavors were OohWee and the spice level was spot on, with just enough kick, but sparing the linings of my cheeks. My only awould be the portion size in relation to the price. In the U.S., that dish would easily be $3-5 less. Nonetheless, if it didn't involve crossing the border to visit here, I'd definitely be a regular on those days that I felt like splurging. 5 stars for food and service, minus one for value."}
{"text":"Usually a long wait to get in, but the food is always great. The pad Thai is a big portion, so consider sharing and ordering another main to share if you want variety."}
{"text":"hmm I think Pai has improved over the years.

I actually wasn't a huge fan of the pad gra prow, pad Thai or Chiang Mai noodles here before, but from my recent visit, the food was better than I remembered.

Sangria is nice and sweet here. Service is cool too. 

Loved the pad gra prow this time, but I wouldn't get it with the crispy pork next time because it was a bit hard."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I love it! The food is amazing with the spices and other flavours just perfectly complimenting each other. There is always a line up, so get in early or ever better book! For a table for 4 on a Friday night, we had to wait for a hour but we just went to another bar for drinks until they sms'd us that the table is ready. 

The curries are a must try - chicken breast curry with noodles - get on it! Paired with a lychee drink, just ends a hot night into a pleasant and relaxing night out."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant.  Like the other reviews, this is an authentic northern Thai restaurant with a cool vibe and a long line-up out the door, so I highly recommend making a reservation.

The other Yelp reviewers are right, the best dishes are Gaeng Masaman Beef and Khao Soi Curry.  I ordered the Masaman Beef and sampled the Khao Soi and they were both very tasty and good portion sizes.

This restaurant is a little cramped and the seating is not super comfortable but the food is delicious.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I ordered a Khoi Soi with beef and every bite was delicious and very flavourful. I had their coconut breaded shrimp as an appetizer and it was worth it. Super crispy and very tasteful. The Thai ice tea is a must try as well! Super refreshing and taste so good! 

The staff was super friendly and very quick service for the amount of people around lunch time. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:30am for lunch on a friday and it was already almost full. We got a table and quick friendly service. Food was delicious.  I tasted the signature curry, green curry chicken, pad Thai and chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Pai was huge compared to Khao San road. Not that they're the same but I find the Khao soi tastier at Pai. But the Thai ice tea at Khao San road is better.  This place is bigger and not as hot as Khao San road so sitting was more comfortable on a hot day."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai place I have ever been.  The beef noodle soup is amazing.  The stage is a little uncomfortable,  but it will take time to adjust.  Makes a good bed though."}
{"text":"We got chef nuit pad Thai with tofu, gaeng klaw wan green curry in a coconut and khao soi with shrimp all with a medium spice - was the perfect amount of spicy. Everything was rich and delicious. At the end we could not decide which dish was our favorite."}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to spot for us.

They are celiac safe and also have vegan options. The food is great and also priced well for what you get. Good quality and taste and service has always been really good."}
{"text":"Super tasty, has definitely taken over my past favourites of Khao San Road or Sabai Sabai. Suhko Thai is the only other restaurant that compares in taste. 

It's super busy all the time, but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Pai is one of my favorite restaurant. I went there for my birthday and I love the decoration there. Good for groups! Their Tom Yum Kung is a must-try item! It surprises me with their flavor coz its acidic taste really embraces my appetite! I cannot stop eating it! Definitely go again. Tips - make reservation! Or go earlier because this place is super crowded."}
{"text":"The food was good. But I have to say the food serving was tooooo SLOW!! 15 minutes waiting to be seated+ Sitting there for 40 minutes waiting for just 1 order. When I complained, the boss even didn't say sorry for the waiting or something else. Will never go back again waiting that long for a super slow serving and bad attitude."}
{"text":"I went there Dec 23rd this past year, roommate and I got food poisoned. He felt funky for a day, I was sick for two days during christmas eve. I was bed-ridden and shitting myself and in immense pain. I will never go there again. Had their soup and masamung curry."}
{"text":"Yum! This place rocks your socks! Excellent Thai food. They recently opened and have a small patio with a downstairs venue. Pro tip: there's a secret group room on the left when you go in. Pretty amazing with their  khao soi curry with egg noodles. However, in comparison to Suko Thai, their portions are a bit smaller in terms of both noodles and chicken. I prefer Suko Thai to this place for this particular dish. But their pork kabobs were heavenly! I could eat a million of them! Come here before it gets \"popular\"."}
{"text":"Amazing flavours. Bustling environment. Excellent service. 

My belly left happy after a great dinner and the restaurant ambience was just the cherry on top. This place is loud, dimly lit, and very trendy. The typical wait is around 15-20 minutes during peak hours though that isn't that long compared to other restaurants. 

Gai Satay ($12.50) 5 Marinated Grilled Chicken Skewers - Served with a nice peanut sauce and tangy cucumber/garlic/lime/chili sauce on the side, these skewers were such a flavourful and tender app. 

Chef Nuit Pad Thai ($15.50) - This is THE staple dish at any Thai restaurant though Pai does it well. Stuck on what to order? Get this. The rice noodles had the perfect texture and wasn't too mushy plus it had a good amount of protein in it. My only complaint is that I could've devoured a bigger plate for the price.  

Khao Pad Thamada ($14) Fried Rice w/ Egg, Green Onion, your choice of protein - So delish! The rice was so fragrant and not bland whatsoever. If you like garlic, tangy, and sweet - this is the dish for you. It's served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili, and lime) which you can choose to drizzle on yourself. 

Tip: One main is a good size per person so don't expect to get full if you share one dish with a buddy. Their portions are just the right amount per person."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, its my Top Pick for Toronto.
Food is sooo good - can not describe it with words, you need to try it!
We went there for lunch, there was a huge line and wait was approximately 20-25 minutes. My daughter loves loud music so she enjoyed waiting in a cute waiting area. Guys if you have a stroller, do not bring it - because it is basically walk down the stairs type of place. Interior is decorated in modern way. Nice staff, even if there is long wait the food and cocktails are out in no time!
I ordered Green Coconut Curry and sangria, oh my goodness it was beyond good! :)"}
{"text":"If you like KSR, you will like this place. The food tastes exactly the same, not sure if that's what they were going for. Server we had for the night was polite, but MIA for the majority of the night and forgetful at times. The oxtail is really tasty, if you come hungry enough, get an extra bowl of rice for all the sauce you'll have leftover and not want to waste. For 2 ppl sharing the dish, you'll start to feel it weighing you down after a bit."}
{"text":"Love the layout and feel of this place, it was very charming basement restaurant.

Some of our faves:
-Tom yum soup, served 4 just fine. We ordered medium but it was pretty spicy for a medium. Good shrimp and veggies in the soup
-Chicken pad thai - nice and large portion, not clumpy or greasy at all
-Grabong, piles and piles of fried squash goodness - with a tasty tamarind sauce. Server recommended this as it was their most popular app

Service was great! We highly recommend this place for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place!! It felt like my last visit to Thailand. The food was great and the atmosphere was as well."}
{"text":"Perhaps the the many 5-star reviews caused me to have unrealistic expectations. I found it to be relatively ordinary Thai food that did not strike me as particularly fresh, exceptionally high quality, or inventive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite authentic Thai restaurant, excellent customer service. You have to try the entree oxtail and the khoa soi, and appetizer wings and garlic shrimp."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite Thai restaurant. I'm from Chicago and have tried Thai places all over the United States-- nothing compares to this! I got the chicken green curry and Thai iced tea. The chicken green curry is a bit spicy and may be too spicy for those who can't tolerate it. For those we can tolerate spice, it's a nice kick! Will definitely be coming back as much as I can!!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch as this is usually my go to for Thai dishes, the food never seizes to disappoint and service is always quick and friendly. We ordered the classic beef pad thai with the green curry in the coconut. Presentation was splendid, but food was even better! Definitely worth the drive downtown"}
{"text":"Came for famous pad Thai at $16.

Sauce was a bit too sweet but portions generous. Packed even in mid-afternoon 

Tom Kang soup packed with veggies and shrimps"}
{"text":"Awesome green curry \"best ever\" & the Ox Tail is a must try!   Service was very helpful, all that was recommended on the menu was a hit for our group of six.  Great vibe and fun setting!"}
{"text":"Pai is a great restaurant for thai food. I particularly enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant - taking you out of the urban jungle of Toronto into a more quaint restaurant with small tables and a multitude of ornaments throughout the restaurant. I've had the panang curry and the pineapple fried rice, both of which were outstanding in terms of flavour and presentation. I would recommend this to friends. I have been meaning to go back, but they are often closed, and when they are open, there is often a line."}
{"text":"Tomyam Soup is served in cold and frozen shrimp is not warm yet in the soup. It's a bar style restaurant and doesn't give any ambience of Thai."}
{"text":"After hearing everyone rave about this place as the Khao San Road but with a shorter line, I finally agreed to go along with some friends one night. Since then, I've been back a few times but its still not one of my go-to spots in Toronto. In fairness, I'm not huge on Thai food but I thought the pad thai was reasonably good, but nothing mind blowing or particularly unique in my opinion. I'm happy to join friends here when they choose the place as the food is always solid, service is consistent and the restaurant has a nice, overly casual vibe. If you really need a Thai food fix I would come here over Khao San Road purely to avoid the lineups."}
{"text":"I usually go to Pai for lunch during weekdays with my collegues.It is always very crowded and sometimes the wait is a bit too long.However,they take you phone number and message you once your turn comes up..

I am a big fan of their Khao Soi with chicken breast.The quantity is a lot and I usually have to take it to go.All other dishes I have tried in their menu has been equally good.
If you are going for Appetizers,do try their spring rolls,they are THEE BEST.

It is my go to place when I am craving Thai food and I am never disappointed.
However,I am not a big fan of their seating arrangement.The tables are very close to each other and the chairs are not very comfortable but I guess that is their theme."}
{"text":"This American fell in love with Canada during her work trip! Such a diverse city with diverse flavors, such as Thai! This restaurant was recommended by a food blogger friend based in Toronto and her review to me was accurate! I went for lunch after working hard at an event and it certainly hit the spot! It was crowded for lunch so you know it's a popular joint! 

We wanted the traditional seating to get the entire experience. Must say our legs cramped up after a while but at least we experienced it!! 

I tried various versions of pad Thai and all were very flavorful. 

I recommend ordering tea on a cold day. The shared pot of green tea sure did warm these Floridians up!

The location is very close to CN Tower and Union Station, so easy to walk to. Not so easy to Uber to with the construction right now."}
{"text":"I have a big crush on Pai, and I can safely say it's my new Thai fave in Toronto. The first time I came here with 2 guy friends and we literally ordered 75% of the menu (2 of us had just run a marathon, so can you really blame us??). The servers were super helpful with their descriptions and recommendations. 

Some of the dishes I've tried:
- Moo Ping (grilled pork skewers) - pork was super tender 
- Sai Au Platter (big platter of pork belly sausage, sticky rice and diff fragrances that you mix together) - would have liked more sauce to it, but it's really different than anything else I've tried!
- Chef Nuit Pad Thai - pretty good from what I remember 
- Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup - the broth is quite spicy and bold in flavour 
- Green curry in coconut - delicious, it was my fave, and loved the novelty of the coconut!!
- Crispy Basa Fillet - loved the 2 dipping sauces, a nice alternative to the usual beef, chicken, shrimp 

Only dessert was Mango sticky rice, which was OK. The 2nd time I went, they ran out of this. Would have liked to see more of a dessert selection. But probably not a huge drawback. I think I'd probably be too full for dessert most times I come here. 

I also love the fact that you can make reservations. I know part of the hype of going to certain non-reservation restaurants is that you get to wait for your food, and it's fair for everyone. Call me Type A, but I like to plan my day and my meals, so reservations work for me. 

Random side note: If you spend enough time in their washroom, you might actually learn a few Thai phrases! (There's a 'learn to speak Thai' soundtrack on loop, so random, but adds to the whimsy)"}
{"text":"First time we arrived, the wait was 40 minutes so we came back another day and the wait was only 5 minutes. I suggest to make a reservation online on their website but they do not accept same day reservations. They also have the option of takeout as well. After seeing all the Yelp reviews, I decided to try it while in Toronto. We tried the fried buttersquash appetizer that we were told was popular. It was quite filling and we were not able to finish it. It came with a dipping sauce that was sweet and it was very tasty. The main dishes we got were the khao soi with braised beef and the green curry served in a coconut. The khao soi was a favorite and the best dish. I've been to many Thai restaurants and would say that this dish was new to me and we'll worth it. However the green curry in a coconut wasn't anything special but the idea of serving it in a coconut was neat. You could carve the coconut meat and eat it with the curry inside."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome.  Green curry. Grabong. Spring rolls.  Khao Sol with braised beef.  Order it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Thai food with great flavours, you have to check this place out! The chef from Khao San Road branched out and started up Paid. It's bigger than Khao San (so your chances of getting a table at lunch is increased exponentially). We got a table for 1:00 on a Friday for 7 people, only because someone knows the manager, otherwise, be ready to wait 10-30 minutes for a table.

I had the khao soi (egg noodles in golden curry, with a choice of braised beef, chicken breast or drumstick). The flavour and spices were great! The crispy noodle gave it a nice crunch, just wished there was more of it! As the whole dish was in the curry, I felt it was too much. They should separate the noodles from the curry. The Thai iced tea was great (similar to the Hong Kong style tea) - sweet, milky, lots of ice.

If you're in the mood for Thai food and are in the entertainment district, check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I love Pai. I've only been to the restaurant once but have done takeout/delivery with Uber Eats several times. They are incredibly busy (we waited an hour for a table) and the restaurant is quite loud, but it's what I'd expected. The servers and hostess did their best to accommodate us despite the huge crowd, which was much appreciated. I liked the fact that they sent you a text when a table became available. 

I have tried the golden curry with braised beef (which I found to be a little too sweet for my taste, but the beef itself was awesome), the Pad Thai, and the Pad Gra Prow, the latter of which I keep ordering. It is SO good. I do recommend that if you don't have a high tolerance to spice, stick to the mild-medium heat levels. 

If I were to go back to the restaurant to dine in, I would probably try during the day instead. They are just so crazy busy for dinner hours, right up until close. Can't give them a lower star rating just because they get a lot of customers though, it isn't their fault the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not big into Thai food so Chicken Pad Thai is my go to option at any Thai restaurant. The Pad Thai here was good but took a while to come out. The noodles were also softer than I'm used to but the flavour was delicious, and the portions will fill you right up. 

My friend got the curry which came in a coconut bowl which was pretty interesting. I'll be sure to get that next time!"}
{"text":"OVERRATED!

After a broken queue system (where I saw numerous people cut because there's no clear answer as to where the line starts or begins) and a long wait, we sat and began with some drinks: a thai iced tea (good flavor, not too sweet) and PAI Sangaria (quite tasty but maybe a little pricey for what you're getting unless you order the pitcher). 

We ended up going with grabong which was interesting and pretty addicting. It was a pretty large portion for two people but we ended up finishing most of it before our other two dishes came. We followed up with the khao soi with braised beef. We both found it very similar to your typical curry but maybe slightly thicker. We went with the medium because my girlfriend doesn't do that well with super spicy but it was essentially mild. Looking back, we should have went a little hotter. The beef itself was quite boring and and tough in terms of texture.  Next came the pad gra prow with crispy pork. The texture of the rice was off; dry and cold, borderline stale. I didn't find the flavor and style of the crispy pork to be too different from Hong Kong style roast pig which you could get for a lot cheaper elsewhere. 

All in all, I didn't the experience at Pai to be a \"bring me back to Thailand\" experience. Perhaps it is because I have been spoiled with a plethora of authentic thai restaurants in Los Angeles. To be fair, if Pai was in Philadelphia, I'd probably go more often. If it was in LA, I don't think I'd go as much as I'd go to Night + Market."}
{"text":"Damn this is becoming one of my FAV Thai restaurants in the city!

I love the atmosphere filled with all sorts of good vibe quotes and pictures of Bob Marley, vacation photos, and all sorts of other decor that creates a chilled out yet happening spot. It is best to make reservations here as it seems to be quite busy any day of the week.

The service can be hit or miss, but it's usually been a great experience for me.  

I've tried the pad thai, the beef khao soi, green curry and fried chicken wings and all really lived up to the hype.  The khao soi was especially delicious with the perfect flavouring and tender beef.

This is a must go-to spot for anyone who loves Thai food."}
{"text":"Had the spring roll and pad Thai. A little pricey but delicious. The restaurant is bigger than expected. Have a fun looking drink menu. My only complaint is some genius brought a screaming baby which slightly dampened my dining experience."}
{"text":"Really good food in a cool divey bar off of Adelaide. My girlfriend and I during a weekend getaway to Toronto were in the mood for Tai and found Pai. When you walk down the steps you will be greeted by classic rock, savory smells and a smiling staff. For appetizers the spring rolls were fantastic and the Chicken Pad Thai did not disappoint either! For those who like their food hot, the Farang Spicy was not very spicy so if you enjoy the heat give the Phet Mak Mak (the spiciest) a shot. All in all, four hours after walking out Pai had us wanting more!"}
{"text":"Stepping inside Pai Northern Thai Kitchen transfers me back to Northern Thailand where the food is spicy and flavoured, people is friendly and nice, and the weather is hot and hotter....

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is a heavenly place for me.

We were luckily to arrive at around 11:30 when it opened on a weekday and right before the lunch crowd came in. Make a reservation if you have a big group, you won't regret that. For singles, there is always the bar area if you just want a quick meal.

Lunch menu is limited but includes most of my favourite items. My NYC guest wanted to try everything........ and of course being a wonderful host, I let her go crazy a little.

We ended up sharing:

Papaya Salad with Dried Shrimp ($10)
Chef Nuit's Pad Thai with Chicken ($12)
Pad Gra Prow with Egg ($12)
Mango Pandan Sticky Rice ($8)

Thai Iced Tea ($4.50) for my guest

I should not had used the word \"sharing\" as my guest just have a few mouthful of appetizer and mains and declared them too spicy for her. I was kind of happy to stuck with finishing everything! Aside from the dessert!

Dinner menu has some interesting item which I would love to try. I guess I would be coming back. Again and Again."}
{"text":"Pai is great. Not just great but one of the best places to dine in Toronto in terms of deliciousness. Their authentic pad thai is a must try. The sweet-salty-savoury flavour they have developed surpasses all expectations within the city limits. Their Thai Iced Tea is so complex with flavour. Do not be discouraged with the amount of ice they put inside. Drink it slowly. The flavours change with the ice melting. 

The ambience is always busy and for good reason, the food and service is delicious. Expect a bit of a wait if you're dropping in.

Speaking of the service, once they accidentally made my (now fiancee's) Pad Thai mild when she asked for no spice (she's a lightweight when it comes to Scovilles) and they took it back immediately. The owner came out to profusely apologise and also comp'd us 50% of the cost while rushing the order through so we can still eat together. 

The quality of the food and service justifies the price (and it isn't that pricey)."}
{"text":"Not like this place needs any more help from my review, but it really is amazing. The flavours are so rich it's near impossible to stop eating. if you're looking to down a bowl of rice - the broths here will make sure that you do. Sure the wait times are long but they do text you when your table is ready so you can explore the surrounding area without worrying about missing your spot in line. 

Be sure to try the squash fritters appy and their Khao Soi dish (IMO the vegan version is better than the original but they're both spectacular). 

Can't wait to come back to try all their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my buddies and ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with tofu and veggies and really liked it. All of chef Nuit's previous restaurants that she's started up have  served amazing thai food and Pai is obviously no expectation. Service was good and food didn't take too long to come out. Everyone had a good time and liked the food. Would recommend for thai food"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday for lunch, maybe around 11:30/12. They weren't super busy, but had to wait a few minutes for a table. The server said there was a mixup with their delivery and they had a limited menu. We got the Chicken Pad Thai and Khao Soi with Braised Beef. They didn't really have anything else on the menu, which was very disappointing since I wanted to try other things and am from the states. 

Chicken Pad Thai w/ Mild Spice - very good flavor. The chicken in it was good, peanuts were on the side. It was still rather spicy for \"mild spice\". 

Khao Soi w/ Braised Beef - the curry was very good and so were the noodles. The beef was tender, but super lean, so at times seemed a bit tough. I wish there were more noodles. Could've gotten a side of rice to go with the curry. 

Service was pretty slow. Lots of people standing around, but our server seemed to be everywhere but our table. Waited awhile for our order to be taken then he never came back after our food was served. Had to wave a different person over for water and the check. 

Would like to go back sometime to try other things on their menu...that is if there isn't a \"mixup with the delivery order\"."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Toronto. Can't believe it was fully packed during lunch time. Beef curry and Kao Sai were awesome"}
{"text":"While in Toronto for a week visit from the states we managed to hit up this place 2 times! Once sitting at the bar, enjoying the eclectic decor and another time for a late night dinner. Both times we got right in despite it being super busy and no reservation!

We enjoyed the Plum Mule and Old Fashioned as well as the Kung tawt sa-moon prai (fried shrimp), Pad Thai, Panang Curry (get with fish!), and the khao soi with chicken. Everything was truly delicious!"}
{"text":"I was perhaps a bit overzealous at first. I ate at Pai within a couple weeks of it opening  and was maybe factoring in some expected improvement and menu expansion/diversification. 

Neither has materialized and I think things have largely gone downhill. The papaya salad I ordered the first time I ate at Pai was loaded with little salted crabs; the last time I ate there (five days ago), there was one-half of a measly little salted crab in it. Ditto with the pad thai -- I had one a month or two ago with only three shrimp in it.

Aside from the addition of northern thai sausages and a couple rice dishes, the menu hasn't really changed here despite what Chef Nuit initially promised -- no new curries or stir-fried dishes.

Finally, the food isn't nearly spicy enough here, even at the highest spice level.

So I take back everything I said. The food here is still excellent relative to most Thai options in the city, but I remain partial to Khao San Road, which has a wider menu (without hurting quality), higher spice levels and more quality control consistency overall.

Points for actually taking reservations and offering delivery, although the latter is unpredictable -- could be 30 minutes or an hour and a half.

Finally, a plea: Can someone open an Isan Thai place downtown?"}
{"text":"Staying downtown and craving some authentic Thai.  This place is Rico.  The very best.  Tough to get in but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a really interesting little place tucked away on Duncan Street, just north of King St. I came here on a Monday night around 6:30 PM for dinner and was lucky enough to get a table for two. Apparently most people will call beforehand and make a reservation, and the guy at the front told us that usually they don't even take same-day reservations because they get booked full beforehand. Just something to keep in mind.

The place wasn't super super loud, so it made it fine in terms of making conversation. I will say it was quite dim though, so I wasn't really a fan of that. Overall though it's got a pretty cool, laid back vibe, I noticed some colourful paintings hanging at the back. I also thought the service was quite good, since our server was very prompt in terms of taking our order, serving our food, and checking up on us, and she was very friendly and helpful as well when she was explaining the different levels of spiciness we could select for our food.

We split an appetizer, which was Moo Ping (northern Thai sweet grilled pork on a skewer.) It was tasty, but expensive, at $10 for 3 skewers. We also ordered pad thai and a green curry, which came served in a coconut, which I thought was cute! I like how this place let's you to customize the level of spice in your food, since I can't handle spicy foods. Although there is an option for no spice, I ended up getting my pad thai mild, and that was fine for me. We got the curry to be medium, and even though it had a coconut milk base, it was too hot for me.

I quite enjoyed my pad thai, which had a strong peanut flavour too it, but it wasn't too much that it overwhelmed the other flavours in the dish. I'm not really an expert on Thai food, so it's hard for me to rate or compare, but I think it was pretty comparable to Khao San Road. I will say that I quite enjoyed my meal though, and I would like to come back to try some of their drinks as well as some of their more interesting dishes!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food. Always busy though so make reservations or be prepared to wait a bit"}
{"text":"Absolute best Thai food I've had in Toronto, and I've tried a few places. 

The Food: the ingredients always taste fresh and are cooked perfectly. Portion sizes are absolutely perfect - generous but not so big you have to leave food on the plate. Their use of spices is impeccable, balanced and flavourful (and with varying degrees of heat for you to choose) - it truly does not get any better than this.
- Their pad thai is excellent and properly made with the right ingredients (tamarind, pickled radish, etc - not ketchup or hot sauce).
- Their curries are the best I've ever had in my life - the green curry with fish is light and refreshing; the panang beef curry is creamy and rich. Even the accompanying plain steamed rice is tasty. 
- Their salads are a lighter summer option, consisting of stir-fried ground meat with spices, served with steamed rice, that you can make into little burritos with the giant lettuce leaves.

The Ambiance/Service: Very neat little basement-type restaurant, amazing relaxing decor, with wooden tables and fun colourful decorations. It transports you to another place - you could easily be on a tropical island rather than in the downtown core. The service has been consistently good, their servers being generally helpful with respect to the food. 

Pai is in a league of its own in terms of good Toronto restaurants. A must-try that I recommend to anyone in the city, either living here or passing through. Usually a busy spot, and for good reason - it is well worth the wait, and that is saying a lot when an hour of most people's time in the Toronto core does not come cheap."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. Delicious and fresh! A small menu that offers a good variety! We ordered the pad Thai, papaya salad, and beef panang. Service was a bit slow at times but otherwise an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Overall, great food, chilled atmosphere with casual authentic vibe, and reasonably priced.

With former Kho San Road roots, you can feel the similarities in the food and menu. Which, I should mention there is nothing wrong with. 

Beef salad, squash fritters, coconut green curry were all highlights.

Restaurant was large and spacious, which was a nice change to Kho San.

What was lacking??? The service was mediocre at best. I am willing to chalk this up to being opened recently and perhaps stiil getting there feet wet. They just seemed a bit under staffed and everything was pretty slow. Good thing I was in a slow moving kind of mood!"}
{"text":"Remains to be one of my top 5 picks in Toronto. Yet to have thai food in the city that can beat the standard this place set in my taste buds. I waited 1.5 hours to get a seat in the restaurant and I'd do that again to have their thai level spiced - pad gra prow!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegan options. Very friendly and helpful staff. Cool atmosphere. Will definitely go back when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Thai food can be really spicy so watch out!

Moo Ping (pork skewers) were really tasty.

The Pad Gra Prow was average. I asked for spicy and it was really spicy! It tasted better as the meal progressed though."}
{"text":"Located on a small street, you might miss it as it's dark and located in the basement.  It was a packed night, but they had the reservation set up for 18 customers. The table was high and so the chairs that were provided didn't have a back support, let alone a place to hang your jacket/coat!! Many of the guest just sat on their jacket. Not convenient at all. There were hangers, but not close to our table. 

Compared to other Thai places, this place is dark and the interior design is a mix match of a carnival scene and a night market scene from Asia. 

Happy:  The veggie spring roll came out quickly and it was hot. I would have preferred a different sauce than the typical one. My main chicken curry dish came in a real coconut which was a nice appeal. (It stated in the menu.) 

Not happy:  However, it was not hot nor warm either!! I was disappointed indeed. It felt like the dish was just left there for the waiter to find. At least the jasmine rice was warm. There weren't a lot of chicken pieces, just a lot of curry sauce!! My partner suggested I say something but I was already too hungry past 9 pm. He ordered pad Thai and he said that he had it better at other restaurants. 

Verdict: I wouldn't go back. I like my food hot (in temperature) and if the cooks are not cooking it right, then there's no point in eating out. It certainly destroyed my experience! At least the service is decent."}
{"text":"Came in 5 minutes late to a reservation... guests came 10 minutes late. Host was super accommodating and extremely polite, and let us know that although our table wasn't ready they were preparing another one, and the wait was minimal. A group of three rather rude men came in talking about how the wait was ridiculous, which the host also handled with grace. A+ for the employees here! I knew that a birthday cake would cost $1 extra per person but they also reiterated that which was nice, since they didn't wait until charging to mention it.

Also, the food is incredible! Hands down best Thai place in Toronto, the dessert is very worth it. Coconut mango rice, mmmm."}
{"text":"Good vibe (it's basically a basement so it gets quite loud) and good food. Service is attentive but the food is very slow. Would not recommend if you are in any type of hurry. 

Tea Ross is an excellent beverage, as is the base Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Not always easy to get a table - Torontonians are in the know now of the best Thai in the city. My lady and I visited northern Thailand in 2012 and fell in love with the cuisine. Much different than the southern classics - green/red curry, pad Thai etc - the northern food was rich, complex and comforting. In the town of Pai, we relaxed by the river, ate amazing food and motorcycled around the countryside. The night market there was our favourite in the country. The Pai locals were so welcoming - I recall ending up partying at a local wedding with a family we happened to meet - and the owners of Pai (Toronto) brought that familiar humble, generous culture across the pond. 

If you want a short review, here goes: The food is Spectacular.  


We have been to Pai (the restaurant) twice now. Once as a couple - and again as a group of 8. The Thai iced tea - orange in colour - with condensed milk - brought me back to the streets of Chiang mai. The Holy Basil they cooked the Pad Gra Pow with is imported from Thailand. I hope to grow some this summer at home. Make sure to try the crispy pork version of this - it was next level awesome. 

The sai ua sausage - amazing flavours and glad to see the lemongrass doesn't overpower everything - these guys know what they're doing. 

The khao soi was so filling but perfect. Authentic creamy texture with a great spice mix. Classic Thai comfort food with some great crunch. Same can be said for the massaman - perfect for a winters night - but the potato and beef might be too much for a summer meal. Laap salad is a must try for anyone who misses the flavourful sticky rice of northern Thailand. As a group - we started with the Grabong - which was great to share. 

Get down here - and wait an hour if there are no tables. Maybe you'll see Michael fassbender. Or the girl from step up (people are flocking from far and wide to sample this amazing food) Or maybe I'll be there! But the food and ambience will Captivate. Enormous cavern of a restaurant - it just keeps going! So tables come up quick. Enjoy :) KAP"}
{"text":"This is the TOP restaurant i would recommend to anyone in Toronto. Every single thing we ordered was delicious and the atmosphere was great! We tried the pad gra pow, green curry, pad thai, and the sticky mango rice. We already want to go back and try the rest of the foods on the menu that we didn't get to try!"}
{"text":"AMBIANCE:
eclectic, relaxed but trendy
classic rock/funk music

SERVICE:
The service at PAI was fantastic. Even though there was a wait, I was seated within minutes. My server was very friendly and at no point did I need to call him over or get his attention, simply because he was so attentive. He knew the menu and even the drink menu well.

FOOD:

Gai Satay
Perfectly cooked chicken, a decent portion size for an appetizer. The peanut sauce was good, although I wish it had a little more kick to it. 4/5

Pad Thai
This is PAI's signature dish. I ordered it \"farang spicy\" which is just above medium and means \"foreigner spicy\". The heat was a bit much for me but the flavour of the pad thai was still good. I wouldn't say this is the greatest pad thai I've ever had just because like the peanut sauce, it needed a little more flavour, but overall still very good. Portion size wasn't massive but definitely satisfying. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Pai has one of the best Pad Thai I've ever had (no ketchup was used). It's crunchy and flavourful. I really like the ambiance and the music they play. Always crowded but with very good reason. 

The service is always quick at lunch time and my plate is always empty within five minutes of the server putting it on the table."}
{"text":"I went here last week and they had only been open (a soft opening) for just a few weeks. They didn't have their liquor license ready yet, but that was just fine as I was really impressed with their food. The water carafes at the table made a bird chirping sound when you pour it which we thought was cute.

Walking into the restaurant, I was a caught a little off guard as it didn't really look like a Thai restaurant. It had a very casual vibe to it with lots of wood paneling and travel knick knacks everywhere, not all of it Thai. It was almost like a mix of Tex Mex meets Tiki bar, but there was a table for six near the front that was elevated with a low table with floor cushions. My group wanted to be seated there as it would be cool to eat while sitting on the floor, but there was too many of us.

The waitor was excellent as he did an excellent job describing the dishes, which had some kind of story or meaning as they were dishes that the husband and wife chef served or created from their homeland and one dish was almost a love story between the two. It was great to hear that the dishes are prepared with love and soul, and it tasted just as good.

I ordered the green coconut curry with basa fish which was served in a whole coconut. I really love the rich flavours and the lime leaf and other Thai aromatics. You could order any dish with any level of spiciness (5 levels), from no spice to Thai spice. I ordered mine Thai spice as the waitor mentioned that it wouldn't overpower the dish while still getting a good amount of heat that will make you sweat. I thought it wasn't that spicy which was fine as the curry flavor was so good and there is also some homemade Thai chili sauce at the table which you could add yourself.

After our meal we were treated to the mango sticky rice pudding, which was sticky rice with a green hue from the Pandam extract, which gave it a nice almost coconut flavor and scent, and was topped with sliced ripe mangos. I thought it was nice, though a few people in my party had some aversions to rice pudding. Unfortunate for them, but lucky for me! 

Prices were very reasonable and their cocktail menu looked really interesting. It's a great casual unpretentious restaurant with a fun atmosphere.
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant.  We had the squash fritters for appetizer, which were amazing.  For dinner, the beef curry dish was one of the best we've had a Thai restaurants.  The pai Thai was fine, not as good as the curry dish.  The kids had the spring rolls, chicken wings, sticky rice and jasmine rice and all were very good.

The service was very good and the music was great!

Ps.  The iced tea is nestea."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch while visiting Toronto. Pai sells some classic Thai dishes but also has a focus on Northern style Thai food. Prices are on the higher end for average to meager portions; flavor was on point though. Would come back to try more Northern style dishes.

The interior was decorated fairly randomly; it feels like you're in a pirate ship, there are cut outs of NBA players, and some paintings. Service was very friendly.

Ordered:
Pad Gra Prow - ground Pork with white jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. Comes with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime). Was really flavorful, but the portions were fairly light. At the price, I wish it was more substantial."}
{"text":"This review will be shorter than my first two. I came here in May. I came here at 11:30am and beat the lunch rush, which at the time became a line out the door.

Food was delicious. Decor is amazing. Drinks are good. My one issue with this place is that they rush rush rush you out the door. I was doing a business meeting lunch so I didn't appreciate this. 

Normally I value service, comfort higher and being rushed would have resulted in a 1.5 to 2 star loss, but the food was delicious so I can't be too harsh."}
{"text":"Food, drink, atmosphere and service were all top notch.  I ordered the Khao Soi, which I believe is a house special.  I chose the braised beef.  This was one of the best Thai dishes I've ever had.  The beef was tender and tasty.  The curry sauce and noodles were so good that I saved the leftover sauce to put over rice.  And, they have a selection of fun, delicious drinks.  This is NOT really a traditional Thai resturaunt so if that's what you want, go elsewhere.  This is more of a modern Thai place.  It was packed, even on a weeknight with hip young groups and couples.  If this is your scene, this is a terrific place to catch dinner downtown."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner a little while ago, there was about a half hour wait...less than at Khao San Road. The food was definitely worth it! I had a golden curry and it was really good. Service was decent. Will be back. :)

Edit: I've probably been here another 10 times since, it's definitely my favourite Thai place in the downtown core! Green curry is cute, served in a coconut and very flavourful. Pad thai is excellent. Thai tea tastes exactly what it should taste like."}
{"text":"This review is on totally about ice tea. Are you kidding me? Half of the drink is ice. Asked for less ice and the drink was served in a smaller glass. Crazy. This is for nearly $6 drink."}
{"text":"Always great food!! 5 star for the vibe too, music, art, high and low tables, always happy to bring people here especially if they usually order Pad Thai as that is great but also the menu is packed with good options."}
{"text":"Dont be late! The line is huge and the wait time is long! But the food is amazing! We order the grabong for appetizer and green curry in the coconut and pad gra prow for dinner. Both very good! Although I request my green curry to be mild, it was quite spicy. But the rice helped to balance it."}
{"text":"I think I just found my favourite thai spot in Toronto! We got the gai satay to start, which was good but could've used with one more skewer to make it worth it. The chicken wasn't too soft or too chewy- just right, and you get to pick from 2 different dips, both of which were delicious. For the main, I got the green curry and my date got the pad thai. The green curry was phenomenal but I regretted picking the fish over the tried and true chicken. While the fish was fresh, it just doesn't work that well with green curry for me. Back to the green curry though... it was amazing. Just the perfect mix of coconuty sweetness and spiciness (I chose medium spiciness). The pad thai was pretty damn good too if a little less special than the green curry. The only downside to this place is that it gets crazy busy so be sure to make reservations well ahead of time."}
{"text":"We had a really great meal at this downtown Toronto restaurant.  Atmosphere is casual and fun.  The staff was extremely nice and helped us to get in and out of there to make our TIFF.  We had the Khao Soi, a delicious curry noodle dish with a tender brisket.  The sauce was rich and juice.  Also, we had Pad Gra Prow with chicken with an egg on top (definitely compliment the other dish).  Would highly recommend if you want Thai in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really liked the freshness of the food here. While reservations are highly recommended because the place was packed even with reservations the food is definitely worth it. I became huge Thai food fan after going here for friends birthday"}
{"text":"The food here was incredible. We waited 15 minutes at the bar because the restaurant was jam packed.

Would highly recommend and would come back. I'd love to make this my go to Thai place."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times already and it never disappoints! I've tried the spring rolls, pad thai, khai soi, and penang curry... all were delicious. Basically can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the great reviews when I was visiting Toronto. There was a long line to get in (30 mins line to put your name down and another 30 mins to wait for a table after). This place has great vibes. Never thought of mixing Thai food with Jamaican music. The food was great but it was a bit too spicy (we asked for mild)."}
{"text":"We came here with a VERY special guest so perhaps it was the reason we got extra special service but I loved everything about this place! The atmosphere and location itself is romantic, cozy and you feel as though you can relax and be yourself.

We started off with the delicious veggie spring rolls. They were extremely flavourful, crispy and not greasy which I find is usually the case with deep fried spring rolls. The thai chilli sauce was everything and more!

We then got some \"Gaeng Kiaw Wan with shrimp. It's a coconut curry soup which was delicious! I am not a fan of curry but it was delightful, spicy and had great depth and flavour. It's enough to share with three people or if you are a curry lovin' soup fan- just for one!

After we received our main courses. I went with the Khao Pad Thamada with chicken- DELICIOUS. Everything about this dish was fresh, portion size was big and the depth of flavour was out of this world. It was probably my favourite thing that I had all night.

You actually feel as though you are eating home cooked meals at Pai and that their food is made with lots of love and attention.

I'll certainly return to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen :)"}
{"text":"This place is bomb!

I tried the pad Thai, the massamon(idk how to spell it) and green curry.

Service: poor.  My friend asked to change the meat after she ordered it.  The lady was kind of pissed and said she would try.  Not the part I was pissed about.  I was more angry that she never came back with a confirmation about the meat change.  They did end up changing it for us which was nice I guess.

Food:
Masamoon: so damn good.  It's like this tamarind curry that matched really well with the beef.  I tried this dish at khao San road and that was way to sour

Green curry: amazing. Came in this coconut that you could eat.  Was amazing

Pad Thai:  the only dish that was meh still better than most pad Thai's tho

Tom yum soup:  was better than most places at all

Notes:  make reservations, service isn't the greatest, food is awesome"}
{"text":"Food and drink: One of my favourite places for vegetarian spring rolls in the city - the mushrooms add a unique and hearty flavour. Pad thai (tofu & veggie) is good but not as authentic as some other restaurants (like SukhoThai). They also have good beer and drink selections.

Atmosphere: Fun and bustling! Can get quite busy though so be prepared for a wait if you don't have a reso."}
{"text":"Service:
Hostess was quick to address you and your party. The wait was a bit long even on a weekday. But you can walk around the area grab drink and the hostess will call you once your table is ready.

Ambiance:
A nice relax environment with dim lighting. A good place for friends to hang and a good meal.

Food:
If you had ever tried other Thai restaurants in the area like Khao San Road or Sukho Thai, Pai Northern Kitchen is pretty much on par. They have a similar menu as Khao San Road. The Squash Fritters and Khao Soi are must tries!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food hands down!  Definitely one of the best thai food restaurants I have tried. 5 stars for quality of food, the vibe and the authenticity of the ambiance. 

Wait time:Came here on a weekday for an early dinner and still had to wait a good 25 minutes. The line was out the door and only grew longer as the time passed by. Try to make a reservation if possible. They will seat you in a waiting area where you can order drinks as well as appetizers before you are ready to be seated in the dining area.

Appetizers and drinks: Appetizers were some of the most delicious thai food I have ever had. 

Fried coconut shrimp: Quality shrimp that is lightly breaded in panko breadcrumbs and deep fried. When you bite into the shrimp, you can taste a hint of the coconut and other spices. The shrimp is fresh and soft. Definitely recommend this appetizer!

Satay Chicken: The meat is so tender and the peanut sauce that comes with it is not too heavy. Tastes great and I would probably try their chicken wings next time as well. 

Drinks: Ordered a Thai Mojito and a sake. I would probably skip on the mojito next time as it was pretty sugary. Sake pairs well with spicy food.

Main entrees:
The main entrees were also equally impressive. 

Thai (green) curry in Coconut: Really delicious curry and looks great as it is served warmed in a coconut. 

Stir fry ground beef with rice and fried egg: This was probably my favorite dish. Lots of different spices and flavours. Authentic thai food taste--I can't recommend this enough. 

Check this place out! They also sell shrimp chips by the bag for $5 dollars."}
{"text":"Good service + excellent Thai food + comfortable portions + relaxing ambience = happy diner

5/5 would come back again!

Had the basil chicken on jasmine rice... Super authentic and flavourful. Food came relatively quickly too, which made the entire dining experience very enjoyable. 

I'm a definite pai fan!"}
{"text":"From what I understand, Pai is brought to you by some of the same people who launched Khao San Road. I came in here for a late lunch (2:30pm). Craving Thai food, KSR was closed, which made Pai a welcome addition to the neighborhood. At 2:30pm, the restaurant only had a few tables with guests so we had our pick. Although there weren't many patrons, service was slow. When we walked in, there were 3 waiters who passed menus to each other until one of them agreed to seat us.

It took a while to get someone to take our order. I ordered the Thai iced tea and the green curry. It took a long time for the iced tea to be delivered. The iced tea comes with crushed ice, likely because it's super sweet. Granted it's really good, but once you start getting closer to the bottom it gets sweeter. The green curry was very tasty and reminded me of the curry at KSR.

Overall the food is excellent. The service on the other hand could use some work."}
{"text":"Food is great, service just OK! I have been quite a few times and have always liked what I ordered, not a bad thing on the menu from what I can tell. Servers are a bit uninterested, but they do get the job done, so not the end of the world. If you're really into server interaction and personality, maybe not the place for you, but if you are just there for the food then it's a great place to go!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai restaurant that's not super expensive in TO. 

Of my many times here I've gotten the fried rice, the khao soi, the pad Thai, the coconut curry. And the best is probably the fried rice here. Very rich in favour and probably the best fried rice I've ever had. 

They also have a killer sangria but their drinks are more to the pricier end. 

That said, the reason why this is not a 5 stars is because of the long wait that always exists here (30-40min wait) and the loudness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came back again, this time for lunch. Service was good, food was even better.

Green Curry with Shrimp: This dish originally comes with chicken but they were very accommodating when I asked if I could get it with shrimp instead. I'm so glad I got it with the shrimp. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, juicy, and succulent. I don't think I've ever had a more perfectly cooked shrimp. This has been the best green curry I've ever eaten. It is packed full of fragrant and aromatic flavors and is the perfect consistency and richness.

Gaeng Masamun with Braised Beef: Punchy, rich, aromatic, and flavorful. The beef is so tender."}
{"text":"I don't know if my tastes of changed (most likely) or I just didn't get a good one initially because I DO like their Pad Thai now. Previously KSR had the hands-down best but it just didn't taste the same and at least Pai has a lot more protein options. Unfortunately my shrimps were way overcooked (you know how they say shrimp should look like a \"C\" and if they're overcooked they look like an \"O\"? Two of my shrimp looked like curly fries) but the noodles themselves were still great.

My favourite here is either the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle soup (I wish it could be spicier but the tamarind broth tastes great and they give a LOT of beef), or the Fried Fish with Green Curry (make sure to not accidentally order Green Curry Fish; it's cheaper but the fish has no breading and is swimming in the curry rather than being fried and on the side). 

They also have a very consistent spice level (unlike Salad King which either tastes like nothing or tastes like ghost pepper noodles even though I always ask for a 4) and the various food apps really help for take out.

I tried the Pai Market a few times but wasn't too wowed by it; I just stick with the regular menu for now."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We weren't blown away with the foods but this place does serve authentic Thai foods in Thai's true flavors. We arrived here late Friday evening towards 9PM and only had to wait half an hour. There were plenty of workers around to ensure everybody was served in a timely fashion. The restaurant was a bit dark with decor that reminds me of a good night out in an outside bar in Thailand (as if I've ever been to Thailand during my adulthood but I could imagine this). Lots of people dining in and waiting, so the noise level was pretty loud. Great ambiance though. 

The menu doesn't have a wide variety of items in comparison to the Thai restaurants you get back in CA. Which was a bit disappointing since we were craving other items. However. they serve a few key dishes (pad thai, meat with rice, noodles, etc) and they do it very well. We opted for the fried squash fritters, pad thai, and I got the ground pork on top of rice with egg (forgot the name). The fried squash fritters were really good! The batter does have a Thai taste to it and I thoroughly enjoyed indulging myself in its fried goodness. Plus it was huge too, we had some to pack for snack later on. The pad thai tasted authentic and not overly sweet like you would find at other places. My ground pork in basil and spicy sauce on top of rice was okay. It tastes like something my parents could make at a very steep price. I killed that in a handful of bites. I got the foreign hot spice level which was the second spiciest and it had a good burn, but it wasn't spicy enough that I felt uncomfortable. I would get the Thai hot next time! 

I remember seeing $14 to $15 for most dishes which I thought were very steep. The portions weren't hefty and the flavors were standard. Would we come back? Probably not but would recommend this place to others to try."}
{"text":"I have frequented this establishment and I must say I have never been disappointed. I have tried majority of items on the menu and they are all flavourful and unique. I really like the descriptions on the menu because it makes it super easy to bring guests who have any dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten free) which is rare for Thai restaurants. The atmosphere is fun and laid back and I would highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for some amazing Thai food !"}
{"text":"I can understand why people are raving about this place, the food is wonderful, fresh, quick and authentic. You can choose your spice level so there is something for everyone. The price is very fair and average for thai food. It gets very busy so reserve or come in early."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out Pai! Super late review tho, oops. I came by party of 4 on a Sat afternoon to grab lunch. A lot of people told me it gets really busy and it did looked a little packed but wasn't too bad. Lively and upbeat place! Didn't have to wait long maybe like 6 mins. Got seated on one of the high tables on the side near the low cushioned seats. Spacious enough for 4 people. 
I ordered the khao soi and this was good but it was a little on the cool side imo. My friend also said the same for his bowl as well. Was creamy and brothy. They were generous with my chicken protein. 
The pad thai was prob one of the best I've tried. 

I really enjoyed the thai iced tea. I've been craving for one ever since!
As an app to share, we ordered the garbong? Don't know if I spent this right but it's basically squash fritters. Tastes like sweet potato fries to me but this was really good and I would order this again. The sauce that came with it was a perfect match.

I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Very crowded and long lines to be seated. Food was yummy. Panang fish was delicious. Chicken satay and Gabong were tasty as well."}
{"text":"Liked this spot. The decor is pretty cool. I wanted to take pictures of it but felt kind of weird because there were so many people crammed in the tables around us. But not SO tight that we felt like someone was sitting at our table. I had a thai dish from the menu. It was pretty tasty but just thought there were too many vegetables and they were cut way too big (but that's my personal opinion). Oh and I also substituted their chicken for tofu and the tofu was just right!"}
{"text":"If you like Thai food and you're in Toronto, go here.  I don't care how far away you are...you drop everything and go here.  

On the bartender's recommendation I went with the Tiger Shrimp (something I would never choose for myself) and Thai Green Curry with Chicken.  

The shrimp were crunchy and full of flavor - unlike most tempura shrimp.  And the Green Curry...I might have to fly back to TOR JUST to eat it again.  I think I'm in love. 

A little busy at lunch...had to wait 10 min to even get a bar seat but I was by myself, so NBD."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with friends (~4-5ppl) and there is always a wait during dinner time. However the food and service is definitely worth it! 

We keep our orders pretty similar each time we visit because we've come to crave exactly these dishes:
-papaya salad (served on a platter with vermicelli, veggies, fried pork rinds, shrimp crackers and of course the salad itself)
-beef salad (beef is always VERY tender)
-tom yum soup (big bowl, amazing flavour, comes with a mini flame to keep it hot)
-beef pad thai (generous portion, not gooey, just the right spice level at Medium)

What I have to commend Pai on is their exceptional service despite the level of patrons, servers are always around/asking how everything is. Bravo and I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for dinner with a large group. We made reservations ahead of time because our group was over 9 people. When we arrived it was packed at the front and I knew the food would be amazing.

I had the Khao Soi with beef. The presentations was nice with lots of dry crispy noodles poking up from the rich flavoured curry. It was mildly spicy but it was just right for myself. The server was very helpful and made small conversations with us.

Overall a wonderful experience and I definitely will be back to try other dishes. Perhaps I'll try a drink next time too!"}
{"text":"Pai is a great place for lunch on a workday. You'll need to go early if you want to walk in. The food is delicious and the service is pretty good. 

Went here for dinner one time and was a little disappointed. The prices were significantly higher and the quality of the food didn't seem quite as good as the lunch service. Could have been a one off problem though."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Pai. While we originally wanted to sit down but there were no seats available and the wait was extremely long. So, we did takeout!

I ordered the Pad Cha Hett which is a vegan stir-fry containing mushrooms, snow peas, chili paste, and other Thai spices. It was served on a bed of rice. It was extremely delicious with the perfect amount of spice (mind you, I like my food pretty spicy). However, considering the ingredients used, I found it a bit pricey and the person taking our order was quite rude but that's to be expected from a popular and hip restaurant in Toronto. 

I would definitely recommend this place to others. The restaurant has a great fun, young, hipster vibe to it and it's relatively affordable. Will definitely come again and again!"}
{"text":"80% authentic, 20% sugar. Head here if you like food that is really close to Thai food, just with 2-4 extra tablespoons of sugar added in."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Thai places in the city.  Busy place, so can be a bit slow - especially takeout - but food was tasty.  Appetizers a bit smaller than expected."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend, who mentioned the Khao San Road connection (I have never tried Khao San Road before.)  I must admit, I like Thai food, but I don't love it - I have found in the past it is either only OK or terribly made, and I would put Pai in the OK category.  I ordered a Vegetable curry in a coconut, and at best, it was slightly bland, and the vegetables seemed like they came out of the freezer.  However, my friend ordered Pad Thai, and she loved it - so I feel like maybe I ordered the wrong thing??   

I like that they take reservations (apparently their sister restaurants do not) and staff are super friendly.  Decor is also pretty cool  Note: it is very noisy in this restaurant,"}
{"text":"Even though the wait times for dinner are usually quite long, this place never disappoints. It's got great authentic thai food and flavor, plus it's a great place to meet up with friends after work in the entertainment district. Expect to wait for about 30 minutes when you get here during prime dinner time, but I think the wait is worth it. It's quite loud and not very accessible. Over the years, they've downsized some portions (especially the coconut curry, which used to be a large coconut). It's a very trendy and fun place for a date too."}
{"text":"Clearly a place to go if you like Thai food.
Just walked in without reservation and was provided with a time-slot that was incredibly accurate. The place was packed but there was a great atmosphere. The food was delicious and the service friendly and professional.
Price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Pros: friendly service
          Great food! The curry is a must!
          Young, hip atmosphere


Cons: gets very busy and you may have a long wait without reservation after 5:30
         Very loud
         Very cold during winter, if you can, avoid sitting anywhere near the entry door during winter months."}
{"text":"The best Thai Resturant in Toronto. One of my favorite places to go to whenever I'm in Toronto. The atmosphere is great. Service is super fast. You won't regret going there"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!

AMBIENCE
I really like I was like n Thailand.  The place is underground and it was a cool place.  It had ample seating and a sizeable bar for a nice hangout if you were going for drinks. My guests and I sat at the tall tables, group of six.  There's is cell phone charging station, very safe and useful I left my phone charging over dinner.  A nice place to hangout with friends or a date night.

SERVICE
I like the staff, there was cool and took care of us.  We also had a canteen of water and our food always was served hot and fresh.  It was just the way I like it.

FOOD
So gooood!!!  

Starter - grabong = squash fritters;  paired with a tangy sauce.  Not oily and nice and crispy.

Plah Nua - beef salad.  Roasted rice with some lime sauce.  So good!!!

Som Tom Tad - papaya salad.  Perfect citrus levels.

Entree - gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut.  Green curry was served a coconut, it was so good.  Creamy, savoury and perfect balance.  I ate all of the way down to the coconut meat.  So my favourite.

Dessert - mango sticky rice.  It was good not something that really stuck out.  I don't think I would eat.  Just not my preference.

I am looking forward to returning again, soon!"}
{"text":"Pai is delicious! However, the prices are a bit steep. Pad Thai and a Thai Iced Tea was around $22. However, I was really hungry so I thought why not give it a try. They are on the 'feedback' app which offers discounts if you buy ramen at a certain time of the day. Though that app varies from time to time depending on whats available. 

I didn't think it was anything special, but also it was such a long line up to get in. They have a great system where you can leave a phone number and wander around in a bit. 

I think trying pad Thai was not the best choice since it was so common everywhere else. I would definitely go try again and hopefully my experience will be better!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some good food, my friend and I went to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen for dinner last night. Because we arrived late (9:30), we were immediately seated at- still- what appeared to be the only table available, and we quickly placed our drink orders.

Choosing a Singha and a Tom Yum Caesar respectively, we continued with shares of the Moo Ping and the Pad Cha Hett. The pork of the Moo Ping was both tender and flavorful, and the Pad Cha Hett, or a vegan Shimeji mushroom stir fry, was delicious! Prepared with homemade red chili paste, snow peas, bamboo shoots, basil leaves, wild ginger, and peppercorn, and served directly over steamed jasmine rice, it was the perfect main to accompany the pork skewer appetizer.

The service was both friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was hip. Pad Northern Thai Kitchen is an excellent representative of the diverse dining options that Toronto has to offer."}
{"text":"3.5 star for Pai, 

my expectations were high for this place..

what can i say..  food was good.  tastes just like sukhothai and sabai sabai .. because the menu was created by chef nuit.. 

environment was unique.. presentation is nice for some of the dishes like the curry served in a coconut..  they even give you the left over curry that they cant fit into the coconut which was nice."}
{"text":"I loveeeee Pai! It is one of my go-to Thai places in the city. 

My go to order is Gaeng Kiaw Wan, a green curry served in a coconut. They usually give you additional green curry in a bowl because the coconut is so small, but I love scraping the coconut meat and eating it with the curry. Note that if you order take out, the green curry will not come in a coconut. Their grabong (deep fried squash fritters) is also delicious and addictive!

My only complaint is that it is too popular and there are often long waits on Thursday & Fridays evenings and weekends. Get there early or be prepared for a fairly long wait!"}
{"text":"So we went back. This time for dinner. We ordered the chicken wings to start. They were soooooo good!! So we ordered some more! Then for the mains we ordered the (medium spicy) pad gra prow with shrimp which is basically grilled shrimp in a basil and oyster sauce on rice, and the khao plan tawt which is a plate of crispy whitefish filets with rice and a couple sauces. 

The fish dish is similar to the Fried Fish with Green Curry Sauce on the lunch menu. The dinner version comes with a chili sauce and a tamarind sauce while the lunch version comes with a curry sauce.

I loved the wings and the shrimp in basil & oyster sauce! So much so that I'm upgrading this place from 4 stars to 5."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place that i know of in TO.  The competition (Sukhothai, KSR) just doesn't measure up.  There is more balance here in the flavours and the menu and drinks offerings are crowd pleasing -this is a great place to have a casual meal with a group of friends.  OK, the music and noise can get too loud in some parts of the restaurant, but hey, that just lends to its authenticity.  Service is friendly and snappy.  This place can get super busy with long line ups so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Loved the environment at Pai. The signage outside made me wonder if this was more of an upscale place than I was expecting. Inside, I loved the atmosphere and decor. There was a section with floor pillows to sit on, which I imagine was for bigger groups. I decided on having the Jasmine Rice that was fried with an egg, onions and garlic. Lots of Garlic! It was delicious, and the portion size was gigantic. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai and the portion was pretty big too.

The service was good, but our waitress didn't seem very enthusiastic about anything, so that could definitely be better.

Overall, would I go back? Yes. But only if I was in that area and really craved the rice."}
{"text":"I ordered Chang Mai beef noodle \"Thai spicy\" through UberEats and Takeout but they gave me \"Mild(No spice)\" TWICE!!! ! Also, I ordered \"extra chilli oil\" and they forgot TWICE.... I used to love this place so this is very sad and unacceptable. What kind of Thai food is it if there is no spice..I hope they improve their service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night without reservations and waited about 40 minutes for a table for 4; luckily there were ample waiting spots inside so it wasn't too bad. We didn't have a seating preference and so were seated at one corner of the restaurant where you had to take off your shoes and sit on these mats - I only saw 2 tables that offered seating like this so I always thought there'd be a longer wait so it was cool to finally try it out! 

My friends and I ordered the gabrong (squash fritters) to start as it is my biggest recommendation here (and at Khao San Road and Sabai Sabai). It's a mountain of deep fried spaghetti squash with an excellent garlic tamarind sauce. It's good enough to share with 4~5 people although I have devoured this on my own once depending on how hungry you are.

For mains, most of us got the Khao Soi and our other friend got the green curry which was served in a cute little coconut. Portions were quite friendly and all of us struggled to finish our plates. I loved the crispy noodles they put in the Khao Soi, made for a great texture combined with the rice noodles. I do wish they had put some veggies or something in there though, the dish felt kind of plain.. I would also recommend adding some chilli or hot sauce to the dish as well - it wasn't spicy at all and needed a bit of a kick.

Overall, the atmosphere here would remind you of hostels in Thailand so it's a great vibe and casual spot to get together with a group of friends. The place is quite big as well so it'll be easier to get seated. However, just based on my preference, I would rather go to Sabai Sabai (especially for their tapas style dinner) for better food and a more refined atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for quick lunch and dinner, it was right next to my office. One of the best pad Thai in town. Love the food and the atmosphere! If your office is near pai or you love ordering out for lunch, don't miss out on their lunch market place. Great bang for your buck, offers a different special every day. Check out my last picture, I forgot what it was called, it was rolled up rice noodles in a stewed pork belly sauce, a very interesting and good tasting dish to try."}
{"text":"I would definitely be back to try every  dish on their menu . I decided to be safe and tried their pad Thai ( it was great but then I was regretting that I did not try the other dishes ) My husband tried the pad gra prow and my  friend tried the fried fish with green curry . Every ingredient adds to the flavour of the dish .The best part is they let you choose the spice level . They have 5 different spice levels . I decided to go with the farang spicy ( foreigner spicy ) . The place is vibrant and colourful . Ohh !! Did I mention that there always a long wait as it's mostly packed !!!  Well that can be compensated by their delicious food ."}
{"text":"Around: $20/person
Summary: A slight more expensive thai food place, with good service, but OK food.
Wait time: long~
Tips: do not ordered curry as take out during dinner

I know this place is probably a popular joint for thai food. However, I just found it a OK. I like Khan San Road better (moved to a new place now). This place does not give me a \"Wow\" feeling like Khan San Road.
I have been here a couple of times.
I ordered curry to go. For around $40, I got 2 very small box of curry. I knew for sitting down, the curry came in a coconut, however, for to go, it is just in a plastic bowl. Tastes good, but the portion is tiny.
I also been sat down for lunch, ordered curry again. I was expecting a curry in a coconut like dinner time, however, it just came in a metal bowl. I guess they cut down the cost during lunch, and the curry tastes a bit too salty. The thai ice tea is also too too too sweet to drink. I just ended up dilute with water.
Maybe I ordered wrong curry dish, but it takes like average curry I could get at Thai restaurant and a bit expensive as well."}
{"text":"Ahh, the famous Pai! With almost 5 stars and over 1,000 reviews, you can't help but have high expectations. I don't really remember the names of the dishes, but hopefully you can connect two and two. Everything was quality made and the ingredients were fresh. 

Good
- The skewers were excellllent. Never had skewers done that way before. They were moist and tender and the flavour was subtle but very tasty. I would order this again in a heartbeat. 
- The sticky rice that came with each meal was really well done. 
- Beef salad was yummy. The cold salad mixed with the beef was a nice combination and the sauce had a bit of a kick but really complimented the dish.  Portion is not that large considering it's a salad, left with wanting more. 
- Thai milk tea was yummy but very sweet. I liked it but I had to water it down a little as it was very concentrated. 
- Presentation of the dishes felt very authentic and everything looked delicious. 

The Ok
- I ordered the main dish that has ground meat with a fried egg on top on a bed of rice. I was okay with this. Wasn't blown out of the water and it's unfair to compare, but I prefer the Vietnamese style of the rice/meat/egg combination. 
- I think it's my own bias, but I really did not enjoy the sausage appetizer. It was dry and the flavours were peculiar and not what I was used to. 
- We sat outside, but when we were waiting for a table, the interior was quite dark and cramped with tables and people almost touching each other. If you're able to, get on the patio with good weather. It's a great experience! 

All in all, really solid restaurant that gets packed in no time. My brother was sprinting to get the table we wanted and we had to have an early dinner at 5 pm. Shortly after that, the line spilled out into the streets with hungry patrons. Really recommended (but get a reservation). 4/5!"}
{"text":"JUST AWESOMEEE!  Everything from the wings to the spring rolls to the pad thai to the green thai curry, and everything in between was so beyond delicious.  This place is hopping, just packed, at all times of the day, and rightfully so!  The food is definitely something to make the trip and wait for.  I really want to go back tomorrow for another dinner, to be fairly honest!  Always amazing :) ."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times, and have tried the squash fritters (amazing!), classic pad Thai (also great), the green curry (it comes in a coconut and you can eat the coconut meat!), and the Miang Kung (betel leaf wraps, good low carb/paleo option). 

I love coming here with friends but be warned of the long waits (45-60min) during peak times around 7pm."}
{"text":"Holy Cow is this place good! The Thai Iced Tea is fantastic. If you're coming for lunch you should probably arrive before 12 as the line was put the door by 12:10. Not sure if they take reservations or not.... Everything I've tried on the menu has been great"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch due to a Thai food craving. I had the pad Thai and wasn't all that impressed. The noodles didn't seem cooked well enough and everything was kind of a mush. I've had much better elsewhere. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff though!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some friends - was super busy but as usual the food is so good. 

The reason i took off one star is because they have recently raised the prices. Also, we were 3 people seated at a high top table for 4, our server came over and asked if she could take the 4th chair with our bags on it. i get that the place was busy but seeing as there were no hooks on the table my friend and i ended up eating with our purses on our lap, super uncomfortable. the server suggested we put them on the table but id rather not have them up there with the food.

Other than that, i will go back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the squash fritters, beef khao soi, chicken green curry, and beef masaman curry. Great vibe and they have a private room for large groups which is great! However there are always line ups so I recommend going a little earlier than the usual dinner time."}
{"text":"Amazing food! They also got one of those shoes off style tables (which would be nice for parties)

Things to get:
-Thai Sausage Platter 
- Thai Iced Tea
- Curry Oxtail

Will be back for more sampling"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Pai is a bit better than Nana, the food here have a sweeter taste which most Canadian would like. Tried the curry and pad kra pow moo, curry's decent (you can choose your own spiciness) and pad kra pow moo is a bit too salty but still delicious. However, I wouldn't recommend the marinated raw crab, not my type of food.(or maybe I'm just not used to this kind of dish) 
 
Recommend this restaurant to everyone, better book online for a table in advanced otherwise at least one hour waiting is needed."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday for lunch around 12pm and surprisingly had no wait. 

I ordered a Khao Soi with beef and it was marvelous. I visited Chiang Mai back in 2013 and this dish really brings me back to the cuisines there. It's very authentic and one of my favorite dishes I had in Thailand. One thing that I love about this dish is that it has a mix of crunchy and egg noodles. Really changes the texture you feel compared to a typical noodle dish. The beef is quite tender and the golden curry is extremely flavorful. 

The seating here was a bit cramped cause the table was right up against a wooden support. Try to avoid that seat if you can!"}
{"text":"One cloudy afternoon my friend and i decided to hit PAI for a late lunch.  We were put on a waiting list for 15 minutes before being seated.  The restaurant was bustling at 2pm, and i had high hope that this place would be really good since so many people were there.
I ordered Crispy Basa Fillet served with steamed jasmine rice topped with crispy shallots. Served with 2 kinds of sauces.  There were plentiful pieces of fish fillets.  However those fillets were ones you find in the frozen section of grocery stores.  I was expecting real fish.  The 2 dips were good, which somewhat made up for the deep fried frozen fish.  My friend ordered Green Curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk (contains shrimp paste) with beef.  Served with steamed jasmine rice.  The green curry came in a coconut shell which was cute.   The curry itself was delicious with a punch of spiciness, and the beef was tender.  Next time i would definitely order this for myself.
Overall the service was ok.  The server was always around and he was quick to give us the bill.  The atmosphere was lively and jovial.  Nice restaurant to come to for a lazy saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Personally i was excited to try this place out as I love Thai food. I was highly disappointed. First of all the wait here I crazy, and after eating I don't feel it was worth it. 
The green curry in the coconut might have looked good but it was very watery and slightly cold. The food overall could have had a lot more flavor. This is a great place if you are not to pushed about food and want somewhere with a great ambiance but if you want good Thai food there are many locations in Toronto I would go to before Pai. 
I do have to admit that the staff and service was very good, it's just the food that was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Probably hands down the best Thai place - and definitely my go to, if you don't mind the noise during peak hours.

I've been a couple times during off-peak hours, and it was definitely a lot quieter.

For a first time customer, the squash fritters are a must - I seriously regretted it after opting for another appetizer during my first visit!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Toronto downtown i really liked the food very well balanced in test and very cozy and the staff very friendly"}
{"text":"This place is a treat! I've tried sabai sabai and khao San road, both are good but nothing wow me like this place does. Pad Thai was a bit salty but authentic. Unlike other Thai restaurants, they use the real deal \" Tamarind sauce\" and not Ketchup.
 The most enjoyable dish was the pork belly. You can easily devour 2 bowls of rice with the pork belly- thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place gets super packed! Make sure to make reservations. I love their garbong, pad Thai, and of course their Khao soi. The vibe is loud and dark, sort of hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had. My parents recently went to Thailand and while she was visiting me in Toronto I took her to Pai and she loved the food too. The decor is simple and their's nothing fancy about the presentation but the food is soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"New favorite Thai place and I'm originally from Thailand! I used to go to Khao San road but come here now because 1) takes reservations (I hosted my birthday party there for 15 ppl and they have a private section in the back and they work with you to figure out the menu and service was great) and 2) the food is better! The pad Thai here was surprising great compared to Khao sarn road and my cousin who just came from Thailand approved. Same for the som tum with salted crabs like that's one of my favorite street thai dishes but the problem with eating it in Thailand is the crabs might have parasites so I don't really eat it there but there's no parasites in these crabs here obviously! They also have sticky rice here and always present the food so wonderfully. Love their pad kraprao too but sometimes too spicy than I can handle bcos I have been in Canada for too long. But still good! Service is pretty good but they're always really busy so it's a tiny bit slow but if you call them they come over. They also host a bunch of parties throughout the year so if I lived in Toronto I would totally go!"}
{"text":"Classic - best thai in Toronto hands down. Prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Great food at this restaurant - one of our favourite Thai places in downtown Toronto! I really like their Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Great, great, great food! Went there with a small baby, they were able to accommodate in the new section. You have to either make reservations in advance (like weeks in advance) or go at 4pm or 5pm. Green curry, massam curry, pad Thai, spring rolls, everything we tried was incredibly delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at in North America! I might even go as far as to say this is the BEST and I've tried Thai food in Thailand. If you're in Toronto, you have to stop here for a meal. 

We ordered the chicken satay, crispy garlic shrimp, grabong (the crispy stringy thing you see in the pictures), and the khao soi braised beef. The flavors were out of this world. The soup in the khao soi was spicy and intense with coconut and Thai flavors. Almost every dish we ordered was phenomenal. The grabong is an awesome appetizer to start because you literally get a big bush of it, and everyone can just start grabbing at little strings and dipping them into the spicy/tangy sauce. 

As others have said in their reviews, the wait time to be seated is very long. But that's not a problem for me. I'd rather wait 45 minutes and eat some of the best food in the world than be rushed to a seat. It shouldn't detract you from coming here either. Just plan ahead. Also long lines are usually a sign of high-quality food, just saying."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Khao Soi beef is classic. The soups are excelent (and a full meal)"}
{"text":"Great food, customer service is typical of the food industry."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 8:30 PM and waited about 20 minutes for a table. We ordered the pad Thai, spring rolls and the green curry. 

Part of the green curry was served in a coconut, which was a nice touch. The coconut itself was tasty and the meat added a nice crunch to the curry. The green curry itself was pretty average and comparable to other good Thai places, nothing outstanding. Spring rolls were also indistinguishable from AYCE buffets. 

The pad Thai was exceptional. Other places taste just sweet - but this place hit all the spots. A real depth of flavour that's often lacking in Americanized pad Thai joints. Only comment is be careful of the spice level. The Thai Spicy level is NO JOKE. Unless you love eating extremely spicy food, be very careful when ordering this!"}
{"text":"Khao soi with braised beef- this is a must have. Comes with egg noodles but I highly recommend ordering side of rice as the soup is so much better eaten with rice.
Chef pad Thai
Always a line but goes fast. Highly recommend reservations"}
{"text":"Been multiple times and the food is amazing. Their new waiting system is definitely more efficient and manages the crowd well. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to in Toronto so far. A must try!"}
{"text":"Great thai place in Toronto.  We started With Tom yum soup which was flavorful and nice.  Went to the coconut curry and shrimp pad thai. Both were very nice.  The downside is how hard it is to get into this place.  We waited 45 min on a Saturday night at 9pm. Was good though or we were starved."}
{"text":"Everything was good. We had the wings and spring rolls for appies. I had the beef masaman and my boyfriend had the pad gra prow, both are top notch. We've been going top those place every week and anything we try is absolutely delicious. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Great atmosphere and even better food. A friend recommended this place to us and we were SO grateful that he did. The Khao Soi might easily be one of the yummiest things I have ever eaten. My boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai which was also delicious but almost boring in comparison. We will be back to try every single other item on the menu, as long as I can tear myself away from the Khao Soi... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
COME EAT HERE! If I could give them 10 stars I would. 
bonus: affordable too and great service!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for authentic Thai street food.

This location gets very busy for supper even on a weekday, but it is large enough to accommodate a lot of patrons.

My fav dishes are:  crispy basa filet (khao pla tawt), Pad thai, butternut fritters (Gra bong)"}
{"text":"Although I prefer Sun in Buffalo, this was a great choice.  Very trendy, busy because I guess word gets around.  My guests and I each ordered a separate entree and shared, based on the waitress' recommendations."}
{"text":"Love!! Pad Thai was out of this world-- best I've had in Toronto :)

Awesome vibe and ambiance, service can be a bit slow but overall still pretty friendly. Had the Pad Thai, and my friends had the Pad Gra Prow and the Khao Pad Thamada. All dishes were great-- no complaints. The drink menu seemed interesting but we all had too much to drink the past few days and decided to stick with water :( 

Excited to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Equally as delicious as it's neighbor Khao San, but significantly larger, so better for larger groups, but you'll probably still have to wait. The Kao Soi and Masaman curries were both super delicious! Good portion sizes as well."}
{"text":"This was place is awesome. Will be back for the chicken pad Thai. The atmosphere was great and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really liked this place but get there early for lunch or make a dinner reso....filled up within 30 minutes of opening on Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Wow, there's over a thousand reviews to this place. Cool. That just shows glhow great it is. 

Location:
Downtown toronto.  2 blocks from King Street street car.

Parking situation:
May the force be with you. 
Actually I exaggerate. There's a parking garage practically around the corner. Lots of spaces. Pretty reasonable. 

Entrance:
The sign has an arrow pointing up but it's in the basement. Confusing at first.

Seating:
Been a few times. The last time. It opened at 3. We got there at 3:15 and had to sit at the bar. Crazy. After we ordered 20 minutes later we looked and there was a line at the door. Crazier. 

They have floor seating apparently as well. No thanks. 

Food:
Delicious. Loved everything. I'm not even going g to list everything I've tried and lived. It's all good. For real.

Price:
Not bad. Upper end for Thai food, bit Thai is normally super inexpensive anyway. Won't break the bank
 

I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Pai is by far the best Thai food I've had in Toronto. The food is top notch and the service is always good!

It's always super busy but don't let that stop you as the wait times are never long. If you want a reservation you have to book far in advance!

Some of my favourites are the pad Thai and the soup. Every dish I've tried there has been great.

I also love the decor! Super fun and modern!! You can get some great photos."}
{"text":"Went during winter 2017. 

Best Thai food I have eaten in Toronto.  Fresh and wonderful. Good about making things vegetarian. 

It is a busy place so expect long line ups, but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to come to Pai for a while now after hearing such rave reviews. Having tried places like Sukho Thai and Khao San Road, I had high expectations since I love Thai food but Pai did not disappoint in the slightest! 

We got there a little after 6pm to beat the dinner rush and luckily we did since after we were seated, the line grew two-fold and you can feel the room getting increasingly louder. It definitely has more of a party atmosphere so not the best place if you are someone looking for a quiet dining experience. 

But it's fun, lively, and full of personality. They even have a small marketplace in the back where you can get some food items to go and other knick knacks. 

We ordered the squash fritter as an app along with their signature pad thai with shrimp and chicken. Everything was absolutely delicious. The pad thai just got better and better with every bite! The quality was definitely the best I've ever tried. All the dishes are jam packed with flavor and left us wanting more. The squash fritter (which they also have at Khao San Road) were so well seasoned, crunchy on the outside and sweet inside. Highly addictive! I recommend checking this place out and coming early to snag a table!"}
{"text":"I have officially visited Pai Northern many many many many times now. Khao San Road has been delicious but it's small and packed. Pai Northern is a different story.

The seating is comfortable. Service is quick and fantastic. Staff will actually notice you and check on you. The green curry comes in a coconut. Definitely ask to pack and take it home with you!

The squash fritters are delicious. But my favourite squash fritters are from Dubai Dubai. 

I always order the Khao Soi noodles, the golden curry with noodles. Yummmmmm yum yum. I just cannot get enough of it! I've had other curry as well, all are flavourful it's like BEAUTIFUL. A+ curries!!! 

Pad thai was \"okay.\" My favourite pad thai is up north in Minden, Ontario."}
{"text":"I had food in Thailand and this place came pretty close. We ordered papaya salad (could have been spicier), oxtail (10/10) and laap salad (my first time trying this, very good). They also had great selection of beer and cocktails. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pai has some awesome Thai food. I love the decor of the restaurant and I will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai restaurant you can find in Toronto Imo. Everything on their menu tastes delicious and authentic. Chef Regular prides herself on using the best ingredients possible to recreate the food of her native country. Her efforts shine through in the cuisine here, as you'll be hard pressed to find a dish that doesn't leave a lasting impression. 

My favourite item here is probably the Khao Soi. It is rich in flavour with an amazing balance of savory and sweetness. The consistency always seems to be perfect as well-never too watery or oily for a broth. Combined with large tender chunks of protein (chicken or beef), this dish is an absolute winner at Pai. 

The Pad Thai here is also very good. Probably second only to the signature one at Khao San Road. I love the flavour of its tamarind sauce, but I wasn't a fan of the cabbage that came on the side. It gave the dish some texture but took away from its flavour Imo. Good thing it came on the side, so that it's optional to mix in with the noodles =) 

Last item of note is the Thai Iced Tea. Unlike most Thai restaurants that serve this drink, I found the one at Pai to be less sweet and more enjoyable as a result. Mine came with crushed ice that was refreshing to drink through the straw as well =D

Overall, you need to eat at Pai if you love Thai food! Try to make a reservation online if you can, as walk in wait times can be frustrating at this popular joint."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite finds. It's a cute, small underground restaurant with a huge personality. This is a very busy place so I suggest you make your reservations well ahead of time. We weren't able to make a reservation so we had to wait about 40 minutes before we got a table but I can tell you it was definitely worth it. I ordered the gaeng masaman with braised beef, it's a very sweet curry but I highly recommend it. I loved it."}
{"text":"So delicious. I feel like I'm back in Pai whenever I eat there.   Delicious drinks as well. Expect a lineup but you can put down your name and grab a drink there or elsewhere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"excellent, love this place. the food was great and a big fan of the raptor themed cocktails."}
{"text":"The space is pretty cool. It has a street- like vibe. Went there aroud 5pm on a weekday, didn't have to wait but the restaurant filled up quickly. Tables are rather close to each other. Ordered pad thai and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lair.  The first time I went I didn't realize the place was more than a tight dive bar, but the place has layers. Great energy and service, the staff are super nice.  Smaller menu, but each dish looks really good in its on way, so it's hard to choose.  Will be back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Pai and the associated restaurants are the best spots for real authentic Thai food. I haven't had a bad meal. My faves are the Pad Gra Prow, Chiang Mai Noodle Soup, Satay, Squash Fritters. These are the original group of people from the original Khao San Road (before the split) and Sukho Thai. All amazing and never disappoints. I recommend making reservations or walk in on a non peak hours. Otherwise you may wait up to an hour, depending when."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness my dish delicious. I got the Gaeng Masaman, but instead of braised beef I got chicken. This is how the dish is described on the menu, \"Braised beef in a peanut, tamarind curry with potatoes and topped with deep fried crispy shallots. Served with steamed jasmine rice.\" 

Let me begin by saying I thought I didn't like curry. I had curry a few times and I've just been turned off to it ever since, so I was hesitant looking through a menu that seemed to have a fair few curry dishes. The friend I was with had been to Thailand however, and said that this dish was her boyfriend's favourite and that I should give it a go, so I did.

The curry was just the right amount of soupy with large, satisfying bits of potato and chicken throughout. I would take handfuls of the jasmine rice and submerge it in the curry and eat it by the spoonful - and it tasted heavenly. It was just the tiniest bit sweet, with peanut-y hues, and a curry that I could tell was a curry, but not overwhelmingly so. 

I never write reviews but I enjoyed this dish so much that I had to. I will definitely be returning, and will go to Pai if I need to convert any other non-curry believers. Also worth mentioning: the establishment is super cozy, the lighting is dim but not overly dark with lanterns and hanging flags and other decorations that make the place seem delightfully Thai. Service was super quick and we didn't have to wait around for ages to pay our bill.

Can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"Love love love. Everything on the menu is so good. The curries are flavourful and kao soi is good (but a little too rich for me). Pad Thai is my go to! Service is friendly. My favourite Thai spot in the city!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always a lineup; you cannot go wrong ordering anything on the menu; especially the Pad Grow Pow, Khao Soi, or the Penang Curry!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant without reading any reviews and what a great choice. We were seated right away by a very pleasant host. 
The server was great, pleasant,  efficient, and personable. 
We had a curry and soup  (can't remember the name but it had lemon grass). Both were absolutely delicious.

If you're n the area, try this place out."}
{"text":"If you have been to Thailand or a proper Thai restaurant then you'll like this spot.  

Curries are fantastic and pad thai is excellent.   They also can make it thai spicy as well - which is pretty hot.  

Definitely a recommended spot if you're craving thai food.

{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I have ever had. 

+ The pad Thai, tom yum soup, and the curry (I like the green curry) are so delicious!! Definitely recommend
+ There is a big menu with various appetizers and main dishes
+ Lines are long and there's usually always a wait unless you go here during non-peak hours or make a reservation
+ It gets quite loud in here so expect to raise your voice sometimes if you're talking within your table
+ Due to the popularity of the place, it can sometimes get a bit crowded inside and you may be sitting really close to the table beside you
+ They serve alcohol

This place will definitely not disappoint. 
Great place to try Thai food for the first time!"}
