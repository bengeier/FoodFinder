{"text":"Ordered nachos,  had to send them back. Cheese not melted and cold chicken. Asked for extra salsa but it never came. Refried nachos were good, but soggy at the bottom from the canned bean liquid."}
{"text":"Great place for reasonably priced food.  Are here twice during our family vacation to Vegas... great big times.  Great burgers, sandwiches and apps!"}
{"text":"Went to Hennessey's last night. Went in just to have one drink and ended up staying all night. The bar tenders, Liionel and Mark were a lot of fun and very nice. Food servings were large. Overall, great night out."}
{"text":"The food was marginal (soggy fries, food lacked flavor). The server disappeared for what seemed like long periods of time. The band, \"garage boys\", played covers. They sounded okay and played upbeat songs and got the crowd going a bit. Then the band started making sexist, homophobic jokes and the jokes weren't even funny to top it off. They Sang to a woman who was there for her and her husbands anniversary and her birthday. In the middle of the song they added \"show is your boobs\" while the couple was dancing. Seemed like 40 year olds trying to be 20 again...lame.  I wish I had gotten a hot dog at the hot dog stand."}
{"text":"Wandered in on Friday night around 10 or 10:30 because the band in there was ROCKING it!! I approached the host who was leaning on her hand at the host stand and asked if it was open seating. She nodded so I went straight to a table right in front of the stage. I was about the go to the bar to order a drink, and maybe some fries or nachos but I noticed that all the tables around me had servers tending to them so eagerly awaited for one to approach. I sat there for about 4 songs and noticed that a table that seated itself behind me a few minutes after I'd sat down had a server tending to them. At this point I no longer had an appetite for food. But still wanted a beer. Servers kept walking right past me, attending to other tables, even empty ones with dirty dishes were getting plenty of attention, I was not. The band finished the set they were on, took a break, then got back on stage--still I was ignored. I began to wonder if perhaps I was invisible. But when a man at a table next to me (seated long after me, and was being attended to be a server) kept asking me if I wanted to dance, I thought, nope. I must not be invisible. Then finally, a server approached my table! I was about to order a beer, and was going to ask why no one had come to help me after about 30 minutes of me enjoying the music. She put a couple of silverware rolls on the table, looked right at me, then walked away. I stayed for a couple more songs and left. I was planning on spending the $20 I'd won at black jack at the D down the street on beer there that night. But I left completely sober and thirsty. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is becasue that band was so good I might just be back if they play there often. I guess I'll just have to bring my own beer."}
{"text":"We were not seated, had to seek a person to get a table & had a don't care attitude. In fact very slow service & the whole staff had a less than enthusiastic attitude. Seemed like they did not want to be there on a Thursday night at 7:30pm. It wasn't super crowded, & food was ok."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the time or money. We got charged 3 different taps into almost $300... The wait staff is rude and has very poor attitudes. I know it's expensive on Fremont Experience for just about everything, but this place is a rip off. I will not be going there ever again."}
{"text":"We called into Hennesseys for a pint one night and they had a brilliant band on, so we stayed and called back another night. The decor is very authentic of an Irish pub. Plenty of seats and tables available. We didn't have food but the grub that was coming out looked and smelt amazing. They have plenty of whiskeys on offer and even bottles of Harp!  Best thing about Hennesseys has to be the bar man Jeremy. He was so friendly and professional. Great craic!!! Loved him. The 2nd night we were here the band was really not the best, Jeremy more than made up for that. We stumbled out hours later very happy and very merry too! Brilliant hospitality :)"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place.  They have alot of potential.  Granted, my review is from St. Patrick's day so keep that in mind.  Although we visited at lunch time & it wasn't a madhouse.  The menu is extremely limited.  Not sure if that is normal or because it was a holiday.  Hard to find something to eat if you are picky (like my boyfriend).  He was not impressed with his chicken fingers, actually made him sick and run to the bathroom.    The waitress was hard to track down.  Half of our visit was looking for her to refill our drinks, bring napkins or get the check.    Might return, not sure.  Pricing was decent.  Place could use a good deep cleaning."}
{"text":"Pub food. Not my favourite, maybe not the review to go by. But I mean I got fish and chips, something I can greatly enjoy elsewhere, but not here. The fries were that yucky grainy from-the-freezer variety. I think the fish was also from frozen. They were these little breaded fish pucks, four of them. So, yeah, likely from frozen. Meh, pass."}
{"text":"Band on Saturday night was awesome, drinks were good, and staff were nice.  We got there too late for food but it seemed like a decent menu. Had a nice time with friends. Place was clean and pub style so it was enjoyable to hang there."}
{"text":"I went in with my boyfriend and we were told to sit wherever we wanted so after choosing a table, not a single server came for us. A table of 8 people came in and sat after us and got their orders taken and the table behind us got checked on and bussed. We sat there for 20minutes and just left without anyone noticing us. It wasn't busy at all. Terrible service."}
{"text":"We went for Karaoke. The bartenders took care of us, but the DJ was just rude to everyone in my group. We weren't messy or obnoxious or anything that deserves rudeness. The last call was at midnight (yes, in Vegas) so we were shuffled out the door pretty promptly after."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place the waitress suck in there customers service food is bland no flavor and the restroom are all clogged and backed up flooding the waitress said it's a normal thing here I'm grossed out !!!"}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and great service!  Service was quick and the burgers were delicious. We stop here whenever we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here! The service is great and the food is awesome. They always have great deals. We are here on Tuesday and they have BOGO Burgers! They burgers are super juicy and flavorful. The ambience is chill, there's gaming at the bar and you have great music outside from the Fremont talent."}
{"text":"Just a quick bite to eat. Shocktop beer 24 oz was perfect!! Fish tacos were bearable not going to get again. Service was good with lots of attention - it was slow time. Sat outside in the sun.  Serves breakfast, lunch, dinner and bar items."}
{"text":"We had SHANA help us and she was really friendly with amazing service constantly refilled our drinks and didn't leave empty plates behind. It was a slow afternoon when I went so I'm not sure how it is when it's busy but I'd definitely come again. The food was delicious I loved the French fries!"}
{"text":"I have been living in Las Vegas for 20 years and I have to Hennessys many times over the years and have always enjoyed the location and atmosphere however went there with some friends from out of town last night and was possibly the worst service I have ever had in lv. The cocktail waitress was completely nonexistent and we had go to the bar order our drinks and then she brought them to our table. I could understand if they were busy there was literally 10 people in the bar. Waitress was too busy talking to her friends for 2 hours to come and take our drink order. Pathetic never again"}
{"text":"There's only a few reviews and their mostly negative. Here is my outlook on it. We just finished lunch here with some delicious fish and chips, some guiness and tea.   Sammy is a great waitress, we enjoyed it here.  I've been to the one in redondo and this one reminds me of it. Also you can take alcohol to go, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The French onion soup might as well have been molten lava. The cheese was even burnt and not melty. The pesto chicken sandwich was ok but he tomato was only on half, not much attention to details. Luckily for me I chose the right half since I don't like tomato anyway"}
{"text":"No go. Short staffed, waited a Long time for food, now we have to go. Couldn't even eat.  Staff it better people, especially on a Sunday Mornjng of a very busy weekend"}
{"text":"Had the Jameson ribs and fries. Both were awesome. It came with coleslaw that didn't taste like anything but it didn't matter since the entree was so good."}
{"text":"We were the only table in the restaurant besides two people sitting at the bar. My Bloody Mary was very good. Once I finished that, we sat with no water refill and no food for over a half hour until we asked about our food. The food was bland with absolutely no taste. Ordered our burgers medium and they came out well done. The Parmesan encrusted sourdough just tastes like burnt cheese and the burgers have zero flavor to them. When the waitress finally came over to refill our waters, it was with warm water and no ice, and she never checked on us again until we cashed out. With all of the options on Fremont street, I'm bummed we chose this one. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. It would have been a different story if it was busy or if the waitress would have apologized. I was in the industry all through college, it was just all around bad service and sub par food."}
{"text":"Such a great time with great food and super drinks. Mark is a very good  bartender and very helpful teaching us how to play the slot machines. He is very attentive and made for a wonderful afternoon.  We really liked the Mexican mule and the Dublin mule."}
{"text":"Autumn was the best waitress around.. if only Las Vegas was full of Autumns it would be a better place. Thank you for the great service and great beer, cheers."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast. We were excited to try an Irish Pub on Fremont for breakfast. The food was ok. It seemed as if the employees working were happy to be there, so we received what ordered without a smile."}
{"text":"Service here SUCKS! Sitting here waiting for our order. WE WILL NEVER COME BACK! The drinks here do come quick but the kitchen here is the slowest i have ever seen! So after waiting 50 minutes the ribs showed up ICE COLD! We sent them back. Do NOT come to this hole! Terrible service!"}
{"text":"We came to have lunch ... We did get the beer right away but it was almost 20 minutes before anyone came back to take our order. Because of that we decided not to eat there. We ended up having look for someone to get a check. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a couple of drinks. My large Guinness was perfect. My wife ordered a Baileys but received a Carolinian's instead...she knows the difference. If you don't carry Baileys, then tell the customers please."}
