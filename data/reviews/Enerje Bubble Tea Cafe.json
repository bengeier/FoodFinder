{"text":"I've always heard of Enerje Cafe through the radio and always told myself that I would check it out, finally caved and decided to go check it out.  The location is great, it's fairly easy to get to. The cafe is located on Falconridge Drive close by to surrounding businesses such as Mac's, McDonald's, and Tutti Frutti just to name a few. There are loads of parking so you won't have to worry about space.  When you walk in you'll notice a koi fish artwork by the entrance and unlike most traditional cafes and restaurants, you're given the freedom to sit where ever you please. At the far back of the cafe there are two pool tables. The atmosphere is pretty laid back, with friendly employees and low key EDM playing to enhance the vibe. There are flat screen televisions that project either music videos or a playlist to which where the music is playing from.  The menu had great food selection, my girlfriend had ordered a pound of wings while I ordered their Filipino peanut butter sauced braised oxtail with steam rice. The wait time wasn't drastically too long and it came in a timely manner. The wings were great and it was the first time for me that the meat to rice ratio was on par. The Filipino peanut butter sauce oxtail dish is my all time favourite and I love seeing different take on it, and for the first time this dish was different in a whole new level for me. The bubble tea was great and was served in a glass that to me looked like a flower vase.  Enerje Cafe is a great place to go to for food, entertainment, and bubble tea. If you need a new place to visit then I strongly recommend Enerje. They are a +1 in my books and will definitely come back next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious bubble tea!!!! Love there bubble tea will definitely come here for wings with my friends. Cute spot to hang it and play pool. The waiter/host is handsome."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of my friends and three of our bubble tea tasted funny so we asked to change all three and with no hesitation he changed all three no problem I was very impressed with their service. The wings are also so good and cheap! I recommend the soy garlic! This place is a hidden gem. Normally not too busy so the food comes out pretty fast. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place walking in. There's a pretty cool Koi Fish artwork by the entrance. They also have a pool table and air hockey table as well. Came in for the bubble tea (strawberry banana and red bean coconut; which by the way was really good), but also ended up getting some Parmesan garlic fries which were amazing. Definitely recommend giving the place a try. Was pretty quiet when we came in (around 20:30) so the service was really good."}
{"text":"Welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  Awesome bubble tea - quality ingredients, super fresh and great selection of flavours.  Also offers pool tables, a pretty extensive pub-plus style menu, lots of seating and TV's, mellow atmosphere with wicked staff that make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Went to go get bubble tea with boyfriend. Interior was rather trendy looking but not as bumpin as i felt it could be. Avocado bubble tea was underwhelming, strawberry pineapple was good. Service was pretty quick. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"We came on a quiet Thursday night and just ordered take out for bubble tea. The place is very spacious and quite hip looking. The bubble tea were made of fresh ingredients and were definitely very yummy! We would come back for a sit in meal next time and interested in playing pool for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place came for the all you can eat chicken wings and bbt event with some friends. Place was so busy because of the event but we got a table. The place was clean and modern; nice place to hang out with friends. There's pool tables too.  The bbt was made with fresh fruit; large cups too. The chicken wings were amazing. Lots of different flavours to choose from. 5/5 for the food and drink. Even though they were so busy the waitress was friendly and came by our table regularly to see if we needed anything.   Overall great place! I would definitely come back to try other items on there menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Asian cuisines Great food with reasonable price. 10$ for authentic ramen noodles. And bubbles tea with real fruits"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to get my mango bubbletea. The bubbletea's are fresh and their chicken wings ARE THE BOMB. I would recommend coming here if there is a group of you wanting to get bubbletea and chicken wings since they have great deals ($10/person for bbt AND wings). This deal is super cheap compared to other restaurants (for all you students) and their proportions fill you up!  TIP: I would recommend telling them to get their bubbletea TO-GO since the to-go cup is much bigger than the to-stay glass."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in this neck of the woods! Lots of flavours and they have these popping pearls, which are the bomb! The chicken wings are really really good. Fried crispy with lots of choices for flavour.   This place is geared towards teens, there is no alcohol and loads of teen pop music/videos playing. They have pool tables, too.   Staff has always been friendly and forthcoming with recommendations."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 wings are good, went in an all you can eat night but the wings were crispy even though they were so busy. Bubble tea was fresh.   Service 5/5 servers were polite even though they were busy. Special thanks to Christine who kept checking in on us even though the whole place was packed full of ppl .  Parking 5/5 lots of parking   Atmosphere 5/5 very clean . Very open space doesn't make you feel like you 're bumping into other ppl. Kid friendly . They have pool table, foosball table, tv's, juke box.  Defiantly would come back with friends & family!"}
