{"text":"Best hookah in Pittsburgh.  Great service and atmosphere, which varies depending on when you go.  Weekday nights are more chill and relaxed, with Friday and Saturday nights having more of a party atmosphere with a live DJ.  

Like I said, by far best tasting and longest lasting hookah in Pittsburgh.  Great service means getting coals regularly to keep it going.  The hookahs themselves are of the highest quality, keeping the tobacco going much longer with a much better taste.

 It is also BYOB, so stop in at the nearby bars or distributor and they will stash your beer for you.  Prices are also really reasonable.  We can't stay away!"}
{"text":"Not typically a huge fan of hookah but had an amazing time here. Great vibe and great music. The people were friendly and the employees came over to check up on us several times. Thought the prices were reasonable, was less than $20 and split amongst us only came out to a few bucks each. The flavor was good and the hookah lasted us all night. I am definitely going to be back here soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good and chill. Was kinda in a sketchy neighborhood, but you felt safe inside. The people are nice enough, but not rude. They play lots a rap, but not too loud. Lots of Arabs in there, but it's all good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool to hangout with friends and smoke a hookah with. Food is okay not like it's a 5 star restaurant but not like chucke cheese pizza. You have to be 18 and they have a lot of flavors to smoke can be a little rough on the treat the first couple of times but yeah. It's not bad"}
{"text":"It is very easy to find. I came on a monday night and the place wasn't to busy. It has a nice relaxed vibe to it. There is a decent selection of tabacco. Mostly Starbuzz and Al Faker. The staff was very friendly and even made some great suggestions for flavors. Only $5 to try a different flavor after the initial price. Free wifi and its pretty clean.

The only down side would be the seating. The seats aren't really that comfortable when compared to other Hookah bars that I have been to. Also it was a little warm in the store. So that is my reason for 4 stars today."}
{"text":"Definitely the best hookah bar in PGH. I've never been here for the belly dancing or the DJ on the weekends, but I enjoy making the trip midweek to hang out for a few hours. It's got more energy to it without being overwhelming.

The BYOB is also clutch and since there's a store right next door that stays open kinda late, it's a one-stop trip. Looks like they're also opening up an eatery too, so soon it will have literally everything you need to enjoy an evening out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The newest and coolest hang out spot for everyone of all ages. The atmosphere is calm during the day and wild and fun at night. DJ Tweak spins the best music in the burgh and he spins at Mint Hookah! Everyone gets up and starts dancing which is an added bonus. Check this place out for your next night out."}
{"text":"I suppose if this is your thing... First impressions, location is quite poor. Best thing in area is Hispanic grocery and goods store across the street. Locale itself is pretty beat. Go here only if you absolutely must. Dark (at night), music is good if Chris is spinning the tunes. But the environment itself is really lackluster. The place lacks what people would consider \"character.\" I have to give it a low rating overall."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better hookah bars in Pittsburgh. I would give it 3 1/2 if i could.

The DJ is great and usually places pretty great tunes. The gyro stand outside the place is quite amazing. That being said, the place gets very crowded so trying to find a seat is usually an issue.

The hookahs are a little overpriced as all of the hookah places in pittsburgh are and the the environment is a little more 'clubby' than 'chill' which I am not sure is a good or a bad thing. The place opens till late so if after a night of drinking you aren't done with hanging out yet, you can stop by enjoy a few hookah puffs with your friends."}
