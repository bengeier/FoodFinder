{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  Portions are good sizes too and the prices are fair. I usually get the the lo mein or the wonton soup and the shrimp fried rice. I find that they're all delicious.  We have always enjoyed it every time we come here and the staff is pretty friendly as well.  I consider this a pretty decent Chinese restaurant for the area."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese food I have ever had. The wonton soup tastes of dirty dishwater ,eggroll filled w old grease and the chicken was dry and not even sure it was chicken. Stay away from this disgusting place. WORST EVER!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese takeout.  The food is exceptional quality and great value with large portions.  My families favorites are General Tso's and the Lo mein.  Egg rolls and won ton soup are very good.  Owners are very friendly and appreciative of customers and business."}
{"text":"Honeymoon Chinese eat in or take out is excellent. I love their friendliness there and their great tasting food"}
{"text":"Order from here about five times a year.  Can't remember ever having anything not meet our expectations.  Always piping hot.  Love the egg drop soup, beef lo mein, and vegetable egg rolls.  Staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"Honeymoon provides consistently excellent value.  I've been a customer since the place opened.  And I've always been pleased.  Their prices are very reasonable and they're very friendly.   I strongly recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"Very good. Stopped in on a lunch break. Food took less than 5 minutes. I got an egg roll and a shrimp with broccoli lunch special. Traditional and tasty."}
{"text":"Just had this for the first time this past Friday I had the sweet and sour chicken meal glad it came with white rice (I usually have to sub it out) My wife had the general tso's chicken with friend rice ......

My Sweet and Sour was 100% on point and awesome just what I wanted I cant believe I waited all these years to try this place that was less than 5 mins from my house the Chicken was cooked perfect,sticky rice was perfect and the sauce was a tad watery but no big deal

My wifes General tso's was good ...the chicken was good for her taste was good...only drawbacks for her was with the rice...She didn't see where the Broccoli or the Peas fit in with the rice cause at other places shes never had it with those in it but other than that it was good. 

will def be eating here again"}
{"text":"Its cheap and the quality is good for what you pay. Weirdly enough their sweet and sour soup is dense and high quality."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food that I ever ate.  I've never been disappointed in anything that I've ever ordered.  Fast and Friendly service."}
{"text":"1. I placed an order online and selected the delivery option. They called over 10 minutes later to confirm the order. 40 minutes later they still hadn't shown up. I called only to be told that they do not even do deliveries at all and that I had to come pick it up. It is only a 3 minute drive but I was NOT happy.

2. Their fried rice is rice ONLY. No veggies of any kind in it. I typically LOVE fried rice but this was just mediocre.

I will NOT go back. I even told them to keep their stupid menu they tried to put in the bag because I would NEVER come back.

ADDED:
NOW I find out they charged my card 2 times. WTH"}
{"text":"Honeymoon is close by my house, so not a bad stop if I'm in the mood for Chinese. There's a few other Chinese restaurants in the Irwin area: some better, some not as good. So, I'd say it falls somewhere in the middle, taste and selection wise. The prices are reasonable and, if you call ahead for takeout, they are extremely fast. Generally, I will call then leave my house and the food is ready when I get there a few minutes later. 

Although there are a few tables inside, this really isn't a sit-down type of place, mostly just take out. The biggest downfall is, since the kitchen is open and practically right behind the counter, your clothes smell like fried food immediately after leaving."}
{"text":"Food is good but over priced. And they ALMOST got the order correct. They ended up giving us too much rice when I didn't ask for it and we got charged for it too."}
{"text":"The employees were very friendly. But the lo mein that I just ate was one of the worst things I've ever had.  The microwaveable lo meins blow it out of the water and I think that says a lot. Sorry :/"}
{"text":"Great customer service and made to order food! Very knowledgeable with the allergy questions we had. Good people"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food and great value! Lunch specials are between $6-$7 and it comes with soup and fried rice. I am allergic to MSG and they DO NOT use MSG here which is sometimes hard to come by when eating Chinese. I'm not sure what the other reviewers were talking about I've had vegetables in my fried rice every time! Always Friendly, and always ready in 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"cheap.
That's about the only positive I can come up with.
We placed our takeout order: Large Hot & Sour soup, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Moo Goo Gai Pan and steamed white rice (they don't have brown). When the person taking the order said it would be ready in 10 minutes, I got very nervous and should have respected my instincts.
The only redeemable items were the soup & the rice. The soup was respectable, actually. Nice flavor balance between sour and spicy, loaded with tofu and other veggies. A strange yellow tint to the broth, maybe turmeric. What would turmeric be doing in hot & sour soup? The rice was perfectly steamed.
The Kung Pao chicken was not spicy at all, even though we had requested it to be. The meat was battered and deep fried, which was actually a plus as we discovered by tasting the slimy meat in the other two dishes. Seriously--slimy. Not edible.
Our order came to $34.00 and pretty much went straight to the trash."}
{"text":"This place is Ok. My wife likes the garlic chicken and they are always friendly. It's not great Chinese but for the money it's just fine."}
{"text":"I ordered online using their website and it said my food would ready in 15 minutes. I got there in ten minutes and the lady said my food wasn't ready yet, no big deal so I waited some more. Another 20 minutes go by and I ask the younger girl when my order would be ready and she said she didn't have any orders that matched what I wanted. So I left to go get pizza rather than wait on these screw ups. Well, an hour later my phone rings and I get a call from here saying my food is ready and I should come pick it up.   I told the lady I was standing inline at the restaurant for half an hour and I didn't want the food anymore. Then she gave me attitude for not wanting the food they expected me to wait. 90 minutes for."}
{"text":"Always great service. Very good food and cheap! I'm a weekly customer."}
