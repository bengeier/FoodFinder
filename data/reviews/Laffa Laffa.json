{"text":"Good, solid, plentiful food, great prices. Freshly made laffa stuffed with your choice of many options. Hummus plates! Ultra casual dining. Open late on Sunday nights. The hot tea is fantastic. Authentic comfort food. So happy."}
{"text":"Great first experience at this new restaurant.  Chicken shish kabab was great and fresh made salad was amazing!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Place just opened up at Counterpoint mall. Not bad, but I've had a lot better. Service is great, very friendly and a warm environment. They ask you if you need more sauce and are very accommodating. In terms of the laffa, I've had better (i.e. Dr. Laffa). The shawarma plate is huge and definitely shareable...but there's something missing. Not so sure what but it's definitely not on par with Orly's or Dr. Laffa. Not the best but at least they have great service.  I really like good food though so unfortunately I'm giving it a 3/5 as it needs improvement on quality food and flavour."}
{"text":"4 stars out of 5  We've been here quite a few times.  Their chicken shish kebab is very moist.  Their ground beef pide is quite good as well.  Conveniently located at the Centre Point mall right beside Congee Queen.  The place is nice and quiet.  People usually order for take out but there are seats for seating.  The service is very nice and friendly as the last who serves us there remembers our order from last time.  Would be coming back.  Update: Updating review to 3 stars since we last went there yesterday and was disappointed at their chicken shish kebab.  It is no longer moist and was dry.  They ground beef pide is still good though."}
{"text":"I only got to try the beef shwarma because they didn't have chicken shwarma that day. On a hot day the AC wasn't on, although the employees were really nice and the decor was neat and modern. The meat was average in flavour, but was succulent. My friend's chicken kebab was dry. Expensive. They have these cool sparkling juices.. tasty but high in sugar lol. Don't think I'd come back."}
{"text":"Opened not long ago this place has some delicious food. The staff are all very friendly and helpful when you have questions. I'd never heard of pide before ordering it & they convinced me it was good. They weren't wrong! It's like a flatbread pizza and soooo delicious. The food its slightly pricey for what you get but I think worth it. Presentation of food, quality and service are all great so I would rather buy food here than in the food court where its cheaper but they just slap your food into a styrofoam container. The decor is nice as well. Being newly opened everything is shiny and new and neat."}
