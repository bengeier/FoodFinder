{"text":"I can only say good decor and packages. presentation and foods needs lot of improvements, Whatever display on the counter didn't caught my attention or surprise me not even their menu. A bakery place I will only come one time."}
{"text":"This is such a cute bakery with lots of character. I've only been here once, and at that time, it wasn't completely packed- luckily! The staff were all polite and welcoming.  The desserts my cousin and I had were very tasty as well. For a person who has a lot of food sensitivities and is gluten free, this place really is a wonderful spot. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but what completely ruins this for me is that it closes at 7PM... especially in the summer this is ridiculous. It's a cafe... it should NOT be closing before it's even dark outside... this is no way to bring more customers in and frankly makes me not want to even go. They really need to change their hours to at LEAST 8 or 9 PM. I like the cafe but I feel like I'm being driven out since it closes before even an 8 year old's bed time..."}
{"text":"This bakery is not only beautiful, but has delicious treats! We went to the Sorelle and Co. shop in the food hall near the mall and it was such a great experience. Though it is not evident at first glance, this bakery is free of the top allergens: no dairy, egg, nuts, peanuts, soy, and gluten. This is great for us because our daughter is allergic to most of those. We went to Sorelle on a recent trip to Toronto specifically for our daughter, who has never eaten out before. At this bakery, she could choose whatever she wanted because it was all safe. Our family all got doughnuts and decadent cupcakes. They were packaged beautifully and then we ate them at a nearby table. You would NEVER know these treats were allergen free! I am not allergic to any foods and I would not have been able to tell these were dairy, egg, nut etc. free if you did not tell me. And, of course, my daughter enjoyed her desserts too. The young man behind the counter was very helpful answering questions and allaying my fears. These treats are a little pricier than your average treats, but they are also better too, in my opinion. The next time we come to Toronto, we will try Sorelle's other location in Vaughn, which has a restaurant and sit-down menu. We are super excited to have found this bakery and would definitely recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"The staff are very informed and helpful in knowing what ingredients are in and not in the desserts.  The desserts are fresh, moist and packed with flavor.  The nanaimo bar, banana bread chocolate cupcake, cinnamon bun, and even the loaf bread are tasty.  The brownie is yummy as well.  Can you tell I've been here a few times, LOL?"}
{"text":"This cafe looks gorgeous! And I'm amazed that we have something like this uptown. Really love the idea of gluten free vegan food, but was a bit disappointed,  that's why not giving it 5 stars. I had tacos and my daughter had grilled vegetable sandwich with salad. For the price they charge they could do better on quality and quantity. The portions are tiny. However I love their sweets selection, everything tasted great so far. I think they should just stick to bakery or seriously improve food."}
{"text":"The double chocolate cupcakes have a sublet coffee taste that is utterly divine. My wife swears the Nanaimo bar is amazing too."}
{"text":"Worth trying if you are a high tea and cup cake fan. U should order at the counter first and waitress will bring the food to you"}
{"text":"Really gorgeous and elegant interior so I was sold just by the visual aspect. I'm not vegan so that wasn't particularly a selling point but I can say that it was quite delicious despite that aspect of the menu which is very commendable. I had oolong milk tea and their grilled cheese for lunch. More details on the blog: https://wywhitneytam.wordpress.com/2017/01/15/sorelle-and-co/"}
{"text":"What a pleasure to find great vegan food and wonderful baked goods in Thornhill/Richmond Hill area!  And with really helpful staff.    We had the chocolate tart and blueberry scone which were really great and better than most similar non-vegan pastries elsewhere.    The coffee is individually brewed and it was very good too.   Will be back to sample the sandwiches.   Also did buy the bread so here's hoping!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised to find that such a place exists in Vaughan!   The restored house is stunning. It's beautifully decorated and the view to the kitchen is a nice touch.  I normally do not eat dessert or baked goods, but everything was amazing!  It should not matter that everything here is vegan, nut-free, dairy-free and soy-free, but it does. :) Nobody will have an excuse not to try anything from here. They are very careful about their supplier to ensure that the ingredients are pure.  A must if you're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The only nuts in here are donuts! :P  I was in awe of the spread of gluten-free, vegan, treats!  I didn't know what I wanted to try!  The maple creme donut, smore tart, nanaimo bar... I went with the bar - super delicious!  As for hot eats, I ordered a grilled cheese made with vegan cheese and challah chic pea bread.  The service here was friendly, but it was very, very busy due to a private function upstairs. I'll come back for afternoon tea - make sure you call ahead! :)"}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying this place for a while. Finally got the chance to come today on my day off. We were greeted by friendly staff when we stepped in. Sorelle's interior is beautifully designed.   Let me break this down as to why I give it only 3 stars: 1) service 2) ambience  3) presentation   To be honest, we were quite disappointed with their selection. Mind you that it was 1 hour to closing but I feel that it shouldn't be an excuse. For the price you pay, you are definitely not receiving the quality that you should expect. We ordered the opera cake and strawberry heart shape mousse cake. Both of which shared something in common which are too dry and way too sweet.   For those still interested, come early for possibly a wider selection. We were surprised at the end of our visit as we received complimentary tarts to go."}
{"text":"10 thumbs up!!!  We had the red velvet cupcakes and chocolate raspberry 'donut'!! It a special treat for my daughter's 9th birthday and they rated super yummy!  Great service!  Gorgeous cafe!!"}
{"text":"I visited Sorelle yesterday and tried their grilled cheese and mushroom. Honestly I couldnt  tell the cheese was vegan and tasted great.  I would recommend if you're looking for guilt free indulgence."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 7 on a Saturday afternoon for my friends High Tea birthday. We were running late but the staff at Sorelle were very friendly and accommodating to our delayed schedule.  Upon arriving, we were quickly seated and our server explained the different tea options we have. There is a a wide variety of teas to choose from including Jasmine, green, rooibos and many more. I chose the Persian tea which was delicious. Everyone is given either loose tea leaves or a tea bag and a few pots of hot water which is refilled periodically. Each table is also given coconut and soy milk on the side.   We all enjoyed the teas we chose and the entire atmosphere was very nice. The cups, pots, saucers and cutlery were beautiful. A special shout out to our server, I think her name is Eva, who was friendly and did a great job!  We were served 2 trays of bite-sized sandwiches/ hors d'ouveurs and a tiered tray of sweets. The savoury food was mediocre at best. I was expecting more flavour and quantity for the $40 per person price. Also, I suggest that tea leaves be changed to a fresh batch at least once. The tea loses strength after a couple of cups.  Overall, I would return here for the cute atmosphere, friendly service and tasty sweets. The high tea is good but not worth to do again."}
{"text":"Came here around noon on a Sunday   Pros: - pretty royal-like ambience   Cons: - Pricey  - Taste is well below par especially for what you pay  Taste: 3/10 Ambiance: 10/10 Price: 3/10  Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Finally got to check out Sorelle!  What a beautiful place!  Everything from setup, packaging, and plating, the golden spoons...aesthetically pleasing!! Too bad they don't have a larger space.  It was mid-day and busy.  Price wise, a bit steep, but worth visiting.  I really enjoyed the beet and quinoa salad (1/2 size) with the butternut squash (not pictured).  I also tried the mango cheesecake- it was scrumptious. You can tell it's not the typical cheesecake but they did a pretty good job with flavoring and texture.  The brownie (not pictured) I brought home to hubby was tasty but nowhere near a brownie texture, in his exact words \"a poor attempt at a chocolate cake\"."}
{"text":"This bakery is absolutely gorgeous. They have some vegan treats that I have had trouble finding in other vegan bakeries in Toronto. You can see right into the kitchen where the bakers are baking, there are servers who are actively trying to keep the place clean. The colour scheme is gorgeous, the chandeliers are gorgeous.   On to the taste... the tea latte I had (early grey) was lovely. The smores tart, which had beautiful presentation, was tasty... I love seeing menu items like this because it's something that is trickier to find vegan. The macaroon was simple, tasted fine, but the texture was off- it was crumbly. I bought a donut to take home (haven't tried it yet but it looks great) and their take-out packaging is lovely as well.   Any small vegan business needing support has mine, especially when it's as stunning and innovative as this one. You'll have trouble finding another vegan bakery alike to this one in the GTA."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful elegant place to have exquistite pasteries cupcakes and more.  If constent line ups and happy faces. Are indications...... Then you ate in for a delight."}
{"text":"You must try their grilled cheese sandwich! So good! They take their time making it, but it was worth the wait. I have only had a couple of their desserts and they were super fresh. Very cozy, cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Sorelle & Co and had an amazingly experience. I ordered a strawberry cheesecake and a raspberry and chocolate donut for my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. I also got a tea latte to-go.   Ambiance: First off, the cafe is absolutely spectacular! The interior is adorable and the perfect venue for a date, teas with the girls, family events, bridal showers and more. I honestly can't get over how beautiful this cafe was.   Service: The service was fantastic! All of the employees are professional and very nice. They helped me decide which desserts to buy and processed my order really efficiently.   Packaging: My desserts were packaged beautifully in a floral box and placed into a really nice travel bag. Everything about this cafe seemed fancy and elegant. I was worried my desserts wouldn't travel well but they looked amazing when I arrived at my final destination.   Desserts: The raspberry chocolate donut tasted great! It was really rich and flavourful and I loved the chocolate frosting on top of the donut since I have a real sweet tooth. The donut was everything I expected and more. I found the texture of the donut a little weird but still really enjoyed the flavour. The donut was my boyfriends favourite dessert and my favourite dessert was the strawberry cheesecake.   The strawberry cheesecake was absolutely delightful! Each serving is presented beautifully on its own. Each piece is round with a transparent fruit topping and gold edible flakes. The cheesecake was less sweet than the chocolate donut and the flavour was light and refreshing.  Both desserts were dairy and gluten free and I would highly recommend this cafe.   Tea Latte: My tea latte was really good. I ordered the celebratory Rooibos tea and really enjoyed it as a latte made with coconut milk. It was sweet and definitely helped me get through the afternoon hump.  Would I go back? - Definitely!!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, however, it is not what it claims to be. The restaurant claims that you can eat worry free, because it doesn't contain common allergens and unhealthy ingredients, such as soy, gluten and dairy. However, when you eliminate common ingredients from baked goods, you have to be careful to replace them with carefully chosen healthy substitutes. However, Sorelle replaced common ingredients with others that are not healthy at all, including palm oil, canola oil, and many other common chemicals, i.e. in their Daiya (I understand they don't make the cheese, but still). Seeing as I bake my own pastries gluten free and dairy free as well, and always use high quality organic, healthy ingredients, I know what it takes to make pastries work when you make those substitutions. Unfortunately, Sorelle doesn't deliver according to my standards. Since I eat healthy, my body totally knows when there is crap in my food, and I felt uneasy with everything that I consumed here, even though I do not have any particular food sensitivities. I tried this place twice. Once I got the grilled cheese sandwich (this tasted delicious but made me feel off - definitely because of the chemically laden cheese, their freshly baked bread was good). I also got the scone and cupcake (scone tolerable, cupcake not). The cupcake had a very strange taste to it and didnt sit well with me. Next time I tried the muffin and has the same experience as with the cupcake. Overall, I think the place claims to be healthy and I feel that customers are misled. If you want to use healthy oils, use coconut oil, peanut oil, even grapeseed oil would have been better, but palm and canola are inflammatory and not healthy substitutions. If you want truly healthy worry free foods, you can eat at Nature's Emporium or Rawlicious, or come on over to my place (lol)."}
{"text":"Come here for the setting - it's super cute and classy! (Nice for instagram, ahem). I tried a macchiato and a vanilla cupcake. Both were fine, but it was really the decor of the place which impressed. Warning: the place is not too large so if there is a private function on the day of your arrival (which was the case for me and my friend), you might run into some difficulty finding seating. Although it's a trite remark, the vegan cupcake did not taste \"vegan\" which I found impressive :) Not bad at all overall, but I'm still a Dineen's fan :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning environment, definitely unique and different.   Tried about 5 sweets (went with a group of people). Taste wise everything was OK. I'd say they were all about 4/10. The pastries are quite small too, for the price you're paying. The tart especially is very dry. The food is overpriced for how is tastes.  Overall, I think its the environment you'd enjoy more than what you actually would order. Never go here hungry, you won't be satisfied.   I would recommend this place, if its nearby, if you want to just grab a coffee or tea with a friend, and chat in a pretty environment. Besides that, nothing worthy, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Sorelle and co have delicious vegan cupcakes and other baked goods. I was surprised how fluffy and perfectly sweet the cupcakes were. i highly recommend the chocolate banana as well as the raspberry cupcakes. Most vegan baked goods I've tried were very sweet and the frosting overpowered the cake. But Sorelle and co have exceptional baked goods. I would have liked it if the cupcakes were cheaper as it is around ~$6 for one small cupcake with tax."}
{"text":"Good service and super cute decor. Vegan everything! Salad was really good! Not the biggest fan of their dessert as its vegan and tastes a little weird - but if ur vegan this would be the perfect spot for you!"}
{"text":"Lovely place to get together with the girls.  The seating area upstairs was full this Saturday afternoon, so we just ordered the peach cheesecake and the blueberry orange donut to go. I'm giving 3 stars for their mini cakes. Definitely IG-worthy... but I felt the flavour & texture was 1 dimensional.   The decor gets 4 stars. Definitely a place I'd recommend for intimate meet-ups and for special events. The pictures taken here would turn out perfect."}
{"text":"Oh the dessert is soo goood!! Glad there is a vegan bakery out there! It's a bit pricy but worth it once in a while!!!!"}
{"text":"A shop that serve vegan items and it included many desserts/cakes/cookies and hot plates.  The decor of this place looks quite classy, clean, and fancy. The staff are polite and friendly so first impression is very good. As soon as I stepped inside, there are many people in the line, a good sign. So we waited for a table and luckily, we got a table finally.  Since it's lunch time, we ordered hot plate. We tried the Mushroom soup, Lasagna, Potatoe Croquette, and a Kale/Romaine Lettuce Caesar salad. As these food are dairy free, meatless items, the final products are quite excellent. Better than I expected! :)  The Mushroom soup is light and filled with mushroom aroma, similar to the kind I have tried in Oliver & Bonicinni, but this one taste lighter, in a pleasant way of course. My guess is they probably use vegetable stock and this place after all, is meatless. I will have it again next time. But they also offer Minestrone soup as well which I havent try ... should i try that next time or should I stick with mushroom.. wish I have more than 1 stomach. :) A recommended item from me!  For the Lasagna, it's all veggie and vegan cheese. i don't know what they put in there but boy, its good!! another recommended item from me!  As for the potato Croquette, it is served with some kind of Apple sauce and also some white \"creamy\" sauce that have a little kick from the cayenne pepper (I think it's cayenne pepper). I dont know what's in the white sauce but it sure looks like cream sauce but I am sure they didn't use any cream as it's dairy free. I find that if you eat a small piece of croquette together with some apple sauce and the white sauce, the taste from the three blends together quite well, in my opinion. Another recommended item from me!   The Kale and Romaine Lettuce Caesar, .. well, its ok, nothing particular that I like or don't like. Unless you want some green to add some fibre to your diet, it would be a good choice. They also offer other salad as well. but if you have limited stomach space, skip this one.  Looks like my first visit to this shop is mainly hot plates and I haven't even tried their sweets items. I cannot leave this place without at least trying one!! So I tried their chocolate cookie and a cup of their brewed coffee at the end. It's good!! The coffee actually goes quite well with the cookie, but at that point, I was like 120% full and I have to stop, even though there are also other items I wanted to try.  One note though, the price is on the higher side for a typically lunch but it's worth it in my opinion. It's not easy to find a good vegan place that offer palatable dishes. I would pick this place over Rawlicious anytime whenever I want something light and with veggie. Again, just my opinion.  Another note, I think I saw another review mentioning upstair was closed due to private event, it also happen to my visit today. So i guess, private function is getting popular for this place on Sunday(?) so if you plan to visit this place, call ahead to check or there could be some waiting to do if you wanna dine in."}
{"text":"Opera cake was melted and all flavours had been melted together :( I told them and they did nothing to resolve issue. I really wish they didn't leave their sweets on the counter all day. Anyways the crinkle cookies are good, won't be comming back though."}
{"text":"Thank you, Katya and the Sorelle & Co team for the beautiful cake you made for our wedding! From the very start, I was on a mission to find a bakery that could make a nice wedding cake with clean, junk-free ingredients for a reasonable price. My husband and I liked Sorelle's selection. Katya worked with us to meet our needs. She even took the time to help us figure out the logistics of the flowers for decorating the cake, the cake topper and delivery to our venue. Not only was the final product a wonderful cake with natural ingredients, but also one that was beautifully decorated in line with the criteria we provided. It was a perfect fit for our theme. We highly recommend Sorelle & Co. We'll definitely be return visitors."}
{"text":"Found this place on happy cow, its pretty much the only vegan establishment in my area.  Their chocolatey goodness are so sweet and tasty, no sacrifice in taste whatsoever. Fancy golden decor. Friendly staff.  The only issue I had is that the place was crowded and there was no place to sit down, so make sure to find an empty seat before ordering. For take out orders consider this a 5 star review.  They do have a private room that was empty at the time, so if you are a group of four or more you might want to consider booking it.  They make custom order cakes. You will need to order one week in advance though. I looked at some designs and they are pretty impressive.  Overall delicious guilt free sweets and a great café. Can get crowded. Perfect for takeout orders."}
{"text":"went Sorelle for my bridal shower gathering.   an elegant place for girls gathering.  love their anitque style tableware.  food in general does not taste weird but it's a bit greasy, probably because it's vegan and gluten free.  their high tea portion is huge, i got a lot of leftover to take home."}
{"text":"10 Stars!! (Jumping up and down like a kid at a candy store for the very first time) I have literally found my heaven! GLUTEN FREE! Everything is GLUTEN FREE! Wait what I meant to say was... YES EVERYTHING HERE IS GLUTEN FREEEE!!! Holly Molly! I'm so excited  The decor is beautiful! The service was GREAT! The dessert selection was fantastic! And most importantly it tastes AMAZING!!  Nough said!  P.s 1 question; why isn't there a massive gluten free and vegan sign with confetti and balloons outside?? I don't get it! EVERYONE MUST KNOW! (For example family and friends of those who don't have these allergies and want to provide a very thoughtful   But don't know what you specialize inn )"}
{"text":"The place is so cute and perfect for girls day. Perfect for someone with diet restrictions."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and these treats came in the most gorgeous packaging. The donuts, cake, cupcakes and Nanaimo bars are visually beautiful and made with heart. The downside is that everything was incredibly sweet. Almost too sweet. Like, you can only take a bite or two sweet. If you have a REALLY big sweet tooth, Sorelle is perfect for you and you should try it out. We're glad we tried them, but probably will try their savoury items next time instead."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely gorgeous, yes.  Nothing you'd ever expect to see in Vaughan. My friends and I got here around 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon and the place was quite busy.  All the tables were taken but luckily one cleared as we were done placing our order.  Seating is on a first come first serve basis, so it's best to try and find a seat before ordering.  The table we got was right by the window and for some reason the window was open and it was 1 degree outside.  I had to keep my jacket on.  The 3 of us ordered the snickerdoodle cupcake and my one girlfriend got the coconut cupcake.  I also ordered a jasmine tea and my girlfriends got a smoothie and macchiato.  None of us were a fan of the cupcakes.  The icing was way too sweet.  We couldn't finish it.  It is perhaps because it is a vegan cupcake, but the cake was a bit hard.  It was edible, but just not what I am used to.  The tea and macchiato were delicious.    Probably won't come back as this was a far trip for us and we weren't too crazy about what we got. I didn't feel too hot after eating all that icing.  It is a great place for pictures though and a place to meet your girlfriends. There is also a private room, which is probably another experience in itself.  Great for larger parties."}
{"text":"I love this place so much although there is limited seating. I am afraid to come with friends on a weekend because they don't always take reservations and might be too busy to get a table. Regardless, the ladies that work here are amazing and so friendly. Love it!"}
{"text":"Such a cute, instagram-worthy place for brunch, and apart from the picturesque setting, the food there is quite delectable.  I have visited the Yorkville location before, and I must say, both are just as perfect. This location had two floors !  I would recommend ordering your food before you take a seat because there is limited seating so if you leave your seat it can get taken very easily, especially because of the lunch rush ! When you order your food they give you a little number coaster to take to a table, and they will bring you your food !  For a tea room, I must say Sorelle & Co had a lot of savoury options. I ordered the Focaccia and my friend ordered the hamburger. For dessert we ordered the cinnamon donut and brownie. We both really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"I went to their store in The Bay/Saks fifth avenue downtown, got a donut and a vanilla peach cupcake. Both are not bad for gluten free pastries, and what's more they were BOGO! I've always been allergic to dairy and eggs so I was delighted to discover this place! We need more places like this in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I found the service really slow just for a cup of coffee. I understand that it is a vegan cafe but not having the option to add milk to your coffee is a little extreme for non vegan customers. I've ordered their quinoa salad (which stated a variety of vegetables mixed in it) and I was disappointed at what it actually was (2 types of vegetables in a very small amount). Really gorgeous ambiance though."}
{"text":"Amazing treats! Brownies are divine! Breads are fresh, but must come early to ensure you get a loaf!  They are highly concerned with allergies and ensure that there is no cross contamination. Big allergies they avoid are: soy, wheat, dairy, peanuts, egg, sesame, and (I believe) corn. Will return again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is so beautiful! It is reminiscent of a Parisian Ladurée store in France.   Everything here is vegan, baked goods, sandwiches, soups and drinks.   Small quaint and pretty! Perfect for a quick stop or a lunch date with your girls.   I would recommend checking this place out!   I loved the cupcakes they were delicious and the chocolate cookies dusted with icing sugar were recommended to me by a friend. I took some home! And oh dear she was right! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Ever since I developed an allergy to eggs, dairy, and soy, it has been incredibly difficult to find good bakeries that serve 'vegan' desserts. I am so excited and happy that this beautiful shop opened up! I love all their chocolate treats and my favourite thus far has to be the tiramisu. It tastes just like an original tiramisu so I was quite impressed as I've had a hard time finding a good 'vegan' tiramisu since this dessert is dairy heavy.   I've been here here twice so far; first time I took my desserts to go since the place was so busy. The second time I came here for lunch on a Friday and was able to get a seat so I stayed in and had the portobello mushroom panini with a minestrone soup. I can't believe they included vegan cheese! Of course, it did not taste like what a real brie would, but it was good enough to satisfy my cheese craving (since I can't have any dairy).   This place is great for those who have allergies. You can choose any dessert and don't have to always ask \"does this have....\" I'm sure I can say this for anyone that has an allergy, that it is one of the most frustrating things ever when you always have to explain and list your allergies to your server and hope they get it right.   The building is gorgeous. I love the style and the service is great. I can agree with the other posts, that the food is on the pricier side but taste wise is fine. I think Sorelle & Co has done a wonderful job with keeping the taste and consistency of their desserts and is comparable to any regular dessert that would have been made with eggs and milk. So I would give this place a 4.5/5 only because I do wish the prices weren't so high."}
{"text":"This place is a girl's paradise! Everything about this place is so fancy and pretty. I had a chocolate cupcake with mint frosting. The cupcake was decorated with edible pearls and I couldn't resist not getting it. The cake was moist and soft and matched perfectly with the frosting. By itself, the frosting tasted like toothpaste, but not in a bad way.   I also got a latte. It was offered with soy milk or coconut milk only. I opted for the soy milk hoping I made the right choice. And I did!! It was one of the most distinctive lattes I have had. I still remember the taste! Also, the cup was huge.   I got a lemon tarte to-go. It was packed in a pretty box that I can probably reuse for some stationary. The crust was done well but the filling was a tad too sweet.   For the atmosphere, the price is definitely worth it. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for people with allergies. It is gluten free, nut free, dairy free, etc.  It is tucked away in a small shopping center, with free parking which is always a plus. I had the grilled cheese with vegetables and the side salad. The grilled cheese was good, I just wasn't expecting the vegan cheese to be so thick. The bread did not taste like gluten free bread! The dressing on the salad was amazing, it was a kind of balsamic I think. The portions were a little small, however. I also had the cinnamon donut, which reminded me of a churro!  The interior of the store is so cute, bright and airy! While walking up the stairs to the dining room, you can see into the kitchen while they are cooking.  This would be a nice place to have a lowkey bridal shower or birthday! We did not come during the 3-6pm high tea time, so I'm not sure how that works."}
{"text":"So good!!! They serve treats that you can feel good about eating! As someone who's lactose intolerant, it can be hard to find dairy-free desserts that taste good, but Sorelle & Co does it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends. We booked in advance for the high tea experience. Also an fyi, they require a deposit over the phone when making reservations.   The exterior of the cafe is cute. Like a little light teal blue house on the corner of the street. Inside it's modern and posh. With two levels. Lower main level is the open kitchen, bakery/cake display and a few customer seatings. Along the stairs there are glam glam disco ball chandeliers. Upstairs there is a open window private room, washroom and some more seats.   The plates and dishware were a very cute floral pastel colour Victorian Style. Along side with Golden Cutlery. They had a whole list of different type of teas. I choose Peaches & Cream. The tea leaves comes in the same floral ceramic dishware. It's placed on top of the teacup and you are required to pour hot water on top to seep the tea. There is also a choice of Coconut or Soy Cream.   Our savoury finger foods consist of mini cubed vegan grilled cheese, mini bitesize pizzas, lettuce pinwheel wraps, & some sort of tortilla spoon with zuchinni bell pepper salsa. They were all tasty, but I find the pinwheel texture a bit mushy.   The 3 tier dessert tray was so cute and pretty. Top was 2 types of cupcakes, Chocolate & Strawberry Vanilla. They were so very moist and tasty.   Second tier was strawberry and citrus jelly candies, strawberry lemon tart, and Chocolate S'more Tarts. The jellies were a bit sweet. Both the tarts are delish!  Bottom tier was Raspberry Sugar Cookies, Brownie Cookies, Donuts, and Blueberry Scones. I love all of them expect for the donut and scones. Donuts were a little dense and scones were a little crumbly and a bit dry. But I did try it with their in house jam and devon cream. So it was a bit better with the condiments. I especially like the raspberry cookies, the texture was really interesting and crispy.   Overall I love the experience and would come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Really cute place and smart use of a historic location. This use to be a post office and general store :)  When you walk in, you already get the summer tea time feel with the bright white interior and case laid out with beautiful pastries.   I like that they offer gluten free desserts so any one can really enjoy a treat here. They also have a rainbow colored cupcake where proceeds go to sick kids :) awesome!  I had a orange blueberry donut. I'm not big on sweets so this was 100% way too sweet for me. But I loved the flavor! Orange really paired well with the sweet dessert and I had a nice bittersweet cappuccino to wash it down.  It's a cute environment and I think I'd be happy to stop by again and maybe try something a bit less sweet :)"}
{"text":"Swanky Packaging. I feel like Mary Antoinette!  The mousse is too loose and soft. It tasty but so sweet it made us all sick!  Donut was delicious and soo pretty. It was pink. Good because my favourite colour!  Now I think, will I go back?   Yes!"}
{"text":"SUPER CUTE CAFE !!! Very cute layout, chairs and snacks. It's in a cute little house- it has a pastel theme to the store. It's great for Instagram pictures and a girls afternoon tea. They have a nice variety of tea and desserts.  You go in order & pay from the counter and they'll bring the food up to where you choose to seat."}
{"text":"Everything here is soy-free, vegan (dairy-free and egg-free), nut-free, gluten-free, preservative-free, sesame-free... This place truly is an allergy-person's heaven. I'm allergic to soy, eggs, peanuts, shellfish, and sesame. As someone who eats gluten and dairy, you can't even tell that these are gluten and dairy free.  I visit the Toronto location regularly. The staff are always friendly, especially Gabriela!  The pastries/desserts are always sweet and delicious, though I do have favourites. Not only do they taste good, the textures are lovely too.   Cupcakes: my favourite are the vanilla mocha, carrot vanilla, chocolate mocha, double chocolate, vanilla coconut. Why? They are all fluffy and moist, with creamy icing on top.   Muffins: favourite is the blueberry, apple, chocolate, and cranberry. Why? Fluffy and moist!   Cookies: chocolate cookie, and red velvet cookie. They are both chewy and sweet.   Brownie: all of their versions are good! Soft and fluffy,  somewhat chewy.   Some items of which I am not toooo fond are the donuts (I'm not fond of the texture, kind of spongy, and I find them too sweet), the loaves (banana and carrot; I find them somewhat boring), the chocolate chip cookie, and the eclairs (eclair had a strange texture).   Having said that, their menu is huge and I love pretty much everything else they offer.    I'm so happy Sorelle exists!"}
{"text":"Vegan, nut-free, soy-free and gluten-free. Bravo for making all that happen and still taste delicious. The chocolate crinkle cookie was amazing and I would never have guessed that it happened while missing all of those ingredients.  The service was very helpful and friendly.  This is a beautiful store that I know my child will adore. Thank you Sorelle for creating such a special place that children with allergies can enjoy with their friends and no one is left out."}
{"text":"This is one of the most aesthetic cafés that I've been to. My family and I rented the private room upstairs for 2 hours. The whole room was set up beautifully. The staff was friendly and checked up on us every once in a while. Most of the desserts were too sweet, but the small cheesecake and the smoothie bowls were delicious and filling. It's a perfect place to have a girls get together or bridal shower.   - the fake bouquet of flowers in the gold vase was provided by Sorelle & Co. We brought the other smaller bouquets ourselves"}
{"text":"Not all that it's chalked up to be.   The one thing I can say is the latte was fantastic, but other than that, this place ain't worth a visit (unless you want an Instagram pic with 100 likes).  I met my girlfriends here for brunch and I myself had a muffin and 2 lattes, but my friend ordered a soup and it took them over half an hour to bring it to the table. HALF AN HOUR.. for a soup. The service was downright embarrassing as you could tell the girls that work there are so over the customers that come in just for cute pictures. They don't smile, they don't guide you through the menu (which is confusing, by the way), and they don't care how long your food takes. When we brought it up with our \"server,\" she had to ask someone else who had to ask someone else how long the soup would take. For real? None of our food items were anything special, either.   My suggestion is go to the dollar store, pick up a cute mug, some marble wall stickers, and some turquoise planters, and make this a DIY Instagram post rather than making the trip here. That's basically all it is, anyway."}
{"text":"To preface this post, I have no food sensitivities or allergies. But I do make an effort to try products that claim to be respective of these issues. Overall, for what this business claims, it is okay by me. The taste is authentic in comparison to products that include nuts, soy, eggs, and milk. Although I will continue to enjoy products that do contain the afore-mentioned ingredients, I can assure you that those who choose to pick these products due to dietary restrictions aren't missing out on the real thing!"}
{"text":"Came here because the decor looked pretty. The tea I ordered was a green tea. It costed $6. It was not loose leaf green tea or anything special. It was a tea bag placed into a tea cup. It was over priced and did not taste like traditional green tea. There was not really any patties and baked goods left or available when we came, around 4pm... it's a bake shop so I assume there should be. Unfortunate that there was none & only had 1 cupcake available. The menus are weird. The menu we were given was only for food and did not have any drinks on it. You have to go to the front to read drinks menu. It's not a full service tea place. You order at the front, pay, and then they bring you your meal/food. It felt like we were in a more expensive Starbucks except more awkward since we were trying to enjoy ourselves but you have people walking in and lining up next to your table to buy take out. Overall, it was not the experience we were expecting. It fell short of what was expected and sadly will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not sure I picked the wrong item to sample on my first visit, but I thought the eclair was chewy and I didn't quite enjoy the taste. the capuccino though was excellent. It was also a busy weekend afternoon and we were seated by the cashier. It was a clean, classy setting so the buzz and people bumping into my table on their way out certainly took away from our first experience."}
{"text":"Surprised a place like this popped up in Vaughan! Great spot for a girls lunch. Apparently they do high tea which I would definitely try. Slightly expensive but on par with other similar establishments. Great place to go if you have dietary restrictions or are looking for a healthier alternative than the average cupcake."}
{"text":"Parking: Free - medium sized lot.  Venue: Small, just a few tables (4 I think, with seats meant for a couple/pair)  Washrooms: Single personal washroom (Male/Female), just like the type of washroom you would find in a home. This place has a nice \"home\" feel too it, even the exterior looks like a house.  Experience: Pleasant, I've tried the Mediterranean panini with the lentil soup. Small portion sizes and a premium price point (just to give you an idea you could buy an appetizer, main course and avocado shake at a Vietnamese restaurant for the price of their panini and soup combo). But you're getting fresh quality for the amount you're paying. The taste of the food stays in your mouth even long after you've left. Most items are vegan and gluten free.   Everything is decorated to feel like a French café, from the seating, table, utensils and tableware. If you're very nit-picky on a good setting to have a light meal, this would be the place to be."}
{"text":"The interior was beautiful and there was a wide variety of vegan options. I still dream about the pumpkin pie I had at Sorelle & Co. I would love to go again."}
{"text":"Thought I would check this out as they opened about 2 months ago.  Beautifully restored country home in an extremely elegant European fashion. A nice blend of contemporary and traditional decor; reminded me of an upscale hotel or Parisian cafe.  We were there Saturday at about 4:30 and the selection was quite limited; they sell out fairly quickly.  Had the nanaimo bar (very tasty but quite rich) and my girlfriend had a scone.  Friendly and attentive staff.  Would come back again but would aim to be there earlier for a better selection."}
{"text":"Located in a beautiful little house. This bakery delight is for those who have a glue tin intolerance. Their freshly baked goods are delicious. You can sit in have a pot of organic tea with a slice of cake. Everything is gluten free from fresh baked breads to slices of cake and pastries. The price point is high but then again you can't put a price on good food"}
{"text":"Amazing place close to the house. I was absolutely shocked vegan, gluten free and nut free everything. I took my niece from England she is a vegan and has a nut allergy.  I am gluten intolerant perfect for both of us.  vanilla cupcake good a bit dry Opera cake moist and amazing.  MOUSSE CAKE tasty with raspberries flavours  Red velvet donut baked not fried I think it was a cake donut. This one is to die for  Avocado toast lacked a bit of flavour but I added salt and pepper and it was then perfect.  All the teas were amazing.  We liked it so much we went again a couple of days later.  Grill cheese sandwich with vegan cheese and salad , vegan cheese can't believe how good it was"}
{"text":"Very pricey but great little vegan bakery!  What I especially loved was the building.  Apparently it was built in the mid-1800's, owned by Thomas Cook at one point and was also the home of the first Italian settler in Vaughan.  It was later restored by the Remington Group and is now a really awesome little bakery!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Sorelle for ages since there are so many amazing photos on Instagram. The staff are all very nice and I was surprised there was actually a high chair on the premises (with a tray!). We tried the Opera, chocolate cupcake and donut. Tried the Peach & Cream tea from Sloane. The aroma is amazing. Highly recommend this one.  Out of the little sweets, Opera cake was likely the best. I guess the price reflected on that. Overall it was a nice experience at Sorelle but I likely wouldn't try the high tea. It was $50 pp and the portions seemed tiny. Honestly, for me Sorelle is all about the presentation from it's decor to gluten free sweets. So if you're all about posting beautiful photos, etc. This is your stop but don't expect too much after that.   Great place to hang out and catch up with friends"}
{"text":"Finally, an all vegan bakery that's not hard to get to (ie downtown). I was so excited when I heard about Sorelle. It is an absolutely stunning cafe and everything inside is so fancy! It's quite large and they have enough space for a large display, a few seats downstairs, and more space upstairs for seating as well as large parties for an event.   All of their food is gluten free and vegan so it's great for anyone who has allergies! They have food like salads and sandwiches as well as treats and tea. They use Sloane tea which is absolutely delicious. They also offer high tea on weekends, which I am definitely coming back for.   I tried several treats as well as the peaches and cream tea. The tea was heavenly. They also sell tea in a package for you to take home. I think it's was around $18 for a tin. The lemon brulee tart was everything I could ever want in a lemon tart. The tart shell was crispy and delicious. It didn't even taste gluten free. The filling was lemony without being overly tart or sweet and had a bruleed sugar crust on top.   They had a blueberry vanilla orange donut as well as a chocolate raspberry donut that day. I was craving donuts so I grabbed both for home. The blueberry one I wasn't expecting too much as they told me the chocolate raspberry was popular. I thought it was hands down the best donut I've ever had. It did not taste gluten free at all and had such a lovely texture and flavour to it. I highly recommend this donut if you like those flavours. The chocolate raspberry was not for me. It did have a nice flavour and a bit of raspberry sauce but I could taste the chickpea flour and it tasted gluten free. I don't like the taste of chickpea flour and I think I just got a clump of it that wasn't mixed well, as I've noticed can easily happen. Happens to me when cooking at home. Anyways, unless you LOVE chocolate raspberry, I don't really recommend this one.   I also tried a coconut macaroon as those are rare to find totally vegan. I didn't really care for it at all. It tasted off, kinda like the donut, and you could tell it was gluten free. It just wasn't for me.   Overall, I was really impressed with Sorelle &  Co. I highly recommend checking it out if you are looking for a high quality experience with delicious food. I haven't tried any savoury items yet but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gluten-free, soy-free, vegan, nut-free and preservative-free foods.  The \"Sorelle\" sisters have really done a great job here and kudos to them.   Product wise and taste wise - really well done.  Ambiance and presentation - well above expectations and raises the ante for the neighborhood.  Price - high end, but in the same range as others in the same caliber.   The place takes a healthy approach to desserts while also maintaining the same technicality, dedication and presentation of traditional Parisian baking."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing atmosphere, very friendly and polite staff, nice music, awesome gluten-tree and not free stuff, had a very nice pizza and quinoa salad. The coffee is also good. I would come back again and again as the place is very relaxing and pleasant and the service is great!"}
{"text":"An all vegan restaurant! Absolutely delicious, but sometimes desserts can be stale, nevertheless beautifully decorated and great service!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing posts of this business on Instagram and I have been meaning to go and try it out. So there was a day we were in the area and had some time so we had dropped by. I must say this house beside a Rexall may look like an ordinary house from the outside, however inside it is BEAUTIFUL. I would definitely attempt to rent out the establishment based on the atmosphere alone.   Now as for the food and beverages, keep in mind this is my own opinion and doesn't mean that it isn't good for those whom enjoy. I have had gluten free / vegan friendly things before and really enjoyed them, however I was not a fan of the pastries at were made here.   I had gotten a crinkle cookie that I was so excited for and it bit into it and it was SOLID. Also it didn't have the best taste either (in my opinion). I will not get descriptive because its a personal preference.   The staff at this location were friendly, very knowledgeable. Again it is an OUTSTANDING environment, perhaps I might come back to try something else? I would come back for coffee !"}
{"text":"The place is indeed beautiful and the service is friendly.  I realize the place is gluten free and vegan, however, they need to OFFER CREAM for coffee as an option.  It`s not like it would hurt anyone and it would drive up business.  As it is now, the coffee is very weak (even their cappuccino`s) and when you can only have coffee with rice milk, almond milk or soy milk, it really ruins the flavour and enjoyment of coffee.  I would be there more often if it weren`t for the lousy coffee.  Step it up Sorelle!"}
{"text":"I walked into Sorelle today and was left utterly disappointed. The cute little cafe that has always been amazing for people with food restrictions/allergies has really started to let me down. The past few times that I have walked in I have been met with terrible service. Today I was 1 of 2 people standing in line and i was left waiting for almost 15 minutes because three employees were tending to a single customer. The employee organization and management really needs some serious improvement!"}
{"text":"You'll enjoy the decor but not the food. More to come!  Came twice in one week. Never again.   This is definitely a niche cafe.   Gluten free. Dairy free. Not sure what else they were advertising.   All deserts were dry and bland.   Lattes were also different. No regular milk. Just soy or coconut water I think.    Again, not saying this place is terrible. But it's definitely a place you want to visit because their menu fits your lifestyle/diet.   The place looks great. Looks like a Tiffany's cafe essentially.   Seems super popular with the neighbourhood but not sure why..."}
{"text":"I kinda knew I was going to leave a 3 star for this place before I even stepped into the store. We live 2 minutes away from Sorelle and I have heard mixed reviews from yelp and friends the last couple of months.   If I was a person with allergies, I would give Sorelle a 4-5 star at a heartbeat. I can understand how a person with allergies would appreciate the fact that an establishment of such exists in Toronto uptown. We really have to give Sorelle some recognition for their thoughts and hardwork.  Ambiance and decor are top notch. It is a perfect place for girls date and fancy afternoon tea. The renovations sort of reminds me of a knockoff version of Lauderee. But as a person who doesn't really have allergies or health concerns, I can tell you that their desserts don't taste very good and I am being very honest. Everything looked really pleasing to the eyes but the brownie, eclair and donuts kind of tasted like play dough and they all have a weird taste and texture to it. I want to appreciate and love this place but as a big foodie, I must say I am pretty disappointed.   Nothing really special about their service, the hostess wasn't rude but she didn't sound like she wanted to be there at all.   1 star for taste 4 star for food presentation 5 star for ambiance 3 star for service  4 star for price   As a foodie without any allergies, I would not recommend this place and would not come back."}
{"text":"Yorkville location: This is my favourite place to go! I live closer to this location than the location up north. For allergies & Food sensitivities this is your go to place.  The desserts look so appetizing! The lemon meringue tart is the best! Its too bad they don't have it everyday.  The apple crumble tart is just ok. The eclair was good. Prices seem in line with other dessert places.   Bought a cake for a birthday. It was not too sweet which is a good thing. It was soft & moist. The only problem is that I really didn't have much to choose from...the store only had 3 cakes made for that morning of which 2 were 4\" cakes!  The price for the cakes are a bit on the high side. $48 for a 6\" cake.   Had a soup & salad for lunch & both were good.   The decor is definitely my style. The plates, napkins & cutlery all signify elegance."}
{"text":"A cute little café and I can see how this place can be a quick favourite for the vegan and gluten-free crowd...but as a non-vegan who loves her gluten...I was incredibly curious how their beautiful pastries were being held together with no eggs and no flour. Magic? From pure cuteness?!   Walking in, you can immediately see a wall with a beautiful display, especially a tall, 7 tiered wedding cake display. As my friend said...'I just want to bring that home and look at it!\". The colours there are all pastel greens and pinks. It's set up to be an open seating, where we pay at the front and sit wherever there's space open. There's also a room that can be reserved for a larger party.  The pastries themselves are beautiful, and taste fine. My major disappointment was the actual food menu - in line with the GF and Veg, unfortunately that left salads and noodles. Otherwise a great place for a bunch of girls to chat and gab over a cup of tea (served on very pretty tea cups too). Me likey!"}
{"text":"Love finding gluten free and vegan friendly places!  We tried the:  panini bread: not bad and not super powdery like other gf bread, we freeze it and use is as garlic bread at home by drizzling with evoo and garlic - toasts pretty well  challa bread: I believe it is made with chickpea flour. I didn't love it. It is sweet like challa but still not like challa at all and I also didn't love the texture (super dense and heavy). Not bad toasted with some peanut butter but wouldn't buy again  date square: amazing. delicious. cannot tell it is gf. will buy again and again and again  carrot cupcake: also really good. would buy again  red velvet cupcake: this was honestly really not good for some reason. the cake part tasted weird and was gritty and dry and the 'cream cheese' frosting was goopy like snot and tasted horrible lol. this one went straight into the garbage.   raspberry scone: pretty good, a bit powdery but not bad. would not buy again likely but would still eat it if it was in front of me   Would love to eat lunch here one day and try more of their savory food! A must try for anyone who needs to eat gf or who is vegan!"}
{"text":"So far, the best place I've been to. Went here on a Tuesday evening with my friend. Everyone who works here is amazing and super friendly and polite. The decor is absolutely beautiful and sophisticated. Don't be fooled, you do not need to dress up. I went here with my leather jacket and did not feel out of place at all. Everyone was so welcoming. We both had the Blue Power smoothie (I had coconut milk, my friend had orange juice) it was the best smoothie ever. We ordered the pizza and avocado toast and I fell in love with their food right away. The spice, flavours were perfect. For dessert we had the maple tart, and a muffin. So amazing. We ended up buying some of their granola and a couple of treats for home!! Definitely recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Someone please explain this place to me because I just don't get it.  Saw this on a few friends' Instagrams and it looked like such a pretty cafe to check out. I came with a friend Sunday afternoon - the aesthetics of this place is really on point, and that's all you can say about this place.  So you go in, wowed by the decor, then realize they don't seat you and you have to order and be given a number, then you seat yourself and they'll serve you. Totally fine - there's about less than 15 tables spread across 2 floors plus a private room for events.   Anyway, they had a few donuts they were sampling, and each one tasted worse than the previous. Maybe I should forewarn you that I'm not vegan... so I'm not too sure if all vegan food tastes like this? But the donuts tasted like a mixture of cardboard and plastic dipped in sugar.   My friend and I were horrified by the donuts so we didn't even attempt to try the food even though it looked nice. We each just grabbed a drink - a soy London fog which was too sweet for me, and a tropical smoothie which tasted like half a lemon and a banana blended together. For about $5+/drink I'd say you are so much better off going to Starbucks - but hey you can get a nice Instagram out of this place if you care about that.  So so disappointed by this place and so surprised they recently opened up in Yorkville. I honestly don't know what type of customers come here on a regular cause this food is inedible. I feel sorry for vegans and your limited food choices."}
