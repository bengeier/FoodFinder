{"text":"Great place to go! Extremely relaxing atmosphere, hookahs are delicious, and employees accommodate to any needs! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The hookah here is very good and lasts about an hour. Which is pretty good compared to other ones in its area. The price is a lot different than I have ever seen. It is around $9 a hookah for one person and an additional $3 for each person smoking off that hookah. I want to say the price for a hookah refill is $5 but don't quote me. The time I went had a few DJs playing live music which I enjoyed. The place doesn't get packed early, its more of a place to come after hours."}
{"text":"I am a huge hookah smoker I usually spend most nights smoking hookah out of one of my own at home while watching Netflix. Though every now and then I like to go out and smoke but I have been in search for a super chill, not too loud, reasonably priced hookah lounge. Well let me tell you DEVILS HOOKAH is the place!!! I absolutely LOVE it it here, you know when you go somewhere and it is just like, \"yeah, this feels right, I like this\"... 
So.... The HOOKAHS are 100% by far the LEAST EXPENSIVE I have ever found, they are MADE to PERFECTION and charcoal service is periodic!!! Not only is the hookah great but the MUSIC is great, covers all genres and a GREAT NON REPETITIVE MIX!! 

*But wait, there's more.. They have FRESH PRESSED JUICES, that's right FRESH PRESSED which is a personal favorite of mine and it comes in the cleverest cup... So to sum everything up..... MUST TRY!!! It's is small but a gem ... Did I mention the owner is amazing, refreshingly professional with great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great hookah & soft opening specials. Would highly recommend anyone to check this place out."}
{"text":"PERFECT NIGHT STARTER OR CLOSER

The business does absolutely everything right, from the fun ever-changing upbeat music, absolutely great prices to the perfectly attentive service. The clientele can be a bit mixed, which makes it interesting. 

THE AMBIANCE

Blacklights, projectors over the DJs, music that'll let you carry a relatively normal conversation, and enough hookahs to go around. Very clean venue, short lines at restrooms, and really fun music that can go from old-school hip hop to the latest electronica/world jam. Switching back and forth from a relaxing state to a euphoric party-mode, just like a hookah bar should. 

THE FOOD

Very decent, so are the drinks.

THE PRICE

Extremely moderate, starting at around 9$ a hookah, there's no reason not to check at least one out, heck, at that price, go for a couple. I recommend the gummy bears flavor, and grape without mint. 

THE SERVICE

Attentive, quick, and extremely friendly. They will make you feel first-class every time. 

THE FIFTH STAR

I will give them the benefit of the doubt because it's a fairly new venue, and although they've wowed me for a few weeks in a row, I only wish they would turn the music a bit louder, kept menus available at all times, and added more back-rests. Other than that, can't be missed."}
