{"text":"This is the place to go for take-out sandwiches. There are lots of European products that you don't find in the large grocery stores. Wednesdays they get their bundt cakes which are delicious...I loved their smoke meat sandwich on rye, and the smoked turkey and cheese on egg bread is another favorite. Always, service with a smile and gentle word always makes the experience warm. Only one table for eating in."}
{"text":"Parfait pour le lunch! Sandwich fait sur place  à emporter ou petit coin pour s asseoir. Belle qualité de produits d Europe de l'Est à rapporter à la maison. Service chaleureux.  Une découverte à Rosemont!"}
{"text":"Ok.. this is the real deal folks.  If it's Polish or Ukrainian food you need... This us the place to go"}
{"text":"Best anything sammich ever - and so simple, potato bread, mustard and meat of choice - and the sausage is mindblowing. All meats are prepared by the deli and they make an amazing job of it. I'll tell everyone about this place like a start raving lunatic :D"}
{"text":"I used to come here and pick up a smoked meat sandwich as well as Milka European chocolates after my acupuncture sessions at College Rosemont up the street.  It's a Ukrainian deli and they stock many food items from Eastern Europe. The folks behind the counter are really nice and I always received friendly service. The place is very clean and you can pick up the usual Polish Wawel poppycake rolls as well as black current jelly which can be hard to find at other places. If you're in these neck of the woods, it's  good spot to come by."}
