{"text":"The frittatas are out of this world I got the sausage and potato it was amazing. You can tell everything here is homemade including their gigantic meatballs! The father and daughter duo are great and very personable. Loved hearing the great stories."}
{"text":"I just ordered a meatball sub and a pepperoni pizza. I am extremely picky with pizza. This is by far the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh hands down. Most pizza places are extremely disappointing, but Frittata delivers in every conceivable way. The sauce is unbelievable mixed with the cheese and pepperoni, it is perfection. My boyfriend is from North New Jersey and he is very picky about meatballs. The town he is from is primarily Italian so he knows a good meatball. He also thinks the meatballs are the best in Pittsburgh and are the closest thing he can find to his mother's meatball, which is a high recommendation and one he does not take lightly. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a truly authentic and delicious experience. He uses all locally sourced and fresh ingredients. Please try it out and if you like it go back on a regular basis. We want to be sure he stays in business and is successful. The owner is a very sweet man and a pleasure to talk to while waiting."}
{"text":"That's Amore!

A new pizzeria I tried.   The owner will is very friendly and will provide you interesting stories about their ingredients, 

I have tried a couple of items (their pizza and hot italian sub).   Many of their ingredients are local (cheeses, meats, etc...).   He named various vendors that I did not recognize (not from Pittsburgh).

Pizza - Hot Italian Sausage (made locally).   The sauce is lite and on the sweet side (a good compliment to the crust).   It has good flavor.   I usually stick my pizza back in the oven (I like to have mine well done)

Sub - Hot Italian Sausage with Peppers and Onions - this thing was great.   The bun contained the madness of the sandwich - please make sure you do the italian lean when eating this otherwise I recommend a body bib

The food tasted very good - Pizza had a good crust (not like some of the other pizzerias around).   The sub was overflowing with ingredients.

They are known for their Frittatas (they have variety).   I have not tried one but it is next on my list.

Price:  Pretty reasonable - Subs - $7 to 8 (great value), Pizza - around $10 (a good size / looks like a medium)
Service:  They do have a couple of tables so this is mainly a take out place but they are extremely friendly

Give this local place a shot.  It is in an obscure place (next to my favorite dry cleaners).


Overall - I know I will be back. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh or at least a tie with Mineo's.  Owner is chatty and will offer you a glass of homemade red wine if you come in before the pizza is ready for pick-up.  Seriously great."}
{"text":"Never had a frittata.  Never had any desire for a frittata.  But after visiting Frittata Mangia Italiano, I am starting to have second thoughts.....

This shop is located in a little strip mall on Route 8 in Hampton.  If you were looking for it and blinked just your right eye, you would miss it.  My eyes were both wide open and I saw it.  Glen is the nicest man in the world.  And he will keep you company while your pizza is baking.  He has a couple nice stories to tell.  So does his food.  He opened the business a couple years ago so he could make frittatas.  And sandwiches.  He started offering little pizza for folks with kids.  And before you know it, the pizza took over.

I got a pizza.  Pepperoni, black olives, oh, next time remind me to get green olives.  He has them.  The pizza went on a ride with me.  A couple more errands, a trip across the turnpike to home.  Heated it up for a few minutes in the oven and it was wonderful.

The crust is great.  Really great.  Makes for a nice sturdy piece of pizza.  Wonderful sauce.  And lots of cheese.  Would I get it again?  No, next time it will be the frittata."}
{"text":"I am not the self-proclaimed \"Pizza Snob\" for nothing! I've had pizza all over the US and it's hard to hold a candle to NY pizza and even NJ pizza! However, when I want pizza, this is where I go!

Mr. J spotted this place soon after it opened and being an innocent bystander of my exhaustive search for decent pizza in Pittsburgh, he suggested we try it. 

First off, this is a family-owned business and the owner is a retired US Marine. Skip getting your food delivered and take a few minutes to chat with him. He's a super nice guy and may even offer you some homemade wine....it's delicious, by the way.

The sauce and dough are homemade and many of the ingredients are locally sourced. I've had a hard time finding pizza shops that have meatballs as a topping, but FMI does! YAY! I prefer them sliced and they do it, no questions asked. The meatballs are homemade as well.

I really need to try their other items as the frittata and pasta dishes look amazing! 

Don't forget to grab a cannoli! They're also homemade!"}
