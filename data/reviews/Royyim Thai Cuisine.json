{"text":"Great service and delicious food! The salmon curry (can't remember the exact name) is especially amazing. It's clean and bright and a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Husband and I love this cute cozy Thai restaurant. The food was awesome, large portions, and good prices. Very friendly and convenient for us to order ahead and pickup on the way home from work!!"}
{"text":"We came to try new restaurant near my house and I'm not disappointed at all. Their food was so pack of flavor and great service too. I will be their regular customer for sure."}
{"text":"Nice, clean new family restaurant with beautiful background music.  The food was delicious!  Our party of four had the Drunken Noodle, Chicken Pad Thai (2 orders) and Panang Curry.  Each of us were very happy with our choices!  Our server was delightful and attentive and very interested if we were happy with our choice of heat.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice to see a new Thai restaurant open in the east valley. Very clean and friendly staff. I ordered spicy basil with chicken. Served very fast! Taste good!"}
{"text":"Really impressed -- all delicious dishes for myself, wife, and daughter.  A nice interior, quiet ambiance, and the owner/wife chatted with us for a bit... very nice.  I ordered a pineapple curry with chicken and asked for medium hot. It was fantastic: extremely well balanced flavors.  Their \"hotness scale\" was on the mild side, so just order a notch above what you might usually request?  We will be back regularly.  Always happy to find a new place like this."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here several times and every time it is delicious! Great service and clean. Love the yellow curry."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for lunch over the weekend.  We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai (hot) and the Spicy Basil with Chicken (Thai hot).  The portions were generous and the dishes were so delicious! We thought the spiciness was right on.  The interior of the restaurant is nice, casual and cozy and the service was extremely friendly and a very pleasant experience.  The people working there couldn't be any nicer.  One of the best Thai restaurants I have been to in the Valley.  I am craving it right now just thinking about my meal!"}
{"text":"When the chefs of my go to Thai place decided to open another extended family location, I was among the first to try (and 1st review!).  I am happy to see my favorite crab fried rice (real!  Not krab lol) carried onto the menu, but I was more delighted to see a few new additions which I plan to work thru future visits!

That said, hands down, the Hok May Talay = instant win!  It was a mixture of fish, mussels, shrimp and scallops in a red (?) curry sauce.  So no overpowering spice level for me (ordered mild), and I was pleasantly surprised by the burst of citrus flavor from the kaffir lime leaves floating in the broth.  Note to self, bring husband to return so I can order more than one dish!  :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and service very friendly. My wife had the green curry which she liked very much. I had the spicy basil which I found to be very flavorful. The portions were good size and we both brought small portions back home to snack on later. Prices are reasonable and what I would pay at my favorite Thai restaurant. After our meal we enjoyed chatting with the owner about various Thai dishes and flavors and how they vary in different regions. Overall a very pleasant experience for these two Thai food lovers. We'll be back to try other selections on their menu for sure."}
{"text":"I am always excited when a new Thai place opens near me as it's my favorite kind of food. Another plus is that door dash delivers! I got the drunken noodles and laab salad. Both were quite tasty! I'll definitely order again."}
{"text":"Got greedy and ordered a shitload of entrees. 

They were super effing yummy. 

Try the evil jungle princess chicken- ridiculous name, out of this world flavor. It's one of those things that Asians do, \"hey let's put a bunch of English words together and make it into a somewhat discernible phrase!\" 

Evil Jungle Princess Chicken.

Anyway. Good food. The place was on the smaller side. Price was a bitnexpe"}
{"text":"We had the Crab Puffs to start and I ordered Evil Jungle Princess (medium spicy) and it was super delicious - creamy and full of aromatics. My parents got the Crab Fried Rice and Chicken Pad Thai and were happy with their meals as well. We enjoyed the fast, friendly service, reasonable prices, and the portions are huge so I was able to take half home for tomorrow's lunch!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restraints I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. Great food and great service and so worth going to."}
{"text":"I ordered from here through Uber Eats - my Pad Thai was absolutely delicious and a large portion! I hope to visit the restaurant in person and try more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"I have always dreaded eating asian food in AZ, but this restaurant shifts that paradigm. This is the best Thai food I have had in AZ, Period. Absolutely deserve 5 stars on all front. 
Taste: everything had well balanced flavors, with good preparation. Like broccoli that is still crisp, garlic that infuses into the whole plate (garlic chicken), and curry that has such deep flavor profiles. Most places near here taste like colored coconut milk, not Royyim!
Freshness:  the chicken used tasted incredibly fresh and no chewy or gnarly bits. Again, most places near here have that old chicken taste (you know what I'm talking about) and always get a little piece that you have to spit out. Not Royyim!

I will absolutely be coming here a lot because their food reminds me of our travels to Thailand and their authenticity really shines through."}
{"text":"Extremely rude waitress. Artificial fragrance air freshener overwhelms the restaurant and bathrooms. Subpar food. Bright Lime Green walls gives off a cheap feel. 

The owner did not smile once. She demanded we sit in the corner under the TV. We instead walked over to another table. She then rudely told us we cannot sit there \"in case a big group comes in\". No group ever came. 

The pad woon sen was really bad, tasted of toasted sesame and did not have any oyster or fish sauce. Not authentic. 

The only positive things were that they used filtered water, which is rare at a restaurant in Arizona, and the place was very clean. 

Prices: $11 to $18. Overpriced for what you get, like most Thai restaurants in AZ. 

The curry was ok, nothing spectacular but a decent serving size. Even Mild was way too spicy for me. 

Due to the extreme rudeness of the owner (Asian lady), and the ridiculous air freshener smell, we will not return and DO NOT recommended at all. 

There are so many better Thai options in the East Valley. For example: in Tempe, Thai Basil, Tasty Thai, and Smile Lao Thai are way way better. In East Mesa: Thai Plates Cuisine."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I have ever had! This little gem is tucked away, but well worth it! I have eaten a lot of Thai food, and this will not disappoint! I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"This is going to be long, but necessary. We went here about a month ago because our neighborhood sent out a post saying their was a great new authentic Thai place. So, we had to go. It was delicious and the service was great. So, we went back tonight and had a terrible experience. While sitting at the table our 6 year old threw up. All water, no chunks, just clear water all over the table. I cleaned up the whole table with napkins, not wanting the employees to have to do that. A woman comes out and I explain what happened and tell her I cleaned it all up and put all the napkins on this one plate. She responds in a ride tone \"oh, so that's why you took the napkins off the table next to you\", I say \"yes, that's why I took those 6 napkins, I didn't want you to have to clean it up\". We move tables and she comes over to tell us there will be a charge on our bill for dry cleaning the drapes. We said \"oh, it got on the drapes, ok, no problem.\" She has someone else come put the bill in our table and walk away. It's a $60 charge, for a 2x3 inch area. So, my husband goes over to see the drapes and says he'll pay half. She says no, we can't do it because that whole side of the restaurant smells like throw up now. Mind you the 20 something year old couple sitting 2 feet away from us at that table is still sitting there and is confused why this lady is telling us this and causing such a commotion. They eat there entire meal there, because they said there was no smell and they proceed to tell us they won't be coming back either because of the way we are being treated. That woman employee then comes over and my husband says, it's sad it's playing out like this because we we're just saying how we we're obviously going to have to leave a big tip. He says we aren't paying the $60. She says the owner said they won't take half. My husband says we will pay our bill, plus $32.50 and we will leave. She says you can't leave, I will call the police. He responds, please call them. She says, no, I will really call them, he said please do. She went in the back and talks to a man in the kitchen. The man comes out and says we can pay the $32.50. Done. I just cannot get over the behavior of this woman, it was such a bizarre and unpleasant experience and it could've been 100% avoided.  She said it in front of my daughter who now feels bad for something she couldn't control and is worried because we are being treated like this because if it. Which breaks my heart. So, clearly we will never be back. She made a big deal that was embarrassing for our family. I felt we were treated unfairly."}
{"text":"Yummy thai food. Fantastic flavours and great service! Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of Thai food."}
{"text":"I tried the Red curry chicken ' hot' and it was really spicy but good. I wonder what Thai hot and the hotter one would be like. It was very quiet around 2pm. The lady who seemed to be the owner was very courteous and friendly. I will be back for sure to try other stuff and recommend to friends who like Thai food. Definitely a great addition to Thai restaurant scene in east valley."}
{"text":"I tried to find Kow-soi (Curry noodle) all around the place and finally I found it here. The taste is very authentic and rich.   I also love Pineapple curry and Crab fried rice. Need to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Panag curry was excellent! Coconut shrimp wonderful! Thai ice Tea was so refreshing!Crab ragoons were more of a 4 as the fried wrapper felt more baked and not as flavorful but the overall was excellent! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here and it was fantastic. Fresh food with amazing ingredients.
We order the scallops and yellow chicken curry. The picture say it all."}
{"text":"I tried Royyim on their first day open and it was absolutely delicious! I had the crab puffs (real crab meat!!!), chicken panang curry, and Hoh Mok. Everything was excellent! The Hoh Mok is a Thai dish you don't see on every menu! It is a mixed seafood custard curry and absolutely amazing! It is one of the pricier items on the menu, but I was able to get 3 meals out of it, so it was totally worth it! 

Thai food is my favorite and I've eaten at almost every Thai restaurant in town and can say that Royyim is one of the best!"}
{"text":"First time there since it opened four months ago. I like the chill vibe with the curtain and decorations. The server(owner) was friendly and attentive. I also like their simple menu and non fried tofu. Dunken noodle tastes great to me."}
{"text":"Ordered the Massaman Curry, Pad Thai and Garlic Chicken. Best Thai food I have had in AZ, maybe anywhere.  Best flavor I have found. Will be back.

Now just hoping the current cook stays and owners don't sell. The last 3 Thai restaurants I liked in Gilbert / Chandler seemed to change owners after a year or two and then the quality and flavor went down hill almost immediately."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic! Having lived in Bangkok for a couple of years I'm picky about Thai food. This is the real deal. 

We hit it up for lunch and enjoyed the food. Good service, clean restaurant, menu was a bit limited - but they're just getting started too."}
{"text":"I lived in Bangkok for 4 years.  This is the best, most authentic Thai food I've eaten since living there.  Delicious food and delightful service.  I'll come from Texas to eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Got take out delivered by Uber eats. Everything was fresh, hot and super yummy. Great yellow curry"}
{"text":"I just learned that they opened two weeks ago!  It seems very expensive for Thai food.  We had the chicken satay appetizer, that should be named, \"chicken Satay Lettuce Wraps.\"  They were good, but the chicken was tough.\"  The Pad See Yew was good, but only had three small pieces of broccoli. I love Thai food!  This was good, but overpriced."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Royyim based on the great reviews on Yelp. We went on a Wednesday night. We got there around 8:15pm. The restaurant was absolutely empty, we were the only ones who dined in until close at 9. 

The place is very clean and the decor is pretty. We looked over the menu and chose veggie egg rolls for our appetizers, Pad See Eww and yellow curry, chicken. The food came out pretty quick. Everything was super hot and fresh. The spice level mild was pretty good for me. My husband always chooses medium at every Thai restaurant and he said his was not as spicy as usual. 

We both enjoyed our meal. The portion size for the chicken is very generous, I had to ask my husband to help me finish it. The chicken curry is less sweet at this restaurant than some of the other Thai places I tried. I personally prefer the sweeter version. 

It seems that we were served by the owners. The lady was nice and attentive and very welcoming. Even though they close at 9, they received a call for a takeout order at 8:45pm and they were happy to serve the customer. We left at exactly 9 and as we were leaving, the gentleman who ordered arrived. Many restaurants close their kitchen about 1/2 hour or more prior to close but this doesn't seem to be an issue for Royyim (for takeout I'm assuming). 

For our meal with no drinks, just water, our bill was slightly over $30. A nice restaurant with a beautiful ambience, good food and service."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and then realized we had 30 minutes to spare before we had to be at an appointment. We decided to sit down and eat and were told we were not allowed to sit down and eat because we ordered take out and we needed to leave.  I tipped 20% because I knew we were staying and the place was empty and we were still asked to leave. Food is great , but we are NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Quality place. Cozy and nicely appointed interior. Exceptional server - friendly and attentive. Food was very good. Excellent menu choices. Enjoyed mixed veggies and shrimp as an entree & the coconut shrimp as appetizer. Selected mild spicy - still had a slight kick to it ... just enough. A most pleasurable experience. Please check this place out and as the name Royyim suggests, you'll be smiling too."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant was very good. Nice atmosphere. Great service. The food was delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"You have to try the Garlic Edamame! I am going to keep coming back just for that! Blew my mind. It's hard to believe no one else has ever done that! After that had some steamed dumplings- pretty good. Will be back for sure!! I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic with gluten free options!! My husband and I found this place in yelp and decided to try it. It was amazing!!!! We will definitely be going back! They have a menu that caters to anyone (gluten free, vegan) and as a gluten free person it is a large selection and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Drove by the first time on a Sunday and unfortunately they were closed but kept in the back of my mind and I'm glad I did.  Fantastic food for take out, my wife raved about the green curry and the Tom kha though different than usual was very delightful and delicious.  The biggest bonus though is that my kids actually ate more than white rice and chicken, devouring he cashew chicken quickly and with happy smiles in the end."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today This was by far some of the best Thai food I have ever eaten The prices were very reasonable and the staff were so accommodating and very friendly We will definitely come back for a visit"}
{"text":"super great food! great prices for the amount of food that you get. we got the crab puffs and garlic edamame to start (HIGHLY recommend). then I got the crab fried rice for an entree and loved it! I got a whole lot of it too, so there's leftovers :) other good entrees are the evil jungle princess and the pad see ew!!"}
{"text":"My first visit here.  I love Thai food and this was Good!  Great service !  I'll be back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious Thai food, this is your place. It is AH-MAAY-ZING! We have eaten here twice now. The first time I ordered my food 'hot' and it was way too spicy for me, but it was so flavorful and delicious that I ate it anyway. This time I ordered it 'medium' and it was perfect. Everything we have tried is FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"My husband and I are very picky when it comes to Thai food and finding a good place is challenging. To make things more difficult I'm vegetarian and he is not. We are blown away by Royyim and I'm not bashful in saying I went there 3 times in one week the first time I tried them. The flavors are so authentic, deep and rich and the owners so friendly! My favorite dishes so far are the yellow curry with tofu and pad thai. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The crab fried rice was amazing with so much crab on top and great for the price. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best Thai Food I've ever had. Just like home cooking everything made from scratch and the flavor shows that. Good price and friendly service"}
{"text":"Very nice cozy place , we ordered tom yum soup and pak see ew along with pineapple fried rice . Food pretty  decent the waitress is nice will be back !"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place! Since my husband picked it up three months ago we have been back several times and have never been disappointed. Our kids love it, they normally get the cashew chicken, pad se ew (sp?), or soup and they are 9, 7, and 2. So easy to get them to eat the veggies! Absolutely cannot go wrong with the green curry. My husband recently went vegetarian and this makes it easy to eat out."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Wonderful service, charming atmosphere and really delicious. We are very particular about Thai food and prefer authenticity over the standard pan-Asian style restaurants that are common in the East Valley.  We had the spring rolls, Thai fried rice, chicken panang and the eggplant with chicken. Everything was amazing, especially the eggplant with basil."}
{"text":"This place is seriously great! First timers - went for the to-go order which rarely ends up being a positive experience..... but the food was delish! We will for sure be back. We are so happy to have a great Thai restaurant in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!!! My waitress was great and presented great customer service. I got a plain Jane house salad so I thought!!! It was amazing I even took some of the dressing home that was made fresh! My yellow chicken curry portion size was HUGE AND AMAZING. My family and I will be back ASAP. Thankyou so much Royyim cuisine for the great quality food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Red Curry! So clean tasting. I've tried a lot of red curry and this spot might top them all."}
{"text":"The best Chicken Noodles I've had!  Chicken was tender and just the right flavor.  Gif was hospitable and friendly.
Good Luck Royyin in your new home!  We will surely bring all the family in over the holidays."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise and flavor: Garlic Edamame.  Salty and sweet 

Spicy Basil with chicken served with a side of rice

Thum Ka with chicken served with rice.

Serving sizes are generous and plenty to share btw the 2 of us.  

This is an easy and typical meal that you Wil sure enjoy.  We'll definitely come back for more for the authentic Thai. 

Spent our Christmas here for dinner and it was a nice change of cuisine.  We enjoyed shrimp curry, crab fried rice( their signature dish),  crab puffs, tam yum,  potstickers.  We had plenty of food and savored every bite."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this Thai place that opened in my area, but sadly it was not very good. 
I ordered the orange chicken (which is what I order every where) and it was very basic.
My husband ordered the spicy basil. His was ok. Good quality steak but the flavors were bland. 
If your looking for good Thai in Gilbert, I would recommend Tum Nak Thai on Power road."}
{"text":"Well there are a lot of good reviews on here this place  is  not as good as everyone is saying. The food had a perfume taste to it, meat was tough. Regardless of food the people were nice and curtious."}
{"text":"I always love to try new restaurants when they recently open to see how well they perform and the quality of their food. My daughter and I recently went in to Royyim and found the ambience to be quite nice for a strip mall restaurant. Very clean and had a nice flow. The menu is limited but the choices are all your main favorites. I personally have a coconut allergy so it is often times difficult to each at Thai restaurants. I ordered the Kao Soi Gai, however when it came to the table I could smell the coconut in the dish. The ingredients on the menu did not state it had coconut so I had to send it back. Maybe my fault for not asking, but I did see coconut as a listed ingredient in other menu items so I think they should have listed it. No harm no foul, they brought me a hot plate of Pad See Ew and it was an excellent dish. It's a nice twist to their recipe, I think they use some kind of wine vinegar in their sauce so it gives their flavor a nice zip. My daughter had the mixed vegetables with chicken and tofu and really liked it as well. I grabbed a take out order to go for home, but she didn't like the vinegar taste in the drunken noodles. They wouldn't let me substitute the green bell peppers for anything else only omit them. Don't really think that is a good thing and that is why only 4 stars. If someone doesn't like a certain ingredient, they should be able to substitute for another ingredient, take a page out of any pizza restaurant's book.   Other than that, my daughter and I really enjoyed the flavors and the meals overall. We will go back"}
{"text":"Very clean and very nice people, enjoyed my Beef Penang- THAI HOT, very good, worth trying out."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, service and great pricing... If you like Thai food, this place is a must....."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  There were only 2 other people in there when we arrived for lunch,  we were seated in the corner under the tv.  No music was playing,  there was pictures propped up with the price tags still on , no lights were on.  It was quite odd.  Then on to the food.  I got Pad Thai like I always get.  It came with a salad and egg roll.  The salad was the only good thing.  The egg roll was crunchy with a mushy middle like there were mashed potatoes inside..  still wondering what the filling consisted of??? ..  Pad Thai was mush, no flavor, chicken was dry and rubbery .  Didn't eat it at all.  Waiter came  by and asked what was wrong and I told him it was not good .  He said ok and walked away.  Not asking if he could make me something else or anything.  Then he came back with the bill... no discount , just said I'm sorry this is how we make for everyone and was appalled when I asked for a discount.  He gave me a 15% discount .  $1.50 off ..  really?!?  I will not be back.  Horrible customer service , and horrible food."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Very fresh and flavorful! We always get delivery via Uber eats and it's always delicious and on time. Our favorites are the basil chicken and the garlic edamame (the BEST!)."}
{"text":"First visit - I came here with my parents. They ordered the pineapple curry and the chicken noodles, and I got Thai basil with chicken. All three were delicious. The veggies tasted fresh and the meat didn't seem at all pre-frozen, it was authentic. Even though I ordered Hot, the flavors really stood out.

Apparently they just opened up two weeks ago, and this is their first location and opening. I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"We went in at the dot of 5 p.m. yesterday and were the first customers. Very pleased with almost everything, cleanliness, a simple but attractive décor, and the food was terrific and of great quality. The coconut shrimp appetizer was not something out of a frozen box. It was hot, crunchy and delicious and made to order. My Better Half had crab fried rice with real crab and I had drunken noodles with tofu. All ingredients were great quality and the servers were very courteous.  Tab for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer with just water and 1 diet soda was about $33, a fair price for the quality of the food. We had one disappointment in that there is a homemade sweet and sour sauce which comes in a very small serving listed as a side for $1 and when Better Half asked for more we were charged another dollar. This seemed nit picky to us. This place is a very good addition to the area and we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This was my wife and I second visit.  This visit three of us went for dinner.   We ordered penang curry, crab pad Thai, and a vegetable stir fry, appetizers were garlic edaname, and pot stickers.  The food was
Excellent!  Service was great!  Definitely would come again!  I hope the community supports this place.  We need more great places to eat in the east valkey."}
{"text":"We just happened to come across this restaurant while shopping in nearby stores.  We HIGHLY recommend it as the food was AWESOME!  The people were very friendly!  The place looked clean with an appealing atmosphere.  We shall return!"}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas and was surprised how busy it was! Once I tasted the food I understood why, you really can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I ordered the pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the fried garlic pork was amazing. Our waitress was super friendly as well. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food, good atmosphere and stellar service.  Why only 4 stars you ask?  Easy...overpriced.  While the food is awesome, it doesn't warrant the hefty prices.  Definitely worth at least a visit."}
{"text":"Greasy weird Rangoon that O couldn't eat. The curry was the worst I've ever had. The service was inattentive. The Thai tea was diluted. It was a waisted $20."}
