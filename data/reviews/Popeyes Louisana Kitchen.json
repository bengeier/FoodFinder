{"text":"#179  I have been to all the Popeyes in Calgary but this is probably my favourite since it has tons of parking. Being part of the business park on Aviation Boulevard is a huge advantage even though there is a Starbucks, Subway, McDonald's, and other restaurants near by.  I have loved Popeyes since moving before moving to Canada seven years ago and was so glad they came here (now, I need Texas based Whataburger and California based In-N-Out to make their Calgary debut; hell, let's throw in Chipotle as Vancouver is too far to go (speaking of Vancouver, how about JJ Bean, Mink Chocolate, and True Confections open up in Calgary?)). Sorry, the chickeny goodness got me all flustered.  So, why only 3 stars you  ask? Here we go!  Let us start with the good:  -the chicken (spicy is the best) is always freshly cooked and the breading (for me) is just utter perfection  -the best mashed potatoes and gravy  -the corn on the cob (when in season) is the buttery goodness I miss from living in the American south (KUDOS)  What's bad (and hence the 2 star deduction) and this is a sin against humanity (okay, that's dramatic but if you had the macaroni & cheese two years or more ago, you would be waving this flag, too):  the macaroni & cheese (something has changed in the last year or so and at all the locations) is horrible (it's like they went el cheapo all of a sudden)  All locations have the standard coke products with refills. The stores are clean (at least every time I have been). The drive thru is always busy (which is why I always go in :) ). While the other two locations have very limited parking, this one has ample parking (as previously mentioned).  So, with 3 stars, will I go back? Yes, as long as the chicken, mash potatoes, and corn on the cob hold up (I guess I have to find a new place to get good macaroni & cheese with a generous portion at a fair price (help a brother out, please))."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant chain out and was impressed.   Service was fast and friendly. Decor is modern inside but not a lot of seats.   Pricing is on the high end for fast food or quick service food as it's called now.   Had the two piece chicken combo with corn bread and fries.   Chicken skin is decent not KFC but food was very hot and fresh. Chicken tenders and shrimp looked good but didn't have it.   This is the newest location in Calgary and it is very busy during the lunch rush at 11:15. There is a drive thru here too.   Overall if your a fan of chicken can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So I was on my way to a workout class, and I thought what better way to fuel my body than with fried chicken? lol See, there's no Popeye's near my house, so I don't get to eat it often, and I figure any time I'm near a location I NEED to get it. It's a requirement. Hell, back in the day it was a rule in our family that we would always run and get Popeye's at the Dallas and Houston airports between connections. My husband has nearly missed our plane more than once doing that - running to the gate after the final boarding call holding a bag of southern chicken! I'm sure our fellow airplane friends thought we were nuts. But it's just that good dammit! I always get the spicy fingers. I've never even had the bone-in kind yet. I love how crispy their coating is, and the spice is so nice! They use high quality chicken, too - this is not the pre-chewed crap that's inside McNuggets. It's real strips of chicken breast, and you get a good quantity of chicken every time. I also LOVE the biscuit. Always ask for honey to go with it, cuz that's the only way to eat it. I've tried most of their side dishes, and I think I like the mashed potatoes best. The mac and cheese is ok, my hubby likes the beans and rice, the fries are just ok, and I've never had the onion rings. So although I ate all my calories prior to burning any off at my exercise class, it was SO worth it. And please, Popeye's, don't open a location any closer to my house cuz then I'll have to eat it more often!"}
