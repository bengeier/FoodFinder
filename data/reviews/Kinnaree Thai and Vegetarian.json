{"text":"Have ordered delivery from this place 4 times now and I am blown away by the service, the food, and the overall experience of kinnaree. Each time my girlfriend and I have ordered from this place we received our delivery order within 20 min! The food is outstanding and the delivery drivers are extremely friendly. If you live on the westside of Vegas I strongly recommend this place you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"The service - the food everything is done extremely well - food delivered timely- the $$$ is great for the amount and quality of the cuisine - we had the Pad Thai and the Tom Yum soup - both were delicious the soup was a spice level of 8 and It was as good as anything I have had in Thailand - a great experience."}
{"text":"Must go!!! Spicy basil chicken is what brings me back here for the third time! Delicious. The eggrolls are light and not too oily. 
The food is consistently good and the service is polite and quick. I highly recommend  this place!"}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier to find the service and quality of food at Kinnaree... and I say that after noticing how a once great vegetarian Thai option, Komol, was not the same after a staff change. A search for the missing ingredient led me to Kinnaree where the old welcoming front staff, and the talented cooks are now found. 

Service is very friendly and informative. Everything done with a smile and good humor.

The food is excellent and well spiced. Solid range of top tasting options (meat and vegetarian). My favorite dish, Lad Na, is the best in the valley... overjoyed to find this cook again!

There is a sister post on Komol's site that agrees with many others about its slide in standards, and advises those with a similar sense of loss to find what they have been missing at Kinnaree."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant because of the vegetarian menu! We were told that they even separate the cutlery and the pans when preparing the veggie dishes!
The food is delicious, the waitress is super polite and helpful. Reasonable prices, delivery option.
Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok, what's not to love about this place? Fast deliver, great food, and delivery fees are minimal. My favorite foods are the crunchy shrimp, yellow curry ,and the shrimp fried pineapple rice."}
{"text":"The Curries are delicious, friendly service, decently priced, and extensive vegetarian menu. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Overall it was alright. The fast delivery was awesome. I'm half Thai so my taste is often discerning with Thai staples. So I opted to try one traditional Thai plate and a not so traditional one. Their tofu pad Thai was slightly lacking in flavor. The pork in the Chinese broccoli and roasted pork was a tad dry. Sticky rice was stale. And boring egg rolls. :/ the cost was basic for most Thai/Chinese delivery. Unfortunately I probably won't order from here again. I need more pizzaz in my food."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant with a separate vegan and vegetarian menu with just as many options as their standard menu! Tasty, spicy, and simply delicious!! Great place to visit especially with friends or family who meat and the like. Oh, and great portions with prices that will not knock you out of your seat like some vegan spots!"}
{"text":"We have visited Thailand many times and love the food.  So, being new to Las Vegas, we began our standard search for good Thai food a few month ago. We found this restaurant when we were looking for something closer to home. We are not vegetarians and wondered if we might be disappointed as many of the reviewers spoke highly of the veggie offerings but not so much about the food for we carnivores.  Well, we certainly were not disappointed.  The food was probably the best Thai food we have had outside of Thailand and we have tried many restaurant in Las Vegas and around the world. The Tom Kha Kai soup was the best, and the Pad Thai and Green curry did not disappoint and all came spiced as we asked.  The meal was also served with optional spices to add if desired, which is a much appreciated touch.  The service was outstanding, the price was very reasonable and we will be going back."}
{"text":"Kinnaree is the West Side Komol, literally. Our favorite server from our favorite Thai spot in Vegas opened her own place on the west side and it is fantastic. Living near UNLV, obviously Komol is a lot closer, so going out of our way for a meal at Kinnaree should speak for itself. 

We get the mushroom tom kha every time. Its creamy coconut and lemony freshness goes perfect with a side of brown rice medley. 

My girl gets the yellow curry entr√©e while I opt for the sesame chicken and we both share the pad kee mao with tofu. 

Other reviews are spot on when they say to over order. This is a must. The food is absolutely amazing. Sample as many flavors as you can, the leftovers hold up well on the reheat. 

I must also reiterate the fact that the owner of Kinnaree was at one time the best server at Komol, so good service is practically their mantra here. The dining room is also very clean and comfortable. The quality of the food earns 5 stars alone. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious fresh food. Every single time. Very friendly, knowledgeable staff, they get to know you and your likes/dislikes. Wonderfully accommodating. We are vegan physicians and they do delicious heart healthy like no one else- and we've been former regulars to quite a few more famous thai places in town. Also, our non vegan friends are totally comfortable with eating here!!!This hidden gem also has great, comfortable, and romantic/warm ambience. It truly is a pleasure for us to eat there and we do it several times per week. Oh, yes, we've also been pleased with delivery, but it's so much more fun to go there. Really pleasant people."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai cuisine. Lots of vegan friendly options at a reasonable price! Have brought several friends to this restaurant for their first Thai experience and they all loved it."}
{"text":"I've been to most of the Thai resteraunts here in Vegas and was surprised to see that by far the best one was this hidden gem. I've tried a variety dishes but the ones that stuck out were Panang Curry Chicken and Papaya Salad. The curry sauce flavor was extremely delicious and your tongue can taste every morsel of flavor.

For my dessert I had fried banana with ice cream and words are impossible to describe how rich it was.

Service was beyond excellent, refills were quick along with a smile and was very courteous. Other thai resteraunts tend to be hit or miss. 

I"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 instead of 5 stars only because I wasn't a huge fan of their red curry with tofu, and that is my favorite dish I always order at Thai restaurants to compare them all.  It wasn't bad though....just kinda \"mushy\" (it may have been because they put eggplant in it....i hate eggplant and it is usually not in red curry).

However, their crab rangoons and fried tofu were both incredible.  my friend and I ate ALL of them, even after they were already cold (they were even good cold lol).  We may or may not have been a little high but that is besides the point :p

Also got some sort of soup which was good but had a giant mushroom in it that freaked me out a bit.

Delivery took some time but the guy said it was his first day...he was very apologetic and nice.  I can't judge because I get lost everywhere I go...I couldn't imagine being a delivery driver!

Next time I order, I think I'll just order like 3 orders each of the fried tofu and crab rangoons, and send myself into an imitation crab/soy/deep fried food induced coma, only to wake up 3 days later craving more.  mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"LOVE this place... far more than any other thai i've tasted so far here in vegas. Their curry is nomz & my son loves their orange chicken. xoxo"}
{"text":"Best delivery Asian food I've ever had!!
Sweet and sour tofu was the best Vegetarian  entree I've had. Hands down. BBQ Pork fried rice and orange chicken were fantastic as well. GREAT HANGOVER CURE."}
{"text":"I had the duck curry (Heat: 7) and green papaya salad (Heat: 5).

Green papaya salad had excellent flavors and came with two shrimp. The shrimp were not completely cleaned. Looks like they were cleaned, but there was some leftover intestinal crap, as if they cleaned the shrimp carelessly. 

The duck curry was superb. The curry was rich and creamy. Tasted almost exactly like Lotus of Siam. The duck on the other hand, could have been cleaned slightly better. There were some very chewy, almost inedible parts. The flavor on most of the duck was good though.

I will echo the comments of other reviews and say that their spice level is very mild. The level 7 curry tasted fairly mild.

Even though this review sounds harsh, I will definitely be back. Food was excellent and I was being extremely picky."}
{"text":"Really great Thai food!!! Highly recommended- they have a full vegan/vegetarian menu! I had the Pad Kee Mao (with tofu) it was awesome!! Our server was so friendly and had a nice conversation with us!  My cousin had a spicy curry soup with shrimp, she said it was really good too- if I return to Vegas I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I am an occasional user of Yelp, but have been a free-loader until today.  Kinnaree is so good in every way that it even got lazy ole' me to get off of my butt to write a review.

I first went there about three months ago and have returned more-or-less weekly since then.  I love Thai food and have tried almost all of the options in Las Vegas.  This is now my favorite Thai restaurant outside of Bangkok (tied with one in SF).

Kinnaree has two menus, one for meat-eaters and the other vegetarian.  I have tried many of the options on both menus and what's notable is that everything that I've tasted is quite good (if not terrific).  In most places, my normal MO is to find a dish that I really like and keep on ordering it.  However, it is a fun challenge here to keep on trying new items until I find one that is so-so . . . I'm still waiting to be disappointed.  My favorites here are the soups, the curries, and -- especially -- the Steamed Seabass with lemon juice.  The Seabass comes with a super-tasty medley of veggies.  Baby doll!

The location is what scares me (from the point of view of Kinnaree's success):  it's in just another strip-mall on Sahara.  I'd guess that this restaurant will rely on word-of-mouth and positive reviews in order to thrive.  On the inside, though, it is comfortable and lovely.

The staff is wonderful.  The woman who is in charge and her assistant are both charming Thai ladies.  Their English is better than fine; but what's notable is the combination of their hustle and their charm.  If I were a single man, they'd be a big reason to choose Kinnaree.

In summary, this place is excellent.  I hope that you will give it a try.  If you do, I'll bet that you return often, as I have."}
{"text":"The herbal salad is off the charts.  As well as the pineapple fried rice....so flavorful.  I cant wait to go back.  Nothing fancy, but clean.  Attentive and fast service.  Made for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I usually look to Yelp to figure out where to eat.  Usually, Yelp never steers me wrong...but this time it did.  Badly!  I saw the great reviews for this place and decided to give it a try.  Extremely disappointing.  Not sure what the good reviews are for.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing or maybe it was an off day for the chef but it was pretty horrible.  

My husband and I ordered some fried wontons to start.  These were probably the only good thing about our food.  There wasn't really a whole lot of meat in there but the sauce it came with and the fried part was good.  For our entrees, my husband and I ordered our go-to dish: Chicken Pad See Ewe.  Ugh!  The reviewers that said the pad see ewe was great must be on something or have no taste buds.  My husband and I agreed it was probably the worst pad see ewe we've ever had.  It was totally dry and flavorless!  Barely any sauce.  It was like it was an old batch of pad see ewe that had been made in the morning and then they just reheated it in the microwave.  Either that, or the chef overcooked the hell out of it...so much so that it sucked all the sauce (and all the flavor) out.  It wasn't even steaming hot like how I usually see fresh pad see ewe come out to me.  It was barely warm.  The chinese broccoli looked old and wilted.

The only reason why I didn't give 1 star is because the service was good and our waitress was really nice and pleasant.  Also, they serve fountain sodas (which I like) instead of soda from a can like how I usually see at Thai restaurants. 

If you like meat and you like your food to have flavor, then don't eat here!  Maybe this place is just good for the vegetarian food.  What we got was pretty awful.  From now on, I'm sticking to Thai Style Noodle House.  Bigger portions, better prices, and better tasting food!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came across this place, thanks to Siri, when looking for a vegan restaurant. It is very close to home and we now go twice a week! Every dish that we have tried has been delicious!! The prices and the staff can't be beat. Love, LOVE the Pad See Ewe and Tom Yum Soup!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have tried most thai restaurants in Las Vegas   Kinaree  is new and the flavor is always very good  the desert fried banana with ice cream is awesome"}
{"text":"Kinnaree is the best Thai place in town now. They have the best vegan Papaya Phad Thai, Green curry, Glass noodles, Penang curry.. The list goes on. The service is impeccable!! 10 out of 10 for this place! Go Kinnaree"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken fried rice and seafood soup & noodle as a delivery. My bf got it and told me about taste.
Fried rice was just okay but soup&noodle was delicious. :D I'll try other one too next time."}
{"text":"My second time in. This time ordered the Spicy Basil Chicken lunch. Got it at a 6 level out of 10. Perfect for me. Enough to wake up the sinuses but not harmful to the mouth :-). Highly recommend. Great service too."}
{"text":"Just read up on Thai food westside, and decided on Kinnaree because my husband wanted orange chicken. I am so glad we did. It is a cute and very clean restaurant, and the hostess was friendly, informative and quick to serve us. I had a vegetarian salad called herbal salad, and it was delicious, though I am not a fan of fried tofu and it was a little heavy in the salad. The ingredients were crisp, fresh, colorful and very nicely sprinkled with good basil and mint. The dressing was fantastic. I am certain that the papaya salad would be the same. Orange chicken was nicely breaded strips of white chicken, perfectly crisp and hot and juicy inside, not over-sauced....and the sauce was delicious. It was a good portion at a very good price, and a couple of chardonnays at $6 each made our meal about $32 total. We loved it."}
{"text":"I came because this restaurant has \"Vegetarian\" in it's name, and they didn't disappoint! I'm vegetarian and I love to eat at Thai restaurants because they can substitute tofu for any meat, but this restaurant goes even further by having an entirely separate vegetarian and vegan menu. It's a great feeling to look at a menu and know that I can order anything on it. 

The restaurant itself is small but very pleasant. It's nicely decorated and it has ambiance for informal dining. This is the type if place where you might bring your family. The waitress taking my order was very nice and did a great job of explaining some of the items on the menu. 

I had the appetizer spring rolls, then the cashew nut entree with tofu, following by sticky rice with coconut ice cream for dessert. The spring rolls were really good, and came with a really great sweet and sour sauce. The cashew nut was also quite tasty. If there was one thing I didn't like as much, it would be the coconut ice cream. I believe it was vegan ice cream, which means it's non-dairy and nonfat, which sort of sucks all the fun out of ice cream. But on top of that, the ice cream had chopped up green beans and corn in it. I can't say it was horrible, but it wasn't great. 

That being said, this was a great place and I can't wait to go there again at some point to try other things on the vegetarian menu."}
{"text":"This place is consistently awesome. Consistency is really the key to awesome. I don't usually review more than once but I am so impressed so regularly I have to say it again. 

Food is always hot and fresh. Tastes great. The duck rice was amazing last night. 

They cut two corners off the delivery containers so steam can escape. All food is delivered hot and yummy but never soggy from steam in the container. 

The delivery time is always excellent and faster than any other delivery restaurant in the area. Each and every delivery driver is polite and respectful. 

I seriously love this place. Now I've gotten my kids hooked on it too so my orders are getting bigger. My kids never liked Thai food but now it's a favorite for them too! 

Thank you guys. Yesterday was moving day. We were all tired, cranky, and hungry. You brought an awesome dinner super fast and saved the day! :)"}
{"text":"I love their food. It's always fresh, good size portions and the staff are always friendly and professional. My orders are  always come exactly the way I request. I suggest everyone who loves Thai food to give the restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Gloomy location with great food. The panang is great. Very nice sticky rice with coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"I just visited Kinnaree today for the fist time.  Holy Moly, this is amazing!  The vegetarian duck curry made my eyes water from the happiness I felt.  I'd venture to claim this dish is better than pizza!  I was also able to sample the yellow curry, the tom kha and the crispy spinach.  All amazing dishes.  The Tom Kha was perhaps the best I've had.  There were only two tables occupied during the dinner rush so service was quick and great.  No waiting in line for hyped thai, \"cough.. le thai... cough\"...
I have to give the place a couple more tries to gauge consistency but my gut tells me this is the best Thai food i've found so far in Las Vegas.  It's also next to Hedary's so you can pick up some falafel and hummus for desert."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and even better service. I can't say enough about the quality staff I've seen with each visit. I'm always greeted with a smile and it's always obvious that they genuinely care. I'm rating 5 stars because it's a great restaurant, great value, fantastic staff."}
{"text":"Love this place. Order delivery from here through Eat24 at least once a week. Nothing has ever been bad, and the spring rolls and thai iced tea are super delicious! No complaints."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious fresh rolls and green curry. The spicy scale is spicy. Great place for take out!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted something casual, off the Strip, and we ended up at Kinnaree Thai.  When we walked in at around 7:30pm on a weekday, there was only one couple there.  I wondered how a place with so many Yelp stars could be so empty.  But by the time we left, the place was packed.

To start, we ordered eggrolls.  They were free with Yelp check-in and they were great!  I ordered the sesame chicken and it was great!  I loved the sauce.  My friend got Pad Thai and enjoyed it, but said that she wishes she would have gotten it hotter.  (She ordered an 8 out of 10 on the hot scale and it was still not hot enough for her.)  We split a cucumber salad, which was very good.  Sweet and light, with cucumbers, red onion and shredded carrot.  I also ordered a Thai iced tea, which was good, as well.

Decor is simple, but cute.  There's a TV on the wall, where you can watch sports or whatever is on if you want.  It is not overly noisy, so you can actually have a conversation.  Service was very good.  The hostess/waitress made sure we were taken care of.

My friend and i agreed that we'd come here again."}
{"text":"Ummmm what do I say about my visit today...? Best Thai ever? They invented food? Oh my, I think I went too far...

I'm going to dream about the food. Not in a normal way, a naughty way. A thick rich...just see my pics...

Oh and before you read the veg porn below the customer service was AWESOME. Prompt, polite, and really caring to our needs. After we ordered everything she actually said \"everything vegan right?\" uh yes and I love you................

APP: We started off with veggie potstickers (v), they were perfect! If you don't like a warm pocket of ground up veggie goodness rolling around all in your mouth...don't order these. The sauce was also yummy.

I asked for \"spicy stuff\" and she brought me a three turner of: a red chili sauce, jalape√±os, and hot ground pepper flake.

MAIN: I had yellow (v) curry and brown rice. I'm going to dream about taking a bath in yellow curry. Not just any yellow curry. This yellow curry...thick, rich, flavorful with a little kick of spice...yellow curry. Calgon...I mean curry...take me away...
Give me your sexy soft potatoes in my mouth, give me your crisp flavorful veggies all day long. YES! Add a size to my pants you think rich curry...oh. 
Seriously this curry was full strength if you know what I mean...

MAIN: We ordered Lo Mein (v) or Chow Mein (who knows) with duck (v) and we were told we could have all those veggies but they were out of that type of noodles. No worries, we picked our fav big flat Chow Fun noodles and ate it right up...soooooo good. Not sure how they made that duck or where they bought it from...but it's the best faux faux I have ever eaten and I don't even like that bs.

MAIN: Crispy as crispy orange chickn'...I mean crispy orange tofu :) (v) that stuff was like they made fresh simmered orange sauce and reduced it into a sticky-icky sweet goodness. Oh wait they did. Dang. They even put fresh oranges all over the top of the dish. Real oranges.

Hubby and I could hardly finish our meal and so no room for dessert.

Ok, yea you get it, so this place is my new addiction. If you want to be addicted...hit me up. I'll meet you there and get your started. I'm really pleased it's on my side of town.
Mine all mine."}
{"text":"After reading many reviews we decided t op try it out for Valentine's Day. It was delicious!!! The vegitarian steamed spring rolls appetizers were soooo fresh. The sauce that accompanied them was so tasty that my girlfriend held on to the leftover after we polished off the rolls. The Herbal Salad lived up to all the hype AND MORE!!! The Crab Ragons were not to cream cheesey...they were awesome! Tom Yum soup was very good! They spice things to order 1-10. We chose 3 and it had just a little kick...I could have done 4 or 5. The coconut curry sauce in my vegitarian tofu dish was a little rich for my taste but the over all flavor was nice. If you like pineapple you have to try the Pineapple fried rice! We will definitely be back! If you're vegitarian like me make sure you ask for the vegitarian menu, lots of good choices!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! 

A few points I'd like to hit:

1. VEGETARIAN MENUS! Being a vegan in Vegas can be tricky at times. Here, there is a menu waiting for you!

2. The service is 100% amazing. They seat you quickly, make many rounds to see if you are ready to order and to make sure the quality of the food is nothing but the best. I never like to wait around for the waiter to take my order at other restaurants. That never happens here.

3. The food. I can't get over how delicious everything comes out. I always over-order things because I can't decide what to get; everything just sounds amazing and is amazing! Okay, getting hungry now...

I recently tried the orange tofu, a vegan substitute for orange chicken, and it was dreamy. 

Thank you for always giving me a heavenly experience! 

Everyone has to put this restaurant on their bucket list. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVED kinaree when it first opened ordered it 2x a week, awesome fresh food great veg menu, but  now every time i order the quality slowly deteriorates, sauces are getting oily and today I found a huge string of plastic in the egg rolls. Will be looking for another place"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place is rated over 2 stars much less 4+. The place is clean and it's nestled in a little shopping center next to a thai massage place so I was ready to be impressed. Thai is my favorite food so I'm always looking for new spots. One of my favorite spots in Vegas is Le Thai and there are some other noteworthy places as well. Since we planned a day at the aquatic center, we stopped here for a quick lunch. We was me, my mom, 2 year daughter and 5 year old niece. The egg rolls were awesome, for our entrees we ordered yellow curry and chicken house noodles. The yellow curry was gross and I've been to Thailand had tons of curry in the past. The noodles were over cooked and looked like throw up on a plate. We told the waitress she could take the plate and toss it- she never offered to let us order something else. The kicker was when we went to claim the two free egg roll yelp coupon, she didn't deduct it from our tab and told us we should have told her when we sat down that we planned to use it, wtf? So between the crap food and service we didn't even bother leaving a tip so I guess that saved us about $6-7 on a meal that was already $30, and it covered our egg rolls. Overpriced, overhyped, bland and bad service. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. There's way better Thai in Las Vegas. This was below average and unappetizing and that's being modest. Will never return.

P.S. The kids wouldn't even touch the noodles and they love noodles-- That tells you something. My 2 year old daughter filled up on plain white rice and my niece on the vegetarian egg rolls. Yelp doesn't usually fail me but today was an epic fail."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I tried out this restaurant for the first time and it was awesome.  We were both highly impressed.  Everything was authentic and fresh, which was a score.  The service, the atmosphere, the d√©cor high fives all around.  We definitely be back for more and also bring in other people to enjoy this goodness."}
{"text":"For a Vegan/Vegetarian Thai place it isn't too shabby. We grabbed the Larb and had a gab."}
{"text":"Excellent service, so friendly and nice. Excellent food, vegetarian, vegan, gluten free.  Wonderful wonderful restaurant. Owner came and asked us questions about our needs and wants."}
{"text":"Very good. Tastes fresh. Great lunch specials. Excellent vegetarian options. I will return."}
{"text":"The \"cjik'n\" satay was amazing  great flavors in the tom yum soup. I cant wait to try other dishes.   They will definitely be getting more to my business"}
{"text":"If you like thai authentic food this is the place to go. Very good and won't break your wallet, they have a great lunch Manu but watch yourself when you ask for spicy ITS very spicy!!! I love the papaya salad there and the green curry chicken, the soap was great too!"}
{"text":"Two words: Herbal salad! That stuff is delicious, D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!

Not even kidding, I've never ordered anything else here. The fact that my gym is right down the street may be a factor but this is honestly one of the tastiest salads out there, made with a mix of apple, coconut, lemongrass, basil, lime, and cashews, plus crispy tofu. All the ingredients have great texture, and harmonize nicely. Order a level 2 or 3 (1-10 scale) for a bit of punch in the house dressing that doesn't overpower the delicate balance of flavors.  

Service is polite and fast, restaurant is clean, lunch specials available til 3PM, and the menu has an entire page of vegetarian and vegan-friendly dining options."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. It's the only Thai place that I go to. Fortunately it's only a mile form work so we hit this spot once a week. My favorite dish is the chicken panang."}
{"text":"Our food was delicious as ever, but the portions are tiny and the forgot my rice that came with the soup. Im not sure if the down sized the dinner entree size but the panang curry came in a tiny container. We also purchased crab rangoons, which were okay but for 27 dollars Im rethinking if Id get delivery from them again. In the past it was much better."}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas we wanted to sample some off-the-strip excellent Asian food.  Was not disappointed. The Sea bass was incredible.  The spring rolls were delicious as well as the peanut sauce served with it.  The entire staff was extremely attentive to our every need and bent over backwards to make sure that the meal was as pleasant as possible.  This restaurant is a gem.  My only complaint not enough customers enjoying the food.  This restaurant has been open for six weeks.  This is a tough business.  Please give it a shot.  It deserves our support.

BTW, the cost for the four of us was less than half of a meal on the strip."}
{"text":"Food is good, after have it delivered to my house 4x in the last 4 months... all of a sudden my address is out of range for delivery.  Good food but not good enough for me to drive to pick it up."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food!  Tom kha soup, fresh rolls, panang curry and coconut ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place is so damn good that when I discovered it I ended up getting take out from them the next two days lol. I got the indian curry fried rice and added duck and fried tofu. My boyfriend got the panang curry. We both ordered it at a 9 because we love spice. It was a bit overwhelmingly hot but still so delicious. My fried rice was packed with flavor and had juicy pieces of duck and perfectly fried tofu. The next two days I ordered the vegetarian kinnaree salad and it is so addicting. It is refreshing and the dressing has such good flavor. I will definitely keep ordering from here. Everything is on point!"}
{"text":"We went there on the last day of our trip. I wish we had known about this place earlier. The place was clean, the service was great, the food even better. We are both vegetarians, and needless to say we weren't disappointed. The server paid a good attention to our needs.We can handle hot/spicy food, but be careful. Their 6-7 out of 10 scale is extremely hot. Not their fault. The next time I go, i'll be sure to go with 4-5.
Great experience. I don't remember the name of our server, but she was excellent.
It's a good 15-20 minutes drive from the strip, but well worth it in the end."}
{"text":"I could make it simple and say. Go here this place is great!! But then yelp wont let me post it as a review. Seriously though this place is great for vegans and carnivores alike. They have 2 menues just as populated as each other packed with awesome food! Note: This place is Spicy for a Thai place. So when they ask how spicy be prepared!"}
{"text":"I forgot to do an earlier post of when I order from here but I defenitely won't eat here again. I ordered the combination fried rice and the chicken curry. I usually get fried rice because I never met a Thai place with bad rice and I was proven wrong.. ....The fried rice was BEYOND GROSS I don't know what flavoring they used but I couldn't eat it. The meat in the fried rice had no flavor and was dry, it was so bad even my boyfriend who will eat anything didn't want to eat it. The chicken curry was okay the sauce and potatoes was good but the chicken was very dry and there was barely any potatoes in it!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!  The food was absolutely tasty with tons of flavor and the service was excellent.  I wanted to have pad see ewe, but since I was alone and on the road working, I knew the portion was going to be too much, so she offered to make it a lunch special for me!
Also...they have free wifi!
The interior was relatively modern and spacious for groups too!  Will stop in every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Delightful and surprising. Shrimp was cooked to perfection. Gluten and soy free options."}
{"text":"This place does NOT taste like Thai food you'd find in Thailand.  I've travelled all over Thailand and if you go expecting dishes to taste like they do here or vice versa then you will be disappointed. However if you like the award winning and vegan friendly Komol then you'll like this food. I think a previous reviewer mentioned this place is run by a former Komol waitress. She left with two of the kitchen staff ( though not the head chef so don't expect any new dishes) and the recipes seem the same down to the plating. The location is not any nicer than where the original Komol is located.
Not bad, but try the original if you're near the strip or East side. Avoid if you want authentic Thai food and have been to Thailand. You will not see Thai people eating here."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Thai restaurant! We have now dined here on two separate occasions and have had a great experience both times. The service was super friendly and quick, and the atmosphere is very nice.
 
Over our two trips we sampled the Spicy Basil Chicken, Panang Tofu Curry, Pad Kee Mao,Spicy Basil Fried Rice, and the Fresh rolls. All of these were excellent, we loved the Curry and Basil Chicken so much we ordered them both times!

Kinnaree offers many vegetarian options, they even have a separate veg menu, though this was not offered to use on our second visit

We are so happy to have found a great Thai restarant close to our new place! 

Kinnaree is second only to Komol as far as we are concerned!"}
{"text":"Mmm tasty! Thai Basil and Thai Curries are very solid - near the top of the heap. One of the big stars here is their Brown Rice which is a wild red variety. Soaks up the sauce/curry perfectly. Super nice service, and I can't wait to go back more often. Been twice in two months. They deserve to be very busy!

Nice to learn that they deliver as well."}
{"text":"We order from Kinnaree about once a week, couple of tips:

  -Don't try to call them, order on grubhub or eat24
 
 -Come one come all vegetarians, they have everything you could ever want
 
 -Try the curries, they're the best!"}
{"text":"Tom Kha was very good. Other food mediocre - papaya pad Thai was drowning in sauce, pineapple fried rice was low in flavor, sweet sticky rice was ok. 

Delivery was quick, and the delivery person very friendly. 

This place is ok, but I think it is overrated."}
{"text":"Vegitarian Thai Dishes!

Lots of places will do substitutions to make items Vegetarian or Vegan...At Kinnaree Thai and Vegetarian it's in the name, they have a full menu, and it's anything but an afterthought. 

Kinnaree is not my favorite spot for in town for Thai...but it certainly is for Vegetarian Thai!  I am not a vegetarian...I love meat. But I read a Popular Science article last year that described how \"Americans consume a disproportional amount of the world's stuff...we make up 5 percent of the global population, but use 20 percent of the world's energy. We eat 15 percent of the world's meat. We produce 40 percent of the world's garbage.\"  With that in mind I am trying to be a conscientious meat eater which can be incredibly difficult while eating out.  Enter Kinnaree!  I have heard good things about their normal menu, but I come for the veggies!  

I really like the Panang Curry!  Lots of deep, full, balanced flavors!  I have also enjoyed their yellow and green curries.  I typically avoid faux meat products, but the the faux duck and tofu options are better than normal here if you're into that.

The service was excellent,  the menu is huge, and they have a check-in offer as well.

They aren't as spicy as a typical Thai Restaurant...so ask for it a little spicier than you would otherwise if you typically like a good amount of heat."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Pad Kee Mao medium spice level and my boy friend ordered the sesame chicken hot spice level it was all DELICIOUS! Prices are very reasonable, delivery time was fast. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went this afternoon and the restaurant is now closed. The woman said they would reopen as a Japanese noodle house of some kind."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food. Very flavorful and tasty - try the papaya pad thai, tom yum tofu soup, and veggies and tofu. They can make just about anything gluten-free and many dishes can be made without oil. We had our rehearsal dinner there for our wedding - 30 people - and the owner Sha was very accommodating. In fact, when my Aunt and Uncle visited after the wedding, they specifically requested to go to Kinnaree. The best Thai food in town!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best Thai food I've had and I've been to Thailand. On the outskirts of Vegas, it was refreshing to find a vegetarian restaurant (they also have meat). If you are looking for authentic, delicious Thai food that is reasonably priced, eat here!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I am very impressed by their expeditious delivery, the quality AND deliciousness of their food!! I  ordered delivery via grubhub - the food was delivered within 40mins and was even greeted by my first name at the door. This place has beyond exceeded my expectations!! I will definitely be a regular here!! :-)"}
{"text":"I was originally looking for Lily's Thai and Vietnamese food since it was super close to my house, but i think it closed down? I decided to give this place a try. Let me just say  Wow!  I found my Thai restaurant here in Vegas :) I had the best service that I had in a long time. I ordered take out and I decided to wait at the restaurant and while I was waiting, the owner gave me a free Thai ice tea and asked if I wanted to play on his iPad haha. I ordered pad thai, crab ragoon, mixed vegetables with tofu, and panang curry with duck! All were equally amazing! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Update 
Went here and gotten the lunch special. Got the pad Thai, it came with a side of salad and an egg roll. The salad got too much dressing. The pad Thai is tasty but they are really skimpy on the meat (beef). Also they forgot to ask me how spicy it is, so when I asked them to make it spicy afterward, the server said that its too late cuz it's already done, ok.... HOWEVER, I didn't even get the food till 10 mins later, so obviously they are either still cooking it or it's just sitting on the counter, so why can't they just put some red pepper in the wok while I am just sitting there waiting. (The server was just standing around, so she wasn't serving nor was she too busy to give me my food and no, she didn't go in the kitchen after I asked). And why can't they make it over if it's not to a patron's satisfaction. 
Probably won't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Great food, little empty inside but the girl was polite, food was excellent, could be a little bigger portion but taste makes up for it."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and tried it out. It really is fantastic. Had amazing coconut soup followed by green curry and a fried banana ball to finish things off. Perfect. Try this place, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Kinnaree is a 3.5 for me based on a few reasons. It was very dark in the restaurant; the yellow curry was too sweet and watery; the pad kee mao was pretty bland.

I will still be back because I like the fact that they have brown rice and the quality of food is good."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Delicious!! I don't know what else to say. The staff is amazing, the food is amazing, the prices are right. I don't even know how many times I've been here. I've even gotten stuff and taken it to friends.  We always get tofu or chicken pad Thai, thai tea and Tom Yum. Mmmm if you're reading this debating on coming here, think no more. Just come in you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First time here. I wasn't very hungry and just needed a quick bite between errands.  I had the chicken Tom Kha (chicken coconut soup) and cucumber salad. Both were delicious. The service was fast and friendly. Excited to return and explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"If you consume a lot of vegetables versus meat, this is the perfect spot. 

The food tasted great and very fresh. Each item and a lot of vegetables each cooked perfectly. I ordered my meal through yelp and it was seamless. From the point of ordering to the delivery was about 15 minutes.  I ordered the pad woon sen, fresh spring rolls and the deep fried banana dessert. All of it was fresh and perfectly prepared.

$25 plus tip was enough to feed three adults with healthful food."}
{"text":"I dream about the herbal salad. Pro tip: don't plan on sharing.

Exepert level: this place is close the United Blood Services. Go donate and then come gorge... screw those mini juices and bags of pretzels."}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant and surprisingly, no kinks in their execution. 

Service is impeccable, prices are extremely fair and the food is stupendous. 

I've tried the following:
Pad Thai - Excellent
Indian Curry Fried Rice - Heaven
Spring Rolls - Yumm
Pad See Ew - Perfect
Pad Prik King - Hottt!
Fried Banana with Mango Ice Cream - Sinfully delicious
Tom Kha Soup - Comfort

All in all, everything here has been extremely tasty. Lunch specials range from $7 to $8 and include a spring roll and soup/salad. 

Dinner entrees are generally around $10. They have lots of vegetarian options and have I mentioned that their service is the best around. 

Highly recommended from a Thai Aficionado."}
{"text":"Love this place my new favorite Thai in LV!i order the vegetarian Thailand Tea herbal salad and veggie delight. Yum!!! 
Clean and friendly establishment."}
{"text":"We became aware of this restaurant recently as a result of driving on Sahara.
The reviews online are positive, so we decided to go there for a meal.

We persue a vegetarian/vegan diet, so we hope for meals that are attractive and conform to our dietary regimen. 

The restaurant has a vegetarian/vegan menu that is extensive, with many options.

We have been there multiple times, and have enjoyed each item that we have had there.  The appetizers, entrees, and soups are delicious, especially the Tom Kha and Vegetarian Seaweed.

The waitress is helpful, and the service is excellent, with reasonable prices.

We strongly recommend that you visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Solid three stars. Second time eating from here and first dining in house. Our server was extremely attentive. There were only two other tables eating @ 6.30pm so believe they have a big take out following. 

The Tom Yum wonton soup was great and spicy as ordered. The pad thai was wet and sweetly bland. Could have done w the usual condiments. Duck curry was average. Chinese broccoli w garlic sauce was fresh and crisp, not overcooked which is often the case.

They have a vegan menu which is a bonus (for those who actually are vegan!). However I am also suspect of Thai places that also offer Chinese food. Seems to be the go here."}
{"text":"VERRRRRRRRY good! I had read about this on yelp and kept meaning to come here. One day when I dropped my car off I looked around and walked past this place. How cool! I had the yellow curry veggie dish and it was very good. I've only had yellow curry at a couple of places so I'm not an expert. I really like the curry and rice. They had a check in offer for spring rolls. They were good too. I will definitely come back next time I have to get my car serviced."}
{"text":"Stopped in here in way to get a Thai massage next door. It is well lit and the staff is friendly.  The food seemed heavenly although there were big chunks of raw onion in the spring rolls.  The tom kha with mushroom is a delicious sour coconut soup with a touch of herbs. I really enjoyed it. 

If you are veggie this is a great spot to avoid strip prices and get tasty Thai food!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for authentic Thai food. The food was well prepared and delicious! I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Food is always good, place is quiet and clean.  Basil chicken, herbal salad, pad kee mao, panag, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, tom kha are a few favorite dishes."}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery from here for the first time and OMG it was the best Thai i have had since I moved to Las Vegas!! The garlic tofu was perfectly cooked and they actually have veggie potstickers! I want to eat here everyday now! Yum!"}
{"text":"This new Thai restaurant is awesome. Very authentic Thai food. I love their broccoli and crispy pork! 

Service is very attentive and helpful. I will definitely come back... Actually, I've had lunch there twice in consecutive weeks :)"}
{"text":"Place is ok nothing to brag about with all the other Thai restaurants around I don't think I would come back"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp. Love that they have a full separate vegan menu. 

Satay was amazing!
Red curry was good- we had a 3 level spice & that was enough!!!!
Kimaree noodles were good, a little oily
Thai iced tea was tasty, a little sweet

Wished they had a soft/fresh tofu option-- only had fried

Great place where vegans & omnis can co-exist"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times.  I had to tell everyone to try their food.  Everything has been great so far and the owner Sha (?) is so sweet.  I can't give you my favorite, cause everything has beeb great so far."}
{"text":"I came to Kinnaree last night for my birthday. As a vegetarian and a Thai food lover, I was really excited to see this place open up on my side of town.  

The restaurant wasn't very busy when we got there, but since it is fairly new I figured they were still building up clientele. We ordered a Thai tea and a glass of wine which came out promptly. They have a separate vegetarian menu with meatless forms of all the Thai standards, and it includes options for adding soy duck, chicken, or fish.

I started with a bowl of Tom Kha soup with tofu and vegetables. Tom Kha is my favorite Thai dish, and I order it at every Thai restaurant I try. This was hands down the best Tom Kha I have had in Las Vegas!  I highly recommend this soup when you come here. For our entrees we split an order of panang curry and the Kinnaree special noodles with added soy chicken. The curry was very savory and creamy, and the noodles were pan fried with their special sauce which I also found delicious.  All of the food was excellent and our server was very polite. We ordered all of the spicy meals at level 4 - I felt that it wasn't as spicy as a level 4 at Archi's or Lotus. Next time I will probably get a 6. 

At this point I had already decided that this was my new favorite local Thai restaurant, but what happened next really confirmed it. We went outside and discovered that we had a flat tire (and no spare). Our waitress came out to check on us when she saw us looking at the car. We were planning on calling a taxi, but our waitress insisted on offering us a ride home as it was near the end of her shift. She asked for 10 minutes to finish up, so we waited out in the lot. About five minutes later, her manager came out with a bottle of fix-a-flat and insisted on helping us plug the flat. Five minutes later, we were on our way home! He refused our offers to pay for the help, so we are going to go back for another dinner and to bring him a replacement bottle of fix-a-flat soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Pad Thai was good, could use a bit more flavor and spice. 

Satay chicken was delicious, and the \"free\" egg rolls were absolutely fantastic! 

Delivery was 25 min ahead of schedule... Very impressive!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Our entire family ate from the vegan menu and loved each bite. The vegetable panang was wonderful. The soup does not disappoint. Appetizers of spring rolls, noodle salad, and  herbal salad were so light and tasty. A definite trip back is coming in our future."}
{"text":"Very accommodating for vegan customers. Its vast range of dishes made vegan and without msg. My favorite place for Thai. Try the banana spring rolls."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the slowly-improving Thai scene in Las Vegas! Tucked into a small strip mall, Kinnaree features excellent quality of product, fresh veggies, a large selection of vegetarian options and super friendly service. 

The brother-and-sister team that own and operate this restaurant cannot be nicer. Attentive and speedy, they make sure you have an enjoyable experience. The space itself is a decent size with about 20 tables and counter seating. I was very impressed with how clean it was, from the tables to the floors to the bathrooms.

They have great lunch specials that are plentiful and affordable (entrees come with egg rolls and soup).

Veggie lovers rejoice!! ...as Kinnaree offers many tofu options (fried or fresh bean curd) and even soy meat substitutes (fake chicken, duck or fish). As a former vegetarian, I truly appreciate these meatless options, plus the dishes maintain their integrity of flavor and aroma."}
{"text":"This place was yummy ! :) price was a little high but it's worth it ! Veg head friendly !!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service!  I had chef special which was grilled salmon in panang sauce , very spicy just how I like and the man had pad kee Mao. Just excellent all of it. Dessert was green tea mochi and mango with sticky rice... kinda wish someone would wheel barrow me outta here!  So full, so happy, definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery from them for quite some time now and I can't think of a time where I've been disappointed (which is more than I can say for the other places I get delivery from). Many places (especially Thai) will give you worse service as time goes on if they see that you're a loyal customer. BUT this place doesn't ever disappoint me, its the only reason why I'll pay the 5 dollar delivery fee (I mean, who would pay 5 dollars for delivery? lol). Anyway, I've gotten the pad thai (good), tom yum soup (very good), beef noodle soup (also good), beef salad (good), yellow curry (very good), and thai beef jerky (good). Its an overall good place to eat at, especially with the dwindling quality and service of other restaurants these days."}
{"text":"I came here based on the other reviews. I was not disappointed. I ordered from the vegetarian menu and had tom yum with vegetables, papaya salad, and spicy tofu basil. Everything was excellent. Only tip is that the vegetarian papaya salad and tom yum soup suffer from a lack of fish sauce. I recommend ordering it with the fish sauce if you are a pescatarian or a less devout vegetarian."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've only been twice now but the service is amazing and better yet, the food is totally on par with my favorite Thai haunt, Komol, or wait for it....even better!  I can't wait to keep trying more things on the menu!  They have an entire separate vegetarian/vegan menu to explore.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials for only $8.  Crispy rice was solid.  If Westsiders don't feel like driving to Lotus, this is a great (less expensive) substitute."}
{"text":"It's not the best Thai I have ever had but it was very good.  The pad Thai was a bit bland for my taste but the pineapple fried rice was excellent and so was the curry.  A friend got the house special duck dish and loved it.   Duck is not my thing, but I tried it and it was quite delicious.   The service was also very attentive."}
{"text":"Everything we have had from here was amazing! Loved the egg rolls,pad Thai & crab Rangoon's! Not to mention the eGg rolls were FREE!!! Can't wait to eat here again - ohh & try the herbal salad!
The dressing is like nothing you've ever tasted! It's so very refreshing YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Food here tasted very good. But the service was slow and the food was pretty expensive at over $50 without tip and without any alcohol for only 2 people. Plus, the serving size of our main entre, the spicy basil sea bass, was miniscule. Left this place still feeling hungry. You can certainly get comparable Thai food at other places in town for a lot less and get much more value for your money."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from them twice. I like my Thai food pretty spicy so the first time I ordered all 3 dishes as a 7/10. One of them had good heat, one was average, and one was pretty bland. The second time I ordered all 8/10. One was great, one was average and one was borderline too hot. All of them were great but be forewarned that the spice level will vary. The delivery was fast and the person that delivered was very friendly and polite. Prices are totally appropriate. We will order from them again and we plan on eating on site soon too."}
{"text":"I like going to Kinnaree Thai because they have a lot of choices. They also have a separate menu for vegetarians. I'm not a vegetarian but I do prefer some of my dishes without any meat like my Tom Kha soup and spring rolls. 

The egg rolls come with 4 pieces which is enough for me because my husband doesn't usually want any. He waits for the spring rolls which he prefers. I love the veggie Tom Kah soup especially when my throat is scratchy . It does the trick every time! When I go for Chinese or Thai I get the craving for both noodles and  a rice dish. It can get pricey that is why I just ordered the drunken noodles with a side of white rice instead of fried.  The prices at Kinnaree I find a bit lower than other Thai restaurants in the area. What keeps me coming back is the price, selection and good food. It's a little out of my way but I think it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and was very pleasantly surprised. They have an entire vegan menu! Place was clean and everything tasted extremely fresh. Lost one star because they seemed a little understaffed and service was a a tad slow. We ordered the herbal salad (OUT OF THIS WORLD! I would say their version was fresher and tastier than Komol), the garlic fried rice which was just ok, the orange tofu, perfectly crispy, not to much sauce, the vegan chicken satay, delicious, and the papaya pad thai which was SO great! They use papaya shreds instead of noodles which makes this also gluten free! FABULOUS! My son ordered one of the meat dishes and he said it was very good. Portions are good sized and enough to share. All in all a very good experience and I will definitely be back to try more of their items. Oh and the fried banana dessert is officially one of my favorite desserts now! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and the food is amazing. It's such a great value and I always leave happy.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pad thai.  I ordered it medium in spiciness and it was quite hot, but still very tasty.  My daughter ordered chicken green curry, mild, but it was still very spicy, but flavorful.  Rice came with the curry.  I ordered some calamari, which was very tasty and came with a red dipping sauce.  My daughter had two vegetable egg rolls that were delicious.  I would order again from Kinnaree."}
{"text":"Ordered on yelp! Wonderful feature with updates on the orders. The delivery was quick, the food tasted a lot better than it looked.. Not that it looked bad, just saying it in case my pictures looked bad. The beef jerky didn't look like the pictures another person posted on here but none the less it was great! All of it tasted wonderful!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food. We had pot stickers, chicken fried rice, Tom Yum, egg drop soup, Mongolian beef and the free eggs rolls.  Very fresh food,the vegetables were crisp. Tom Yum is ok, a little bland for me.  I am used to spicy Hot & Sour soup.  Everything else was very flavorful. Fast and friendly delivery."}
{"text":"I like this place, but man, it can take a little bit of time to get your order.  Much faster when I walk in to get a to go order than when I sit down.  Love the panang and the shrimp pad thai."}
{"text":"We shared orders of herbal salad, pad Thai and basil chicken. We took the suggestion of our server and ordered our entrees at medium spice level which turned out to be a mistake as both were much too mild.   Each dish was both fresh tasting, well balanced and visually appealing.  The quantity of food was generous so we ended up taking most of the herbal salad with us and finished it a few days later. 

A rating of 3.5 would be most appropriate."}
{"text":"Food was great, the vegetarian salad that everyone raves about is worth every penny! Service was good also; quiet little place but definitely worth a try if u like vegetarian food or the others..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for a Saturday afternoon lunch. The food was great and delivery was fast and friendly. Sesame Chicken, Pork Fried Rice, Egg Rolls were very tasty and portions were nice size. Looking forward to trying more from this menu."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome vegetarian/vegan menu option!! My friends and I ordered veggie springs rolls for appetizers, then we ordered the red curry, pad thai, pad see eew, and Mongolian tofu for our entrees.  Everything was very tasty.  We ordered half of the dishes spicy ( red curry & pad thai)  and boy it was spicy!!  I can't really handle spicy so I ordered the Mongolian tofu and pad see eew with a spice level of 1.. ha.  All of this was $43!!!!!!  so the price is right!! LOL. 

The service was good.  The waitress was very friendly and came back to check up on us.  She even refilled our water glasses without us having to ask.

The ambiance is not really there... but it doesn't matter too much to me.. just as long as the food is good.  I love that this restaurant caters to the vegan lifestyle.  The whole back of the menu is for vegetarians/vegans.  The front of the menu has all the meat options. 

I am definitely coming back to this place to try more dishes... i even wanna hit up the lunch menu!! I recommend this place and give the vegetarian.vegan menu a try.. it was not disappoint."}
{"text":"We love this place the food is awesome and always good we eat here at least dr once a week and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I just moved on this side of town and got delivery from this place! It Was the best Thai food I have had in Las Vegas! Incredibly fresh! Taste was phenomenal! Fast, clean and most importantly the quality of the food! If there's was a 10 star option I would be the first! Highly recommend this place if your looking for perfect heathy food made fresh!"}
{"text":"The fiance and I came here for a quick lunch in between my dental appointments close by. 

They were doing lunch specials so we decided to go with those. It came with a eggroll which was standard and fine and a good cup of tom yum broth with some mushrooms. 

I chose chicken basil which came with white meat and had a pleasant sauce. The BF got a panang curry which I thought was decent from the bites I got of it, but it's just not my preferred style of how it's seasoned.

The girl serving us was friendly and attentive to boot. 

The plus is this place can cater to all types of diets. We were asked if we eat meat or not and their vegetarian and vegan offerings were pretty solid. I'll probably be back to try more dishes during dinner as some offerings like the herbal salad look worth a return.

 A-OK rating for now as it was fine food, but JUUSST fine."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this is my favorite Thai restaurant that I have discovered (more so that Prommares and Weera). You can order as spicy as you want (like all Thai restaurants), but I love how they have a full vegan menu! My favorite dishes include the \"chicken\" satay, the yellow curry with tofu (and no broccoli (I hate broccoli), the orange tofu and of course... the herbal salad! I actually got to the point with my friend that we kept ordering the herbal salad (because it was so dang good) until we got burned out :) 

The restaurant is very clean and the server (Bee) is great and attentive. The prices are also reasonable and when I have ordered for pickup I've never had any issues. The one thing I do like is that they are never too busy for a table wait (most of their orders are delivery/pickup it seems) so it's never a long wait. I hate waiting to eat, and here it's always efficient.

Also - if you can - order the sweet sticky rice and mango!! It's the best I've had, and the sticky rice is super tasty! 

To the reviewer that said it was not \"authentic Thai\" based on your trips to Thailand, I gather you ate at the \"safe\" restaurants and not from the local vendors. I speak Thai, and grew up with a Thai mother - so I have a very good taste for Thai food - and I would say you probably ate at the \"foreigner-friendly\" places which are not the true taste of Thailand. In addition to this, different parts of Thailand have different tastes to the food - much like that in the US. Also something to keep in mind. Le Thai is great (although I prefer Kinnaree) but it's more of an American spin on Thai food."}
{"text":"fantastic thai food, reasonably priced. get the panang curry and pad kee mao - deadly combo!"}
{"text":"In search for the best Thai in town!

I usually start off with the Pad Kee Mao & Pad Ka Pao...if these are great, I come back and try the Panang Curry and others the next visit.

\"Spicy Basil\" aka Pad Ka Pao ($7.95): Chicken, Garlic, Chilies and Basil. This was a great rendition, although their \"spicy\" is not very spicy here.  I always ask for Thai Spicy : 10/10...I love to sweat, and feel like the flavor in Thai food is in the spices and heat.  Although it wasn't very hot, the flavor was still there and it was enjoyable.

Pad Kee Mao ($7.95): Pork, Garlic, Hot Peppers, and Basil. This was BLAND, not spicy at all, and it was missing something...maybe not enough fish sauce?? Disappointing.  It was probably the least flavorful Pad Kee Mao I've had actually...in the noodles and the pork itself.

Their Lunch Specials are fair prices and portions, and come with choice of soup or salad.  The salad had a pretty tasty peanut sauce, but the soup (not a fan of this soup) was on the bland side.  Stick with the salads here.

Wasn't too impressed, so I doubt I will be back, but if you don't eat the Pad Kee Mao, chances are you will enjoy the food here.

Pics! :"}
{"text":"For two people for lunch this was a $40 ticket. The most I've ever paid for Thai was closer to half that. The Chicken Pad Thai was not great. Sort of flavorless. It's right across from my office but I don't think I'll go here anymore. 

Sorry."}
{"text":"I do not review often due to time constraints, but this restaurant definitely deserves all 5 stars.

Fantastic service. Excellent food.  Very affordable.  Terrific menu selection.

It is noteworthy to mention that I have been to all of the other highly rated Thai restaurants in town (e.g. Lotus of Siam, Archie's, Thai BBQ etc.) several times over. They are also very good, but this restaurant stood out in terms of the quality of ingredients.

Dish: Pad Kee Mao.  The first thing I noticed was how fresh the ingredients were.  I literally did not talk the entire time I was eating.  The only time that has happened was during a Kabuki intermission show dinner I had in Tokyo, Japan.  (To this date, that was my best meal ever. )

The owner is very adamant on making this a successful venture. She knows everyone that comes in regularly and wants everyone to have a great experience.  You almost feel as if you're at home.

Highly recommend to anyone. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in and we both really enjoyed it. We've been to a number of Thai restaurants in Las Vegas and this is easily better than most.

Food was fresh and tasty and the service was good.

I especially liked the duck fried rice."}
{"text":"Excellent! The entire menu has a Vegetarian equivalent-huge selection! I ordered the Tom Kha with Mushroom soup YUM! and the papaya salad, very very good! Then the roasted pumpkin slices in coconut milk-very subtle taste, not too sweet, I'd probably not order it again, but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful,  the service is great, and the food is even better, I order from the all vegan menu and was very surprised by all the variety, the herbal salad is a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in Vegas!! Just had the lemon grass soup with chicken!! Great if you have a cold! The brown rice is good as well with any of the curry!! Try it and let them know how you like it!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Tom Combo soup & house fries rice is great. Spicy Basil chicken is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This has become a regular visit for lunch for me over the last few months and only two words are to blame for this:   Herbal Salad.

Oh you don't know about Herbal Salad?   If you've ever been to Komol and had the pleasure of trying the version there, then you probably don't need any convincing, but it's a a wonderful combination of veggies, tofu, nuts, fruit, hot pepper and lime juice.  Sounds like the worst health shake combination ever but trust me in salad form it's a delight.   As much as I love Komol it's quite a drive for me from home or work so I dont make it there nearly as often as I'd like, though the herbal salad has made it difficult to stay away.    Well salvation has come in the form of Kinnaree having the exact same dish!   

Some quick background on Kinnaree:  in doing my daily yelp search I saw some positive reviews being thrown their way and figured I needed to try it as I do all Thai restaurants in the area.   Well imagine my surprise when Google Maps led me right to (formerly known as) Lilly's Thai restaurant.   I felt swindled to be honest.   Lilly's was always decent, but not something I ever craved, so I was worried this was simply a name change and that I'd have the same underwhelming experience I felt I'd had in the past.  Then I saw it, written in marker on a chef's special board \"herbal salad\".    Could it be the same as Komols?!  Or was this some mirage and Kinnaree's version would consist of a bowl of ground up Basil, Oregano, and catnip?   I'm happy to report it was the former, and I've since gone back several times to get it take out.

In my 4 times having it so far at Kinnaree, 3 of the 4 times it has rivaled Komol's version, with the perfect amount of spice (5 out of 10 on their scale) balanced out by the sweetness of the coconut and apples.   One time it was drenched with way too much lime juice but thankfully that hasnt been the norm.

I was hesitant to write this review as I was worried a lot of you savages would go and start ordering this dish and make it harder for me to get.   Mark my words the first time I try ordering it and they say they are out, this review is coming down in a flash.   Ya'll owe me on this one!"}
{"text":"I've ordered deliver from here a few times and have noticed a few consistent negatives:
1) The lunch special portions are minuscule. I could understand if it were cheaper than the surrounding Thai restaurants' lunch prices but it's not. 
2) the spice levels are well above most places. I usually eat a moderately spicy red curry yet when i ordered a lever 5 here, i could barely eat it. 

Aside from the above complaints, the food taste and quality is quite good. The pad see ewe was delicious and without it being a lunch special, actually had a decent portion. The red curry chicken is tasty too, just wish there was more of it. I probably won't order from here any more, it's worth more to drive and get take out from pan Asian or Archie's."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at this new Thai restaurant. LOVE IT! It is a small cozy place, extremely clean and the waitress (who is also an owner) was super to us. The food was excellent and priced great! I will be making this place one of my neighborhood haunts :)"}
{"text":"Family style restaurant.  We went in and ordered way too much for my husband and I.  A couple could get away with ordering 1 app, 1 soup and 1 entree to share.  We Ordered the Larb, crispy rice salad, seaweed soup, Tom yum soup & basil chicken.  Everything was fantastic.  Had plenty of leftovers.  I usually order things spicy & the #5 was plenty spicy.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my, I had the spicy seafood salad, panang curry w\ beef, and pineapple fried rice. I fell in love."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always great service and the food is awesome. Their vegan Tom Kha soup is the best! 

Delivery was reasonably timed and the order was correct the one time I ordered it. Would order delivery more often but the minimum is pretty high and so is the delivery fee so it's usually not worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was surprisingly soo good! As a lover of Thai food I was happy to find this little hidden gem. We checked in and received the two free egg rolls which were delicious. The waitress was nice and our food didn't take long. The portions are big! I had to take me salad home. Overall this place was great and I would go again."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant by accident. I was trying to find a thai/Vietnamese restaurant that used to be in it's place. Not a big deal, because when I yelped this new restaurant, there was a free eggroll check-in offer! Got to love free stuff..

Anyway, walking in, i noticed that there's a sign for \"2013 best restaurant\". I'm not sure when this place opened, so I'm also not sure if that sticker belonged to the restaurant before it or not. (Both have had great reviews on yelp). The restaurant is quaint. Small but clean. Looks empty, even though there's paintings on the walls.  I'm assuming they're just THAT new. But as I was sitting there, a ton of people came in. Lunch time rush? It looked quite popular. 

To start, I ordered a thai tea. Sweet, yummy, refreshing.. can't really go wrong with thai tea. 

The free egg rolls were pretty standard.. vegetarian egg rolls. They may have been frozen actually.. but I'm not picky.

For my entree I ordered the beef and meatball noodle soup. It was on the lighter side, the broth was clearer than I'm used to for a Thai beef soup. The flavor was not as intense as I was used to either. But it wasn't bad. Just different. It ended up being exactly what I needed as I wasn't feeling so well and wanted something really soupy vs flavorful.  

My boyfriend ordered the fried pork and chinese broccoli. That was REALLY good. The fried pork belly was crunchy and fatty (if you're going to order pork belly, you have to know it's fatty to begin with. So no complaining here!). And the Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. Firm and crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside - al dente. And the flavor was excellent. I think they use some kind of oyster sauce base, but they mixed it well with other flavors to dilute the strong oyster flavor. It's a must try!

Overall, food was good, ambience was okay, and service was great.. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"You'd better come here and try delicious Thai foods and also they have vegetarian food with awesome taste!!!
Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Well went to go eat lunch here with my boyfriend because his family orders from here a lot. It's 1:25pm on a Saturday and they were closed when they said they are open on Saturdays at 11am."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  They accommodated my vegan gluten free needs and even had an entire vegan menu.  Papaya pad Thai is the best.  Group of 8 so we tried lots of things and they were all fantastic.  Excellent service.  A must!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! 2nd time ordering it and I am really impressed by the quality. I have had the duck fried rice, tom Kha soup, and tofu delight. I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"*I am not a vegetarian. 
My usual Thai restaurant was closed so we've decided to try another place out.

Ordered chicken pad thai and a pineapple fried rice.

Noodle for pad thai was undercooked, it was too chewy and some part was hard. 
They did not ask us for the level of spiciness, just gave us a very sweet pad thai. It was too sweet for me, because I usually have spicy pad thai.
Other than that it was okay.

For the pineapple fried rice, it just tasted like catchup. 
Some might like it, but not for me. I am used to other restaurants' pineapple fried rice which does not taste like catchup at all.
For me it was horrible. 

The decor of the restaurant is outdated. Looks like a local family owned restaurant.  Nothing below or above that. Which I do not mind anyway.

Overall, I would describe the food as...food I get to eat when I go over friend's house. Not extremely good and not awfully bad, but just little different taste than what I usually have. Different style.

Definitely a homemade food taste. If you get what I mean."}
{"text":"Set back in an insignificant strip mall, comes a most delightful wonder of flavors.

Perhaps a misnomer, but Thai and Vegetarian is more than vegetarian, it's Thai with vegetarian in mind.  They graciously make available strictly meat and strictly vegetarian menus with all the usual fare.

What makes this establishment so splendid is that its very freshly prepared.  I got an order of egg rolls (courtesy of a Yelp check-in), and the Red Panang curry with tofu.  Both were excellent.  The curry, in particular, left an amazing taste minutes later.

Simplistic in presentation, it's all about the food.

The service is ultra sweet, too.  While in no way is it a 5.0 star, it's a strong 4.  It certainly beats a kick in the pants."}
{"text":"one of the better thai style restaurant's I have had in a while 

Fresh roll - had mint in it and almost sushi like presentation very good 

also went with lemon chicken - very good as well the lemon was there and also liked the fact the added the lemon slices witch was soft and edible. 

I deff wanna try there soups I guess that will be for next time :)"}
