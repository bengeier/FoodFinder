{"text":"Consistently good Chinese. Well-priced, good quality \"comfort\" food. They have an extensive menu where you can find something for everyone.

I particularly recommend the crispy beef (yum!)"}
{"text":"Ordered through just-eat.

Fast delivery. Hot, fresh food. Tastes more like 'real' food than the salt bomb you normally get for 'Chinese' food. Very satisfied - will definitely order again."}
{"text":"This used to be my wife and Is favorite Chinese take out for the last 10 years. Unfortunately the quality of the food has dropped considerably over the last year or so. Last night's order was absolutely terrible. Overcooked and mushy Shanghai noodles. Dried out and chewy General Tsos chicken and sweet and sour spare ribs. We now have a fridge full of inedible leftovers!  We won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for North American Chinese food, this is the place!
They've never disappointed me, always prepared fresh. The place is right across from the food terminal so you can expect a bunch of burly truckers during the day.
It's not a fancy place, more of a dive but aren't those the ones that serve the best food? I always get the special, Menu #3 with a won ton soup.
Very satisfied and will be back."}
{"text":"I've driven by this location so many times and it doesn't look like much.  I finally tried and I'm planning to make this my Chinese take out / delivery place.  The food is very well done. I tried beef ho fun and mo shu beef.  Both are flavourful, no MSG and cooked well.  Good portions and quality ingredients.

And, so close to home, this will be one of my regular goto places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My wife and I felt like some comfort food and Chinese food was top on the list. We were new to the area and not sure where to order, we checked Yelp and found Wok Terminal to be rated well. We placed our order for delivery and It was here very fast and nice and hot! The food was very well prepared and tasted great. We have made Wok Terminal our take out choice for Chinese food. We have ordered from there 4 times now and each time the food was great along with the delivery time."}
{"text":"Great service.  Delivery was very fast.  Did not mess up the order but food was bland.  Compared to other Chinese take out, this was sub par."}
{"text":"Excellent food take out or delivery. My only complaint is they have the wrong apartment Entry Code in their system even though I keep telling them, they keep bothering my neighbours. So I don't order too often late at night."}
{"text":"Desperate for a Chinese Food place and due to high reviews on Yelp, I ordered from Wok Terminal through \"Skipthedishes\". The food is mediocre and does not reflect some of the better quality Chinese take out some may be used to getting from Markham restaurants. The way the dishes are cooked are suited for vert Americanized Chinese taste buds. The \"ho fun\" otherwise known as fried rice noodles falls apart upon picking it up with chopsticks and they seem to put the same vegetable medley in all their dishes."}
{"text":"Great Chinese Food.

You can eat in the restaurant, but in my opinion a better option is to have it delivered or just pick up your order and take it home.

The food here is really good.  I've been back a number of times and everything was amazing.  The ingredients are fresh, well cooked, and they don't scrimp on the portions.

I believe that they deliver through www.just-eat.ca, or directly by calling the restaurant."}
{"text":"I got takeout from Wok Terminal last night: the Vegetable Fried Rice was GREAT! I was expecting those tiny cubes of probably-pre-frozen vegetables mixed into some plain rice, but this had lots of crisp broccoli, bok choy, sprouts, onion and more... plus the rice itself was quite tasty.

I also got the Orange Chicken, which was disappointing. It looked saucy and nice on the outside, but it was very dry and tough on the inside, like it had been overcooked/overheated. After chewing like crazy on a few pieces, I decided it was inedible and we threw the rest out. Wished I had spent that money on something else on the menu.

Lastly, I got the BBQ Pork slices, which were pretty good. There was LOTS of uninterrupted meat in the container -  no veggies in this dish as a \"filler\". The sauce wasn't super tasty, but it was sweet (as expected) and the pork was very tender and nice."}
{"text":"Excellent Canadian and some authentic Chinese Food.  Their best dish is the General Tao Chicken, and it can be had in a quick lunch special served on either noodles or rice.  Best bargain in town!

Had their food many times and since moved away, but make the effort to drive past every couple of months, just because it is so good.

Prices are normal for this kind of take-out, but the quality is far above any chain, and most small shops I've been to.  Definitely a place to try out."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat when you can't think of anything to make. Not many good options for Chinese take out in the area and this one is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"My food was hot! very important! it tasted very fresh and flavourful. 
I really enjoy the vegetable chow-mein ! 

Being a vegetarian I liked that they had Vegetable Tofu 
Try it out!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but feel obliged to if it stops even one person from making the same mistake I did. My wife and I decided to give this place a try yesterday. Not only was the food terrible the fried rice tasted like something you would get from those store bought microwaveable ones but the smell on all of our clothes the next day is virtually unbearable including jacket, scarf, etc. 

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Always had excellent service and food here.  Food is non-greasy, flavourful and affordable.  The combos are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a casual weeknight take-out.  The prices are quite reasonable, the food is always ready on time and the staff are very polite.  We usually have the Kung Po Chicken with white rice and sometimes the Squid with Salt & Spice - both are very tasty.  Others from my neighbourhood seem to really like it too so it's worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery - was pretty fast for a frigid night!  Regular Chinese but everyone hung was done well, not overly salty and not dripping in sauce (just right amount).  Overall I will order again from them!"}
{"text":"To start off, I normally would not review a place that I use for food delivery.  That being said, I get food delivery from these guys at least twice a week.  I wasn't a huge fan until I tried their Crispy Ginger chicken.....can you say YUM!  I am a creature of habit when it comes to food delivery and I have had these guys deliver at least 20+ times now....so I know there is no issue with consistency.  I usually order the crispy ginger chicken, a large white rice, 2 spring rolls, and a veggie or beef fried rice (veggie is better), and I sometimes throw in an order of dumplings which are to die for.  And if you are thinking that this is a lot of food for 1 person, it is.....but I am ordering for two:)  The price is reasonable and the food is always piping hot and fresh.  The delivery drivers are always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"OK this review is  a little late but terminal wok may leave you terminally ill!! What I ordered from their menu was a vegetable medley that was covered in some Gross Oily sauce, my friend ordered sweet-and-sour chicken balls but they did not deliver on the sour part or sweet so it was just chicken balls that were very dry!! I think the food on their menu is not even safe to serve to prison inmates. 
 
We ended up throwing out our food and ordering from somewhere else, they advertise in our building on Max TV the food in the pictures it looks fantastic but the food arrives is disgusting and looks nothing like it!! I hate giving bad reviews but this one you deserve it!"}
{"text":"This place is not good whatsoever. Everything tasted like fish, and I didn't order fish, when i called to complain he told me off saying that I should have told him I had a fish allergy- I DIDN\"T ORDER FISH! It was so fishy my entire home smelt like I had just cooked fish all day in the kitchen. Over priced, RUDE RUDE RUDE staff. I highly recommend somewhere else."}
