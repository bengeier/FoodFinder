{"text":"Authentic Thai food. Menu offers great varieties. Some of the dishes are really authentic and you can't find it in any other Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I 'found' Na Siam by fluke. I was heading to a restaurant across the street from them, but a nasty fight just broke out, cops arrived and all, and I didn't feel like getting blood stains on my shoes. So, I turned right instead to Na Siam, and it has been my go-to Thai restaurant in the area ever since.

Na Siam serves authentic Thai food and as a result -- as a previous reviewer noted -- their food has a great (spicy) kick to it. Good thing I'm Asian and I love my spices. 

They make delicious Authentic Pad Thai ($11.95), rice noodle with tamarind sauce, chicken, shrimps, red onion, carrot, chive, beansprout, peanut, tofu, wrapped in egg crepe, which I always use to measure how good Thai restaurants are. My favourite (red) curry here is the Duck Curry, which is roasted duck mixed with creamy red curry, sweet bell pepper, tomato, lychee, and fresh basil leaf ($13.95). As for their signature dishes, definitely try their Khaosoi Gai ($10.95), which is Thai Northern style curry egg noodles with sliced chicken breast and drumstick served with pickled cabbage, red onion, dried shallot, coriander and lime.

I've also ordered from Na Siam for our office lunches. Evidently everybody loves their food as there is never any leftover."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad see iew and i gotta say that it was delicious and authentic.  the portion size was decent and was enough to fill me up.  it wasn't too salty like other places, and i'm definitely ordering it again.  as to other dishes, the rad-na that my friend order was good too, but there was definitely more vegetables than noodles that he craved for.  that's something they can improve on!  otherwise, this is a great place to eat, especially the convenient location."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice.  First time with a deal coupon and I came back because it was so good.  So it was last week and I ordered a choice from the dinner special, the spicy beef.  And boy!! it did not disappoint.  It was so spicy that I was glad I was eating alone and not on a date, I think I blew my nose at least 4 times during the meal.  but fric, was it ever good.  
I accidentally forgot to tell the waiter my special request when I ordered, but I remembered after a few minutes and ran to tell him, which he quickly ran to the kitchen to relay the message.  Even though it was my error, no  one scowled at me and I wouldn't have blamed them if they did.  It was a lot of food too, I was stuffed by the end of the meal.  Reminds me of the last time I was there, at least a year ago, maybe more, great food.  
The service was great, quick, efficient and everyone was friendly, I remember that from the last time too.  The waiter came by a couple of times to make sure my food was good and another lady that I recognize from last time too.   Smiling, friendly people, just like last time too.   The waiter didn't neglect my water either, even though a beverage came with the meal, I opted out and went with tap.  
It has that semi cafeteria feel, but not so much that you actually feel like you are in one."}
{"text":"This is a typical Thai restaurant that one would find in this neighborhood (Yonge and Bloor). Like many, it's menu is a \"build-your-own\" type with several items to choose from. It's great for take out and sit in situations. The prices are generally below 10 dollars for lunch. 

I recommend the classic pad Thai."}
{"text":"I have been to this place three to four times already, but nothing on their menu is worth going back for. With Spring Roll restaurant & take out, located just opposite to it, its hard to convince yourself you are getting your money's worth. I don't think i will go here anymore."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here, slightly small portion sizes. Finally a place with some seasoning in their food!! Could be a bit more spicy (with the exception of the green curry which had great heat). We are and will continue to be frequent customers."}
{"text":"Not really all that authentic (I lived in Thailand) but pretty good. Pad Thai was great, and available in Canadianized, \"authentic\" and street style. We got takeout for a large group and it was ready on time without any hiccups either."}
{"text":"As a Thai food lover, anyplace claiming \"authentic Thai\" always suckers me in.  Na Siam even puts it in the name of the restaurant, so you figure they can't be lying.  Then you read the menu and notice the red peppers and carrots in many of the dishes, and you start to get suspicious.  Well, your suspicions are justified, friend. This is yet another authentic Thai poser.  Now I'm sure they're trying to appease the masses, but I must say - don't call it authentic then!  

The run down:

Golden Purses - Delicious
Street Pad Thai - I know they don't say that it has tamarind, but hey!  does street pad Thai ever not have tamarind?  come on.  We had to add fish sauce and lime to bring it to life.
Basil Seafood - Bland and carrot-ridden.  
Duck Red Curry - While there were shredded carrot in here, it was tasty enough to overlook.  A recommended dish.  

All-in-all, it was a decent delivery experience.  While some dishes were disappointing, it's probably worth a stop for lunch.  But you're better off going to Bua Thai."}
{"text":"Watch out Sukhothai, a new player is in town for authentic thai food!  (We came to try this place for dinner when they had their $10 off Facebook promotion.)

We ordered authentic pad thai (wrapped in an egg crepe), beef curry and a signature dish - glass noodles with mushrooms that came with pineapple rice.

We were happy with our selections, service was attentive and the portion size was just right.

Since this location is right near Yonge & Bloor I will probably come back to try their $6.99 lunch special."}
{"text":"A less cheap and cheerful alternative to Ginger!

You can entertain yourself by watching characters hanging out at the Brass Rail and have yourself some \"authentic pad thai\".  

The menu has a lot of items and everything sounded delicious.   
I ordered the dinner special to-go for $11.

This place has recently been updated since the days of Green Mango, but not entirely.  The badly stained upholstered benches still remain amongst chairs with faded gold elephants. 

You can make your way to the back for cafeteria style serving.

For $11 bucks you get a lot of food.  I saved half of it for later.
You are able to choose one meat or vegetation option with pad thai/rice.  It comes with a spring roll, coleslaw, and a drink.

That's a lot of food.

*The pad thai was a bit over-cooked and sticky-soggy, with sliced carrots and broccoli.
*The peanut chicken was a thick peanut sauce with a few pieces of chicken and slightly cooked green beans.  Tasty, heavy, and sweet but not a lot of chicken.
*The spring roll was alright.  I sort of like the spring rolls at Ginger more.

If you have a craving for Thai food and you are in the Yonge and Bloor area, this place does the trick!  

However, I can't say it's even close to being one of my favourite places for Thai in the city. 

I'll be back though."}
{"text":"It's not really the fanciest of places, but the prices are reasonable and the food is good. It's very difficult to find good Thai food in Toronto but this has become my go-to Thai resto since moving from the Annex. Recommended if you're looking for fast, inexpensive pad Thai!"}
{"text":"I order here for lunch when I crave for some thai food. They are pretty authentic and their food are pretty damn spicy.  Price is decent for Yorkville area and portion is fair.  I have never eaten in so I am not sure how the service is."}
{"text":"Formally Green Mango which was a more friendly place, it now seems to try too hard. While the quality of the food is slightly better and more authentic and I do mean authentic, Ive been to Thailand, this food is real. Personally I just don't find it as welcoming or busy.  
 
I truly feel this place is under rated and while I am hard wiith my review, it is really very good for this level of food and service.

I would stop by for a quick and easy lunch, when it was Green Mango, sometimes I would head downtown specifically to go there. For me it has gone from being a destination to a drop in when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fell upon this place once with my man who insisted we try it. Large dining room which was less than full. Server was very attentive and service was quick. I ordered the authentic pad Thai sans egg crepe and the man had peanut chicken. Great flavour and prices. We now order take out from there regularly and I'd recommend you do too."}
{"text":"My husband and I were strolling around Toronto recently and we were hungry at the end of our 10km walk.  We saw a poster in Na Siam's window advertising a $9.95 Dinner Special.  I am always up for some cheap Thai food, so we went in.

The place is clean and the server greeted us right away.  We were served water as soon as we sat down and given menus.  The menus we were given were the regular menus, there was no mention of this \"Dinner Special\" so I asked about it.  The server then came back with the \"Dinner Special\" menu.  Several people came in after us and I noticed the same thing.  They only gave the \"Dinner Special\" menu to those who asked about it.  Now I understand that a restaurant's goal is to maximize profits (i.e. get people to order from the more expensive regular menu), so intellectually I do not fault the restaurant for this business practice, but emotionally, I felt that it was sneaky.   

The Dinner Special is an awesome deal.  You get a starter salad (coleslaw), a spring roll, a choice of main dish, a side of either Pad Thai or steamed rice, and a glass of soda pop, all for just $9.95.  I don't remember all the main dish choices, but they included Peanut Chicken, Cashew Chicken, Spicy Beef, Chicken Curry, and I'm sure some vegetarian dishes.  

I had the Spicy Beef with Pad Thai and my husband had the Cashew Chicken with Pad Thai.  The starter salad was shredded cabbage and carrots in a sweet vinaigrette with crushed peanuts.  The veggies were fresh and the coleslaw was tasty.  I do not believe that the vinaigrette had fish sauce in it, or if it did, it was very mild because it was not fishy at all.  I don't like fish sauce, so this is why I'm mentioning it.

The spring roll was pretty standard.  It was vegetarian with mostly cabbage and vermicelli.  It was hot and crispy and not overly greasy.

The Pad Thai was just noodles, a small amount of bean sprouts (hurray because I hate Pad Thai that is mostly bean sprouts), and a small amount of green onions in a sweet and tangy sauce.  There is no protein in the Pad Thai side (i.e. no eggs, tofu, etc.).  As a side dish, it was delicious and complemented the main dishes well.  The Spicy Beef was true to its name spicy.  Tender beef slices sauteed with green peppers, bamboo, onions and basil leaves.  Delicious.  The Cashew Chicken was mild but still flavourful.  It had peppers, carrots, onions, and of course cashew nuts.

The pop is a fountain drink not a can or bottle.  

The server was very soft spoken and polite.  English was clearly not her first language, but this did not detract from her ability to provide excellent service.  She refilled our waters when they were nearing empty without prompting and brought us our bill quickly when we asked for it.  She checked up on us throughout the meal and was generally pleasant.  

Great service, food is good and cheap.  I would go back.

Now I noticed that Yelp labels this restaurant as being in the \"Yorkville\" neighbourhood.  People who live in Toronto or are from Toronto definitely know better, but if you are a tourist reading this review and looking for a romantic dinner in tony Yorkville and can't believe your luck that you found a Yorkville restaurant where you can have dinner for 2 for less than $30, I hate to burst your bubble, but this restaurant is not really in Yorkville.  It is in real estate parlance \"Yorkville-adjacent.\"  It is across the street from the Brass Rail, which is a strip club.  Enough said."}
{"text":"This was a disappointment. Me and a friend went here for lunch, and when we walked in we weren't really sure what to do. There is a steam table at the front, so the place seemed to be a take-out joint. We found out that we could sit down and order off the main menu as well, which is what we did. 

While my friend's pineapple fried rice dish was fine, my own basil beef dish was a disaster. The dish was INCREDIBLY SPICEY. I literally had tears in my eyes and felt like I was on the show Fear Factor or something. I have no idea how a \"basil beef\" dish was one of the spiciest dishes I'd ever had. I had to force myself to finish it because I was hungry. 

If you're going to make a dish that is a killer like that, you need to make that known on the menu. Use one of those hot pepper signs or something. I absolutely DIDN'T enjoy my meal because of how spicey it was. 

Service was mediocre at best too. I had to go to the washroom and fill up my water bottle in order to cool off my mouth with water. 

At least for lunch, this is more appropriate for a take-out place rather than a sit-down resto. My bad experience though will probably mean I won't give it another shot. Ginger is across the street, and I've had consistently tasty meals there at a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"this place can be easily lost among all the other thai/cninese place along yonge next to bloor, but look for it anyway.

they always have some special offers that they post on their facebook page along with coupons for discounts. it doesn't make the food worse. 
I actually found the food to be pretty thai good and yummy.

it's cheap (thanks to all the offers) and the staff is friendly.

can't say if it ever gets packed as I only went there once and it was half empty (maybe sunday night might explain that...)"}
{"text":"I grabbed dinner here last week.  The service was good and cheerful, and they've put some money into the decor.  I ordered the curry pad thai, which was so sweet I didn't end up finishing it.  The noodle texture was good, but what's with the sugar?  If I'm in the area, I might stop by and try something else."}
{"text":"More like YA Siam! Best Thai delivery/takeout in the neighbourhood.

Tamarind Fish (that sauce could make an old Rolodex taste good) and street style Pad Thai or Pad See Ew are my regular cast members, though the Red Curry and Eggplant & Tofu have pretty much graduated from guest-starring roles as well. They have many options for veggies and pescies.

At $10-14 per flavourful dish, I don't think it's a great deal at regular price, but if you have a discount and you plan on having Thai for your next 3 meals, it's totally worth it.

I've never eaten in and probably never will. But they've been really quick for both pickup and delivery, and I've been really quick devouring those dinners in an almost frightening manner."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. Combo's are big and they are okay price, however each time I try a combo with rice/noodles and some fish/meat, it is always too greasy and wet.  

I do like the taste, but I always feel sick afterwards, so I have a feeling there's a lot of MSG on their product.  I tried  5-6 times since the Green Mango days and I've given up now.  I would rather have Thai Express than this place."}
{"text":"I thought it was ok. Nothing special. There are definitely better Thai restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit for lunch, when you walk up to the counter cafeteria-style and order your choice of noodles/rice, choice of and number of dishes, and salad. The food is decent. The dining room is large and clean and faces Yonge Street, including the two-storey sign of a '90s brunette suspended on the face of the Brass Rail across the street. I've never been here for dinner, when I'm told they have table-side service. It's a good, standard place for lunch. For two items on rice/noodles and a salad, expect to pay just shy of $9."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bizarre combination of fast food and menu based.   You can choose to order from a full size menu, or you can head to the back of the restaurant which is setup like a food court where the food is pre-made, you take a tray and your own cutlery, and pay before you head to your table.  

Since my friend and I were starving from a shopping expedition at Yonge and Bloor, we went with the fast food option.  You can select a 1, 2, or 3 item combination plate (also comes with rice or pad thai noodles) for $7, $8, or $9.   For the most part the food was good, and the portion size was excellent.   The noodles were great, the basil shrimp was very tasty and spicy, but the chicken was dry and flavourless (both from my friend's cashew chicken and my lemongrass chicken).

Free self serve water from a cooler is available.

Overall, satisfying and a great price."}
{"text":"Good food.  Friendly staff.  I usually order the Penang chicken curry which is a dish I cannot find often in aToronto Thai restaurants and which I love.  I also order Wonton Soup which is good in a bland sort of way.  Also what I have ordered is some basil eggplant dish which is not bad. So as I am writing this I went from 4 stars to 3 stars because the one thing i really liked is the penang curry, the other two dishes were just ok. If i try more dishes and like them maybe I will up the star rating.  But really I would recommend this place overall.  Large menu selection and I do have this impression that the chef is good."}
{"text":"I have just finised my meal...like I'm sitting here still.  Good? Definitley.  Portions may look small but they aren't I'm quite full.  So price? I had a coupon for 15 off and the total was...16.

2 entrees (go for pad thai)
1 tea, 1 mango juice

I had panang curry not bad but I've haD better.  

The one star off is because the service, as nice as it is, is slow!!! 40 mins for my meal to come. 

Still good food though!"}
{"text":"Visited Na Siam after a gym session because it was highly recommended by my peers. When my friend and I walked in, my first thought was, \"this place is dead! And it's a Friday night!\" But I ventured in anyway and took a seat. A really nice gentleman greeted us and brought us some water and menus. My friend and I skimmed through the menu, and rather than get what I always order when I eat Thai food (green curry); I decided to be adventurous and ordered the Panang curry for $10.95. I also ordered the Tom-Yum (Lemongrass Soup) for $5.95. 

Verdict:

Tom-Yum soup was tasty, though I really did not like the huge pieces of raw tomatoes taking up 30% of the bowl. Once you removed the tomatoes, you had only about one cup of soup left. Also, rather than have several large pieces of lemongrass that you could pick out, or have the chef remove before serving, you got a lot of tiny pieces of lemongrass with every spoonful. I love the flavor of lemongrass, but I am not a fan of chewing on it. 

The Panang curry was too sweet. In order to eat it I had to drown in hot sauce and rice. Unfortunately, the curry comes with a very small side of rice, so you have no choice but to order more rice for an extra $2. 

All in all, the dinner was not a complete bust. If the curry was not on the verge of qualifying as a dessert, and if I did not have to remove chunks of tomatoes from my soup while I chewed on lemongrass, the experience would have been alright. But with so many Thai options in the Yonge and Bloor area, I don't think I will be returning to Na Siam. 

Oh, and one more thing. They have dinner combos that the staff failed to mention to us. The combo comes with a curry/pad thai, a spring roll, a side and pop for under $11. Yes, it would have been lovely to know this before my friend and I ordered."}
{"text":"The stretch of Yonge Street between Bloor and Dundas is a checker board of sex shops, head shops, off-brand clothing and shoe shops, and fast food outlets in varying states of decomposition.  

Na Siam nurtures greater hopes.  In a former life, it was the Green Mango, one of many pretenders to Salad King's throne as the best cheap Thai spot in town. Noted for it's affordable steam table specials, the Mango closed for \"Renovations\" last year, and emerged from it's construction cocoon with a new name, and possibly new ownership. 

And man, the new place tries hard. Gone is the traditional food court seating, replaced by swanky banquettes and richly upholstered chairs.  The room is actually pretty now. If Thai's your thing it's a civilized place to spend ones lunch hour. 

The steam table remains, but now it rides alongside table service. This makes for uneasy conversations with harried waitstaff, who look after those who order from the menu, but ignore and sometimes glare at the self-help dining set.  Note to self: Unless you plan on tipping, DO NOT ask for water. 

Perhaps in a nod to competition from Khao San Road, Na Siam has recently introduced their version of Khao Soi; egg noodles with chicken in a vibrant yellow curry sauce, topped with more noodles, this time crisply fried. It's fine, but brings more sweet than heat-a recurrent theme at Na Siam. 

Thai food revolves around four basic flavours: hot, sour, salty and sweet. Done well, each bite achieves a slightly different but pleasing balance. I err on the savoury side, so given a chance I will ask for less sugar and more chili. Bellied up to the steam table here, I ask for whatever's least sweet.  The answer changes by day. Basil Chicken, Tomato Tofu, a range of curry options and spicy noodles rather than ketchuppy pad Thai usually find their way on my plate. Spring rolls are crisp and tightly wrapped, but parsimoniously filled. Noodles are a highlight; mildly spiked with chili and a fair helping of  the usual veggie suspects. Golden curry has great depth of flavour, but as mentioned could use less sugar and more fire. Ditto for basil chicken, which is fragrant but lacks a flavour punch. Shrimp dishes and fried rice just look sad. Satays are terrific when fresh; all springy texture, set for dunking in standard-issue peanut sauce. Left to sit for a while, they're tough and chewy and just shy enough of hot to raise the spectre of food-borne illness.  Tea is offered, but it's tough to linger over a cup during a rushed lunch hour. 

Signs in the window promise better specials with table service, and staff pushes new items and dinner options if you feel like a fix later in the evening. In some respects, Na Siam would be better off further downtown or uptown, either as a late night greasy-noodle fix or a bedroom community takeout stop. At the corner of Bloor and Yonge, it has yet to find the right fit."}
