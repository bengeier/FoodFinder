{"text":"Walking by on Ste Catherine, it was difficult for this restaurant to remain unnoticed. We were hungry and Palme did not disappoint.
Its terrace and beautiful interior made us feel comfortable and relax right away. A very positive vibe that was confirmed with lovely staff's greetings.
Our group had some restricted diets. They explained all possible options and came up with solutions that suited everybody's tastes.
We knew the food was about to be served because we could smell delicious spices coming out of the kitchen.
I had the \"lamb shank\" with spices on top (they can make it non-spicy) served with an eggplant caviar and a Caribbean salad to eat with soft tacos. It was perfectly cooked and harmonized. Very satisfying for a lamb lover...
My friends had the \"Mac n Cheese\" that they found excellent and spicy, and the \"risotto croquette with black beans and goat cheese with a market salad and spicy tomato velouté\" that they made vegetarian for us (picture). This latter was exceptional, flavours were perfectly combined... an awesome tropical storm wandered into our mouths!
I strongly recommend you to try Palme if you feel like discovering new flavours. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Les accras sont excellents et le poulet jerk est à s'en lécher les doigts!"}
{"text":"Le jerk chicken était très bon et bien épicé le poisson vivaneau avec la sauce du chef était bon aussi. Le soir où nous avons était les serveurs étaient débordés et ça été un peu long mais le resto venait d'ouvrir alors le staff va s'améliorer."}
{"text":"I was flabbergasted by the concept and ingredients Palme put together. Green Papaya Salad topped with Tuna Tataki, for example. Who would've thought they'd complement each other very well? Well, this dish can be improved with a squeeze of lime or lemon. It needs to be a little more acidic. Same goes for Grilled Red Snapper. It lacks citrus flavor which would have complemented the fresh fish. 

On the other hand, Conch Ceviche was spot on! Make sure you have it with fried plantain and a tiny bite of green chili. 

Grapefruit Cocktail was amazing. It was crafted with a lot of ingredients, and it came out very good!

We were in a rush, so we didn't get to try their desserts, but we'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is simple yet elegant. Super aesthetically pleasing and gives off a classy Caribbean vibe. Love it.

FOOD: Amazing. I had the lamb and jerk chicken. The meats were all fall-off-the-bone tender, juicy and packed full of flavor. The spices blended amazingly with their respective sides. The chicken came with fried mac and cheese! And the lamb came with a homemade eggplant mash which was incredible as well. The plates should be shared for maximal taste bud explosion. 

PRICE: A tad bit on the expensive side but it's not as bad a steakhouse! For the quality that you're getting, the prices are very reasonable. I'd say it ranges from 16-24$.

SERVICE: Amazing. The waiter was super attentive, took the time to explain the menu and was super friendly in general. Even the chef took the time out to come see and thank us."}
