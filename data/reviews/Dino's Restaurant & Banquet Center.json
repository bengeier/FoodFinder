{"text":"Just returned from an extended family birthday party for my aunt's 95th birthday party. So impressed with the food and service.  Chicken Marsala was fantastic, crispy outside and juicy inside. Roast beef was outstanding, not typical overcooked gray tough stuff but perfectly cooked and flavorful. Cavatelles perfect. Friendly staff especially considering it was a Sunday 11:30 start.  These folks know foodservice!
Very highly recommended, keep doing what your doing."}

{"text":"It's at a Day's Inn, and I wasn't expecting much, but I had a decent pasta dinner at the bar & it didn't have the usual down-and-out motel restaurant vibe -- it was crowded, with a 40th bday party in the corner and lots of people drinking and having a good time -- this may reflect well on Dino's or poorly on the area but I was pleasantly surprised.  And the ravioli, garlic marinara & italian sausage were all fine -- they are serious about the garlic -- fortunately I am driving alone."}
{"text":"Nice place in Mentor...
It's one of those places that seems to be stuck in the 70s in terms of it's looks. However, they serve you good, delicious and inexpensive food fairly quickly. Try their Calamari or any of their pasta's. Also, fantastically cheap drinks here! 

Not a bad place to unwind after work."}
{"text":"not that great...as an old Dino's II customer I went in there looking for a steak, whick used to be great and was disappointed, my wife had a Caprese salad, also not that great..place needs refresh too...."}
{"text":"I was a guest at Dino's on 8/16/08. I was directed by Dino's staff to park in a back lot as the primary parking was full. Following the reception, I obtained a hotel room and did not return to my car until morning. The lot I'd parked in is Lakeland Community College property. As a consequence, my car was ticketed and towed (173 dollars). I contacted Pat, the owner and manager of Dino's, who laughed into the phone and told me he and his staff are in no way responsible for my inability to read a poorly placed \"no overnight parking\" sign (Sign is to the right of entrance, I parked to the left). Had I not been directed to the lot, I never would have parked there. Pat was disrespectful and confrontational during our phone conference. He made no attempt at amending the situation. Based simply on his treatment of people in this unfortunate circumstance, I would never recommend this restaurant. Take your business to someone who cares about their clientele."}
{"text":"Making food in bulk amounts is no easy task, but Dino's does it Italian and does it well. 

This past weekend, we had my boyfriend's son's football banquet here and the food far surpassed my expectations. Having grown up in the area, I was wondering why I couldn't place where Dino's actually was--but once we pulled up, I remembered seeing it tons of times. 

Unassuming, and a little beat up on the outside, once you walk in, this huge restaurant and banquet facility is packed to the gills with people seeking the warm comforts of homemade Italian noms. It's much nicer on the inside, but still a little dated. 

Our banquet room was large, again a little dated with carpeting and very kitschy decor. The food came out family-style and the front runners were definitely the cavatelli and the meatballs. The cavatelli tasted freshly-made and the sauce was very rich, more on the smooth side. The meatballs were tender, moist and seasoned really well--again, these too tasted homemade. They also served up chicken with a wine sauce, which was just OK, not bad but it has a nice, grilled taste to it. I didn't taste the pan roasted potatoes but the green beans were average. I'd definitely come back just for the cavatelli and meatballs alone. Lastly, the salad the served was a little soggy since they pre-tossed it with what seemed like a creamy Italian dressing. It would have been much better without that dressing. 

Overall, a great choice for homemade Italian food in Mentor, especially for large groups, events and/or catering. I'd definitely check it out."}
