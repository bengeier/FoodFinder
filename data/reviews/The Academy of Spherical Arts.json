{"text":"When looking for a birthday venue that would please a group covering the gamut of 30-somethings to 80-somethings, I did some research on Yelp and came across The Academy (showing you business owners that it actually does do wonders for attracting or detracting new business).

We met for dinner on a Friday night and were seated at a large round table by one of the big windows overlooking Liberty Village. The interior was stunning with its classic combination of bricks and beams, artwork strewn on the walls, and vintage pool tables (hence the \"spherical arts\" bit).

The service was fast and friendly but not intrusive or rushed, and the food was delicious. I ordered the special, Red Curry Red Snapper, which was perfectly cooked and served with rice and crispy asparagus. My husband was feeling adventurous and tried the Cajun Seared Alligator, and my mother had the Tequila Mahi Mahi which was beautifully presented.

The menu is diverse enough to please just about any palette, but not overwhelming in its options. I can see how it would make a perfect wedding or special events venue."}
{"text":"They have a great brunch!  Been there a few times for brunch/ lunch and enjoyed every time.

Delicious food, reasonably priced, nice bright environment, friendly & helpful staff.

Will try their dinner some day soon."}
{"text":"I visited the side entrance room (John Weelington room or something) and it is a lovely space. I was the only one in it at 630pm on a wed nite... Lovely exposed brick, ornate gorgeous pool tables, comfy red couches... very old English feel with a modern lounge mix. 
Why I only gave it 3 stars is because they only have 5 crappy beers on tap (unless you like Heineken, tank house, and the like. 
Friendly bar tender
Empty at 7 still.
Cant tell you much more as I left after that (slightly intoxicated i might add).
I think this is the type of place people rent out for parties as oppossed to a place to drop in for a pint (unless your with a group of friends).
I could be totally wrong as well, so dont pay any attention to this review"}
{"text":"I've never been here with a large group, or when it was busy at all, but the space seems like it would be amazing packed with people playing pool, hanging around the hammered-copper bar in the corner, milling about all the rooms. Initially, I thought the atmosphere a little off - like a river casino targeting 20-somethings - but it's actually quite clean, cozy, and genuine. I haven't put my finger on it yet, but something about the decor is not quite right. Maybe it's just a little tired.

The hosts are friendly, service quite good (though I've had the same waitress all four times I've been there, so I can't vouch for the whole staff), and the food is surprisingly good. I say surprising, because this place feels less like a restaurant than a venue, despite the sea of white tablecloths and neat placesettings. I wasn't expecting much, but after having tried several dishes (an amazingly delicate mushroom gnocchi stands out) and received very good wine recommendations, I have to send virtual compliments to the chef. 

Obviously the Academy is fantastic for large groups, but a quiet lunch with your date by one of the big windows with a view of the tower is a really good option."}
{"text":"I agree the space is nice.  But the food?  Attended a party there and the best meal anyone had was pasta .... The rest weren't good at all. In fact I had something from the part of the menu featuring \"the sea\"  and lets just say that it had been a mighty long time since that bass had seen any sea time.   What's grosser than way-not-fresh fish?   Maybe the usual chef was away but i sure would not go back there to eat."}
{"text":"Never even knew this place existed but went for Brunch with 4 people and it was very very good .  The waiter told me this was Toronto's best kept secret and I think he is right (Can't be good for business ??)  Great food, the place is huge, very nice rooms, has an old Loft feel to it - would be an awesome place to host a party - definitely going back at some point."}
{"text":"Great pool hall, great beer selection (one of the few places I can find Tusker). Sadly it's always booked for special events.  I was there last week and was relegated to the basement because of a private party. The ambience in the basement isn't as good as the rest if the facility."}
{"text":"Lovely! Came here for a brunch with friends after their high praises, and was pleasantly surprised. It's a hidden gem for a brunch (like, REALLY hidden, we were the only people in the entire place) but they do a great job with the comfortable atmosphere and good food. I had the oat crusted french toast, which is amazingly delicious but very filling (I took half of it home). The eggs benny was also a good choice. Overall, their food was great, and their service was alright (thought for being the only table in the place, I could've used a water refill every now and then).

It has a good vibe for brunch, especially since the place has lots of windows so it's bright and cheery. The pool tables throw it off, but they at least give you something to do while you're waiting for your food. 

I'd love to come back, but I kind of wish this place was more lively."}
{"text":"1. I hosted my rehearsal brunch here and the breakfast was DELICIOUS! I ordered the smoked salmon with eggs and potato hash and it was incredibly good breakfast food.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very relaxed.  Wonderful venue for casual dining and special occasions!

2. I also had my wedding here and it is such a beautiful and unique venue! The staff and service were absolutely wonderful and the food was delicious! Everyone was very accommodating and our guests LOVED the space. Thank you so much! Haley, the venue's event coordinator, was terrific! She really helped us plan and organize our special day!"}
{"text":"I do not play pool. I do not like pool. I will play randomly if I felt compelled to or more realistically, my partner asked me to play as there was no one else. So for me to go, willingly, to a pool hall was pretty far off the map. This was obviously a special circumstance. I had a big birthday party to attend. This birthday included its own DJ, a live band that played for 1 hour and appetizers galore. Oh ya, did I forget to mention the ONE free pitcher of fun-punch and non-fun-punch that we got...

But this place was great for holding a party or gathering. There was probably a constant 70-80 people and there seem to be a lack of seating but it wasn't a big problem as more than half of the guests were dancing, playing pool or just socializing. 

The staff was amazing. Every one of them was very helpful and the platters of appetizers were constantly flowing. The dishes weren't even empty and there was already a fresh one coming exploding with items to consume. There were also some other cooked appetizers that servers were going around offering which was nice but some of the things were quite messy (ie. pizza with loose toppings) but they did come armed with napkins that would be large to squirrel. 

The food was...decent. Nothing special but nothing so great that I would specifically travel there to eat. The pizza that was served was very good but a little bit too thick for my liking. The alcohol selection is vast. They are known to have the largest selection of scotch in the city! So scotch lovers, this is your heaven/hell, whichever you choose.

Having the pool tables there was a great way for people to bond over and it's not just a 2 player game, there would be teams of people going up against each other. It was a great ice breaker for those that didn't know each other that well and it kept your hands busy so there was no fidgeting. The pool tables were all different colours and had a very distinct design on them. They were wood with carvings on the bottom. They looked great and were very rustic which fit right in with the decor of the room. Wooden floors, wooden pool tables, chairs, all looking very rustic but not tacky or old, even the lounge chairs and counches were something that came out of an antique show. 

I know that I have quite the skewed view since coming as a patron on a regular night is quite different than coming to a private party with a DJ and band playing but this is one of the best venues that I've been to for throwing a big bash. It's not the traditional banquet hall style, it's more laid back and fun with pool tables thrown in for kicks. Great place to gather, although it is a bit costly to rent out your own room, bringing a bunch of friends to hang out will be just as good as having your own private area."}
{"text":"Spherical arts = pool!  Ah, I get it!

Great atmosphere: floor to ceiling bar, antique pool tables, 2 rooms, loungey areas with comfy chairs. Easy parking on the street or at the supermarket parking lot down the street.  They filmed the pilot episode of the short-lived TV series \"Wonderfalls\" here...I loved the show so naturally, visiting the bar was really cool.  Just a great chill place to hang out.

Drinks:  HUGE beer list and liquor selection, nice selections of Canadian beer.

I didn't get a chance to try the food but the menu sounded delicious.  I tried to go here for lunch but it was closed for a function so I came back the next day to have a pre-dinner drink.  If I'm in the Toronto area again, I wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the years, and have always liked it.  It's more expensive than grabbing lunch elsewhere near work, but it's great for a special occasion.  I brought a couple of coworkers there for a birthday lunch on Friday, which is their buffet lunch day.  The selection was great, with many different dishes to choose from, lots of vegetarian options (for those that care about that sort of thing), a variety of salads, cheeses, desserts, teas, etc.  They have dishes ranging from the standard roast beef to cauliflower and cheese to fish to Indian-style dishes.  The only downside is the dishes are not labeled so you are left guessing what the mystery food is ... a little difficult for someone like me who does not like seafood.  I would recommend the cauliflower and cheese, this one roast beef dish they had, and this one cake with I think pears and caramel in it.  The server we had was friendly and helpful, and since it is usually not that crowded (when there are no events booked) the atmosphere was quiet and relaxing.  We have also been there for events over the years and it is a great venue, with good food, friendly servers, and of course the pool tables.  I love the atmosphere with the old building and all the old furniture. This is not the cheapest of lunch options in the area but I would definitely recommend it for special occasions, for entertaining clients, or for special events."}
{"text":"One of a kind. What pool halls combine premium vintage snooker tables, truly superb food (not a wings and nachos joint!) and a stunning architectural space? Miss the old days when the cigars would break out after dinner! Have been here for several weddings (both buffet, sit down) and am always stunned by how good the food is. Everyone else loves the pool and I just love to sit on the plentiful loungers and admire the beautifully restored tables. It's huge and cozy at the same time... how do they do that?"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 11 people, a mixture of co-workers and clients.  It was a weeknight and one room was closed for a private party.  

I must say, the food was excellent.  The special was blackened salmon and it was fantastic.  Several in our party had the beef tenderloin and commented on how good it was.  No one had a bad thing to say about any of the food.  First rate and I'd go back for a meal in a heartbeat.

The downside was the service.  Our waiter was a 35 year old curmudgeon.  He acted like it was a pain in the rear to serve us.  Snarky comments muttered under his breath, not enough menus or bread plates to go around (which he didn't rectify, even when asked politely), lots of eye rolling and a general bad attitude.  We were jammed into a table that should have set 8.  We had one person sitting at the actual corner of the table.  Seeing that there was only one other party of 2 in the room we were in, we went ahead and pulled another 4 top over to give everyone room.  This was met with a comment from our waiter about how that table was to be used by him when he brought our food out.  

The place has a fantastic vibe, and great decor.  I'd go back again, but would be mindful of the one bad apple."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm ohhhhhhhh !!! Little pricey ! But so worth it :))) food amazing .. Atmosphere is really cool .. Nice big open space !  Will be going back again and again :))"}
