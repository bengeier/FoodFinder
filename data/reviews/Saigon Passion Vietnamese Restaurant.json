{"text":"Saigon passion is the best vietnamese food I've had in my life. The size of portions they give you, while not as large as they were in the past, are still huge. The service is prompt, friendly, and accurate. I'm all about the vermicelli and salad rolls, and this place makes the best of both of them. Try it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times so I'm definitely a fan.  They have a huge variety of food here but there's only a few select dishes that are actually good.

First of all, I wouldn't recommend pho here. It's not great because there are other dishes here that are better.  The people that gave this place a bad rating is probably because they ordered the wrong items such as pho.  If you want good pho, go elsewhere.  If you want vermicelli, go anywhere as they all taste pretty much the same to me.

We come here for the rolls (the kind where you roll yourself) and some specialty items like banh xeo.  Until I find another place that has better specialty items such as this, I'll continue to drive all the way from the NW just to have it.  It's that good.

Ambiance +1 star
Food +2 stars
I would come back +1 star"}
{"text":"Amazing every time! Customer service is always exceptional, their staff are all super polite on the phone and in person. I have only ever ordered #604 but have had it many, many times. If you want fantastic soft noodles, get them from here! :)"}
{"text":"Not my fave Viet place, but super convenient for me so it's a bonus. They have the traditional rice plates and noodle bowls, but my go to dish here is the Bun Bo Hue. Not too spicy, broth is flavourful and they use the proper Bun Bo noodles (I've had it at places that serve it with pho or vermicelli noodles - no thanks!)

Decent prices and satisfies your Viet cravings."}
{"text":"Amazing food the chicken satay soup broth is so good !! Grilled Chicken salad rolls fantastic !! Great service from very friendly staff !!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick take out or dine in, the spicy seafood soup is brilliant"}
{"text":"Definitely a mistake going to this restaurant, and it's left a sour mark on my Calgary experience (visiting from the US).

The food was GROSS. My food and my parents' food all tasted bad and the entrees definitely wasn't authentic Vietnamese cooking. The service was very lacking and inattentive of our group. Would definitely protest ever coming back to this place."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Vietnamese restaurant in CGY.  Price is fair and portions are very generous..   These are some of the dishes I enjoy or have tasted :)

{"text":"Very good foods, very authentic, the rice paper wrap dishes are awesome.
The only cons are sometime too noisy from the kitchen, we can hear everything.
Would give a 4 - 4.5 for the good foods.Thanks!"}
{"text":"Been there several times both for lunch with colleagues, and with family/friends, great tasting food but service is very slow and you have to flag employees down later to get the bill, so not the best place to go to between work hours. Decor and music cheesy, but again sometimes the best foods are found in the worst places!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, for a vietnamese place, I would have to recommend passing on their pho. Their broth isnt quite on par as the other places nearby. I would recommend getting #901. It is a self roll dish that comes with veggies and rice papers. Meats are great and its def enough to feed possibly 2, depending on the hunger level. Bun and Com toms are also worth a try as well. 
Service is good. Quick to arrive. Not sure if I'm crazy about their set up with the booths. i just feel like a lab rat running thru a maze. Overall, I'd come back for #901."}
{"text":"I have eaten here so many times and can not get enough of their BUN BO HUE! It's honestly my favourite (if you like spicy) in all of Calgary next to song huong Vietnamese restaurant and I have tried bun bo hue at over 20 different Vietnamese restaurants. I also love their do it yourself wraps! The owner is super sweet she sometimes comes out from the kitchen to just say hi to her customers and the workers there remember me every time"}
