{"text":"We have ordered twice and once was great.  The second time was not good.  The tuna was brown, did not smell right and did not taste like tuna.. it had spots in it also"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi with beautiful presentation! I highly recommend JPs. I have been a Jia enthusiast for years but I've found a new favorite place. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere nice but relaxed. One member of our group did not order sushi. She ordered Pad Thai with shrimp. It was wonderful - just the right amount of spice for us.  If you like super spicy food you may need them to add some heat. The staff was friendly and service oriented. Give JO's House a try, I think you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has top of the line everything, from the decor to the excellent staff and the food was very yummy.  My daughter and I loved it.  It's a really nice place to bring a date.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and you can communicate easily with other people in the party.

Loved the fried calamari with the sweet and sour sauce.  I also loved the filet mignon with lobster, kind of expensive but the food is divine.

This place does a lot of small things like the way the food is presented with a flower.  I thought that was a nice touch.

This place is more expensive than Sake but the food is so much better, plus at JP's you get the full dining experience. 

Give this place a chance you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Met my wife here for lunch. It seemed slow but it was a little later then lunch. She got the hibachi chicken and I got the teriyaki steak bento box. Both were great. Staff was friendly. The only odd spot was that we ordered a cheesecake for our kids to split, my daughter said the key lime pie was great. So I tasted it. It was key lime pie which was good but also not listed on the menu. Odd but only fault I could find. Happy it's right down the road."}
{"text":"The lunch hibachi chicken was very good. We will be coming back for more! This was our first time here."}
{"text":"I was blown out of the water!!!!!  Food was exceptional and a work of art.   No comparison to the dry and flavorless other Japanese take out places in town.  Beef is tender, sushi was fabulous.  Can't wait to try everything!!!!  Give them a try!!! Yes they are a little higher than other places but the difference is very evident in the taste of their amazing food.   Superb service"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and hibachi take out.  Close to south Gastonia neighborhoods.  Excellent food, good portions.  Very easy to use and accurate online ordering.  Will use again."}
{"text":"My number one go to Japanese restaurant since it came to Gastonia! The service is awesome, if you have issues with your food they are quick to make it right. The sushi is also DELISH!! I have business meetings here along with personal with family and friends. Everyone always wants to come back!"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch. The hibachi lunch was the perfect size. And the ginger dressing is so good! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. The lunch prices are comparable to Sake Express restaurants, but the food is so much better. The dinner prices are almost double Sake, but the portions were almost doubled as well.

I had the beef bento box both for lunch and dinner. I was a little hesitant because the dinner prices was a lot more, but they added more of the same type of food as before, plus new things. The new things were awesome. All the food was very tasty. Presentation was the best I've had for a bento box.

My wife had hibachi chicken for lunch and filet mignon for dinner. She said both were very tasty. I tried the filet mignon and it was mouth watering-  perfectly cooked.

Not a sushi person, so haven't tried that. I believe different sushi is their main \"dish\", but the grill stuff is just as great.

Soup was good. Salad with ginger dressing was so-so. I've had better and worse. But doesn't overshadow overall experience.

Service is fast and friendly. Small place. Decor is modern and clean. Will definitely come again and hope they stay around."}
{"text":"Got take-out on a quiet and cold Wednesday night! Restaurant was very clean with a lovely staff. Food was ready as soon as I arrived. Got home and open my takeout bag and was completely WOWed-- beautiful presentation (even in to-go containers) with huge portions. Enough to take for a hearty lunch tomorrow. Entree comes with salad and miso soup as well a rice and vegetables. We were very pleased with the quality of the food; great value for all that you receive. So glad to have this new spot nearby!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Asian restaurant in the area! Food is ALWAYS delicious. We have only ever gotten take out but we have never had any issues. The portion on the hibachi is enough for dinner one night and lunch the next day, and the prices are fair. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I read the reviews for this place and decided to try it out.  I'm really surprised how high some people rank mediocre food. The quality of the chicken isn't great (texture is gross) pad Thai noodles were way too soft. My wife had the beef fried rice and it was about average but not bad. They should maybe charge less with this quality. I would not compare this to Jia or  Thai house there is no comparison. If I get desperate I'll maybe try again and if it's better I will update this review."}
{"text":"Update- have been back two more times since original post. Excellent food and service both times. The hibachi/teriyaki dishes are what we expected similar to what other local restaurants have to offer only much better. Comes with both small soup and salad. Then the main course (we had shrimp/chicken combo) were large portions, cooked perfectly and comes with a side of sautéed veggies instead of the candied carrots.  I preferred the veggies over the carrots!  Also tried several appetizers and sushi dishes. Everything is always fast, fresh, excellently presented. Staff is very attentive. I give it 5 stars across the board!
Great food!  Very nice presents!!Great service!!!  Didn't try the sushi -but will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Recently went for dinner. Staff was very nice and food was delicious!  The JPs House Roll is now one of my top 5 favorite sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service! Comfortable atmosphere. Great tasting food! Decent prices. Loved it and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!! The service here is phenomenal! Our waitress was the most friendly human being I've ever encountered. I had the spongebob sushi and it was tasty. My husband had the lobster, scallops and shrimp hibachi and they cooked it to perfection. The veggies were sautéed very well and the \"yum yum\" sauce they have here is my favorite. Go and try this place out! You will love it!!"}
{"text":"On our first visit, we were seated promptly in a busy open restaurant. Not really an atmosphere for a quiet, date-night dinner.I ordered Shrimp Benito box,  my friend ordered Chicken Teriyaki. Our soup and salads come out quickly,  both good.  Then it seemed like quite a wait for our main course.  My shrimp was overcooked and chewy tough. I loved the spring roll. Really good and the best thing in the box. I thought the tempera was gummy and not very crisp. Our waitress, or lack thereof, was never seen again until check time. We asked other waiters for drink refills. And once the check was dropped off, we finally left the $ and walked out."}
{"text":"I am not going to wait another second to share my experience with you.  SHUT UP!!!  This restaurant is INCREDIBLE!  So far we have eaten:

Seafood soup
Dumpling soup
Tuna tartar
Tuna tataki 
Yellow tail hamachi combo
Fried udon noodle
Fried fish head AND
Sashimi

Oh, there are only 3 if us

I would bathe in Jimmy's secret sauce!
I would eat here everyday of the week and twice on Sunday !  I have to stop writing, must eat

See you soon!"}
