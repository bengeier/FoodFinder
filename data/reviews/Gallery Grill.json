{"text":"service here is wonderful and the food is divine!  the meat plates are excellent and so are the desserts.  pasta here is not your finest italian, but everything else is delicious!"}
{"text":"A gem ! 

 Gallery Grill just opened cocktail hour - well priced, from-scratch drinks in a luxurious building. I had something with elderflower - whatever that means - delicious! They even have a fire-place. You'll definitely be impressed when you check it out, and so will be your date/friend."}
{"text":"Was looking for a special place to brunch with friends while visiting TO. Read about the place in www.nowtoronto.com. The place was not easy to find for a visitor but was an amazing find! Would go back."}
{"text":"Le lieu est véritablement exceptionnel, (il est un peu difficile à trouver) et la nourriture est remarquable : le poulpe grillée aux herbes était excellent, les coquilles Saint Jacques fraiches parfaitement assaisonnées, et le sticky toffee pudding un vrai délice. Les ingrédients sont frais, et les assortiments originaux et très réussis. Nous recommandons chaudement !"}
{"text":"Gallery Grill had surprisingly small portions. I never say this, but I think that our meals could have benefited from some carbs. Mashed potatoes, frites, rice or spaetzle would have been welcome additions on our plates. 

The food we did have was very well executed and flavourful, but for Sunday brunch, I was expecting a bit more.

Although it's certainly a nice venue, on the day we went, I wouldn't describe Gallery Grill as a \"warm\" brunch atmosphere-- no upbeat music, no big groups, no laughter. This is a perfect place to bring a certain type of person, though. (A visiting professor, a mother-in-law, or a grandfather, for instance.)

Tip: If you need to make Sunday brunch reservations, they can't confirm your reservations on a Friday night since the restaurant isn't open on Saturdays. You'll have to wait for a confirmation email on Sunday morning before 9."}
{"text":"We always have such a pleasant experience here. Beautiful atmosphere, the food is spectacular, delicious. The quality is so much higher than some of the other supposedly fancy restaurants. Attentive and warm service. 
We had the cod rillettes as an appetizer, charred octopus and yucca latkes as entrées and the toasted pound cake for dessert. I will only say the pound cake was slightly burnt which is uncharacteristic of the high end service here. Regardless, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today for lunch and it was phenomenal. I had the salmon and the creme brulee (made from their own maple syrup which they make on Hart House farm). Both incredibly delicious. The menu changes all the time apparently so the menu they have up on the website is only an indication of what's on offer. They do lunches weekdays and brunch on Sundays (& I think cocktails Weds - Fri eves). Beautiful setting - try to get a table overlooking the Great Hall. Service was impeccable and the two people I was with, who have dined there before, said that it always is. Menu is a bit pricey (about $20 for a main) but so worth it!"}
{"text":"The menu is very interesting...I tried the Smoked Trout Okonomiyaki and it was lovely!  The Lemon sorbet is also very on point.  Hart House is full of great things!"}
{"text":"Gallery Grill is a hidden gem at UofT and a lot of people outside the university do not know about this place. It is located inside Hart House, a beautiful historical building that is used to host various events, such as wedding receptions, graduation ceremonies and other social events. It is one of those \"Harry Potter\" buildings of UofT. The decorations inside the restaurant especially around christmas are beautiful. We went for lunch with my colleagues and I noticed that a lot of people were dressed in business-casual attire.
We were seated in a big hall with huge windows and a high ceiling. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and patiently explained the menu to us and answered our questions.
I got the soup of the day (potato-leek) which was extra rich and flavorful. The portion size was just right. For main I got the grilled lamb belly sandwich - another amazing dish. It was not really a sandwich that you are supposed to pick up and bite into: it was a layer of bread topped with juicy lamb belly, home-made mayo, tomatoes, black kale, and finished with fresh arugula on top - a fancy twist on a sandwich. It was absolutely delicious. 
This place is well-known for their maple syrup Creme brulee so I had to order that for dessert even though other choices on the menu sounded pretty good too. It certainly did not disappoint!! You have to break the burnt caramel at the top to get to the rich creamy delicious part at the bottom. I could have gone for a second one except that I was so full I could barely move and was already in a food coma from all the delicious food.
There are not that many options on the menu, but everything is the best quality.
I will definitely be back in the near future, and try their drinks and other dishes. Creme brulee will be on my dessert list again... can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining options in the city and one of the best for Canadiana, if not the best. I am speaking from the perspective ambience, creativity and value. 

Patrons tend to the provincial legislators and officials from nearby businesses/museums and their clients etc. This is truly one of the hidden gems of Toronto's dining scene. Food has a strong farm to table feel to it, and the maple syrup is from their own farm. For deserts, this place is incredible as well. 

Only drawback is they close down in the summer and only open for lunch & brunch. Otherwise you can have a meal as good as many of TO's top dining establishments sans the pretense for all the price of dining at Moxie's. For those looking to host an event, this could be a viable and cost-effective alternative to booking other spaces at the gorgeous Hart House."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  Every time I go I am more and more impressed.  The last time was what made me write this review and give them a 5 star high-five!

The meal:
Spicy Beet Soup
Arctic Char on a bed of beets, pears, salad w/ almonds
Sticky Toffee Banana Pudding
Moroccan Mint Tea

Everything was just delicious.  In fact, I was there the weekend before and should have gotten the arctic char.  I am so glad I came back to get it.  

Things you should know: I totally hate beets.  And this whole meal was FILLED with beets.  Gallery Grill made me like something I hate.  That's a whole star in itself!  

The arctic char was so tender and flaked right off the skin.  You didn't even need to use a knife, it was fork worthy.  I also enjoyed the beets, pears and almonds it was placed upon.  All very fresh.

Usually after 2 courses I'm stuff but the portion sizes are perfect and we had dessert.  I kind of wish I had selected a different dessert item, but do not get me wrong the sticky toffee banana pudding was great.  I was a little thrown off because it wasn't so sweet that my fillings wanted to fall out.  Basically, it was done well but I'm used to BAD, sickeningly sweet sticky toffee pudding.  I left without feeling like throwing up even though I had a 3 course LUNCH.  Another star!

I also appreciate their tea selection.  They have an assortment of teas which makes dessert THAT much more desirable AND possible (aiding in digestion).

I definitely love the Gallery Grill.  The most important thing is that everything they make tastes extremely fresh.  I prefer lunch over brunch, as well."}
{"text":"Situated at UofT, over looking the Great Hall in Hart House, the Gallery Grill is a small place, and a great find!

It seemed like it was only locals in the restaurant. It was full of families, dates and older folk. What I liked about the venue is that it was different. The vaulting ceilings, art on the walls, wooden furniture gave it a really unique feel. 

We came here with my boyfriend and my parents, and it was a great spot to chat, and have an intimate meal. 

The food itself was good, but I can't pin point the thing that bothered me about it.  Maybe it was the menu, and how it seemed to embellish everything when it was simply just a salad or cheesecake. Or maybe it was was the server was a bit condescending to us, and didn't really offer nice suggestions. Or maybe it was because for brunch, there was only 2 breakfassy type items. 
Or it just could be this pre-dispositioned attitude of my parents who like to criticize everything (in other words, the food was really good and they ruined it)

I got the soft poached egg on cod cake with hollandaise (i.e. Eggs Benny). I was a little surprised to see only 1 egg. However, the cod cake was quite filling and delicious, and fresh. The Egg was perfectly poached. And it all sits on top of a salad. It was really healthy, yet indulgent. My only complaint was that it was not hot, but only a luke warm. 

We also ordered the Rabbit Meatballs. It was definitely something different. The rabbit was actually quite soft, and the balls fell apart when you touched it. The sauce was a sweet tasting porcini tomato sauce. 

They did serve us a nice fresh (not toasted) bread with butter. I forgot to order the blueberry biscuits.

For dessert, we shared the creme brulee. It was very good, and perfectly crusted on the top. BUT, although hot on the top, it was COLD on the bottom. I understand they just took it out from the fridge, and browned the top, but the temperature difference was too great. 

I'd come back again. Maybe not with my parents (my mom wasn't impressed because she doesn't like new things, but my dad liked it), but I would really recommend it for new to Toronto relatives on your tour of downtown, or just someone you want to impress."}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: When you enter this restaurant inside the Hart House, you need to look no further to be at Hogwarts. Beautiful building - Gothic architecture with stained glass. The stained glass has paintings of old professors.

Beverage: Unusual - juices like pear +ginger, cocktails, wines.

Food & service: The manger is friendly but the staff - depends on whom you get for service. The waiter we had was rude & blew hot & cold. My husband was trying to be friendly through out the meal but the waiter never thawed. We had taken our son for his birthday & when the waiter was told conversationally that it was his b'day, he just said 'that's nice' & didn't wish him. This is supposed to be a fine dining place & detracted from our meal experience. A 'Happy Birthday' would have vindicated the waiter & got a 5 star. Hence the 4 star. Service is 3 star or less.

The food menu is limited, especially for vegetarians but unique. They did make a dish sans fish which I ordered. Otherwise we would all be eating the gnocchi. However, I feel they should have substituted something in place of fish or offered a discount.

A fine dining place, provided the service is nice. It would be nice to see some more vegetarian entrees."}
{"text":"September is only weeks away and you know what that means! It means that the Hart House restaurant/grill is open again! Hallelujah! The HH restaurant is tucked away inside the U of T campus and only operates from September to June, Monday to Friday. The old school setting of the whole Hart House grounds is just such a pleasure to walk through especially during the beautiful fall months. It is the place that I have most frequented for my birthday celebrations and it meets my Virgo demands! The grill room is stunning with vaulted ceilings and stained glass that doesn't feel dated but rather seems to enhance the history and stateliness of the buildings. 

Don't for a minute think you'll get an old school menu here, that just ain't so. I've had some really interesting and diverse foods at Hart House. One of my most favorite dishes has been a grilled Whitefish with a side salad that was comprised of apple mixed with some shredded wild boar & bacon. It had a big time bite to it and I was surprised at the balance of the tartness of the apple against the game meat. Loved it. My girlfriend had the Frittata (oh you damn vegetarians) and she told me it was delicious, layered with artichokes and Oka cheese. I must say though one of my most favorite things are the goat's cheese biscuits. I'm a sucker for them. I could just eat up a plate of those with a bowl of soup and feel just as happy. 

You'd think that a restaurant in a setting such as U of T would command a solemn, library like tone to it but this doesn't happen. It is airy and really a very comfortable restaurant. No chrome, no glass, no snooty waiters and no restaurant makeovers here. They keep the menu small and seasonal and offering wine pairings for the dishes as well. 

September is just a few weeks in the offing. I'm counting the days. Can't wait to see what is on the menu for my birthday this year! :)"}
{"text":"Tucked away on the second floor of Hart House @ the University of Toronto, it's a pretty hidden gem of a brunch spot. 

This place is only open during the school year and reservations are recommended, as this place doesn't hold that many people as it is hosted in the Gallery of the \"great hall\" of Hart House.

Gallery Grill is the type of place, where you should dress up in your semi-casual finest to meet the parents kind of deal...

The food is fantastic, serving up local fare pared with wines and fresh squeezed juices. My understanding is that their menu changes daily, since the menu we got was the date written on it, so there is that surprise.

I took my boyfriend here for brunch to celebrate his birthday with his university friends. We really didn't have much to complain about, since the food and wine (for those of us who sampled) was great, the service was wonderfully attentive without being obvious.

Overall, it was a wonderfully satisfying meal and setting. I'll come back here if I want to celebrate any significant milestone in my life."}
{"text":"I can't believe the Gallery Grill has so few reviews.  It is a real hidden gem in Toronto.  The surroundings are beautiful and the food is delicious.  The maple creme brulee was easily the best creme brulee I've ever had.  The cheddar biscuits, which are available at brunch, are flaky and moist, but would be much, much better if served warm.  All of the entrees that I've tried have been creative, well seasoned, and well presented.  Most recently I had a lamb and cheese fontina sandwich with tender meat, salty cheese, and a touch of sweetness from honey.  The sandwich, which was toasted on the outside like french toast, was incredibly filling.  The food is definitely worth five stars.

The main drawback is the service.  The last time that I was there, I was given only one tiny glass of water and it was not refilled until a waiter finally walked by and made eye contact with me and I asked for more water.  I also did not find the waiter or the host particularly friendly.  The service is worth about two stars."}
{"text":"Well, well, well...a very stately establishment much in keeping with the university setting.  Lovely wait staff.   Offered good salads for lunch.  Limited wines by the glass."}
{"text":"My friends and I went there for winterlicious lunch. Not my pick, but I went along. It's situated inside Hart House which could be a hidden gem. Unfortunately, I would not be going back at all unless it's free food. 

3 course meal for $23 (plus taxes and tip) was definitely not worth it at all. This small Cat was still hungry after it and yes I could eat another 3 courses!!! 

The portion was small for lunch. The soup was made for a baby. The entree of mushrooms cake slices with a salad looked more like an appetizer and it was deep fried to my surprise. Yes, oily! And the two scoops of pear sorbet could be bought as one scoop at a local gelato place. 

Thank goodness for great service and company. 

Verdict: go back only if someone else is paying for it. At least the food wasn't salty."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch w my team. The device was excellent and the food came out fast. Our water glasses were always kept full and the waitresses would come by and check to make sure everything was okay. The venue is really just beautiful. You feel like royalty in there. Its not a modern, chic, or contemporary decor- its the Hart House so it's a very traditional and upscale kind of feeling. Heavy Wooden tables and chairs. I got the spicy charred savoy salad ($7) small portion but very tasty. It had a kimchi kind of seasoning to it. My entree I had the gnocchi which was alright, not the best but still good. Ended the meal off w a latte which Listeners me in the China bowl. That was a nice touch and very cute, the latte itself was well made. Would def come back for a nice dinner."}
