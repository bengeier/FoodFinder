{"text":"Food is always hot and fresh. I've eaten here for years and have never had a problem with the food or the customer service.   My personal recommendations:  Baked Ziti (SOO good!!)  Pasta Salad Roasted potatoes (THE BOMB!!!)   But..don't take my word for it; check them out for yourself."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had.  The staff told us we were waiting 19 min for breadsticks to cook to go with our meal.  Ok, but it was almost 35 min before I asked about then and they told me another 15 min, then 30 min later I asked and they didn't remember who I was.  So frustrating"}
{"text":"I find the prices to be too high for the quality of the food. It really doesn't taste that great, especially the pizza. There aren't many places I like to eat in the mall so I only come here if I'm hungry enough."}
{"text":"I think Sbarro has good pizza, but everybody knows that it is way too expensive and you can find better pizza at a better price elsewhere. Although sometimes it is convenient for when you are shopping at the mall and can't be bothered to venture elsewhere. And on those occasions I do find that their pepperoni pizza is pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"The is good.  Love the Stromboli's, however my visit today I had to keep asking for a napkin.  Finally I received 1 napkin and I gave up asking for some dipping sauce.  So food was good service was really bad.  I thinking that maybe the cashier just didn't speak English."}
{"text":"Sbarro, what happened? I do not go to a mall more than twice a year but when I do and want something to eat, I always go to Sbarro. This piece of pizza is terrible."}
{"text":"Food is so so.  Service is friendly.  In the mall so good for people watching.  Kinda of on the expensive side"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Just make sure to let them know not to over cook your pizza when they reheat it."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza for a wonderful price! We got two of the New York extra large extreme pepperoni pizzas for just under $30. This Sbarro doesn't have its own eating area (like the one at the Superstition Mall), but the food court where it is located has plenty of seats and was very clean."}
{"text":"I've been to this Sbarro a few times and three things have remained constant... #1: The food has been awesome! Very good pizza for a great price! We got 2 NY large pizzas and a couple of drinks for under $30... #2: The service has been real good. Each of the employees we've dealt with here were very courteous... and #3: This place has been filthy.  Every time we've been here, at least 2 tables were covered in crumbs and drops of pizza sauce. The trash cans were overflowing and the floor needed to be swept.  I love the food here and the employees are polite, but they need to work on keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"This probably one of the worst Sbarro pizza places I have been to. Like other places in this mall they charge for regions, but if you get a large they are free. I was in the area for a week and every day all of their food was over cooked and burnt. While the staff seemed nice, the food was terrible and only needed to go there and pay once for pizza I could leave in an oven to burn and get the same satisfaction."}
{"text":"First of all, Arrowhead Mall's food court is an absolute disgrace if you look at competing options. And maybe that's one of the reasons why I'm not as harsh on Sbarro as a lot of people seem to be.  Everyone hates on Sbarro. And if you're going to compare it to my beloved wood-fired pizza joints, then sure, it's kind of a joke. But Sbarro is merely mall \"food court food\" - and I don't feel standards are very high to begin with.  Realistically, a giant slice of pizza, side of pasta, and drink for eight bucks is really no different than what I'd pay at the drive-thru of most fast food restaurants. Not that I'm saying that their food is anything spectacular, because it isn't. But despite what everyone claims, neither are all of the \"fast casual\" pizza joints that everyone is currently obsessed with.  Or maybe I just have a soft spot for Sbarro-ish pizza places that bring back fond memories of my teenage years of wolfing down greasy pizza and playing arcade games back when malls were more culturally relevant.  Bottom line: It's not that bad. And if I'm going to lash out at a restaurant that fails to deliver in what's promised, I'd rather conserve that energy for a place more deserving of it."}
{"text":"Food court location at Arrowhead mall.  Way overpriced for what they serve.  1 slice, 1 side (very small potatoes), and 1 drink was around $7and that's a meal combo \"deal\".  I know it's the mall, but I can do a lot better for $7.  It was very unappealing to see them carefully weigh the side portion of potatoes - OMG don't accidentally give me one potato chunk too many! loss of profits!!  Service was rather friendly on my visit, and perhaps it was because someone seeming to be in a managerial role was working \"the line\".   Probably everyone has had a slice of sbarro and there's nothing special to write home about.  Side potatoes were a little too oily.  Mall crowd is lame, even though I admit I'm part of the crowd if I'm there.  I'm still miffed about the $7 \"deal\".  I'll go to a local place next time."}
