{"text":"Great ambience, great poutine. Couldn't have asked for more. Nice find in a fun area!"}
{"text":"Before we moved to Montreal, a friend recommended that we try poutine when we arrived. One of the first things we did when we got here was to explore Old Port, so when we passed Montreal Poutine, we decided to give it a try. We sat at a table on the patio by the street so that we could still enjoy Rue St. Paul and Old Montreal while we ate. We asked our waiter what he recommended and he suggested smoked meat poutine and sangria. We weren't disappointed. We have taken all of the people who visit us to eat here. They love the food and they love the area. My only complaint is that the tables are always just a little sticky. A bit of a turn off, but the food and drinks make up for it."}
{"text":"The poutine here was excellent! I would recommend the pulled pork & chicken. Definitely will be coming back, the service was great as well."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat dinner at 2am in Montreal is no small feat.  There are many bars open but it is hard to find something to eat, unless you come to Montreal Poutine, which delivered beyond our expectations.  The outdoor sit down area in the back is very romantic - garden style, candlelit, heat lamps, you get the idea.  The staff is very friendly and nice.  We had the burger with the poutine fries and we were pleasantly surprised!  It was almost like a delicacy -- sirloin and cooked perfectly, red in the middle. The salad greens that came with it were amazing, fresh and tasty.  Also had the \"best beer in the world\" as stated by our waiter - the Blanch de Chambly - which is a Quebecois beer which is oh so good; refreshing, light, citrusy.  Almost like a Blue Moon but not as thick.   Would definitely come back here for another burger."}
{"text":"We were on a poutine tasting tour on 4/19/2015. Part one.  We shared a poutine with smoked meat and cheese curds. We each got a beer sleekman silver and sleekman rousse. The poutine was large in portion size so sharing was a good idea. The smoked meat was similar to pastrami in flavor but roast beef in texture. We asked for more gravy because only the top part of the poutine had gravy. The first server said ok to the gravy but never brought it to us. The second server said it was a dollar more, we agreed, and she brought it out right away. We sat outside and was entertained by the birds and a fellow customer's baby."}
{"text":"While a nice little place with tasty food, the service was not as great. A young guy, who seemed to be a buser was more attentive with our table than our actual server. She did not check on us once! Before I could pull out separate cash (paid debit) to tip, she asked if we were going to leave a tip for her. Experience was fine until that happened, but ruined after that."}
{"text":"I love poutine. Being in Montreal I expect the poutine to be on point. I ordered a classic poutine. Just cheese curds and gravy. It  was just alright. It didn't blow me away or make me want seconds.   I love the experience of being in Old Montreal and enjoying the cobblestone road with the old buildings. It was a chilly day and my waitress was more than accommodating when my friends and I wanted to switch tables and sit in the sunshine. She checked on us frequently and was super polite to us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were walking by and saw the sign for poutine, and thought \"we have to try this place\". Being poutine lovers, we weren't disappointed. We went for the classic and it was a pretty fair size. I left full, but I'm sure my boyfriend could have eaten a little bit more, since we split it ;) I loved that we could sit out in the back garden in the middle of November because of the heat lamps. It really reminded us of Mud (coffee) in NYC. We even went back later at night for my boyfriend to get a burger and another poutine."}
{"text":"Awesome poutine! The chicken poutine was delicious.  We sat out on their adorable patio.  Service was quick and efficient.  A full bar would make it a 5 star place!"}
{"text":"Smoked meat poutine and draft beer on the patio. So nice we went back twice. I've had meltier cheese, faster service and a little less gristly meat on my poutine, but atmosphere and friendly staff make up for all. Sit in the stone courtyard!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I bough my poutine to go, then changed our mind and ask if we could sit, and also offered to pay the difference for the \"sit down menu\" but the rude waitress said that it wasn't possible and \"that's why I asked your first, now you can't just change your mind\" Nevermind the tables were completely empty! Never seen someone so narrow minded, especially towards a customer for  a such a small request. Just for a such a terrible service I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Tourist trap, they don't serve tap water, instead you must pay $3 for bottled water.  Also, they jam pack the restaurant and make you wait for an hour for food.   Avoid!!"}
{"text":"Had a quick stop in the Old Port and wanted to get my usual Montreal fix of poutine and a smoked meat sandwich.   Both were good, its no Schwartz', but cured my itch.  Don't get stuck on the back patio though, its dark out there."}
{"text":"Very quick service food was also quick and tasty.. Would recommend for a lunch or treat .. Only one down fall was no wine .."}
{"text":"Quiet dissapointed with the taste. Nothing extraordinary. Infact we have to throw out 3/4 of poutine and went to Chinatown area.  The ambiance was good but will never be coming back, i thought Montreal is the place to be for poutine but McDonalds poutine is way much better."}
{"text":"The Montreal Smoked Meat Poutine was very good! I tried the Italian sausage from my friends plate, it wasn't the greatest, it would have been better If the sausage was grilled. The bacon I also tried and it was obviously good because everything tastes good with bacon!"}
{"text":"Was I ever impressed with how good the poutine was?! I've had good poutine, but this was incredible! Plus the portions were very reasonable, as was the price."}
{"text":"Even if it's written Montreal Poutine you should stay away from this establishment if you want an authentic poutine. The quality of the food and service was very disappointing for the price. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Petit resto trouvé au coin de la rue Saint Paul. Près du vieux port. Accueil agréable mais tous les québécois sont agréable quand on est français. Et en qui concerne les poutine... Délicieux!!! Excellent!!! Je recommande et le prix est Correk! 12$Cnd le plat"}
{"text":"Très bon ambiance de jardin. Il y a même deux étages. Les Poutine sont délicieux, j'adore Poutine avec saucisse, la salade est mélangé des légumes variés, la sauce marche bien avec!"}
{"text":"Good selection of poutine.  We just discovered the whole concept of poutine the day before in Tremblant at Smokes Poutine, which is an amazing place might I add.  Very casual on one side at least.  Gravy is not the best but still very tasty.  Quick service for a small group.  Floor was messy but nothing horrible.  To be expected in winter to a certain degree."}
{"text":"I found this little place in Old Montreal while walking around. As I was looking at their tempting menu which was pasted outside the restaurant, the kind doorman invited us inside.  The restaurant seemed somewhat like a cafeteria- the décor consisted of plants and t-shirts that were hung around the place reading \"I love Montreal\" or \"I love poutine\". The tables and chairs were made out of steal and the chairs were uncomfortable. Montreal poutine had a backyard outdoor patio as well which many people preferred sitting in. The staff was super friendly but the service was extremely slow and non-existent. It took forever for our waiter to take my order, the food took a while to arrive, and after the food arrived, the waiter disappeared. I had to wait at least 25min for the waiter to be in sight again in order to ask for the bill.   Putting that behind, the food at Montreal poutine was really good and I'm craving it everyday! The menu consisted of a variety of poutine, salads, pizza etc. Oh, the \"I love poutine\" t-shirt was also on the menu. I tried the smoked meat poutine and their chicken caesar salad. The portions were generous, and the food was fresh and delicious! The poutine consisted of perfectly done thick fries, drowned in gravy with a good amount of cheese curds, topped off with tender pieces of smoked meat. My chicken caesar was big, yummy and fresh too. The salad consisted of mozzarella cheese and shredded chicken on greens with strips of crispy bacon- this is perhaps the best chicken caesar I've ever had! The prices were inexpensive too which was awesome.   Overall, Montreal Poutine restaurant has great food and prices, but do expect horrifying service and ugly décor."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst place to go. Like others have said, if I could give zero stars I would. Our waiter was the most inattentive I have ever had. We waited about 23 minutes after we sat down before he even came to ask for our drinks. By then we were ready to order so we ordered our food with our drinks. We waited another hour before we got our food. Mind you, the only time we've seen our waiter was when he got our order and there were lots of empty tables. Our drinks never came. Luckily there were two waitresses that were able to help us so we were able to cancel our drinks and get our check. Instead of our original waiter coming out to bring our check, he cowardly sent it with one of the waitresses. Never got our drinks and never got an apology. We saw other tables that had him as a waiter complain about him as well. The food wasn't even that great and a little over priced. So disappointed. Definitely go to Poutineville instead... They're awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food in the center of old town! They have nice sitting area when you can sip beer and enjoy a hot day.  Great service! Francis is fantastic servant who really helped us finding the place to stay for the night and recommended where to go.  I definitely am coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place for some smoked meat and poutine. I do not have complaints on the quality of food. However the portion is considerably small for the price. The smoked meat platter consists of a tiny sandwich some salad one piece of pickle and a small portion of fries for over 20$. This is really not a platter and I would advise people to avoid it. I was disappointed by the platter as it is not enough to fill one person let alone be shared."}
{"text":"This restaurant is centrally located in a touristy area.  The entry way can be a bit deceiving looking like you are entering a castle or haunted attraction.  Once past the entry way you can dine al fresco and enjoy a wonderful plate of poutine.  The poutine is delicious and set my poutine bar very high.  The cheese curds had the perfect squeak in each bite and the gravy is very flavorful.  I ordered the regular poutine and was licking the plate clean.  I would definitely stop in again and recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Exceptional service!!!! Great food in perfect portion size.   Very fast!!! Very cozy even if busy spot.  Would definitely recommend it to everyone visiting."}
{"text":"Went yesterday night with my friends and we all ordered the smoked meat poutine. I just want to say, garbage! Not enough sauce, potato was cold and not fresh, smoked meat was cold and seems like burned. The gravy covered the taste of the disgusting smoked meat. All I want to say that it was the worst poutine we ever tasted. We will never go there again...."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here. The truth is we were kind of hungry and sat down at the first poutine place we saw.   The open space after you enter is lovely, it almost makes you expect more from them. We had the italian sausage poutine and the smoked meat platter. Both were really good and the food came out really fast which was great. But when asked for a small modification/addition for one of our fries they said it wasn't possible. So there's not much flexibility there.   Another thing is that the whole time we were eating we had to fight of a bunch of very persistent bees. And it wasn't just us, there were multiple tables who moved around a bunch of times. Luckily we aren't allergic or particularly scared that after they cleared out table we were able to enjoy ourselves w/o the bees."}
{"text":"Went here to try poutine. Since I'm a vegetarian I didn't have too many options. I tried the fried onion poutine. It tasted not that good and plus the staff seemed to be really careless. I wouldn't really recommend anyone to go here."}
{"text":"First time to try Poutine and while it was ok definitely had better in other places later on during my trip. We had a super friendly server and loved the back yard location - really interesting stuff to admire on the walls, they have definitely upgraded their backyard since the photos were taken.   Yes, the establishment is on the tourist trail and would not be highly rated compared to the huge amount of fine establishments in Montreal.   Save yourself ordering the coffee. I think the instant fares better. Stick with the beers.  In fairness, we didn't get to try other items on the menu. Would I go back? Yes, if I was in that area again and needed a snack."}
{"text":"I think we may have caught this place on a bad night but I stand by my two stars. The only reason it didn't get one was because the poutine had the potential of being good... but it was cold, hence the poor review. I think our food was mistakenly taken to two other tables before making its way to us.  Service was quite slow, orders were being confused left right and centre, and to boot the bathroom was stuck right in the middle of the dining area. Not very appealing."}
{"text":"First time having poutine- got the standard with fried onions. My friend got a cured meat sandwich-- both were delicious, but what really had me excited here was the friendly service and awesome beer. Fin du monde was perfect and the energy of the outdoor seating area is delightful. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"This was our first poutine experience so we don't have much of a baseline.  However, the poutine itself was very soggy and salty. Maybe that's how it is typically flavored and prepared?  Service was prompt and friendly. We were seated right away, though almost on top of another table which felt a bit awkward, but it wasn't a major deal.  No tap water to offer, only high priced bottled water options.   The outdoor area had a nice, casual, and hip ambiance."}
{"text":"LOVE IT. Simple. Great food. Excellent service. We came here on our honeymoon and it was Amazing."}
{"text":"This place recently changed their policy and now won't even offer water when you buy a meal.  Taking advantage of tourists just because you're located in the old port is not okay!  As a Montreal local, I know that you can get way better Poutine and Crepes, without getting taken advantage of.  AVOID!!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in old port....Delicious poutine...friendly staff and fast service...highly recommended"}
{"text":"I went there to eat on a budget & I went up, from the stained paper menus the unclean tables and very run down look, I should have just turned right around. The place looked like it was falling apart, you could see the unfinished work, and no music, went up stairs and sat around till i saw a waitress. Took a while then I get my food, eat it the rest of it was drowned in sauce, well to my good fortune I went home with food poisoning and spent my night sick."}
{"text":"One of the few things Montreal is known for is poutine, essentially, gravy and cheese curds dumped onto a plate of fries.  What better place than after a long walk sightseeing than to stop by a place called Montreal Poutine.  Located in old Montreal, this divy joint sits on the corner of a busy touristy street.   We grabbed a table outside and people watched as we enjoyed our food.  I added onions and mushrooms to my poutine while my fiancée chose to have Canadian smoked sausage with hers.  Both of our poutines were good but I have a feeling that it's nowhere near the best the city has to offer.  Still we enjoyed it with her hot tea and my ice cold beer.  The service was friendly but wasn't quick.  Seemed like common practice in Montreal but what do you expect with two New Yorkers that wanted everything a minute ago.  The restrooms were down the block, sounds weird but not inconvenient once you're there.  One thing both of us couldn't figure out is how the waitress had on a skimpy dress while we were sitting with jackets on."}
{"text":"Food was served with a broken plate. The waiter was informed of the issue when it was revealed, but simply said \"we will throw the plate out\" without doing anything to compensate. What kind of restaurant serves food on a broken plate and lacks any care for the safety of its customers?"}
{"text":"Worst Poutine i've had  in a long time.  If you are a poutine noob, don't go there.  1st, it is a tourist trap.  2nd, they are using the wrong kind of cheese.  Go to La Banquise.  Do yourself a favor"}
{"text":"Service took forever. And there were ants in my sangria. ANTS. IN MY DRINK. Waiter brought me the wrong food (I ordered pizza instead of poutine) & ran after throwing the plates on the table; took 10 minutes for us to flag him again, and tell him that I did not in fact want the poutine; \"you didn't??\" Took 30 minutes to get the food I ordered after that. Pizza tasted kinda funny but I ate it anyways. Big mistake, my stomach totally hurts now :( After all that, it took well over 20 minutes to get the check, and we were still charged for the sangria. And we got barely any apologies for the terrible service and ANTS IN MY DRINK. Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"We ordered a Classic Poutine and a Beef Sandwich, both of which were good (the former a bit better). For the food, this place would be 4 stars but what I did not appreciate, was the server.   At first she gave me a water with ice, even though I had asked for it without. I decided it was not a big deal. Then, my boyfriend asked for some more water and she did not show up with it for another 10mins. Later, we were sitting and chatting when she abruptly gave us the bill without asking if we were ready for it. We thought maybe there were people waiting to be seated but we looked around to see that the place had a lot of space. It felt awkward but we were done anyway so we did not say anything. All of that aside, I would not have written a negative review but here is where I had the biggest issue - my boyfriend had paid but he didn't notice that the tips were not included in the bill. On seeing this, the waitress pointed out that the tip was not included. He (having not known this) apologised and checked this wallet to see that he did not have a denomination small enough and mentioned this to her. She replied by saying he should run his card again and because of the displeasure clearly showing on both her tone and face, I said I would tip double what I was going to (so 30%).   This is not how waitstaff should behave. It is not pleasant to mention it but even then, just once would have been enough for us to figure out the tips issue."}
{"text":"The food was cold, dirty tables, it was so cold that everyone kept their coats on. Fries are good When it comes to Price versus quality and quantity don't eat here, just because it's in old Montreal does not equal good."}
{"text":"What can I say.. Had an all around bad experience. It seemed as though everyone was new, or inexperienced in the service industry. We were told to grab a seat anywhere and nobody came over for 20 minutes. We finally flagged someone over and we told her how long we had waited. She took our order and we didn't see her again for another 15minutes. In the meantime other tables are being sat and served their food before anything came to our table. We expressed our concerned to 2 other servers and they didn't seem to care. Finally the drinks arrived and she said \"sorry, it takes a long time.\" Our poutines finally arrived 45 minutes after arriving and the one order was wrong. She apologized and brought me the correct order. It was cold and at that point I didn't want to complain anymore. Sorry guys, awful experience."}
{"text":"The poutine was very good and generous portion. However, the service was terribly slow and it wasn't that busy in the restaurant. I had stopped by here for a 'quick' lunch while in town for work. I was eating solo and unfortunately, the servers kept ignoring my table. They kept looking at my table, just didn't bother to come by. Once I was served, the food still took almost 30 mins. I am not sure if they were short on staff or what the problem was. Regardless, the long waits made eating alone even more awkward. I would never go back because of the service."}
{"text":"Despite the reviews, we found ourselves trying this place. We were disappointed that the food was not hot, a can of soda cost $3.50 and the tables were sticky.  The courtyard has a nice feel bit that was it.  Would recommend for a drink only."}
{"text":"I bought the onion and mushroom poutine and a Montreal smoke meat sandwich.  The sandwich was very good.  The meat was warm and so moist.  Very good.   The poutine was ok, I wish I bought something with bacon or something also meaty to enhance the flavour.  I did like the onion and mushroom though, but just thinking about the possibilities.  The weird thing is, maybe because I was in a hurry, I under tipped.  The waiter asked me if there was something wrong with the service but honestly there was nothing wrong with it but nothing exceptional either.  I happened to go early on a Saturday morning, right when the store opened.  So after I told him nothing was wrong, he informed me that in Montreal the tipping is 15%.  So he asked me for $1.50 more.  I felt embarassed because I wasn't paying attention and I just wanted to give him a flat $30 after eating $26 something. Maybe I am cheap.  Before entering, my brother and I wanted to see how much their poutine was, and already they were shouting at us that it was not opened yet.  So the food was good, but I'm not sure about the service.  I still gave it a chance after being shooed away."}
{"text":"Very simple place but a great view of the street in Old Montreal. Friendly and unique atmosphere and the Poutine was good, not the best we had but good!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, walked in, the guy told us to pick where we wanted to sit, we sat down near the window, weren't handed menus or asked for drinks or anything, waited 5 minutes and nothing, 2 people walked in way after us got seated and menus, SMH."}
{"text":"Looks like a tourist trap but excellent poutine!  Friendly people. They pack you on there but it's worth it. Fries, cheese, gravy and miraculous smoked meat (corned beef?)"}
{"text":"Rude waitress, asked for how much i was going to tip before she gave me the change back! Very drafty and expensive drinks! Still Poutine was good and the size was ok."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a name like this and you are looking to cross something off your culinary to-do list.  Neat outside seating (small courtyard) and a simple menu.  In a touristy area but not their fault...there is nothing but restaurant after restaurant on the same street so they are not alone.  Take in the beautiful surrounding area and stop in for a serving of their namesake.  I was pleased with the smoked meat added to my dish."}
{"text":"It's certainly not the best poutine in Montreal, but it's right there in old Montreal and offers up a cool outdoor eating area.   For those brave souls who don't mind a Quebec winter, they've even set up heaters on the perimeter walls of the terrace, which makes it comfortable enough to enjoy your meal without freezing.  This definitely IS NOT the place to lose your poutine virginity, but it's decent enough in my books as a place to get your fix when you're craving gravy, curds and fries. Which is always. So enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just ate here.  Best poutine ever.  Amazing flavour.  They even use vegetarian gravy!  Highly recommended if you're looking for any kind of poutine including vegetarian."}
{"text":"I came to Montreal on a business trip and I was told I had to try Poutine. While I was out walking in Old Montreal I stumbled upon the restaurant Montreal Poutine. I figured, \"why not,\" and I'm glad I did! I have now become addicted to Poutine thanks to this amazing place! If you are in Old Montreal, stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here with a colleague on a cold, snowy January evening because most of the restaurants in this street were closed. As soon as we walked upstairs, for a moment we thought this place was closed too, it was completely empty and most of the lights were dimmed.  A guy who was busy conversing with another guy told us we could sit where we wanted so we picked a table near the window.  The service was really lacking the basics , we felt like they did not want to make any effort. The same guy took our orders but did not try to make any conversation and looked bored.  We had the classic poutine and the smoked meat poutine, which were good.  During the entire time we were there, the person who served us remained near the kitchen and continued his conversation with his coworker, pretty much ignoring us even though we were the only customers inside. We had to pay cash because of some issues with their system. The one star is for the food."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!  My wife had the Montréal Smoked Meat Poutine and I had the Italian Sausage Poutine - both were amazing variants of the traditional Poutine.  This is definitely a must for those who enjoy a \"real\" Poutine experience."}
{"text":"Worst poutine I've ever had. Expensive considering the portions and there was no heating in the winter - just a small portable heater. There was not much space and you have to go up the stairs into a small, dirty area."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative 5 star, I would.  Was very hungry and went to this place against my better judgement/instinct.  It is definitely a tourist trap.  First of all, they would not offer tap water in a glass (only bottled water).  There was only one kind/size of poutine and arrived at the table warm (instead of hot).  The smoked meat sandwich was on something one step above Wonder Bread.  The woman who served us was grumpy the entire time.  We left a 10% tip and she had the audacity to ask for more.  And when we left, there was a giant bucket and towels at the entrance to catch some yellowish water leaking from the ceiling.  We are bilingual and have made multiple trips to Montreal and this is the WORST meal ever!"}
{"text":"Great service. The regular poutine was pretty great. I enjoyed just sitting outside in the nice surprisingly mild Montreal weather sipping on white wine and sharing the poutine with my husband who had never had it before."}
{"text":"Wanted to try poutine for the first time so decided to pick a place that has good reviews but also close by to where we were at Rue Saint Paul.  I would give this 3.5 stars if I there is a \"half star\" to give.  First of all, it was very busy when we visited.  It was during the Labor Day weekend so think \"a lot of tourists\".  The host that greeted us was very friendly and chatty.  The service was fast, from ordering food to getting our food.  Now on to the food.  I ordered the Classic Poutine and my husband ordered the smoked meat sandwich.  The poutine that I was served with tasted like fries with gravy, basically not that impressive.  The smoked meat sandwich was actually pretty tasty.  I enjoyed the smoked meat sandwich more than I enjoyed my poutine.  Whenever I am not impressed with a dish that I tried the first time I don't discount the dish and believe it's due to how it was made.  So I docked some stars for this place because the poutine did not blow me away.  Other than that, the place is pretty casual and fun and has a good vibe.  Food-wise, maybe not come here for poutine?  Or I was just unlucky that day..."}
{"text":"I took my aunt & mom - we've no problem with portion size or the room/terrace.  Service leaves much to be desired. After ordering and waiting 25 minutes and seeing 4 other tables that came after us be served. I caught the server's attention (wasn't easy). I told him that many who came after us have already been served & asked when our order was coming. He barked at me that it was because I ordered a pizza. I corrected him and repeated our entire order.  He returned 10-15 minutes later with the entire order explaning another server took his plates. He did not apologize.  I've never seen such a tiny hot dog - before this Hot Dog trio I thought the size was standard. The Ceasar salad was sopping wet - there was 1/2 cup of liquid at the bottom of the plate.  You are paying for the location - much better can be had at better prices.  I mourn the loss of the now defunct Bishop St. location - service, portions & quality of the food served was far superior.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Super touristy spot but for what it is, it's pretty OK. Not a great value, but when I compare it to other tourist traps I've gotten stuck at, it's fine. Wife had the salad with goat cheese which was really the best dish. Kids had super thin pizza which they enjoyed. I had the poutine which didn't grab me though I've never had it before, but the \"smoked meat\" wasn't smoky or salty. The cheese curds were very mild. The gravy was mild. The fries were mild. I kinda don't get it.  Nice beer selection. Someone ordered a burger which turned out well. $100 for 5 lunches and 3 20oz drafts."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic huge salad along with the onion poutine and an apple beer/cider - everything was great. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Like many folks, we decided to stop in for a chance to warm up and eating some hearty poutine and grab a cocktail.  We ended up splitting an order of the smoked meat poutine and a couple of hotdogs.  We also made the horrible mistake of ordering a Long Island ice tea.  What?! Don't judge me.  They said they couldn't make an Old Fashioned because they were out of one of the ingredients.  Poutine was average.  The gravy and cheese were okay but the smoked meat was strange.  It was just all mushy and slapped on and kind of tasted like bologna.  The Long Island was a joke.  It's was just all soda/pop/Coke.  I've never seen a long island drink that was pretty much all black.  Bleh. Surprisingly enough though, the hot dogs were pretty good.  Very simple and ball park-like. Skip the smoked meat poutine and try another variety."}
{"text":"We stopped there to try local poutine and it had a great patio. we ordered poutine with pulled pork and it was very tasty. One of the best places we went in Montreal. Nice atmosphere, good cup of cappuccino...it felt like I was back in Europe...nostalgia...."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to eat a good poutine this is the place For 10$ you get a fully loaded poutine with LOTS of cheese, gravy and topping. And best of all they have deep fried avocado...what a great discovery"}
{"text":"I have to day that this place does have the best poutine in town. I ordered the smoked meat poutine, no regrets there, delicious. We came here on a Sunday afternoon, sat outside, ordered some poutine and a few drinks. The prices are not bad, the beer is good, the staff is really friendly. If you're in Montreal and looking to have some poutine, this is the one, I don't know about other franchises but this one on Old Montreal is really nice and the poutine is just delicious."}
{"text":"Family roadtrippin' ain't easy... especially when you're looking to feed 21 people... including 7 small kids. And since we were in Montreal, poutine was a must for the non-Canadians in the family.  Montreal Poutine is located in Old Montreal, full of tourist traps and this was no different. But that's cool... we were tourists. The staff was very accommodating and we were quickly seated at the back patio on a nice Saturday evening. The space had a nice atmosphere for a quick bite and a few drinks.  While the rest of the family got their various poutine, salad, sandwich and kid's pizza orders, I stuck to the regular smoked meat poutine. The plate of poutine was pretty big and filling. It was pretty good, but it didn't seem anything different from poutine in TO, except for the smoked meat topping (but Schwartz smoked meat is waaay better).  Montreal Poutine is a good intro to poutine virgins.  3.5 Stars  Note: they charge for bottled water and don't serve tap water"}
{"text":"So my husband and I were really hungry when we saw this place. Trying poutine was on our to-do list. We ordered smoked meat poutine deal but apparently we didn't communicate clearly enough or our words didn't make sense because what we got was a smoked meat sandwich and really really REALLY greasy fries. It was in a to-go container, which meant we didn't even realize our dish was something else until we were a block away sitting on a bench. We chose to-go because were told it'd be cheaper and faster. Plus the place didn't look too clean. Needless to say we ate some some of the food, but can't really say how the poutine was because it wasn't poutine! The bread part of the sandwich wasn't tasty but at least the seagull we gave it to enjoyed it so that's nice."}
{"text":"This establishment is grimy in the best way possible. Like the kind of grimy where you walk in and realize more focus probably goes into the food than the paint on the walls.   Following a recommendation, we had the must-eat smoked meat sandwich and poutine. This was the first time I ever had a smoked meat (beef in this case) sandwich and I must say, it was AMAZING. Very simple assembly- lots and lots of meat between two slices of bread and a swipe of mustard. We ordered the \"upgraded\" plate so it came with coleslaw, a pickle, and poutine. The poutine was also quite good.   Definitely a touristy, oft-recommended restaurant, but worth it."}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. We came in on a snowy day in March, and the place was warm, the beer was cold, and the service was quick, attentive, and friendly.  I had the meat platter with poutine, and my wife had a burger and fries. Fries were pretty good, meat platter was more of a small beef sandwich, and the poutine was delicious. Overall we were both happy with our experience here. To get more stars, it would have to be a little better in several areas - better beer selection/bar, slightly bigger sandwich, and possibly a little bit wider selection on the menu (in my opinion). Overall, though I wouldn't go back just to go here, if we were passing by I wouldn't mind swinging in again."}
{"text":"I had friends over from out of town and they wanted to stop by and eat something typical. The location is great, right in the center of the old port of Montreal. When we first got in they placed us under a removable roof. It was raining quite a lot and water was pouring down on us and our food and beer.   The staff didn't even care, and we had to take the initiative to grab our food and move to the interior of the restaurant. I must note that the place was empty, so there was no reason to move us all the way to the back. The poutine was delicious and even though they only had one brand of beer (and most variations of it wasn't available), it was also good.   The price was reasonable for the location but the service was very amateurish. Servers concentrated in a single spot and was chatting all night, and laughing and neglecting the very few clients they had. We left a reasonable tip (because we felt like doing so) and the waitress didn't even care to say thank you. My two cents : there are better places to eat in the area for the same price range if you are visiting the old port of Montreal."}
{"text":"While walking through Old Montreal, we stopped here for lunch.    After sitting down in what appeared to be a very casual setting, we saw the menus which the prices seemed somewhat high on.    Regardless, we ordered smoked meats sandwiches and poutine.    The poutine was quite good, but the smoked meat was dry and the sandwich very small. It was really lacking and in no way a comparison to a place like Schwartz's.  They do serve a few different beers, contrary to Monnie's review (it may be something new).    I would by pass this place.  There are much better places to eat in Old Montreal for about the same price."}
{"text":"So now there's a location downtown on Bishop street! When I'd heard that I thought my colleague was hallucinating. Happily though, he was on the money and a day later we were settling in for a great huge helping of  delicious Poutine topped with smoked meat. The presentation - in a proper plate - was a nice surprise as my previous experience at a different store was more like stuffing 18 undergrads into a phone booth. But that wasn't the best part of the meal. Seriously, anyone can manage to stock a restaurant with china plates. The best part was the crunchy-on-the-outside fries bathed in a none-too-salty sauce, then topped with squeaky-cheese and smoked meat. There's really not much else one can ask of a restaurant, is there? Quality ingredients, skilled preparation and attractive presentation were all showcased here. Now if only the hordes would leave some avocado fries for me."}
{"text":"It gets two stars for the lovely garden seating but that is all that is worth any stars. Service was awful. Prices exorbitant-$11 for a smoked meat sandwich with no sides. Poutine was mediocre-hello?! It's IS your namesake! it should be exceptional. There are too many great options for dining in the area, skip this place."}
{"text":"Went here with a local When in town had a chicken sandwich with poutine. The sandwich was a chunk of chicken the was to small for the bread the poutine was ok. Big tourist trap"}
{"text":"Pretty average for poutine.  Loved the courtyard atmosphere but service was spotty and unattentive."}
{"text":"Tourist trappy place (as you'd expect) in Old Port.  We had three kinds of poutine (Italian sausage, mushroom onion, shredded pork) and a smoked sandwich with fries  Poutine was okay; nothing special.  Ditto the smoked meat. The fries with the smoked meat sandwich were cold (maybe they are always able to upsell to poutine and that heats them up?)  We were initially seated at a table adjacent to the bathroom. The bathroom is nasty. Really nasty, and the smell wafts into the small dining area when the door is opened. Not good for the old appetite; know what I'm sayin?  Bright side: the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Great place to get poutine! Definitely geared toward the tourists but it's the best I've found. Choice of a variety of meats including smoked meat, bacon, chicken, and pulled pork (you can get it without meat as well). I've had the smoked meat and the pulled pork and both were really good but I'd go traditional with the smoked meat. Huge (dare I say American) portions. Really tasty, just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"So my wife and I decided to go on a date tonight and we been passing Montreal Poutine many times. Unfortunately, I wish we had kept walking but we didn't and went in. Right from the get go, the two girls who were the hostesses, were unprofessional and appeared to not know what they're doing. After we had ordered, they brought our drinks and one of the glasses began to leak all over the table. The young woman who was cleaning tables actually walked by my table and looked at it and walked away. Other guests sitting beside us were offering their napkins to help clean up or stop the spill. Only when we complained, did they come and clean up the mess. My wife ordered a spicy sausage poutine and it was horrible. The gravy tasted like it was store-bought; the gravy and the fries were nothing to write home about. I had the grilled chicken burger and I can make better ones at home on my own grill and for the price, it was found wanting. The same girl who wouldn't clean the table also came and grabbed my plate as I was finishing the last bite and didn't even ask if I was finished, just pulled it away. We had to wait almost 15 minutes for our waiter to come back to give us the bill even when our plates were gone. He wasn't happy when I was looking for a number amount for the tip instead of a percentage. There is no way that I would ever go back there and it was very poor that they call themselves Montreal poutine. Nothing of the sort. #Notworthspendingyourmoneythere."}
{"text":"When we got here they did not have any tables on the first level so they said we can go to the second floor. We sat there for 30 minutes and finally after multiple times going down and asking for service, someone came to take our order so as you can imagine at first we were very disappointed and about to leave. But the waiter that was sent to take our orders was super nice and made our dining here a great experience. We got almost everything on the menu and they all tasted very good. Sangria was very good too."}
{"text":"After overhyping poutine to my boo for the longest time, I was disappointed by what we started to encounter on our trip to montreal.  Every single place seems to just dump cheese curds and pours gravy on top without any of it melting.  MP was no exception.   The poutine was okay and the service was okay.    I could have sworn that in the past I've eaten poutine from a food truck and the gravy was so piping hot that the curds melted.   Oh well, maybe it was just my memories, but in the old montreal, there didn't seem to be too many dedicated poutineries to choose from."}
{"text":"The poutine was underwhelming and too salty. The restaurant is located in a great spot (near Jack Cartier square) and it has a nice ambiance inside, but the servers were not super friendly. Overall it was just okay."}
{"text":"Incredible patio, but other than that, nothing to write home about. Tried poutine for the first time here. Maybe we're just not that into it, but it was ok. The flavors went surprisingly well together but we couldn't finish one order of it together. If fries and cheese curds covered in gravy sounds like your type of thing, you'll probably enjoy it. The service was very slow. We'd finished our meal and sat there for at least a half hour before we could flag someone down to ask for the check."}
{"text":"The poutine was good, but they only serve bottled water and soft drinks (how a restaurant can get away with not serving tap water seems criminal!) which essentially forces another 3-5 bucks out of you. Service was ok. I've had a better poutine and overall experience at other places in Montreal. Serving tap water alone would have increased my review... I refuse to buy bottled water wen there is perfectly good tap water at a fraction the environmental impact."}
{"text":"Staff are courteous and pleasant. I had the fried chicken poutine and it was delicious, but a bit light on the sauce. The fries at the bottom of the plate were dry. Ask for extra sauce."}
{"text":"It was my last day in Montreal and I still hadn't tried the poutine (for shame!). This place opens early and while it looks crappy from the outside its nice in the terrace. The guys outside are just lovely and sat me right away. Waitress was nice as well. Ordered the regular poutine and some sangria and they were both exactly what I wanted.   My only complaint is that they don't have tab water which seems a bit off."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on Canada Day, they could only accommodate our party on the second floor. It was a hot day and the air conditioning was having a bit of a struggle keeping up.  We all had various flavors of poutine which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Tried my first poutine! Exactly what it says fries, gravy and bland little cheese balls. I think the rendition was good but the sentimental taste is better than it actually is.  Burger was average but on a nice roll. Street watching priceless!"}
{"text":"Not the worst by far from the best. If your name has the main dish in it you better stand out from everyone else including Mc Donald's pushing the same thing, especially if you're gonna overcharge.  Not consistent enough for me to go back a fourth time. Sorry guys find some other sucker to pay your rent. If my fellow yelpers must go here to get ur poutin fix keep it simple, and whatever you do stay away from the braised beef!!! I don't know what that animal was, but it wasn't no cow!"}
{"text":"4 Stars for being a most enjoyable tourist eatery in the middle of Old Montreal.  Montreal poutine earns it's 4 stars by surpassing our (lowered) expectations. We were looking for a place to relax, where we can unwind with a snack and talk over a couple of pints, a place to bide our time in Old Montreal while we wait for our reservations at a fancy restaurant. Pickings were slim since we didn't want a full meal and other places just didn't have a very exciting selection of beers. We took a leap of faith and decided to venture into this terrasse hidden among souvenir shops.  Service was OK. Not exceptional not awful but OK. We wanted beer and we wanted a snack and they brought these things to us and we were happy.   They have a more diverse selection of beers on tap (about 8 to be precise) than other places we passed along. We had the Fin du Monde (9%) and a Blanche de Chambly  (5%) in 20oz pints for a mere $8.04 each. We wanted a cheaper lighter meal so we shared lovely crisp French fries with sauce (like the one they drench poutines in) for $5.   And of course there's a moderate selection of  poutines($11-$12). I'm sure their poutines are adequate (their fries are very good) but I would make a point to also try poutine from more storied establishments like La Banquise.   The terrasse is gorgeous. We had a memorable experience sipping our drinks in the open air enveloped on all sides by old stone walls with a giant E.T. looking down on us over the entrance. It felt great to take our time after a day rushing from one point of interest to another, and to spend it in this beautiful courtyard. The ambiance will  The bathroom is on the second floor inside the building. On your way to it look out the windows overlooking the terrasse and enjoy the view of your companion(s) stealing your fries.   Don't expect a culinary revelation or impeccable service and come here on a sunny day. Take it easy, have a drink, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Now I can't speak on behalf of this compared to all the other poutine joints in Montreal (since this was our first time trying poutine), but this is a great place. The service was pretty good and the regular poutine (gotta try the basic stuff first) was very yummy. I've had gravy fries before, but adding cheese curds is a pretty awesome addition. There's outside dining tables if it's a nice day out and you can grab a Unibroue beer to make it a really great meal! All in all, it's a good place, especially if it's your first time trying poutine!"}
{"text":"After coming in and trying the food at this place I can definitely say I am not a poutine person. Maybe it is an acquired taste. Nothing against this establishment in general, I just was not a big fan of the food. We got the smoked meat poutine which is basically French fries with gravy and cheese and smoked meat on top. It didn't look or taste appetizing. I love fries but I realized I can't have them with gravy. I found myself digging through the food to find the French fries not touched by the meat or gravy. The smoked meat was ok, nothing too memorable about it."}
{"text":"What's my name? It's Poutine-tain. Ask me again and I'll tell you the same.  I didn't feel this place was a tourist trap. You want poutine, right? They sell poutine in a casual and lively atmosphere. And guess what, their poutine isn't bad. It's actually pretty good.  You get a lot of poutine for around $10. When I visited, many patrons where sharing theirs but I ate 2/3rds of mine. I was starving and hadn't eaten anything all day. Kudos to you if you can eat the entire thing by yourself. It's a fairly cheap and filling meal, packed with a ton of calories.  The service was friendly and my server was quite the chatter box. He informed me that another Montréal Poutine exists elsewhere in Montréal. But now after a brief internet search I can't find it anywhere. Maybe I misunderstood him.  By the way, this place also own the crêpes business upstairs. So if poutine ain't your thang, there's always crêpes waiting for you upstairs."}
{"text":"We were in old Montreal between Christmas and New Year's 2014- cold and hungry. Worst mistake was stopping into Montreal Poutine for lunch. Up a flight of dingy stairs and then we were shocked. It looked unfinished, grungy and totally disorganized. The place was full - possibly out of desperation for food - so we decided to stay and give it a chance.  No one greeted us at the door and it was \"find your own table\". The tables AND chairs were worn and dirty.  My husband had to wipe off some wet substance on his chair before sitting. The kitchen was in the basement and there was some kind of loud rukus going on down there for quite some time.  After waiting for 25 minutes we finally had a server. We were told out of eight items on the menu only the top three were available. We ordered Sangria - no Sangria, we ordered a glass of wine - no wine - what was available? - beer, beer and beer. Didn't management think to go to the liquor store and stock up?? The poutine and pulled pork were cold when we finally got it. The Cheese curds were cold and not melty, just thrown on top. We finished up and tried to pay with a credit card - strange - other people have also noted - credit cards don't work here. Cash only - don't need to declare it??? After paying with cash and tipping, I was then told by our server I had not given her enough tip!! Who says that to a customer - RUDE!! I then politely answered \"that is all you are getting\" and I should have taken back the tip I did give her. My family could not stop discussing this terrible experience. Over all this was a really horrendous experience.  We did enjoy an Italian restaurant in Old Montreal for dinner and a quaint Irish Pub for terrific Fish and Chips.  Live and learn...... Visited December 2014"}
{"text":"Yes it's touristy, and I'm sure there's better poutine elsewhere, but what made this place awesome for my husband and I was the waiter who helped us. It was a cold November night(no tourists in sight...besides us that is.) and we just wanted to stroll in old town(I was craving poutine, even though we had just finished dinner on Blvd. Saint-Laurent) so we decided to pop in. It was actually nice to walk on the cobble stone streets of old town without any people(very serene and a little spoooooky!)   I wish I remember the name of the waiter who helped us but he was awesome! Since there was no one else in the shop he put on Bhangra music for us(asked us what we wanted to listen to gave us some options) He gave my husband a beer suggestion and pulled up a chair right next to us to chat( we didn't mind at all and actually welcomed it). He talked about paragliding in Belize and life in Montreal, while we talked to him about life in NY. He was just so laid back and fun to talk to.   My husband and I split a veggie poutine and it more than enough gluttony for two people. It was served piping hot and with a little tabasco, hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and the server was friendly. Enjoyed the pitcher of sangria and smoked meat poutine. Right in the heart of old Montreal. Loved the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Ok poutine combined with the rudest servers I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. Best  example of an angry Pequiste with an attitude!"}
{"text":"Fair poutine... Definitely not the best I've had. I guess I expected more than a one room restaurant with cheap furniture. Pizza was good for the kids, wife had the poutine and I had the smoked meat sandwich which was similar to a pastrami sandwich. Good for a quick meal but not a top spot in Montreal that I would recommend"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Very limited dinner menu and limited drink menu.  Service was very poor.  Rarely saw our waitress.  Poutine was over priced fries were average toppings pretty bland.   I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"What is poutine? French fries topped with cheese curds and smothered in brown gravy. What are cheese curds? Kinda like rubbery salty cheesy lumps - some people like them but I'm not one of them. Should you try poutine? In my opinion: once, just to get that off your check list.  Ok, having decided you want poutine, should you get yours at Montreal Poutine? Here's a hint: google \"Best Poutine In Montreal\" and a page from thrillist.com comes up. It lists 5 \"best places for poutine\" in Montreal. And guess what? Montreal Poutine is not mentioned. I haven't tried the other places but from what I have seen of Montreal Poutine I'm not surprised it didn't make their list.  My wife had the poutine and I had fries with gravy (poutine minus the cheese curds). For a place specializing in french fries these were pretty unimpressive: short irregular sized potato pieces that were pretty soggy - even the ones that escaped drowning in gravy. And the gravy: way too much - as I said, the fries were drowning in it. And it was brown and salty but not particularly flavorful. I can't comment on the cheese curds but my wife said they were ok.  They do have many optional toppings: poutine with chicken, sausage, smoked meat, bacon, etc. which would probably make this boring dish more interesting. I'd probably recommend that if you must have poutine. But we were just in for a snack so we got the basic.  Lots of other things like burgers, pizza, salads, etc.  for those who've already got the poutine urge out of their system.  Why do they have beer but no wine?   We asked for water and they said they only have bottled water! What? You can't open a tap and fill a glass with free water like basically every other establishment anywhere would do? There are only two possible explanations; 1: you're  greedy and trying to extract every last dime from the customer or 2: your water is unsafe to drink in which case you shouldn't be cooking with it or using it in any way in your restaurant.   I should take 1 point off for the water issue but I'm already at 2 stars so we'll leave it at that. Find someplace else to eat - you can do better."}
{"text":"My first time ever trying poutine so I have nothing else to compare it to, but Montreal Poutine serves up a solidly delicious plate of poutine!    Cheese \"curds\" with gravy top French fries.   This comfort food leans on the heavy side, but really hits the spot when you're looking for something good to eat.  It looks like clumps of soft feta cheese, but the bite and flavor remind me more of mozzarella.  And the portions?  GRANDE - I mean, big heaping mound of fries, slap some thick gravy on top and then top with the queso.    Friendly and upbeat employees made me smile :).  If you're doing take-out, you have to do it from a separate entrance.    Don't expect this to be an upscale dinery ... very laid-back and chill atmosphere.  Part of their \"restaurant\" extends out onto the streets of Old Quebec.  There is a \"secret\" jardin in the back that allows you to bask in happy peace until you are ready to join the busy streets of Old Montreal (highly recommended)."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!   RUN AWAY!!  We were hustled by a man outdoors who dragged us down into a chilly basement bar to sell us in having a meal there. Total tourist trap. My wife ordered a glass of red wine from the menu and we were told they had no red wine. The waitress brought a glass of white wine from a box and charged $5.40. As we are from California and can get a bottle of Mondavi for $5.40 we were suitably both traumatized and horrified at the same time........ Such a shame for such a wonderful place as Vieux Montreal."}
{"text":"We wanted the try Montreal's famous Poutine and strolling past here we thought it would be a great spot.  They were very welcoming and our waitress was awesome.  She really pumped us up for the poutine and said would take it personally if we didn't really love it which was cut and nice to have staff like that who promotes the food so well.  The poutine arrived and not something you find in the states.  We dove right in and loved it.  The gravy was rich and full of flavor, fries cooked up just right without a greasy taste and the cheese curds onto were very fresh.  Our first venture with poutine was a great one thanks to Montreal Poutine's good food and great service.  See you our next visit!"}
{"text":"Let's keep it simple, just like the folks at Montreal Poutine. I had the classic Poutine while my wife had the fried onion Poutine. Both arrived piping hot and both were very tasty. The best part, for me, was the fact that the gravy was light and flavourful And though the fries and curds were well covered, they weren't swimming in the gravy. This allowed a good portion of the fries to maintain their crispy texture.  Fresh potatoes, flavourful gravy,  soft curds and crispy fries made for many perfect bites. And to top things off, they had a GREAT 80's playlist going on in the background in a fantastic laid back patio area. A must visit if you find yourself in Old Montreal with a Poutine craving!"}
{"text":"More like pooptine. They were out of everything, sad face. There is a fleur de lis on the door though so that was ok."}
{"text":"this review is for one of the three adjoining restaurants. this place is what is printed on the receipt. I can't believe how filthy this place was. the guy cutting strawberries in the dining room, no gloves, was playing with his phone and scratching his ears and other parts of himself. they use the same batter for sweet and savory crepes. got grossed out after a few bites and had to leave."}
{"text":"Service was ehh. Servings were not proportionate for the cost. Have to walk up a flight of stairs, so, it's not friendly for all. Poutine was slightly above average."}
{"text":"Delicious. The cartons of Kirkland smoked meat were stocked up off to the side (so, not authentic) and the service begins with a surly \"oui?\" but the poutine though probably geared towards us tourists was the best I've had! The toppings cheese and gravy were very generous and two of us were stuffed for under $10. We took the food to go and there are plenty of nice places to eat nearby. Will probably go crawling back for more."}
{"text":"The poutine was ok. Not bad, not amazing.   The  goat cheese salad cost me 12 dollars and came with about 3 leafs and four pieces of bread. Not exactly what I paid for. For what it's worth, the salad was pretty good.   They also don't have any tap water, which seems like a complete racket to me"}
{"text":"Nestled above the street in Old Montreal, this is a dim, slightly cramped space that serves up incredible food. The staff are friendly and bilingual, the portions are large and reasonable, and with some iconic Montreal items on the menu, this is a great place to cap off your experience in the city.  It's crowded, sometimes there's a line, and often the windows are open so birds fly in. Birds above my food is a pretty stressful eating arrangement. But if you can get one of the coveted seats above the street you'll have a great view.   Great poutine, but makes you feel lik a sardine. 4/5"}
{"text":"You can't visit Montreal and not try their poutine. It is the origin of the amazing dish, and thus I had high expectation. We ordered the Italian poutine, the hotdog poutine and the smoked sandwich. A word of warning, if you are expecting a large variety of food, this isn't your place. There was the Montreal smoked meat sandwich and one type of burger. That's it. Everything else was poutine. Again, I had high expectations so this was a disappointment.  The sausage was hard and the hotdogs were bland. Nothing about that combination really tasted good. I was quite disappointed. The actual poutine was ok though. The smoked meat sandwich was very good if not small.   The atmosphere was dark, but was really got me was that the place was understaffed. This made the wait long. I was not impressed with that. When the food came out it was warm, not hot. It seemed like the food was out waiting for the staff to deliver the food. Overall, meh....  Pro Smoked meat sandwich was very good  Con Understaffed Not hot food Italian sausage was hard"}
{"text":"Poutine,* one of the best combos that ever came into existence. Thick cut fries, flavorful gravy and creamy, cheesy curd melting all over that business.   My friend and I were determined to try as much Poutine as possible during our short weekend in Montreal and when we saw the sign for Montreal Poutine during our walk through Vieux Montreal, we had to stop.  We were seated in the back patio, which was very pleasantly shaded with trees and the ambiance was bustling if nothing else. Our Poutine arrived with mushrooms and onions and a side of smoked meat for my friend. With two pints in hand, we dug in and it was good. Not spectacular, but pretty darn tasty.  All in all a great little pit stop on a meandering kind of day.  *not to be confused with Disco fries. It's all in the cheese, you know."}
{"text":"Terrasse sympa pour une petite Poutine rapide après notre arrivée de France. Ça ravigote avec une bonne pinte de rousse !"}
{"text":"Nice courtyard. Fries are good  poutine is OK. Remainder of food is way below expectation for the area and definitely the price."}
{"text":"The service here is DREADFUL.  They promise quick and attentive service, but it's anything but that.  We ordered a burger and a smoked meat sandwich with a side order of poutine.  After waiting 25 minutes what we got was the smoked meat sandwich and a side order of poutine and a very large order of poutine (no burger).  When we agreed take the poutine rather than wait another 25 minutes for a burger, they charged us the price of the burger!    This represents the worst of Montreal tourist trap crap.  Walk a few extra blocks away from Vieux Montreal for some decent service."}
{"text":"Tasty. Probably not the best introduction to poutine but it was good enough. I got the smoked meat poutine. The fries and gravy were good but the meat was a little bland. I sat in the courtyard which was nice."}
{"text":"This is the most boring place you could possibly go to get poutine in Montreal. Honestly, St. Hubert express is more worth your time than this place. It's so slow and everything is over cooked and subpar. No creativity with the food here...   Thoroughly disappointed. My compatriots and I were on the prowl for a nice spot to grab lunch in old Montreal, much to my dismay they were caressed inside by the host outdoors. Lured in by promises of poutine and moderately priced beer.  We sat down upstairs, no music, very cramped, crappy tables, and uncomfortable chairs.  It took about 10 minutes for a waiter to come and talk to us and take our orders. When we finally got our food after about 35 minutes it was overcooked and bland. Burger was very dry and tough to eat. Also they don't have tap water...? Whatever, don't go here. You're wasting your time."}
{"text":"Came here on a very busy, hot day. The poutine was pretty good, however service was not stellar. Our waitress left us for a long time and wanting to order another dish, we finally asked another server for the food, but he got the order wrong. There are two washrooms upstairs but a long line for them. Also, I dislike how smoking is allowed in the patio just because personally I do not enjoy breathing second hand smoke while trying to eat a meal."}
{"text":"For a tourist trap the poutine was delicious.  I am very happy to write that my poutine cherry has been popped by Montreal Poutine. This was our first time eating poutine and our first time visiting Montreal.   So all year long I have been planning to eat my first poutine in Montreal and I  got to live that dream in August.  Reading up on Poutine I discovered the curds have to squeak when you bite into them and they did.  I ordered the poutine with bacon on top and my boyfriend ordered the poutine with hot Italian sausage.  Both were delicious.   Instead of getting bacon bits or chopped pieces of bacon Montreal Poutine serves the bacon topped poutine with BACON STRIPS crispy delicious BACON strips.  Well before I even took my first bite I knew I would love it.  The fries were not hot enough to have been cooked to order...but the poutine came out warm topped with a tasty brown gravy cheese curds and bacon.  The portions are simply huge if you're  going as a twosome I'd suggest getting one poutine to split.  Also for an appetizer we ordered a brie cheese rolled in pistachios, I loved the subtle flavors of the cheese and this app was served with sliced toasted bread.   I really looking forward to recreating the brie dish at home."}
{"text":"Simone and I just got back from another trip to Montreal, Canada. I love going to Canada for this reason-  Poutine. Although it sounds kinda dirty to say it, Poutine is actually a food. French Fries (preferably fresh cut) topped with Gravy and Cheese Curds. Simple and yet one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth - and I'm not telling you what other things that list includes. In my opinion (which of course is always right) the best place in the city to get Poutine is in the old city, on 161 Rue Saint Paul, at the smartly named Montreal Poutine.  The restaurant is divided into two areas, one for seating and one for take out, and its oddly separated by a gift shop in the middle. In the summer there is also outdoor seating along the street.  The day we went it was 20 degrees outside so inside dining was the only choice.  When we got to the door we tried the latch and couldn't open it. Obviously we thought the place was closed. However as we started to walk away a gentlemen (who was either homeless or worked there) let us know to just give the door a push, so thus we did and we made our way inside.  Once in the door we looked around for a minute at the empty place and waited to perhaps see a waitress, after a few moments a rather attractive young lady popped her head out from around the corner and offered us a seat. She apologized for not hearing us come in and I explained to her that it was okay and that she had just missed our wrestling match with the front door. She informed us that not only did the door not work, but neither did some of the lights, the toilet or most of the windows and because the restaurant is divided into two sections she was actually going to have to walk through a window to the outside and around the building to place our order and then bring us the food. Not noticing her wool hat and heavy sweater, I laughed and thought she was kidding.  She informed me that she was not at all kidding and that \"being an old building, the waitresses get screwed\" Wow ! After the honest opinion that she shared with us I could only think one thing- lets eat some Poutine !   The menu is pretty simple. There is about ten kinds of Poutine, a small sandwich menu ( including Montreal's other famous dish smoked meat) salads, and  very good Pizza flat breads. For my choice I went for the classic Poutine, and a smoked meat sandwich. Simone got a little crazy and had her Poutine topped with Mushrooms and Onions. When the waitress opened the window and stepped through with our order I thought it may be a good time to take a picture. I however decided not to do this because people don't usually enjoy being screwed and having it captured on film. Later in the meal , I did manage to get a photo while she did some entry window insulation repairs and I must say she looked good both entering and exiting the window.  Now back to the meal !  My Poutine and smoked meat sandwich arrived and both looked great. The home made French Fries were topped with vegetarian gravy ( that tasted like some really fresh roasted chicken pan drippings) and loaded with a generous portion of mild cheese curds. The dish was not at all salty and the cheese had just started to melt into the gravy that was coating the crispy hot fries. YUM,YUM,YUM.  The smoked meat sandwich was also delicious, It had a mountain of thinly sliced pickled beef brisket resting between to slices of moist Rye bread.  It was tender and smokey and served with mustard . I finished every last bite. The plate also came with a small salad on it, which was a bit of a waste for me, but Simone took care of eating it.  Simones mushroom and Onion Poutine was like mine, with a vegetarian ( still tastes like chicken) gravy and cheese curds. I thought the onions were a bit overpowering and took away from the flavor of the rest of the dish , but i did enjoy the mushrooms.  I love this place. It definitely has an old city vibe. The brick wall are falling apart, the windows rattle, the door is broken and the waitress have an honest but fun attitude. Its the real Poutine experience with no frills, just really good food. The doctor probably would not suggest this as part of your daily diet ,however, when you are in town, don't  miss this place in the old city. Five stars"}
{"text":"Great outside seating....good service....must have the regular poutine.  Wi-Fi is on the 3rd floor so be aware."}
{"text":"I have discovered my newest addiction/sin, and it is poutine.  French fries, gravy and cheese curds comprise the base of a poutine, but quality establishments can raise this basic variety into an art form.   Montreal Poutine does just this.   This wonderful eatery has two different seating areas: one indoors, which looks a bit like a rough-and-ready chip shop type place - somewhere to grab a mess of business to go and walk about the International Quarter.  A few steps away, however, is a dreamy outdoor courtyard sheltered on all sides by green leafy branches, with just the right amount of glorious sunlight illuminating the wooden tables, the miniature gardens and water fountains, where one can feast in arborial splendor.   Montreal Poutine sells more than just the Canadian delicacy, to be sure - their flatbread pizzas are tasty as well, but I was here for the glory, and the glory I would have.  I got no further than the section titled \"LE SMOKED MEAT\", and my choice was made.    Sheer joy:  - Gravy perfection - Gooey, melted cheese curds. - Fries crispy where they remain untouched by the delicious brown - cubelets of what can only be affectionately dubbed \"Le Smoked Meat\"  Mother of pearl, this was a wonderful meal - with a couple large pints of Sleeman Lager (another uniquely Canadian treat), I could easily have passed into the next world satisfied with my experience.   Overly effusive? Perhaps. But am I a fan of this place? Of that there is little doubt, I trust."}
{"text":"I have to say, for a \"tourist\" restaurant, I enjoyed my lunch here.  First off, with the horrid humidity outside, it was way too hot to eat out in the patio.  The main dining room upstairs was not open.  However, the staff was very accommodating to us and we were able to eat in the air conditioned upstairs dining room.  Ordered the Italian meat sauce poutine and, even though it didn't even resemble a meat sauce, was seriously tasty.  Tried the spicy Italian sausage poutine and the gravy alone was so good.  Load up on beer, get a good buzz going and come eat here.  Awesome I'm drunk and need something in my stomach before I barf food.  Touristy, but still good.  Only negative is you'll pay double here for the same thing elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"The best poutine we've had during our stay in Montreal. Excellent service, comfortable outside seating. Not expensive."}
{"text":"Ate a hot dog and regular poutine. The poutine had large squeaky curds, tasty gravy and decent fries. It was good. I loved walking through the old town and the old look inside the restaurant. Service was good enough. Cost was more than expected. There was no TV so I couldn't watch the hockey game...and they call themselves Canadian?"}
{"text":"As tourist to Montreal we had to have poutine and this was the first place that came up on a search so we gave it a try. This is very geared to tourist and the menu and price definently show it. Despite that the food is great. We had the smoked meat sandwiches, plain poutine and the onion poutine. In my non expert opinion everything was great. The poutine had two different gravies on it and both were really tasty. The fries were cooked to perfection and there was a lot of cheese.  We sat upstairs and the waiter was way overworked and did not get to us as often as I would have liked, specially to refill my beer. Price was pretty high but considering the location and clientelle its in the right range"}
{"text":"So we all know that the poutine originated in Quebec but everyone has their own taste and everyone has a story as to who makes the best poutine.  After my last visit in Montreal I learned that multiple people have said that Montreal Poutine is the best of the best.  Well the name says it all and should speak for itself.  In the heart of Old Montreal this place is surrounded by many many restaurants and cafe's and many other places that sell poutine.  Its a cute little places with a hidden patio along with a nice sitting area inside.  I ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat Poutine.  Can you get any more original than that lol.  The portion seemed small but don't be fooled it was plenty of food and was actually quite heavy.  The cheese curds were slightly larger than the smoked meat pieces which was perfect.  The gravy was smooth and not to thick just perfect.  The fries still remained perfectly crispy even after the gravy was sitting in them for a while.  I have to say it was a perfect poutine and everything you should expect and want from a poutine in Montreal.  Montreal Poutine is as french Canadian as you can get and is a must try when in old Montreal."}
{"text":"I'm guessing that this place is sort of a tourist trap, but it's alright taking that into consideration.  We sat down here for a couple beers and final poutine before we departed to Miami.   *They had a pretty good beer selection - this was actually the first place I saw any of the Unibroue beers offered, which I found odd since I'd expected to see them all over Canada.  *I would say the poutine was not bad (we chose chicken), but after having had a couple better ones throughout the trip I was left a little underwhelmed.  *The best part about this place was the terrace, although it seems Montreal has perfected the art of the outdoor terrace so again, less exciting simply due to comparison.  *Service was meh. I guess the waitress was ok, but I couldn't pick her out of a lineup of one which is a sure sign of average. *Prices were reasonable and portion sizes pretty large.   Overall, I felt like this place was ok. Not a bad choice by any means, but there are definitely better choices for poutine OR having a couple drinks."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum!   When I visited Montreal on a tight budget, I needed to find a place that would give me the most bang for my buck! Traveling on Rue Saint Paul East, a street filled with steakhouses and bars, I was happy to find this gem.   I ordered \"The House Burger\" and it was delicious. It was fresh, well made, and included the most delicious, crisp, and potato filled french fries.   The lemonade tasted was made out of concentrate and was a little disappointing, but it didn't spoil the meal.   Go try it! :)"}
{"text":"I tried regular poutine, it's not that bad but really oily and fatty, which you can tell from its ingredients. My friend tried smoked meat poutine. Well, obviously smoked meat is far behind those in Schwartz but simply an experience of local food."}
{"text":"Went here to get some poutine. Ended up getting a regular one with mushrooms and onions. Big mistake. Everything else was great, but the mushrooms really overpowered everything. If we got it without mushrooms, I would definitely have given it 4* Portion was huge and it was kind of expensive at about $7. Would come back here though."}
{"text":"\"This would be good, nay amazing, if I were drunk.\"  Got the warning/rec from Ad and she was spot on. It's a perfectly fine, heavy dish and you shouldn't get anything else. A thin gravy covers cheese curds over browned fries (should we call them québécois fries?). I made it about a third through the plate when I gave up, but I was sober.   The servers are cheeky college kids rocking out to radiohead. Broken glass and remnants of past diners littered under the back deck.   Go for drunk food, share with friends.  Lost points for letting a group of rude teenagers smoke right next to me. Gross. Also thanks for asking whether I'd mind. (in case my sarcasm doesn't translate, they didn't ask)  (2.5)"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Montreal so I wanted 2 things for dinner: Montreal Smoked Meat and Poutine! Because of my hotel's location I decided to try this place out for poutine, and hoped that they might have some smoked meat too. No luck on the meat, but there was a lot of poutine on the menu (as the restaurant name suggests).   However, dinner was ultimately a disappointment. I've had poutine many times before, and this one was just not very good. First of all, the gravy was watery and didn't have much depth to it. I ordered the poutine with fried chicken on it, and the chicken tasted freezer burnt to me - really dry and stringy. The curds and fries were decent, but poutine really shouldn't be difficult to make so this was really disappointing. It was really expensive for what it was too -- $10 for a beer (is this a normal price in Montreal? Seems expensive) and $13.50 for the poutine...I could have gone to KFC for a poutine at half price that would taste miles better.  Finally, I guess because of the time of year there wasn't much going on in Old Montreal. There was only 1 other table when I arrived, and they left before me so it was a bit awkward to be the only person eating in the restaurant. Not really the restaurant's fault so I take no stars away for that, but still worth it to note. I probably wouldn't have gone in at all if I could have seen what the situation was like from outside, but as it is, the restaurant is located upstairs so by the time I saw that it was a ghost town it was too awkward to leave."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat poutine I've ever tasted! The servers were very friendly and efficient.   I only gave three stars because I think that the restaurant is definitely in need of some renovation especially the stairs, bathrooms, and the drapes need some washing. However we're definitely coming back for more if we ever visit Montreal in the future."}
{"text":"Hurray for Poutine - you sound obscene but you are very tasty! French fries with beef gravy and cheese curds. Very yummy. Not sure if this is the best poutine in Canada, but it was a nice introduction!!"}
{"text":"Très déçu. J'ai commandé une Poutine (9$) et une bouteille d'eau (3$). Portion correct. Sauce brune un peu fade et un peu radin pour le fromage. Resto à éviter.   Their smoke meat sandwich was not at all worth the $17 they charge. We were very disappointed that it was not at all authentic to Montreal mile high sandwich. Unfortunate rip off for tourist.. would not recommend."}
{"text":"Poutine is good. Service is poor. Super unsanitize. Wheelchair inaccessible. Saw a staff picking napkins off the floor and putting it behind the counter for the next customers. The tree above the guest tables adds a nice decorative touch to the atmosphere, but it keeps on dropping seeds and leave on our food. They also do not service glass water and forces customer to pay $2.5 per bottle of water. Staffing for each guest table is very unorganized. We have no designated server, and every one is too busy to serve us. I even saw one table's customer coming in for more than 15 minutes and still one serves them. They even have to find a table cloth themselves and clean up their own table before anyone goes up to them. Again food is okay but I will definitely not come here again because of their poor customer service and unsanitary reason. Bad experience here."}
{"text":"It may have been tres touristy, but it was the first thing open when we were deciding where to head to lunch and the back outside courtyard was adorable! We had the place almost to ourselves since we were a tad early. We wanted poutine and smoked meat and that's what we got! We weren't disappointed. The food was pretty decent - the service ok - our server was being trained - which was fine. We both liked our meals and appreciated the salad that came with our sandwiches. Having never had poutine there seemed to be plenty of gravy and cheese curds on it for us and the smoked meat sandwich was excellent."}
{"text":"Les frites et le fromage étaient froids, les serveuses étaient bien sympathiques mais peinaient en français ET en anglais, et ne semblaient pas pouvoir me renseigner sur les environs. J'espère avoir Été une exception, surtout à ce prix-là"}
{"text":"Nothing much to say except for AMAZING!! I'm from New York and we don't have poutin there so I was very excited to try it for the first time. I have to say I'm very impressed . Very flavorful too"}
{"text":"Everyone is friendly and nice. The time for the food to come was a little too long but I enjoyed the atmosphere and my beer. It's a tourist trap but at times it does have it's locals at a certain hour. They have every kind of beer in the rainbow."}
{"text":"This was my first poutine experience and I was not disappointed. We ordered the smoked meat poutine, 2 burgers and a pitcher of beer.   The poutine was delicious. It was drowning in gravy and cheese chunks and topped with chopped meat. The portion was large and more than enough to share between myself and a friend.   The burger was cooked well and decent. It was nothing fancy - meat, bun, cheese, lettuce and tomato. It came with a side of fries which you can imagine we needed to take to go since we were filled with poutine.   The service was good. There were only 3 other tables so the server was pretty attentive. The price was decent for the portions that we received. Location is great - right in the heart of the Old Port.   Overall a really great experience and would definitely recommend for a quick bite or a nice sit down meal."}
{"text":"Poutine was high on our list of things to try in Montreal. Cafe Poutine was a clear stop given it's name and location in touristy, Old Montreal location. The restaurant was small and crowded...it was tough  trying to get between the tables.   The menu was promising - tons of Poutine options as well as sandwiches with a side of poutine as an option. My fiance had the poutine with smoked meat and I had the chicken, apple and brie sandwich- no poutine (I figured I could share). The portions were huge - I had a pile of fries on my plate (even though I had asked for no fries). The poutine was okay, not as mind-blowing as fries with cheese and gravy promised to be. My sandwich was so delicious. The baguette was perfectly toasted and the brie and apples were a great compliment.  The service was hurried and not very accommodating. i asked for no cheese on the sandwich, which they said wasn't possible. They also missed the no fries request.  The prices were also high- 2 waters, smoked meat poutine and a chicken sandwich set us back 35 CA. It makes sense for the district, but not for the overall experience.  Bottom line - if you're in the area and don't want to dig for poutine, this would be an ok stop. If you're looking for and awesome poutine experience, keep on walking."}
{"text":"Montreal Poutine provided unprofessional customer service. It also feels like a tourist trap on the busy, touristy Rue St Paul.   The poutine was okay, but the customer service really left a terrible last impression. First, it took 45 minutes for the poutine to arrive, and the restaurant was only moderately busy. On a hot day, where the tables were in the sun, the servers did not take the time to check on our table or ask if our water (or beverages) were refilled. There was very little attention paid during our entire visit. Once the food arrived, the server checked on us once. Again, the servers did not ask if we wanted any beverage refills or needed anything.   Second, when the bill arrived, the server directly pointed out the recommended service fees. Given the extremely lackluster dining experience, and the correlation between good service and tips, we had paid (and tipped), but the server did not want to let us leave until we tipped her the amount she had anticipated.   Given this undesirable last impression, just to leave the restaurant without further hassling from the server, I tipped her the amount she wanted. I wouldn't recommend that others visit the restaurant until the customer service improves. In contrast, La Banquise, despite its hectic, busy atmosphere provided both great poutine, along with stellar customer service."}
{"text":"I don't know poutine well, but this seemed good to me.  A few good draft beer choices, some cafe tables on St. Paul - healthy choices for those who want them, and decent poutine.  Vegetarian.  In Old Montreal, I doubt you'll find better.  Location can't be beat."}
{"text":"This was just the place I was looking for. I wanted to try authentic poutine while visiting Montreal and what better place to go than a place called Montreal Poutine!?  My husband and I stopped here for lunch.  There were a few different options for poutine. I ordered poutine with hot dog sausage and my hubby got it with chicken. It was  delicious!! The portions were very generous. I skipped breakfast and I still couldn't finish mine.  The service was a little slow at first but once we ordered we got our food quick and the staff was very friendly. We sat in an outdoor courtyard under umbrellas since it was raining a little bit. I loved the ambiance. I would definitely recommend this for someone new to Montreal and poutine!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Montreal Poutine for a late lunch. Wanted to try poutine. Underwhelmed as far as the poutine goes. As for Montreal Poutine establishment, decent tavern, good beer, good place to hang out for a drink and sample the poutine but not exactly a find dining establishment, not that it was meant or trying to be that."}
{"text":"What makes this place remarkable are the staff...pleasant, professional, welcoming....the food is Poutine...different types...large portions...good beer....I grew up here and was surprised to find that what we would eat on ski hills with cider and beer is now a tourist draw. However, this place is worth visiting particularly if you have visitors with you. The staff is great and the entire experience a pleasure ...BRAVO!!!"}
{"text":"I've definitely had better poutine, but given the area this is probably some of the better you'll get in the neighborhood.  The product that gets the most marks here is more likely the namesake t-shirt rather than their poutine.  It's still delicious poutine, but once you've had amazing poutine with perfect cheese curds it's difficult not to compare.  Their classic poutine with just the curds, fries and gravy is ok but I would recommend going with a poutine with some additions like bacon added to it.  It'll curb your craving temporarily, but you'll undoubtedly be left craving for something a little tastier shortly after."}
{"text":"How is it that America has yet to discover poutine (or, rather, how is it that poutine wasn't invented by the Americans)? French fries, slathered in gravy, drowned in cheese curds and occasionally submerged by a meat topping, if you so desire? It's just the sort of disgustingly delicious fare that Americans seem to crave. Perhaps it's good that it's only available up here, otherwise I'd be back home eating it every day and packing on the pounds. Anyhow...  Hungry, looking for a quick and tasty bite and acting more touristy than I'd care to admit, I stopped in Montreal Poutine looking for some good Canadian fare. Having heard a little about poutine, I was initially surprised to learn that the base poutine was in fact vegetarian (I later found out that this isn't an uncommon occurrence, but at the time it was a selling point). I ordered the avocado fries and poutine with mushrooms and onions. The avocado fries had the most interesting texture and came with a little pot of creme fraiche (excuse lack of accented letters), which ended up being the perfect dip -- I wouldn't have wanted anything more complex.  Poutine is most certainly not my specialty, but I was pleased with what the server presented me. The onions were well-caramelized, the mushrooms were small and tasty, and the fries were a little too small for my tastes but otherwise very, very good. Those two dishes were not quite enough for two to share, but I definitely would not have wanted my own plate. Pair with a glass of sangria and it made for a very tasty late lunch. Service was decent but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"When walking through Old Town you work up an appetite viewing all the historic sights and art galleries. Why not stop for some pouting and a pitcher of beer to refuel? We ordered the chicken poutine and poutine with fried onions. It definitely hit the spot and the rustic building was a plus."}
{"text":"Slooooowwwwww service because the place is understaffed. It took forever for our order to be taken and for our food to be served. There were people trying to flag down servers left and right- like actually standing up from their tables and waving. I wouldn't have minded that, but our smoked meat poutine had some cold fries underneath the gravy- not cool."}
{"text":"Excellent poutine!  If you're here in the summer, eat in the back garden!  I've never been here in the winter but can only assume the back garden is closed.  All sorts of different types of poutine here, it's a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Commençons par les bonnes choses : la terrasse Est très belle, à l'abri et surtout au calme. Le choix sur le menu n'est pas énorme mais suffisant. Le staff d'accueil est beaucoup trop friendly : on est des clients pas ses amis du secondaire. On ne peut pas y aller avec une poussette ce qui est regrettable. 17$ pour un petit smoked meat et un petite poutine est excessif!  La bouffe était correcte mais décevante en rapport au prix. Finalement la chose qui m'a vraiment agacé : ils ne servent pas d'eau du robinet!!! Quoi ils n'ont pas de verre ni de robinet? Si mais ils veulent charger le 3$ de plus pour une bouteille d'eau qui a  coûté 10 fois moins. Et pour moi c'est du vol, de l'arnaque.  Je ne recommande pas du tout!"}
{"text":"So I'm in Montreal sightseeing and a little ways from Norte Dame Basillica is this poutine place.....we had to go up stairs and left me tell you the build is very old....like 200 years! Awesome looking! Perfect pairing to a classic Canadian dish....full disclosure they make pouting everywhere now in Canada and USA. But most use gravy from a box and mozzarella cheese...I make this weekly at home for the kids! The Poutine here is miles ahead of anything I've tried before. Fresh cut fries nothing special...the gravy though..I believe they use duck fat to make it taste so rich I could have drank that by the glass! Then the squeaky cheese or other wise know as cheese curds. The cheese stays intact instead of melting like mozzarella and makes a squishy noise when you eat it! Awesome. It is a meal in its self ....$9.00 best money spent in Montreal. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Has the crepes upstairs. They were awesome. Ingredients so fresh and tasty. Service was very helpful and spoke very good English. Also a beautiful old building with lots of character. Worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"Good poutine. Terrible, terrible service. Sangria was good as well. Sat out in the back in the garden terrace which was quite nice."}
{"text":"At first looks like a hole in the wall but once you enter there's a beautiful outdoor court like space that's nice and indoor seating too.   The staff was very friendly & helpful and the service was fast. R & I shared one smoked meat sandwich and one smoked meat poutine.   The sandwich wasn't, mind-blowing at all, it was decent. The portion kinda small though. I would give it a 6/10.   As for the smoked meat poutine, it was deadly! The gravy not too heavy and just tangy enough. The cheese was melting and getting messy in the best way. The fries cooked perfectly and the smoked meat gave a nice flavor to the dish. Overall it was deliciously addictive. Forget about the zillion calories and just dig in! 9/10  Because it's called poutine house I give them 4 stars but the sandwich didn't deserve that."}

{"text":"I don't know anything about poutine but, as a vegetarian, this was a FANTASTIC introduction!  The ambience leaves a lot to be desired for but the staff is super friendly and the Poutine was AMAZING!!!!  (I went for the mushroom & onion poutine)     If only I was still hungry in the slightest...  I would definitely order another one!    Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Bar Food, Beer and Outdoor?Indoor Seating. Great Overall. I would recommend this place to those in Old Montreal looking to get something to eat and drink while walking around in Old Montreal. Staff very friendly and helpful. If that guy in front out on the street didn't stop us, we would have never found it. Very small store front, Very huge seating area in back. Plenty of shade too. The Smoke Meat Sandwich is a little on the small side. Good for a snack. Ask for the burger instead. Fries with Cheese Curds and Poutine was very tasty."}
{"text":"Tourist trap but excellent Poutine nonetheless. I had the Poutine with smoked meat my wife went with the plain.  Both were excellent.  There is also an upstairs, which I believe is part of the same restaurant, where we had an outstanding crepe."}
{"text":"We visited Montreal on a cold winter day and wandered into Montreal poutine. The best thing going for this place is the location in old Montreal ... Unfortunately the prices are too high and the poutine was cold! Our smoked meat sandwiches were small for what we paid."}
{"text":"This is a huge tourist trap spot!  It's pretty huge with several floors and rooms.  There's a to go section, but when we went there, the guy directed us to eat in house because the poutine would be better that way.  We got the poutine with fried onions and mushrooms for $10, which was a HUGE serving of poutine!  I asked for tap water and they said they didn't have any.  Um....ok?  So I got the peach juice instead, which wasn't so great."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the lack of love for this place. Yeah, it's in a touristy area, but despite that I feel like this is overall a really nice little restaurant. I did not suffer the bad service other reviewers have complained of, so perhaps that is influencing my opinion.  If you sit near the window you'll get a nice view of the street below, great for people watching and relaxing. The poutine itself is delicious and on point; the gravy is ample, the curds are squeaky, and in my case the smoked meat was cooked just right. They also have a good selection of beer on tap, most from local craft breweries in Quebec, so you're sure to find something interesting to imbibe. Since it's a bit touristy the food here is perhaps a bit expensive for what it is, but who am I to judge, since the exchange rate was in my favor anyway. My meal here was tasty and I would come back again one day. I would say it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"Food was great...but the customer service was HORRIBLE. The seats were crowded. We were left hanging after we finished our food ... Waited 30 minutes for our server to come back and she never did. She was too busy chatting with what seemed like he friends. We had to get up and find her.  1 star."}
{"text":"SO delicious! This is the go-to for Montreal Poutine and smoked meat.  Being a New Yorker, I wasn't quite sure what the \"smoked meat\" was but my server was happy to explain that it is a slow smoked beef brisket sliced thin and served on rye bread with mustard.  It was smoked to perfection and the bread and mustard were a perfect accompaniment.   The Pulled Pork poutine was DELICIOUS! The pork had just the right amount of smoke flavor and the curds were fresh and melts and amazing. I will be visiting again my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Nice place to have poutine.  Friendly service"}
{"text":"We went to Montreal Poutine and sat on the 2nd floor for 15 minutes while up to 4 waiters/waitresses ignored us and the rest were on the terrace talking among them. We walked out and not one of them even blinked. Is that customer service? I don't think they need our business!"}
{"text":"This place rips! Came here on a trip for dreamhack Montreal, and the atmosphere was awesome. First time trying poutine and ended up have 2 orders shared with the table. Our server Jose was delightful :) highly recommend !! And speak English which is good for us Americans lol"}
{"text":"Not going to go in depth, but we got 2 take out poutines and they were not so good.    Fries looked suspiciously frozen and pre cut, where did all the skins go?    Cheese was melted not squeaky.    Many fries were undercooked as well unfortunately"}
{"text":"Good food in a great atmosphere in Old Montreal. As a first-timer to Montreal, I had to try poutine. I ordered the poutine with smoked meat and found it surprisingly delicious. The portion size is large enough for two and I shared a few bites with my family. Everyone enjoyed it.   We sat on the busy back terrace and the service was excellent. We never felt rushed and our food came out quickly. Sure, it's touristy, but it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place seemed like a tourist trap smack in the middle of Old Montreal. But when you are serving fries covered in cheese, gravy and meat-maybe a dive type trap is better?!?!? Stumbled in here late on a Saturday night........good Poutine and good beer selection-sat outback on patio and it seemed like some locals were eating here also. Recommendation-get the Poutine and beer and nothing else!!!  You don't go to Steak and Shake and get the salad-you know......"}
{"text":"So......how fat I wanted to get during my vacation?  Hm....let me think about this.....lol  I'm just like all American's, loving the French Fries + salt and pepper, then I went to Outback Steak House and discovered the Cheese Fries, and the Beacon Chess Fries, and..... now travel to Montreal I discovered they're more......to it, much much more...... lol   We was just walking around the old Montreal and my friend told me about Poutine, so I used my yelp apps and search what close by and this little restaurants popped up.   Great location, a train stop on the other side, I'm thinking approx .05 mile walking distance, you can check with the hotel concierge, the train there is very easy to take, it only cost $8.00 CAD for a whole day pass, you can ride as many times as you like all day.   So now back to the location, this little restaurant located in a good area, they're many shops walking distance  My friend and I decided to try out the Montreal Poutine since they're famous for that  The place set up like a little school cafeteria with cheap chairs and table that you can easily knock it down   The place is small, they're a small outdoor in the back They serve alcohol as well  I ordered the smoked meat Poutine and my friend ordered the Italian Poutine. I never had a Poutine before, and I thought it was pretty good, but the only problem is, I guess I hardly eat anything this greasy, so my stomach did not agree with me, and.... you know the rest. lol   If I travel to the area, I will stop by again for sure, but I will probably order 1 and share with my friends.   So make sure if you are travel to Montreal, go try out the famous POUTINE!! lol"}
{"text":"Came here on the advice of a friend who'd been around Montreal. The menu looked plain... devoid of any excesses.  I thought we were in the wrong place. As we were escorted in, a cozy patio opened up like the late flower in spring. Ordered the smoked meat poutine... just one for sharing.  Big mistake. It was delicious. We had to order another one... go for bacon she said. But I... I wanted pulled pork. For a second a standoff ensued, first one to blink loses. She lost her gaze and I won. Pulled pork it was. I forgot how the rest of the night went but yes go to this place. It's good."}
{"text":"The place is ridiculous!!!!!!!!! Before we go into the restaurant, there are 2 staffs standing at the door blocking your way. We tell them we have 5 people but they just won't let us in and said there will be 15mins wait. We don't mind but still they gave us nasty faces which you have no idea why!!!  We sat down and asked for water. Firstly they do not serve tap water. The server came back with Naya water and we realized they charge $3.5 each!! The menu has Eska water for $3.5 but they gave us Naya which is way cheaper!!!  It's definitely a scam.  Don't even go here, everything is stupidly overpriced and they served you like you are a stupid!"}
{"text":"This way the first place me and my girlfriend tried in Canada.  We had to try poutine and the atmosphere of this joint along with old Montreal interested us. We went in and was greeted by all nice staff members(maybe it's a Canadian thing... Everyone is nice here). And ordered poutine along with a burger(yes I was very hungry).   It was a flavor grand slam.   Poutine is common here but what really separates this place from others in my opinion is the service,  friendly staff,  and amazing outdoor atmosphere that had a beautiful ambiance,  and lighting... I loved everything about this place.   I would highly recommend it to all"}
{"text":"Delicious Poutine!  Beautiful outdoor setting with romantic lighting at night.  Very much enjoyed the courtyard, and will be back the next time I'm lucky enough to be in Montreal:)"}
{"text":"Good food and good service!!! A friend and I stopped in wanting to try the local dish and we were happy to find this nice little courtyard on a late warm afternoon.  We ordered 2 types (the sausage and smoked meat) and enjoyed both. Beers were good too!"}
{"text":"I don't care if it's all tourists here, there's something nice about eating poutine on the cobblestoned streets of Old Montreal. It doesn't make the poutine any less tasty: crisp fries, great gravy, and generous portions overall. You can definitely split one order between two people (if hungry) or three (if you're not greedy).  The beers are also a decent price, and there is ice cream - though we ended up going down the street to the maple store for dessert."}
{"text":"The regular poutine was the perfect afternoon split snack paired with a beer. The fries were cooked well but the cheese curds and gravy made the dish complete. We sat in the courtyard, it was nice and cool. Would go back to try different poutines."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent trip to Montreal. It's in the old city so prices are a little inflated. We stayed away from the avocado fries thanks to some reviews we read. The owner was a bit pushy/weird in a way that people who have been to Mediterranean countries might relate to and wanted us to sit outside when it was freezing, an offer we politely declined. However, the waiter kept coming in and leaving the door open and there was a small window missing right behind me. Thank buddah (literally) that I was able to scoot one of the many random buddah statues right in front of it so I did not freeze to death. Food was good. We stuck to poutine and beer. It's very hard to mess that up. Even KFC/PFK has a hard time making bad poutine. Tipping is a bit odd in Canada if you are not aware. When paying the server has to ask to add the tip right there. Our waitress was good but was overly excited when I said 20% that I was hoping she did not hear \"$20\" but even if she did it was (American) Thanksgiving so what the hell... Turns out she only heard 20% lol."}
{"text":"Had the poutine with onions and mushrooms. It was very tasty for my first time trying this dish.   I also tried a Nutella, banana and strawberry crepe upstairs. It was a more crispy than I would have liked.  The service was good overall"}
{"text":"Good environment, nice staff, poutine was pretty good"}
{"text":"Worst poutine I have ever eaten. They don't use the appropriate cheese to make their poutines. Tourist trap!"}
{"text":"Poutineeeee! There's a terrasse behind that's very pleasing. I took the smoked meat poutine and it wasn't so bad but my date had the regular and it was...regular. It's just a normal poutine, i expected it to be better"}
{"text":"What should I eat on a sweltering hot-ass day?  Hot-ass fries with hot-ass cheese and hot-ass gravy. Ugh.  Poutine was good."}
{"text":"Just visiting.  It was just before noon, was already hot and muggy and we were hungry and thirsty.  Saw through the doors the wonderful courtyard, well shaded, perfect!  My wife and I shared a Regular Poutine, a French Garden Salad and a cool Ephemere aux Pommes beer.  It just hit the spot.    Being a noob at poutine, I was far from an expert but this plate was delicious - crunchy hot fries, tasty thick gravy, and the cheese tossed in which was melting perfectly.  The salad was fresh, tasty, cool and a great compliment.  The beer just finished it all off.     The place was just getting busy when we finished.   Hope to visit again!"}
{"text":"Poutine was average at best but service was abhorrent. Rude and tried to run up the bill by suggesting we needed far more food than actually reasonable. Also only offered bottles of water for kids instead of tap water....  just trying to run up bill.   To top it off they include tip when you pay.   Go elsewhere where you will get the respect and kindness that Montréal has to offer."}
{"text":"Stopped in with husband and kids for lunch while visiting Old Montreal as we had heard we needed to try good poutine. The little court yard was shady and quaint. We had a regular poutine and the spicy sausage. The sausage one was the same as the regular with just one sliced up sausage on top for about 3.50 more. The sausage was tasty though and we cut it up into small pieces and mixed it back in."}
{"text":"SO good.  We had the basic poutine which was just delicious.  Savored every bite and had to really debate whether to get another order and forget about our dinner reservation.  Highly recommend if you want some delicious poutine in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Again...it was raining and cold, we were hungry and needed shelter and food.  Poutine was on our list of food to try and we quickly walked across the street to check out the menu and saw a good variety of poutine. As we were reading the menu, a gentlemen looks like he's heading into the cafe and recommend that we go. Apparently he either works there or owns the place, after he seats us, he leaves the restaurant. And because I had a seat facing the window, I noticed that every time someone walks by and looks at the menu, he magically appears to \"lure\" people in. We were lured.  We ordered a couple of beers and shared a chicken poutine and a brie dip appetizer to share. The portions were generous. The chicken poutine was good - huge chucks of chickens served our fries, gravy and cheese. The brie dip was good as well. It was actually a brie spread, served with greens and toasted bread.  The service was good and prices were OK. It was about $15 pp."}
{"text":"Cute rear courtyard - snag a table here if you can in good weather -- outdoor heaters are present but quite spread apart, so dress warmly. The inside is a dump. The food is mediocre and overpriced - tourist trap."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get poutine in all of Montreal! The location is amazing (old Montreal), and the portions are huge! You can definitely share with one other person and you will both be full. :) They have a little patio too if you want to sit outside on a nice day."}
{"text":"While we were skeptical, as from the street it looks like a tourist trap, rest assured it is not.   There is a quaint courtyard just beyond the entrance and even more seating as you move through the establishment. Where you sit is irrelevant as the poutine will be hot and delicious at all seats. We got the regular and smoked meat versions. Go for the smoked meat-you won't be disappointed. Only drawback was they only had beer and sangria, no cider. Not an issue, just try one of the Canadian or local brews. And if you're lucky, you just might share desert with one of the owners. Nice guy!  We'll be returning if we have time. Otherwise, next trip!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have been to during my trip.  My smoked meat sandwich was tiny and overpriced.  My wife ordered the grilled chicken burger but there were no condiments/ sauce on it so she put on some mayonnaise.  She took one bite and said it was disgusting: the chicken was very dry, and there was absolutely no flavour to the burger.  When she told the waiter why she wasn't going to eat it, he just said okay, and brought us the bill.  He didn't seem concerned at all about what she told him, nor did he care when we mentioned that the sandwich was really small and underwhelming for the steep price.  Will not return and I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant in my life. Took 15-20 minutes just to get menus after being told to sit on the terrace with heated lamps, which we noticed weren't even working once we sat down. Then after another 15 minutes to place our order, which was a simple order of two poutines and one smoke meat sandwich with no mustard. We were then delivered one poutine, one french fry, and of course loads of mustard on a smoke meat sandwich (which was so small). Usually I'd be ok we an error but after clear specifying my order and it being repeated back to me I'd think it would be correct after waiting over 40 minutes for something so simple.   Anyways after ranting a bit I wouldn't suggest anyone to ever go here because the poutine doesn't compare to a real \"Montreal Poutine\" and the prices are way over priced for the size of meal you receive.   To put a long story short, take the trip to \"La Banquise\" and you'll get a real taste for a proper Montreal poutine. This place is a tourist trap!!"}
{"text":"Bottom line- if you want some tourist poutine- this will scratch that itch! Personally, once was enough for me.  Nice spot on the main waterfront stretch in old town. It was a nice day and they have outdoor seating so we said what the hell. We sat at the bar and I liked their cement bar. We ordered some beer and a poutine. Lucky for me- they had an extra one that someone ordered but didn't want so we got two for the price of one. I chit-chatted with the bartender for a bit about CrossFit and played cards. The poutine was good, but the venue was full of just tourists- not something I like at all.  Good poutine for the price- they have a large variety of types of poutine. If you're looking for a locals poutine place- keep walking."}
{"text":"Are you drunk? Are you starving because you went to a resto that serves miniscule portions? Yes? Find yourself a Montreal Poutine!  At $10, you better expect something yummy and well that's what I got. I got a smoked meat poutine which was absolutely LOADED with gravy, curds and meat. Out of all the poutines I tried on my latest trip, this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"We had a original poutine and a poutine with spicy Italian sausage. I love cheese chucks and gravy. However, I feel like the Italian sausage wasn't as good as I expected. It is just a regular sausage."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying Poutine and we absolutely loved it. The place is unique and the staff was great. We had a large party including kids and had a very relaxing lunch. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 starts for the ambiance. Really funky and great service. Drinks and food are good too."}
{"text":"Came here around 830pm on New Year's Day as it was one of the few places that were open. Service was friendly but the food was very small-portioned. Had the smoked meat sandwich and pizza. Pizza was very thin and tasted like cheese on crackers. They don't offer water so I got the peach juice which was almost the same price as bottled water and tasted like a powder mix.  Don't think the food was worth the price but it's in a tourist area so I'm not surprised. Overall it's somewhere I'm glad I tried but probably won't return."}
{"text":"We stopped in to get one thing: Poutine. Fast, hot, poutine. It felt like we were waiting for the potatoes to grow. And then, the fries and gravy were cold. I asked the waitress to zap it for me, and she came back with a \"fresh one\", which was not much warmer. The sangria was good though."}
{"text":"Apparently, poutine is a Canadian staple. My friends and I were visiting Canada and wanted to experience it the right way; considering this place pretty much exclusively sells poutine we figured it would be the best spot to try it out.  Regrettably, it wasn't my cup of tea. I didn't like the sauce nor the cheese. I was assured by three different people on the staff that the sauce (normally gravy in the US) was vegetarian, but I still had my suspicions. I would've been better off just getting a basket of plain fries.  The worst part was the service was super slow and disorganized. The interior was pretty expansive and reminded me of an old wooden pub.   I love French fries with a passion but I guess poutine just isn't my thing. Sorry, Canada!"}
{"text":"Our first time trying Poutine - we ordered the regular and the smoked meat. Both were fantastic! The stone courtyard is lovely. The staff were also very nice."}
{"text":"location:  nestled in a neighborhood with cobblestone roads in between gotham buildings.  it felt like i was in europe.  street signs all written in french.  pleasant patio seating to soak in the environment (though it was during summer,  so it was bloody hot,  and i was perspiring like mad).  also,  fun to people watch.      must have item:    -smoked meat poutine:  so amazing.  so delicious.  so rich.   so filling.  the portions are pretty huge.  they pack on the smoked meat (rolled into little circles,  looked like mini meatballs),  squeaky cheese curds,  rich gravy,  and thick cut fries.  easily equals a day's worth of calories.  i was starving after having landed from the airport and hadn't eaten all day.  i ate everything and polished off that baby like it was nobody's business.  it was one of those don't-talk-to-me-i'm-eating moments.     conclusion:  european environment.  get the smoked meat poutine and sit outside on the patio.  just don't sit facing the sun.  you can definitely share it with someone,  but you're not going to want to.  indulge in this classic canadian staple.  you can get the plain poutine,  but it's better topped with another canadian classic,  smoked meat.  you can kill two canadian birds with one stone.  make yourself efficient."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am, in fact, a tourist writing a review for a tourist trap.  I typically eschew spots like this while travelling, but I had to cave this time. We had a game plan. We COULD and WOULD leave Old Montreal and grab lunch somewhere the locals ate...  Fail.  We passed this place with it's amazing patio on a cobblestone street full of flowers and artists selling their pieces, cold beers glimmering at us, delicious poutine wafting it's beckoning scent at us. UGH. FINE. WE'LL EAT HERE.  No regrets.  We got the poutine with \"smoked meat\" because even though it was vague, it still sounded delicious. It was great, and so filling we were full after splitting it between the two of us. I'm probably going to be dreaming of that gravy for a few more weeks...  Also, good beer selection! All Canadian brews.  And service, as it was everywhere in Montreal, was great. As usual, after their French greeting was met with \"Uhhhh...\" they instantly switched to perfect English with cute little accents that left us feeling like dumb Americans.  I recommend it as a place to stop in for a pint and poutine after a morning of wandering Old Montreal. We had a great experience. Plus, it really wasn't all that touristy. Everyone else there was at least Québécois. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"They ran out of poutine sandwiches on a Sunday!  Seriously??  The pizza smoked meat was okay. My brother and sister both got the poutine smoked meat. My brother's had more meat in it so his was way better. The poutine was beyond okay.  The gravy and cheese were great. I think it would be better to have it as an appetizer instead of the main course. Overall, we weren't very satisfied with our food. There's a pretty decent creperie upstairs though. I don't know if the owner is the same."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was beautiful outside and located right in old Montreal . However, when we went it was a very cold day. The inside was completely empty and looked abandoned. The poutine was ok, mediocre if I'm being honest. The sangria was not great either and quite frankly overpriced. If I'm back in Montreal I probably would only go here on a hot summer day for the decor outside."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Montreal and I had to find some authentic Poutine.  A quick check on Yelp and we were on our way here.  While they have a small outdoor area in back, with snow coming down we headed upstairs to grab a seat inside.  It's located in an old building it feels old with its short doorways and exposed stone and brick walls.  We were seated quickly and all decided on Poutine of some sort.  I washed it. Down with a local craft beer as well.  I opted for the poutine with spicy sausage and it was delicious!  The gravy was hot and flavorful, the curds delicious and the sausage had just enough kick to make it interesting.  Honestly I ate too much as it was so rich and good.  Nothing really fancy here, just some good beer and legit poutine.  Next trip to Montreal will include a repeat at this place."}
{"text":"Service was great. Come on it's poutine!!!  Our waiter was really nice. Definitely coming back.  Can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"It was my first time here to try poutine. Very tasty smoked meat poutine and sangria. The service was friendly and the ambience was cozy because we sat a patio that warmed up."}
{"text":"They have vegetarian poutine, which is arguably healthier than it's artery-clogging cousin. This is a nice place to sit outside and enjoy some fries covered in cheese and gravy. It's cheap, fast and friendly and the menu is in English."}
{"text":"Poutine was a little pricy for what it was and they do t offer tap water, had to buy bottled. The chicken poutine was delicious but the smoked meat wasn't as good."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Delicious poutine. Very chill atmosphere with great service. Can hang here for hours."}
{"text":"très jolie terrasse   Poutine pas mauvaise (j'ai choisi la classique, mais la sauce n'était pas vraiment exceptionnelle)  Je pensais pouvoir prendre une fin du monde avec ça mais ils n'avaient que de la blanche de Chambly, pas de possibilité d'avoir une carafe d'eau, il faut payer pour une bouteille (really ?)  Il y a tellement d'autres endroits pour manger une meilleure poutine, mais ... Très jolie terrasse (ils ont au moins ça)"}
{"text":"Tourist trap. it was cold and I came here. Its not great, but not terrible.   Bottle of water was $2.50, but they offered 2 bottles for price of one. Then when we got the bill we had to walk over to the terminal to pay, while people around us were paying at their tables... Super sketch."}
{"text":"This place was basically just an outdoor venue inside a courtyard after the hostess shows you in. It has a very nice outside ambience while the weather is still good and it is still somewhat bearable to be outside on a random monday evening. very casual vibe with nice polite staff. I wanted wine but they only had sangria and unibroue. very tasty chicken poutine."}
{"text":"My party ordered poutine and smoked meat, and it was very tasty. It's not as amazing as I was expecting genuine Montreal poutine to be, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. One minor complaint is that my entree didn't come with the advertised pickle, but I managed to survive.  The much larger problem I had with this restaurant is that the waiter gave a guilt-trip sob story about tips at the end of the meal. My bill was for $37, and I gave the waiter $40, expecting change. He started to tell me about how if they don't receive a large enough tip, they get taxed on it or some silly bullshit. I proceeded to tell him that I had intended to leave the actual tip on the table, which is what I always do, and I think that's fairly standard. He then said the exact same thing to our table mates.  Begging for tips, regardless of how much customers decide to tip, is NEVER okay. This needs to stop. It made my party and I extremely uncomfortable. It appears that I'm not the only reviewer who had an experience like this.  On a final note, service was a little slow. We witnessed one table leave before being served after they'd waited long enough.  Update: I complained about our waiter after our trip, but never received a response. That sort of behaviour cannot be excused. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Beau décor, service lent, poutine petite pour 12,50$ (smoked meat), bouteille d'eau Eska à 3$ (une farce), c'est une attrape touriste. Pas de menu enfant. Sandwich viande fumée tres petite...alors un bofff"}
{"text":"Attention : trappe à touristes !   Je sais, ça commence raide, mais que voulez vous ? Mon amour de notre mets national (poutine) me pousse à dénoncer ce genre d'endroit. Située dans le vieux Montréal, cette poutinerie est bien placée pour attirer les touristes internationaux qui visitent notre chère métropole. Premier indice qu'il s'agit d'une trappe à touriste ? On ne sert pas de verre d'eau chez Montréal Poutine. Vous devez acheter une bouteille d'eau Dasani à 3$ pour vous hydrater. On vend aussi des t-shirt. Soupire...  En jetant un il au menu, on se surprend de n'y voir que 6 sortes différentes de poutine. Ici, rien d'exceptionnel ou de très recherché. Montréal Poutine vous sert ce qu'on peut vous servir partout ailleurs : régulière (étrangement appelé végétarienne), saucisse, poulet, italienne, bacon et smoke meat. Rien de nouveau. Alors, pour 10,50$ j'ai choisi la poutine au poulet mariné (qu'on avait dû oublier de mariner...). Pour le prix, la portion est petite. La qualité est correcte, sans plus. Le service est rapide et les serveurs sympathiques. Jolie terrasse à l'arrière. Excellent choix de bières québécoises.   Conclusion : vous êtes un touriste et vous désirez découvrir la poutine ? Allez chez Montréal Poutine si le temps vous manque. Sinon, quittez le vieux Montréal qui regorge de ces restos « trappe à touristes ». Enfoncez-vous au cur de notre belle ville et rendez vous chez Poutineville, La Banquise ou chez Lafleur pour vraiment gouter de ce met national hors du commun."}
{"text":"Had to try Poutines while in Montreal and this place did not disappoint. Fun place, kinda crowded, no bar area, and a small wait to get inside on a normal afternoon. Great beer list, and looks like a nice patio area when the weather is nice. I would recommend."}
{"text":"A very interesting experience with poutine. Being vegetarian, my mom was on the hunt and wanted to try poutine. Unfortunately, this wasn't the experience we had. The dish itself was basically French fries in a soy sauce with pieces of mozzarella cheese- not sure if this is what it should be like but not our favorite.   Slightly more unfortunate was that we waited more than 30 minutes for one order of fries.   Not sure if this was just our experience or if we just had different expectations but not our favorite.  EDIT: after trying poutine at another place, we have come to the realization that the dish at this place was fine- just not for us. Almost the same as another place. Have changed from 2 star to 3."}
{"text":"Our first time trying poutine and it was delicious!! My husband and I chose the smoked meat. We also ordered the Caesar salad, which wasn't a very traditional Caesar but very good, and decided to share the 2 between us. Definitely enough food for a quick bite to eat on the go. The only thing was \"because it was raining\" there was no liquor being served. The sangria was great tho and my husband enjoyed his beer."}
{"text":"Don't leave with stopping at Montreal Poutine! A favorite Canadian staple and its so good!  Nice location just steps fr Place Jacques Cartier. Take the Orange Line to Champ-De-Mars."}
{"text":"I know this is in a tourist location, but we stayed in Old Port right around the corner and needed to get a fix.    It was a beautiful day out, so we sat in the back terrace which was actually quite nice.  We enjoyed a traditional poutine and a glass of beer, and have no complaints.  If you're in the area, I'd highly recommend it, especially if you haven't tried poutine before."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, but tasty nonetheless.  This is essentially french fries with cheese, gravy and some kind of meat topped on top of it.  If you're craving something savory or salty--this is it.   I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  Definitely try and do your bathroom business before coming here though--bathroom is hideously gross!!"}
{"text":"A crappy, overpriced definition of a tourist trap. Even on a blustery cold Saturday afternoon, the owner was still shepherding street walkers inside like a man with a two-headed dragon behind a curtain.  $9 gets you a smoked meat sandwich that'll have you thinking you took a growth elixir, so small and bite-size, as in two bites per half, it be. $8.50 brings forth not avocado fries, but one half of an avocado cut to the size of small bananas and dipped in breadcrumbs. A shame since the breading and sauce would be great were there not so much avocado.  I'm glad I had a LivingSocial coupon on my person, my only reason for going in the first place, but even with it the cost was far too high. The whole place would deserve no more than one star, were it not for the fact that it was clean and not unsanitary in any way.  Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy the company of twenty mindless tourists all chowing down on what they think poutine should taste like, and head to La Banquise instead to get the real deal."}
{"text":"I am in Montreal from California visiting a local. We're staying in a hostel close to Montreal Poutine and wanted to get something to eat that was close, we were hungry and we thought we'd give this place a try. Bad idea.   The man, who I assume is the owner, pressured us to come into this tourist trap. This crazy guy was chasing people around the street, LEAVING his restaurant, and saying \"Bonjour! Bonjour!\" and \"Monsieur! Monsieur!\" to people, FLAGGING them down to come into his restaurant. I felt so embarassed for him. He obviously had no shame, and good for him! However, I would be a little hesitant to beg people to come into a restaurant that was not going to impress people in the least. He was quite obnoxious and I was rather turned off by his pushy attitude.  We were given a seat outside, and within about 10 minutes we were visited by our server, who I almost ignored because he was wearing an \"I love poutine\" shirt, and approached us from OUTSIDE of the fenced dining area. To be honest at first I thought he was a complete stranger. We ask for a diet coke, and a regular coke.  The server returns shortly with two drinks, with 2 or 3 disintegrating ice cubes floating on the top, and proceeds to tell us he forgot which drink was which, and left us to figure it out. Let me paint the scenery a bit for you. Small porch. 5-8 people on the whole patio, and TWO at our table. Did he really forget which drink was which between the time he walked from the kitchen to our table? They were extremely flat by the way, and tasted like they had been poured a long time ago and left to sit until someone ordered them. I have never even heard of something so absurd. The local ordered a burger and I ordered a smoked meat sandwhich. The food was okay, but the smoked meat was not at all what it is supposed to be. Our server never returned to ask us how we were, if we needed anything, or if he could refill our flat, disgusting sodas. Oh! By the way, don't expect free water. You get a bottle and its $2.50. He thinks. He didn't quite seem to know. The bill comes and we want to pay with a card, so we go inside and obviously we're not impressed by what we've experienced, and didn't want to give the average 15% tip. My friend asks to put 13% instead, since the guy isn't letting him hold the machine himself, and the server is practically in shock. He says that %15 is standard, and they don't go below that. Ummm, excuse me, I know that 15% is \"standard\" and \"polite\" but as far as I know, a tip is a tip, a tip because you DID YOUR JOB WELL! Why should I give you extra mpney if you can't even meet basic performance standards?! He then asked my friend if he was from Canada, as if he was stupid and didn't know how much to tip in a restaurant. My friend says \"Yes, I'm from Montreal!\" and ends up having to give the guy the %15 because obviously he's not budging.   Montreal is a beautiful city, and words can't even describe how wonderful Old Montreal is. I have had nothing but delicious food and amazing service since I've been here, but I can safely say that even outside this city, Montreal Poutine was probably some of the worst restaurant service I have ever experienced, and their food was barely mediocre."}
{"text":"Great options for poutine. We had the smoked meat and Italian sausage and it was a lot of food for 2! To pair with that, the Fin du Monde beer is strong but a great combination! Nice ambient and the waitress was very fun and nive"}
{"text":"So we never had poutine before and knew we had to try it while in Montreal. This place was not too far from our hotel. We ordered the poutine with smoked meat to share (it was an afternoon snack for us). Fries with the sauce and meat were pretty good, but (I'm sorry to say) we weren't digging the cheese curds. In fact, we left most of them on the plate! I'm sure that we insulted someone by doing so but it just wasn't for us. Service is also just ok."}
{"text":"What's up with the bad reviews!? This place makes some good Poutine and smoked meat sandwich! The beer is cold, the food is great and the waiters are nice! What is there to complain about! Really good place!"}
{"text":"We went here to try their smoked meat, but at the same time we wanted to try the poutine. Our server was really not attentive at all. There was bird poop on the table, which he hadn't noticed. When we mentioned it to him, he didn't even apologize. He made it seem like we were a bother by asking him to clean it. When we said we didn't want to purchase an alcoholic drink, we were not even offered water. He didn't even come back after the meal was served to ask how things were. There was little to none interaction from the service end. We felt like we were a bother to them. He was more concerned about his man bun. I would say overall the service was lacking, like they didn't care.   I would not come back for that reason.   As for the food. It's nothing special. The poutine was average, nothing special for poutine. The portion was big though. The smoked meat sandwich was tiny, the meat tasted processed, not like a clean piece of meat. It was quite pricey for a small portion.   If the service was minimal, we might come back, but it was little to none."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great food, very charming atmosphere. The poutine was great and there are veggie options! Definitely go for the peach juice too!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Canada before but was in Toronto and was told to only eat poutine in Montreal. So naturally with the amount of poutineries there was on the market I was a bit overwhelmed. I tried the one with the least annoying name and the cheaper prices.  Considering I didn't know what to expect I am surprised that I enjoyed my choice. Had smoked meat poutine and found it amazing. Why am I not eating this all the time in the States? This needs to catch on.  The staff was attentive and extremely helpful in helping, me choose what to order."}
{"text":"Walking upon Rue St. for hours, my sister and I were growing hungry and since Houston (our 2nd hometown) lacks this delicious dish, we decided to try Montreal Poutine. Being a Canadian and all, I have been a huge fan of poutine ever since I was a young gal. And being Canada and all, (our 1st hometown) I feel that each restaurant that decides to serve Poutine has to be top-of-the-line-legit-make-ya-slap-ya-momma-good. Sadly, this establishment failed to meet that. (I know who has the best poutine and so stay tuned!)  Service was wonderful. (The host complimented me on my attire... #pimpin) We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress stopped by and did not hesitate to ask us if we wanted an alcoholic beverage with our meal so I opted to get a glass of their Sangria. It was mediocre...just like the poutine I ordered which was with Italian sausage because I thought it was a bit too salty. The menu was not too pricey either which I think evens out!  The restaurant's ambiance is very relaxed. It reminded me of a very Austin-esque environment. We were seated outside and on a nice day, it is the perfect setting to sit and eat outdoors. The music was not too loud or too soft. Chatter amongst the customers was mildly comforting as it did not interfere with my own conversation with my sister. They also sell t-shirts and hoodies of their restaurant with a simple logo that says \"Montreal Poutine\" in the right top corner. It was $20 for the t-shirt and $30 for the hoodie, I believe.  Oh yeah, only one uni-sex restroom so beware."}
{"text":"While this is definitely a tourist trap of Old Montreal, it isn't bad! The entire block is the same -- but only the first door on the block has wifi available. They all have a cute outdoor area, and the tables get cleaned when they get to it. The price was a bit high, but the food was not bad. Also, if you do not order a drink, you get no water unless you've brought your own. Their coffee is swill -- bring your own water and then get coffee elsewhere.   If you are tired of walking around and want a cute spot to rest your tired dogs while eating something incredibly fatty, then this is not a bad spot to stop!"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere. BUT fries came out cold and pretty pricey for poutine almost 10$. Not the best I've had."}
{"text":"For some reason, with the name poutine in it, I was expecting better poutine. It was good, just not great in my opinion. They do have a wide variety and perhaps I didn't pick the best one, though I can't remember which one I picked anymore. Ah well."}
{"text":"An excellent representation of Montreal poutine, we had been looking for the perfect place to have the must have meal in Montreal. We were not disappointed it was hot and delicious the cheese curds were melty, and the gravy was of the thinner variety, I guess that's the big difference between this Montreal staple and all the other imposter throughout Ontario lol.   The atmosphere was very nice we were greeted by a very friendly hostess, his friendly-ness basically solidified the decision to eat there. We sat out on the patio and it was lovely, despite the extreme heat.      Would recommend to anyone looking for lunch on Rue Sainte Paul."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of old port, very nice outside back terrace that most people don't know about. Lots of tourist reviews on here but I went and didn't feel like it was a trap.  I got their poutine with chicken which was massive and worth the 10$ price because it did consist of a meal in itself and filled me up. It felt like I had an entire chicken breast that was shredded on top, very generous portion, I couldn't finish. If you only want poutine as a side, they do have grilled sandwhiches, hot dogs, pizzas and burgers available.  Their poutine is what people come for and it was very good although it's the kind of food that makes me sick if I eat too much of it. Their fries are thick cut, it's a very heavy meal."}
{"text":"If you're drunk (we weren't) this would be a good spot.  It was just so-so to us.  The prices are very high for what you get in quality and quantity.  They also do not serve tap water, you must pay if you want to wash down your grease."}
{"text":"Loved the poutine here! Came by with two friends while we were visiting Montreal for the weekend. Because it was January we were definitely in the mood for some hot and filling snacks! We opted to share two orders of poutine between the three of us: one regular and one smoked meat. Everything came out very quickly (though we were one of two parties in the restaurant at the time... I assume it's much busier in the summer months) and was piping hot upon delivery!  I loved the flavors of both dishes and they were different enough that trying multiple was definitely a good decision!  Service was fine enough, the women working seemed a little off in their own world, but were attentive whenever we did need anything. Would recommend for a local taste!"}
{"text":"Poutine clan ain't nothin to f*** with."}
{"text":"Tourist trap.  Poutine was overpriced and flavorless, skimpy on the cheese curds. Overpriced and disappointing. Try one of the many, many other restaurants in the Old Port area. Service was ok but .... you could do better."}
{"text":"Good poutine, good service but the outdoor patio could be cleaner. End of review haha.  But seriously everything was fine, and it's my 2nd time here. We wanted just a quick snack before dinner so split the regular poutine and it was a perfect amount.   The service was friendly enough and easy going. Prices were a little above average but this is the tourist old Montreal area haha.   All in all, 4 stars. 5 if they cleaned better maybe."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place.  Here are the lowlights:  1) The poutine was disgusting.  The cheese curds were ice cold and the braised pork was just ham and had big pieces of fat throughout. When we told the waiter it was cold, he took it upstairs and they just poured more, gross gravy on it.  After a few bites we couldn't continue.  The couple next to us had a similar experience with the \"Italian sausage\" that was basically just a hot dog.  The wife didn't even eat hers. 2) This place was really dirty.  When we walked in at first glance it didn't seem too bad but once we sat down and looked around for a few minutes we noticed the grime and filth all over.  The ceiling was leaking water and there wasn't even a bucket to catch the leak.  The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned ever and was totally disgusting.  3) The tiny hamburger was dwarfed by a giant bun. You could barely taste the burger, which was probably for the better because they only serve burgers well done. 4) I ordered the \"rouge\" ale which came warm.  I didn't want to complain about it until a different waitress told the couple next to us they weren't serving it because it was too warm because they just changed the keg.  She also said the dishwasher was broken so they didn't have clean glasses... My waiter let me drink warm beer from a dirty glass.  I hesitate to call this a positive but I feel it's only fair to mention that after we complained, they took my beer and the poutine off the bill.  Too little too late because our lunch and appetite for the day had already been ruined."}
{"text":"We had a delightful lunch on the outside terrace- great beer, sangria, and amazing smoked meat poutine. Really enjoyable atmosphere and our waiter was very kind and hospitable. It was perfect for what we were looking for."}
{"text":"This was our second poutine stop in our visit to Montreal. The fries were very close to Belgian fries, but there wasn't enough topping. I actually had to ask our waiter for extra gravy because there wasn't enough for all the fries. The prices are also steep which is expected since this is a touristy area. We absolutely loved our waiter--great attitude, very friendly, patient, and funny."}
{"text":"Good poutine, friendly staff. French fries, cheese curds, gravy. Yum yum. You know the drill. The other stuff is good, too."}
{"text":"Went there very late last night. Courtyard setting is absolutely beautiful and the food was tasty.  If you're looking for a bite to eat after a night of drinking this place is definitely a winner."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm poutine. If you like gravy, cheese and fries this is a solid stop in Montreal. A quick explanation on poutine: French fries smothered in gravy with chunks of cheese curd thrown in. Yum!  At this lovely establishment you can enjoy your poutine with bacon, smoked meat, hot dogs, and pulled pork. The smoked meat was a bit too cut up for my liking, but once I got passed the look of it it tasted great!   Can't comment much on the other food, but they have a 9% beer called \"end of the world\" which is pretty snazzy. It's highly recommended to enjoy with your poutine!"}
{"text":"A little pricy but well worth it. Amazing poutine and great big beers."}
{"text":"It's pretty much poutin all day, every day in MTL.  Happened by this place in time for an afternoon snack knowing we were having a late dinner. We somewhat randomly stopped in as the missus was having an achy foot issue and needed to sit down, and I had to take a call from the office, and we happened to be in front.   Fit for purpose, the poutin was good but a bit bland, the menu wasnt much more than poutin, and pricey for just that.  Kind of a cool rickety interior courtyard dining space, but most anywhere else in town has a better rendition of the dish.  By no means awful, just nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Excellent pouting, however a bit on the pricey side. Really big portions with gooey, chewy cheese curds, though. :)"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: I came here on a weekday evening. Super quiet, there was literally no one in the restaurant, it felt like a ghost town.    FOOD: I was beyond disappointed. Not only was the portion tiny, the \"fried chicken\" was basically just rotisserie chicken. Plus, it was dry and didn't taste fresh at all. I would NOT recommend this place and I will never come back here again.  PRICE: Overpriced for the portion and quality you're getting. So not worth the money and time. You can eat better and pay less at La Banquise.  SERVICE: The service was horrible too. Waiters are not attentive at all, not welcoming and just seem like they don't care. The staff just stayed on their phones and when we asked for water, they gave us water bottles which were another hidden 2$."}
{"text":"L'odeur qui émane des toilettes ici est vraiment dégueulasse. On était assis assez loin desdits petits coins, mais on sentait quand même la puanteur imprégnée dans la pièce pendant qu'on mangeait, surtout quand la porte des salles de bain s'ouvrait. La poutine est correct, pas plus, un peu fade même. Si tu veux boire un verre d'eau avec ton repas il faut acheter une bouteille (ils ne servent pas d'eau avec le repas et je trouve ça un peu cheap). Il y a de meilleures poutines ailleurs. Par contre, ils ont une poutine 100% végétarienne, chose qu'on ne trouve pas toujours ailleurs."}
{"text":"Big heaps of pub fried topped with onion beef gravy.......cheese curds and Montreal smoked corned beef.....wow!!  Beers are fantastic....blanc, blonde, or noir.......  Great prices, and amazing location in old Port."}
{"text":"This a an excellent place for poutine in a good and convenient location. The menu is small and concise. I got the spicy Italian sausage poutine and shared a beer with my other three friends. The prices here aren't super cheap, but I found that they were reasonable. We came in sort of late, at around 8 PM and noticed that there was very little lighting in the restaurant. Overall, this was an excellent restaurant that I would probably go back to."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Poutine were fabulous.  Crispy exterior, soft interior, flavorful but not overwhelming gravy with soft cheese curds.  Highly recommended as the go-to spot for poutine."}
{"text":"2 stars because of the ambiance and service as everything else was 0 stars. I ordered a ceasars salad and it was one of the worst I've had. So tasteless, bland. My daughter had the chicken burger which I had half and that too was horrid. Poutine was OK. Maybe I should have given a 3 star. It was also expensive for what we got. i guess the ambiance has to somehow get paid."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem that I stumbled across by chance. It is located on the second floor in a dimly lit, intimate room. The onion topped poutine and garden salad were excellent. The salad was fresh and is large enough to share for two. The poutine was the best I've had. I highly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here on Friday during a weekend trip to Montreal.  The patio area is really pleasant which is enclosed with stone walls and an open top.  The menu has various poutines and quebec beers. We tried the smoked meat poutine which was really good!  The beer (Unibroue) was good too.  The service however was just ok.  I would recommend this place, hopefully when better service is present."}
{"text":"Fun little view of the boutique and  across the street. If you want some crazy mixture of poutine youll be out of luck. But hey, their servings are pretty good and their poutines have just enough grease to make you full but not regret it."}
{"text":"wow. just wow. amazing poutine (potatoes they use are just so good). the ambiance is amazing. best part, the waiter Max. if you want to know what an amazing service feels like, make sure to ask for him."}
{"text":"If you love fries, cheese and gravy this location is a MUST.   Be prepared. You will leave stuffed!!"}
{"text":"Little place down in old Montreal with Fast service, amazing poutine and comfortable overall atmosphere. Definitely try the smoked meat poutine."}
{"text":"To no one' surprise, it's a total tourist trap! I mean, they sell tshirts for crying out loud. I must say that the poutine is quite tasty tho. The fries and cheese are fresh and the sauce is most likely not homemade (think brand name like St-Hubert sauce, something like that). They also have a nice selection of beer and a nice quiet patio in the back.  But how do you explain a 150$ bill for 7 people at a poutine joint? Also, don't bother requesting for water for drink. They only have bottled water... Right, and how do they wash their hands if they have no running water?  Overall a good meal but will head elsewhere if am craving poutine in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"I took my cousins (their first time in North America) for a Quebec experience. We picked the wrong place!   Service was very rude. Poutine was good (especially the one with smoked meat). We also had pizza (the thinnest crust I've ever experienced; not bad) and drinks.   When we went to divide the bill the waitress refused to give us change! I'm not cheap but for the customer service ... she did not deserve a 20% tip. She said she wasn't paid enough and that it was mandatory to tip. VERY BAD Canadian experience to show foreigners; I was quite embarrassed for them!"}
{"text":"This rugged sports bar type restaurant is located upstairs next to a souvenir shop. They offer many types of poutine and recommend the beer!   The fries came out a bit too soggy for my liking, the staff was friendly, and offers a nice view of the street."}
{"text":"Waitress was pleasant and attentive, drinks were generous pours and  ambiance was casual and laid back. We ordered a smoked meat sandwich with side of poutine, kids burger and kids hot dog. All the food was meh, and worth the money. Come here for a drink but skip the food."}
{"text":"Poutine tastes good but cheese was not squeaky. I would recommend you try out some other poutine places that actually have fresh cheese that's squeaky for the actual poutine experience."}
{"text":"I got a poutine to go here.  The poutine was super delicious and was really convenient. The place looked like more of a sit down place to eat, but the people were super nice and accommodating to get a poutine to go. The price was was not that bad either. The poutine was packed into a styrofoam box, and they did not skimp out on the melty cheese curds."}
{"text":"Being in the middle of the old Montréal section of town, amongst kitschy and souvenir shops I was hesitant to go in for fear of walking into a tourist trap; but I really wanted to try poutin since apparently it's the traditional local dish.  The ambiance was mellow; not very busy midweek; and the \"entertainment\" was an old boom box on a shelf in the corner.  Poutin is not for me, but I have nothing to compare it to and now I can say I've had fries with gravy and cheese curds at a place that's famous for it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I simply walked past this restaurant and the outdoor area beckoned us in. We just had to try this place out, even though we have no idea if the poutine and food here was good or not... Also, we were told that we HAD to try poutine when we were in Montréal. We were glad we stopped by here because we were greeted by a nice hostess, the service was great, and the burger and poutine we had was very satisfying! We didn't have poutine in any other places but we were fine with just trying Montréal Poutine. Although there may be better places, I say why not give this place a try? Plus, sitting in the outdoor space is really cool - my favorite part of the experience!"}
