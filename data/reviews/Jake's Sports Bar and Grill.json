{"text":"Fun bar, fun people, cold beer...LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Ugly little troll behind the bar named Stacy that has a speech impediment shorted me on my change when I called her out about it she pulled it back out of her tip jar and returned it. Beware I'm sure this want the first time. When I told her she shorted me $2.50 she got a huge attitude. As I was walking to my table one of the customers that I assume was a regular told me it happens all the time to watch my money around her. Are the owners aware of this or in on it. BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and priced fairly.  The Wednesday wing special is better than any wing night out there.  They have over 10 sauces and dry rubs.  All kinds of drink specials except my Bacardi.  The owner is a sweetheart, the cook is a big teddy bear and the morning bartender is your man when it comes to sports information.  The afternoon bartender is a saucy red-head that will rip you to shreds with her wit AND you will laugh your butt off through-out.  It is more a corner bar than anything else, but all in all it is a fun place to hang whether you are in the industry, a suit, a biker or a regular Joe."}
{"text":"I moved in the area a few months ago and needed a watering hole for after work close to my house.  I would go by this place for a month until I finally stopped in.  I love the crowd, the staff, and the affordable prices.  I went for Tuesday tacos, 08/04/15, and they were cheap and delicious.  I was missing cheese on my taco, but she was cooking, bussing, running the cash drawer, bartender, entertainer, and so attentive to her guests that I didn't even notice till she mentioned it and apologized.  I will definitely be back soon! Thanks Daphine for the smile and great attitude!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever received ever. SHANNON the bartender was very disrespectful."}
{"text":"We were driving east one cactus road on Sunday morning and just crossed cave creek road and saw a small sigh on the side of the road for a \"free Sunday Breakfast\".  We still decided to stop a and have a bit to eat. We arrived at Jake's Sports bar It was a very nice clean bar and plenty of seating. We asked the an older gentleman we assumed he was the owner and asked about the breakfast special that was on the sign out front of the establishment. He stated the breakfast is closed and we have to order lunch instead, we still agreed an ordered lunch instead it took over an hour and still have no meals, We asked the owner what is taking so long and he stated   We were not ready for lunch and had to put all the breakfast away and the fryers were not ready for lunch. We asked if we can go next store and order a sandwich and wait for our food and he said he would have  a problem with that. By the time we got our food it was raw and he made us pay us pay for it before we can see it. We decided  not to give him a Tip and he got angry?  We are the ones who were screwed.  I don't think there is a free breakfast there, its just a way to fill seats in a bar.  Don't go there!  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Your typical bar in a strip mall... waitress was very attentive to all her customers and drinks were affordable. I can see how this would be a nice local hangout."}
{"text":"I went to this place last Friday and couldn't believe it. The place has been completely renovated. They now have a great menu with all kinds of fresh food that bars usually don't even try to make. Wings were great, cheeseburger even better. The bar keeps were friendly and fast. The place was crowded with karaoke patrons and everyone seemed to be having a great time. I'm gonna go back again tonight to see if it's just as fun"}
{"text":"The game was on and the place wAs filled with regulars. Heavy metal was playing on the jukebox and you could here laughter. A pool table had some players racking them up. This is a fun and divey spot for a afternoon beer on a Saturday. The bartender came out before we even fully sat down to get our drink order. They have Stella on tap and the glasses to go with it."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night (about midnight, maybe later).  The bar is in a strip mall just west of Quik Trip.  The atmosphere is nice, typical of most neighborhood bars.  The bar is named after a German Shepherd named Jake.  Love that!    Our bartender Shannon was awesome!  She kept the drinks flowing and was so nice to boot.  I liked that I could get food late at night at a bar.  Most bars close their kitchen down but our bartender was happy to cook us up some grub.  She made the best Parmesan Garlic wings I have ever had.  These aren't the sauced kind.  These are kind with actual Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top, deep fried and crispy.  Best bar wings I have ever had.  We also had the cheese sticks.  Yummy too.   We loved this bar and highly recommend it."}
