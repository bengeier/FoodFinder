{"text":"I feel like I've been going there for years. I meet amazing people every time I go. Great food and great coffee!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of meeting Gabriel at a bar where he used to work and we loved his customer service. When he told us he was leaving because he was opening a coffee shop, we definitely wanted to check it out. Trans Am Phx has excellent space, art, natural light, great coffee, smoothies, and even pressed ginger! This was everything I needed to get some work done. I'll definitely be going back!   Be sure to try the pressed ginger"}
{"text":"One of the coolest coffee shops in Phx. A little off the beaten bath but worth the trip. Had an ice coffee with homemade walnut milk. Bomb! A great place to chill, read, study, hang out. Highly recommended 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty cool new cafe/coffee shop. Nice look about the place, great $2 cup of coffee and occasional live music"}
{"text":"Trans Am Cafe is the BEST place for coffee in all of Arizona. I love this place and I come here everyday while I am visiting family in Phoenix. I really wish we had a fabulous third wave coffee shop like this in my city! I love the artwork, (on occasion) the live music, the overall atmosphere, the friendly and laid-back approach to customer service (thank you Brad and Gabriel) and of course, the many, many, many wonderful vegan and vegetarian options to choose from! Have you ever had fresh walnut milk in your coffee? No?! Neither had I before my first visit here. It will blow your mind! This is a wonderful place to come with a book, center your chi and just zen. Yes, my friend, if you have not yet visited Trans Am, then you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Hip, ecclectic cafe open mornings and late Friday night. Laid back environment with a very cool selection of house art and a rotating local wall. Sad to see Trunk Space go, but if it had to go, glad this place showed up to fill the space beautifully."}
