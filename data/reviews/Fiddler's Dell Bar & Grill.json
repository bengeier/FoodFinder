{"text":"The Dell seems to be underrated by other reviewers, or maybe it's changed recently? Went here for the first time yesterday after having passed by it for years in the neighborhood and was very pleasantly surprised!   What pulled me in was their signage claiming 20 beers on tap, and knowing that as a bar with euro origins (Slovak, I think) they probably had great European taps that were fresh. Couldn't be more right! Was looking for a redux of some of the beers and meals I had in Bratislava and Prague this summer and they nailed it!!  I started with a delicious Pilsner Urquell and it was poured the proper way with a good head and in the right glass.  Followed that with some wiener schnitzel which was delicious although slightly off-traditional as it was served with rice instead of potato. Very close to what grandma used to make to be honest! Food was served hot and quickly, and the portion was very generous.  To top it all off, the service was excellent! To be fair, the server had to move very quickly to cover the number of tables she had on the go but it worked and she got it done with style and while still managing to be engaging at each table.  So why not 5-star? I would reserve that rating until later, or something repeatabley excellent (don't have enough experience yet) or perhaps with a bit more polish, and with more servers. I don't want you, dear reader, to confuse this with someplace all-singing, all-dancing, but sometimes you don't want 5-star, and you don't want a corp bar with factory service. In that mission I think the Dell is very successful - don't hesitate to try it out! And if you do, I highly recommend you eat and drink European. Real deal stuff here not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda surprised that i'm the first to write a review of \"The Dell\". I mean, On Cue has reviews even. But what can be said about the Dell? I have an affection for this place that, on a week night, is a bit like the polish version of Cheers.  It's one of those places that is charming in it's own, run-down, sad decor, same crew of people telling the same stories kind of ways. But the bar flies that keep it in business are colourful, friendly and mostly funny. The owner, Joe, is a very kind guy. And the waitresses are a rad group of ladies that always make you feel welcome (they'll remember your drink even weeks later). Kitchen does a range of food but stick to the specials or the perogies. My rating is low because the place is what it is and if you're looking for something young and hip, well, this ain't it. But, it's certainly got character(s)."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst bar I have ever been in. It is close to home so is used once or twice a year. They always short change on drinks. Today they excelled - I ordered a pint and got three quarters of a pint. I complained to the barmaid who was not pleased - she did top up the beer though. I had steak and asked if it would be possible to change the fries to mash - sure said the waitress, no problem. They charged $4 for the change....... A few months ago my wife and I decide to call in for a couple of Martinis. We were given a tiny amount in a Martini glass which tasted disgusting.   I will never go back there - be warned, this place is a rip off."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is that it's the only pub in the area. It's really too bad because with a few simple upgrades/changes, it could be awesome. We live steps away so have been here many times, but only because it's the only place in the hood to drop into for a quick drink.   Burgers are frozen and from a box, caesar salad dressing is Kraft, club sandwich is made with processed turkey and cheese. For kids, I'd recommend the chicken fingers which are made of ample white meat (though probably from a box). I had breakfast here a few times and it was perfectly fine in a greasy spoon kind of way.   It's too bad the owners don't put a bit more love into their food... would make all the difference.   Reviewer Jenny S below says it all. Dated decor and mediocre food, but there's beer!"}
{"text":"Perfect food, perfect beer and a very kind owner. Everything you need for a perfect evening. + if u are from Slovakia they have borovi?ka so come ! You wont regret! We are definitely coming  back !"}
{"text":"We've lived in the area for almost 10 years now and I keep by passing the Dell.  Finally got in for a drink with some friends and I have to say, it's not bad.  We didn't get any food as we had eaten dinner already.  I hear that the goulash is the menu item to get.  Decent draft selection - I went with a Mill St. Organic ($6.50).  Chill bar with a bit of an old school/divey feel.  It's a lot closer to our house than the regular standbys on Bloor West or in the Junction.  Could be a good place to grab a drink if you're wait listed at nearby Queen Margarita Pizza?  We'll be back to try that goulash."}
