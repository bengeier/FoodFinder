{"text":"I love the sweet and sour combo the food is fresh and hot. Great place to go each lunch, they are fast and courteously. They are clean and friendly I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Okay, so I might be a total weirdo, but I wake up craving Pei Wei's fried rice some days.  There is very little I enjoy more than waking up hungry at 10 AM on one of my days off, logging on to Pei Wei's website, and ordering fried rice just the way I like it without having to explain it to anyone and risk them writing it down wrong.  I'm antisocial, so what?  Then, I know that when they open at 11 AM they will have my very special order of fried rice hot and ready waiting for me.  The portions are huge, so a $6-$7 order of fried rice can last me up to four meals, which is an awesome [if not exactly healthy] deal.  

I don't really like much of their other food that I've tried.  There's some sort of curry dish that was nice, but I'm sticking to my fried rice with extra egg...  yum."}
{"text":"They argued with me again as to Wethersfield or not there was broccoli in the dish I asked for none and it's in it! I thought it was just two pieces but it's loaded with it I sent it back good thing I didn't do take out! I don't think I will be back sad! Now they gave me chicken instead of shrimp that I  paid for! And he is complaining!  Give me my money back. Well I was in my car and the manager came out to apologize and give me a gift card.  Unfortunately he is the same person who argued with me and blamed everything on the cashier! I told him that this has happened before and last time it was take out. Don't think I'll be back at least to this one."}
{"text":"This location used to be good.  It's gone down hill fast.  Last few times I've visited the service was extremely slow, the cashier's were rude and on my latest visit she charged me for a large plate when I ordered a small.  The manger was unfriendly when I tried to engage with him and why is it always freeeeezing in there.  Clearly Gambo hasn't been to this Pei Wei.  Never again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pei Wei but tonight I ordered a salad & a children's meal over the phone at 6:03 & I literally didn't have my salad in hand until 7:04... The place was crazy busy and everyone seemed so frazzled! It seems that when you cant get anyone's attention, they are most likely understaffed..  
While waiting outside with my son for about 30 minutes I learned from another angry guest waiting that they had a coupon out that expires today.. Cool, I get it, but please staff accordingly at times like this.. A lot of people seemed very very frustrated and if they hadn't already paid, people talked about how they would've just left (I may have too considering I order take out because I have a two year old & it is usually more convenient, but in this case I waited over 30 minutes after it should have already been done)..
I love your place, so Im just trying to give management some feedback on how the night was tonight."}
{"text":"1 star for flavor.  Food was acceptable, when we received it.  If you want to get served quickly, or want an inexpensive lunch STAY AWAY.  Eventually these folks will figure out a lunch service and then the young people crowding this place will probably keep coming back.  For a middle-aged professional who doesn't care about the cool new place - I'll skip it.  So many places give you food faster, for less money, with good flavor.  
Details: me and a buddy went here for lunch today, I ordered the Dan Dan noodles with chicken.  My friend ordered a single egg roll and the spicy peanut thing.  It took us 10 minutes to get to the counter to make that simple order.  Then we sat down and waited.  And waited. 40 MINUTES LATER the egg roll comes after the a cook came out from the back to try to figure out the distribution mess in front of house.  My friend shared the egg roll because we were starving and he is nice - it was luke warm but had good flavor.  7 minutes after that our food comes, literally 47 minutes after I ordered.  I checked the receipt.  We were within a minute of going up for refunds.
My dish had sprouts, noodles and chicken.  The ends of the sprouts still had dirt on them, not a lot but they didn't look properly rinsed, like the cooks were rushed??  Or not enough prep time in the morning.  The chicken on this dish is ground chicken, like hamburger, and there were chewy bits like ground up joints or gristle - not edible anyway.  I left 2/3 of the chicken on the plate. My friend's chicken was larger pieces that looked better cooked.  All this for 12.40 including a medium fountain drink.  Really?  I'll go to Farley's where you get a great pizza and drink for 9 (lunch special), or House of Leung where you get good flavor under 7 and table service.  Or jeez, go to Salsarita's, or Zapata's.  Zapata's is great and you get chips & salsa, right in the same plaza. Boardwalk Billy's or Showmar's - also better values."}
{"text":"Food was incredibly fresh! Service was excellent even though we stopped in on a holiday night . Management took the time to personally explain menu options to us and check on us after our food arrived. Thank you Ron, what a fun expected Friday night at Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"Terrible overly salty food and overpriced.  I paid $10 for inedible kung Pao when I could have spend the same money at panda express and gotten 3 different entrees that are much more consistent in flavor.  If you are looking for a fast cheap meal, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"3rd visit they told me my card had no money left. I was pretty sure it did but didn't want to put up a fuss, I left the card with the cashier. I got in my car and then decided to go back in. I told him I knew I did and he tried to swipe and run the card manually. It still came back to zero. I called the number on the card. They fixed it. She talked to the cashier and handled it. 
It would have been nice if he tried to help more.  
2nd visit. The wait was longer than the 1st. Some how they mixed up my order. Eh
(Update) my taste buds enjoyed but my stomach - not so much.. Could just be me though.
1st visit  Lo-mein /small= very tasty. Better after adding the spy sauce. The chicken is perfect. Veggies are fine. Portion is good

Potstickers = tasty but a $1 per potsticker is a bit much for their size. 

Service = not a single issue. Very fast. Went in at noon. Friendly staff. 

Would go again - not really. Maybe if friends were going."}
{"text":"We love Pei Wei! The food always is fresh and the whole family gets something they love and at a great price too!!! Thanks to the employees at the Dysart location to always treating us nice!"}
{"text":"I frequently order takeout from this location and for the last two orders after I got home I found the orders to be incorrect or missing some items. Last time I drove back and manager Kevin gave me a gift card for the error.

Today I got home and found a chicken fried rice instead of the shrimp that I had ordered & got charged for...VERY frustrating. If you order takeout from this location  double check your order before you leave the restaurant!"}
{"text":"always good food, wait time is always short reguardless of how busy they are."}
{"text":"Very good, consistent, reasonably priced food.  Great for take out.  Easy to call ahead and pick up when ready.

Some dishes I find a little salty but overall flavorful and some interesting combinations. 

Favorites are PeiWei spicy chicken (salad too), Dan Dan noodles, lettuce wraps, crab rangoons.  Think the Kung Pao is salty but flavorful. 

Fun to sit at the counter with your kids and feel the heat from the flames when the cooks are using the woks!"}
{"text":"Moved to the area, hadn't had Pei Wei in a while so I decided to try this location. Not at all how I used to remember Pei Wei food. Maybe it's just this location, but the food has been terrible. I've always loved the lettuce wraps, but the last two times I've ordered it, the lettuce I've been given has been the very inside of a head of lettuce-that nobody eats. You know, the small, yellow, wrinkly parts. It was impossible to make a wrap out of it, so I had to throw it in a bowl and make a salad. Which defeats the whole purpose of a lettuce wrap? My last order was Pad Thai, and the broccoli was limp and the florettes were yellow. Like the broccoli was old and should've just been thrown out. I've only had take out, so I can't comment too much on the service. One time when picking up my takeout, I watched a young gentleman with longer hair checking people out. I noticed he kept running his hands through his hair constantly. Which my first thought was, unsanitary! You work in a restaurant. But then figured it was okay since he was only handling money. But then I saw him go over and finish food orders, like add sesame seeds and whatever special little things they do at that counter. Grossed me out."}
{"text":"Pei Wei will always hold a special place in my heart. All I get is the Steak Low Mein but I have tried their lettuce wraps which are fantastic. The last couple times I ordered a pick up the lady working there (wish I could remember her name) was extremely polite and seemed very eager to be working there. The food is delicious and I would reccomend it to anyone wanting to try a good Chinese food place. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"1. Very dyslexic folk, can't read the order right if their life depended on it.
2. Special requests: Requested extra sauce on the side did not get any, requested extra spice guess that was forgotten as well.
3. Ordered tofu and vegetables( extra protein) got chicken \"complimentary\"
4. Ordered edamame , but you got to bring your own salt.

I choose to believe that you ought to be high before you have that many screw ups on one freaking order.

Of course this is not all Peiwei, it's the peiwei on Gilbert rd and warner rd in Gilbert AZ"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 1.5 stars. Nothing special. Lack of flavor. The entrees were either sweet or spicy. The crab Rangoon were.....different. The filling had a mealy consistency. Friend rice was bland. Plenty of other places to spend 50$ on takeout. Save your money."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei, but every time I go to this location my food is over cooked. In addition, the staff is rude. I will definitely not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This review is easy. Short and simple, because Pei Wei never disappoints. Quick and friendly service, great food (always prepared correctly), and low(ish) prices. I live nearby and I know that I can always depend on Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Poor service. Cashier gave me wrong change. Totally stole my money. Manager was as bad as the cashier."}
{"text":"Went here with friends and have been to other locations. This location was different than the rest though.the food came out overlooked to the point of tasting burned. Was not impressed."}
{"text":"First time to eat at a Pei Wei as was in town on a business trip.  This was quick food and very good!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for lunch. This place has many great lunch choices with reasonable prices. I love their choice of healthy teas. The workers are helpful and friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some Chinese food one evening, and really didn't feel like hiting Panda Express again (although in hindsight, it would have been a better choice.)

We had tried a Pei Wei in San Antonio in the fall of 2012. I wasn't overly impressed then, but thought we'd give it another shot. We were over on the west side of town geocaching and this one was close to where we finished for the day.

We came in on an early Friday afternoon and the place wasn't very busy so we thought we'd be able to grab a quick meal with some decent service. We placed our order for two steak lo mein dinners with a side of pork rolls. We sat down and waited...and waited...and waited while our food sat dying on the pass. Finally the three busboy/waiters came in from their smoke break on the patio. They brought Brenda's food over and then the pork rolls. We asked about my dinner and said that was it. We pulled out the receipt and sure enough, even though the cashier repeated back that we ordered 2 lo meins, he only rang us up for one. Since I already had a bad taste in my mouth from our last visit to a Pei Wei, I declined to go up and order again.

I tried the pork rolls and they were so greasy the mustard wouldn't even stick to them. I tasted Brenda's lo mein and the noodles really didn't have much flavor at all. I suppose that having the food sit at the pass under a heat lamp for 15 minutes while the server was on his smoke break didn't help much. This place is really disorganized. While we were there, we watched a table of 4 get served. Three of the four people got their food while the fourth got served only after a 10 minute wait and finally complaining to the staff.

When the waiter came around to ask how our food was, he only asked me (the person who didn't have food in front of him). He ignored Brenda completely. Zero stars is way to high of a rating for this place. We could have had a much better meal at Panda Express at a better price with better service. 

In baseball, it's three strikes and you're out. This place won't even get the opportunity to see the third pitch."}
{"text":"Good food for lunch, but I would not eat dinner here. 

I like the almond chicken, the cashew chicken and broccoli beef. Avoid the white rice. It is not as good for you as the brown, and Pei Wei tends to leave it in the pot too long after it is cooked. Which means my white rice was mushy and crunky at the same time. Bleagh!

Fast service from the time of order to the plate-slam on the table. Get in, get full, get out. 

This place is about 6 blocks north of the 7th Ave. exit from I-10, so it is possibly a rest stop for the through traveler going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had a disastrous experience here after placing a to-go order online. They didn't have my order ready when I got there and then lost track of it for ~20 minutes. They then tried to give me food that ha been sitting, ready to go, for 15+ minutes. When I refused, they looked at the times and decided to remake the order. The whole process took me 30 minutes to pick up a to-go order that should have taken less than 5 min.
The only reason I give them 3 stars as opposed to 1 or 2 is because the manager came by and apologized and the staff was very apologetic as well."}
{"text":"Messed up my order!!!!! I ordered a KIDS TERIYAKI CHICKEN! Why would they give me STEAK??????? For a kids meal? And it wasn't even good steak at that... disgusting. Threw it away. I live far so I couldn't go back and change it. Will never eat here AGAIN"}
{"text":"OK,..I am the biggest Pei Wei fan you know,..I promise! But aside from the decor, PW Asian Market is a HUGE downgrade from PW Asian Diner.

Negatives:
-100% of food now served in boxes? What the? You can't wash a dish, or real utensils? 
- Portion sizes,..easily 1/2 of what they once were, price only slightly less. :-(
- Call out your number to pick up your food? Really? Whose idea was that? Nothing says \"hospitality\" like getting your number yelled out at you and dashing to pick up your food and then dashing back to your table.
- Asian Sandwiches? Again,.. where did line form asking for \"Somebody please bring us Asian Sandwiches\"? They lack taste and are served on \"bread\" the consistency and taste of cardboard, swing and a BIG miss!

Positives:
The surviving six dishes from the Diner model are still awesome,. just served in micro-portions, get two they're small!

I want my old school Pei Wei back! 

PS - P. Fleming, did you think to ask any \"customers\" about your new ideas?

Lost without my Pei Wei,...."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Your average Pei Wei. Parking is a huge pain in the ass here."}
{"text":"I am SO addicted to the vegetarian Thai dynamite. I don't think I will ever be able to order anything else. The tofu lettuce wraps are also a must EVERYTIME."}
{"text":"Busy night here. Went in the front door and waited about 15 mins in line to order. Then found out we has to wait in a different line to actually since our order was to go. Another 10 mins waiting in that line before we could order.  I can see where this model would be better than the normal pick-up only window, but they definitely don't display it well. 

The food is usually good so I'll update the review after we eat."}
{"text":"Nice place, very clos from my place. I get a call to take order. I just wait 5 minutes in place to pick and go back home. Good welcome and low price"}
{"text":"A separate gluten-free menu always wins me over. What's more, the food (spicy chicken) was really delicious, which is somewhat unexpected for GF. The sauce was based on sweet and sour and was just the right amount of spicy.

More choices involving the use of GF soy sauce (it's out there) would have me eating there more often. The dishes on the GF menu are limited, but at least they have some, I guess, so I'm thankful; it's a start."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.

Very clean.

Friendly folks.

Beautiful patio"}
{"text":"Love the service!   Food always fresh and very filling.  Waiting for the return of the blazing noodles or thai river noodles of which was removed from the menu (?) One particular server always sticks out - running circles around everyone... His name is Mason and always has he made our visit a pleasure."}
{"text":"Excellent as always.  Had my faves....crispy honey shrimp and lettuce wraps. Love how they keep adding dishes to their menu."}
{"text":"So good . We love coming here for dinner.....Mongolian beef and sushi rolls are amazing.....fast service."}
{"text":"For me this is as good as Chinese food gets on this level. 

They use all white meat chicken. None of their meat is fatty or full of grease either!

Vegetables are cooked to perfection.. cooked to a perfect crispiness. 

The ordering & food serving concept is efficient and great as well. 

Price isn't too bad either..A couple dollars more than those nasty C rated places but WAY worth it. 

This chain is owned by PF Changs so your always guaranteed to get a consistant, good quality meal here :)"}
{"text":"I really like Pei Wei.  But you have to understand what it is.  It is a chain.  It is not quite fast food, but not quite a restaurant.  It is rarely great, but almost never bad.  It's consistent, like most chains are.

The crab wontons are tasty, and I love the sweet chili sauce that they come with.  

Mongolian Beef, Honey Seared Shrimp are a couple of our go-tos.

There are much better Chinese/Asian restaurants in the world.  There are also quite a few worse.  Like I said, it is consistent and reliable - and sometimes that's all I need.  I rarely crave Pei Wei specifically, but I would never turn it down."}
{"text":"I love how you can get chinese and other asian dishes so fast here and the quality and price isn't that bad either! 
They have a great salad called the chopped chicken salad and it's asian style, Very Good! Their Thai dishes aren't hot like they should be, but for fast food it's Good!"}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei... But not this Pei Wei! Not only the worst Pei Wei I've been too, but one of the worst restaurants I've been to in my life. I even went three different times to make sure I had to write this place off. First time, they brought out our lettuce wraps and the meat was so burnt you could smell it before they put the plate down. Second time the wonton soup was cold and the dumplings had fallen apart because they had sat for so long... Third time was the worst! Was taking my second bite into the lettuce wrap and there was a half squished bug on the lettuce and it was still squirming! I just put my food down and walked out; never to return. I will go to Panda Express before going to Pei Wei! DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of my favorite restaurants.  They have a good selection of food and their prices are decent.  Their food is fresh and so far I've liked everything I've tried.  They have a great kids menu, too.  This location is clean and has quick service.  The staff are friendly, too."}
{"text":"I occasionally order take- out from this one, so I will address the McDowell location specifically.  The parking lot is completely too small for the volume of lunch and dinner business they generate. It's in a bad part of Phoenix, so I don't recommend parking down one of the neighborhood streets. However, if you need a Phoenix cop, this place is swarming with them like flies. One day I counted (5) patrol units in the parking lot.  The food is good however, and they are amenable to changing menu items to suit your palate. Though a bit overpriced for what is essentially \"fast food\" it's still tastes better than other Chinese take-out joints."}
{"text":"There spicy ramen dish is delicious! Great food, fast service, great place to eat. Lunch is super busy around 12-12:30"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a good stand by for quick asian foods. I had the Dan Dan noodles with tofu last night & it was very good. I am not a huge fan of their tofu. It's a very tough/dry baked style. I prefer a softer style tofu. We have had really bad luck with this particular location for take out. Almost everytinme we do take out, they mess up something in our order. We ate in last night & everything was good. My hubby had Caramel Chicken & it was very unusual , but good."}
{"text":"Terrible.  My wife and I went there early afternoon on Thursday.

First, the counter attendant commits the ultimate faux pas:

\"Are you together?\"

Well duh, it's 2010.  Two wedding bands, my wife has lineage from Germany and Sweden and me, somewhere in N. Africa, but at least greet me before telling me that my wife of 10 years and I don't look like a couple.

Next, the food was miserable.

I had an \"Orange Peel Beef\" and the dish felt like someone breaded beef jerky, fried it hard and poured a bottle of mystery sauce over it.  All of the chili sauce at Pei Wei's couldn't save the dish.   Any vegetables in the dish had the consistency of something unpacked out of the freezer and dumped right in the deep fat fryer.  

Again, I ask myself, why in the world can't we get at least basically edible Chinese in Arizona?

My wife, or colleague as the front counter attendant assumed, ordered some chicken dish.

Again, over-breaded, had the taste and consistency of an order of McDonalds McNuggets drenched in a tub of sweet 'n sour sauce and poured over white rice.

This was literally the first time we went back to our home and dug out leftovers after spending almost $30 on lunch.  

Literally, my best experience about our meal at Pei Wei was the drive home.  Three of three strikes, shame on us for giving it another shot.

Pei Wei was awesome about three years ago, but now it's to the level of Paradise Valley Mall food court and that sucks.  This place needs an enormous amount of customer service training and at least a weekend \"food stand-down\" and retraining of the chef's.

I was HEAVILY disappointed.  Again."}
{"text":"Today was my third time in here so I'm going to go ahead and recommend this place to others. They have a great variety of food and their prices are very reasonable. The staff was also very friendly. The only thing is that their phad thai does not taste like traditional phad thai, it is more like a stir fry. However, this place was clean and brings you a huge portion of food@"}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere. I love the cleanliness of the place as well. Great foods better than McDonald."}
{"text":"Wow pei Wei used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Since then prices have gone up and quality has gone WAY down! My friend accurately described the food as tasting like soap. I literally couldn't finish my meal because it tasted gross and I wasn't totally sure the chicken was thoroughly cooked. On top of that the staff is very depressing and unfriendly. Can't wait for this place to close and be replaced with a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Crunch Rolls were the best! Food was great, except the white rice was dry. That is the reason we only have 4 stars. They have a freestyle soda machine. Relaxing atmosphere. Pretty inside."}
{"text":"Delicioso!! This was the 1st time I had been to this location & 1st time my husband had ever had Pei Wei. 
This location is much bigger & brighter than the one on Eastern. I like it.
My fave dish is Kung Pao chx ordered extra spicey :) yes they can do that. 
wonton soup is yummy too.. lett wraps very flavorful, not too big of a fan of their fried rice. Taste like too much soy sauce.
LOVE the fresh veggies used in each dish.
Will choose Pei Wei for chinese every time :)"}
{"text":"Just keeps getting worse. Ordered online. I specified 6:30 for pickup which gave them 35 minutes to complete the order. Got there at 6:35 and they said I was the third ticket in line. In the end the order was over 15 minutes late."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of choices for quick service in Ocotillo, so we tend to go here a decent amount. I like the food in general, but find they use a bit too much sauce in general...it's dripping. I have had several times where the meat portion had some bad, fatty cuts. There's nothing worse than a surprise of that. But...it's good more often than not!"}
{"text":"The food is great and customer service is the best! The Dan Dan noodles are dynamite but they come standard pretty spicy...  I placed a pick up order by phone and asked for them to be mild, but they ended up being  spicy!  When I got home and tried to eat them they were too spicy.  I called in and spoke to the manager and he took care of it completely and replaced the order for me at no charge!"}
{"text":"Except for the awkward and somewhat confusing \"Order upon entry\" setup they have, very impressed with the food quality / taste and beverage selection... A tad noisy due to the open layout, but nothing to prevent me from returning for another round of Asian deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Not loving the new Pei Wei. Portions seem smaller and food is very inconsistent. I know they are trying new menu items but I'm yet to find one I like. Sometimes changing too much is not the best idea."}
{"text":"Decided to give them another try, as my 1st visit was week one.

The Thai wonton soup - tasteless broth with a couple of chards of something green w/ 3 tiny undercooked hard-as-a-rock wontons.

Thai chicken lettuce cups - very fresh and well formed lettuce - more chopped cucumber than was called for - the chicken was overcooked, and tasteless except for the overabundance of  (probably not fresh) line juice and sugar.

See ya!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab a bite if you're out of time and happen to be downtown. Notable dishes which I recommend are the Spicy Korean and Tai Mango Chicken. I mean if you really wanted to try something spicy, healthy and delicious, you wouldn't be gnarling those Big Macs, would you? Plus, Zoe's is just going to take forever and I don't think you want to eat at a greek IKEA.

- Time is but an illusion--lunch time, doubly so
- Do tai chi or yoga before you find a parking spot
- Grab as many fortune cookies as you can without feeling guilty"}
{"text":"The main dish is pretty good, but would steer away from the \"toppings.\" Both the cilantro and lime were brown, wilted and soggy. When I went, the environment was stressful as well. The manager was yelling across the restaurant at her employees, instructing them not to run and yelling at the top of her lungs for someone to ask an employee if he wanted his food for here or to go. Funny thing is, everyone looked to have ear pieces in. Wonder why she felt the need to yell. I also watched her train a new employee with their backs to the door and one man stand at the counter completely ignored for a solid 5 minutes. Overall, would order food to go, pick off and toss the toppings, and not spend anymore time in the place than I have to."}
{"text":"So I finally decided to revisit this place after 5 years or so. Yet,  once again it was very disappointing.  To top it off,  they overcharge you for everything. Then the portions were weak.  You would think that you would get your money's worth,  eh think again. food was not at all impressive either.  So much for giving a restaurant a second chance to impress.  They have lost my business and referrals for good.  Never heading back there."}
{"text":"Three words: Thai Chicken Dynamite!!!!
Two more words: extra limes.
One last word: divine!

I could probably eat here three times a week and still not feel like I'm getting enough. I used to love going to P.F. Changs, but Pei Wei is so much more convenient and affordable. I don't care that it's not \"authentic\" (I've had enough \"authentic\" food in my life to know that it's not my favorite) I love it. Be sure to grab a dozen fortune cookies for the road."}
{"text":"You've failed me three times too many Pei Wei.

I used to crave your Thai Dynamite. The formerly juicy delight was dry with little to no sauce at all. The once crispy chicken had random bites where the breading was a mess of powdery and damp as if it weren't fully cooked.

I don't know what has happened over the years but the steady decline in quality really saddens me.

The one saving grace this last time was that the rice was at least cooked properly. I don't know if it's a California Pei Wei thing to over/under cook the rice, but at least they can do it right in Arizona (which is very surprising...). But is it really a victory if you have moved up to mediocre?

As a side note I should have known something was awry when the person taking my order corrected my order and told me it was 'thigh' Dynamite. Maybe she was warning me."}
{"text":"I went around lunch time and it was pretty busy. My husband went to wait in line while I went to find a table (this is a seat yourself restaurant). I am 8 months pregnant and was holding my upset 2 year old. I waited patiently for people to leave a table and then, completely exhausted, sat down with my son. The manager told me I had to get up and wait longer because there were others waiting in front of me. I understand that there are others waiting, but sometimes common courtesy should trump order. Especially when it is seat yourself, and you're telling a super pregnant woman she has to get up with her toddler. Shame on that manager. The food wasn't worth it. I would have left but my son was starving. All the meat tastes chewy like it has a layer of fat around each bite. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding the nice thing is you get choices from different parts of Asia. The prices are reasonably with big portions. The Dan Dan noodles are a favorite the lettuce wraps are good too, fried rice is tasty. The one bad flaw of this location is that at certain times the goes outside the door which can be annoying."}
{"text":"Another visit.  Returned my orange peel beef again.  They consistently cook it to the consistency of a cremated piece of wood.  I returned the dish and asked for king Pau chicken instead.  Chicken was great, but the accompanying brown rice was ice cold.   Just can't seem to get things right here.  

I'll try going to the one on Gilbert road instead."}
{"text":"Back in my Wildcat Days, I was a huge Pei Wei fan.  No joke, I was probably there twice a week.  Over the years, I feel like the quality of food has gone a little down hill.  They probably have more than doubled the number of restaurants during that time so I guess that is an understandable side effect. 

However, about 3 months ago, they did something awful.  Possibly un forgivable.  They took away the blazing noodles (by far their best dish) The night I discovered this, I wanted to walk out but I was with a group so I decided not to cause a scene.  The girl who took our order told me that the Chili Beef Ramen was the same thing, just with a different name.  I made the fatal mistake of trusting her and I ordered it

BIG mistake.  Not only was it not the same thing, it was disgusting and it had a smell that I think is impossible to accompany fresh food. After about 10 minutes of trying to force myself to be ok with the dish, I finally decided to ask the girl who made the awful recommendation if I could order something different.  

Much to my surprise she said no and that I had had it too long (the bowl of smelly noodles was full)  I am hoping that this was the snooty employees policy and not the restaurants.  I was too annoyed to care.

That night I left Pei Wei hungary for the first time.

RIP Blazing Noodles, you will be forever missed"}
{"text":"I travel to Scottsdale for work often and this location is a frequent lunch spot.  Portions are pretty generous but food is definitely on the heavier side. Not something I can eat more than a couple times a month. They've added some new items on the menu since my last visit.   The Chili Ramen is my new favorite.  Really spicy and thankfully a lot less sauce than most of their other items.  Staff here is pretty friendly although it can get pretty crowded during lunch."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain Chinese place, but it is very good and quick.  Ive had multiple dishes and all are very tasty.  Iv'e also introduced my friends who I moved here with from Chicago and they enjoy it just as much.  Always made fresh, good tasting, and the people have always been friendly at this location.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei and I have been probably one of there best customers. I go pretty much daily since they started . No one seems to mention this here in this sorta forum , but everyone I know verbally complains about the temperature. Many times I had to leave with groups that just refused to eat there unless the weather was nice outside.

Perhaps because they already left and never ate is why not or few complaints on yelp! But its too cold in there!! FREEZING!! So for those who love the place as I do SPEAK UP ! With negative reviews, perhaps we can persuade them to be more successful despite themselves! :-))

 Its not just this location either, Rain tree is just as bad. 

When I say something to the manager at the Rain tree location he actually said he welcomed the complaint and said its his # 1 complaint! 

He wished that more people would complain to corporate ( which I did ..TWICE). No Response as of yet.:(

 BTW at Greyhawk the day before, an employee in a winter jacket stated that everyone complains but he cannot change the temperature as its set by corporate ! So I left!

 Lastly yesterday I ate there at the counter talked with the manager whom responded,  \"Yes I do get complaints , I get even more in the summer.\"..  I set it at 75 degrees. He then  turned around went on about his business!

Sure a 1 star is as harsh as there inept responses that I believe are fully supported by there lame corporate imbeciles:(

But hey , aside from that,\" I love the place\"! :-)) ( REALLY) For most of the other negative responses, I have found that  most things they will gladly comp or fix any negative food experience you have. 

Just don't you dare ask them to make it comfortable while your eating ! :-))"}
{"text":"Had lunch there on Tuesday and was impressed that they made my Spicy Chicken Salad my way, instead of the way it's on the Menu, and to make the visit that much more refreshing, the young lady who is the Manager came over while I was eating to make sure my Salad was to my satisfaction. That's all a customer wants is to know they care about your satisfaction and repeat business."}
{"text":"We usually love to come here for a tasty low key family meal. We have not been in in a few weeks and are sadly surprised with both the menu changes and flavor of our favorite dishes.
My Dandan noodles were oddly tasteless and had none of the usual spice to them. The Mongolian beef, chicken teriyaki and lettuce wraps were equally disappointing. 
The chicken in the teriyaki bowl resembled the flavor Mc Donalds nuggets with some sauce dumped on it.
The Mongolian beef was overly sweet and the sauces for both the dandan noodles and lettuce wraps almost tasted watered down. 
Please bring back the flavors we love."}
{"text":"I had the garlic ginger broccoli chicken and it was not very good. The broccoli was hardly cooked and the sauce was way to sweet. Everything else was great. I will give them a few more tries before I write them off as another crappy Asian restaurant in Surprise."}
{"text":"I moved away for a year, and looked forward to eating here, but was disappointed, I'm wondering if the have changed ownership or are cutting corners??"}
{"text":"Veggies not cooked and my bowl was watery. This was my first time at this restaurant and i think my last. Food was not great and the store was kinda dirty and needed a good sweeping. The only ok thing was my sushi and even that was border line ok. Good alternative to panda express in my eyes."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to go for lunch while on contract in the Ballantyne area. They have several tasty options for people of all dietary preferences. Every meal I have had at Pei Wei has been well made and not over cooked (it's amazing how many people don't know how to cook broccoli). Their tofu is great (it's amazing how many people don't know how to cook tofu).

Even during the lunch rush, they are pretty good about getting out well made orders. I have never had a problem getting back to work on time taking a lunch here and that is important. The atmosphere is rather nice nice. Dimly lit but on a nice day there is a nice amount of sun light coming in through the large windows. Plenty of seating. I never once had to wait for a table during the lunch rush.

All around Pei Wei is a solid choice for lunch in Ballantyne area. Heck, it wouldn't even be a bad spot for a date. Oh, and yes, they do server beer. Not a great selection, but they do."}
{"text":"Oooh Pei Wei, how I've missed you! :( This place blows Panda Express out of the water! The food is scrumptious for semi-fast food, Asian cuisine. One thing is for sure, they have some pretty good quality napkins. :) And they don't even skimp on them like some Asian restaurants. You ask for more napkins, and they give you one more. Bleh!

Top picks:
Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps
Thai Wonton Soup
Lo Mein Noodles (I like the tangy taste.)
Honey Seared Chicken
Thai Dynamite Chicken

Can someone please bring Pei Wei to the Bay Area? Pretty, pretty please?!"}
{"text":"Never really disappointed when we go to Pei Wei. I find consistency,prices,service and ease of ordering the standouts here. Wish there was more room for diners b/c sometimes there are no table available w/o a bit of a wait. That tells me that they are doing things right I guess!! Untill we find an Asian restaurant that meets our expectations, Pei Wei will be the one we choose when we crave Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, we were so excited to try it since I got a gift card for my birthday. We went in an ordered are whole meal and they did not except are gift card, because their system was down. Unacceptable, this would have been so helpful if we would have known this prior!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I would not give this five stars is it is an \"express eatery\" where you order at the cashier, prepare your own drinks and get your own silverware.  Then they show up with your food based on number assigned to your order.  This is owned by PF Changs but, in my opinion, is better.  

Better selection because it isn't just \"Chinese.\"  Also because there isn't a focus on service, the food goes straight to your table as soon as it is ready.  It always comes to the table very hot.  There should be more of these around.  I have stopped going to the main PF changs now.  I can get the same dish, better, faster, and cheaper AND it is near my house!  Bonus!  Good place for groups and for families, too."}
{"text":"Good food wheat for lunch and there out of white rice right when I get my order. How do you run out of white rice at a chines food restaurant"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.

Young staff that feel entitled and don't care about the customer. Additional training needs to be provided and don't expect to receive a thank you or your welcome from the staff. If you like attitude and like to be treated poorly this is the place for you."}
{"text":"If I could give the new Pei Wei zero stars I would. Decided to give it one last try and it was even worse than before. Tried the Honey Seared Chicken and it was the most dry dish I've ever had. It also had no flavor, which is one thing that kept me going back to the old Pei Wei. We also tried a salad, but it basically only tasted like the little tangerines pieces in it. I guess I should've known this was a bad place when they completely eliminated the kids menu. Oh, and putting everything in to-go dishes just seems so wasteful! I won't return here ever again."}
{"text":"I had to make a Yelp account just for this. Some people may think that I am making a mountain out of a molehill but I am, honestly, disgusted by this and it has killed my appetite for the rest of my meal.

My husband and I swung through to pick up some Pei Wei on our way home. We usually never have problems and the food is good. However, this time was different. I ordered the steak teriyaki on noodles and a cup of the wonton soup. My husband got sweet and sour steak on fried rice and a thai chicken roll. His food was fine.

I LOVE the wonton soup and was excited to eat it when we got home. I put my daughter to bed and then pulled the top off my soup and began to eat. The soup is fairly murky so I didn't notice the issue until I was over halfway through the cup and had eaten most of the greens and all three wontons: there was an insect, a fly of some kind, smashed up against the side of the plastic dish. I immediately set the cup of soup down, feeling really nauseous. I'd eaten this.

I'm not trying to shame Pei Wei or their employees as our experience there is usually very good, but I feel the need to share this with them on Yelp since I took a picture of the insect, and the restaurant is now closed so I cannot return to speak with them directly.

Working in food-service, we know that insects are not only gross to be in food, but can harbor potential foodborne illnesses and be a huge problem. Employees MUST, at least, look at the container they are using to ensure that it isnt contaminated before we give it to a customer to eat.

Now I have a bowl of steak teriyaki getting cold in the garbage because I was too nauseated to eat it."}
{"text":"My husband is a very picky eater, so when we want Asian food pei wei is the perfect place to go. They pretty much let you put whatever you want on or in your meal without charge as long as you don't say \"add vegetables.\" We usually order pick-up, and sometimes they remember everything in our order, and sometimes they don't. Sometimes they remember to put sauce on our food, and sometimes they don't. I'm just glad they exist so I can have some sort of Asian food in my life without huge battles with my husband. :)"}
{"text":"This is still the best Pei Wei in the valley. Nobody has that consistency! Great job team and good job Bryan for helping our table with silverware and chili paste. Very pleased and we will continue to come as per usual. Have a blessed day everyone. - EC"}
{"text":"This review is for Janelle! she was exceptionally attentive and friendly :) with out her this review would be 3 stars at best. As a vegetarian i might suggest better training for the check out guy as he could not accurately explain exactly what was going on with the veggie options. After extensive assessment of the menu i had to infer for myself that anything fried is not vegetarian friendly, though i had already ordered the spring roll (no veggie sign next to it) because i was told that it didn't need a leaf because it was already vegetarian... but if that was the case why does edamame get one? anyways... Janelle's very friendly service made up for my bland plate of veggies, and my meat loving boyfriends meal was apparently delicious, so 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"Very clean and nice location!  My husband and I came in for lunch and each ordered a separate dish, but the portions were so huge we could have easily shared!  Each of us were able to get 3 meals out of our individual plates (he had the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, and I had the Chicken Fried Rice).  This location also had one of those neat soda machines with the 100+ options, and though not a soda drinker myself it made me want to get one to try it out!  Food came up fast and service was friendly.  Would definitely drop in again!"}
{"text":"Waited about 8 minutes for some acknowledgement from the staff.  The store wasn't very busy and now we understand why.  We walked out and added it to our do not eat there list."}
{"text":"Shtty Service and Mess Up My Order Twice, Served Me a Stir Fry with Raw Mushrooms, Yuck."}
{"text":"Being owned by PF Chang's, I was really expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately this was not the case. I ordered the Spicy Korean Chicken, a cup of Hot and Sour Soup, and a drink. While the food was cooked perfectly there really was no flavor at all. The soup tasted like a beef broth made with buillion cubes without a single hint of sour or spice. The Spicy Korean Chicken was moist, but unless your idea of spicy is black pepper your out of luck. Yes, I know you can add some spice after the fact but when you order something spicy you expect SOME form of heat. Overall, it was not worth my $12 for lunch. I will give it another shot as I know this may have been a one off, but right now I'd rather eat at Panda Express."}
{"text":"Was there today for takeout. Friendly service, got the order correct. My Mongolian beef was good but my two kids meals were absolutely pathetic. Why even offer kids meals if you don't put any effort into them? Terrible! Don't even waste your money. Unfortunately,I'm the only one who likes this place so my family won't be back and I probably won't either."}
{"text":"Always good, Very Clean restaurant and the food is great for a fast -Casual Restaurant."}
{"text":"Perhaps you know that guy who likes to talk in \"quotes\". Well, he would definitely be at home at Pei Wei, and especially at this location.

Set in Phoenix's \"historic district\" Pei Wei is supposed to represent a sign of \"urban renewal\" for the city's core. It's wedged on a very small parcel of land at the southwest corner of McDowell and 7th Avenue. As alluded to it's \"parking lot\" causes one to draw lots...because there's no guarantee of finding a space if you fancy eating a meal other than breakfast or dinner here. Nevertheless, the restaurant's architecture embodies a bit more \"character\" than one might be used to Arizona. Free-standing, it favors a \"sophisticated\" and \"historic\" look with brick-lined interiors.  

Inevitably, there will be a prodigious line awaiting you (and your money). This is actually a benefit to you trying to read the \"menu' posted on boards along the entry-way. The selections are all \"Asian fusion\" which defies description probably as much as the term \"electability\". Don't be fooled, there is little or no guarantee that any person of Asian descent got within miles of providing any contribution to your meal. Nevertheless, the food has been carefully calibrated to appeal to the \"fast casual\" palette. 

And adhering to the mantra of \"fast casual\", you'll find all the service quality of Souplantation. You order your food, you take your number, they give you a table, they drop off your food and they take away your tray. This \"forward-looking\" and \"innovative\" human resource strategy doesn't seem to solve the wait for your food, but it probably does keep costs down.

The spectre of \"gentrification\" tends to raise prices...but in this regard Pei Wei still appeals to the rapidly disappearing \"middle class\". It's not possible to match the \"value\" of say In-N-Out here, but you can eat for under $10 easily. And even though the company has lost the role of culinary \"vanguard\" to say, Pinkberry, it's still one of the better options for lunch in the shadow of downtown."}
{"text":"Food is sometimes good, but mostly inconsistent. I usually get a tofu meal of donor sort and they never cook it correctly, usually it's super squishy and not appetizing. The customer service is not greatest, I find myself often waiting to get acknowledged when picking up food."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for Asian cuisine, this is the place.  This restaurant is located within a half mile of where I live, so I always order food to go.  The staff is excellent, the food is very, very good, and the pick up window is usually fast (sometimes they get very busy and you have a bit of a wait).  They also have what they call \"curbside delivery\", which means you can drive up to the south side of the building near the take out door, and stay in your vehicle.  They will come to you. Try the hot and sour soup, it's the best. Several of their dishes are made with hot spices, which I love, so if you are calling in and order and don't like your food spicey, be sure to let them know.  Pei Wei is a less expensive chain associated with P.F. Chaing's China Bistro."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is slipping a little in my opinion. I used to love this place when they first opened (7 or 8 years ago) and I'd go all the time. However, I feel like the food hasn't been as good the last few years. At least, the chicken lo mien isn't very good. It's borderline flavorless. Every time I order it I end up regretting it. I wish they'd revamp this dish. Flavor please! 

However, the chicken lettuce wraps are still good. 

They're still popular and super busy during peek times. So call in and pick up."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei.  Chinese food without the waiters.  Good food and good value.  Kung Pao Chicken on Brown rice is my favorite."}
{"text":"In my opinion the place is poorly managed. On what is to be my last visit I asked if I wanted an Asian Chopped Chicken Salad without the chicken would it be less. I am a vegetarian and am annoyed when I order a dish and leave off the meat (the most expensive part) and get charged the same price.  I am ok with it if the offer to make the rest a larger portion. The manager suggested I instead of getting the salad I wanted for $7.29 that I get a Side Salad for $2.99 which is what I did.  So I didn't get what I really wanted, and the restaurant got $2.99 from me instead of $6.29 which I would have been happy to pay for the salad I really wanted without the chicken.  And don't get me started on how disgustingly filthy their method for refilling ice is."}
{"text":"My husband really likes Pei Wei's, but the floor in here is very red which makes me uncomfortable.  Are they trying to make me feel mad?  Other than that very good food.  I got the sweet and sour.  The futuristic soda machines are confusing though and added with the blood red floor I got very heated.  Fix the color scheme please I will be back frequently."}
{"text":"I have had Pei Wie before and was not impressed.  I live near this location and was recently tempted by the great smell coming from this place.  It's too bad they food didn't taste half as good as it smelled.  
I ordered hot and sour soup.  That was not soup.  It was some viscous brown stuff in a bowl that tasted like nothing.  It was neither hot nor sour.  I also ordered the (not)  dynamite chicken extra spicy.  It was not spicy at all and as a matter of fact had very little flavor.  I decided not to try to finish either dish and just threw them both away.   I won't be wasting anymore money on Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei! Love it. I always have pleasant interactions with the employees. I usually get my food to go. They know me. They are fast and my order is always correct. However, this last time I ordered online I went in to pay and the girl behind the counter was beyond rude. It was as if she couldn't be bothered to ring me up. She didn't ask what condiments I wanted. I get the salad, I add another dressing to it. It wasn't busy at all. She acted very snotty and wouldn't even make eye contact with me. As if i was putting her out. She had the eye roll and all. I went in there in a good mood. Told her I had a pick up  order and my name after she asked me and her attitude was enough to keep me away. I go to Pei Wei about every 2 weeks. It has been over 2 months now, all because of the cashier rung me up.  Either fix her attitude or put someone else who is friendly up there."}
{"text":"One star only because I can't give a zero star review.

Meals came out after forty minutes... And various portion came out at varying times. Two meals were finished before others came out. Everyone couldn't eat together. 
Appetizers came out last.. And cold.

Very disappointing. Spend your dollars elsewhere.. Too many better choices."}
{"text":"ordered to go , incorrect order,, cold food frankee the manager blew us off really not good business , take out person was rude , unprofessional the ONLY reason I will be going back is a manager named Sara she says she will rectify the situation which has not happened yet but I am trusting that it does!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for take out, giving this location 2 stars because of the poor service. Good was great as always but the take out service was horrible. Online order said the food would be ready by 6:40pm, I got there at 6:50pm and the girl who helped me at the take out counter rung me up and said my order would be ready soon. She didn't even check the done orders on the table behind her, after she helped me she went to the back computer to help bag up orders. After 10 minutes I asked the other girl at the counter on the status of my order and giving her my name she found my order on the table and handed me the order. So in the end the 1st girl didn't even look for my finished order which was done on time, the restaurant wasn't  even that busy compared to other times I've been there. The take out section looked disorganized and overwhelmed, I'll be driving to the Pei Wei on 67th Ave for any future orders now."}
{"text":"I live just a couple of blocks away and I've been going here off an on since the place opened. I used to to get good service but the last 2 times I've been here I ended up just walking out. The 1st time I walked in and and wanted to order some sushi rolls and the girl at the take out counter first said they were limited to 2 types and then when I was ordering said they were completely out. She then went back to the kitchen guys to confirm and they were out of all types. The last time I called ahead to see if they had any sushi rolls and the gal said yes, after the girl confirmed what they types they had available i asked her to give me a break down of what they had in them. She had no idea and said \"fake crab meat and vegetables\". She sounded young and was hard to understand, like she had a mouth tray or braces. Food is good but if you expect good service, go to another restaurant aside from this one."}
{"text":"When I need a quick delicious bite to eat, I head out to Pei Wei Asian Diner.  I know that I will get quality food and excellent service.  I love the lettuce wraps here!  The Pei Wei spicy chicken is one of my other all time favorites.  It comes out with just the right amount of crispiness.  I have tried to duplicate this recipe at home and can never get it quite right!  It is much easier to head to the restaurant to have it served to me!  

My food always arrives very warm, and I usually find that this restaurant is clean.  These are two things that are very important to me.

If you have never tried this restaurant, you have been missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is a very casual quick stop Chinese place. You can make your own or order one of their premade meals. Honestly for the price and how quick/convenient it is, the food is very good. It is easy to eat there or take away which I sometimes do if I'm busy at the office. Overall, I like it. Wouldn't necessarily recommend to anyone since it isn't really a dinner place or a spot to go out to, but I like it as a solid lunch choice."}
{"text":"The food is great and the prices are good. Everyone is cool here except the waitress lady of chinese decent. Im not at all rascist. Just trying to point out which one. She gives u a dirty look if you don't tip the amount she desires. Its a pei wei not pf changs.  Am I supposed to tip the same? 
Maybe, im wrong? I doubt it but I didnt appreciate her service. She is so fake and friendly to anyone who over tips her. God forbid if you dont. You will feel her wrath. 
I prefer the other pei wei locations but not this one which is close to my house."}
{"text":"After spending a year in Asia, I understand that Pei-Wei is not authentic.  It boasts extremely americanized asian food.  This is an awesome place if your getting take out or dining alone. I would avoid large groups.  

Pei-Wei is what I call a Hybrid Restaurant.

You order as you walk in, and receive your drink from the cashier. You fill your beverage and have a seat.  The waitress brings you your food.   You will not get a paper cup.  You will eat off of real plates with real utensils.  If you need a refill, just ask!  Staff is more than happy to help.  It is very low maintenance and quick.  The management team is superior, the are always available."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times but this will be the last. I had a few pieces of uncooked chicken and I brought attention to the manager which ignored me to begin with but finally after getting her attention I kindly told her my chicken was not fully cooked. She laughed and said \"impossible\" and turned away. I asked the cook if this chicken was uncooked and he agree'd. After arguing for 10minutes with the manager, I was able to get another meal but it came out completely wrong and nothing close to what I had ordered. I ate it anyways being that I did not want to waste the energy dealing with the manager. For future eaters of Pei Wei, check your chicken and double check your order."}
{"text":"This place gets busy at lunch time, but the line moves quickly. Everything I have ordered has always tasted fresh and good. My favorite is the Thai Dynamite with chicken. It has plenty of veggies for me and just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Pei Wei has been a family favorite. Quick and tasty. However, today was less than adequate. We ordered our food at 1:27 pm and received our food at 2:12 pm. I watched as other patrons ordered and received their lunch. I approached a worker who seemed to be the one \"in charge \", but all he could do was say, \"sorry, we are understaffed\". Then proceeded to say, \"there's really nothing else we can do.\" I mentioned I have worked in the food industry before, and understood sometimes you get behind; however, they hadn't even \"dropped\"my food to complete the order. I asked for a manager and was told that he was in the back. It seemed as though I was inconveniencing their lunch. When I received my meal it was messy and incomplete, lacking your typical complete Pei Wei meal. 20 minutes later a young staff member returned to comp our meal. This was not my intent to have a free meal. The initial interaction of a simple apology seemed less than an act of quality customer service. I find that because we were still unsatisfied with the meal quality, they felt an obligation to \"fix\" the complaint."}
{"text":"I have eaten here over the past five years, many locations. It has gone from good to fast food. Product is not good. Too salty, unsavory flavors. I keep trying thinking its me or a bad day and end up regretting it...throwing away cash as I dump the spring rolls cooked in old oil, the fresh rolls that are soggy, the noodle bowl that tastes like rubber noodles....so sad what happened to the quality. Today was my last try."}
{"text":"Probably great food, wouldn't know because the customer service at this location was very poor. Walked in at 6PM to place a take out order. No one in line, great! Placed my order and took their offer for some free water while I wait. Fast-forward 20 minutes and the place is starting to get a little busy. The take out and dine in lines are taking all of the attention of the two employees working behind the counter. 

These two were on top of their game, right before servicing me that is. Everyone else that was waiting when I walked in had been all packed up and sent away with a smile. Not me..I saw my food was up, sitting on the counter where the cooks push the orders, getting colder (no lids) as each minute passed. Five minutes later and several customers serviced without either employee ever checking to see if any food was up. I was there first, right? Why does my food have to sit and why do I have to wait another 5+ minutes when I have already been there for 20?? 

I was pretty upset at this point, but insanity didn't set in until the third employee, (supervisor, or manager, I assume due to attire) came from the back to help out. I was happy to see her and she immediately started to direct traffic. She pointed to the customers waiting, making sure the other two employees didn't stop taking orders, then she started to pack my food. The phone rings and that's when it went from bad, to worse. She stopped packing for me and spent at least another two minutes, or so taking a complete phone order. Why not just place that little guy on hold and finish packing my two tiny dishes? I don't even need a bag, just the food! I'm so close to it! I wanted to walk back and grab it myself! I mean, I already paid, so technically it was mine, right? 

Anyways, when she finally packaged my food, she asked me if I need chopsticks, etc., and I calmly asked if she was the manager. I told her why I was upset and that I just wanted my money back. I explained it thoroughly and the only comment she made was that I could take the food, which I did not. 

I doubt that this review will stop anyone from eating here. I mean, surely the food is good and what I am complaining about wont make you sick. However, if you are someone that feels strongly about good customer service and that the customer is always right, then maybe you will think twice before spending your money in a place that doesn't care about you. 

I will now never eat at a Pei Wei, or a PF Changs..And I will make sure that everyone I know hears this story."}
{"text":"Typical big business chinese place. Slightly fancy but very average food. Kinda like a fast food place.... you walk up and order then get your own drinks etc. Portions are very small. Prices are higher than average.

They offer a few different vegetarian options but it all tastes pretty bad

do yourself a favor and also support a local business and eat at big buddha around the corner. Its much better food"}
{"text":"Love going here for good food.  The dinner portions are big and could easily be shared.  Restaurant is clean and the ambiance is great for socializing and taking a long lunch or dinner.  You never feel \"rushed,\" and I like that.  Staff is attentive and tries hard to make sure that you enjoy your food.  Condiment and drink area is well stocked and clean.  The only complaint that I have is that sometimes the food is a little inconsistent. All in all, I enjoy the food - tastes fresh."}
{"text":"I had never been to this Pei Wei before. I'll start with the con: I ordered a lot of extra sauce, and I was given a VERY small amount of very watered down sauce. 

On the other hand, the girl who took my order was very enthusiastic, and nice. She apparently doesn't usually work at this store, and was just filling in that day. (forget her name)
The young girl with dark brown hair, who packed up my to-go order was very polite, and very nice. 
The manager, Maggie, had a great, friendly attitude, and great customer service. I was very impressed when she let me use these $5 bonus gift cards (that were an extra bonus, when a relative bought me Pei Wei gift cards for Christmas). The $5 bonus cards were expired, but she still honored them, with a happy, cheerful attitude. A good attitude, and good customer service, goes a long way with me. Thank you, Maggie!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Pei Wei in about a year and maybe I'm losing it but it was so much better than I remember. The food was wonderful! Kung Pow chicken tasted so much better than it used to. The portions do seem smaller and the girl behind the counter didn't seem to know where she was. They were out of brown rice and while I was placing my order with white rice, another employee told her that they now had brown rice so I asked for brown rice with my order. She said that it might be too late... Really? I'm still standing here and my credit card is authorizing. Fortunately, the employee who advised her that the brown rice was now available again overheard this and took the action that most 17+ year olds have the work experience to take to make it happen, but that's all."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend today cause we were starving and decide to go whichever next place we saw. And we were very surprised at how pretty the inside of the restaurant looked. The decor was amazing. I ordered the Japanese teryaki bowl vegetarian style and it was amazing. I loved the tofu and the brown rice and the veggies. My friend ordered the lo mein and she loved it. We didn't finish due to the fact that the portions are huge. (we didn't know it was a like share the bowl type of place, and when we figured it out we didn't do it because hers had meat). But overall this place was amazing. The employees are very very nice! And this place is vivid and just amazing. WAY better than panda express. I will definately come here again, and recomend it to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service, ever. 
We placed a to go order, two items, a salad and Pad Thai without chicken. We go to pick up the order, that is when the trouble began. The order was not ready when I went to go pick it up, no problem, I'm happy to wait. The gentleman, Kyle, read off the order, spicy chicken salad and Pad Thai with EXTRA chicken. I stated that was incorrect and that it was with no chicken. He said, \"no problem, they are still making it.\" The order then arrives, the salad is perfect, but Kyle says, \"I'm still confused about the Pad Thai order.\" He pulls it out of the bag, opens the box and proceeds to DIG through the food with the LID from the box! The food was spilled on the counter, and he used the lid to put it back in the box, asking if it looked right. It did, however, I requested that it be remade, as the food had been on the counter, and I feel that was incredibly unsanitary. Kyle was angry at my request and demonstrated as such, by violently throwing the Pad Thai into the trash and pushing the salad against the wall, with so much force that everything spilled all over the bag and then angrily stomped away. I was a little stunned, at the interaction, until a woman came to the counter and asked if she could help me. I said, \"I would just like Pad Thai with no chicken...\" She said okay, walked over the kitchen, asked them for the order to be made like that, and all was well. We will never patronize this location again, I felt disrespected and as if I were an inconvenience. I am disgusted at the caliber of people that have been hired at this location. Shame on you, Pei Wei."}

{"text":"Spicey Pei Wei
By The Rue

I had Pei Wei for lunch today,
It wasn't the best dish,
Next time I think I'll say,
I prefer somewhere with fish.

I got the spicey chicken Pei Wei plate,
With brown rice, not white,
After ordering it wasn't a long wait,
I drank Mello Yellow not Sprite.

The menu said this dish was spicey,
But I had to disagree,
I added hot mustard to entice me,
Oh such a calamity. 

Bok chow (The End)"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from this location last night. I got the Mongolian Beef and my fiancé ordered the Pad Thai. Mine was the same as always, nothing spectacular but there was a huge piece of PLASTIC in my fiancé's Pad Thai! He brought it back for a refund/new order and said that the staff was rude and the kitchen manager just muttered something in Spanish and went back into the kitchen. They refunded us for our meal but we will not be back. Horrible customer service, sub-par food."}
{"text":"While the food here is pretty decent, the last few times I've been here the service has been really slow for both takeout and dining in. 

I brought my brother from out of town here for a quick dinner and when we arrived the place was not too busy but there was a good amount of people waiting for takeout orders. We sat down and waited literally 40 minutes for our food to be served to us. I'm not sure what the problem was but it was as if the cooks were making one dish at a time. Almost everyone in the dining area also waited that long for food to be delivered to them and there were quite a few complaints. The servers offered no explanation or apology as to why it was taking so long and customers started walking out. The employees at the register actually began telling people before ordering that it was going to be a while, causing many people to not even bother. It seemed as if they only cared about getting the takeout orders taken care of first, but even when there were no longer any takeout orders to be filled, the service was still ridiculously slow. 
  
If you are on a tight schedule and looking for somewhere quick to dine, I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today expecting a pleasant stay. But when I walked in, the ambiance was kind of depressing. The waitresses/ waiters didn't seem happy to be there. At all. 

The food was pretty good. But the wait for the food was terrible. I waited for 25 minutes for food while people around us (who came about 15-20 minutes after us) were being served. 

Personally, I wouldn't come back. I have experienced better at the Pei Wei off of West Charleston. Being a regular there, I see much more pleasant employees, ones who ask how your day is going and makes sure if what you ordered is up to your expectations. I don't enjoy giving negative reviews, but this is how I truly feel. 

Thank you."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile and now I know why...

The location and restaurant appearance is nice and was clean and comfortable BUT the food was a huge disappointment.  I saw the pictures of each dish and selected the Pei Wei spicy with chicken and looked like it was stir fried with lettuce cups instead of the rice.  What I got was 6 pieces of chicken swimming in thick gooey sauce that looked jelly-like with 3 slices of carrots so thin you hardly can see them in the sauce and snap peas.  I didn't see all this sauce in the picture and I know it doesn't always look like the picture but it was like I ordered a soup.  The sauce was supposed to be spicy, hence the name but it was more sweet than anything.  

I wanted to complain but I had an infant with me and difficult to carry her around with my plate but when a server came by and asked how everything was, I told her I was disappointed and she grabbed my plane and walked away. I thought perhaps she was going to get the manager but waited outside 15 minutes and no one ever came back out.

A very sad version of Asian American food and will probably continue going to PF Changs rather than Pei Wei in the future."}
{"text":"Girl taking order looked like she was miserable and kept rolling her eyes. No forks and looked like most the employees were are break. Wouldn't Be So Bad If It Wasn't 47 Bucks For A lunch. For fifty bucks I try some where else"}
{"text":"This place is great when it gets our online or telephone order right, but it never happens. Why even have the options available to remove mushrooms and scallions but not take them out of the food."}
{"text":"I love Pei wei. It is one of my favorite restaurants to enjoys some classic Chinese food! However, on my mom recent visit I was less than satisfied. One the waiter set my plate down (honey seared chicken on fried rice) I quickly noticed a piece of long hair strung THROUGHOUT my whole plate. Like started on one side ended on the other, under some of the chicken.. Completely disgusted. I decided to just take it back to the counter (there was only one woman there to help.. Don't think she was the manager..) she took the plate and said they'd remake it. With barely any apology. After about 15 mins I had to go back to the counter myself and found the food sitting there without any one bringing it out to me. I expected the manager to come out and offer some sort of discount but I didn't get that none the less any apology. Once my food was remade if was delicious as usual and I was able to enjoy my meal but I am not please with the staff or service at all."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei and have been going to them for years now and always order the same thing with an occasional try of different dishes being offered but 99% of the time, I order my favorite, Mongolian Beef spicy, extra mushrooms no scallions with white rice. I especially love that they have my # saved or something in their system as when I'd call in for a pick up, they always ask if I'd like the same thing and already have what I want in their system. Kids meal is very reasonably priced too and my daughter loves their chow mein noodle and my son loves the honey chicken. Another thing that's great is that they have these chopstick helpers/buddies if you ask for it (complimentary) as my kids can feel like they're using the chopsticks on their own.  Though there's been a very few time where they've messed up my order (when I order something new usually), they would fix it if brought to their attention and the food is always great at this specific restaurant. Reason I said this location is because I've had 1 incident in San Diego at a different Pei Wei where the cook apparently didnt know how to make it or something as I literally got a mongolian beef soup instead of a stir fry dish as half the dish was liquid. I took a picture of it as I couldnt believe it and meant to write them asking about it but we were on our vacation so I left it alone and didnt bother to report it. But as for this place, I LOVE it and will continue to drive my 35 mins to get to it pretty much whenever I'm up in town, I'll stop in for lunch or on my way home."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great night at Pei Wei, our FAVORITE restaurant in the entire Metrolina area.  We had been overseas for a few weeks, and we dreamed of returning to Pei Wei to enjoy some Sweet and Sour Chicken, plus a giant Dr. Pepper from the Coca Cola Freedom machine.  Within three hours of landing back in Charlotte, we were at Pei Wei, with our Sweet and Sour Chicken ordered.  However, the Freedom machine was out of Dr. Pepper.  Out of Dr. Pepper!  But, to the rescue came Pei Wei's Chris.  He ran out to the store next door with some Pei Wei cash in hand, and he brought us back an entire two liter bottle of cold Dr. Pepper!  We were so surprised, so glad to see the Dr. Pepper in Chris' hands.  Unbelievable Customer Service.  If we could give Chris and the entire team a million stars, we would!  Thanks for making our return to the USA GREAT!"}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup was just plain awful.  The soup was cold, and the base tasted like burnt mushrooms.  The dan dan noodles are without a doubt one of the worst things I've ever eaten -- mushy noodles with a sauce sweet enough for pancakes.  Never again.  This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Front desk service was horrible, she was busy talking on the phone and rushing us through- I ordered the mongolian beef, it was edible but if you've ever actually had mongolian beef from an authentic restaurant don't get it here. We also ordered brown rice which wasn't fully cooked and from what I'm told is the way they do it here. All in all for that meal at least..I'll never go back"}
{"text":"I love pei wei. It's the best place on earth, I've been here for close to 8 years now, same location. Although I've always loved the food, today my Pad Thai was far off than when I've had it before. I've had this dish at least 50 times, it's my go to meal... but today it was lacking the pei wei flavor that it usually has. I go to Pei Wei because their pad Thai is better than anyone else's. It was very sad to see that today it was dry and virtually flavorless. Although it was steaming hot and our order wasn't messed up, I just wish it was like it was when I came here a month ago."}
{"text":"Just had the kung pau chicken!!! delicious and  fast service!!! love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Thai chicken lettuce wraps are my favorite! I also always get their Thai dynamite sauce with beef or chicken with some white rice! YUM! I know the place is packed during lunch and service is a little slow so I usually go in the afternoon! the guy who delivers my food is so nice!"}
{"text":"Help is more interested in what's going on between their co-workers than getting a first timer's order correct. (Was informed it was 1st time there) and now will NEVER be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you are reading this please don't go there. They made the place not appealing to eat in. The mean changed from great to worst. I got the spicy pei Wei they asked me if I wanted a large or market size, so I got the large and it looked no different from the market size i went up to tall them i got the large one they said its only 2oz difference which was not worth the 3 bucks more because there wasn't two more ounces. Don't go trust me the food wasn't that good either."}
{"text":"as a PF changs brand this place is good why pay PF changs price when you can come here and pretty much get the same thing would give 4 stars but the portions are small and I always end up hungry after eating here and no I am not a big person"}
{"text":"love this place. they have gluten free food! and they save your take out order in the computer so double bonus for me. we eat here all the time everyone in the family loves this place. 
they do not have gluten free soy sauce anymore."}
{"text":"Step between Asian fast food and something a little nicer, and for that it's okay. The teriyaki sauce is too salty for my taste, but the caramel chicken and Thai dynamite chicken are both pretty good. The crab wontons always seem to be cold and not at all crispy by the time I get them, but the hot and sour soup has a good level of flavor. I tend to get takeout from here as opposed to eating in the restaurant, and it's always ready on time."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but not for the price.  In the same complex you can get much better and more food for the same price or cheaper at Totts Asian Diner."}
{"text":"Food is terrible. Did they actually think that people would fill their oversized dining room?  I don't get it... All you do is make a few Asian dishes all day, everyday and this is the best you can do? I wouldn't eat here for free."}
{"text":"Used to like to get take out from this restaurant.  Hadn't been in a while, but was looking for some food to bring home so I came back here.  I cannot believe how awful it was.  They did the unimaginable, they have decided to skimp on the quality of the food.  Of the four things I got, only the over-priced lettuce wrap was edible.  The spring rolls were all breading and no stuffing.  The beef was all coating and not very good quality meat.  The crab wontons were mostly mayonnaise or some other mush, not crab.  Will not return.  Too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas area to visit, will not waste valuable resources on this ever again!"}
{"text":"No stars bad service and poor quality food. Spoke to the manager snd it did absolutely no good."}
{"text":"Love the pad thai.just the right amount of oil and just the right amount of meat.. have had more than a dozen times.. will go again !"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  The soft drink machine did not work and the lettuce in the salad was old."}
{"text":"If your online ordering is not going to work then ANSWER the PHONE!!!!!! So I can place an order for pickup."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I love Pei Wei. Great service, delicious food. I'm giving a 2-star review for one reason. I ordered online and went to pick up. I received a meal with chicken instead of what I had ordered, which was a shrimp dish. I'm writing this review to remind you to check your order as you pick it up. Don't get home and find a wrong order in your bag! And Pei Wei, please get the order right so that my brother, who is vegetarian, doesn't have to take out all the chicken from his plate!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. It's was ok. Not what I expected. Semi cafeteria type service."}
{"text":"Went to pei Wei the other day.  Honestly service always is accurate, quick and efficient.  Food is also good, spicy chicken, honey seared chicken, fried rice all very good... This fast food is so much better than others."}
{"text":"Two stars for a clean place and friendly people. The food was just not very good. The hot and sour soup was bland and thin. The fried dumplings were deep fried, not pan fried; the filling was good but the wrapper was more like an empenada, not a dumpling. The spicy Korean beef was drenched in soy sauce. No other flavor to it.  It was so salty I could not eat it.  They offered a replacement dish without complaint -- the chicken pad thai was just OK. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is super good. I love the food and the Fortune cookies. The kids get little practice chopsticks. Their line is very short (about 3-5 minutes).

{"text":"I love Pei Wei however I will most likely return to this particular location. 
First off our bowl of hot & sour soup was missing some inches.
Secondly it took forever to receive our entrees...when they did arrive they were COLD & the honey seared chicken was naked, lacking garnish."}
{"text":"This place is filthy.  I double dare you to look at the booth seating or open one of those chili sauce containers and have a peek.  Had to go through 3 forks to find a clean one.  Bathroom floors?  Sticky.  Not coming here again..."}
{"text":"The first time I went the food was ok. Nothing special.  But the second time the rice tasted like it was rotten.  Couldn't get past the rotten smell   So disappointed.  Every other location I have been to was great.  I will wait 6 months and try again.  Maybe that cook will be gone"}
{"text":"Average asian food, nothing special. Small portion size was massive, which I guess is a positive from a value standpoint, but more than I wanted this day.  Veggie spring roll is fried not fresh as I was hoping."}
{"text":"so this place is exactly like PF Changs but cheaper! I always get Kung Pao chicken and hot/sour soup oh and the delicious fortune cookies lol. 

always greeted warmly. service is great. food is Fantastic! I'm a Big fan!
good size portions. great spicy plates. definately try this place out. everyone I've ever went there with has loved their dishes."}
{"text":"Orange chicken w/ fried rice wasn't to my expectations. Rice wasn't fully cooked plus not enough orange sauce to cover all of my chicken.. Sorry but I will pass by and head to Panda Express next time"}
{"text":"I have been to Pei Wei numerous times before and they were great. However, something about this location was not right. I went here for dinner and right when I walk in, the place was warm. Not sure if it was because of the kitchen being so close to the seating area, but it felt nicer outside. The floors were messy. When we were looking for a seat, my girlfriend stepped on a fortune cookie and veggies that were left by a previous customer. There were food on the floor from different dining stations, not just our area. 

Now onto the food..
We got Teriyaki Crunch Roll for sushi. It was cold, the wasabi looked like play doh that a child rolled up into a ball, and they had extra wasabi drizzled underneath the sushi. Not everyone is a fan of wasabi, so they should not put the sushi on top of drizzled liquid wasabi. We could have had better sushi elsewhere. I would compare it to sushi you can buy at a supermarket. 

We also got Mongolian Beef. Usually it is cooked just like the P.F. Chang recipe. Thick, juicy, with a little bit of a crisp, added with mushrooms and green onions . However, I'm not sure if they changed the recipe or the cooks didn't cook it correctly. The beef was cooked with a little pink left in them, which isn't bad. It was soft.. too soft. The beef was very chewy. The green onions were also soggy. 

The Traditional Lettuce wrap was okay. Not much complain there. 

Overall, the service was good, the sushi was very bad, the food was okay, and the place was decent."}
{"text":"I ordered a glass of beer and a spicy Polynesian poke bowl at 11:49. I finally received my food at 12:19 after I got up and told the cashier something. This is the second consecutive visit in which I waited for my food for thirty minutes, which is why I wrote this review. I've only visited this location four times and half of my visits have been less than ideal. What appalls me the most is that no manager or person of authority came out to say a simple apology. I get that lunch is busy, however, it does not pardon management from apologizing to their guest for waiting longer than normal for their food. As a restaurant manager myself, I've gone by the motto; \"avoidance is acceptance\". I know long ticket times is not the norm, but if the lack of accepting responsibility and not apologizing to your guest is, it might be a while until I return to this location, let alone recommend it to friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"Best location! They have such a great menu, being a test kitchen. The food always comes out quick, fresh, hot and they have great employees working there!"}
{"text":"I had the Thai Dynamite with vegetables and tofu and brown rice last night and it was very good.  The tofu is very, very firm and tasty, and the veggies were cooked to perfection -- not overdone at all, especially the broccoli.  I would love to know how to prepare tofu like that at home.

I was feeling too tired to cook after my long run yesterday, so this was perfect.  And the portion sizes are huge!  Normally, it might be enough for two servings, but for a hungry runner, only one!

Also tried the spring rolls for the first time, but they were really nothing special, so I'll skip these next time.

Another good thing:  they don't add any MSG to the dishes."}
{"text":"while dining today i was shocked to see a COCKROACH crawling up the wall..i had a nice portion leftover for a snack packaged up and ready to go,needless to say i lost interest in that.probably my last time there!"}
{"text":"They were busy for a Tuesday night at dinner rush, but the new Light offering of replacing the rice with a salad was worth the wait in my book! My entrée was served on a generous portion of iceberg lettuce with julienne zucchini, carrots, tomatoes and light Asian noodles. I removed 1/2 of the entrée and took it in a to go box and was very satisfied with me meal. This is my go to spot for dinner out at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"We had orderd a large meal online and it was ready early. Delicious food, great service. We even had an issue and it was remedied quickly, with no hassles! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered on-line before I left the office, walked in, paid, and was off home for dinner. Super easy and fast. And the food is always delicious. My son loves the Honey Seared Beef, and I love the Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls. The fortune cookies are always spot on. :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't our best experience.  The Vietnamese salad was made up of mostly yellow/brown lettuce. Not much flavor.  The Mongolian Shrimp with quinoa and sauce was hard to choke down even when you are starving.  The staff seemed to be  in a not so good mood.  It had been a hot minute  since the last time I had been there and I don't remember it being this bad.. I'm hoping it was just a off night for this place."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location before, but I didn't think twice before placing my Pick-Up order because of all the great experiences and food I've had at other locations. Yikes -- it did NOT turn out as I expected!! I ordered two Vietnamese chicken rolls and 1/2 order of sushi rolls (it had mango in it, but I can't remember the name for some reason). This location doesn't take online orders, and the wait time on the phone was about 15 minutes. My order was ready for pick-up on time (but warning, parking is hard around the lunch hour). I grabbed my bag of food, headed back to the office, and was surprised when I opened the box of Vietnamese rolls.  One of the rolls was split down the middle and falling apart. Bummer. I used a fork to eat it, and opaque liquid dripped off the pieces that I forked up. Gross. I then noticed that, instead of peanut sauce, they gave me sesame ginger vinaigrette that is meant for a salad (I think). What!? The second roll was falling apart from excessive liquid, too. But, what was worse, was the FISHY taste when I bit into it. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE CHICKEN! I dug through the roll to find that it was made with what appeared to be a white fish. It flaked like fish, looked like fish, and tasted like fish. Dear G-d, I hope it was fish.  Now I'm totally grossed out and will NOT eat from this location again.  I gave this review two stars instead of one because I think every place deserves a second chance (sometimes crap happens).... I just can't get this fishy taste out of my mouth, and I'm too freaked out to eat there again."}
{"text":"I love the food here and I mainly order \"to go\" most of the time. I have noticed lately that portions are getting smaller and this is the second time now that my salad was not so fresh and is a little wilted....... Okay now my negative comment is that you really need to make sure your order is correct before you leave with your order as the employees are young and don't check orders before they hand them to you. Several times I have driven home and the orders not correct or it was missing items. Lastly....when you go to pick up your order they repeat back to you what you ordered at the cash and read it so fast like you're at an auction... Slow it down please!! 
I understand the employees are young but for Peet's sake...have them double check that the orders all there before the paying customer gets home with the correct items they paid for!!"}
{"text":"Wait was far too long. After about 25 minutes they brought out the food, not only was it cold and undercooked but it was the wrong order. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The category for this place needs to be corrected, because it's NOT Asian food... it's bad American food shaped to resemble Asian food.  Regardless of what cuisine you call it, it's just not good.  The ingredients used are low quality and most of the dishes I've tried are WAY WAY too sweet.. they must put a ton of sugar in there, and it really turns you off to the dish and makes you feel horrible by the time you're finishing.  It seems they pile on the sugar to cover the taste of the cheap ingredients.  

If you're someone who downs sweet tea and thinks Domino's is good pizza, then this place will be great for you.  If you like the complexity of well prepared quality flavors/ingredients, this place will be a big disappointment.  

I guess to be more fair and put it in perspective, this place is to Asian food as Jack in the Box is to a home grilled burger."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  It took them forever to answer the phone so I could place my To Go order.  When I took my food order home, it was incorrect.  So I called the restaurant only to be put on hold for 15min, with employees picking up the line on occasion to ask me to hold longer.  When I asked for the manager I was hung up on.  After another 5min. wait back on hold, I was finally able to speak to the manager.  He was nice enough to refund the price of the entree that was incorrect, however, I would still not recommend this location.  I have been to other Pei Wei locations in the Valley with much better service."}
{"text":"My friends just love this place and I find it ok. The dishes are rather formulaic and we can whip up the same things at home. When I the group is set on going here I order the pork honey-seared \"kid's wei.\" It comes with training chopsticks which are rather useless but fun. 

I do like the fortune cookies though. Crunch crunch."}
{"text":"We've eaten here dozens of times, but I'm so disappointed with this evening's dinner selection. My daughter and I decided to share an order of shrimp fried rice and crab rangoons. The rice was salty and greasy (reminded me of a cheesy Ma & Pop Chinese restaurant in East Oakland), while the rangoons were just ok. 

Being part of the PF Chang's chain of restaurant's, my expectations are higher than the norm; we don't have meal issues at PF Chang's.

This is the 2nd time eating at this particular location and I've been less than satisfied with my meal. Perhaps Pei Wei is not the restaurant for me, which is sad being as we love PF Chang's and Pei Wei is a little easier on the bankroll."}
{"text":"Poor order accuracy and customer service. Be sure to check your order before leaving. Other Pei Wei locations are great."}
{"text":"I love this Pei-Wei location.  I've been coming here since they opened about 4 years ago.  Great renovation of an old building makes for a great atmosphere.  Service is pretty good; especially the sisters who work the floor and have been there since Day 1...very sweet women and always take care of all your needs...leave 'em a buck or two, they work hard!   

Yeah, parking is a pain if you eat right at high noon or between 5 and 7pm.  I often stop on my way home from the gym and pick up take away food; much easier.  

Everything I have tried on the menu is just great. Really love their Thai Chicken and their Thai Coconut Curry ... my fave main dishes.  All 3 salads are great, and the Chopped Chicken Salad is actually way healthy when I'm watching my diet.  They just came out with some small plates; my man tried the chicken lemongrass salad small plate last night and it was really awesome.  They have a good test kitchen to come up with this stuff.  

And I know it makes me sound like an idiot, but the really cool Coke dispensing machine is the bomb.  I usually just have the Lemonade Lite, but wow...6 flavors!   haha.   good stuff."}
{"text":"Unlike other reviewers, I always had a great meal and experience at the Fountain Hills location.  However, this location is TERRIBLE!!  The ordering set up stinks, people try to cut in front of you and the staff doesn't care.  Our food all came out at different times.  The Server had a very uncaring attitude.  The rice wasn't cooked all the way.  I was not happy and thinking twice about ever coming back."}
{"text":"Fast casual type concept - order at the counter and take your number to the table. Staff brings your food to the table when it's ready. Serves wine and beer. I tried the Kung Pao Chicken with fried rice and was delicious. Better than your standard Chinese restaurant but still $11 with a soda."}
{"text":"I love going to Pei Wei... Their food is great, usually. Last time I went I ordered lo mien noodles instead of rice. I literally got what seemed to be thin spaghetti noodles, no sauce, no flavoring, nothing... Even after mentioning to manager and another employee... They were firm that was their lo mien. Yuck."}
{"text":"OK. I already know lots of people love this place. I used to go here quite a bit but got tired of everything tasting pretty much like soy sauce and sesame oil, etc. Tried their \"Thai River Noodles\" that they are hyping lately and it was so bad I couldn't eat it. Dark soy on wide noodles with overcooked mushy broccoli and a few chopped chillies on top. Big deal.
I've been to Thailand many times and there's nothing Thai about that dish and they don't eat that anywhere near the river. That is a slam on Thailand if you think that's what they eat there. Again, this place is always crowded and people love it. Great. Go for it. I won't go back. Waste of eight bucks."}
{"text":"Wait time was over 30 mins! This place is horrible and doesn't know the meaning of fast!"}
{"text":"This place is so hidden. I'm sure it would get more business if they had better signage and windows where you could see into the restaurant. It's so relaxing inside where you order your food at a counter and they bring it to your table. Its as good as PF Changs but cheaper. And it's an easy in and out. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Me and my friends were in the area looking for some grub so we stopped in. The place was packed but we were able to order and get seated pretty quickly. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and man was it delicious! Will definitely go back if ever in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Was ok. Plenty of flavor but I think I got the wrong dish. My coworkers looked great but mine was a bit disapointing. I would advise against the spicy Korean. Will be back out of curiosity."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Staff has no interest in their customers. Order was incorrect for 3rd time. Website is screwed up. Staff members standing in dining area looking at phone while customers are waiting. Just generally poor run operation."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is normally delicious. But for some reason this location messes up our order EVERY TIME. They even messed up our replacement order. The manager (if you can get through to him) is great and takes care of us, but having to call and talk to the manager every time you done out is annoying. Just get it right!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst of all Pei Wei locations for swrvice. Go somewhere else. Parking lot is way too small you can drive around forever and never find parking.  
They take forever to answer thephone. 
Today I was on hold 25 minutes to make a takeout order they never picked up the phone. I drove there, while on hold from the 303 highway. I went inside there was not one person waiting at the register the place was empty and the phone still kept ringing they don't pick up the phone for phone orders. Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Dined here last week and they have all sorts of foods and everything is ala carte; the place is a great place for all ages and their kiddie meals suit my boys perfectly. They mostly serve rice and their menu is also suitable for vegetarians since they offer a wide variety of choices. You will also feel that you really belong to the place since the staff is helpful and friendly.

So there!"}
{"text":"We use them to cater family get-togethers. Love the vegetarian dishes, especially the baked tofu- yum!  The Mongolian beef is a favorite with family.  When we dine in we always get the lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"i've eaten at several pei wei restaurants -- which are all about the same -- but i've chosen to review this one, because it's special for a couple of reasons:

- it's closest to my home
- it was after a lunch meal here that i decided i would be plenty happy if i never eat at pei wei again

this is my fifth review on yelp, and it's my first review of a chain.  there's a good reason for that -- i spend much more time and money at mom and pop stores than chains.

there's nothing wrong with pei wei -- but there's nothing really right about it either.  the recipes are solid, but the ingredients are average.  the service is acceptable, but you know nobody really cares.  the decor is cool at first glance, but it lacks depth and character.

all of the pei wei pieces are right, but when you put it all together you still end up with an impersonal chain restaurant that's nothing more than a series of business decisions, by committee.

ok.  with that said...if you've never been to pei wei, you should probably give it a try.  i'm no fan of chains, but these guys pull it off much better than most other cookie-cutter eateries. you'll probably enjoy at least your first 1/2 dozen or so experiences. the lettuce wraps, spicy korean, and blazing noodles used to be favorites of mine.

so there's another reason why i picked this location to review...it's also right next to Tott's, which is everything i imagine pei wei would be if it wasn't a huge corporation, was run by a hand-picked staff, and was paying someone's mortgage.  it's an excellent example of why privately owned, mom and pop, and smaller, can be so much better.  just try the bourbon chicken there and see if you ever go back to pei wei..."}
{"text":"Pei Wei what's going on???? Your food and quality is starting to really slide and become inconsistent. We eat at a Pei Wei at least once a week and this location is closest, but the quality of the food is starting to become extremely poor. Tonight my husband called in an order, a kids honey shrimp, a kids teriyaki, pad thai no vegs and a pei wei spicey...order to be ready at 7pm. He get's there and they are so busy he had to wait 20 minutes longer. The tea and the refill teas were empty, the beverage machines were sticky and not clean and the it was just dirty in general. Finally he gets the food, brings it home (5 minute drive) and it's all COLD!!! My noodles in the pad thai were one huge big cold chewy clump...bleck!!! How can that be if he is waiting for it and they handed it to him immediately when ready??? Something does not add up. He took it all back ... :( Pei Wei I am disappointed. This is not the first time this has happened, but we keep giving you a shot...maybe this time it will be right. Well after tonight we have decided to just give P.F. Chang's to go a try. 

Some additional things you might want to think about, When I sit in your booths and look down and can see the crumbs and crud in between the slats of the wood, I want to puke. Maybe get some compressed air and blow that out. The soda machines are always low on ice and dirty ... I will not drink from them, the stainless steel containers that hold the straws and such ... dirty!!! It makes me question how clean the utensil is I am going to use. Garbage on the floor, dirty tables and dirty doors and windows. Finally, when you are passing to-go order over to the person who is packing them up, they should not pass through the cashier area -- YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WINDOW PASS THROUGH FOR THIS -- other costumers are standing there and looking and leaning over OPEN CONTAINERS of food and it is gross! Whose to say they didn't sneeze or cough in the direction of this food that is sitting OPEN on the cashier counter. 

Get it together Pei Wei ... we have loved you for a long time, but YOU ARE SLIPPING BIG TIME!!! TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR FOOD AND RESTAURANT ... because over the past several months it does not appear that way."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want some Kung Pao chicken with noodles or veggies or even some spicy tuna rolls. What's nice is you can create your own dish with several meat options, various seasonings, rice or noodles, pretty much any way you like it. Casual atmosphere, self serve soda machines with just about any combo of soft drink you could want."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner. The cashier was very friendly and helpful with the menu. I had the sweet and sour shrimp with fried rice, and a side of edamame. The fried rice was okay. The shrimp and edamame were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Primetime Lunch hour. 1 cashier - ONE!!! Line is out the door and manager is MIA!  App doesn't allow ordering because Pei Wei is updating their app at lunch.  REALLY?  So not a pleasant customer experience!  At least the gal at the cashier was apologetic."}
{"text":"Gluten free options! It was pretty good too! Didn't have to wait too long to get my food go to but you can also eat in."}
{"text":"Do not deserve any stars. Food is absurd and disgusting and way too overpriced for the poor quality. I ordered the dynamite thai chicken. All I got was breading and no chicken the rice was sour and there was no spice.  The teriyaki chicken was dry and overcooked and if you were lucky to chicken which was far and few between. No wonder PF Changs are almost out of business. Don't waste your time going here. Go to Teriyaki Madness."}
{"text":"I went here to order my meal and it got messed up. Luckily the manager Zach helped me and my husband get our food right. We appreciate the way Zach handled the situation. I will continue to come to this location! Thank you for the excellent service and food."}
{"text":"I went here on a week night and ordered takeout.  I had not been before and asked what would be good that had chicken but not spicy and not too sweet and they recommended the Teriyaki Bowl.  It was excellent!

As I was waiting for my order everyone that worked there was super friendly and conscientious.  All the employees were super nice.  The tall gentleman with brown hair who seemed to be in charge was beyond accommodating and friendly as well.

A+ for experience and A+ for food."}
{"text":"Loved the food! I had the Pad Thai mmmmmm really good! I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service!  I like the fried rice and sweet and sour chicken!  I wish there were more of locations."}
{"text":"Food here is always good. Pad Thai with tofu and veggies is the way to go! I like that you can modify food items due to allergies ect!"}
{"text":"Beware of large crowds.  If you see a mostly full dining room and a line a few deep at the register be prepared to commit a good hour of your evening to the Wei dynasty. 

While waiting, try to get a seat facing the kitchen, which is in full view of the dining room; a dining room that is, in essence, a high school cafeteria in disguise.  (Don't be tempted to sit with the cool kids, it's a trap.  They'll only make fun of you.)  Facing the kitchen affords you a great entertainment option while you patiently wait for your food, because nothing is as wondrous as a fully-slammed, high volume kitchen.

Four to five line cooks man the woks, flinging wire baskets of meats and vegetables back and forth in a juggling show the likes of which I haven't seen since the Flying Karamazov Brothers.  At regular intervals large tongues of flame would leap up around the woks and bask the kitchen in an orange glow.  Pyro too!?  Best show off the strip!

I also had ample time to observe the food runner (is he a waiter? a busboy? indentured servant?) who was very pleasant, never letting the hectic pace of his shift dampen his spirits, and he was very kind when he told me that after my 30-plus minutes of waiting he was just informed that they were out of the main ingredient of my dish.  He offered a substitute and had no problems changing my order to \"to-go,\" thankfully, because the kitchen show was starting to get a little repetitive and I was late for my movie.

The food itself was meh-inspiring, an improvement over Panda Express, but that's like saying the Dodge Aspen is better than the Plymouth Volaré, which is not saying much, and if you're there at any sort of rush hour, the \"fast\" in \"fast casual\" goes out the window.  But if you've got a hankering for some ThaiChinapanese food at around 3pm on a Tuesday, I say go for it."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here and the blazing chicken is my favorite! I love the atmosphere and the service is great. Very fresh and high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is hit or miss, generally, but our latest visit to the Raintree location for lunch was terrible.  Let me enumerate the failures:
1. Restaurant was dark. The lights were turned off and window shades up so the lighting was really harsh. I couldn't even see my family across the table from me.
2. Food was gross. Rice had spots like mashed potatoes and other spots totally dried out. Hardly any sauce on the chicken dishes we ordered except one which was swimming in it.  Veggies in the stir fry were hardly cooked, but chicken was overcooked.
3. Restaurant was not clean.  Many tables and booths were too dirty to sit at.  The clean table we sat at had a sticky surface.  The floor by the silverware station was greasy and slippery and left my shoes sticky. The extra plates are stained - replace them already!!!
I think it's time to simply avoid this place."}
{"text":"I live close and ordered online about 5 min prior to arriving to the restaurant. They were just about to close, I paid for my order, got my drink and by the time I walked back my order was ready for pickup. The cashier was very nice and friendly! My order was warm and correct and delivered in a timely fashion :) Needless to say I will be returning to this pei wei!"}
{"text":"Today I called to place a To Go Order for my lunch. The girl on the phone was extremely rude and inpatient with me. I ordered the Caramel dish with steamed chicken, rice noodles and an extra side of sauce. When I arrived at Pei Wei it was just before the lunch rush. My order was checked by \"Kaleigh\" who was not very friendly. She had a very bad attitude. From the call to the face to face interaction I felt like placing my order was a big inconvenience. I paid for my order and left thinking what awful people they have working there. When I got home i took one bite of my order and realized it was not rice noodles. I have an allergy to the regular noodles which is why I modified my order. My stomach was in immediate pain as to how sensitive my allergy is. I drove back to Pei Wei and the same girl was at the counter. I told her that my order was wrong and I could not eat it. She asked rudely if I wanted a side of rice noodles. I declined and told her I would like my order remade as the chicken was cross contaminated. She did not alert the manager, I assume for how busy it was. I cannot emphasis enough how TERRIBLE the customer service was. I will never return to this location. I am left hoping the painful symptoms of my allergy will soon pass."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here today!  Yummy food, good service and great company.  Dana Park Pei Wei is awesome!  Honey seared anything is my fav!"}
{"text":"This place has no cups for the sodas, no clean plates to serve our food and all tables were dirty with plates. Really bad today"}
{"text":"I ordered take out and the time they told me to pick it up was 6:40. Got there and had to wait til 7:10. That part wasn't bad however got home and the order was wrong and the food was over cooked and tasted terrible. Frozen Pei Wei at the grocery store would have tasted better. I don't recommend Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. the food I thought was too greasy and its definitely not an authentic place. Only went once and not going back"}
{"text":"The other day I went into this pei wei and i had such an unpleasant visit. I ordered tofu lettuce wraps but the cashier rang them up as chicken lettuce wraps & I had a coupon for free lettuce wraps and the cashier said I could not use it because I got tofu yet I don't eat meat, I didn't notice till after I got home that they gave me chicken & I didn't get the wrap sauce that comes with it either! The manager told me i was unable to order tofu lettuce wraps and that subbing chicken for tofu is not possible (????!!!!) when i order them almost every time i go to many different locations. Also my sushi I got was put in the same bag as my hot food and it made my sushi warm and gross!! The manager I spoke to was rude and did not handle the situation the way i expected. Terrible customer service from the manager he didn't even want to refund me or offer to remake them for me just wanted to argue that his restaurant did nothing wrong. I will definitely not be returning to this location again. Not very well trained cashiers or managers! I will stay going to ocotillo location!"}
{"text":"This is the Pei Wei location I go to the most and it just so happens to be my favorite as well. Why? Well I will tell you. They have THE best tofu out of any of the locations I have been to. I don't know why the way it is cooked is so much more different here than it is at any of the other locations but for some reason it is. It almost has this crispy texture and is not white and slimy like I have experienced at other places.

I usually either get the Japanese Teriyaki or the Thai Dynamite with the tofu and vegetables and brown rice. My only complaint about either one of these is they don't put more tofu! Occasionally there will be a bit too much sauce and my rice will be swimming in it. There is always a large amount of vegetables that are always crisp and green. 

This place is close to my work so usually when I forget lunch I hop online and order my lunch for the time I want to pick it up, and probably 9 times out of 10 it will be ready before I get there. I don't think I have ever eaten in the actual restaurant before so I can't comment on that, but the take out is fast and efficient. 

See you on my next lunch break!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei has great food and super value. My kids ask to go and making them happy is a big deal when I just don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Im giving a high, the highest rating and The why is for the how they treated me as a customer. The details aren't,  in this case , important. But actually gave them the opportunity to show that me a customer one customer mattered.  I love the food its always good and of the best quality. In fact they didnt have to do what they did and i would have been disappointed but eventually got over it and patronized their business in a couple months but they made a effort to show me my business mattered. So I went back 6 days later. I get take-out and the server was gracious, helpfull and professional. We laughed and smiled at a situation most might get uptight about .This location has a great staff. Great food and management that knows about the business their in. Henderson should be proud of this business they take care of their patrons with  professional pride. Go to Pei Wei and eat, order take out, its ready in a timely manner. I recommend the food and you know how i feel about the service. We love it."}
{"text":"Last night, I was craving Pei Wei so I definitely had to go get some. I invited a friend (who has never tried Pei Wei) and we went to this location for the first time. The drive was long but definitely worth it. We ordered the Teriyaki Crunch Rolls, Traditional Chicken Lettuce Wraps, I got the small Pei Wei Spicy chicken on fried rice, and my friend ordered the small Thai Dynamite chicken on fried rice.
 
As we were getting our drinks at the awesome soda machine with a variety of different  flavors, our sushi was already finished being made! I already knew the sushi was pretty good but my friend was blown away by how delicious he thought they were. Within a couple minutes our chicken lettuce wraps were brought to our table. The lettuce was fresh; the chicken was flavorful and tasty. The chicken lettuce wraps is one of my favorite dishes on the menu. After munching on our appetizers for a few minutes, the waitress brought our two entrees to our table. The Pei Wei chicken is my favorite entree on the menu, it has a unique flavor and they made it exactly how I wanted it. No carrots or snap peas but add tons of broccoli. Plus extra sauce on the side because I just enjoy the flavor of the Pei Wei Spicy. The fried rice was quite mouth-watering and I enjoyed it as well. We couldn't even finish half of our small portions of entrees so it was great to box up to-go and save for the next day to eat! 

All in all, the staff were quite friendly, the entire restaurant was cleaned/organized and the food was great and has big portions for a low fair price. This is a location that will be visited often."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for dinner with my friend.  There was a long line  so I figured it must be good.  Wrong!  I had a basically tasteless shrimp noodle dish .  It was nothing like the Pei Wei I
Was used to in Southern California :("}
{"text":"Great service and great food, was there today had Mongolian beef and my kids had the LO mein. The ordering girl wasn't to Happy to be at work today, but that was ok the food made up for the grumpiness!"}
{"text":"This place is back to being a normal Pei Wei for those who are concerned. With that said, I'm not really sure what niche Pei Wei occupies. If I want Asian fast food, I'd rather get Panda Express which is simultaneously cheaper, tastier, and healthier. If I'm willing to spend more is rather just go to a normal Asian restaurant.

I was never a fan of Pei Wei in Tucson but decided to give this location a shot since I had a coupon for a free meal. I got a cup of the Thai wonton soup, which was fairly tasty but for 1.99 it looked like enough to fill maybe a tea cup. For an entree I tried the spicy Korean with shrimp and white rice. The whole meal was basically a flavorless morass. Two stars for good customer service and fortune cookies but would not go back on my own."}
{"text":"This review comes after several frustrating encounters. Tonight was the icing. Called to order (because online ordering is awful) and was put on hold several times without ever being spoken to. I decide to just go up there. There are like 3 people in the restaurant. The girl at the counter asks if ordering in or leaving? I say to go and she says it will be at least 20 minutes.   Seems weird since hardly anyone is there. I then ask how long is it if I eat here? She says only a few minutes. I then say so what if immediately after I get my food, I ask for to go containers? See my point?  So stupid I left without food. Other times I have gone there I have sat with my order on the counter while the teens were too busy chatting to acknowledge me. I have a longer list of bad service but my fingers are tired from typing."}
{"text":"Big fan!

This probably one of the busier ones in town and I am always in and out. I love that you can order online!!! 

The service is NOT the friendliest, but you can not go wrong with their Spicy Pei Wei chicken salad"}
{"text":"Not the best track record of being timely or accurate. I live a mile away and love the food. However, the staff regularly seems to fail to communicate together, orders take quite a while and getting an extra side of sauce always seems like a monumental task. Only leaving review tonight because an online order that said ready at 9 shouldn't be ready 15 mins late when there's two people in the place and at 10 mins late I had to tell the cashier that an order in the hot light looked like ours that'd been there since we arrived lacking one item that she called for to the cooks again and was ready in 5mins. Just can't understand how 3 orders can be so tough to make happen.... 

Love the food/ wish the people would step it up"}
{"text":"Had pad thai, i really love how it tastes like. it was really fresh and yummy. the only thing i don't like the parking, but the way the food taste like really worth to get it there."}
{"text":"This was my second visit in 2 weeks that was a terrible experience.  The first time I called my order in and the girl on the phone couldn't figure out how to do it so I ended up placing it when got there and waited 40 solid minutes for my order.  Tried again tonight with an online order. They didn't put everything in the bag so when I called I waited I  hold for 36 minutes... while driving back to the restaurant! The manager have me a $10 gift card
.. No apology sms no comment on why I would have been on hold for 36 minutes. Too many good restaurants to waste my time there ever again"}
{"text":"I always like this place, but today my foods taste really bad and I have a stomach ache. I feel like  going to barf plus the cashier messed up my order substantially. This place is normally better. Our waiter also have our food to the wrong table 3 times."}
{"text":"2nd time in a row take out order is missing items. Ordered lettuce wraps and no lettuce. 

Grayhawk Pei Wei is poorly run."}
{"text":"Food is good. Do not go to this place after 8 PM, even though they say they are open until 10 PM. They cook the food on one side and other side they clean the cooking area walls with soap water by standing on the top of other cooking ranges. it is clearly showing that soap water drops from sponges falling down where the food is getting cooked. Not a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Very good, and very fresh. I really enjoy Asian food, and this hits all the check marks. Join the rewards program to get free meals."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the world for Asian food.  I LOVE the chicken pad thai.  I get in 99% of the time I go there.  

The food is always fresh and the staff there are great.  They won't precook anything so there's a little bit of waiting if the place is busy, but if it's busy you know it's good.  Lots of people are lovin' it.

I would have given this 4.5 stars rather than 5, but I didn't see that option.  The reason is that they won't alter the order even the slightest bit.  I've asked them to leave off the green garnish on top that I always throw away anyway, but they won't.  I thought it would have saved them a little bit too.  Also, you can't alter the spiciness of the food either.  It comes how it comes, but it's always good.  That's why I upped it to 5 stars in spite of this little quirk of theirs.

I love sitting outdoors when it's not too stinking hot outside (this is AZ after all).  I've gone there on dates, with my children and grandchildren, and anybody else that likes this place.  My sister was visiting from out of town and we sat there for 3 hours talking after dinner until the place closed.  Everyone was friendly and didn't try to encourage us to leave earlier.  It was a great place to hang out.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had dinner here Friday night and as always, it was excellent. We have never been disappointed with the food or service here. It is one of our favorite \"go to\" places. It is quick, reasonable and you can customize your entrees."}
{"text":"I ordered two Pad Thai this afternoon. One for me and other for my 8 year old grandson. I wanted them to be mild. They ended up being extra spicy and hot. My grandson, who loves Pad Thai simply cried. The taste was not good. Chicken was old and smelly.

I immediately phoned them. The man was so rude at the other end, he simply said thank you and cut the phone off.

We made a mistake of going there again after six months due to bad experiences in the past. But not any more!"}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei, never been to one I didn't really enjoy the service and quality of the food!  I actually prefer Pei Wei to PF Changs!"}
{"text":"I have eaten their food for years now at several locations.  It usually tastes the same at all. Decent

Today, my noodles were burnt. If I were to imagine what a melted plastic fork would taste like, this would be it.

I stomached thru a few bites before doing the unthinkable.  I sent it back.  If an employee had not come by my table and asked if all was good I would have finished eating and left.

The crab rangoons were good and I really like the chai vanilla tea.   My replacement meal was of the normally expected quality.


I think today they had a bad chef.  My friend that went with me said his meal sucked too.



I will eventually eat their food again but it won't be my sugestion to go.


One possibility for the bad food could be this.  Two cops (police officers) were dining there too.  Perhaps we got their meals instead.  Many fast food places have a reputation of messing w/ cops orders.   Who has seen Super Troopers???"}
{"text":"If you have an oral fixation that manifests itself in the form of a diet coke addiction, it is worth going to this location for the beverage dispensers alone. I was very impressed by what they got goin on."}
{"text":"Don't bother going here. Way too slow and food is no good. Spoke to the manager and she didn't seem to care at all. Go to the closest Panda Express instead. Way better and much quicker."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning - April 10, 2015. I ordered a chicken entrée but the person who took my order confused it and they made the wrong kind of chicken. (Sesame instead of honey seared.) I offered to take the wrong order since it was made but, the guy at the counter insisted it would just take a couple minutes to make the right one. When I got home and ate it, it had a hair in it, which was kinda gross, so I didn't eat much. But, since the chicken was apparently undercooked, the little that I ate was enough to give me a nasty case of food poisoning, which I still have the remnants of 3 days later."}
{"text":"I usually visit this location on a Tuesday as I am in the area. I almost always order the honey seared chicken with fried rice. Tonight this entree was on the dry side but the fried rice made up for that. I also received an unexpected extra meal with a nice note that said Just Because :)"}
{"text":"I have been sick for over a week now & was not in the mood to cook last night so I placed an online order & had my hubby go pick it up. I got our usuals; edamame, pork egg rolls & honey seared chicken with white rice. New items we tried were; crispy potsickers, mandarin kung pao chicken (mild) with fried rice & a cookie (they didn't run out this time!). The reason I dropped a star was because I gave my hubby that $10 gc that I had received about a month ago & they told him he couldn't use it. WTF, why not?! He said they didn't give him an explanation & I'm sure he was just in a hurry to get out of there. Next time I'll go pick it up myself & if I am able to use it, I'll give them back their star. If I'm not able to again, then idk if I'll be back..."}
{"text":"They made a small mistake on our order for which they went above and beyond to fix it. It was more than necessary and unexpected. The Kung pow chicken is great!"}
{"text":"This location is always busy, but I can't understand why.  Tried this Pei Wei's again this evening after a long hiatus, and was very disappointed.  Both my honey-seared crispy chicken and the wife's sizzling beef were over-cooked, tough and dry, and even tasted burned.

I usually get the brown rice but tried the fried rice this time.  It was the high point of the meal, but is also weird because it is made with red bell peppers, scallions and carrots.

For this high price, I expect better cuisine than Panda Express at closing time."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent portion (take home half), hot and fresh and yummy. Employees friendly and on top of it. Despite being dinner time rush, very little wait. We too are pleased with the size options. Love the spring rolls, Pad Thai and salads. One of our favorite restaurants which appeals to my husband and I as well as our picky kids. Rewards program is an added bonus."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's authentic or not because I'm just a white dude from Phoenix. \"Pei Wei\" could mean \"American Sucker\" for all I know, but I know it's damn tasty and kids like it too. It's fast and the food always tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Terrible service waited for 20 minutes to receive my food.... getting my brother a refill and asked for a water cup the manager accused me of stealing a fountain beverage because I was refilling my brothers drink BEYOND the word of ridiculous and then he verified with multiple cashiers and told them to add the drink to my sisters bill who was order so RUDE finally to add insult to injury he came by the table to make sure I was drinking water!!!!! While all this was happening there was a guy eating a large plate of sliced oranges that are intended for the ice tea NEVER AGAIN WILL I RETURN!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I can't see my review that I spent 10 minutes articulating so I guess I'll just wrap it up in one small summary. Pei Wei sucks ass. Everything is relative and comparable right? Well I've eaten at great authentic Asian restaurants in the valley and it just seems absolutely obvious to me that Pei Wei tastes like straight dog shit... My girlfriend and I feel shitty and lethargic right now. Why? Cuz we just ate a bunch of shitty Pei Wei food. What did we order? Who fuckin cares. Pei Wei sucks ass. Spend a couple extra bucks and go to an authentic family owned Asian restaurant and I guarantee that it will be better. Not some corporate food chain bullshit."}
{"text":"First time ever giving a review but felt it was necessary. I'm just gonna go all in and say it... Pei Wei sucks ass. It seems to be subjective, I know. But in comparison to legitimate Asian food, wheather that's credible Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc., I'm not sure how anyone can make a compelling argument that Pei Wei is \"good\" food.. The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place. Spend a couple extra bucks and go eat some authentic Asian cuisine at a family owned restaurant that actually knows how to cook real food.. Not some corporate food chain bullshit.. Thank you for reading and bless your heart."}
{"text":"They ruined our neighborhood Pei Wei.  We used to do PW once-a-week.  Loved the food and everything else about the place.  Unique flavors that we couldn't find anywhere else.  We finally went last night after the new \"Market\"  opened.  I like the idea of the smaller portions. I can even deal with the new limited menu... But what used to be fresh food, wok-seared and served extremely hot is now pre-made and warmed up then plopped into a plastic dish.  Then you get to find your own plastic utensil to eat with.  The people that used to work there that we saw on a regular basis are now different employees, and with no customer service (bordering on rude).  The new seating is uncomfortable, and the ambiance is non existent.  We will never go back.  For 30 cents more, and a drive over to 44th & Thomas, we can get twice as much food, that is served well (and HOT)  by people who act like they care if we are happy eating there.  

I understand this is a pilot restaurant to compete with the fast food joints.  If I want that, I will go to Panda Express.  Pei Wei, you are making a HUGE mistake.  Bad move!"}
{"text":"Great affordable Chinese. The scaled down, casual dining experience of PF Chang's without the huge hit on the wallet. Granted, not the full menu, but a good portion of the stuff you'd want anyway. Two egg rolls, four potstickers, and an entree with two drinks runs us $22. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Always consistent with food quality, good value,  We often do pickup with Pei Wei to bring back home and enjoy as a family when we don't feel like cooking. 

not much to really say, not a big fan of the pork egg rolls, they are a little heavy and greasy.  oh and if you do order them, make sure to ask for sweet and sour sauce, they do not come with it by default, they come with spicy mustard.  

The honey chicken is always a winner for the kids, and the Mongolian beef is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"Food is good and consistent and the service is always great. I've never dined in, but get take-out fairly often. I love being able to just say \"same as last time\" when I call it in. Not as good as PF Changs, but certainly better than most other Asian-ish places in Surprise. Be aware that they use shitake mushrooms is almost everything, but they are fine with custom orders if you don't want them. All in all, it's not my favorite place, but I always enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"A great meal quick!  Quality is as good, or better, as their parent PF Changs.  Friendly staff make the experience even better, very happy people.  

Portions are just past normal size.  I really like picking up an order of chicken fried rice.  Lots of yummy in the big bowl.  Sesame chicken is another favorite I get regularly.  The spice is just right, hot enough to compliment the dish, but not send you into a coughing fit.  

Bottom line, I've never had a bad experience at Pei Wei, highly recommended, even if you have to drive across town to get there."}
{"text":"I came to eat here with my family and asked for spring rolls that we were told are all vegetable so we ordered some. (My family and I are vegan) so as I bite into my roll I realize there is chicken. When I point it out to an employee he tries to tell me it is rice noodle and I point out to him the rice noodle then the chicken then he goes oh yeah it's chicken like it's no problem even though I expressed our dietary needs. Then he goes and grabs someone from the back which I can only assume was the manager and he makes the situation worse. Just saying over and over oh yeah idk why they did that, then at some point says something along the lines of he's not going to make fun of us for choosing to not eat animals and giggling about it. Now twenty minutes later I'm feeling sick I don't know if it's from the food or the frustration but I will never step foot in there. The situation was handled so poorly I refuse to spend my money there and be made to feel like my dietary needs are no big deal."}
{"text":"Yes yes, it's a chain, but it's pretty darn good. They have consistently good service here on Dysart, and the place is always immaculate. There is this young, dark haired front register kid who works there frequently. Give him a raise! He knows all about the menu, always smiles, and has a great attitude! I actually am starting to prefer the food at Pei Wei to their grand daddy, PF Changs. If Pei Wei added some egg drop soup to their menu, I'd never look back."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Hector made our experience 5 stars. Very welcoming and was always attentive. Give that man a raise."}
{"text":"If I can rate this place 0 Star I would. This place is beyond words to describe. The food was terrible, horrific...They don't  know how to cook!

The service was not better.

Trapping in the airport, you don't have much of a choice but avoid this place if you can!

You are warned."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch at least once a month & they're always great. The portions are filling, my shrimp, chicken, & wontons are always cooked/fried to perfection & they aren't stingy with vegetables"}
{"text":"I had my lunch there today, I know there aren't a Japanese or sushi restaurant. But I still order there spicy tuna and mango california roll and they are always good. Service is fast so it's good when you don't have a lots of time for lunch time."}
{"text":"The Thai coconut curry is GREAT. If you like Panda Express give Pei Wei try. Better quality food for a few bucks extra."}
{"text":"I ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Thai Wonton Soup as take-out.

Service was quick and ahead of schedule--no complaints there. 

For about $14, this was an adequate dinner that was enough for lunchtime leftovers the next day.

The Thai lettuce wraps were quite good. Chicken was a little dry (maybe due to lack of fat--not all bad). It was actually better the next day once the flavors melded. 

However, the \"Thai Wonton Soup\" has not one ounce of Thai flavor. If you have the flu, get the soup. It's essentially an extra brothy chicken noodle soup. The name is misleading. The wontons are fine, nothing to write home about. I would have expected some thai basil or something to jazz it up. It had a minimal amount of floating greens, but these flavorless morsels added specks of color and nothing more.

I've tried many things at Pei Wei and it is adequate chain take out, but I go about once a year and that is enough for me..."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good. I like the soda machine they have(with the customizable drinks). Price was fine. Portion was plenty. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened. We ordered take out tonight and the quality was terrible. We were all very disappointed"}
{"text":"This place stole money from me, how do I give zero stars? I placed an order online and it did not send me an order confirmation but said my payment was processed on the web page and the charge appeared in my bank account. I arrive at the Pei Wei to pick it up and the blonde girl there says she has no order for my food in her system and that since I didn't receive a confirmation email that means the order didn't really go through. I show her my bank account that it was clearly charged and that I want a refund then. She says that was a pending hold and it will disappear the next day. Well, five days later and my money was most definitely deducted from my account. Thanks for stealing Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge Pei Wei fan, but the past few times we've gone there--especially last time-- I've been EXTREMELY disappointed. 
I go to Pei Wei for the spring rolls and the chicken lettuce wraps. We usually order for lunch, so their lunch combos were always great because they came with an eggroll or spring roll. But recently they've changed their menu so I ended up with Pei Wei Spicy Beef combo which, per usual, had chewy meat, not enough sauce and too much rice. I also ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and let me just say STAY AWAY FROM THESE! It was such a confusion of flavors.. it was tangy and there was the hint of cilantro and mint... MINT! Gross! My boss took one bite and almost puked, he's a bit picky so I tried it and almost puked as well. We also ordered the Steak Lettuce wrap which was gross too. Super disappointing. 
This place is way too pricy and now that they've essentially eliminated the ONLY thing I like there... they can close up shop as far as I'm concerned.
I'd prolly eat here again if it was thee LAST place open and McDonald's has exploded. But for now, if I never eat here again, it'll be too soon."}
{"text":"Normally this location is good. My family and I haven't been for a while. Tonight i picked up an order with 6 little pieces of orange chicken and like 5 pounds of rice. I got ripped off and I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst customer service not friendly at all they don't answer the phone when you call 
Hope someone from company try to call them as a customer and find out what kind of people they hire"}
{"text":"I've come here several times and they're always overwhelmed because it is such a popular location. There's a crowd of customers and they just keep walking in the door. This cuts into their customer service but not because the staff is wanting, but because they're stretched thin. You can see them hustling and going at it with energy! They do smile and serve with gusto - four stars for that!

The place is clean, has a great ambiance and they move the line along at a decent pace. The food is ok. The dining area view of the street is cool."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is not close to the real pad Thai.  Do not order Korean BBQ bibimbap.  They call it fusion, but it is more confusion!  Sorry could not resist...
But the most disgusting thing were the colony of flies congregating in the window on the rear of restaurant!
Chef joe"}
{"text":"Asian Ribs, yep you'll wanna pass on those unless you like bones with asian five spice powder, no need for actual meat, you won't eat them anyways.  These went great with my white rice dish that had some dry chicken and paper thin carrots as a garnish, the peanuts were fantastic, they nailed that!  Lettuce wraps were just okay but after the other culinary delights it was hard to feel we got our $32 worth.  Someone wrote Chinese food meets Subway, couldn't agree more!"}
{"text":"The food at Pei Wei is very good, especially for the money spent; this restaurant lacks acoustics within the restaurant, very difficult to have a conversation. Con: tables are never cleaned and set up properly!  Food gets a FIVE; Cleanliness gets a ONE."}
{"text":"Disappointed because Ive been spoiled by the Surprise takeout.  We always order Asian chicken salads and get a nice healthy salad that actually has chicken with the wontons, silverware and even a fortune cookie.  But at this location, you get a small salad and little chicken, crumbs of wontons (couldn't believe it) and no silverware or fortune cookies.  I went back a 2nd time to see if it would change and no, still crumbs of wonton, little salad and little chicken and not even a fortune cookie again.  Guess I'm spoiled by Surprise and will stay there."}
{"text":"pf changes but faster, right?  decent prices and pretty good food.  not paying for the crowded atmostphere of course, but the food is really consistent so if you find something you like (which you probably will) it is a good consistent chow hole..."}
{"text":"I debated giving 1 or 2 stars.  I decided on 2 because the employees/service/atmosphere is definitely a plus.  In particular I found the employees to be very helpful, friendly and fast.

But the food just isn't very good.  The menu descriptions sound exciting and make me want to try every one.  Unfortunately the dishes are overly sweetened to mask the fact they are missing any real flavor.  So you end up with a dry and tasteless dish.  I have tried 3 different items and came away with the same impression on all of them.

I will wait a few months and see if they make any changes before giving them another chance.  The prices are fair and service is good, so if they figure out they need to improve the food they might be able to turn it around."}
{"text":"Considering they are an affiliate of PF Changs the menu items are different and unlike PF Changs.  The food is good and fresh and the atmosphere is cool but it still trails their predecessor.  They do a lot of take out business which is understandable because the parking is rather small considering its a shared lot with multiple other businesses who compete for parking."}
{"text":"The problem that I have with this place is not the food or the workers. It is the other diners that come in here. Multiple times I have sat in this establishment and watched as countless entitled, privileged, smug suburbanites come in and act like they're the freaking Kardashians, making ridiculous demands of the servers, running the poor kids who work there around to get them things they easily could have gotten themselves before sitting down, only to leave my food sitting there getting cold. It cracks me up to see some of these Chandler/ Ahwatukee Douchebags come in with their heads so firmly inserted in their rear ends. PEI WEI IS NOT PF CHANG's. Though it is owned by the same company, they are two different styles of restaurant. Pei Wei is essentially the fast food version of Chang's. So if you in fact, ARE a Kardashian  floating above the rest of humanity and want someone to wait on your every beck and call, maybe you should go to PF Chang's. And if the people at Pei Wei are running themselves ragged to take care of you, maybe it wouldn't hurt to leave them a buck or two in appreciation when you leave since I'm sure that they aren't making much more than minimum wage. Maybe if you did this, the place wouldn't be \"going downhill\" as I've seen some of these people claim....Because after all, who wants to clean up the three tables that you and your five kids just destroyed for minimum wage?"}
{"text":"You have one job! That's to pack up people's order & take their money...and you screwed that up! 
I ordered online so she didn't even have to TAKE my order, thankfully...because who knows what I would have found in my bag. Smh
I left the store only to get to my destination (Coronado High School) & I realize we don't have forks!!!! I deserve some blame because I should have checked, but COME ON! Do your job right!"}
{"text":"Barely 2 stars...inconsistent on quality, portion size, service is marginal at best, and just not worth it unless you just want brown rice, veggies are skimpy, and protein is usually fried.  Last time I took our order back, paid cash, and wanted a cash refund...nope, can't do that sorry, but will give you gift cards...really?  I would pass, better off you going to chipotle next door"}
{"text":"I just went here tonight and was disappointed that this particular location has the Spicy Korean dish off of their menu. I've been to other Pei Wei locations before and absolutely love the Steamed Spicy Korean Steak on brown rice. Because of that, I went for with something new. 

Tonight, I had Steamed Honey Seared Steak on brown rice. I chose this dish, because I like garlic sauce, scallions, and red bell peppers that it comes with. I never had rice sticks or had honey mixed with the sauce before. So I was curious how this dish would taste. It was pretty good.

The service was spot on and quick. I would go here again, but next time would ask if they have the Spicy Korean dish still available. Next time, I would change it up by getting Steamed Spicy Korean Chicken on brown rice. 

I'll update with what the experience was."}
{"text":"Good food but pickup is the worst disorganized restaurants ever.  Prepare to wait at least 30 to 40 minutes during the rush hour.  I order it online and I still had to wait extra 15 minutes.  They hire teenager that don't have a clue.  No one knows who the manager is."}
{"text":"This place is really fresh. I ordered teriyaki steak with fried rice and every ingredient on the rice was 100% fresh. It tasted amazing. I also had ordered mango California rolls and they were great as well. The only issue I had was upon entering the cashier wasn't really helpful for a first timer like myself. We had to figure the menu out ourselves. Other than that, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pei Wei Sunday with the kids is something we do a lot. And this location is the closest. Went there a few Sundays ago, and despite the fact that we go there all the time, it was the last time for sure. The girl at the register was obviously unhappy, and ruined my desire to give this establishment anymore of my money. She should work for the post office, or be a telemarketer. If you hate your job that much, you should look for another one. Management: you should be aware of this, and correct that. Now we are going to the one on Baseline in Gilbert/Mesa, where service; yes, service in a Pei Wei, is very good. They care, they pay attention, they are happy to see and serve you. Anyway, the Wok salad was good, which explains the One star; but bye bye Pei Wei on Guadalupe and Mc Cormick, you will never see me again."}
{"text":"I'm blaming my sister for this one.  She claimed this was a similar version to PF Changs (or so someone lied to her).  It's faaar from it.  This is fast order quasi-Asian style that tastes worse than the grocery store deli version - and that's faster and better tasting than here.  I think the pricing is obsurd for what they're calling fresh food (\"fast\" doesn't mean fresh).  It was bland.  
I had a spring roll, Vietnamese style with two sauces that did not improve the flavor.
I also tried my kids California rolls and a teriyaki something.  Something was up with the rice - overcooked, overprocessed?  I don't know but we all agreed this was not up to our par that we expect for sushi (all items are cooked, sort of Korean style but that's a stretch too).
Finally after everyone else at the table was already finished with their food, my sister's \"spicy\" bowl chicken something came out.  It had waaay too much scallions (not even diced ir chopped; halved pieces), the chicken was battered so it was more like flavorless nuggets on a HUGE portion of brown rice and she asked for vegetables, which was what she picked at.  I tried it since she was making a weird face, it wasn't spicy, more tangy sweet and really heavy with all the carbs.
$40 later we all left unfulfilled and went home to nibble on other food.  Message me if you'd like my opinion on better nearby sushi bars, Vietnamese or Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Thursday May 25, 2017 Against my better judgment, I called and asked for Lauren, a manager. I waited 5 minutes because she was in the kitchen! No problem, I said, I'll wait. I explained to Lauren that I wanted fried rice with chicken with extra extra ginger. I asked if she remembered me. She said yes. She advised that I order the ginger broccoli because they'll make the fried rice with \"ginger broccoli sauce\".  I even said to her \"so I'm going to get fried rice with ginger and broccoli?\" and she said \"yes\". I get home. I start to eat, not only is there no ginger flavor or actual pieces of ginger, there's no broccoli!! No, I did not pay for it. I wanted to pay for it, but now I'm glad I did not. I thought that by asking for Lauren and speaking to her the matter would be resolved. I am now convinced that this has got to be the WORST and most INEPT Pei Wei in the city of Phoenix. I have never had this problem with any other Pei Wei I go to. I will be Yelping this time. I just cannot believe how absolutely INEPT and how absolutely difficult it is to put extra ginger in rice. If you cook, if you shop produce, you know the kind of ginger I am asking for. The kind that you actually chop up into little pieces, not just \"ginger flavored sauce\" because, believe me, there was no ginger flavor!! I'm done! I am DISGUSTED. I even took the rice back to her....free or not.  Maybe someone with a brain will actually taste the rice and understand what the difference is between \"ginger flavored sauce\" and real ginger. And I know that Pei Wei uses real ginger because I don't have this problem in any other Pei Wei in Phoenix, in Glendale, in Scottsdale, just this restaurant!! How can you be a restaurant manager and not know the difference between \"ginger flavored sauce\" and real ginger! I am so upset that I am going to contact the corporate office. I will find the number or the email address for the corporate headquarters of Pei Wei to report this insanely INEPT Pei Wei...that's how upset I am! If there were another Pei Wei in the vicinity I would not go to this one. I will even travel to the Pei Wei on 7th Ave and McDowell before I ever step foot into this INEPT restaurant. I think the owner thinks that because he participates in Arcadia high school fund raising activities, the quality of the food does not matter, or the experience of the managers do not matter. He is highly mistaken! I also believe part of the problem is that all the cooks are Mexican and do not speak English!! I'll be reporting this too, and I am Hispanic, so it is not a racial thing...it is an INEPT restaurant manager(s) and lazy owner thing. If your cooks don't speak English and your managers don't speak Spanish, there's a problem! I have witnessed the confused look of the cooks when the counter person has to explain extra extra ginger! Rachel, the other manager was just as useless!! Many other reviews with low ratings!

Hi, no thank you, Mr. Pugh.

This has been a repeat issue that has happened the last three times I've placed the order, even asking and going into great detail about the order and my past experiences, to the teenagers running the restaurant. Who knew adding ginger to fried rice is such a difficult request for a cook?

I'm so dissatisfied with the owner/management/manager(s) of this restaurant that I will no longer support this business and will share my experience on Yelp as well as with neighbors and friends! 

I do NOT want ANOTHER gift card as an attempt to rectify the situation. Free meals do not work with this level of incompetence!

Sincerely,

{"text":"I love this place...but I think my most recent visit could have been better. The food was not as good as it was last time I went. Staff was very friendly and the service was fast. Love it!"}
{"text":"Portions have increasingly become small and the quality of the food has deteriorated. We have been eating here for several years. After receiving \"hot and sour soup\" that tasted like Campbell's beef stew we decided to call the manager, who's name is \"Tawni.\" I explained the portions of the food were small and the soup was horrible. I pointed out that we spend at least $30-$35 every time we order out from this restaurant and expected much, much better. She was only mildly apologetic and DID NOT offer any compensation of any kind. Calls and letters to the corporate office are a total waste of time. They do not return calls nor do they want to speak to unhappy customers. Stay away from Pei Wei or at the very least, from this location!! They are only interested in profits."}
{"text":"Just dirty ... Sometimes I wonder why we come back here. At the register the girl handed me a cup. There was particles of food on the inside. I handed it back and said \"It's dirty, I'll take a different one.\" She put the dirty cup back with the other 'clean' cups. I stopped and restated \"No. It's DIRTY, you probably shouldn't give it to someone else.\" (Shaking my head)"}
{"text":"Usually this place is super busy but we got lucky today. We came in for an early dinner around 4:30PM, and there wasn't many people around. There was also a new item on the menu: Polynesian poke bowl. It was sooo good! You get three different types of protein in the bowl: ahi tuna, spicy tuna, and California."}
{"text":"I have been back again and again, they are still awesome.  Every time I go or call in an order I vow I'm going to try something different and every time I order the same thing.  One day, I'll try something other than the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken.  

Their take out is very well run, they know who I am when I call and they even know what I want, it's always ready when they say it will be and it's always hot when I get it home.

That said, eating in is always best, not sure why but the food just tastes better on a plate than it does from the plastic container."}
{"text":"Difficult accessibility. Atmosphere is stale. Food is ok but, not worth the price."}
{"text":"I order the new Japanese Steak and Shrimp bowl.  Big mistake. Hardly any steak...maybe the size of a value menu McDonalds burger. 3 mini shrimp. My pile of noodles was huge.
Bummer. This place is overrated."}
{"text":"Pei Wei has a great selection of Asian cuisine, select from various meats, including shrimp, and your choice of brown/white rice or noodles.  Their latest offering the Japanese Beef Chile Ramen is a great new addition to the varieties offered and another sign of their commitment to quality food."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style dining. Fair to good food. You don't need large portions when ordering unless you share. Suggest grabbing a table before ordering or you may find yourself with no where to sit."}
{"text":"I love the Kung Pao with chicken. The Fried Rice with Chicken is excellent too. The food is excellent. Decent sized portions too. Once of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I love this location but the parking is sparse. The food is always fresh, the staff is attentive and nice. They have plenty of seating but I usually take mine to go. There's a separate door and parking for to go orders and they're very quick with your order. The menu always has new items so it's worth checking in once in a while. You can also place your order online to speed it up in a pinch!"}
{"text":"Went in thinking it was the usual Pei Wei, big mistake. The food was close but no cigar. Not sure what they were thinking..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Pei Wei and will continue to eat here. I find it is better to stick with what you like when ordering however. I went for lunch over the weekend, and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals, especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area, so we are going out to eat quite a bit to try new places! 

We have been here twice and the food just keeps getting better. This time, I ordered Mongolian style steak with white rice. The meal was excellent. I had enough to take home for another meal. 

We also ordered a spicy tuna roll which was pretty good. We would like to try all of the rolls that Pei Wei offers in the future. 

The menu offers so much variety. We can't wait to try everything.

Great job! See you again, soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. This place is clean, the staff is wonderful and go out of their way to help you. They stay a step ahead of you and get what what you need. 

The food is perfect! I have eaten here many many times and it has always been fresh, hot, and delicious! I highly recommend this place, 100%!"}
{"text":"I used to go here once a week for their gluten-free PW spicy. But they changed their chicken to thin little slivers.  It is awful. I'm no longer going."}
{"text":"This was horrific. Flavorless and lacking any character. I had the Orange steak, marked as spicy, almost no flavor. I got a tiny bit of heat and only tasted orange if I bit a piece of rind. The rice was seriously overcooked and blown out. Also had the Hot and sour soup, No hot no sour, only what appeared to be a gelatinous gummy mass from too much corn starch. My roommate opted for the chicken fried rice. All you could taste is salt and oil. She also had the egg rolls. Once again the predominant flavor was the cooking oil. I really did not even have high expectations. Just Chinese takeout. I expected oil and salt. But really Pei Wei has raised the bar on how poorly simple dishes can be prepared. The staff was about as would be expected at this price point, nothing to write home about. Unfortunate really since the restaurant space was nice and clean as well as appropriately lit and appointed. I definitely will not be going back and likely will be guiding friends away from this establishment."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They lost my order and took 30 minutes to remake it. Do not waste your time coming to this poorly run establishment."}
{"text":"They no longer have the shrimp lo mein that I enjoyed but they do have chow mein which is OK too. It's always good but it could cost a little less for what it is. I obviously don't go there very often but I'll continue to go maybe there's something even better  that I haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"When I placed my order, I should have known that it was not going to be a good experience.  After paying, the cashier told me to tell her when my order was ready that she owed me $0.73.  Since I paid in cash, she didn't have any change to give me.  Then, after waiting over 20 minutes to get my food, it was mediocre at best.  I ordered the Fried Rice Chicken and it was overcooked."}
{"text":"I love their food. I have gone there multiple times and still think it's great. I especially love their soda machine.  The Mongolian Beef dish is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"The wonton soup is absolutely delicious! The Thai basil makes the difference. Their spring rolls are also great and anything that has Pei Wei on the menu is a must-try. If you're a vegan or vegetarian their tofu is delicious. It's nicely seared and well-seasoned."}
{"text":"Been to two of their locations ........ The closed Fountain Hills ...... Which was terrible.

                 AND This One ........ Which Thus Far Is .........TERIFFIC

The staff at the ordering counter were competent and loudly repeated back your order to avoid errors.

The food quality ....... was outstanding.
The Taste .......... of our chicken dish was Delicious.
The Other Entree .......... was a Steak dish which was also Enjoyed."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had. So I ordered on the phone at 7:50 which they said it was going to be ready in around 20 min. So I arrived and paid at 8:00 and was standing around for my order. Finally after 15 min I asked how much longer and the lady said they are making it now. At 8:25 the lady came up with my order that wasn't even my order. I told her my name and she looked at the counter and my bag has been sitting there since 8:05!! I was waiting for 20 min for my food that was ready and sitting on the counter the whole time. The lady felt bad and handed me a $10 card.  But"}
{"text":"The food was typical Pei Wei,however the restaurant was filthy. My husband was even grossed out! The table appeared to be clean but was super sticky and the restrooms were filthy."}
{"text":"Note to Manager: food is great, however, answering the phone is terrible. You really need to train staff or at the very least, turn the ringer back on. I have called multiple occasions with never an answer, most of the time its around 6pm-6:30, so I think ok your busy. Now again today, Sunday 2:15, called and no answer just a continued playback. I come to the location, place my order, inform staff I have been trying to call and no answer, they apologize. 

Now as I sit in the chair, waiting for my food, I call you 4 more times to only see the faceplate light up notifying of an incoming call. No answer any time, staff was in the cashier zone and not busy. 

I would suggest maybe you'd make additional revenue if the ringer is turned on your phone and staff answer it regularly. 

In about 20 minutes, when I'm done eating, I'll forget about this as I'm really upset because I'm starving. Again, food is great, quick to deliver, but the call in order stinks. 

Kudos to the chefs and the clean environment at 67th Ave/Beardsley Pei Wei!!!"}
{"text":"A very good meal and generally inexpensive. It's not greasy and always tastes fresh here. Some of the employees are a bit ditsy but in general they are all very nice and accommodating. The manager Chris is very nice, huge on customer service, and always willing to fix any issue you have quickly, and efficiently. He's great! The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is relaxing. We usually always order pickup and even though it's very busy we never wait more than 45 minutes max for our order."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei. I eat here all the time. This particular restaurant is always clean which makes me feel good about eating here. They use fresh ingredients and the food is very good. I have probably tried everything on their menu and all of it is good. And it's reasonably priced. You get a ton of food. I always have left overs. Great food, clean and friendly staff. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the food and atmosphere of this place. I've never gotten a bad dish and the prices are great...but the last few times that I've gone to this location for take-out the staff has been short and unfriendly. I understand that it's busy, but it is definitely a major turn-off. I will probably have to try a different location in the future."}
{"text":"I give them two.stars for effort. Ordered quinoa and instead got carrots, edamame and a sprinkle of quinoa. I was looking forward to the new quinoa since their rice portions are astronomical. Skip Pei Wei and support local, independently owned Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  The service was very good.  The food was served relatively fast.  And it was very good.  I had the pad thai, the wife had the oranged seared chicken and both were fantastic.

The daughter had the California mango rolls.  I'm not a roll fan but these were very good!!

I'll definitely come here again"}
{"text":"The Sweet-and-Sour Chicken was good. The Fried Rice, however, gave reason for concern. There were several clumps of burnt rice, indicating that perhaps the rice was left without movement in the pan/wok/whatever-they-use for some time. One of the staff members at the online order pick-up counter was unacceptably surly to myself and gave major attitude to another patron. The other staff member at the online order pick-up counter was nice, though."}
{"text":"The food is Okay. Not great, not terrible. But I think for what they are charging it should be better than okay. Also the tofu tastes wierd. I think it could use more flavoring. The orange chicken is very spicey, almost too spicey to not even enjoy it. The sweet&sour is good."}
{"text":"Complete and utter chos here tonight. We wait 30 minutes for our food. We were not alone, everyone in the restaurant was upset with waiting and wrong food brought to us. The tables around us were getting 1 plate at a time being brought out. Saw several people going up to the counter complaining. Bad night here, first time at this location. Never had problems in the past."}
{"text":"This place still sucks. you don't serve a meal one entree at a time with 5 minutes between each one not to mention the appetizer coming at the end of all of that. Do not recommend eating here again this is the second experince bad enough to render and negative review in my yelp existenc"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I normally love Pei Wei but this location left me underwhelmed! My Pad Thai was so dry, I couldn't finish it without putting my chili sauce for my egg rolls on it."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. Mongolian beef, edamame, and sushi rolls are all excellent. From what I heard this is a sister company to PF Changs. Whether true or not, excellent food. Love the orange slices they offer for your iced teas."}
{"text":"So this review could've went downhill but the management team definitely restored my faith in good customer service. I came here to have lunch with my co-worker and ordered lettuce wraps and wontons. My wontons come right away and her food as well but to my surprise no lettuce wraps. So me not trying to make a big deal just go ask the front of they new what was going on the manager then comes and let's me know he'll get them for me and give me a full refund which I insisted was not necessary. He still did it. I think the food is awesome but the customer service went above and beyond anything I was expecting!! Thank you guys so much you rock and I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences we've had at any Pei Wei. The food was good but what really ticked us off was the manager. It seemed like one of the registers was down and they were having trouble. The manager was doing nothing but standing around at the front, watching one employee juggle the line while he ate fortune cookies. Extremely frustrating to watch."}
{"text":"Good lord, why can't this chain get much of anything at all right?

1. When I order something for a time over the internet, I expect that the food I ordered will be ready at that time. Its been a long day, a busy day, and to have my food delayed 10 to 15 minutes past when I was scheduled is a major inconvenience. I order online versus going in and ordering to avoid people, hassle and wasting my time. Yet somehow this concept eludes them and my time is not of a priority to them. 

2. They put beef in the bottom of my girlfriend's dinner. Now with past girlfriends this might not have been an issue, but my special lady friend does not eat beef in any form. While this sucks for her, its more concerning to me. I have a massive and acute allergy to all fish products. If I would have eaten something that had a piece of fish or shrimp hiding in the bottom, I would have been direct to the hospital. As much as I might enjoy chain eatery Chinese food, its just not worth the risk for me to eat at a place that while touting \"if you get it with veggies and tofu its going to be VEGETARIAN\" and then have them mistakenly put meat in the bottom.

Long story short, if you have food allergies or if you're in a hurry, I'd skip this place. The food isn't good enough to venture the annoyances of dealing with this place."}
{"text":"I work right next to this place and I've been here a bunch of times so let me tell you what the deal is.

A lot of people complain about this place because they say \"Ooh the cashier was unfriendly\" or \"Oh the food wasn't like an asian master would prepare\" well no kidding you big drungus, it's because you're at Pei Wei and it's like a fast food place if you wanted authentic asian experiences you screwed up already.

Pei Wei is where you go if you want a bowl of noodles or rice and you want some stuff on top with a sauce.  Just order it and move down the line and if there's a table then sit at a table or maybe take it back to you office.  It's just food.  This location is pretty average in terms of speed and politeness, and the food seems to be cooked appropriately so what else do you want?

Here's my PRO TIP: When you go to the place where the drinks are right after you order, get a fortune cookie, but slip it into your pocket, then at the end of the meal, go back and say outloud \"Oh man I am going to get a fortune cookie\" so they don't think you're taking two and then swipe a second one and eat it there.  They've got the most delicious fortune cookies and even though the messages are usually something stupid about sports like \"Oh you're gonna have a good sportsball game tomorrow\" you can still enjoy the cookie, and you've already swiped a second one to enjoy later so you're the real winner - sportsball or not."}
{"text":"Good food, but the parking situation is horrible. Try to avoid lunch time during the work week, but if you need your fix during the rush it's best to call ahead or place your order online."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite to eat. I always go with the Carmel chicken and fried rice. It hasn't failed me yet. The only downside is that the parking is pretty tight and it gets quite busy around dinner time."}
{"text":"Picked up an order to go today for lunch for my family. Got it home and dug in, only to find long, dark hair in one of the meals.  GROSS.  Called the restaurant, explained the situation, and all they did to \"fix\" their problem was to not charge us for that one meal.  That's not making up for the mistake, Pei Wei, that's just not making us pay for food that never should've been served in the first place.  If you want to actually MAKE IT RIGHT, more would need to be done (comp more of the meal, gift card, just... SOMETHING). My husband ended up going without lunch due to everything.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I eat regularly (3-5 times a month) at Pei Wei, usually in Scottsdale or North Phoenix. My wife's doctor is across the street from this Pei Wei, so we have been stopping in when we go to her baby check ups. It is, without a doubt, the best Pei Wei I have eaten at. It is consistent, they don't get frustrated if you customize your order, and the cooks on always on point. 

Wish this location was closer!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place for quickie food. Feels like a good variety for what they serve. my fave are the lettuce wraps because they're not quite so spicy. Some of the foof can be too salty, but I'll admit my tastes tend to be bland. quick service. it's a good standby"}
{"text":"Clean, Fast service, Inexpensive. Great food.  One of the chain restaurant I dont mind going to."}
{"text":"I have eaten Asian food all over the world and I don't usually eat fast food but I love the food here. Its always fresh and the servers are friendly and great. Always ask if you need chili sauce or condiments. You can preorder on an ap which makes it convenient for pickup. You can customize your order to make it spicy or healthy. Swap rice for noodles or lettuce. Steam the protein. Add extra vegetables. Plus it has a great reward program where you can earn points for future meals. This will continue to be my go to Asian restaurant when I am in Phoenix,"}
{"text":"This is pretty good. My wife and I usually split lettuce wraps and an entree of some sort. It's convenient to be able to order take out online. Overall, if I'm really in the mood for chinese food I'm going to make the drive a little further out to Big Buddha on Greenway and the 303, but this is a good substitute as it's about 1 minute from my house."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying this 5 star review is for MADI. The other staff I hadn't had a chance to see or they just had a very demeaning vibe. This place was first introduced to me in California (no idea which city). I'm not saying Madi is the only great worker this specific location has, but tonight she's the only one who didn't have a stick up .......you know the rest."}
{"text":"We now drive from fountain hills to Raintree Pei Wei...yes it is often crowded but having eaten at Pei Wei at least 200 times the food is consistently greAt!  We love the Mongolian Beef, the spicy chicken salad which has loads of chicken, the lettuce wraps, and the teriyaki bowls."}
{"text":"Most disgusting restaurant experience thus far! My husband ordered me a salad, I didn't finish it so he finished it up for me. At the last bite he asked me if I was chewing gum. No, I wasn't as he pulls out a chewed up piece of gum!!!! 

Someone on staff spat their gum out in the salad and it ended up in my husband's mouth!! 

DISGUSTING!! DON'T\"T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY, PASS IT ON BY!!"}
{"text":"Disappointment! I have been a huge fan and loyal patron of Pei Wei since they came to the valley. We don't go as much as we used to, but a few weeks ago we ordered take-out. I asked if they would include both a mild and a hot sauce for the lettuce wraps and I customized a kids meal. When Dave brought our food home the first thing we noticed was 2 fortune cookies for three meals. Ok, maybe I shouldn't complain...but come on! Then the kids meal had barely any meat, another disappointment. First, I dove into the lettuce wraps, which they only provided one sauce - not the two they said they would provide. However; the worst part was my meal, I had the Mongolian beef...a dish I usually crave from them, but my meal was so salty I couldn't even eat it! It was absolutely horrible! Again, very little meat in the dish. Sorry, but I think you lost a customer over this meal!"}
{"text":"Food is really fresh and good. We have been coming here as a family for many years as it is a great way to get the kids to eat vegetables.

Menu changes periodically to keep things fresh and new. My personal favorite is Pad Thai noodles with vegetables. The chicken lettuce wraps are similar to Parent company, PF Chang's."}
{"text":"I like that location. Anytime I ordered by phone they are very nice . Pei Wei is my second kitchen. My favorite are Kung Pao Shrimp and noodles"}
{"text":"We have been to Pei Wei a few times now and it has never disappointed. My favourite is the poke bowl, the perfect combination of spicy fresh tuna, soft fluffy rice, crunchy vegetables and lettuce and spicy ginger dressing. My boyfriend have tried Asian chicken salad and mango steak salad, both were delicious. Overall it's healthy and tasty, it has become one of our regular places for dinner now."}
{"text":"Great food and service.
Honey seared chicken is a delicious option.
Awesome location. Very quick!"}
{"text":"I like the their noodles but not a big fan of the sides. I prefer more original style myself, this is more corporate."}
{"text":"It was okay. Their fried rice was a little too greasy and I did not really like their crab rangoons. However, they did have really good vegetable egg rolls!"}
{"text":"By far this is the best place to get to go. The employees are amazingly nice and very helpful. (I recommend the orange peel chicken on noodles. A classic!)

It is also a nice place to sit an eat in the afternoons. It's super relaxing, quite place. The food comes out quick and exactly how you order. 

Just an added plus, they have one of those soda machines with all the different types of sodas, which is amazing.

Overall and amazing place with an amazing staff!"}
{"text":"Asian food that tastes little like authentic Asian food -- even less than something like a PF Changs, I can't say I was impressed. I won't be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is like a fast-food version of PF Changs (same owner/recipes). There is something that is a MUST for anybody trying Pei Wei for the first time: Lettuce Wraps.

Absolutely worth the trip alone. I normally get this for myself as my entree, and my fiance likes the Honey Chicken. Both are excellent. I've also tried the Pad Thai, and it was just 'ok'. The dumplings were above average, but as stated, the thing to get is the Lettuce Wraps.

For a chain, its pretty good. The food has always been hot and fresh and flavors are great. I LOVE their Ice Tea as well. Service is always fast and courteous."}
{"text":"I won't be back to this location anytime soon.  I called in a LARGE order for 10 people to take to my Mom's birthday party.  I knew there was going to be a problem when it took me 10+ minutes to place the order over the phone with the manager Lupi to get the order repeated back to me correctly.  I stressed that this order needed to be correct and that I wasn't feeling that it would be and I had most of my family at this party.

When I arrived at the store I was assured by the manager Lupi that my order was correct and it was bagged up and ready to go.  I should have made them take it out and re-bag it in front of me.

After getting the food out at the party I discovered they had forgotten my mother's favorite dish and the thing I specifically ordered her for her birthday dinner.

Irritated, I called the manager Lupi back and complained that something was forgotten after we had spent an extensive amount of time going over and over the order both when I placed it and when I picked it up.

Lupi did promise to spend me a gift card for the mistake, but it didn't really cover the botched birthday dinner or the amount of time spent repeating the order to make sure they would get it right.

Save yourself the hassle and order from PF Changs, that is what I plan on doing next time."}
{"text":"Slow service, however when I got up to get a refill the waiter already removed my plates from the table. I confronted him and all he did was say sorry. I didnt bother to go talk to a manager since I didnt care about the taste of the food. Cold warm hot and sour \"soup.\" Hard california rolls, you can tell its been in the fridge for a while. Half assed put together chicken chow mein. Cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty busy whenever I go, but they are surprisingly fast for made to order food. I order the chicken pad thai and add plenty of the red chili for a nice kick. The traditional thai lettuce wraps are also worth trying."}
{"text":"What a joke. Worst meal ever. Not sure if they were just off this time or they don't care. Tofu burnt and dry. Lomein chix was deep fried breading, no meat.  Overall terrible."}
{"text":"Best take out Chinese.
Everything I have tried is delicious! 

Honey seared chicken is the best!"}
{"text":"First time. Thai rice bowl terrible. Take out. No utensils or napkin. Called manager she said it was my fault.  First time last time. Too many options out there"}
{"text":"PF Changs faster less expensive sibling. Great size portions for the price and still fresh and tasty. Online ordering for to go orders and a rewards card - yay!

Korean BBQ is great, and good kids options too."}
{"text":"The best part about Pei Wei is knowing that everything is absolutely fresh. Veggies are crisp and light, meat is juicy and cooked to order, and rice is cooked well in industrial rice cookers throughout the day and night. All flavors are elevated due to freshness. Doesn't get much better! 
I will agree with the bit about inconsistency; I do think this has to do with nothing being pre-cooked, and find the inconsistency to fall on deaf ears since the cuisine is so well though out."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, I am surprised to see comments that the food is \"healthy\"..  My first time there, I ordered the Spicey Chicken Salad from the \"lighter side\" menu.  Nothing in the list of ingredients suggest it is sweet.  When it arrived, I was surprised at how sweet it tasted.  I decided to look up the nutritional information on Pei Wei's website.  Shock!  990 calories (one of the highest on the menu, only Spicey Chicken salad with Steak higher at 1,140), 111 carbs, 85 grams of sugar, 44 grams of fat, 80 mg cholesterol, 2090 mg. sodium.  I had already taken a few bites but left the rest.  It wasn't even very good.  How does an item with the highest  amount of calories make the \"lighter side\" menu.  Service was ok, gentleman asked why I didn't eat it.  He said \"was it too sweet\" so obviously they know.  He offered to make something else but nothing is very healthy there so I declined.  Those of you who think you are eating healthy better think again.  Check out the nutritional information on their own website.  I will never return.  On my husband's dish, the rice was cold and the steak was just ok."}
{"text":"Love their dishes, wished they could have add a little more baby spinach and wonton to their wonton soup. Always my go to place whenever I get hungry."}
{"text":"I don't normally write negative reviews and I normally don't review chains, but I have to say, this Pei Wei, at least, has gone down hill. My family just ate here the other day and the food was not good. We had the honey seared chicken. It was soggy and had fatty pieces in it. We also had the lettuce wraps. The lettuce was junk lettuce. What's going on Pei Wei? Are we competing with McDonald's now?"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a good dinner for the wifes bday. She placed the order 50 minutes before the scheduled pick up. Still had to wait 25 minutes more once I got there. The customer service, or lack there of sucked. It was good food, but won't return to this one because of the service."}
{"text":"Great choise for fast food"}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all with this specific location of PeiWei, I ordered my food in advance and came in the time I was told it would be ready and of course I was prepared to wait a few extra minutes but I wasn't prepared to stand inside the restaurant for 30 MINUTES after the 15 min time period I was told my food would be ready in, you could tell the staff was very young and unorganized the cooks were fine, the food was great, but I could see about 4 Togo orders ready in the window and there was about 6 people waiting, crowded by the door waiting for their food. The only reason I'm giving any stars is because the cooks managed to make up for the wait time"}
{"text":"Very good food and super friendly staff. Ihas the hot and sour soup and spicy chicken rice bowl.  Ihave paid three times more for worse food!"}
{"text":"Ordered using the app tonight, we had a 35 minute wait, so we arrive to pick up only to hear they have no record of our order. We order again and wait an additional 35 minutes. While waiting another person arrived to be told the same thing, no record of his order!"}
{"text":"I love this place i'd recommend it to anyone ! We always order it togo and it never disappoints! The food always taste fresh and is always ready on time! Definitely our favorite lunch spot !"}
{"text":"Listen.  I'm going to get flack for giving Pei Wei 5 stars....along with farm-to-table restaurants, and home-grown family owned hole-in-the-walls with 10x's more charm and character.  But sometimes, you just gotta have a fast, guilty pleasure, fake Chinese food meal, and I have no problem going to Pei Wei for it. 

Perhaps Pei Wei holds a special place in my heart, because I ate it all the time living in Kansas, among all the casual chain eateries.  It's reasonably priced, and super consistent.  Entrees can come with brown rice, which is a huge plus.  This location's got a Freestyle soda machine (strawberry Sprite Zero anybody?) 

TIP:  Check out their website/FB page for deals, like BOGO diner select entrees.  (Diner selects are half the size of the full entree, and include a side like wonton soup or an egg roll.) 

TIP #2: Lunch is crazy busy with all the businesses nearby with workers in need of noshing.  Plan accordingly for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"I generally like Pei Wei and stop at this one frequently on the way to something in the neighborhood.  The food is okay but for two-week in a row they have had NO white wine at all, only cybernetic, and tonight when I agreed to the cabernet, they had to go wash the wine glasses! Standards are slipping badly - hope it isn't true for all Pei Wei locations."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. I was ordering online and told to pick up at certain time. When I get there, I had to wait for another 30 minutes. I began noticing something was not right when the people that came after me got their orders  while I'm still waiting. I finally asked them where's my order, so the cashier looked, come back and says \"oops, it's here all this time\"...?!! I was beyond frustrated. This has been ongoing issue, either the management needs to revise its training policy or add more staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Apart from the roll-of-the-dice service it is overall a fantastic place to eat. Prices are great for the quality of food. The only caveat is if you don't like the Scottsdale persona... Don't come here. This place is frolicking in them. The myself attitude is unbearable. I had three people jump in line in front of me. Then there is 'that' guy/lady who doesn't know what to get so they sit at the cashier pondering what life decision to make. Anyway, great food, great prices, horrid location."}
{"text":"Waited 28 minutes for a salad before rush hour. Three other guests got their food! This is the second time this has happened. I'll never ever go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Glendale location today. It had been quite a long time since I'd eaten at Pei Wei. It's not the same quality as it was when it opened. In the beginning...the food was barely second to that served at a PF Changs. It was quite good, easy to access and everything that accompanied the food was higher quality (drinks, napkins, fortune cookies, staff/bussers).

I ordered a small chicken orange peel with brown rice ($6.49) and my BF ordered the large shrimp kung pao ($9.99) and we also ordered 2 side spring rolls $3.79. I believe the smaller portion option is new to Pei Wei as I'm sure they're trying to capture a larger market w/less expensive prices or portions. For lunch, the small is just fine for most, especially if you get an extra little side with it. 

BUT...HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SMALL AND ORIGINAL PORTION SIZE..YOU PAY MORE FOR ADD'L RICE WHEN YOU ORDER THE ORIGINAL, NOT ADD'L MEAT.

Plate next to plate my BF had the same amount of meat (shrimp) in comparison to my (chicken)...his plate was larger and it had more than twice the amount of rice on my plate. So comparing apples to apples you pay $2 to $2.20 more for MORE rice, not necessarily more meat when you order an original vs a small depending on what kind of meat you order. 

So...Just wanted to give you the heads up when you consider ordering small or original."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go when you want something quick but don't want to put fast food in your body. This is quality food without spending an hour and a half getting a meal. They also add a seasonal or new dish quite often so there is always something new to try. Think these would do well in CA. They should expand."}
{"text":"PF Chang's Lite.

Pei Wei reminds me of picking a Chinese restaurant for takeout.  Is there really that much of a difference?  It doesn't really matter which restaurant you pick...the dishes are going to taste about the same from restaurant ot restaurant.  Pei Wei has good tasting food...but there isn't anything distinct or mind-blowing about their offerings.  I wouldn't say you shouldn't go here and I wouldn't say you should.  It's good food, not great food...so my mom won't be hearing about it any time soon.

Try:  The Pad Thai (pretty tasty)

Avoid:  The large portions unless you're really hungry"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place.  Love it. I use don't care for Asian food, but I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"F U Pei Wei sucks if you ever go there out of desperation. Check your contents before you leave the restaurant because they don't know how I fill an order to save their lives"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this peiwei  location at all meaning the one on 67th Avenue near the 101 last night they left out half of our order and then the manager try to make amends by offering to mail me a $10 certificate that would know where cover the costs of the items they omitted. The supervisor's name is Juan. If you end up needing to speak to a manager I would go above his head to the general manager I believe his name is William because Juan doesn't seem to be able to perform addition. Anyway long story short they ruined our dinner last night and I would suggest highly going elsewhere if you're into Chinese / Asian thanks for listening to my rant hope you all have a super weekend."}
{"text":"Great convenient location for my favorite Asian food. The food is generally good the only thing negative I have to say is sometimes the tofu can come out soggy but most of the time it is crisp and delicious. My favorite dish is the sesame chicken with fried rice. The staff here is always friendly and they have freestyle coca cola machines at this location! Would recommend for anyone looking for fast, fresh, and tasty Asian food."}
{"text":"The food is always great. Jimmy the manager always remembers us when we come in.
The servers are always friendly and eager to help."}
{"text":"I don't know why so many restaurants are determined to make me take my takeout business elsewhere, but now Pei Wei is on that list. Maybe people have forgotten what the point of take out is, convenience. Ordering my food more than an hour before I need it, then waiting 40 minutes after the promised time to get it is ridiculous. All the girl taking orders would say is \"I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.\" Perhaps this wouldn't have been so bad if there weren't like 25 other people in the same boat as me...waiting for their takeout. I did notice that there was no back up in the dining area of the restaurant. They were all getting their food on time, eating, and leaving as I continued to wait. I wasn't offered a discount, or a gift card, although I did notice that many people around me had been comped or given a $10 gift card for next time. Apparently Pei Wei doesn't want me to return.  Consider it done, I will be taking my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Pei Wei and used to frequent this particular location. After a recent visit I find things have changed. No comfortable seating. Sticky tables. Mistakes on our order and the food was not very good. Oh, and others seem to know ... there was no one else there."}
{"text":"Been going to Pei Wei for 10 years, always like the food but they have slipped. Always felt the place was clean, but now they are slipping there also. The gap between the two tables slid together is dirty, foods grains, etc. Need to wipe the sides, not just the top. Dust and dirt under some noticable areas is unkempt. The hanging vents over the woks is as dirty as ever. Nothing is stays the same, but the lack of trying to maintain is showing up. To bad."}
{"text":"Customer service when taking my order was good- the gentlemen behind the counter was attentive. 
The food on the other hand- 
The tofu in our dish was grouped into clusters and burnt! Upon explaining & showing this to the cashier, we were given a refund but NO apology. They're so busy that quality seems to have gone out the window. 
2 stars. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The staff here is great and they're nice,  wonderful and quick. People were ranting in raving about pei wei, I had to try it.  Even good yelp reviews.  I'm highly dissatisfied with the flavor of the food. This  should be labeled Asian inspired and not Asian. I've tried a variety of Chinese restaurants, this doesn't taste close to anything I've had at other Asian restaurants. Their Mongolian beef  was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us. Neither me or my husband enjoyed either of  our dishes.  We didn't even eat half of our plates.  We even refused to take it home with us.  If you like and enjoy what typical Asian food tastes like,  don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I came to pei wei to have some nice sushi, but did I get sushi? No. I show up, order my food, like you do in most situations, and there's a wait. That's okay, I get it. A restaurant like this is going to have a wait. Here's the kick, I sit down in the waiting area for 45 minutes. 45 whole minutes of my time waiting on this sushi that I have been craving all day. Finally, they come up and tell me- oh we're out of sushi. I just wanted some sushi guys, so you can see my dismay. So I got to leave the building with the drink that I bought, but not the actual food that I waited forty five minutes for. Absolutely rubbish."}
{"text":"Five stars because, as far as \"fast\" Americanized Asian food goes, this for me really is as good as it gets.

It's made to order, unlike Panda Express, and you can expect some actual meat in your breaded chicken, unlike Pick up Stix. It's quality. Yeah, it's a little more expensive than those places, but if you can spare the couple dollars, it's worth it.

The Mongolian beef is my favorite. It's always full of flavor. This trip, the flavor was phenomenal. Before we moved to Henderson, we frequented Pei weis in Orange County, and while it was typically good/great, occasionally this dish would be overly salty. Yet this is the second time in the Vegas area that I've been blown away by how perfect the flavor was--once in Summerlin and now here (and we haven't been here that long).

The meat today was a little fattier than I'm used to here. Hopefully it will be better next time, but it won't stop me from coming back. If anything, I will return in the hopes that the sauce will be as tasty as it was this trip.

The Bf's Honey-seared chicken was pretty good too."}
{"text":"So my wife and I were are on a typical date night and craving Pei Wei so we decided to head on down to the Dana Park location. We entered knowing that Saturday night is a busy night for them so we were planning on a wait. At first everything seemed fine and then we ordered and I got a feeling that the girl who took our order just didn't care about anything just wanted us to hurry the heck up. She didn't welcome us or even make eye contact. Then we went to sit and couldn't find a clean table outside so we had settled for the one that was the easiest for us to clean. The customer service must have been just out the window for them tonight. Then we received the food extremely fast, all at once. We ordered lettuce wraps, chicken fried rice, orange peel chicken, and Kung pow chicken. The lettuce wraps were really good but shorted on some wraps so off to a ok start. Then we started with the Kung pow which tasted burnt or \"like they made it with their butt\" as my wife says. The orange peel was okay not good...just okay. The white rice on both entries was hard and felt like it sat around for a while before being served to us. Then last but not least the chicken fried rice, which was good. I wish all of the entrees were as good as this.  I hope they improve the customer service on the weekend. I know that it is busy but would it kill your servers to be happy and at least pay a little attention to the customers? As a customer I know it's going to take longer for food to come out and I wish our food would have took longer to be served because I know if it had came out a little slower the cooks would have put a little more heart and pride into what they are cooking rather than just shoveling crap out. I guess we will have to try this place in another 6 months. Maybe. (Just cause the fried rice was good)"}
{"text":"Call in an order for pickup. They say 25 minutes. I show up 20 minutes later and pay for my meal. 2 people order to go orders behind me. Both of them receiver their order before me. I go up to complain. No one seems to care. And to top it off my order was never even in the line to be made. I ask for a refund. Don't even get an \"I'm sorry\" terrible customer service"}
{"text":"Went there today. Have been there before. Table and floor dirty. Out of tea. Food was terrible and portions very small. About a third portion. Rice ok. Only a very few pieces of vegetables. Could count the tough meat on one hand. Will not go back for a while."}
{"text":"Bummer! This is Kung Pao Chicken - take out with extra chicken for $1.99 extra.  It's pretty much a regular sized order!"}
{"text":"Cheap and almost as good as pf changs, quick service and the food is always hot and fresh, Mongolian Steam is the best."}
{"text":"It is so bad that I have to sign up Yelp so I can tell people not to waste their money.  I ordered two take out dishes: Thai Dynamite chicken and Korean spicy beef.  My verdict: a notch better than Panda, but cost the as much.  I am Asian.  My opinion of Pei Wei: go there if you like American Asian food.  If you like something a bit more authentic, go to Asian Grill on Alma School and Riggs, only 5 mins away from Pei Wei.  Cheaper too. Mind you, the restaurant is not good looking like Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food at this restaurant.    I found a piece of the plastic rice bag in my food.  I was told sorry this happens sometime when they open the bags.  When they brought my new dish of orange peel chicken it was was bland and not impressive at all.   The other person in my party had to return their meal of pad tai because it was so salty you could not eat it.  They remade the dish it was still salty and no flavor.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone but if you do go make sure you check your food for foreign objects."}
{"text":"Great food quality and awesome flavor. The portions are a perfect size for dinner and a little leftover for lunch tomorrow. I'm obsessed with the steak pad Thai! True it can get a bit on the pricey side but it's so worth it over going to a fast food Chinese place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp.
Food was seasoned well, large portion - couldn't finish it all.  Good service and good food!!"}
{"text":"Been there twice in the last two weeks and each time they are slow as molasses when ordering. Once I ordered online for pickup at 11:15am. I show up at 11:15 to the take out counter and wait almost 10 minutes before anyone even greets me at the take out counter.

The second occurred last night (Friday night). My wife and I showed up at 6:30pm. There were approximately 15-20 people in line when we arrived. After 5 minutes of waiting, the line had moved one person. At that point I could tell they only had one person on a register at 6:30pm on Friday night!! Insane, considering that's one of the busiest times and days of the week. We walked out and won't be back..."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant on numerous occasions food is always made wrong no matter how you call it or order it in person. Young man with black hair very rude cashier.  Management never around or if he is he never will address a problems. Spoke with a J in manament very unprofessional didn't care ask to speak with owner to see if he knows what is going on in his restaurant was told on vacation till after chrismas. Food is never made the same they always for get the sauces or screw them up.  Bad experience. Given them so many chances. Save your money"}
{"text":"This location shows \"Test Kitchen\"... Not exactly sure what they are testing, but if I order something off the regular menu at this location the ingredients are poorer quality compared to the other locations. I ordered an Ahi Avocado Salad- which I've had multiple times in the past at many other locations. 

First of all, I placed my order online. When I went to the restaurant to pick it up, the younger guy behind the register was pretty rude and not at all welcoming. He asked for the name the order is under, when I provided it he couldn't find it and asked me again... Still couldn't find it. He rudely asked if it's under a different name, I checked my email confirmation and replied no. He implied I must have ordered from a different location... I did not... So then he decides to check by phone number, then states the name the phone number pulls up like it's a big giant confusing mystery when in actuality it's the same name I gave him twice before... It's a common name... Learn to spell. 

My order is not ready yet, but he doesn't give an estimated timeframe, he just processes my payment and walks away without saying anything and without giving me a cup for the drink I purchased.. 

Once my order is finally ready, I take it to go and then realized my $7.99 plus tax salad is a great big bowl of iceberg lettuce... It's never been iceberg in the past when I've order the same exact thing from other locations... But not only is it the cheapest lettuce available, it's also wilted. Nothing else was fresh either. Not using the \"Test Kitchen\" location again."}
{"text":"Food was brought to table very quickly, staff was friendly and efficient, and my kung pao chicken was piping hot and enjoyable. Not top notch in the flavor department, but far from bad. Also, Pei Wei's has the coolest soda fountain around, with about 2 bazillion soda flavors. The place is clean, and the restrooms are well-kept. And despite all the complaining about parking space, at 6 pm tonite (a Saturday) there was a couple of open parking spaces. 

And this is probably the safest restaurant in the city of Phoenix - there was 8 uniformed Phoenix Police Officers (and god knows how many detectives!)  in the dining room this evening."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Got the pork dumplings which were great. Also got the orange chicken with white rice. It was wonderful and I was super hungry so I got a side of noodles with Mongolian sauce. The meal was fast and very moderately priced. Everything I got with water to drink was about $13. The orange chicken tasted exactly like Pf Changs for half the price. This was my first time eating at pei Wei and it was wonderful. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this Pei Wei. They give you good portions and its always hot, fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"We normally love Pei Wei but tonight was not good on so many levels. First, they kept delivering the completely wrong meal to our table and by the time they figured it out the other 3 people had been waiting 10 mins with food ready to eat. Second, one of our meals had hair in it. Very gross. The overall meal wasn't as good as it normally is and just felt different. Sad to say that I can't get excited to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have eaten at other Pei Wei locations and have been satisfied.  However last nights purchase of four entrees was very disappointing.  The Dan Dan steak entree was so overcooked I think they mixed up our order with the nursing home order, you couldn't even bite the noodles, they just mushed in your mouth.  The teriyaki chicken was also overcooked, totally dried out and without any sauce on the meat or veggies.  To top off the insult, only 2 fortune cookies came with our order of 4 entrees, is the economy so bad we are sharing fortune cookies now?"}
{"text":"I had never even heard of this place and when my cousin described it as a \"fancier Panda Express\" my expectations were kind of low, but I was extremely surprised. So surprised actually that we ate here twice in one day! 

We had the Mongolian chicken and crab rangoons. If you love crab rangoons this is the place for you! They come with a very good sauce as well! The chicken and rice were awesome as well.

Come to Georgia! I will eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Been going to them for years! Always great food, could use some extra cleaning here and there for faster seating especially on busy nights but overall a great bang for your buck"}
{"text":"Love the food. Hate the sushi. Stick to what works. Sushi was a great concept but poorly designed. Don't like the new look personally. Still enjoy the food. Lettuce wraps are the best"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the Asian chopped Salad...haven't been here in awhile! It was horrible... Not chopped... Hardly any chicken and the lettuce was frozen"}
{"text":"I am usually very satisfied with my Pei Wei experience however today that was not the case.  To start with we noticed a sign to receive 20% off our order by signing up via facebook.  My wife signed up on her phone and received a code.  When we presented the code to the cashier she would not take it and said we needed a bar code, strike one.  When we received our food the vegetables were severely under-cooked, strike two.  Then when tasting the two spicy dishes we ordered they were sweet and not spicy at all, strike three.  I am very dissatisfied with my experience and am very doubtful to return.  Most coupons can be redeemed from mobile devices these days.  It is better for the environment, cmon Pei Wei, get on board!"}
{"text":"We visit this Pei Wei location frequently. It's right along our running path so it's convenient to finish our run there and then have dinner. Tonight we ordered take out and we're so disappointed when we got it home. My husband's meal had 4 pieces of chicken, mine had 5. There was hardly any sauce, even the rice directly under the chicken and veggies was dry. We've never had a meal this disappointing from Pei Wei. 

The lady at the checkout didn't say anything when I walked in, she just stood there looking at her screen. I thought she was putting in an order or something. I had no idea she was ready to get my order and have me pay until I asked her.

Two stars because they did get our order correct."}
{"text":"Eh - used to be really good. But everything seems to have gone by the waste side. Service is poor and quality has really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Soooo bad. Service is poor and food is just as poor. Don't know what happened to this company as their other restaurants also suffer from poor food and service."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE pei Wei.  It's my kids favorite.  We came tonight to get the dan Dan noodles and I got the original size.  It was barely a kid size.  I honestly hardly got any food at all.  For 10 bucks I really expect more.  I am going to stop on the way home and get something else because I'm still starving.  They must've REALLY cut back on portions, seriously... It was a joke how little food I got.  I Definately WILL NOT be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The beef coconut curry is awesome! Love that they are a division of PF Chang's, but without the sit down waiting experience. If I want great Asian food, I definitely eat here!!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is good Asian food. Everybody can find a suitable dish, even vegetarians. The brown rice is perfect every time. The chopsticks are made from quality wood. The napkins are huge and thick. I only wish they would bring back the scallops!"}
{"text":"Staff forgot to include an item for carry out service.  We called to discuss this error,Server became defensive and promised to have manager call.  He never did, I called and spoke to him.  He assured me he would issue a credit, did not do this either.  Spoke to their home office, and this amounted to a long winded excuse.  Eat here with the assurance the customer is never right."}
{"text":"Just boarded so I haven't tried the food yet, but the service was absolutely terrible. Rude workers who have no business working in the food service industry, especially in an airport! I ordered between flights and I had about 20 mins to order food before boarding, so Pei Wei, right across from my gate seemed like the obvious choice...Fast forward 25 mins later, when I had the gall to ask if my food was coming up because my flight was boarding, one of the workers said it takes 10 minutes after I order to get my food. Bitch, I've been waiting 25! And you work in an airport where people are constantly running to catch their flights, especially connections!  After FINALLY giving me my food, they had the audacity to mock me saying things like, \"you know, it'll take at least 30 minutes to board that flight\" and \"serve me now because my flight leaves in 5 minutes!\" They were speaking to each other and if my flight wasn't boarding, I would have had fighting words. They clearly never fly because if they did, they'd know you want to board as soon as possible to, not only get settled and not have to wait in a long ass line, but to make sure you can stow your carry on! Assholes!"}
{"text":"It is Pei Wei...there is not much to describe or tell.  The food is salty and oily, but that should be expected.  The price is good for what you get.  I like having the to-go option."}
{"text":"This place never ever brings our food out all at once. One of us is always done eating before the other person gets their food. Last night we went and this happened. Then when they brought my food, it was wrong, and did not even taste all that great. I also had to tell them twice that both drink machines were out of ice, before that issue was addressed."}
{"text":"44 mins to get two kids teriyaki bowls sesame seed chicken.... The place has gone so down hill.  Bummer!!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki beef a shoe sole. 
Shrimps mostly bread covered with sweet sauce. 
Ordering from the website easy and food ready at pickup time."}
{"text":"I know that it is Asian fast food, but it is just too sweet for me.  There are too many other more authentic Asian fast food restaurants in the area for me to bother coming back here.  And if I am specifically craving American-style Asian food, then I would probably go down the street to Tott's."}
{"text":"Typical fast food Chinese place. The food range from okay to decent. The place is not well managed and is often filthy inside. Tonight we struggled to find a clean table to sit and there was hardly anyone there."}
{"text":"Couldn't agree with Scott P more, \"what were they thinking?\".  After the remodel they now have just a handful of the menu items they used to have.  And the portions...maybe about half as much as what you'd get at a normal Pei Wei and at what seemed like a higher price than before.  I paid $10.33 for Mongolian Beef w/ Noodles and no drink, just a water cup, only for it to show up in a plastic container on a tray like I had just grabbed a meal at a hospital cafeteria.  And it's not like they brought it out to me either;  had to disrupt my lunch conversation (which I was only half listening to because I was listening for my number to be called) to go pick up my child-sized portion of food.  

I love Pei Wei but definitely not ever going back to this one."}
{"text":"The location at Dana Park clearly is the worst run out of all of the Pei Wei restaurants. I ordered the steak and mango salad. This disgraceful \"salad\" is enough to make mankind stop eating vegetables. For a staggering $9.00 you get iceberg lettuce, slivers of mango, a few tomatoes, very little cheese maybe a few more unnoticeable ingredients and steak.....Steak? What is this? The mystery meat is more like beef jerky. Much to my disappointment the geniuses who run Pei Wei have adopted the business model of Taco Bell and continue to run this once wonderful eating experience into the ground."}
{"text":"I like eating healthy, so this is one of the places I stop for Lunch, I like the seasoning, the rice, tofu and the veggies they have. no waiting, good service, clean inside.Last saturday I could find a place to park close enough"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at Pei Wei MORE than PF Chang's. I use all my PF Chang gift certificates here :)

The menu is smaller, the portions are a little smaller, so are the prices, but the food is sooooo much more flavorful in my opinion. They have vegetarian and gluten free options. 
Pei Wei is \"casual\" dining - order at the counter, take a seat, they bring the food to you. Get your own drink refills but leave your table as is when you are done, they'll clear it. I usually leave a little tip :)

Our favorites:
Crab Wontons
Hot & Sour Soup
Honey Seared Shrimp
Pei Wei Spicy Chicken
Thai Dynamite Tofu or Vegetables

Never had a bad meal here, and never left hungry :)"}
{"text":"I am sometimes baffled when someone tells me they have never heard of this place.  Get your head out of the sand!  Jees!  Pei Wei is a favorite of ours and we visit quite often.  This is a fast food - version of PF Changs and you are missing out if you are a PF fan.  From all that I have ordered from Pei Wei I can honestly say that alot of it is similar recipes.  Our favorite waitress RENA makes our dining experience just THAT much better.  She litereally knows everyone who walks through the door and greets them with open arms.  She is the epitomy of customer service.  We love her!!!  Make sure if you visit and run into her let her know you heard about her on Yelp!  ;)

Last nights dinner - on the patio mind you - (Love) starting with crab wontons which are always perfection sitting on top of a plate of a sweet and sour kind of sauce.  They are to die for.  The BF had to have the edemame which for some reason at this place they always seem to be on steroids!  They are huge.  It is served with a little cup of sea salt that you can sprinkle on as you see fit.  For the entrees BF had mongolian beef with steamed rice.  Very similar to PF....aws flav.  I usually try to steal a few bites when he's not looking.  I ordered the seseme chicken but instead of fried I asked for their \"stalk velvet\" which is a healthy version of cooking.  I think its kind of pan seared.  You can order most dishes this way but you have to ask for it special.  Their brown rice is alway cooked to perfection.  I dont know why it is that hard to cook brown rice but you'd be suprised.  

Food is ALWAYS great.  I dont think of all the years we have been coming here we have ever been disappointed!  The customer service-just because of the waitresses they have had has been simply amazing.  Enough to make you coming back even if the food wasnt that great. haha  So don't tell me you never heard of this place - you just did!"}
{"text":"Horrible. We have been eating Pei Wei for years and that was one of the worst meals we've had in awhile. The teriyaki crunch roll was tasteless. No flavor at all. The orange peel chicken tasted dirty and the portion of meat for the large size was small but it didn't matter because it didn't get eaten it was so bad. The rice was cold, not even warm ...cold. Tables were dirty. Bathroom was gross. Can't believe how this restaurant has changed. We get better food at the local place down the street and won't hesitate to continue to go there. It will be a long time before we go back to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Have gone here with my elderly parents several times, but no more. Food is pretty tasty and price is ok but the management is beyond terrible: the place is *freezing,* as in needing to wear mittens & knit cap type of freezing. Never been in any restaurant like that. Also, today the Coke machine was being refilled by an employee who didn't quite know what she was doing. Ok -- but the manager never made an appearance to assist her and get the machine working. Never got a drink until nearly done.

No more, not worth it."}
{"text":"I wanted to echo the 1 star review from a few weeks ago in which Denise L said the experience was horrible because everything looked dirty. Someone from Pei Wei responded \"give us another chance and we promise you'll have a delightful clean experience\". Well weeks later the place is still super dirty everywhere. Afraid to touch anything. The floor is supposed to be a light wood color, but I ran a moist napkin along the floor and the napkin turned BLACK immediately. We had a group of 6 and they brought out everyone's entrees at separate times literally each one arriving by itself 1 at a time 5 minutes apart so the first person was finished well before the last person was even served. We love their food but boy their atmosphere is so hard to put up with. Don't know why they downgraded their flooring and furniture. Only get them to go I guess."}
{"text":"Ordered online and it said it would be ready at 4:55. Go in pay and wait 25 mins. Half of my order was done when I got there and 25 min later they completed my order. Total waste of time and money"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken  teriyaki bowl. The chicken was hard , at least I think it was chicken. It was uneatable . Either it was way overcooked or way over breaded. It had sort of woody texture. Had to throw it away. I will be hesitant to return."}
{"text":"The only thing more ridiculous than calling this food, is actually eating it. The one star is because yelp made me."}
{"text":"Ok, seriously? What did this place do to the Asian Chopped Chicken Salad?!  This used to be a super yummy salad that truly was an \"Asian\" type salad. Now, it's like a regular dinner salad with some scallions on it. It's not Asian at all! How can you call this an Asian chicken salad, when there is nothing Asian about it! The description also says it comes with crispy wontons, which it most definitely did not have. I do like Pei Wei, but I had to only give two stars for this trip, because of the huge disappointment of this ridiculous \"Asian\" chopped chicken salad!  It says, \"new recipe.\"  Well, this \"new recipe\" was not an improvement! $8 for a typical dinner salad."}
{"text":"Took the family there last week.  Ordered fried wontons, sweet and sour beef, Mongolian beef, honey crusted chicken and pad Thai noodles.  

The Mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.

Honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.

Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.

They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he \"let us keep the spring rolls\" and \"didn't charge is for all of our drinks\" as if he did us a favor.

Overall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!

I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day.."}
{"text":"I'm a fan for sure.  I love tofu and I've been searching for a place that serves it the way I like it - thin, crisp and loaded with flavor...Pei Wei has it all covered!  Throw in brown rice with a firm texture, sriracha on the table and two unique and delicious iced teas and I'm in heaven!!!

I've had lunch there a few times and had take out twice.  You have a tofu option at just about every turn which is a real bonus.  I've been stuck on the Thai Dynamite the last three times but I have also loved the Kung Pao and Sesame tofu as well.

Service at lunch has been extremely fast but it's a small place so you're not guaranteed a place to sit.  I wish they put more veggies in the dish but I'll get over it if they keep cooking the tofu to perfection.

Prices are fair for the big plate of food you get...$10 something for Thai Dynamite, brown rice and a large drink - fair enough in my book considering I could have had a second lunch from the leftovers."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner and it was delicious.  We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and i chose the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken with brown rice.  It was delicious.  The price was just right for the amount of food, unable to finish the whole meal.  Will for sure go back and have again!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken fried rice here.  I always get a kick out of the soda machine, every flavor you've ever imagine and who doesn't like to try your luck at a fortune cookie again and again.  Great food at good prices. Fast services."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian franchise restaurants. The prices are very reasonable and the serving size is very good for the price. The only negative thing I can report is I love the pad Thai and Mongolian beef dishes so much I can't force myself to try any other dishes. I normally rotate between the two dishes and grab a side of combo fried rice."}
{"text":"When my kids want Asian food, this is always where they want to go. The kids always get the honey chicken with noodles and eat every bite. For me and the hubby, we usually get the hot and sour soup (very good), the crab puffs( love the sauce), or the pot stickers (yummy). For entrees, I have had just about everything on the menu. My favorite is the Kung Pao chicken or the shrimp fried rice. They just installed a new soda machine that has more than 100 flavors to create. Very cool. The cashiers and wait staff have always been very nice as well."}
{"text":"I hate writing 1 star reviews, though I feel it necessary to get the attention of management.. we have been going her since opening day and seen an incredible decrease in in quality and service ... online orders placed for the last 3 visits have all  been missing complete meals.. Pickup time is very late.. speaking with people waiting in line all seem to be experiencing the same delay and order mistakes.. worst of all nobody seems to care about the mistakes!!!  When we called to alert them, their response is a manger will call you back, still waiting . Pei Wei is a great concept and good food, though this location has no leadership who is willing to take responsibility for getting the orders right!!!"}
{"text":"Incompetent!
Ordered on-line at 1 PM for 6 PM pick-up. If you order on-line hours before, why does it take another 55 minutes to deliver the food?  Don't waste you time with this crew.  Plenty of good restaurants who will honor your time and deliver a good meal without waiting that long."}
{"text":"I love the lettuce wraps here. They are simply the best.  I order carry out often from here. I occasionally dine in.  My problem with the dinning in is the seating. It is always difficult to find a seat.  The place really needs to expand.  If you have a party of more than 4 most days you can hang it up.  Other than the seating I like it. Large portions of rice and noodles.  A little stingy on the meat."}
{"text":"Maybe time heals all wounds . . . decided to give takeout from Pei Wei another shot since they had some new menu items, including small plates. I have to say that their new Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls are simply delicious! Totally refreshing and a nice portion to eat alone as an entree for lunch or dinner or split it as an appetizer (3 rolls). It comes with two sauces, peanut and sweet chile. For peanut fans, you'll love it, rich and creamy. I love the little kick from the sweet chile. Hubby really enjoyed the new caramel signature dish with chicken. I'm not yet willing to give Pei Wei four stars all the way around, but I'd give the Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls a total five by itself!!!"}
{"text":"I usually love their food but tried the new sushi with mango today and it was one of the worst things I have ever eaten. The quality of the roll was less than something you would expect to get at a convenience store. The mango was almost non-existent and the small piece that I did find was so unripe, it was inedible.  The worst part is that the server that came to our table to remove our plates asked if there was anything wrong with the sushi. I told him it was really terrible and he gave a knowing smile and said that they knew it was bad and that it had not been working out the way they had hoped.  That made me so mad because they know it is bad but they are still selling it to their loyal customers.  

Shame on you, Pei Wei.  

They are also misleading on their online menu. It says in the description that the rolls are made to order, but I tried to get them without cucumber and was told that I couldn't get it that way because they were pre-made.  Another slap in the face from Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Really good food!

Pei Wei is a little pricy, but the food is really good and different from almost anything else in the area. They have a lot of Chinese/Japanese fusion-style cuisine, and it is made fresh to order. 

The dining room is also very spacious and comfortable, and the portions are large enough to share if you want. Overall, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. The service is great, food is outstanding, and the kitchen makes food super fast. I order from the phone and go pick it up and it is done within 8-10 mins."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a last minute dinner and was very disappointed. I ordered the broccoli/chicken and when it came it was floating in soy sauce. It looked more like a soup bowl rather than the entree it was supposed to be.  The manager was very kind and had the dish remade but by that time, my husband had finished his dinner and dinner was ruined. I doubt that I would return."}
{"text":"Pleasant dining experience. Honey seared chicken was light, hot and flavorful. Easy to get to. Seating was very much available. Staff were friendly with speedy service."}
{"text":"Perfect example of what NOT to do. Mgr takes order but before giving back our change she begins a personal conversation in Spanish to another employee and stands there holding our change for 30 seconds. The girl she was having the conversation with goes back to the food that has now been sitting in the window and just looks at it for at least 2 minutes. She was completely clueless. She just kept looking at the tickets and the food. As more food gets piled up in front of her she just starts handing it out. Our food went to the table across from us and the guy just starts eating it. She gets relieved by a \"chef\" who starts bringing out the rest of the food including the guy who now has our foods order. The chef sees me looking at him and I can hear the conveesation. He goes back to the window and asks for our order to be remade quick again in spanish. Of course they make it wrong and we send it back. They finally bring our food. It is thrown in the bowl with no care. The veggie were cold and not cooked. The onions raw and had a black powder on them. I suspect a dirty wok. They knew I knew they had made mistakes  because I was watching them the whole time but they didn't address it they just dropped the food at our table and took off. I use to love eating there but I can say that I will not be going back any time soon"}
{"text":"I like to grab carryout from this location because they have a separate desk for it and they make my life easier. I also like that I can order online and pick up my meal in five minutes. The big bowls and super large meat portions aren't what I'm in for though, I typically get an order of the lettuce wraps and the hot and sour soup (very good). It's nothing ultra traditional Chinese, but it's cheaper than PF Changs and the same quality in a convenient location. Plus, fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu ;). Service has always been great for me."}
{"text":"Food is good not amazing. Too much sauce on the Mongolian chicken. Brown rice is good though. 

We sat outside. There were dirty dishes that sat on the tables around us. We asked the server to clean up. And he did a few minutes later. But it wasn't busy or anything."}
{"text":"Went in today around 7pm and the cashier (_AM Cashier #2) was not paying attention to my order.  Repeated it 3 times to her prior to her repeating the order and it was still incorrect. I stated what i wanted again and i proceeded to pay and when i saw the receipt my order was still wrong.. I don't know if there was an incident going on but she was more focused on what was going on outside than the customers approaching her. Gave it 3 stars because the food was good and the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Although we enjoy the food, this particular location has communication issues. Granted they are usually packed with customers and very busy, but we have had 2 separate occasions where we have been rushed too quickly with our to-go order and we have been shorted on food due to running out. I understand that this happens when you're busy, but at least let me know and discount for adequate portion change please."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years now. Love the food always. Tonight we decided to try one of the new sushi rolls. I ordered my food online like usual. The wait time was 40 minutes and I called them to confirm that was correct time and she told me yes it was. So I waited my 40 mins and went in. When I went to pay the girl told me that they were out of the sushi rolls. I was shocked to hear this because o waited 40 minutes and no one called me to inform me. My husband had not ordered anything else for dinner so it was very upsetting. The girl told me she would make me something else but I had already waited for 40 minutes and I was not about to wait even longer. She didn't offer to give me the rest of the food for free or a cookie or anything. I was very upset at this visit when normally I love this place. Hopefully they can straighten out the ordering system so this doesn't happen in the future."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this was the first time I've ate here !! The kung pao chicken is right on point ...the hot and sour soup is some of the best I had . This place is awesome period ....."}
{"text":"I have been to this Pei Wei multiple times, and while the food is exactly the same as other restaurants, their service is not. Their \"dishwasher\" breaks all the time and they will stop serving food altogether, they will literally shut down the restaurant. On top of this, they won't inform anyone calling, so if you are on hold and are lucky enough to hear the same message about ordering online over and over again for 5 minutes, you might as well hang up and look to a different restaurant. I wouldn't be so bitter about this but this has happened multiple times within the past few months, and its not like I order all that often."}
{"text":"I find their food to just be OK. I know it's P F Chang's fast food, but the food choices don't even come close  Their prices are a bit higher than other fast food Chinese restaurants with comparable meals."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical to go here because of reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered Mongolian beef, curry chicken and Szechuan green beans. It was all really good and reasonably priced!!  Loved the green beans!!"}
{"text":"the food is OK, the best thing is the soda machine {Coca-Cola Freestyle}."}
{"text":"Please go somewhere else and save yourself the hassle. I decided to use my birthday coupon to enjoy a free drink. The restaurant wouldn't honor the coupon. I never had this problem at another Pei Wei. Oh well, it's $2 right? Then the host shooshed me away without the drink I paid for. They weren't that busy, they could at least do something right.

Now for the worst part.... I got an order of edamame, took it back to the office,dumped the salt on it, and proceeded to eat. After eating the top layer, the bottom layer included what appeared to be bits of chewed up meat. Trust me, I ordered my edamame without the second hand flesh. What is grosser than that?

I called to complain and was told to take it up with their online form. I never heard back. I don't plan on hearing back.  Eat here at your own risk - and don't assume everything will be edible."}
{"text":"Don't waste your lunch break here. I Placed order online so it would be ready to go when I got there, went to side pick up door to find it was locked. Line at the main entrance was out the door, once i navigated through that mess the pick up counter was standing room only. Made it back to work almost 30 minutes late with cold food."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, clean location.  Always a good experience here.  Beef Chile Ramen FTW!"}
{"text":"This pei wei has to be the most inconsistent chain restaurant there is. From portion sizes to food preparation - inconsistency must be the theme.  Take your chances and never know what you'll get. 75% of the time it's a disappointment.  My recommendation is to choose elsewhere to dine."}
{"text":"We get gift cards to this spot from the in laws so we eat here if we want take out or need to go to sprouts at night after work.

The service here is friendly and there can be a slight wait at times.

I try to get something different each time but it all kind of tastes the same: sweet sauce with different stir fry veggies over rice or noodles.  The spicy chicken salad is yummy but since I always get my protein steamed instead of deep fried the salad isn't as good!

My hunny likes to get the pei wei extra spicy shrimp with noodles.  I love the crab wontons (of course fried)!

A decent spot if you're in a hurry or have a gift card!"}
{"text":"I've only been to P.F. Chang's once, with a big group of co-workers, and I remember thinking that the food there was fine, in a suburban-mall sort of way. But even though its younger sibling, Pei Wei, nails the sexy interior design and appealing assortment of pan-Asian entrees you'd want in this sort of place, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. 

We perused the menu and settled on three hard-to-fumble options: a Thai-style green chicken curry, orange-peel beef, and Pei Wei spicy chicken --- their approximation of General Tso's --- plus a side of edamame. Each entree came with a choice of white or brown rice.

As we waited for our food, I remarked that the decor seemed unexpectedly pleasant, maybe even nice enough for a casual date.  It's the kind of place you can imagine popping into while shopping, a little more upscale than the food court, but not a 'for-real' restaurant.

The edamame were served warmish, and tasted just like they do everywhere else. The Pei Wei chicken turned out to be everyone's favorite, although I definitely wouldn't call it spicy (even though the menu does). We enjoyed the green curry's flavor, although the chicken turned out more like meat-jelly, probably the result of over-marinating. The beef was the disappointment of the bunch, a sitcky-sweet mess of strangely chewy meat garnished with with huge slices of carrot... huh? The accompanying white rice was fine, but the brown rice was seriously undercooked: It rattled like gravel when stirred."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We tried calling in our order and we were on hold 25 minutes. At one point they answered and said nothing. We sat there listening to their conversation. We then walked in and ordered and got our food after 10 minutes and they still had not answered our call. It was not busy and the employees were in their phones. If you want to order, DO NOT call in."}
{"text":"Ordered large entre w/extra meat with salad to go.  When I got home realized they hardly gave me any salad.  Called the Manager on duty and informed him of the problem and he told me to come back (I live 15 minutes away) and he would give me more salad, so 30 minutes at least round trip.  I asked for some sort of a credit and he said that would be ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is the worst managed restaurant I have had the misfortune of dining at or in this case take out that I can remember. For some reason this location never answers the phone, the website is frequently down, the food is inconsistent and overpriced, and the service is nonexistent. If you were looking for small portions of inconsistent overpriced food and poor service you can find it all here."}
{"text":"The Asian food version of chipotle. Fresh ingredients, prepared well, reasonably priced and fast. Great lunch spot or dinner to go."}
{"text":"I love PeiWei! I rarely eat in-store, but their call ahead pick-up and curb-side pick-up is amazing! Every time I call-in it's usually a 15-20 minute pick-up time which is just perfect. They never fail to not have my food ready on time! The staff is decent; sometimes they are very rushed because of large crowds, so they are kind of short, but never rude. They usually still smile despite running around a mile-a-minute.

 I've ordered pick-up meals for a few years and there was only one instance when my order was not correct. I realized it when I got into the parking lot: missing the lettuce wraps! Uh oh. Walked back into the store and had to wait a few minutes for my lettuce wraps but they were very apologetic about it and gave me an unexpected $20 gift card because of the inconvenience. Now that's good customer service!

PeiWei also came out with a new mobile ordering site which makes ordering from my iPhone very easy. Sweet!

Food quality is always tasty. Always tastes fresh and flavorful. It's not as good as PF Changs, but for the price and the wait time you really can't complain. Yum!"}
{"text":"Quality has really slipped.  This used to be a family go-to, but this is our second straight (and last) bad experience.  Brown rice had strong plastic aroma.  Honey seared chicken was heavily breaded.  Salad had too many chunks of cabbage root.  No dipping sauce for crab wontons.  The only OK dish was kids teriyaki noodles, but even that had no veggies in it.  Looks like we're on the lookout for a new Asian spot."}
{"text":"I've been a fan when I need something quick because I won't eat traditional fast food burger joints. Called in an order, told me 15 minutes but came in early and the food was ready. I liked the way they used to operate when they had BOGO offers via email but they stopped it. So no, I hardly go. I wished they still did it but I guess the good old days are over."}
{"text":"A very cool concept of a new age Chinese food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary amount of grease in spring rolls, enough oil to soak a napkin. Also,  pad tai so greasy it was glistening. Notified the manager who gave me a couple free appetizer promotions for a free appetizer next time. Had eaten here on a number of occasions and pretty good. Tonight a horrible experience. Not going back here. Too many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Called in a to-go order at 830pm to ask what time they took their last pick up order. He said 840 so I went ahead and ordered. They close at 930. I ordered traditional lettuce wraps...thai dynamite chicken with broccoli...teriyaki bowl and thai basil chicken. Im sad to say I was pretty disappointed with everything except the lettuce wraps. And even the lettuce wraps came with these tiny pieces of iceberg lettuce. Didn't have enough lettuce for the filling. 
It takes a lot for me to not eat something and my thai dynamite chicken was just not good. I wanted spicy and it wasn't spicy at all and had a very odd flavor. My bf said his was just alright...
Haven't eaten there in awhile I remember it being good..but probably won't eat there again unfortunately. 
Also when we got there at about 915pm to pick it up the guy was taking a to go order on the phone...I thought the last to go order had to be placed at 840pm. 
Oh well...learned my lesson. Quality of food was not up to par"}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei. I always have. I usually stick to my reg. order of the traditional lettuce wraps. Well today I decided to try the fried rice with extra chicken. I also went with a friend who got the sesame chicken and white rice. We went around 3:30pm, and it was not busy at all. We waited about 30 minutes until my friend got her food and the order was wrong, they didn't give her extra chicken. Then we waited another 10mins for mine order. My food was okay (not the greatest in flavor or texture) and my friend's was spicy, that is normal, well they bring extra chicken and the flavor is completely different, and my friend found pieces of plastic in her drink. Anyways, while we are eating two employees sit down next to us with a friend and one of the employees (very loudly) starts complaining about a customer who had asked for a manager because they waited 1 hour for rice with sauce. The girl proceed to talk about how they didn't have a manager and continued to complain about this customer. I decided to leave. Once I get home I proceeded to get sick from the food. Hoping the chicken was cooked correctly. I understand the food business is hard and I will eventually go back. But I was not impressed with today's food or service."}
{"text":"I really judge a place by its willingness to step up when they screw up!  

I ate last night at Pei Wei at the Summit in North Scottsdale, had Orange Peel Chicken & spent the night with all the AWFUL symptoms of food poisoning.  I tried calling the mgr all morning.  No one picked  up until 11:30. 

I called their corporate office,told someone my issue @she put me into the \"we're very busy...\" Vm.  No call back.  

Finally I reached the location mgr.  Of course, \"it's just not possible\".  Yea right!  Tell that to my toilet!!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed...  drove 20 minutes (each way) on my lunch hour  to pick up my favorite Pei Wei go to for over 12 years, chicken pad Thai....  with the drink the meal was nearly 15.00.   The chicken was so dry I had a few bites and dumped the meal and drank the soda I had ordered...   won't visit this location again..  :("}
{"text":"Who needs to \"yelp\" Pei Wei, right?  Right.  However, this review is about this particular location.  I work right down the street and have experienced this store so many different ways now that I had to write a review.  Our company has pre-ordered off of the catering menu here; a large and complicated order - but everything was perfect.  I've come into this store with \"free meal\" coupons, pre-ordered online and picked up food, etc., and received professional, friendly, really outstanding service every time.  How many other restaurants call you to see how your order was today?  I find their staff very sharp and helpful.  Yes, they do get extremely busy at this location, but I have yet to see any staff members look frazzled or unprepared.  They are really on top of it here.  This is a five star Pei Wei, if that makes sense. :)"}
{"text":"I like going to Pei Wei for some fast casual Asian food. It's like the Panera Bread of Asian cuisine. The food is good and filling, but nothing to write home about. What I do like, though, is that they've now got different sizes of food you can order. A small order is more than enough for one person. I have a hearty appetite, but recently I couldn't even finish a small order of the fried rice with steak.

The food is delivered to the table pretty quickly, the place is clean, and the employees are friendly. I enjoy going to this place for lunch or a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service. We waited 30 minutes to recover our food when it was not even busy. When we got it the steak was tough and gristly and one of the dishes has a piece of partially raw chicken. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is adding a new concept to their lineup - \"Pei Wei Asian Market\". The menu has removed all the soups and most of the noodle dishes. Portions have been reduced and sandwiches have been added to the menu. 

The good news - the decor and the layout are quite nice. 

The bad news - I just really don't get it. It is like Pei Wei with a few odd items and higher prices. The portions and prices have been reduced, but seems to be more expensive. Also, they have removed the kids menu."}
{"text":"Twice now I've had to get my money returned after waiting more than 30 minutes for my order. People were served that placed orders after me. Then had to wait for the manager to return my money until we were late to our movie we had reserved. The first time this happened I thought I would never to return to pei wei. I gave it 6 months and tried again and amazingly the same situation. Yeah.... I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered Take-out of Chicken Fried Rice on Saturday night. When I got home it was half chicken and half shrimp. Rather than return to Pei Wei I went ahead and ate it; I wish now that I hadn't. The next morning I became violently ill which lasted the entire miserable day. I am assuming the shrimp was bad since I had not had anything else to eat since some oatmeal at breakfast. I wont be returning to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Walks into the 7th St and Glendale Pei Wei.  Sees that the line is only 5 deep.  Nods approvingly. 

5 minutes pass.  Now he's 3rd in line. 

5 more minutes pass, during which time 2 parties behind walk out due to the long wait. 

Reaches counter. 

Scowling hostess: \"What would you like?\"

My son:  \"Can I please have the Thai Dynamite Chicken with white rice\"

\"Sure. And for you?\"

Me: \"Um, I'd like the $5 General Tso's special, please.\"

\"We're not doing that special anymore.  That ended.\"

Me, nodding towards the massive screen advertising the special, as well as the printed sign posted on a flier on the wall over her shoulder: \"You mean the advertised special over there and there?\"

(snaps eyes to the screen) \"Yeah, it rings up as $8.99 now when I put it in. It's over.\"

Silence

Me: \"Ok, I guess I'll have the $5 Mongolian Monday bowl with white rice.  You're still doing that?\"

\"Yes\"

Sits at table with son. 

Food finally arrives. 

Son's meal is served with fried rice, not white, so the (very nice) server brings out an extra bowl of white rice. 

The chicken in my bowl is lukewarm and tastes like it has been reheated, not freshly cooked.  You know that flavor you get if you try to pan fry left over Chinese food from the night before?  That flavor. 

Visited the bathroom when it was time to leave and it was seriously the nastiest bathroom I've visited this side of the Gila Bend Texaco.  Urine everywhere. Soap and water all over the sink counters.  Trash on floor.  It was truly impressive.

I left here wondering, \"Is this Pei Wei Diner franchised?\"  I've eaten at Pei Weis all over the Valley for the last 18 years or so, including frequently at the one by my house on Bell, and have never had an experience as negative as this one from start to finish.  

The only bright spot was the table waiter, a young man whose name I didn't catch. He corrected the incorrect rice order proactively and cheerfully.  

We used to eat at this Pei Wei frequently after church years ago, then stopped when it was converted to a diner and the menu changed.  This was my first return trip in years and very vividly reminded me why we quit it in the first place. 

Pei Wei GM: Trust me when I say this, you have issues at this store."}
{"text":"i hate this restaurant i normally love pei wei but if u come to this one it's basically like your burning your money away so this is a warning do not come to this pei wei unless u want to wast your money i have never been so upset about a restaurant just dont come to this location!"}
{"text":"I would like to give a 0 star;(  third time I have gotten home and my order is wrong.  As I waited for my order I observed another customer complaining  about a messed up order. My food was wrong my husband's was right but tasted like kerosine or like a burning chemical taste??? So over it now!!"}
{"text":"Do not go to Pei Wei.   Try something else.    The food was mediocre and the service was terrible.   We waited 45 minutes for the food only to realize they got the order wrong and had to wait again.   The \"free steak and shrimp\" offer appeared to be a BOGO coupon, yet turned out to be $1.00 off.   Very deceptive marketing combined with terrible service and mediocre food...We will never go back again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! As a family it was alright! Everybody's food came out at different times which wasn't so cool. Nobody got to eat at the same time. As far as the food the lettuce wraps are the best thing on their menu. A little disappointed, especially after driving over 25 minutes to come here. Local chinese, Japanese places are just as good if not better!"}
{"text":"Watered down P.F. Changs never tasted so....just like you'd expect.

Pei Wei is a mystery to me.  It isn't quite what PF Changs used to be (I think the quality has drastically decreased over the last few years) and it isn't take-out Chinese either.  They offer a few different influences in their dishes (Korean, Thai, Chinese, Japanese) but all are bland and disappointing.  They're missing the point here.  Either go for the low cost, greasy take out we all love, or the more refined, pricier fare you'd find elsewhere.  

Unfortunately Pei Wei is lost in the middle where it should be."}
{"text":"Always great food! Fast service  very nice people. I sat at the bar and watched the chefs cook and they were fast,efficient, clean, respectful and always had a smile. Love the chicken lettuce wraps. I always make a visit when I'm in Vegas on the way back to Arizona"}
{"text":"I went on the app to order dinner. It asked if I was a member of their \"previous\" rewards program. I was not able to log in, so my previous points are gone. I called to order. It was an hour wait and no sushi. This location has been mediocre for quite a while, orders wrong when you pick them up, unable to order off the app in the past also, unable to order online, and long waits for simple orders. Not sure what their problem is, if it's management or corporate or both, but not sure I will torture myself to return here."}
{"text":"yummy food. great prices. always crowded. sometimes it takes awhile to order food because of the crowds. but i have loved every dish i have gotten here. ramen noodles and pad thai are my favorites."}
{"text":"Salt, salt, salt. We used to love their lettuce wraps, best anywhere. Now we find them inedible. Their kung pao used to be good too. Everything else I thought was good has fallen off the menu too. I kept trying to give them more chances, but I am done. It IS clean and they have very nice people working there, hence the second star."}
{"text":"We are from out-of-town and after a long drive we stopped at Avondale's Pei Wei to pick up dinner.  The food tasted better than we had anticipated !  The tofu was crisp, and the fresh vegetables were delicious and scrumptious! Carlos was very accommodating with our special request.

What a great dining experience.  As a retired teacher, I give you 12/10 on tonight's meal."}
{"text":"Consistently prepares good tasting dishes, no matter what you order.  The takeout I ordered was ready when I arrived, exactly the time I ordered it for, and was prepared just the way we ordered it, with a minor exception. Chris, the manager, courteously took care of the issue we had with the order.  The staff is friendly, courteous and helpful whenever we visit."}
{"text":"By far the worst pei wei in the valley. They cater to the to-go orders and they leave the for in customer hanging. The worst service and the portions are smaller then other pei wei locations. Go to dragon wok instead."}
{"text":"I give them 3 stars only for the following reasons:

- Echo is extremely annoying as you dine in \" Ceiling and wall design problem \" 
Simply you may leave with a headache!

- On several occasions they just can't your order right!

Still like their food, I still give them my business \" Carry out only \""}
{"text":"Love me some Pei Wei...They have some yummy Asian cuisine having a great staff is very important"}
{"text":"This Pei Wei is located right next to a movie theater that we frequent.  During 2 of the last 5 visits, our food had not arrived after 30 minutes of waiting.  The two times this occurred recently we arrived an hour before our movie time, and ended up wasting so much time waiting for food and the refund we requested that we weren't able to eat somewhere else until after the movie.  

They have a lot of people working there, and LOTS of people back in the kitchen area, but nothing was coming out.  They seemed to be concentrating on the To-Go orders instead of the completely full dining room that had over 80% of the tables waiting for their food.  When dishes were finally put on the counter for delivery, there was one rookie-looking guy trying to figure out where the food goes.  He'd deliver one dish to this table and one dish to that table, so that some folks in the party were completely finished by the time another person's dish finally showed up.

Although I love their food, I will never go back there again.  A 40% failure rate is not good."}
{"text":"As with any restaurant, not all menu selection will please any given customer. That is why the menu is diverse. I love that Pei Wei attempts to provide new selections, frequently. 
Their new menu selections that emanated from their Test Kitchen restaurants is excellent. My favorites are the Polynesian Poke and Ahi salad. Great taste and price. I must say I have been disappointed with freshness at other locations. Size of the salad could be a tad larger. 
I also appreciate that you can tailor the order wth add-ons and delete certain items when ordering any entree or salad. 
Their snickerdoodle cookies are great and are free if you take survey online. 
Their rewards program helps with free entree after recurrent visits. Online freebies and discounts are also great. 
The service is not perfect BUT the majority of the time I find the experience pleasant. Their young staff is trying!!
I order by phone and pick up order without hassle. 
My tip to customers is to be specific with your order and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food great prices just a heads up when their food has a spicy warning label on it you better believe them!"}
{"text":"I gave one star because I couldn't post a review without putting one but I have gone here for the last time. They mess up our order every time for the last 6 orders. This time after driving all the way back to give them my wrong order the manager said I was being ridiculous and laughed. I have my receipt and what u got is not what I ordered. I will leave it up to you but we are done."}
{"text":"My partner and I have visited this place frequently in the last 2 years. We thought it was great. Mellow, charismatic hostess. Chill chefs and nice waiters/waitresses. But today, was probably the worst it has ever been. The cashiers are rude(not to mention ugly) and that right there ruined the whole experience for me. Never coming to this location again.

Management needs to take a closer look at the kind of associates it hires. This is absolutely ridiculous.

Not to mention they hand other establishments refreshments on their serving dock. Way to go Pei Wei."}
{"text":"The GF has been very focused on her diet over the last 10 weeks.  Our \"go-to\" places so she sticks to Lean meats with veggies include Greens & Proteins, Jason's Deli ( salad Bar ) Terriyaki Boy or similar and  any breakfast place that serves veggie egg white omelets with a side a fruit.  Lately, her fav place is Pei Wei.  Surprisingly, I've come to enjoy Pei Wei, too.

Her standard dish is Chicken Curry ( sauce on the side ) , \"stock velvet\" with extra veggies, no onion and brown rice ( 7.95) - It's a very large serving for the price.

I usually get a bowl of hot and sour soup ( $4.95) - a little too \"thick \" from what i presume is corn starch but i like it and it's a very generous serving.  I then prefer the dan dan noodles with Shrimp ($8.50) - I've yet to finish it given the large portion provided.  Again, for what it is, I'm a fan.  Yes, it's \"americanized\" but i don't care.  It's freshly prepared, served fast, large portions, reasonably priced and above average taste.

pics included"}
{"text":"Wow ~ from Pei Wei Asian Diner to Marketplace.  What interesting yummy food changes and the property is beautiful and very chic.  My son let me know we are going back again today.   He was all about the meatball sandwich and sweet potatoe fries.
As always ~ way to go Pei Wei, you keep current with the times and your customers likes.   This is a winner."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pei Wei for years and have always loved the food, but my last experience deserved a review because of the service. I called in an order for two honey seared chicken dishes that I was going to pick up about an hour before they closed. We picked up the order, but when we got home we realized that while one order was correct, the other was teriyaki shrimp. At this point, they were closing in about 25 minutes. I called the restaurant where the manager offered to put in a new order for us to pick up despite the fact that they would be closing by the time I got there. The manager let us in, gave us a new dish, would have let us keep the incorrect one if we had wanted to, and even paid me back the money for the one that was incorrectly prepared because we had to drive all the way back. Mistakes happen, my judgment comes from how they are handled. In this case I left a completely satisfied customer."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The service is really bad.   They gave me someone else's food,  then my food to still another person.    The girl then yelled that she \"didn't have time for this\"    When I got my food on the third attempt,  I dropped my fork and was told by the girl at the register \"hey,  pick it up\" as she pointed at it.   I guess they really don't need repeat business in an airport.   The food is really good,  so accept whatever order you are given and be very quick to pickup anything you might drop and all will be ok."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. The food was nothing special, reminded me of something you would get from the frozen section of the grocery store, and heat at home. I used to go to this chain years ago, and it has definitely gone down hill. One of the dishes had shrimp in it, which were breaded, and they were clearly low-quality, not breaded fresh or likely even in store? Prices go up, but the quality is going down.

More frustrating than the low quality food, was the subpar customer service. There was a lady who was running food, acting as an expeditor. She literally did not say one extra word other than the name of the dish that she is delivering. She didn't smile, doesn't say hello, doesn't ask if I can get anything else, just shows up, announces the dish, put the down and leaves.  We asked for a couple plates, and she literally did not say a word, rolled her eyes, and brought the two plates on her way to deliver another order. This lady should not be delivering food, as she is essentially one of the main people you interact with when you dine in.   my friend and I both commented in how shocking it was that she had absolutely zero personality, zero interaction, and why isn't a manager paying attention??

We dined in there last night, on a Wednesday evening, it was pretty slow (approx. 6:50 arrival), yet the restaurant was very dirty. Many tables are dirty, lots of food and napkins on the floor of circle tables, and the booths clearly had crumbs and greasy hand prints at several different tables?

A manager was not present at ANY point throughout our 45 minute plus visit. When we received the food (2 entrees and a aide of blistered green beans), and disliked the shrimp dish, I wanted to speak to a manager, but clearly this place is being run by high school and college kids, with nobody visible or clearly in charge. As I was leaving, I asked who the manager was, they named her by name, but said she was in the back. I'm sure they could have asked her to come out, but the fact that she didn't make a single appearance anywhere in the cooking area or dining area during our visit, I'm not sure how much help she would have been. I think the corp. or district-level management needs to know what's going on with the store, so you have a chance to correct it."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place since I wasn't sure what an \"Asian diner\" meant, but we decided to try it anyway. 

It's like an express PF Changs - it's owned by the same company and they have some of PF Changs items on the menu. You order at the counter, they give you a number and then they bring your food out to you. 

We got the lettuce wraps as an app and they were really good - they tastes the same as they do at PF Changs. I ordered a weird shrimp dish which I wasn't so thrilled avoid, but I don't really like shrimp so I don't know why I ordered it in the first place. It was good enough for what it was. Next time I'll stick to li mein :)."}
{"text":"Just lousy service. Stopped here for lunch.  Waited at least 5 min to get someone to take my order. A guy emptying trash and refilling things apologized and took the order. Told me I would be called when ready. Order was to go. There were 2 workers filling small to go condiment containers who were deep in conversation. After watching other to go orders get picked up and waiting 15-20 min I asked about my order. It was just sittting on the counter. They could have cared less."}
{"text":"I normally would give higher stars to Pei Wei, however this location leaves a lot to be desired.

I live in the neighborhood so we come here every once in awhile but each time there is some issue with the order. Either they cannot figure out how to pull up our past orders (we order the same thing each time) in the system, they miss something key in the order or, like tonight, the cashiers are unaware of what items the kitchen is out of (tonight it was bell peppers).

Other locations I have been to, I have not experienced these issues so I would still recommend Pei Wei for fast/casual Asian dining, especially if you are looking for gluten free options."}
{"text":"We are winter residents and always look forward to eating here when we return.  Sorry to say we were quite disappointed with our Pad Thai orders today, so much sauce that it resembled a thick soup.  The egg ingredient seemed to be overlooked and was in big slices rather than smaller curds,  when I asked a server about the sauce he replied that it wasn't really sauce but that the rice noodles were too wet.  Either way, it was not a pleasant dish today."}
{"text":"Today's visit the service was much improved from the previous week. I ordered the crab wonton's and the beef broccoli.  The beef broccoli arrived immediately and was fresh and hot. The crab wonton's did not arrive until I was nearly finished with my entrée. The food is fresh, but the service is not reliable. Last week my entrée sat on the counter for almost 15 minutes before they served it (cold beef broccoli ) & the restaurant was not overly busy."}
{"text":"It's really too bad this location's customer service has diminished.  This used to be the the best location (in my opinion).  There was always a manger present on the floor and everything ran smoothly and the employees were engaging and seemed genuinely happy.  Recently, and on more than one occasion, my takeout order has been wrong and the employees seem disconnected and bothered.  Even when I reached out to customer service to let them know about my experience, I got a form letter email response with a promise of a follow-up which never occurred.  It would be nice if new owners/management would take over and turn things around because I love the food!  But I'm not willing to spend my money at any establishment who doesn't value me as a customer."}
{"text":"We haven't been back to Pei Wei in a while since they made some serious menu changes and things seemed to have gone down hill. Today it was more out of convenience than anything else that I actually went back.

The staff were friendly enough and I placed my order very quickly, but since it was before the typical lunch rush would begin there were very few of us in the place. The things I noticed though before my lunch arrived began to trouble me. First was the doors to the restrooms, they were filthy! The restrooms themselves were clean enough, but the doors looked like they were from an old service station; covered with greasy dirt on both sides.

Once I sat down and began looking about the dining area, which appeared clean at first glance, began to show it's true state. Carpets that were badly in need of a \"bisselling\", spots under the tables that showed that the tables had not been moved when the floors were cleaned, the stainless steel was a mess and the soda machines were an absolute disgrace. When I went to take a bottle of soy sauce off of the shelf all of the bottles were filthy and actually stuck to the shelf!

In the same line the wood work and the window sills had not been dusted in a very long time. and the more I looked about me the more details I came across that should have been taken care of by an observant staff.

When I told the manager of some of my observations he did in fact take all of the soy bottles into the back to be cleaned and he came out and cleaned the shelf himself. A good first step actually.

All that being said the food was pretty good, which was really a surprise. And that's a good sign too."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here but the way this location runs is a disaster. We came during a busy time so we expected a bit of a wait. Our food came out relatively quickly which was nice, however the wait just to place our order was about 45 minutes. There was ONE register open with 4 girls around the counter. One of the girls stood at one of the register and didn't take a single order and frankly could care less about the length of the line or that the customers were getting irritated. To make up for her lack of effort in all areas she would stock the napkins every so often perhaps to make it look like she was doing something. As we approached the front of the line many of the guests waiting for Togo orders or call in orders that they had placed over an hour ago were telling us that they had been neglected entirely. Lines stayed long and people were willing to wait to get their food but something needs to be done and more than a single register needs to be open when the line is wrapping around the building."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so deserving of the average 3 stars because of your highly dissatisfying meal and slow, understaffed service. Let me explain:

1. I came in and it took several minutes to get a cashier to get my order. He was okay. My feelings aren't hurt, but this shouldn't be the case since it was a slow Wednesday afternoon with a handful of people.
2. I chose Pad Thai with the veggie+tofu option. The taste barely resembled Pad Thai and the flavor of the entire meal was bland yet strangely sour due to the sauce, especially since it basically drowned in it. I didn't even squeeze the lime. I could barely tell there were other flavors, which is a pity. I thought I tasted cilantro in there, but I'm not so sure now.
3. Overall, it was so filling but unsatisfying. 

Here are some suggestions to improve your quality:

1. LESS SAUCE. I cannot emphasize that enough. Western Asian food chains always seem to do this. Maybe add more crushed peanuts or peanut butter (is that even allowed?).
2. Taste a sample of your cooking, please. If it tastes strange to you, then it's pretty gross in big quantities. 
3. Try chopping vegetables at home more often. It's cute some of your veggies were cut unevenly but I couldn't fit some pieces in my mouth aka the broccoli. 

Then again, this is a food chain so what else do I expect. If you want Westernized Pad Thai or Westernized Asian food in general, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Frankly I love this place it is all about fresh and quick in and out! The orange chicken is my fav here but Kung pao is pretty darned tempting too!"}
{"text":"Went to Pei Wei tonight on an unseasonably cool evening.  We ordered and went to sit outside and found that 3 of the 9 tables were occupied.  No joke, the rest of the tables were full of dishes and half eaten food.  No one was cleaning them inside or out.  There were several tables inside in the same condition.  Somewhat concerning if the area for customers look this way what does the food prep and kitchen area look like.  It wasn't even very bust.  Will not be coming back.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Notice the word \"market\" over the door, it is NOT a good thing. My family was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of food that was served. The portions were smaller, the lettuce wraps tasted like burnt oil, the king pao chicken was mystery meat that included something pointy. This is decidedly NOT pei wei junior, it is much lower on the quality scale."}
{"text":"Just Ordered a to go order, waited 40 minutes, got back to work with food. Realized it was wrong, called for credit. Unfortunately got the manager who was arguing with me about the order and that I was lying.... and he has worked there for 14 years, and bagged all the food, wouldnt look my order up and said he needed proof. 

Moron, no wonder this location isnt doing good! 

No dressing with salad, wrong chicken with order no utensils and the manager told me he is the one who bagged it and I am wrong! 
 
Awesome manager! 

I will stay at my local Pei Wei at the Summit on Ashler Hills in Scottsdale, thats a good Pei Wei. Manager at 7th should learn how manage!"}
{"text":"Was looking for failing grades on the health district maps today,  Pei Wei was on it.

{"text":"Love Asian good for sure. I like this place, good food and nice customer service. I like coming to this place a lot! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering online, unless you have an extra half hour to wait after your order is supposed to be ready. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service from everyone!  It was really busy for lunch and pretty loud. There was a huge line which appeared to move quickly."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years. They are inconsistent. At first we would only occasionally  have a bad experience but over time it has become more bad than good. Every so often we try to give the place another chance but the lettuce wraps we order include extra grease and shards of lettuce and the pei wei spicy is not so hot. I once loved this place but its just not performing how it used to."}
{"text":"Food was not bad but the inside truly need some scrubbing. The restrooms smells of sewage but not too overwhelming that I would vomit."}
{"text":"My brief review in haiku form:

Cheap PF Chang's fix.
Better than Panda Express
You can get beer here.

Thank you."}
{"text":"Horrible experience from getting the order wrong, to a frazzled and stressed staff, to food and drinks all over the floor, to the 1 busted high chair with 6 families dining in, to the potstickers and the glass of wine that never made it. All we wanted was a relaxed Friday night dinner- when I told management that we wanted to go boxes, as we couldn't eat there because everything was messed up the order was wrong the service was wrong and there is no high chair for the toddler we had with us he asked how we paid and gave us our money back no argument made --- clearly they were used to complaints and will never see my business again. 7th Street and Glendale  Pei Wei, you disappoint!"}
{"text":"Definitely learned that the kids menu is the way to go.  Check out the price to portion between a kids teriyaki and an adult portion.  Otherwise, love this place for their consistent friendly service, orders made right the first time, and never boring menu."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has gone downhill. This used to be a favorite of ours but after tonight's visit I doubt we'll be back. The restaurant is clearly not clean and there are bugs crawling around the kitchen and restroom. See photo"}
{"text":"If you like P.F. Changs, you will love Pei Wei! It's essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting, & Take-Out! I can't tell a difference between their Orange Chicken, or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag!!!
My favorite dish here is the Dan-Dan Noodles! (It's Hot. Spicy, & Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under $10!!!)

If you have not heard; \"Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food!\" Well neither is Panda Express, but I'll tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express & most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US! 
Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants! (NO MSG!)

\"Can you believe the balls on this guy!?\"

We'll I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco, LA, NY, Vancouver & Dallas! I've even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong; don't be impressed it was not that good! I love Chinese food, but I really love Asian Fusion! Roy's, PF Changs, & Pei Wei really wet my noodle!

The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out! 
I have them on speed dial...
So when I'm on my way home from work I'll call, & as I pull in I pay, pick up, and go! It's freshly cooked & No Wait!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I forget how subpar Pei Wei really is. I forget about the wilted vegetables, impractical prices, and the way they either put way too much or too little sauce, and not to mention the gut bomb that follows. If you're thinking Pei Wei for dinner tonight, I would definitely think twice."}
{"text":"Tasty Asian American style  food. I go there about 4 times a week. The food is always hot and fresh. Clean restaurant, not too pricey and Friendly employees,,, Deserves not less than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of my very favs but lately it has been losing it's appeal and quality.

I ordered egg rolls which taste was impossible to identify. The fried rice with beef tasted like burned oil. The teriyaki chicken was good.

One thing I love is the Coke machine with all kinds of crazy stuff. My drink: Ice, half glass of peach flavored Sprite zero and half glass of sparkling water. I like to keep things simple.

All in all Pei Wei is a decent place to grab an inexpensive ok food."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is delicious and healthy! One of the best things is their take away service. Just call in your order and they will have it ready in a few minutes it's a great way to avoid the long waits at lunch time.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just a tip - quinoa costs extra! Ordered the Korean Spicy with Quinoa noodle bowl as advertised. Got the Korean Spicy with noodles - no quinoa. When asked the reply was \"It's either quinoa or noodles.\" In either case, it's 0.99 extra."}
{"text":"Would have put no stars. My boyfriend and I went there tonight at 9:30pm to get some food. Too bad they already locked their doors. We double checked what time they close and there's incorrect information on two sites. One says 10pm and one says 10:30pm. Just thought the managers should be aware.... only lazy workers close their doors 30 min or maybe an hour before closing time. Booo you suck. Honestly not coming back to this location, that's just stupid and lazy. Don't say your open till 10 or 10:30pm but close your doors at 9:30pm."}
{"text":"Food was good but take out counter let me sit about 10 minutes while my order sat in a bag in view that entire time. Two servers just standing around chatting."}
{"text":"It honestly blows my mind a place like pei Wei would just be closed... At 1pm... When they \"open\" at 11. It blows my mind, because this isn't the first time. It's the 3rd, in the last year or so. It's sad. I sat in my car looking on my phone for a new place and at least 30 people tried your locked doors. I don't even want to plan on going to a people Wei because of this. Shame on pei Wei. You should have better business sense than this, you aren't a little mom n pop shop, but that's where I'm going now!"}
{"text":"My wife gave birth down the street at banner gateway. After not getting to eat for 2 days, she was thrilled there was a pei wei close by as she has been vegitarian 15 or so years and they have some options. Got our food. Brought it back to the hospital and while mine was utterly tasteless, like they ran out of sauce to cook it in; my wife's had 3 pieces of beef. Not small pieces, like clearly intentional or just completely neglegent in the kitchen. She threw it away and resorted to the hospital cafeteria food. Shame on you pei wei Dana park. Do better."}
{"text":"Have not even received my food yet and already having a bad experience.  The soda machine was completely out of all diet drinks.  So I went to the front to let her know and she pointed at someone else and said tell her.  Because that is my job? Then when I'm trying to tell the other person how I was treated she was rude and snapped at me.  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and i really like it!  The place is very clean, including the bathrooms.  Many different choices and always very good. They really do have the beast crab won tons i have ever had.                     A lot of places just put fillers and a lot of won ton. But these are full of crab and very good.  Really good hot tea as well. Very inexpensive place to go. Lots of parking in the lot."}
{"text":"Beware!! The 1st time I ordered lettuce wraps, I found a tooth-sized rock in the chicken mix - and I found it the hard way. The 2nd time I ordered lettuce wraps, months later on a second chance visit, I found a chicken bone shard in the chicken mix. 

The rice/noodle bowls are almost entirely rice/noodles, very little meat/vegetables. The large sized dumpling soup had 5 tiny dumplings and a huge amount of broth. The lemon wedges for waters were brown, the bathroom was disgusting.

Do your tastebuds (and teeth) a favor, and pay a little bit more for the chain's higher scale restaurant, P.F. Changs."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here at Pei Wei I love it more and more. If you haven't tried it, you must! We used to have one in Northern California, but it closed down, and I miss it. So when I am in town I come here and enjoy their food, friendly service, and the cleanliness of this restaurant. They always have customers and are fast and efficient. As you can see I have nothing but good things to say about Pei Wei's on N. Dysart rd. Avondale, AZ 85323. But don't believe my word come out and experience it for yourself and bring your family and friends we do. Yours truly, Shelley"}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for a little asian fusion I call on Pei Wei to bring me some cheap and good food. They have a little of everything and I have discovered that the best dish is a toss up between the Cream Cheese Rangoons and the Crispy Honey Shrimp. 

I love the self serve sauces and complimentary fortune cookies. I always go for two."}
{"text":"We went to dinner there last night we like the food very much always dependably good quality and tasty. However the last two times we have been I question the management of this location . Last night it wasn't that busy but the table was dirty . It was extremely sticky , it had not been wiped down properly . Then when they brought my husbands dinner they said we are out of white rice and it would be 20 minutes  they did offer another option but it took several minutes before they brought that to him . I feel they should have told him that long before they brought out the entree . That way it could have been served together . Our previous visit a month ago was also unusual for them . After a very long wait for our dinner it was realized they had misplaced our order . They quickly then completed the order but absolutely no apology was given , poor customer service . May need to take our business elsewhere ."}
{"text":"Decent food, but don't order the sushi unless what you really want is rice role with a small portion of fish."}
{"text":"Not worth the outrageous price spent 60 dollars for 4 people nothing blew my away with the food very average better just to go to a authentic Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Pei wei! The closes thing to thai I can get my husband to eat. We get the same thing all the time, everytime=pad thai with tofu. It comes out in a HUGE steaming bowl of deliciousness. You dress it up how you like (hot sauce, lime etc all available on the side next to the soda machine). 

And finish off the meal for under 7 each. Though, it usually becomes my lunch for the next day too. Servings are HUGE

The service is courteous and prompt....Ill be back"}
{"text":"Just got served raw chicken. I will never eat here again. Praying I don't get Salmonella Poisoning."}
{"text":"This location is great for take out. I always order online to pickup and so far it has been ready each time.   To date, they've gotten every single one of my orders correct even with special modifications."}
{"text":"Delicious!! All vegetables are fresh, meats are tender, nice food presentation. Kids eat fee on Wednesday after 4pm."}
{"text":"My favorite Pei Wei in the Phoenix area. Consistent, accurate, and always welcoming! Friendly employees, Hector was very helpful!"}
{"text":"Love the food at any Pei Wei BUT this one looks ran down. Every booth has torn seats or the seat is detached and slides around. The high chairs are nasty and need to be replaced. I seriously hope they don't use the pots that hang above the bar because they are coated in dust. It seems like no money is being put back into this place. I HATE eating in this Pei Wei and will now only get my food to go."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at Pei Wei. This has been a favorite of mine for a couple years. The service today was fast. The only issue is the fact the I asked for two sauces, which actually was offered first and I accepted. When the food can to my table only one sauce was there. No a huge deal, but if offered it should arrive. My favorite are the wasabi crunch rolls."}
{"text":"Don't bother with togo orders here, I sat in hold for over 15 mins before I quit trying. Management has never been particularly friendly either. Love the food but hate everything else about this place."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at this establishment ever since it opened. I returned home from a summer on the pacific coast to an unfortunate surprise. Everything has changed! They no longer provide vinegar for spicing up the hot and sour soup, provide large spoons for serving large bowls and the large bowels are now about 1-3 smaller than previously served. The spicy chicken salad has also changed with an over abundance of shredded carrots and shredded cucumbers. We have some very good Asian restaurants in the valley in close proximity to this establishment. So in the future I will frequent other alternatives and list this place as \"No Wei\"  instead of Pei Wei!!!!!'"}
{"text":"Very disappointed at this location which is unfortunate because I LOVE PEI WEI. I always get a salad, frequently I get the Asian chopped salad with the pei Wei spicy chicken which isn't that difficult but the staff made it seem like it was the end of the world to ask for such a thing (even though I've ordered it frequently at other pei Wei locations). Then we received our salads which were suppose to be the regular size but when they came out it had to of been small because it was tiny with only a few pieces of lettuce and few chicken pieces but ok np. I kindly asked if this was the small and they were like no that's the regular very sarcastically. There's no way that was the regular because any smaller would not have been worth purchasing . I literally had to take it to go because it was all drenched but no lettuce so I went home and used my own lettuce to make it an actual salad. Very disappointed. 

The waiter was nice... that's about it."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Good experience. I had the chicken chow me in and my husband had the Mongolian beef with fried rice. Nice sized portions. No skimming on the meat.Just order up your food, sit down and the food is brought to you. Serve yourself drinks."}
{"text":"The Mongolian beef and Shrimp combination is to die for! This was one stellar plate indeed!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Free kids meals on Wednesdays! Not bad when you're craving PF Chang but don't have the time or money. The orange peel shrimp and Mongolian beef were pretty comparable to its parent company's! We will definitely get take out a lot!"}
{"text":"Generally we enjoy the food and atmosphere.  But tonight when we ordered we were told we'd have to wait 30 min before our food would arrive once ordehowever restaurant only 3/4 full.  We were told that they were backed up w/to go orders.  One would think patrons in the restaurant would have priority.  Disappointing!!bad internet"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Pei Wei, it was a a-ok experience. Food was good, love the Sushi. So for me it was fresh from the Wok nice and hot. It's a Chinese restaurant, all I saw cooking were latinos I was huh? Oh well pretty good cooking tho. I will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Like their new renovated location, lighter colors and modern setup. Mongolian or Orange chicken and lettuce wraps always flavorful. Like most restaurants out there they can go easier on the salt. Friendly staff and the kitchen moves fast, rarely waiting more than a few minutes. Their pickup works flawlessly."}
{"text":"Only got two stars because they refunded all our money back. Not only did they have to redo my husbands dish twice (once because they added peanuts when he said not to, second time because it was under cooked!) but my pad Thai basically should've been called noodles doused I lime. -0- flavor complexity whatsoever! It was literally sour with more sour. Never again, as said they were courteous enough to refund our money so that's the two star reason otherwise would've given less."}
{"text":"I feel bad that I haven't written this review sooner...the manager really deserves some recognition. 

I have celiac which requires me to order gluten free food. Pei Wei provides quality gluten free options and though the gf menu is rather small, I'm always satisfied. 

A couple months ago, my little sister and I decided to call ahead to get take out. When we arrived we were told it would be about 10 minutes.
I'm perfectly used to waiting longer for gluten free food. I understand that it takes a couple minutes longer because the cooks have to change their gloves, change pots and pans to prevent cross contamination ect ect. So we waited maybe a minute or two over ten minutes and I really couldn't have cared less. However the manager was so very apologetic for the delay explaining that they had to remake mine because it got contaminated. Hey I'm perfectly willing to wait a couple extra minutes to not get poisoned!! I told him everything was fine and he proceeded to give me a $10 gift card just for the short delay. I didn't even make a peep about waiting and yet he made it clear that he cared and we were important and that means a lot! 
I wish I had asked his name but I didn't :( so if you ever read this sir, thank you! 

And about the food...yeah it's awesome. I love the sweet and sour combo (chicken and shrimp) on white rice or the spicy chicken!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.. the Avondale location has really gone down hill. Place an online order not only do they get it wrong but it sits on the counter and no one says anything about it being ready. I had to ask how much longer will it be only to find out it's been sitting there all along!!!! By this time my food is cold on the counter. The place is just filthy. Floors, and tables are disgusting. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Super fast service, this is the place to go when you are really hungry.  Great portions and menu make it for a sit down-fast food combo that will make sense when you taste the amazing fusion of their dishes."}
{"text":"Had lunch at 4:30pm today had a Pa Thai and it was the best one I've ever had there!  Dude has it going on!"}
{"text":"I give one star for cool soda dispenser.
We could not finish our meals. Chewy beef,Salty fried rice,too dry white rice,
We do not have iron stomach to digest their food."}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was great food for the price.  Quite impressed by the variety of options on the menu. Not sure if this location was the one I tried."}
{"text":"First of all, I LOVE Pei Wei's food. That's why this location received 3 stars. Went here with my boyfriend who's never had Pei Wei. We walk in and are looking at the menu for not even 1 minute and a employee comes up to us and tells us, \"we close in 15 minutes, so unless your getting the order to go....\" and left it at that. I am a paying customer, or what would have been, who got turned away even though I've worked in the serving industry and know that no one leaves right when the restaurant closes. Needless to say, we left so that gentleman could leave work on time and spent our money next door at Pita Jungle where we were appreciated."}
{"text":"I have reviewed this place and gave it 3 stars the first time, well after numerous experiences after that, this place has sadly fallen from that.  I can tolerate mediocre American-Chinese food for a week night dinner, but I won't put up with horse sh*t customer service from this establishment.  As mentioned coming from a Asian background, I think this place is average at best, but my fiancee really likes it, but this will be the last time we put up with this place.  We mostly get our meals to go, considering when you walk in this place, there is a strong smell of sewage.  Tonight we ordered 3 different dishes, Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken and Honey Seared Chicken.  The food we brought back was extremely salty and the beef in the dish has a old and had a rotten smell to it.  It was very pungent and virtually inedible.  The honey seared chicken had the batter fall off and the chicken was very mushy.  The Kung Pao Chicken was the only dish tolerable.  The meal was a disgrace and left me extremely p*ssed off.  To top that off, I had to deal with some snotty brat kid at the counter.  I requested some red chile paste to go, but she refused and said they are no longer allowed to give it to customers that are ordering to go?  I said are you serious?  I asked, well you can charge it to my card and I'll pay for it.  They offered some red chile paste in the packets, but they taste like crap.  After thinking about it, I said forget it, this is freaking stupid that I would have to pay for that.  It's a matter off principle.  So, tonight is the last straw.  I refuse to pay for this crap every again.  I don't give many one star reviews but the combination of p*ss poor customer service and border line rotten meat, this place earned it!

We've ordered at this location multiple times in the past, but now they refuse to give out red Chile paste is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I paid 13 dollars and didn't get everything I ordered to go. Now they are closed and there is nothing I can do about it."}
{"text":"Wow! Great experience. Staff was super friendly & helpful. This Pei Wei always provides great service, not to mention delicious food. Shout out to the management, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't think I will come to this Pei Wei again. First of all several tables were dirty in the dining area. Second the ice machine was broken. Ok no big deal but they did not have a sign up nor were they telling people when ordering. People would walk over and be so confused why they couldn't get ice and had to walk over to employee to ask them and he was like \"oh it's broken\" well no shit. They should be at least informing people because I saw several customers goes through the same thing. I think telling people up front when they order a drink that if they want ice they need to get it for them in the back would have been a good way to handle this. 

My next issue. I ordered a Pei Wei spicy chicken. It comes with snap peas and carrots. I asked to swap carrots for mushrooms. After waiting longer than normal for my food it has no snap peas. Okay.. so I ask why. He says they don't have any. I then ask for side of broccoli even though I may have changed order had I known they were out because it one of my favorite parts of the dish. So I'm sitting here after I finish my food and see several dishes come out with guess what?! Snap peas. Not happy with this Pei Wei at all. They should be running things better than this. 

I go to leave and grab a fortune cookie. The bowl is pretty much empty and dirty with crumbs all over the bottom. Grab one of the few cookies left and it's stale and nasty. 

Yeah I won't be back here again. If you're craving Pei Wei head to the one on Sunset and Stephanie instead."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Pei Wei locations all over the Valley for years and years. After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. 

A few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  

I called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.

A month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.

Tonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.  

I don't think we will be going back anytime soon - at least not to this location - they really need to get it together.  We're tired of the issues every time we eat in or get take-out from here."}
{"text":"Step up from fast food. I've eaten hear a few times. Don't come if you're in a hurry. 30-40 minute wait times almost every time I've come. After waiting 50 minutes tonight I'm not sure I'll come back."}
{"text":"I thought the prices here were very reasonable, and the teriyaki bowl was delicious: the meat was very tender and the vegetables were fresh and crisp. I hope they expand their menu in the future."}
{"text":"Awful food and tasteless, I can't believe PF Chang's owns it. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a bit, and maybe our memories are kind, but I won't be back. Our trip started out with a long line due to only one register being able to take a card, not their fault. The blond manager? Was not the nicest. Finding a table for 4 was the next obstacle, busboys need to wipe down seats as well. Soda machines were mostly empty, and btw they ran out of egg rolls. The young man who was cleaning tables, restocking clean plates to the pass and bringing food to the tables needs to be taught to keep his hands out of his hair and wear a hat. The only saving grace, and reason for a 2 was the food."}
{"text":"Service takes long, my boyfriend got his food 15 minutes before I got mine. Other tables had the same issue. I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles, the description seemed promising but when I got it it seemed like soup not a noodle vegetable dish."}
{"text":"Walked in to dine in at 8:33pm. This location closes at 9:30pm. As we were looking to order off the menu we were asked if we were going to dine in, as we replied yes we were told that it would be over an hour wait as online orders took preference. Pretty bad when someone drives 20 minutes  expecting to have dinner at a restaurant only to be told that online orders have taken over and they wouldn't be able to serve for an extended period of time. Totally unacceptable and quite upsetting. I wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"It's better since they have changed it back from the Asian Market concept to the Asian Diner concept.  No more stupid only to-go containers and tiny food portions!  The \"special\" items like the sandwiches weren't that good.

Honey seared (battered and fried, really) shrimp was okay (though over sauced and got really sweet/heavy near the end), but lacked the chili oil kick and rice stick crunch it was supposed to come with.  Brown rice was well cooked.  Snickerdoodle cookie was tasty.  Water cup was tiny, and their water irks me in that you have to load the cup with ice as the water comes out warm.  The cashier didn't know what was in menu items and directed me to the takeout menu that listed ingredients.

Sadly, they keep removing things from the menu, including my mom's favorite Korean beef lettuce wraps.  She said the current chicken ones are too bland."}
{"text":"I came in and ordered a wok entrée with vegetables and tofu with sesame sauce with brown rice and it tasted too salty to eat. The whole thing was drenched in sauce it seemed more like a soup in a plate. Also got the chicken lettuce wrap and it was just half a lettuce head with shitty citrus ground chicken that was also salty as well. The sweet and sour soup tasted like a cambells beef canned soup. Disgusting food. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"A good, quick dose of Asian inspiration that hits the spot. The restaurant is under renovation but it hasn't affected the service or the seating. Food was served hot and good. Gluten free options including gluten free soy sauce. A staple, inexpensive sit down."}
{"text":"Well this is disturbing! I was about to dive into my Chicken Teriyaki and found a fly. I'm grossed out and WON'T be back! The guy cashier had a annoyed look when I picked up my food. The Thai soup was good and my boyfriend's food wasn't too bad. They cashier full of angst and the fly is enough to not go back!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Pei Wei customer for at least half a decade now. Every Pei Wei that I have visited before has been amazing and I have had no issues. For some reason, this one falls so short on customer service that it just drove me away from the chain completely. I had a similar issue as one of the previous reviewers with a coupon of Pei Wei's not being honored by their restaurant or not applying to the order. However, it wasn't just that part that put me off...it was the attitude of the workers and the manager in general. I placed an order online and came in when there was pretty much no one else in the restaurant. When I came up to the register to get my food, I was treated as if I was a nuisance or that I was interrupting the \"oh so busy\" manager - who, might I add, was dicking around on his phone at the time. I mentioned that I had a coupon and the manager just said \"uh huh..\" in a very annoyed tone and basically grabbed my phone out of my hands to scan it. He never asked me for my phone number so that I could get Wei Rewards points from the order either. I was honestly too afraid to ask because I didn't want to deal with anymore of his piss-poor attitude. If this Pei Wei did a serious overhaul and put the manager in some basic customer service courses or canned him altogether, this place might have a chance again from me. As of right now, I'm NEVER dining at Pei Wei again."}
{"text":"If you've read the other reviews for this location, you can see the common flaw is the service here. 

I waited over an hour for my to-go order when I was quoted 15 min at the time of ordering. They seem extremely understaffed and the people there were moving at a snails pace for the lunch rush. I wasn't the only person experiencing issues. A lot of people dinning-in weren't receiving their food either. 

When I asked to talk to a manager, I was told, \"We don't have one right now.\" For the quality, it's definitely not worth an hour wait."}
{"text":"I used to frequent and love this place ! But you took away the menu with pics and customers are confused and now the line to order is long because customers have to ask do many questions! Add pics to the menu board you dummies."}
{"text":"Service is slow!!! Only one young kid working the counter with a long line out the door on a Saturday night. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Pei Wei in quite awhile.  Dan Dan noodles were good, but a tad salty."}
{"text":"So I came here because my girlfriend convinced me to try it out. I am absolutely disappointed. They may have the Chinese décor but they do not have the cooking skills. The rice was way too soggy as if they had used too much water. The Mongolian beef and the sauce were just as disappointing. The Mongolian beef was way too crunchy and the sauce that came with it only succeeded in putting a disgusting taste in my mouth. I tried to give them a half a star, but my girlfriend informed me the minimum rating that was available is a half star. It is sad to say but my Chai Black Tea was the only good thing at came from my visit here. I will most definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"This kind of food isn't my favorite, but I did enjoy the crab wontons here as well as their Japanese offerings. The prices are a little high for what it is, but not too bad. I would probably return every once in awhile when I feel like Asian food."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pei Wei for quite some time at the location in Orange County, no problems. Until tonight, I experienced the worst service at the Phoenix location. Your food may be good, but your service needs a lot of work. I put in an order on the web and you guys completely forgot about me. I never got an apology or moment of concern regarding my order. I had to wait for you to re-cook my meal which was supposed to be done 25 minutes ago. Your service sucks and I never should had paid full price for my meal. If I wasn't in such a hurry to go to dance (which I missed anyway because i had to wait an extra 25 minutes) I honestly would have complained in person. Sure I'll give you another shot, but If it happens again, don't expect me to give you any time of day or my business. I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I eat here fairly regularly because it's a good place to get a lot of veggies.  Sometimes it's really good and other times I've found pieces of meat in my \"vegetarian\" dish, hence the 3 stars.  Some of the staff have told me the quinoa is not vegetarian because of the sauce, and others say no it's already vegetarian.  It's really confusing and inconsistent.  I do appreciate those who have double checked for me, even if they are getting inconsistent information.  It would be really great if the management would educate all their folks consistently.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei.  I normally order to take out.  The servings are generous.  I always get two meals out of a serving.  I like that they have brown rice as an option.  The lettuce wraps are fabulous and I'm a fan of the chicken pad thai.

The down side is this particular Pei Wei seems very inconsistent in their product.  Sometimes the sauce if excessive and it is a soupy mess.  Sometimes so little sauce that the meal is dry.  The dishes are sometimes too salty, or too smoky tasting.  Don't you use a recipe?"}
{"text":"I only gave thus pei Wei 3 stars because the food was good and they have the cool soda fountains.  The customer service was atrocious. The girl who took our order up front barely made eye contact and was eager to end our transaction...even though no one was behind us. 

Then the girl who ran our food out asked if we order 6 pot stickers. We did. She placed our plate down, and there were FIVE! She just asked if we ordered 6. When she passed back through we told her we only got five and she brought the other one out. I mean it's not a huge deal. People get busy. Accidents happen. I was just annoyed that she seemed like she couldn't be bothered to get our missing item. 

Ughhh. This place. Worst customer service I wish TOTT's would have prevailed in this plaza and not a corporate monster."}
{"text":"This Pei Wei is consistant with it's orders being correct & clean. My one wish is that the parking lot it shares with Starbucks & Sidebar were about 15 cars larger. I don't see that happening but a girl can wish can't she?"}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews but I it's only right that customers see this information.  First, the place is not clean; sticky floors, sticky chairs, and sticky tables.  There was food on the floor and no one bothering to clean it up.  Someone wiped several chairs and also the bench seat with food and foot prints and then used the same rag to wipe the tables. The bench seat is made of vinyl and it was cracked and torn.  Second, the food quality has changed. The Caramel chicken is now too tangy and instead of the fresh julienne vegetables it now has something that looks like coleslaw.  The Kung Pao was somewhat dry (use to have more sauce).  Both dishes were on a bed of dry and hard rice.  I was looking around the restaurant and I noticed there is  no manager overseeing the operation.  Truly disappointing since this place use to be decent and best of all it's in our neighborhood.  I can put up with food that is not too good but when a place is dirty, no way.  They just lost a customer!"}
{"text":"always great food and they will prepare just the way you ask.

Sometimes I ask for Dan Dan noodles a little less spicy, or chicken a little more crispy and they do it nicely every time.

It's usually pretty busy during meal times so sometimes it's hard to find a seat, but if you have a few minutes to wait it's no problem at all."}
{"text":"Gave them a second try after a long while, still BAD! Ordered 2 poke bowls, rice is raw. Sent it back to he kitchen, got a new set and rice is so hard and raw.

The fish is the only one supposed to be raw on a poke bowl.

------

We've been coming here often and get bad service every time. I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, until my kids made unsolicited comment that  staff here don't like their job. 

They have Polynesian bowl on the menu, which is supposed to have guacamole. Our order didn't come with guacamole. When we brought it to their attention, we were given 2 different responses- the Poke bowl don't come with guacamole, and they ran out of guacamole. No apologies or anything, cashier was even arrogant. 

They didn't even make the effort to buy avocado from local store? One-fourth of their menu have avocado? What about the avocado salad?"}
{"text":"I love this place! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the wait time. For a chain restaurant as big as Pei Wei, one would think that the wait would be shorter. It's not unbearable, but can take up to 30 min on a busy day, and this place is quite busy since they're the 3rd most profiting Pei Wei in the US. That definitely shouldn't stop you from coming. The food is vegetarian and vegan and gluten-free friendly. The sushi is good for the price. My favorite dish is the Ahi Avocado Salad. Oh and the Mexican waiter (sorry forgot his name) is so sweet. My mom had mistakenly ordered the wrong meal and had it confused in her head. When he brought it out to her and she thought it was the wrong thing, he politely cleared up her confusion and even brought us the dish that she had confused it with! What an angel and a joy. Again, only downfall of this place is how busy it can get. But remember it's busy for a reason."}
{"text":"I always love Pei Wei, the food is fresh, there's always new variety.  This Pei Wei is always clean, service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Other chain restaurants do not compare. Price is excelente for the quality and taste of food. We do not have Pei Wei in Yuma, AZ (where we are from) but we stop at Pei Wei every time we are in Phoenix. We just love it that much.  Both of my kids, one who is 13 years old and the other 6 years old, enjoy this place just as much as I do.  Everyone must try it! Very flavorful."}
{"text":"I had heard this is a great place, the person even compared it to PF Changs. I had been looking so forward to trying it... So disappointed. Not even close to the same class as PF Changs. Won't be coming back. Do NOT get the Won Ton soup. No flavor."}
{"text":"This location is awful! The food is sooooo bad compared to the other two locations my husband and I eat at. Unfortunately it's the closest to our house so we are forced to eat here. They give you about 5 pieces of chicken on the entree, compared to other locations who have a decent portion size. Tonight the cashier was arguing with me that my chicken chopped salad should be smaller than the entree salad that comes as a substitute for rice. Check out my tiny chopped salad. Who she continuously argued with me was the right size (smaller than the side salad). It's been years of a terrible experience here so I doubt it will ever get fixed."}
{"text":"Ordered Togo the beef fried rice. The rice was undercook and tough to chew. Quality had gone down the last time we ordered from here. Had to microwave our rice so it can be softer to eat. Probably won't order from this Pei Wei for a while."}
{"text":"This evening my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some takeout on our way home from Christmas shopping. We walked in the takeout door into a chaotic mess. After 10 minutes of waiting in \"line,\" we were finally greeted at the register. I say \"line\" because it was really more of a cluster of customers being randomly waited on by one of four confused Pei Wei employees.  While attempting to place our order, I repeated \"chicken\" about four times because the young man questioned what kind of protein I wanted in my \"kung pao chicken.\" Um, chicken in my kung pao chicken please. When my boyfriend attempted to order his spicy Korean steak, the young man spaced out and could not comprehend \"steak.\" \"Steak? What do you mean, steak?\" A young woman walked over and scolded, er, showed him how to enter the entree. \"He wants steak!\" Young man: \"He didn't specify that!\" Young woman to my boyfriend: \"It helps if you order backwards from the order of the menu.\" After the awkwardness settled, the two employees then parted ways from the register and left us unable to complete our order. They both continued to wait on other patrons in the \"line\" and completely ignored my question of \"Um, can we complete our order?\" We stood there as I glared at any employee who even slightly made eye contact. Still nothing. We left. The restaurant business is too competitive for this location to operate in such a terrible way."}
{"text":"Guessing phone system problems. Decided to do takeout tonight. Called 4 time over a 15 min window. Phone simply rang and rang. No answer on any attempt."}
{"text":"Typically, I love the food at Pei Wei!  However, this past week I ordered my old stand by, Kung Pao chicken and ordered without scallions or any onions.  When I received my order in the dining room, I noticed that they put scallions in it. I walked up to the pass to notify the expediters and they couldn't have cared less.  I asked them to please remake it and he said he's be right over.  It was 10 minutes before he came to my table and asked what the problem was.  By then, my kids were already done with their meal.  It was almost 20 minutes before he brought me back my food, with no apologies, no customer service at all. When I asked for a to go box since my entire family was done, he acted bothered and irritated as if I should have just ordered it that way in the first place. After all of that, when I got home it was gross. They not only held the scallions (as originally ordered!) but they also held the flavor.  None whatsoever on this expectedly spicy dish. My baby could have eaten it. I won't be returning to this location, for SURE!"}
{"text":"I don't even care about authenticity issues.  I'd eat a sushi filled with a taco if it was delicious.  the food here is just criminally bland."}
{"text":"Had another wonderful encounter here.  Never had a bad one!  The place has always been spotlessly clean.  Management sees the customer trends and adapts accordingly.  For instance there are now smaller portions to the entrees and the new Coca-Cola soda machines with the billion+ flavor combos.  I ordered just the 2-piece crab wontons (stuffed with the good crab and lots of it!) and a small Mongolian Beef.  One of the best Mongolian sauces I've had!  I noticed they don't have fortune cookies out at the condiment station but I can only assume that would be due to selfish customers grabbing 1 for each person in their entire extended family.
Great place, I ALWAYS recommend this as the cheaper alternative to P.F. Chang's but with the same quality food!"}
{"text":"Great meal ! I was pleased with the speed of service and taste of food ! Sweet and sour soup was delicious and plentiful.  I liked how fast plate came out of kitchen . Great overall."}
{"text":"I'm giving Pei Wei four stars because if I really wanted authentic Asian, then I'd go somewhere else for authentic Asian.  Pei Wei isn't bad at all, especially if you know exactly what you want when you walk in and you know what you're getting for the money.  It's a \"slightly slower fast food\" joint (I don't put Pei Wei in the same category as McDonald's or BK, because it's not) and I have to throw Pei Wei a bone because they do offer plenty of vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Pei Wei is a go-to when I want carry-out and I want it simple and clean and I don't have to think too much about what I want.  I know it won't disappoint and I'll usually have leftovers for the next day (you shouldn't leave Pei Wei hungry, as the servings are only slightly smaller than a bass boat).  

I'm not one to do Pei Wei every week, however it's not bad at all when I don't feel like cooking and just want to stay in with some good carry-out."}
{"text":"I am being generous with two stars as we have been eating at Pei Wei for probably 8 years and most times would give 31/2 stars.Last night was the WORST meal we have ever had from there. Below is a list:

* no lettuce wrap sauce included for my TWO letter wrap orders.
* no won ton chips to top the chicken salad.
* the chicken on the salad tasted and had the texture of canned chicken- gross!!
* one of the lettuce wrap orders was made with ground chicken (which it does not say on the menu) t was disgusting- hard to chew and tasted old
* the kids honey seared chicken looked nothing like it has look thefts 20 times we ordered ( cook may just be inventing stuff at this point) Random veggies on top.
* Vietnamese salad rolls falling apart and the ingredients indie stale and not fresh.

This as a HUGE step down for this restaurant that should have higher standards.Management should be paying attention to employees that are not ding their job, and cooks should know when ingredients are stale, old and just wrong.  Total waste of money. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We dont have this chain in Northern California so we tried it out while we were in Phoenix. It was a pleasant surprise! Nice selection of items, great kids meals, all with adequate portions. We did take out but it was nice in the restaurant and I would have liked to have eaten in instead."}
{"text":"My family and I have visited many times and every time we get great service and great food. They have many great promotions as well. The people work very hard, especially due to the restaurant having many clients."}
{"text":"We used to do Pei Wei at least twice a month for take out. The food was always excellent. We haven't ordered from there in a couple years. My son and I went there for dinner last night. The service was pathetic.I ordered a chicken salad, the chicken had no taste, it was a poor quality, they bathed the salad in a sweet sauce. The worst part was both my son and I were sick for the next 12 hours. Pei Wei will not make it back on to our take out list. Management this location needs help"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a glorified Asian Restaurant.  The food here is hit or miss. The wait sometimes is up too 30-45mins sometimes. I appreciate that they want to cook your order fresh, I just wish it wasn't such a long wait at times. The staff seems pretty friendly for the most part."}
{"text":"Here we go again.  Decided to try one more time and wow, service was even worse than the last time.  Tried to order online and website was not working. Called in and placed an order with a very unprofessional lady.  quoted 20 minutes and it took 45 minutes +.  I am done and will find another place for asian food. I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"Too bad, service has gone down hill the past month or so and food has started to be sloppy and always wrong order.  They need help!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, as usual. I hadn't been here in awhile and the menu had changed. I got the spicy chicken, which is the Pie Wei Original. I also ordered pork egg rolls, which were full of pork and not just all veggies. I would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good, nothing that will blow you away but Pei-Wei is pretty good for a lunch.  

The best thing is that this is not a premade line with a steam table.  Orders are prepared when ordered, with five or six line cooks woking dishes together.  It's not gourmet but it's not supposed to be.  I will be back, if nothing else it's better than that Panda place."}
{"text":"What happened? In less than three years this place is a dump. The floors were filthy. The tables trashy. The food was cold and slip on the the plates. The service was slow and the staff clueless. Yikes!"}
{"text":"My food was raw and my Mongolia beef has no sauce. Also, my honey seared chicken was grease, under cook and though. I called to complain and the manager never pick up. I will never go back again!"}
{"text":"Rangoons were a bit fishy and sushi was a bit off. Sesame steak rice bowl was good though. Average for a Pei Wei - great location in Scottsdale though."}
{"text":"This one of my favorites places to eat at. I really love all their dishes. I like their tea and their new soda machine."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  This was our first visit to Pei Wei.  I ordered two different sushi rolls.  Hubby ordered a beef and shrimp noodle bowl.  And we shared crab rangoon.  The sushi rolls were obviously pre-made as they were cold instead of room temperature and looked like they'd been sitting around a while..  The flavor was nothing exciting either.  Hubby really enjoyed his noodle bowl, though.  Spicy and flavorful.  The crab rangoon were actually better than expected, and better than those \"crab puffs\" that every Chinese place seems to have around here.  Still not as good as what we had on the east coast, but better than most around here. Service at the register was nothing spectacular, but the girl monitoring the dining room, was friendly and professional.  Overall, just ok.  Not saying we won't eat here again, but it won't be at the top of the list  and I won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, everything was fresh and delicious.  At some point in the past couple years it went down hill.  I can't even get my wife to give it another chance.  I know it's supposed to be quick food but now is fast food.  Not good."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The atmosphere is comfortable and kind of new age Asian. The food was really good and the service was refreshing. I'm pretty sure this place would have gotten a 3 star if it wasn't for the Hostess/Cashier Maria. She was very nice and went along with our jokes. She also helped me decide what I wanted to eat which was very helpful."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town- and a chain too. I love how fresh and traditional wok style pei wei is. I always get the kung pao chicken with fried rice- under $10 and lots of food. Always fast service and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Great Food at a reasonable price. Excellent choices for Vegetarians! Order at the counter & have a seat. A micro-version of P.F. Changs.
Fantastic for a quick pick-up to take home after a long day at work."}
{"text":"They change the place and the menu, we order our usual.  The price is about the same and the portion was smaller, the staff was not friendly.  I will not come back to this place.  My kids and I miss the OLD Pei Wei!!!  Why fix it if it is not broken!!!  WHY????"}
{"text":"Ordered food to-go. The staff was very friendly. The food was delicious. The only problem was I ordered lettuce wraps and when I got back there was no lettuce"}
{"text":"The food is great. My problem is with the service I get when I order takeout. I used to order takeout all the time but had to stop because the staff would constantly get my pickup time wrong and I'd have to wait for my food 10+ minutes. There have also been numerous times I had to go back to the restaurant once I got home because part of my order wasn't in the bag (my fault for not double checking what's in the bag I guess but when they read my order to me, I expect all the food to be in there).
The last time I got takeout from Pei Wei, I was on hold for 5-10 minutes waiting to place an order. Since they were taking so long to take my call I decided to try to call with a different phone while I was on hold. They picked up immediately and took my order with my other phone. Once I was done ordering with the second phone they picked up my original call but I just hung up because I obviously didn't need to order again. 
Ordering takeout from this location was more of a hassle than it's worth and I haven't been back since. In the past, the manager has given me a gift card for their mistakes which was nice but it didn't change the service I got the next time I went there. I'm not looking for free food, I just want to eat dinner. It's been months since I've gotten food from Pei Wei so maybe things have changed but I doubt it because I haven't been back."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch. The food is better than most Pei Weis, we never have any problem as the food is cooked really well. I've noticed in the past year or so the portions have gotten smaller, while prices go up. The best thing about this place is the staff. They're always really nice and fast."}
{"text":"The food is consistent, tasty, hot and arrives as ordered. I do take down by a star for mediocre service. Not unusual to go in and wait for someone to take your order...while no other customer is in the place....overall good weekday dinner with some tasty healthy choices"}
{"text":"We love Pei Wei but this location was extremely dirty. We tried to sit outside and every chair and table was filled with bird poop and the ground was littered with trash. Inside is not much better. We will probably drive to another location from now on."}
{"text":"After several (failed) attempts at take out here over the last few months we decided to dine in last night. The food is peiwei as usual and terrific but this location is lacking in work ethic. The floors were so sticky, at one point I walked out of my flip flop... I had to clean our table and a highchair myself, and they weren't even busy. As I mentioned, our past experience with take out has been less then great, be sure to check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"I went here to see if the orange chicken was way better like advertised, it's different than Panda Express, fresher. But really not ~better~ the staff was friendly pretty good service. There was only one fork but I can use chopsticks. If you upgrade $1.00 for fried rice they hook it up."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place, the food always taste fresh. I like the way they prepare it when you order. It gets a little pricey if you have multiple people. One or two is not too bad. I would definitely go back to this place. It's quick and good. The one thing they need to do is lay off the tofu in the pad thai. Please, do ever ever add those things and ruin my pad thai, thank you. Otherwise, good place to go with the family or by yourself."}
{"text":"For quick asian inspired dishes this is a great spot. Pad Thai is delicious and they have a wide variety of food (unlike other asian fast food spots). Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I can't understand why anyone would eat here.  I've been there 3 times and simply put this place is awful.  The potstickers are tasteless, but that is better than any of the noodle dishes.  Those noddles taste as if they were made from wallpaper glue.   
Totts Asian diner is right there and sooooo much better.  Yuphia thai is down the street as well.  Both are much better choices."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from Jacob. Thank you for being so helpful with our order. This was the Mr. Delgado order."}
{"text":"This is based on this location only. 

I go to Pei Wei about 1-2 days a week.
I repeatedly have issues with this location. Today being the worst. 

After 20 Mins of waiting (place is not busy at all) I advised staff i think my order was forgot. They laughed (seriously) said they made it but not sure where it went and ever apologized. Not one person. 
I'm sitting at their bar and management and all staff just looked at each other all laughing. 

This locAtion is always like this. Very lack luster,
Slower than most and doesn't bring anything to the table as far as customer service or energy."}
{"text":"I like this place when I am looking for a quick, consistent fix. I'm an adventurous person but when I find a dish somewhere that I like, I stick with it. I always want to walk on the wild side and try something new but I just can't quit the pad thai. I've only ordered variations of their Pad Thai and it's been great every single time. I just call and voila-pick it up in 10 to 15 minutes and I'm out the door. The portions are huge which usually leaves me some for another meal during the wk.

I know their parent company is the PF Changs and for some reason, I've never been there but after having Pei Wei's food, I am definitely adding it to my list!"}
{"text":"When you want a PF Changs fix but don't have the time or coin go to Pei Wei. Like all Pei Wei's I want fresh Asian cuisine fast this is the place I go to. Pad Thai is my newest love here. Order it with beef spicy with extra egg. The Vietnamese spring rolls are good. The sauce a little sweet so avoid that unless you like it that way. This location is both fast & clean. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I am a huge Pei Wei fan & this location is just as good as any other I've loved & tried over the years. This location has consistantly good food, service & value. Yum!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place needs to be shut down or under new management. This place is horrible. Took 50 minutes for our food to come out, my spring roll STILL has not come out. I know it doesnt take more than an hour for a spring roll to come out. They only had one cook and about 30 people all in here with empty food. THE WORSE PART IS I SAW A GUY SPIT IN SOMEONES TAKEOUT. Then when my food came I found a hair in it!! Of course! The waiter is the only nice guy. It's a same shame all these angry customers are yelling at him."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a restaurant my family and I go to regularly. We love their fried rice, wontons, and are usually never disappointed with the food or dining room appearance. Although, the last few times we've visited this location, it hasn't held up to our standards. Unfortunately, I feel this location has lost its sense of quality. 
When we walked in, we looked over the menu and headed to the ordering counter. The service was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and patient with my mother as she asked her many questions. While ordering, we were told that some items were taken off of the list, like the pot stickers, and they hadn't quite updated the menu yet. This wasn't a big deal to us, but it may be important to someone who only comes here for one specific item. We placed our order and headed to the soda machine before selecting our table. As a plus, the restaurant had a touchscreen coke machine, which gave us a variety of options to choose from. However, the drink counter was out of straws for us to use and the machine was out of ice-arguably two essentials for soda. On our way to the table, I also noticed many used wrappers for chopsticks, napkins, and bits of rice scattered around the floor of the dining room. However, since you get to choose your own seating here, we just sat in the cleanest corner. I should note this place does have a decent about of seating if you have a larger family with tables being able to seat 6.
Our food came out very quickly, with our wontons and entrees being delivered in less than 5 minutes. I loved the fast service, but would be willing to wait a little longer if it meant receiving a better quality meal. I understand, with most of the menu items being under $10, you shouldn't expect absolute perfection. However, I would have enjoyed my chicken fried rice a little more if it didn't have a long string of burnt egg in it (sorry, it's a little hard to see in the picture because of the lighting). My mother and sister's bowls of fried rice also had many chunks of white rice included, which threw off their meal's taste. When I was finished with my meal, I went to grab a box for my leftovers. Unfortunately, those were also out of stock.
I usually love going to Pei Wei and it was my first choice for dinner dates for a long time. However, with the lower quality food and dirty floors, in addition to hearing the cooks complain from the open kitchen, it doesn't really set a comfortable mood for me anymore. The service was excellent, fast, and seemed to know what they were doing. Perhaps this is a management issue? I have been to many other locations and not had these problems before. Hopefully this location can improve and reclaim its spot as my favorite Asian restaurant. [500 words]"}
{"text":"Really tasty, and a good variety on the menu. Food is served quickly and the place is always very clean. Love the crab cakes and spring rolls! I agree with the previous review about the parking lot, but you can't blame that on the restaurant really."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many a times now.  It is close to  my work, generally busy at lunch times. Each time I come I go with my regular order of Korean spicy chicken. On my last visit , I thought to try some other from their spice menu. So I picked pei wei spice which is the worst pick and made me scared to go pei wei .

First thing the food served is not very hot and they just poured hell lot of sweet sauce in my pick which is unbearable to eat. Never recommend their new inclusions on their menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pei wei store which you can see always neat and the staff are friendly. Perfect hosts!! This time my stars are for their peiwei spicy entrée on their wok classics. Generally I choose the spice rated options on the menu and Korean spicy being my favorite, we thought to try the peiwei spicy. To our shock , it have no spice levels but sweet vinegar sauce being dominated.

I would ask them to remove (SPICE flag) on this item which confuses a customer like me and now am scared to try pei wei for a week or two.

Note: There is a gift card bonus running at their stores which I would recommend ."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei!! They offer up some truly tummy Asian dishes! And the awesome thing about it is that no matter which location you go to, the food is consistently the same!
My favorite dish is the Kung Pao with tofu, brown rice and extra sauce on the side. Seriously, even folks who don't care for tofu will love this!
Thanks Pei Wei for being a mile from my work and easy to get to!!"}
{"text":"Part of the \"fast casual restaurant\" movement, you can get fresh food served quickly at a reasonable price. What's not to like?

I had the mongolian with lots of crisp-tender veggies, brown rice and a spicy sauce. SO good! My friend had the teriyaki and it wasn't overly sweet and cloying, and the chicken was fresh and tender. 

This particular store is a bit hidden in the shopping center, we found it by accident, but will be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, but they really need to up the fortune cookie game. Mine were the definition of weak sauce."}
{"text":"Pigeon on the outside tables please fix this problem. Baking soda and rice!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Use to be MUCH better before they changed the menu. But what was really off putting is that there was absolutely nothing on tables. ..no condiments & then when we asked for some soy sauce our request was met with the answer that they were cleaning all the containers, we were brought a little bowl of soy sauce.  it was about 8:40pm & they were closing up. If a business is open till whatever time...be open full service till then. Not 10 or 15 min before. It's just rude."}
{"text":"Second time in a row I placed a order through their app, showed up at the time it said it was ready, then waited 15-20 mins additionally. The first time it happened, they seemed busy so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The second time, wasn't very busy, and I still had to wait. The employees are very inattentive and unapologetic. They don't say sorry for the order being late, they just act like it's normal. The food is delicious but sadly the service is lacking. When the app says it will be ready at a certain time, then it's not even close, that is disappointing. The app even alerted me that the order had been changed from pending to completed, but apparently it's the \"one is the next orders\". When it was finally done, I let the girl know that when I paid for this, it said it would be ready at 8:05 and it was after 8:20, she responded with some serious attitude and said \"yeah well the kitchen just doesn't pay attention to the times.\" 
Unacceptable.
Then when I open my food at home, I swear they gave me a half portion when I ordered a regular size...
And no sweet and sour sauce for my egg rolls. Like seriously guys???"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location and getting take out for years and have always had an good experience, the Order is always right and the food taste good but the restaurant itself is become old and dingy, nothing feels 100% clean, it just doesn't seem like the staff takes pride in what they do. If your looking for decent food at an average restaurant this is the place."}
{"text":"It's not fancy Asian food. But it taste great. I compare other Thai / Asian food to this place. Never had a bad experience or incorrect order."}
{"text":"Stay away!!
I've eaten her 20 times at the gainey ranch location, but had not eaten there for about 4 months.  So I call in my order to go , I show up, they me they are out of what I ordered and ask me I would like to order?huh? I say no thanks I ordered to go because I was in a bit of a hurry.
Ok, a month later I try again, I go in to get my to go order. The guy at the register is struggling, but I pay, and see several to go orders sitting on the counter in bags ready to go. Instead of checking the bags to see if it's mine , or the guy in front of wait uh he says I'll be right with you and someone walks in the door he greets and asks what they want to order!! He did this one more time, me and the guy in front of walk to the bags and check the names on the bags and they are ours!!!! I get home and open the edamame, and it's hard, super cold, and bad!!!! I was pissed!!!!"}
{"text":"OK not too sure where I need to start with this but I have to say I love this place I love the food however when you set up a pick up time to pick up your food and you have to wait 30 to 45 minutes after your pick up time for your food it becomes a problem granted they were busy but if your pick up time you set for X time then your food should be ready there's no excuse for it and I'm sure that tonight on many people were not very happy I'm hoping this place gets her act together when it comes to this."}
{"text":"Was psyched to hear they have a gluten-free menu. Although there are only 2 flavors-Pei Wei Spicy & the sweet & sour. That's good for my SO since he likes sweet & sour. I'm not a s&s fan so I'm stuck with just rice- would have liked the spicy but it's made with chicken broth so not vegetarian friendly which explains why they only list meat options on their gluten-free menu. If they would switch to veggie broth then we would get takeout weekly. But I can't get satisfied with just rice so they lost my biz. Staff is friendly but some really have no clue about the gf menu - for take out they gave packets of regular soy sauce when they have gf tamari. 2 stars because they made an attempt, and with a few tweaks could be a 4 or even 5 star."}
{"text":"So I heard things had changed and went back to the way they used to be so I decided to try it again since its in my neighborhood. 

We'll, all that changed was that they brought back plates vs plastic take out.  I ordered a Chinese chicken salad and when I got it was served with the dressing on the side. I ask the young boy to have the chef \"toss\" my salad. He looked at my like I was crazy. When the salad returned it was exactly the same as when it left -- dry and untossed. 

I had to walk up to the cooks area to ask them to \"Toss my salad in the dressing\"....

Anyway, the whole environment  of this location is off - the flow of the restaurant is weird and I WONT BE BACK ever again. 

TOSSING a salad doesn't mean to puke your guts out - It means to toss the salad with the dressing.  

Do I really have to explain this?   I guess so...Just a weird experience and weird place."}
{"text":"I had an AWFUL experience on Friday! I placed an online order at 4 PM to pick up at 5 PM for two rice bowls and Vietnamese rolls. We ended up making two stops before we picked up the food, and despite being thirty minutes late, they forgot to include our rolls. I had to drive all the way back to get them. No apologies, no acknowledgement of their mistake, just, \"How many?\"

After waiting to get my replacement rolls (and watching the same cashier goof around and laugh, despite not trying to make things right with my order) she finally came back and handed me the missing rolls. She said, \"I looked back and saw you there and was wondering if you had been there the whole time.\" I felt like they really didn't care about me or my order. I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Food is always good here and quite fresh for fast food! Lots of choices with meat or without depending on your wants/needs.
   Service is prompt, the restaurant is clean and the food cooked to order. This is a spin off from PF Chang's so you do expect a certain amount of quality ~ or at least I do"}
{"text":"This is the worst pei wei to go to. Ordered food online which said it would be ready at 630. Showed up at 640 to wait in line for 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Only to be told that my food will still take another 20-30 minutes. Mind you, they were telling dine-in customers the same time... so they probably didn't start any internet orders. Staff was super rude about the whole issue and told me it's not their problem."}
{"text":"Horrible. Tried to call in and was #1 according to the phone but in the time it took me to drive from Hayden and Indian Bend they still hadn't answered. I get here, the take out employees are just standing around and they are out of what I want. Lol garbage."}
{"text":"Ordered a soft drink with my meal to go and they did not have lids. I asked for a refund since my to go beverage would not have a lid and it took a half hour to give me a refund."}
{"text":"Usually this place is one of our favorites, but lately it has been a terrible option for dinner. I called in and waited almost an hour along with about 15 other customers. One of the chef's told the girls in a front not to answer any more phone calls for call in orders. They were almost 40 minutes behind with phone orders. They weren't apologetic for being behind, they were quite actually rude the girls handling the food. I understand it can get hectic and crazy, but customer service should come first."}
{"text":"Usually Pei Wei would be up there in stars and its why I gave this one 2 instead on 0!  Worst location!  They messed up my carryout after telling the guy on the phone 3 TIMES no red pepper, usually never a problem but i had that feeling he wasn't listening, you guessed it i got red pepper!  This was of course with my COLD hot n sour soup and after my longer then usual bad service wait.  Stay away from thsi location.  i was so upset i sent an email and no response, no sorry, nothing.  LAME"}
{"text":"Restaurant is getting better over time. Food is still bland and basic and too much sausage as fillers, but the staff does not have a brain, terrible repeat customer loyalty discounts and they should know better how to treat high profile guests. Lots of work left to he done after they sold off from pf changs but if you want a Costco cafeteria style meal, that's the place."}
{"text":"Customer service and management are both much better after I called corporate. They are now showing marked improvement."}
{"text":"A friend has been a fan of Pei Wei. I hardly came here because my last visit few years ago was not great. I didn't like the food at all. Since a friend suggested this place, I gave it another try. The food is getting better and more selection this time. Although I find the shrimp and chicken quite salty their poke bowl is good and salad are fresh. Believe it or not, I even signed up for their reward member program. Haha."}
{"text":"I only came to this place because I have some coworkers that love this place so I went along.  Not ever having been here I decided to go with the Orange Chicken (white meat) entree with the fried rice.  The employee's at the counter taking my order were not that friendly but I made small talk with them and they seemed to be more friendlier...they must have been having a bad day or something.  My coworker's and I seated ourselves and when our food was ready it was brought over to us.  We got extra plates and shared some of our food with each other to see what we liked and disliked.
The food is ok...I mean it's not anything special.  Nothing really stood out to me like I must have this again.
All in all, they like to come here but then they must not enjoy eating great food!  I've had it twice and I most-likely won't go back unless I'm dragged again kicking and screaming!"}
{"text":"Now that ive been away from Phoenix for a while. I so miss Pei Wei. Theirs absolutely nothing like Pei Wei here in Portland nor Vancouver. 
Uncomplicated, healthy, and delicious. As well its priced reasonably. Get in the que order by choosing which meal you want pick your protein. Take a seat very shortly your food is deliverd to you.  I usually always got my sauces on the side as most of the time the sauce would over whelm the rice and make it too sweet. That way i can pour as much or as little sauce as i desired. They always have fresh not over cooked veggies. Big chunks of broccoli, sugar snap peas, carrots, fresh mushrooms,. And while i would always order extra veggies. I almost never left Pei Wei unsatisfied. And the prices were great. So if you were still hungry you could order some more. Not complicated streamline. Easy and seating is very comfortable and open. Self serve drinks with unlimited refills with no extra charge. Which included sodas, lemonade and 2 different organic gourmet green or black tea. 

The Portland and Vancouver area need Pei Wei desperately.  Please come to Portland.Im sure you'll have lots of fans here"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and stopped going because the food quality began to wane.  

I tried the new noodle bowl. A spicy steak and shrimp medley and I was impressed. Very spicy with tender steak and very well cooked shrimp. If that is all I would've had this night this would be a 4 1/2 star review. 

Unfortunately an order of spicy tuna sushi was ordered. The race was hard and the fish was subpar like both were frozen.  When asked if the sushi was frozen the waitress did not lie and stated that it was it was very disappointing.

She did make it right by replacing the sushi with a cup of soup which was 10 times better than that hard old sushi.  

The new noodle bowl does have me intrigued to try the other two but stay away from the sushi."}
{"text":"I generally avoid any type of chain but decided to make an exception and was glad I did. The Thai coconut curry was exceptionally good, I was really surprised. Think I will have to make an exception to my rule and come back here again."}
{"text":"The food was good. Never been to this chain before. I LOVED there Chai Tea with Vanilla and cinnamon! Soooo good! I love spicy food so I came here to eat. The place was very clean, there wasn't any forks but one of the staff got them for us. I would come back."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to say Pei-Wei is a good chain if you compare to the quality of other places of it's kind.

I walked in for lunch, and was surprised that they had brown rice. So I thought I could get a healthy meal, but I was wrong...

I talked to the worker at the front for 5 min, and asked her if there is a healthy (no oily/greasy) style way of making the dish. Unfortunately, we established that there was no way to do this.  Why have the brown rice option if you can't order the dish itself in a healthy way?   

I ordered the Pei Wei style chicken, and I waited for the food to come. 15 min later I finally got it. Keep in mind there was no one behind in line, and one person ordering from the \"take out\" line. I watched  the whole process go down. The main chef put my plate down on the counter in the kitchen, and the \"salad chef\" was supposed to garnish it with a simple rosemary/parsley addition. That hand off took an extra 7 minutes.... It seemed to me that there was arguing,  and disorderly production behind the counter.

My other complaint would be that the dinner portion which not that large is kinda of pricey.  The plate looks huge when it comes out of the kitchen, but  the Plate comes with 75% rice, and 25% meat so don't be fooled.   Why would you want to eat that kind of protein/carb ratio?  

I cannot order the lunch plate because it would not come with enough meat."}
{"text":"I've been to other Pei Wei's in the valley and I've yet to see any as busy as this one. The food is consistently good; do expect about a 20 minute wait for food if you are dining in. They recently got the new Coke touch machines where you can make your own flavor combo! YUM! This place can get noisy; I wouldn't recommend bringing kids since this place is very hectic and can be overwhelming to small children. Take Out is stellar and most of the time food is ready when promised."}
{"text":"A lot of people working, but seemed no one was in charge.  Place only had 5 sets of customers, yet took forever to get our meals.  Staff used rags to wipe tables to hold our plates.  One employee kept wiping her nose with her finger over and over.  I wonder if she has a food handlers card."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant occasionally and the parking is usually terrible and its pretty busy. However today I went in around dinner time and when I arrived there was no one in line. There was one woman who had placed an order and was waiting for it. But there was also no one at the cash registers to take my order. I waited for several minutes before an employee came to the area but she was on the phone handling the to go orders.  There was also a man who was punching things into the register but never looked up nor made eye contact with me. So I waited. In the meantime, several people arrived to pick up their to go orders. The man began to wait on them but still no one to wait on me.  After there were about 4 people in the to go line, the manager came out and asked the next person in the to go line \"who was next?\" The woman started placing her order but I interrupted and said, Excuse me, I was here before these 4 people were here. He looked over at me and then yet another employee came out of the kitchen and the manager said \"he'll wait on you\".  So I asked this employee if it is their policy to wait on the to-go customers before the customers who are dining in and he said no but talk to his manager. The manager was busy taking order and I didn't want to wait any longer than I already had, which was about 15 minutes. Sorry Pei Wei, your food is good but with your lack of customer service, I will be taking my business elsewhere.  There are plenty of other places to choose from."}

Ordered the orange chicken that's been advertised on television and on TV looks fantastic. The order that I received today taste like fried chicken with an orange slice on top I had to call over the guy and ask for more sauce which took about 10 minutes. Won't be back for that one again"}
{"text":"Yum!! Okay, no, this isn't authentic Chinese food and it's about as American as you get! I don't care, though! It's just what the doctor ordered sometimes! Location is convent and easy to find. Employees are very friendly and helpful. Bathrooms were clean. The food is delicious! Sesame chicken is my fav and my go to. I will definitely be back when I'm in ballentyne!"}
{"text":"Great menu offering at a good value. Nice atmosphere and easy to get in and out for a quick meal. When the complex is busy, parking at times could present a challenge."}
{"text":"Love the food but it's great at all locations. The customer service is horrible at this location. Only two tables were occupied at the time we walked in for a carry out. We walked in and they looked at us like.....really? Go away!! Someone walked up to the register and he just looked at me. I asked him if he was ready to take my order and he just kept looking at me like I was wasting his time.  No thank you, nothing. Just a hand to take my money and then a bag in my face so I would leave and get out of their faces. Really???"}
{"text":"Well.. I had never tried Pei Wei before, but the new commercials for the orange chicken got me wondering if it was any good. Going to have to say NO. I was extremely disappointed in my total experience with this Pei Wei location. On Friday, I was in the neighborhood, so I stopped in for a carry out order. The guy said it would be about 45 minutes, and is that okay. No it wasn't, so I left. I figured that the food must be really great for it to be so busy, and I'd come back the next day.. that was today. I brought up their webpage and its headline read \"Skip the wait and order online!\". Well that sounded great! It was about 3pm and I had errands, so I placed an order to be ready at 5pm. I got there about 4:45 and sat in my car and made a phone call til it was time to go in and pickup my food. I headed in at 4:57 annnnnd, no one was working the take out counter. No one acknowledged my presence or said \"We'll be right with you!\". But eventually someone came over and took my money and then said it would be about 15 minutes. What? Why? But whatever... I wasn't happy. I get home with the food, still hoping for an excellent meal. I purchased the orange chicken rice bowl and a chicken teriyaki rice bowl. Now, what I expected was chicken coated in a nice orange sauce with some sauce on the side... and chicken coated in a nice teriyaki glaze with extra sauce on the side. Well.. what I got was two orders of chicken on beds of rice with no sauces or glazes.. Huh? Oh but there was two plastic containers of liquid that resembled neither sauce nor glaze. Both looked like brown water. Sauces and glazes are supposed to be thick enough to stick to and coat the chicken. When I poured the \"orange?\" water over the chicken and rice, it just drained straight through. I tried to eat it, and it just wasn't good. The rice was terrible. I'm not sure if it was undercooked, or overcooked or what.. but it was not good rice at all. Not at all sticky, and wasn't pleasant to eat. I didn't bother with the \"teriyaki?\" water.. I ended up making a cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here one time and it was good, but definitely not my favorite. I ordered to go and had to wait a long time once I got there for my food. Classics are good, but be careful when trying new things."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious I ordered the kung pao shrimp roll and crab wonton on the side! Satisfied my Japanese craving.  The food is kind of a mix between Chinese and Japanese.  
Oh yes the manager is very polite too. Well im definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"Ordering online is the best way to go. You can even pay there so you can just pick up the food at the restaurant and leave. Plus you don't have to stand around and wait."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  60 minute wait for our lunch to be served.   Piles of dirty dishes on the tables, had to bus our own table.   Lots of hungry and irate customers.   Stay away!"}
{"text":"Interesting flavors and casual dining environment. Nothing that stood out to me in regards to a favorite dish. Good for an easy meal and good on the budget. Our dining experience was pleasant."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of Pei Wei but my most recent visit was disappointing. It seems like the quality has gone down and the prices have gone up. They are owned by PF Chang's but I don't think it's a similar taste. 

Kung Pao Chicken- You can order it without nuts or any other veggies you don't like. I usually order noodles instead of rice, with extra sauce. 

Crab Wontons- You can get an order of 2, 4, or 6. The sauce that comes with it is good but I also order sweet & sour to use as well. I used to really like these but they have a funny taste now. 

You can dine there or order take out. If you order take out and wait for it, it's usually pretty fast. 

Honestly, I'd rather pay the extra money to go to PF Changs or pay about the same to go to Panda Express. I never thought I would rather go to Panda over any other Chinese restaurant lol."}
{"text":"Yummy. They recently opened this location 2 days ago. Great original Pei Wei flavors. I ordered online and picked it up. I was in and out in 5 minutes. They did forget my potsticker sauce. The staff is a nightmare. But the food is amazing like all PeiWei locations. If you can avoid this location I would."}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty, dirty. Sticky floors,  rice on chairs and back seats, sticky filthy tables. I was afraid to go into the bathroom.  This place should be checked out by the Mesa health department.  Food was less than mediocre. This place should be shut down. As dirty as this place was, the staff was standing around doing nothing.   I had to ask one to clean a table since ALL of them were dirty."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and clean restaurant. Friendly and very accommodating staff. I'm a frequent visitor. This is a sister restaurant to PF Chang's, but without the formality or higher prices. Great place to eat if you want the same style foods as PF Chang's, but a more laid back environment without the need to dress up or spend more."}
{"text":"Normally not a fan, but this last time I had the Japanese Ramen with chicken and it was good.  And yes it is like PF Chang's except that when I leave I don't say \"I forget that I hate bad, overpriced, Chinese food\".  So go for it and steal a couple of extra fortune cookies while you're at it. Yup (Complementary fortune cookies always a good thing)."}
{"text":"The best fast-food style pan-asian cuisine in town. But the quality is really fresh. Everything is fried/cooked made to order so you do have to wait but dishes are piping hot!!

You order at the front and they give you a number that you take to your table. Most dishes for lunch average around $8.00

My favorite dish is the Mongolian dish (options of beef, chicken, shrimp or tofu). 

They have a new soda pop machine that is really HIGH-tech! The orange-citrus tea isn't so great. But they have fortune cookies in the middle of the condiments corner that aren't stale!!"}
{"text":"Greasy, fried and everything tastes the same. What else could you want? We ordered a variety of chicken and shrimp dishes and they all tasted exactly the same. All drenched in oil. Get some fresh vegetable options or something. This is a joke of Chinese food."}
{"text":"Food is usually good, but the service is consistently terrible. I waited 14 minutes on hold a few months back and tried again a couple weeks later and hung up after 10 minutes of waiting for someone to answer. Placing an order from a mobile device is no easy task and \"customizable options\" are limited. You can add or remove some things but there's no option to substitute (i.e. No scallions, add onion). We decided to try ordering again last night and once again, we waited on hold FOREVER. Hung up after 7 min 34 seconds and ordered online from my laptop (because creating an account from my phone was such an annoying inconvenience). Husband picked up order which was not ready on time and the food was just ok. Definitely not worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pei Wei probably 10+ times just because it was convenient.  The food is very average to me and I haven't been in a long time just because I was over it.  I started going to the new Poke bowl places that have been popping up everywhere, instead of Pei Wei.

Well today, I decided to go there for lunch and tried their new Poke bowl ... and all I can say is OMG!  It was so delicious & such a large portion.  I was soooo full, but couldn't stop eating... complete food coma.  My coworkers who went with me said I looked like a savage eating it... lol.  It's actually a spicy poke bowl, but I'm not too keen on hot food, so I had the spicy mixture removed.  The bowl consisted of rice, fresh ginger, avocado, tuna, crab, & California roll & some other veggies I can't exactly remember.  It was actually better than the poke bowl place.  

All I can say is that it was a home run and I'm actually excited to go back.  The downside is my mercury levels will be rising... lol"}
{"text":"Please fix your on line ordering system. Spent 10 min filling up the order then drove 20 min to get there and my order was not in the system. Turns out that when I placed the order there was a little window at the top stating that the time I picked was too early. Not even the girl at restaurant could see what was wrong. I then tried a new time and again same message. Apparently I need to somehow guess what will be an appropriate time for pick up for the order to go through. Wouldn't it be easier for the system to tell me when to pick up? So ended up putting the order personally at the restaurant and waiting 20 more minutes for the order. DO NOT USE the on line ordering!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I am amazed by the quick, quality and quantity of Food here. I have Had the Pad Thai twice and each time I love it Even more. My husband says this Is his New favorite Chinese food spot And I couldnt agree anymore. We sat at the bar And watched the cooks demonstate a complete live cooking show For us. Very fun."}
{"text":"The food is consistent and good. However, be aware that apparently volume spikes will slow down service significantly. Placed my online order at 11:30 for pickup at 12:15 PM, and prepaid. Quoted an additional 10 minute wait on arrival because they are experiencing heavy volume."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Pei Wei.    I don't want to complain because my experience here at Guadalupe location wasn't terrible.

The waiter brought me a bowl with 6 chicken wings explaining they cooked those rather the normal chicken in my dish.   So, after telling me it was my \"lucky day\", they gave me the wings for free as we continued to wait a bit longer for our food.   Oddly, when I got my dish, it had brown rice rather than white which is what I ordered, but I wanted to eat with my guests so I let it slide.    Everything tasted good as usual."}
{"text":"As always no disappointments. The food is amazing and very tasty and fresh. My family loves this place , it's our favorite"}

How can you have 1 person bagging meals at the height of the day, who is seemingly the only one to answer questions for the (based on the frequency of questions) inexperienced and overwhelmed cashiers/order takers.  Someone needs to take a look at the gross inefficiencies of what has become a complete nightmare.

From now on I'll drive the extra 10 miles to get my food from a place with some concept of service."}
{"text":"The Honey Tofu was really tasty. I didn't love the tofu preparation (thin sliced and pan fried) but the sauce was delicious. Complex, well balanced flavors. The Thai wonton soup was nice as well. Regular wonton soup with fresh basil added. Overall was a nice easy lunch stop."}
{"text":"I find that this chain Asian fusion restaurant has gone downhill recently. Perhaps it is only the Avondale location? My go to dish here is the honey seared tofu with brown rice. The last couple of times I have had it however, I found the tofu to be extremely chewy and there was way too much sauce on my meal. As far as prices go, they are reasonable and the portions are generous. Although I'm not in a hurry to return to this restaurant, I would consider giving it another try in the distant future."}
{"text":"This was my very first time to a Pei Wei, I was excited to try them out. The wonderful and strong smells that wrap around your nose as soon as you step in to the place, cause some form of excitement in your stomach for the food that awaits. But, in all honesty Pei Wei left me wanting more, more flavors, more spices, and better textures. It was not as good as I had expected it to be, and I had high hopes for it, since my former co-worker had been raving on how good the food was from this place. I will tell you that the lettuce wraps were good, and I think the best thing I had from them that day, I also had some of the spicy orange chicken and that lacked flavor and chicken, It felt like I was eating a ball of dough, covered with sauce and with the minimal amount of chicken on it, and the pork egg roll, was not that tasty neither was the fried rice. I know others may love it, but It was simply not for me! 
Thanks anyways, it's not you Pei, It's me!! :)"}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service here!!
This place is always clean, friendly and quick!! 
Maritza at the register is great, such a great personality and quick to assist!! Love it!"}
{"text":"I live right next to this location and it's terrible. I've been there 5 times and each time there was something wrong with the food or it was just gross tasting (not fresh at all). Equally, there seems to regularly be super long lines and crazy 20-30 minute wait times after your order for food to cook. Go somewhere else... almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm loving the gluten free options!! I've had the GF spicy chicken twice in 10 days. Its so hard to find GF Chinese food. This totally hits the spot! Spicy, crispy, amazing! Thank you for being GLUTEN SENSITIVE!"}
{"text":"I rarely yelp but when I have its only positive. I need to post because this place at this particular location is bad on all levels. Calling in to order take out is impossible. The first time I tried weeks ago and I waited on my phone for 15 minutes only to give up. I just tried today and the same. If they are not answering the phones they shouldn't have a message thanking you for continuing to hold. This forces online ordering but their online ordering is so complex it takes forever to order a few simple items. My girls love their food but I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"Good service.  Good food selection.  Was a slow night.  We ordered the Thai soup as part of our order, paid for it and waited.  They then finally realized they had run out of the soup."}
{"text":"yummy food we ordered as we rolled back into town from SD. It was hot, delicious and just as we expected. Got the lettuce wraps, the crab won tons, spicy Mandarin Kong pow, chicken pad tai and honey chicken for the kiddo's..."}
{"text":"One of the best hangover foods you can get.  Always had good food from this place.  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Worse service ever during lunch hour.  Food server can't keep up.  No one cleaning up tables from previous guest. Line out the door.  One cashier and the other jumping for to go orders. Crazy busy.  Hire more help!"}
{"text":"This location is quite close to my job so I like to frequent.when I first started I liked it because when I called they would know me by my name and just repeat back to me my usual order I would always be sure to specify no red bell peppers. Thankfully there were never any red bell peppers. Over the past four times they have continuously messed up my order after the second time I decided to call the manager and speak with them about the issue. I could barely understand what he was saying and after he listened to my spiel, instead of apologizing he went directly to refunding me the money which I never actually saw it refunded back onto my card. Now I'm not a spiteful person and I do love pei wei however when I went back a third time they forgot to include both sauces for both the entrée and mail so I use soy sauce as a salad dressing. Distraught but not giving up their last chance over the phone I explained it to them my past experiences and explained to them exactly what I was looking for when I got there I double checked the bag and there was no sauce and no chips I look to the girl and I said there are no sauce and there are no chips then she gave me attitude and said they're in their so I double checked, and I said oh really because I definitely know they're not in there she looked into the bag and once she realized she was wrong threw them into the bag. I have yet to be back but don't plan on any trips any time soon I gave them more than enough chances they don't deserve my money or time. A monkey can follow simple instructions... why can't they?"}
{"text":"good food, prices are fair, extremely clean and well managed, many great choices on the menu"}
{"text":"Really under impressed.  Just a touch above Panda Express.  One in my group had pad thai, which was was not good.  My meal was fine, but not that impressive.  I may give Pei Wei another chance, but not very likely.  Parking was ok in a very busy location.  Staff was friendly.  Coke freestyle machine was cool."}
{"text":"First of all, the service sucked. The lady who greeted us at the cash register was rude and short. We would ask questions about some menu items and she would look at us and talk to us like we weren't thinking and being dumb. We finally order then get our food, my fried rice was cold and had a weird, unusual flavor the orange chicken I order absolutely had no flavor or spice... after a few bites of each we eventually gave up, pushed our plates away and walked out very unhappy with our service and food."}
{"text":"If it were not for meeting a friend in a very serious conversation I would have returned our dishes. She ordered a shrimp dish where she said tasted awful but was too hungry and in tears to complain. I ordered the Mongolian beef. Aside from the sauce being too salty the beef... well let's say I could have got a bag of jerky from 7/11 that would have tasted better. The vegetables were under-cooked and it appeared was thrown in well after the beef was over-cooked. 

Had it not been for our situation I would have returned it and asked for a refund. They were not that busy, there was no excuse for such a dish to leave the kitchen. 

Another note... the amount of food for the price, even if it was good takes this place off my go to list."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here after finding out they had gluten free options on their menu. This was particularly exciting for my fiancé who suffers from celiac's disease. We came in and the place looked pretty cool. The staff seemed friendly and it was a pretty nice environment. I ordered a Teriyaki meal and she ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken from the gluten free menu. We took our food to-go. When we got home (we live less than ten minutes away) we were excited to try it out, but we both ended up disappointed with our meals. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with the meals, they just tasted very bland. I didn't really get a lot of flavor from the chicken or the rice. It kind of tasted like a microwaved teriyaki bowl. My fiancé also said something similar about her dish. For the price, it definitely wasn't worth it in my opinion. Kind of a let down. Overall, awesome joint with nice people. The food, however, is kind of a let down."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service in the valley. Their website was not working for online orders so I called and was placed on hold for 10 mins before anyone answered. When someone finally did they took my order 3 times and then hung up on me. When I went to pick up my food I asked for hot mustard and was repeatedly told it was in the bag which it wasn't. Finally I asked another employee who rolled her eyes at me and finally gave me the mustard. I love pei wei but I will never visit this location again!"}
{"text":"We had been excited for this to open up so near our house. The first few times we ate here the food was pretty good. However in our last few trips, service and food were terrible. Food comes out sporadically. On our most recent visit, entrees came out before our soups and egg rolls. We had to keep asking about the soup and egg rolls and were met with eye rolling and attitude. Won't be back unless something PF Changes."}
{"text":"I really love this \"PF Changs Jr.\" and come here often. I order online using coupons they send to me via email. Last week they sent me a BOGO for the entrees and this week a 20% off my total order. When I walk in to pick up my food they always remember me and take the time to ask how I am and go over the order to make sure it is right. 

I order the pei wei spicy steak each time but change up having either rice or noodles under it depending on my mood and have them leave the veggies out. Just spicy steak and rice or noodles do it for me on that dish. The veggie spring rolls are damn good. It comes with a sauce for dipping that is very good but my wife likes to dip hers in their sweet and sour, so we pay .50 cents extra for that but it comes in a reusable/washable plastic container. The side of brown rice I ordered this time was not cooked right and still crunchy. It was intended to be mixed in my dogs food as a \"healthy\" treat for her but the spoiled girl ended up with some of the white rice instead. My wife had honey seared chicken and enjoyed it... I had a few peices and did too. I am always satisfied after eating here."}
{"text":"For meat eaters: 4 stars
For vegetarians : 0 stars

Okay. I used to love pei wei, when I was a meat eater. The one problem is that their sauces are incredibly salty (not just high in sodium but ridiculously salty tasting). However they are very accomodating with special requests so I forgive them on that part. I also loved their chopped chicken salad, and highly recommend that to meat eaters. When you order to go, they actually have someone double check to make sure that what youre getting in the bag is what you actually ordered. 99% of the time, this accuracy check works. So if you eat meat, I highly recommend Pei Wei. And I recommend their To Go service. It is fast and efficient. You can order online as well, and there are plenty of special request options online.

However once I went vegetarian...options were not abound. Oh, yes, they have tofu, that's nice....I thought. So I ordered my meal with tofu instead of meat. The taste and texture of their tofu (yes Ive had tofu before and generally have a great relationship with it) SERIOUSLY nauseated me. I took the rest home thinking somebody else might make some use of it. They opened up the to-go box to look at what I had brought home and just LOOKING at that tofu I had eaten made me nauseous all over again. I had to lay down. I was sick the rest of the night, it was that disgusting.

Thinking of it now makes me queasy even. I would stick to brown rice and veggies if you are a vegetarian eating at pei wei."}
{"text":"This review is based upon consistency of flavor and great customer service.  We came and there was an unknown issue that required a 25 minute wait for food.  The employee notified us, and although hesitant, we decided to stay.  We have been here numerous times before in the past years so we are familiar with this location.  The employee was apologetic and gave us a free drink.  That was a simple gesture but rarely do you see decent customer service anymore.  We received our food and had an issue with an incorrect order.  It was explained and the issue was resolved quickly.  They gave us a free appetizer.  We do not expect perfection, nor free food.  This restaurant cares for customers and works to provide a positive experience.  We would return again because they have good food and they care.  That is a rarity in today's restaurant culture.  Kudos to the manager for creating this culture.  Ordered- fried rive and Tofu, edamame, won ton soup, dynamite chx, and Thai curry chx"}
{"text":"The food is always good but I feel like the service at this location  has gone downhill. I feel like they never have enough staff working. We arrived on a Sunday night around 5:15. The line was out the door for both take out and to dine in. Only two people working to take orders and handle carry out. By the time we got to front of line the girl said it will take 20 minutes to get our food. Tables had not been bussed and the drink/silverware station had not been replenished. I think they could do better in the service department. There have been other reviews in regards to this same issue."}
{"text":"Knew what I wanted but I couldn't order an entree had to be a bowl plus I was going to get a couple of sushi rolls. I couldn't believe what the prices had gone up to for a self service restaurant. It's good but you pay for what should be the price of a meal for 2. Just going to a sushi restaurant next time."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei and there often, but this location is terrible.  They have disappointed me many times.  The only reason I have given this location multiple chances is because it is the closest to my house.  Their food never tastes right compared to other locations, and the dining area is always dirty.  On our last visit there they did not have any chopsticks \"until tomorrow\" (what?) and they served my food on a filthy looking plate.   I will not be returning, and I doubt anyone there even cares.  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei.  Always busy though.  Pei Wei spicy chicken with white rice. . .delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it zero stars. This was the absolute worst Chinese food I have ever had. Lo mein was drowning in sugar. Egg rolls were awful too. Food was so bad I couldn't eat it and ended up tossing it and buying a sandwich to take on the plane."}
{"text":"I used to go to Pei Wei 3-5 times a week between lunch and dinner at this location. Lately this location has had a host of issues - they don't answer their phone (case in point I've been on hold for 20+ minutes and on infinite hold loop. When we've asked why they don't answer their phones they say their phones aren't working.  My wife actually drove down to the location while she's still on hold to order! Not sure what's happened with management of this location, dining area always looks disheveled and dirty, the quality of the orders has gone down and the customer service has slipped tremendously. We gave it one last try tonight but it seems I will be spending my once loyal $$ somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on with the management of this location, but it seems to be going downhill quickly.

We stopped in last night for what should have been a quick bite on our way to the theater. However, what would have been a quick bite turned into a long time waiting for our food. And it wasn't just us, everyone around us was commenting on how long it was taking for food to come out of the kitchen. Now, since it's open, I could that there were plenty of people back there so I'm not sure why it took so long, but it certainly did.

Now, if you're going to compete in the fast, casual, restaurant market, you need to nail the fast part. When this Pei Wei was new, maybe they could get away with it, seeing as the only nearby competition was the (now gone) My Florist Cafe, but now that there is a Habit Burger, Chipotle, Pot Belly Sandwiches, and On a Roll within walking distance the management of Pei Wei need to get their act together. 

Also, the last time we were at this location, they completely screwed up our order and brought us the wrong dishes.

Get it together Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"Gosh, I'm embarrassed to say I eat here. But Pei Wei, is a predictable, safe and tame alternative to figuring which Chinese take out places haven't violated any Maricopa County Health Dept. codes.  Amen on the more preferable wait vs. its monstrous cousin PF.  Personally, I dig the orange peel chicken and minced chicken lettuce wraps similar to the big cousin, but much prefer the more laid-back environs here.  Go Pei Wei."}
{"text":"This place is a horrible employer.  They didn't pay an employee for over a month.  Terrible management.  Something very wrong going on with this store.   I like the food but I will never go to this store nor recommend it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several Pei Wei restaurants and often get the chicken lettuce wraps. The wraps I received at This location were very disappointing. The lettuce was wilted, limp and brown In parts.  The chicken mixture had more water chestnuts than chicken pieces.  I left it at the table."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is the originator and everyone else is an imitator! They're on point. Every time, without fail. I always know what to expect. Fast service, great food and a fair price. My only complaint is the seating. The tables are a little close and it is hard to have a conversation without the table on either side of you being a part of it. 

Order anything on the menu. It will be a home run!"}
{"text":"I understand your business will be backed up and busier than normal due to specials you have going on. However, a great manager would be prepared & staff their restaurant accordingly.  My online order said it would be ready in 13 minutes, show up 10 minutes later than order was to be ready. Walked in door and not one of the three workers greeted or asked if I had been helped. After a few minutes of standing there & when an employee was done bagging lettuce she went to the counter to help me, the gentleman behind her looked up my order. Said mine was coming up next, 30 min later still no call of my name. I went to the counter to ask if my order was ready. She looked thru bags & found my order sitting on the counter for who knows how long. They were NOT calling out names! Took a quick glance in the bag to count containers & walked out. drove home & opened up food to feed my children & their food was not there...I have been sitting on the phone on hold for the last 29 minutes. Will my order be fixed today? most likely not because they aren't answering their phones probably because it's an unorganized madhouse there! If a manager could contact me to fix this problem that would be great.  I will NOT be going back this evening to waste more of my time."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Pei Wei, but I've realized that there are only a couple of dishes that are always on par so I end up only getting those. The Mongolian Chicken extra well done with no scallions, add broccoli is my favorite & the Dan Dan Noodles dish is good as well. I've also tried the Kung Pao chicken which sometimes comes out salty as does the Sesame Chicken.

I'm really glad that they have two different sizes .. I personally find that the small is sufficient, especially for lunch. It's nice to eat here every once in a while. Also, keep in mind that this location is always busy, especially at peak lunch time. The line often times is out the door & it takes some time to get a table. The staff up front does a pretty good job keeping things moving."}
{"text":"Yep. Last time at Pei Wei. I used to be able to order online.  Now it doesn't let me order via cash. Came in tonight and the normal ordering line was long. I went to the pick up line like I always have to order and manager took my order but said I need to go through the other line next time. Forget it."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time... Kinda like a Mongolian grill set up.. Didn't really expect that. I thought it was a nicer sit down restaurant. 

When you enter there is a huge lit up menu to the right that tells you how to order.
 Then you go up to the register and tell them your order. 
1. Pick your protein
2. Pick your sauce or if you want noodles
3. I dont remember... Was it extras?

I ordered beef with brown rice half size in the Mongolian sauce. The half size was a pretty good amount of rice but not really a lot of meat. The meat I did have was yummy tho. I also ordered 4 piece spicy tuna roll.. Not very good: hard rice and def not spicy.

Service was great! 

Probably would come back here and try the other sauces.  Not too bad!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Pei Wei since the one here in FH closed down a couple years ago. Had the Orange Peel chicken, & lettuce wrap. Both were very good!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian options are pretty good, especially if you like tofu. The restaurant was out of napkins the last time I was there and the staff was friendly. I would recommend the take-out option versus dining in though."}
{"text":"This location has always been good but recently they seem to have amped it up a little . I didn't remember fried rice as an option . The portions are generous and very fresh . Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"I have come to this Pei Wei since it opened but have had the most horrendous experience to the point I had to write. First off I've tried to order through a delivery service twice and both times they say the restaurant is closed. So I decided to call the restaurant today at 5:30pm to see and was on hold for more than 30 minutes. In fact I walked in the restaurant doors while still on hold and told the gentleman at the to go area all of this. He said ok I'm too busy to pick up the phone. Not even half the restaurant is full by the way. So I order. It took more than 30 minutes for something that normally takes them 5! At this point after trying to order through Postmates and being told the restaurant was closed(because they didn't pick up the phone), to trying to call the restaurant itself, to the wait I wanted to speak with the manager. She was too busy to come talk to me so I went to her. Not only did she attempt to make me look like a fool for complaining(also whole entire restaurant out of every single beer), but said well let me cook for people and not deal with you. Now I'm a very good customer and never have issues anywhere. This was just beyond ridiculous. She also informed me they had over 40 minute ticket times for people eating in. There were only 5 tables of people. Whoever is running this place lately has seriously made a big mistake. I'm embarrassed for this place, was treated rudely, and now going to make sure everyone knows just how the general manager responds to individuals. You do not respond that way that is for sure!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here because I was picking up dinner for the better half next door.  I asked how long the wait is for a to go order.  They said 10 minutes placed my order and went next door to get the better half's dinner.  I came back a few minutes a later and the food was ready.

 The order was correct too.  

I get home and start to eat it and the chicken just did not taste right.  I tired a couple of smaller pieces.  I ended up taking all of the chicken out of the lo mein and eating the veggies and noodles.  The chicken tasted like maybe it was cooked sitting than reheated.  The spring rolls were good too.  The lo mein minus the chicken was good.  Just not sure what to expect with this place anymore.

Looking at the latest reviews.  I think it is time to move on now."}
{"text":"I've been to Pei Wei a number of times and usually the food and flavor is excellent. Today however I ordered the seseme chicken with quinoa.  I've had this item before but it was way different this time. It was very greasy and tasted very unhealthy.  I'm not sure what product change was made but it is definitely a negative.  Food was gross."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick small bite. Didn't disappoint.  Being a test kitchen, they I was told have items other Pei Wei locations don't have yet. Just tried the spicy cucumber salad, slaw and a cup of wonton soup and it was flavorful and just right proportions.  Recommend. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Called for a to go order. Waited for 10 mins on hold. Some guy finally took my order and said it will be 25 mins for my order to be ready. When I got there, they didn't have my order."}
{"text":"It's been over 9 years since my original review of this location so it's time for an update, and unfortunately it's not a good one. I still really like Pei Wei food, at least the food they used to serve, but I'm not sure what is going on lately. First of all they've changed the menu and not in a positive way. They've now added sushi and just like nearly every other fast-casual restaurant in town they've gone to this thing were you order a bowl of rice or some other base and then add your protein. I suppose that's great if you're going to Kyoto Bowl or something, but Pei Wei had its own niche and now it seems to have abandoned that.

Secondly, they no longer serve pot stickers. Really? Was it too much trouble to make pot stickers and serve them? They'd already changed the style and made them less tasty, but dropping them altogether is ridiculous!

Also, the food doesn't taste as good. My go-to is either the Kung Pao Chicken or the Mongolian Beef and the last few times I've had they just taste rubbery as if they have not been fully cooked. In fact, I was afraid I was going to get food poisoning they were so undercooked.

Finally, they were out of fortune cookies the last time I visited. How does a Chinese, sorry Asian-fusion, restaurant run out of fortune cookies????

I get that they are no longer owned by P.F. Chang's, but it just seems like the new ownership is taking this chain downhill fast. I used to crave Pei Wei but now it's just meh and not worth going out of my way to get.

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Not bad for fast paced food when I'm In a rush.  Service has really improved and consistency on food. 

I usually get the polynesian bowl and customize it completely and they are always happy to do it which is great,  since I can't always eat too much spicy things. 

Also if you do the feedback they print on the receipt you get a free cookie... yum!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  Service is totally fine."}
{"text":"Tasty but expensive.

My personal favorite is the Kung Po Beef with fried rice.  I always throw an order of carb wontons in for good measure."}
{"text":"Come here a lot and the last two times it has not been good. The California Roll came out with brown mango and cucumber peels not pieces of cucumber. The wonton soup was barely warm and the vegetables weren't even cut up. The manager wanted to argue that it's always like that. Not the last ten times I've ordered. He also told us that it's because of the inexperienced employees. If this is the case why was he not helping then to fix the problems. The portion sizes have gotten smaller and the price are higher. Sadly I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am done with Pei Wei. They have botched 3 different orders. Everytime I contact customer service and they promise to fix the problem. But the mistakes continued to occur. 

I wont make the mistake of ordering from Pei Wei again. There are plenty of better options in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Not what I expected.  Food was good, but nothing special.  Portions seemed small.  I really did not expect the stand in line to place your order, go find a seat and wait for someone to bring your food, and then you never get spoken to again. Reminds me of McDonalds.  We got Thai Dynamite, which sounds spicy, but was bland, and sesame chicken, which was so so.
While we were there, we saw someone spill a large amount of salt or sugar on the floor right by a door.  Saw a server going out the door about fall, and then 4 employees walk by it before it got cleaned up around 5-10 minutes later.  Lawsuit waiting to happen.
Don't think we'll go back :("}
{"text":"Either comparing to other PW's or to other Asian diners, this one is A-OK.  Their food to me is on the salty or too spicy side.  We usually come here when the husband has a hankering for \"Chinese food\" but doesn't want \"authentic\" Chinese food.  I can deal.

The parking kind of sucks here though so try to avoid coming during peak hours.  I've had pretty consistent decent service though whether it be dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the Teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice and no veggies. So much so that it is all I ever order there. However, my girl has tried every other dish there and been very please with 99% of them. They have good tasting water, nice napkins and tasty fortune cookies. Good service most of the time and very reasonable prices.

My only complain would be that on their website they showed the Teriyaki bowl to be only 500 calories but they actually split the bowl up into 2 servings which makes it 1000 calories so you must read the fine print before calculating your caloric intake.

I can't wait to go back and get another t-bowl!"}
{"text":"Couldn't be more annoyed.   Per Wei is one of my go to/good value regular spots.  Honestly, the flavor of the food was fine.  However,  only one register  open at 7:30 pm on a Friday.  We came in and were 2nd in line.  I kid you not, we waited 15 minutes to give our order.  Not sure if it was inexperienced customers ordering immediately in front of us, or an inexperienced cashier or both, but they should have done something to expedite the process and they didn't.  The line was plenty long by the time we ordered.  Then, I ordered my usual, the regular sized kung pao chicken.  I'm not sure if it's an initiative the company just started or a location error, but it was far and away the smallest regular size order I have ever received.  Exceptionally annoyed!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei at this location is inconsistent. One day the food is fine, another day bland, not cooked correctly, watered down  wonton soup, shrimp fried rice had clumps of white rice in it, and again, bland - not stir fried the way it should be. I've been going to this location for over 10 years, I wish their food would be consultant, and., not based on whom is doing the cooking that night. Very frustrating. Getting a bit tired of this."}
{"text":"I'm new to town and haven't really explored this chain, but order the Thai Wonton Soup and your heart and soul will thank you."}
{"text":"This isn't a very clean or helpful location.  The millennial staff walks around like they being inconvenienced if you need something.  I asked for some soy sauce.  I got a two tablespoons worth of soy sauce in a greasy, incrusted bottle of Kikomann.  Thanks.  Can I have a wet wipe to go along with the germs you just handed me?  This kid, who took our order, needs to be fired.  He's rude and shouldn't be in the HOSPITALITY industry. I wish I had gotten his name.  Brown hair and eyes.  About 5'9\".  Slight build.  Have a talk with him with his last \"Pei check\" in hand. 

Really, Alexis, I don't see why I have to complete a service review through a website when you probably already know the person that mad our visit unpleasant.  We visited around 730 to 8 pm on Thursday, 1/18/2018.  We ordered the lettuce wraps, Japanese shrimp and beef bowl, and a general Taos chicken.  

You're versed with aloha?  That's your operating system?  Look it up through BOH aloha functions.  Hilarious I have to tell you this as a manager.  Good luck with your staff!"}
{"text":"We came at a great time & beat the lunch crowd.  I ordered spicy orange chicken with brown rice. The small is just the right amount to leave feeling full and satisfied. I always order a side of mango crab rolls. I'm not a fan of seafood and these don't taste fishy or seafoodish at all. Bonus! We will be back. Plus... the choose your own drink machine is always a plus."}
{"text":"A friend turned me on to this place like this:\"do you like pf chang's? then go here. Same food,but cheaper,atmosphere not as nice, owned by the same poeple.\"
I havn't been back to pf chang's since! WE LOVE PEI WEI
I usually order mongolian beef wih brown rice...hubby changes it up, kiddo usually gets chow mein with chicken.
 I just love both teas they have in house...an unsweetened mandarin green tea, and a chai (vanilla?) black tea. and all the fortune cookies one could want,lol
crab rangoon pretty good, love the lettuce rolls forever. join their mailing list, they do specials every now and then!"}
{"text":"This place does a great job!

Last night, I really needed some sort of recovery food, and \"Asian\" was on my mind.

Yes, this place is a chain, but who cares. If it's good, why not go. I'm Elite, not a pretentious moron. 

I placed my order to go from their Web site. The site is pretty easy to navigate and each item has a corresponding picture. The best part, was you could customize each dish without having to call and tell them. For example, I wanted each of my dishes, \"spicy\". This is the way on-line ordering should be.

Then, I drove up to the location, and noticed there was a separate entrance for Pick Up orders. FANTASTIC! 

By the time I got to the counter, my food was ready, and packed neatly so that none of the sauces would spill. When I asked for chili and soy sauces, I got TONS. Also have a bunch of chopsticks now. Great job here. A+

The food itself was fantastic. It wasn't like home-made, but then again, I wasn't looking for home-made. We split the Thai Dynamite Chicken (large chunks of chicken, delicious basil, no vegetables sadly), and the Chicken Japanese Chile Ramen (very spicy, delicious and perfect). 

Each dish is portioned for one person, so if you want \"a la carte\" or \"family\" style, tell them ahead of time so they can separate the rice or noodles for you.

I can't wait to come back and dine in. The restaurant was a cafe and \"Fast Casual\" style. Clean, simple menu.

Stan W. hit the nail on the head. \"Chain Schmain!\" A good place to eat, is a good place to eat, regardless of how many locations they have."}
{"text":"I typically love Pei . This is the second time I've tried to order from this location and they have forgotten half of our order. Beware of your order."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pei Wei location because the food and service is always exceptional.  We are regulars here.  They have a decent amount of gluten free options which is so nice. Everyone so helpful here and answers any questions we ever have about the menu. The food is always great and the service is always exceptional so I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service.

I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, \"chicken fried rice, right?\" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.

Or at least their version of it.

I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.

Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.

The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink, which cost $1.85. The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents."}
{"text":"Not enough big tables, even if you just have a party of 3. Tables are too heavy to drag and it's a little awkward."}
{"text":"First time in today with the family! Food was great and the service was amazing. When the lady who brought out our food saw that my son didn't like his food she asked if we would like to try a small bowl of rice instead. So kind of her, will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I didn't think I could be so turned off from a place I was so looking forward to.  Let me first say I'm a fan of Pei Wei but not this location.  The newness of this location has me expecting some serious wait times and I am okay with that.  What I am NOT okay with is the girl taking my order who is so wonderfully adorned with hickies the size of silver dollars all of her neck and also the attitude that I am bothering her by having her take my order AKA her JOB! Apparently there was a 45 minute \"to go\" wait that she decided to not tell me about when ordering (the restaurant itself was relatively empty so I would not have come upon this conclusion otherwise).  When I asked after 20 minutes of waiting where my food was, I was laughed at and told my someone who just got done blowing their nose and NOT washing their hands that it would be another 20-25 minutes. Appalled and disgusted.  This location and Pei Wei in general might lose my years of business because of poor management.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! I highly recommend  the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Like this more upscale Panda Express.   They have a made to order menu of which I had the ginger broccoli with chicken.  It tasted good but I am not sure about the health benefits a plenty of soy sauce.  Plenty of soda choices and nice ice teas.  They bring the food to you."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Lots of variety. It's not a true Chinese food more like an American Chinese food. This place is like the higher end of Panda Express."}
{"text":"My rate is just based on service. Food is great, but with more than half of the tables empty we needed to wait over 20mins for the food, one of my kids order was the wrong one and on top of the waiter handed us the plates instead of serving them on the table.
Service is the key when spending my money.
Fast food chains can be great, ask Chick-fil-A"}
{"text":"I love the Honey Seared chicken with rice.  Everything else on the menu just isn't that exciting to me. I wouldn't really choose to go here except it's close to my house and easy.  Prices are good for me cause I can eat half for dinner and then the other half for lunch the next day.  Sometimes getting the food takes a while cause they're always busy.  I don't really like eating there either cause it's really loud and echoy."}
{"text":"This is a cheaper alternative to PF Changs. And by cheaper I mean the wait staff and quality of food is reflected. Manager tries to make rounds and make it all right with patrons but counter girls who take your order could use a class in communications and manners."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner last night and I was shocked when we walked in the door.  It was not a typical PeiWei experience.  There seemed to be no one running the store!  The floors were filthy with papers/wrappers all over the flooors, food everywhere, on the floors on the tables.  I couldn't even find anyone to wipe off a table so we had to do that ourselves.  PF Changs you should be embarrassed to have this location.  It clearly requires new management or any management for that matter. I would not go back!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Pei Wei for years. The menu is not traditional Chinese; they have their own unique dishes and preparation, which seems to bother some other reviewers, but we enjoy the food for what it is. 

We generally stick with the original menu items from years back, like the Mongolian beef and Spicy shrimp. We have not tried the new smaller dinners and wraps. Over the past year or so, the portion sizes have gotten noticeably smaller, but the quality of the food has remained consistently good. The only exception is the Kung Pao beef. This used to be prepared with a fairly heavy coating of potato starch, giving the beef a stiff consistency I really liked. Lately, however it is mostly just flaccid meat with lots of sauce. I wish they would bring the old recipe back. 

We occasionally order take out online. The web site is easy to use, and they never mess up an order. The food is always ready on time.
 
The restaurant is clean and family friendly, and the staff is efficient and courteous. It continues to be a family favorite.  (Please fix the Kung Pao beef...)"}
{"text":"Ridiculous!  I ordered on-line so my wife could pick it up on the way home.  Charged me $32.31 and when she got there....they say they didn't get my order?!?!?  No manager on duty for my wife to talk to and they employee she was talking to was absolutely no help and was laughing.  How can you take someone's money and not get the order?  Call the police, a ROBBERY just happened."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this joint for a while now. I just tried the Thai coconut curry once with noodles and chicken and it was spicy, i like spicy. Didn't like the noodles or chicken. The second time with rice and steak. Way better just not spicy enough. Love the honey seared chicken."}
{"text":"Like this upscale Panda  Express. Better choices and cooked to order.  The orange peel is always tasty and my usual  choice but today I tried the broccoli ginger which was good but a bit salty and drenched with soy type sauce"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Customers standing around forever waiting for food. We have been waiting for 45 mins. They are smart to have you pay upfront as we would have got up and left a long time ago!"}
{"text":"My wife and I hadn't eaten here in quite some time, but we were both kinda craving it. The last time we went in there we both got sick and this time was no different. Without being too graphic, it felt like our insides were being ripped out after eating our dinner last night and the leftovers for lunch today.

I had the Mongolian Beef Noodle Bowl and my wife had the Honey Seared Chicken Noodle Bowl. My wife's dish was extremely dry and the noodles, you could have knocked someone out with as dry as they were and it seemed like they forgot the CHICKEN part of the bowl. The Mongolian Beef was very salty and the meat was tough and not easy to chew. We also had the Lettuce Wraps and the pieces of lettuce we got were salad quality, meaning shredded up instead of being like the normal ones. We had to tear down the lettuce even smaller than it already was to even try and put the wrap filling in it. Overall this was a huge waste of money and time.

Needless to say we will NEVER be going back there again. This has now happened the last 2 times that we have been there in the last 6 months. I don't know if it has to do with how they clean their woks, or lack thereof, but something has to change. Also, as someone else previously stated, the customer service was definitely lacking and the 2 girls at the pickup counter were too busy talking to each other to pay attention to their customers. Management, I hope you are reading this because you're going to lose your franchise if your employees keep up these shenanigans and nonsense."}
{"text":"Called and say on hold for 15 minutes to not even be able to place an order. Went in and placed it to go instead and waited 30 minutes to receive cold Edamame and 4 pieces of chicken with my rice (picture attached but I added sauce the rice was dry) don't go here not worth the headache and the time to get a refund"}
{"text":"We have come to this Pei Wei many times. Tonight was the first time we did not have an excellent experience. The guy who took our order was kind of rude. Read our order back to us while we were still discussing our options. 
Our edamame came and was cold. If it wasn't for our food runner HECTOR, we might not come back here. He was awesome and remedied the problem. 
When my wife's dish came it was wrong. The replacement was over cooked. 
Hopefully our next visit will be better if there is one. 
Hector is the man."}
{"text":"Especially slow and offered everyone else appetizers but us while we waited 30 mins for food. Not sure this location is being managed the best."}
{"text":"Always good, fresh Chinese that is more on the American Chinese side but still good. I like the Kung Pao Chicken and Lettuce Wraps the best. If you have been to PF Chengs just imagine it as the fast casual version. I gave them 4 potstickers...."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places for lunch but it has gone considerably down hill since the chain was bought out by a non local investment firm.  Service is lackluster at best and thy do not provide a level of service the business use to maintain.  Staff act as if they are doing you a favor by being served and are not the least bit friendly.  On several occasions, I have been cut off by a staff member who was in a hurry to get somewhere.  If you order a combo plate, the bring your entree out with the soup so your entree will be cold by the time you finish the app.  Overall, the food quality is about the same.  They need to improve their service if they don't wish to lose diners."}
{"text":"So this place technically closes at 9:30 but if you try calling in after 9:00 good luck getting helped.  Tonight I called in at 9:02 and someone finally picked up at 9:17.  I was obviously upset and the person said that this happens a lot (which I know because it's happened to me before as well) and I asked to talk to the manager to see what was going on.  Ernesto was the manager and he clearly could have given two shits about the fact that I was on hold for 15 minutes.  I talked to him for a few minutes and realized I was basically talking to a wall in terms of his level of care about the situation - he never once attempted to compensate me for the situation, offer a solution, mention what they could do to make it better in the future, ask what they could do to make it right with me, or anything.  He also refused to take any responsibility for the situation.  It in essence boiled down to a response of \"oh, ok, yeah that's how it is\".  Poor management and customer service for sure there, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a fan of Pei Wei.  The food is very safe and MOR.  It's the \"go to\" place for your white christian co-workers who don't normally like asian food.  Not that I've ever had anything bad there, just . . . it's the Applebee's of asian restaurants . . . it feels wrong ordering asian food from white kids

I will give them this . . . I don't normally care for chinese egg rolls (how can you when vietnamese egg rolls with fish sauce are a billion times better), but theirs are probably the best I've had"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pei Wei. It is always clean and never too crowded. They also have a fantastic covered patio. I like the Mongolian beef or chicken and the Dan Dan noodles and my husband likes pretty much everything he tries here. They used to have a beef ramen bowl that was to die for but I guess it was only offered for a limited time. The food can be salty at times but I always enjoy it."}
{"text":"The worst PeeWee there is. Order here regularly for lunch at work, but no more.

I'd say conservatively 60% of our orders are screwed up or sub-par in someway. 

Where to start? Salads have had old, smelly fish, contained the parts of lettuce you would typically throw away, have some part of a label from an avocado or pepper mixed in, and some are missing dressing cups. 

Rice bowls have had overcooked rice, almost no meat, dry/old meat or were missing the actual edible parts of vegetables altogether. 

If you're really lucky, you'll end up with someone else's order or parts of their order mixed in and/or substituted for yours. And a few times, just completely missing parts of the order.

We have called almost every time this happens to bring this to the attention of the restaurant. Of course, they want you to come back to swap it out; not happening at noon on Peoria Ave. They have refunded us a few times, but it's not always successful. Got 1 gift card, too. 

However, this is even IF you can get them on the phone. More than a few times, after the phone rings 10 times, we've sat on hold for 10 minutes in slot #1 in the automated queue. Then called back, and had the same thing happen...

This is the only PeiWei like this that I've encountered. We like what they offer, but it's hit or miss whether they will actually deliver the product that every other store has no issue executing correctly. 

There's LOTS of competition around them, and a lot of businesses in the area that will spend a few hundred dollars a week on lunch. I know where my money won't be going anymore...

Sorry, PeeWee, you're out of our lunch rotation for good."}
{"text":"I waited forever for our food and it was just two of us. The entrees were incredibly bland. I will probably not return

Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Just ordered the small Thai Dynamite with chicken and my plate came with 5 lumps of meat. After spending $7 I figured I would at least get a decent meal. A small shouldn't automatically mean meager."}
{"text":"Rude service, older lady named Christine I think. She kept interrupting me \"for here or to go\" \"what's your name\" \"small or regular\". Like hold on lady I'm getting there. Besides there was nobody behind me. She just treated me like a huge inconvience and couldn't wait to get my order through. I wouldn't care if the food was good, but my chicken breading was soggy and the inside was pipping hot. It reminds me of tv dinner chicken out of the microwave. Waste of $10."}
{"text":"Went there today. Pretty good. Experience was disappointing because one person in our group of four didn't get his meal until the rest of us were almost done eating. His dish was the same as another in our group. They must have just forgot or messed up the order"}
{"text":"I am definitely not a chain food snob or else I wouldn't go here. We had Pei Wei before in Salt Lake City and loved it so we decided to take the kids here. The food was still good and I would go back, but....the portion of the dish as opposed to rice was way out of proportion. Very little dish and way too much rice. The mongolian beef and honeyed chicken, as well as the pad thai bowl were still tasty though. We didn't really enjoy the egg rolls. The service was fine. We love those coke machines that give you endless options. Try Fanta peach, super yummy. Prices were as expected. I'd go back, but I'd like a bit more of my food."}
{"text":"Always good food, affordable and clean. Their new coke machines are min blowing."}
{"text":"I found myself at Pei Wei TWICE in the last 10 days! I normally don't like going to eat much but I couldn't resist after hair their ginger broccoli chicken dish last week. This review isn't really about the food but I love that you can now order sauces on the side and add extra veggies. 

I wanted to give a shoutout to JayJay ( I'm not sure if that's his real name as I asked another employee and she said she didnt know his name but everyone calls him JayJay - super short hair and glasses). He was our cashier and super knowledgeable about the everything on the menu. My husband and I asked a lot of questions about sauces, the chicken wrap and so many others. He was super patient! 

And then we came in again tonight (Tuesday) and I didn't catch her name but she's brunette with a long pony tail and has a tattoo covering her right forearm. I asked her questions about my honey chicken and vegetables and how it was such a small amount compared to last time and she offered to bring more vegetables. What a way to make someone's dining experience even better. Thank you for being so friendly !"}
{"text":"Rather bland and the minor flame next to the entrées is an accurate depiction of the level of spice and heat you'll receive."}
{"text":"Once in a while we like to come to a Pei wei for a meal.  Today this location was super dirty.  90% of the empty tables were a total mess.  And he restaurant had maybe 15 people in it.  The patio was so dirty that napkins and garbage were flying all over.  But we were already ordering and had to get a quick meal.  I watched the bus boy drop the cloth on the floor, pick it up and continue to clean tables.  Disgrace.

Food was okay for fast food.  Potstickers were a favorite, the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles - chicken was so overcooked my son could not chew it.  Passed on that.
Crab Rangoon was okay....maybe because it had peppers and what seemed like fresh shredded crab but I did miss that creamy inside.  Kung poa was tasty and went over well. I had the crunchy California role and I thought it was really good.

Decent food but disgusting location.  Maybe just a bad day."}
{"text":"Nice place besides the fact that the Honey Seared chicken was a total ripoff. Check out the picture posted on the page. I got 7 small pieces of chicken for the 7 bucks I paid for the dish. See ya at Panda!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Pei Wei for a late dinner.  Despite being packed the staff was very friendly and did not seem harried like another location I visit.

Our food was done in a reasonable amount of time and delivered to the table. 

The Kung Pao chicken was good to very good.   Light on spiciness despite ordering extra but they did have the sambal olek sauce available to spice things up.  

The chicken teriyaki was good.  Even the toddler with us had some and liked it.

We also had a bit of confusion.  I attempted to get two orders of pad thai; one to go and one to eat there.  Unfortunately I did not review the order at the ordering station.  When I wondered where the second order of paid thai was when our food was delivered I checked the receipt and noted it was not there.  Pei Wei brought us a second order anyway with out charging.

All in all the food was good but the service was far above what I expect at Pei Wei.  It was a nice end for  a long day."}
{"text":"Placed an online order and the chicken was dry with very little sauce. Depends on the time you go, during rush hour they seem to just give the left overs for online orders. :("}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite go to take out spots. My favorites are the Thai Dynamite Shrimp with fried rice, the pot stickers, Vietnamese salad rolls and the lettuce wraps. I've also recently been trying out their new sushi and then definitely have it figure out! Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"This location is always busy, usually order food to go. Always get teriyaki Tofu and it is hit or miss depending on the cooks that night. 

Customer service is the same way, some days your order is ready on time and correct and other days you wait 20 minutes past the pick up time for your food which turns out to be wrong anyways. 

Order from them less often than I would like to due to issues, Quick take out runs that turn into an hour long ordeal are never fun."}
{"text":"Loved how everything is made fresh! The portion size is huge...definitely two meals worth. I have only tries their pad thai. Which I had never had anywhere previously but I loved it. That is the only thing I've ordered from here and will definitely be back for more later. Great place!"}
{"text":"Okay first off Pei wei is yum , but this location is filthy i certainly hope the owner reads this because your restaurant needs a deep cleaning. The doors as you come in are covered in greasy hand prints looks like it hasnt been cleaned in days , the fountain machine  was worse. And the tables were sticky and gross. I hope my next visit its changed or i wont be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to Pei Wei restaurants all over the north valley and the quality of the food does vary.  This particular restaurant is/was one of the better ones until I had the Pad Thai noodles with tofu take out last night.  Excellent actually until I started chewing on the rubber band in my food. Lost all interest after that.  Disappointed to say the least - I understand that they probably have no issues 99% of the time but I won't be going back for awhile, if at all."}
{"text":"Consistently get bad service here. After waiting 25 mins for our food this week, and asking for the manager twice, we did receive some great coupons. Hope service is better when I decide to use mine!"}
{"text":"OK. First off, let me just say that I love Pei Wei. It is a great concept, and it's a great chain. In general, you can get good quality, fresh, tasty food at Pei Wei.

Now. About this PARTICULAR Pei Wei. They closed down for a while because Sheriff Joe decided that there were too many illegals working here.I came one day for lunch and BAM! Gone. It took them more than a month to get open again, which I suppose means finding non-illegals who can use a wok and a cash register.

I say: bring back the illegals.

At the new, All-American Pei Wei, the girl running the register seemed non-plussed to be receiving cash. She stared at it for quite a while, and then commenced to guess how much money she should give us in return. She got it right on the third try. Yay, Arizona schools!

As for the meal. Apparently, legal Amurricans don't get kung pao, because mine was like a salt lick. Now, I loves me some salt, but seriously. Two deer came by my table and started licking my plate.

I was like: get, deer! Get!. 

It's sad, because this is the closest Pei Wei to where we live, and I like close. But the one down in Chandler near Priest and the I-10 is about a million times better at this point. Also, they have a computerized soda machine, which sweetens the deal. Did you know they have like eight varieties of Fanta? Me neither."}
{"text":"If you that this food is even going to resemble PF Changs, you're in for a rude awakening.  The service is great, but the food is far from great.  I'm not ever planning on visiting again.  There are a ton of other Chinese food restaurants in the area that offer much better, less expensive menus."}
{"text":"I ordered the honey seared crispy chicken.  It was good; it was very good.  But the prices are way too high and the portions make me sad."}
{"text":"We use to love Pei Wei, but lately the foodhas not been that great. We ordered take out and my husband had the chicken terriyaki. He had huge chunks of onions in his veggies and was sweet. My Mongolian beef was very salty and I couldn't even finish it. The pork eggrolls were also oily when we took a bite. Disappointing. We will no longer be going to Pei Wei and just support the local restaurants."}
{"text":"We recently visited after a two year absence due to long waits and no place to sit.  Well, we loved our food so much a week ago that last night we ordered dinner online.  I took a picture of the screen and sent it to my husband, to make sure they got our order right.  When he got there, there was no record of our order.  (It was my first time ordering online for this restaurant, so it could have been my error since we did not get a confirmation e-mail.) 

Well, the manager was really nice.  He told my husband that he'd push our order to the front.  Our order was ready really fast, and we were very appreciative!  We quit going to Pei Wei's due to service and lack of seating, but they definitely have our business again.  The new Quinoa menu item sure helped.  :-)"}
{"text":"I have to start this review with a disclaimer.  I love pei wei.  We have gone there for years.  They have great food and wonderful service.

HOWEVER, 
I took my family of six to this location this weekend to celebrate my son's birthday and we very disappointed.  

First of all, they did not have enough clean glasses for us to use and two of us had to use paper cups for our drinks.  There were no lemon or orange slices available for our drinks.  The napkins were actually a stack of paper towels from the restroom.  There were not enough forks available for my family.  Over half the stack of plates had food on them or were otherwise dirty.  Out of the two soda machines only one was working, the other had ice overflowing and falling on the floor.  When they brought the lettuce wraps, the lettuce was so tiny, you could hardly use it.  When the food came, the portions were really small.  I had honey seared chicken and it did not have scallions or bell peppers in it.  (like the menu clearly states).  I took it up to the counter to ask and the person told me \"scallions and peppers are just garnishes and sometimes they are not put on the food.\"  Why he was explain that to me, another person took a plate of scallions and peppers and dumped them on my plate.  I explained that my daughter had the same meal with the same issue, but they did nothing about hers.  As I turned around to go back to my table, I almost bumped into a woman, I stopped and politely said excuse me and she said, \"just move\".  Come to find out that woman was actually the manager!  Not a good experience, don't know when I will go back!!"}
{"text":"Ain't eating here until they stop getting bad health inspection grades from the Maricopa county inspectors :

https://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodInspection?p=FD-08048&i=4278269"}
{"text":"This is like PF Chang's, Junior. If you're a fan of PF Chang's but you want something a little less expensive, this is your place. The spicy chicken tastes the same at both places. The Mongolian Beef is very different at Pei Wei; I don't like it much. Staff is very friendly, but they close a bit early. I love it!"}
{"text":"I liked this place but didn't love it. 

I wanted to like it more, the concept of fast cooked to order gourmet food was very exciting to me! They have great lunch specials but I opted for the steak lo mein...the food was hot when it arrived at the table but I didn't like the flavors. It tasted very sweet to me, and was not a good compliment to the steak. I did like the way the steak was prepared though, very tender and juicy. 

I will give them one more try but I will make sure to select another item on the menu. With all the great reviews, I'm hoping for a great next visit."}
{"text":"This place has HORRIBLE service. I stood in line for over 15 minutes while the lady at the crash register didn't know how to work it. Tables weren't clean, there is no where to sit, and the workers don't seem to concerned with making customers happy. Very disappointed in this place, after coming here for years. Not to mention the soda machines suck. Won't be returning!"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all.I had chicken teriyaki with noodles. The chicken tasted as if it had been saved from yesterday and the noodles were not even warm so needless to say this was a waste of money. My guy chose Spicey Korean shrimp which had no heat meaning spice. Loved Pei Wei in Cali but this location gets a thumbs down. Won't be a repeat visit for me."}
{"text":"I personally love Pei Wei. It may not be authentic but it is delicious!

This location always has helpful staff and consistently well-made dishes. It can be hard to find a table during peak times, but the staff is good about clearing tables quickly. 

I find that Pei Wei offers ample portions (more so when dining in) and quick take-out. You can call ahead or order online. 

I highly recommend honey seared chicken on white rice with extra sauce (no charge). The spring rolls are also a favorite--love that chili sauce!  The only downside to the spring rolls is that they don't do too well after being refrigerated. Eat them while they're still warm!

My parents and brothers are all vegetarians so we always get tofu when eating as a family.  Lately, the tofu at this location has been sub-par.  They don't seem to cook it quite long enough, and that has definitely cut back on the frequency of our visits.  Hopefully this changes, because the tofu here is usually amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my #1 take-out restaurant. I call in my order, give my phone number, and they know it's me. It's quick and easy. I have take-out menu at my house and order my dinner for the evening. Most times it only take 15 minutes, therefore by the time I order, I get in my car to travel to Pei Wei. I get out of my car (they have a location where you can park in if you are grabbing and going). In the end, I come home, have a nice dinner! I even have leftovers too! Out of all I said, remember it's quick and easy!"}
{"text":"I don't understand it, the flavors and the way it's put together I can never enjoy this place. There is better Chinese food out there."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. They have prompt service, their people are polite and courteous, the rolls are really quite good, especially for not being a traditional sushi spot. Best of all, I can see into the kitchen so I know the chef has picked his nose while preparing my food."}
{"text":"Ordered online and my food was ready, hot, and delicious. Cute girl behind the counter was very sweet and efficient. Love Pei Wei every now and then they are a bit pricy for the amount of \"protein\" to rice equation. Other then that. Its Fabulosity."}
{"text":"The food has always been good.  They seem to always be short on help, but the help they have do their best when busy.  Several times we have visited they were out of napkins, silverware and fortune cookies.  I noted it to one of the help and it took quite some time to be taken care of.
Also one time we were there and ordered lettuce wraps.  The wraps came without the sauce due to no ramen cups available.  Half way thru my meal the sauce still was not delivered and I noticed others ate their lettuce wraps with no sauce due to \"ramen cups not available\"? Seems strange...Might need more help or better management."}
{"text":"I've been to this Pei Wei many times since it's close to my work, and in general I like it.  The Teriyaki and Thai Dynamite are my favorite dishes and I've had them on multiple occasions.

I've been wanting to try one of their salads for a while, but naturally their regular food always seemed way more appetizing by the time it was my turn to order.  Unfortunately (as I later found) I finally built up the willpower and ordered the \"Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad\" at lunch last week ... what a huge mistake.  Just imagine a bowl of romaine and iceberg lettuce, topped with boiling-hot, saucy chicken.  It's like they literally took the top part of their Pei Wei Spicy dish and put it directly on lettuce instead of rice.  The result was lettuce that was all warm and wilted ... and totally gross.

Maybe it was my fault for thinking the chicken on this salad would just be *somewhat* flavored like the entree dish (instead of a direct swap of lettuce for rice), but it was awful.  I couldn't stomach the wilty hot lettuce and just picked out the chicken and some of the tomatoes & carrots.  

Pei Wei - I still love your other food, but this dish has no place on your menu."}
{"text":"Woooo was this place busy busy on Friday night! We had dinner here and to our surprise when we got there the line was OUT THE DOOR. We were all the way passed the water fountain. 

Several people gave up on waiting before us and so the wait ended up not being too bad. We looked over the menu and unfortunately on this night they didn't have the Korean spicy entree, boo. So we decided to try other dishes. 

Our orders were one small dish of the chicken teriyaki with white rice, one order of the pad thai, (my favorite) and a dish of the spicy steak and shrimp ramen noodle dish. 

When we finally placed our order at the counter, the cashier was so friendly!!! He let us know why they were so busy on this night and he went ahead and gave us the deal of the day. (Buy one entree and get one fo free) 

Tables were definitely hard to come by, but the two servers serving and the manager, were doing such a great job running around cleaning tables and serving as well. We sat down and waited. We knew it was going to be a wait since it was crazy busy. My dish (the pad thai) and my dads (the spicy noodle plate) came out about 20 minutes after we sat down. My sisters dish though did not come out with ours. So she waited and waited. The server came out to us twice and she informed us she had talked to the kitchen and was going to send out the manager.

The manager was very friendly when he came over to us to fix the situation. He let us know he was going to upgrade her dish to a bigger size and take it off the bill.

Her food eventually did come on out and she was happy. Everything tasted great and fresh. The way the manager handled our situation was the best. He truly cared about us his customers and made sure to take care of the situation the proper way. 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very fast food. Good service. Food was average. The workers are friendly. Many menu items that were traditional such as orange chicken are gone. Menu choices were lacking...:("}
{"text":"We tried to eat here twice in the past month, both times at 7:30 on Saturday night.  Dining area was 1/2 full both times, but we were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait to get served.  Manager tonight refused to give us his name or contact information.  Said to just call corporate office if we had a complaint.  Poor business model that can't serve people in the restaurant because they are too busy with phone orders.  Guess they really can't compete with Panda Express.  It doesn't matter how fresh your $5 orange chicken is if it takes 45 minutes to get it.   Poor service, poor management, poor business plan."}
{"text":"Driving south on Eastern after being in class all morning, I needed to stop for a quick lunch but  wanted good food,not just fast food. Stopped at Pei Wei. I ordered Spicy Chicken. My  buddy had a salad. My dish had a good amount of stir fried chicken with a mixture of stir fried vegetables  and some rice. Very tasty and not too spicy. More than enough for a lunch portion, all for under $7. My buddy had a lunch salad. It was a large portion. He reported that it was delicious. This is an excelent alternative to a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Very good food but the Waitress and Waiters need training and knowledge about what are they doing. I would call them Dish Transporters cause they don't have a clue about what they are doing. The bring you Appetizer with Entree's at the same time. You tell them that save your plate for later cause in your table is going to get cold and they take it and leave it sitting in the counter when they bring it back to you it's COLD AS ICE. Management should train them and tell them the difference between an Appetizer and an Entree. 
Bad bad bad service"}
{"text":"Never made it to the counter to order.  Long line and employee just standing twiddling her hair at the online to go counter not helping."}
{"text":"I've been there a few dozen times and it never occurred to me to review them. As soon as I find something I like I get it every time from then on out. So every time I order the steak thai coconut curry with rice and extra sauce on the side. I can happily say, I've NEVER been disappointed. This has to be my favorite asian cuisine restaurant, and it doesn't hurt my wallet."}
{"text":"Awful service here, ordered my food and waited for almost an hour. I went up to the counter and asked what was going on and they said that they called my number and tried buzzing me and I didnt respond, however I was literally sitting right in front of them the entire time, they never called me and the buzzer never went off. Instead of apologizing, the guy just blamed me. The food is also way overpriced as well. Do NOT go here."}
{"text":"Decent food expected at pei wei but the 20 minute wait after ordering take out 35 minutes in advance...unacceptable. There are a lot of local Asian fare restaurants that deserve the business more and will serve you faster. Bye bye pei wei summit."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. Was there recently on a Saturday night around 730 pm. Not sure if they were understaffed but it took over 30 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered. Dirty, unbussed tables. Aloof order taker. Manager was frantically trying to expedite orders but other employees working very slowly. One extra stat for the fact that the good was good once we got it."}
{"text":"What I love about Pei Wei is that they cook the food to order.  It isn't steam table food.  Their Mongolian Beef is a real winner.  The meat is tender, not chewy, and because it is cooked fresh, the thicker pieces still have a faint pink inside."}
{"text":"DO NOT eat at this Pei Wei if you are gluten free or have any serious food allergies or dietary restrictions. I frequently eat at Pei Wei, and have eaten at multiple locations without ever having a problem or confusion about ordering gluten free. My fiancé and I visited this location because it was close by, and ordered online to pick up our food. When we showed up, they said they had \"never received our order\", so we ordered our food for eat in instead. I specified with the cashier that my meal was gluten free when ordering, as I have a serious wheat allergy and will be very ill if I eat anything with wheat in it, or cross contaminated with wheat. When the server brought our food, I noticed right away that my chicken looked breaded, and not like the regular gluten free chicken I order. I asked the server to confirm that it was gluten free, because usually GF meals are served on a black plate at all Pei Wei locations (mine was a white plate). The server told me \"oh, we don't do the black plate thing\".. really? Because every other Pei Wei I've been to knows what I'm talking about. I asked him to go and double check that my meal was gluten free, so he goes back to the computer and looks at the order (doesn't ask the chefs) and comes back and tells me \"Yes, it is gluten free\". I take a bite and notice that no, it is obviously not gluten free. I look at the receipt, and my order was not even rang up gluten free! So our server basically made that up (without it saying gluten free on our ticket, order receipt, or asking the chef to confirm), and came back and told us it was anyway. My fiancé then goes and gets the manager (I believe Miranda) who refunded only my food, and not my fiancé's as well, even though we both now have to leave and cannot finish our lunch. She looked at my food and said she wasn't really sure if it was made gluten free or not, and it was never even put on the ticket, but since she didn't know she would just remake it. Then, she proceeded to lecture my fiancé and I was to how you can tell if it's actually GF or not, as if it's our job to know the difference, instead of her staff being educated about how to prepare basic menu items without cross contamination, or even making them with the right ingredients. Maybe if you spent a little time training your staff about proper food handling procedures, you wouldn't have problems like this happen. The entire time we were there, the manager never asked the server about it or asked him what happened, showing she doesn't really care if this happens again or why it was even an issue (he straight up lied to our face because he was too lazy to care or ask someone to double check). It is completely unacceptable for any restaurant to have this type of service, especially one with such a large gluten free menu. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there for dinner last night and as always, the Chopped Asian chix Salad rocked! It's my favorite thing to eat at this place. We also had the Chix Coconut Curry. Both the dishes did not disappoint. The staff could be friendlier and more courteous. They look like they so not know how to smile & they look like they're just there because it's work.  At Pei w Wei you get the Pf Chang tasting food at a cheaper price. I understand that Pei Wei is Pf Chang's wife's creation. I love the food but the staff could get a lesson or two about customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite is the Crunchy Wasabi Sushi!! Otherwise we share the King Pow Chicken with extra chicken, fried rice and extra peanuts! Gustavo, in the kitchen, is always so friendly, happy, and personable! We love our neighborhood Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great food, friendly staff but I was appalled with the wait time. I came in and ordered two entrees to go and for some reason it took 30 minutes. If I had known that it would take so long I would have dined in, because they obviously put dine in guests in front of to go orders. By the time the manager came by we had just received our food. I thought it was absolutely ridiculous to wait that long for 2 items. They need to get a better system, other than that the food is great"}
{"text":"I always order the Kung Pao chicken but it has been a bit dry lately. It's still my favorite dish and I think it's a good value. Love the concept and one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Very clean and staff is always friendly. I usually order the honey seared chicken but decided to switch it up. I ordered the Thai dynamite and it had a weird, almost chemical taste. I will go back but will stick to my usual order."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot. The young staff here is great and we seldom notice turnover. The food is always excellent and the quality is consistent.  The menu offers great variety with healthy and unique choices. Even if the restaurant is busy with a line hanging out the door, it's still worth the wait (and it's usually a reasonable wait). I love that when the place is busy they'll ensure you have a spot to sit before they take your order. Nice patio seating on the east side of the building.  This is our fave Pei Wei in the area."}
{"text":"This is an awful location. The food was terrible, somehow they made shrimp look non distinct... how do you even do that? The pieces of shrimp were not recognizable. 
The server brought out food and offered no plates or anything even though we were sharing. Not a big deal because I understand that this is fast casual but any other Pei Wei I have been to had plates on the table for sharing. 
Bottle of soy sauce was covered in filth. Indicative this place is not somewhere I would want to eat. 
Gross, save your money."}
{"text":"The gal who took our order never looked at us and seemed disinterested (at best) in taking our order. I was less than impressed with the customer service!

Following the completion of a poor customer survey, I had three contacts about my concerns (two from their corporate offices and one from the location manager). All were very responsive and apologized for the substandard service. I certainly appreciate the commitment to making things right. After a quality response like that, I am willing to give them one more shot at earning my business back."}
{"text":"I went there today to eat with my mom. The place was filthy, dirty dishes by the soda machine, I mean dirty with food still on them, no only one plate was dirty, no 2, but at 4th dirty plate a guy walked by me checked them all and told me: yes they look dirty and took only those 4 plates, left the rest there! 
The place seems like they don't care about anything. My to go order was all WRONG. The Guy at cashier was bother by taking the order, didn't want to explain the dishes, the result : 
One of the dish was the most spicy version they had, ended in the trash!!! 
They never has been the cleanest rest in town but today I was disgusted by how terrible everything looked!!!!"}
{"text":"staff needs to slow down and listen to the customer, seems like a young and inexperienced wait and register staff, food was cold and got the order wrong.."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot and enjoy the food.  I have learned to tolerate the service level which is usually below expectation.  In fairness to the restaurant, they do get swamped at various times and it taxes the employees and their ability to provide quick efficient service.  I find if I'm there during non peak times the service is a little better."}
{"text":"Second year in a row we went on NYE. 5pm Reservation arrived 5 minutes early & was seated right away. We got lucky & had Tara as our server 2nd year in a row. Great service. Food is always great"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I ordered last minute catering for 30 people 2 hours before my in-service. The man up front helped me tremendously and made sure the food was done ON TIME and it was packed and ready to go for me. The food was DELICIOUS and I couldn't be happier with my experience with them. I will most definitely be using this place again for catering and I would highly recommend this location for catering for anyone else as well. Their customer service is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Pei Wei food, but I am frequently picking up food from this location for other people. It gets extremely busy during lunch hour, and I'm always amazed by how the staff manages to get through it every day. Bridget and Makayla (I hope I didn't slaughter the spelling) are always running around doing so much when I come in! But they never fail to wow me with their service. These two super stars deserve a raise. 
As far as the restaurant goes, it does get extremely busy at times, which I could see might be frustrating for customers that are trying to get in and out quick. Best time to come is NOT during lunch rush. If you are going to come during lunch hour, I recommend ordering take out online. 
Parking is very difficult to figure out during this time as well. I wonder if they will expand the lot."}
{"text":"Used love this place because of the orange peel chicken. They changed it to the \"wei better orange\". Let's just say if I wanted Panda Express I would have gone there. Very disappointed in the new orange chicken."}
{"text":"I wish Pei Wei was nationwide, because it's one of my favorites! This is a great location with a nice staff and clean tables. The line moves pretty slow but overall a great place. This location has sushi and it was pretty good. I recommend the caramel chicken, but everything smells amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is 4 stars, always delicious & hardly any errors. Service is what earned the one star, they never answer the phone & when you do order online they tell you its not working correctly. I just come here because it's the closest one to me  boo haha."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this pei wei doesn't have higher ratings. I order to-go pretty often and have never been disappointed with the food; my order comes out in a timely manner & is very warm, and it's not difficult to get utensils/sauce. I appreciate that they have a separate to-go area. Their chili sauce is awesome too.
 
I've dined in before too, and the service was great. If anything, food is overpriced, but it's a few steps higher than panda!

Pei wei has a really good selection and a lot of ways to make dishes healthier, like steaming or getting brown rice. That's a good quality of the pei wei chain in general."}
{"text":"It's hit and miss here. Sometimes it's the best ever and other times we feel we wasted our money."}
{"text":"Had the Thai Chicken Coconut Curry with brown rice and it was very tasty. Also try the Mandarin Orange Green Iced Tea. Very clean and fast..."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The service was great and food came out fast and hot. I got my usual honey seared chicken. It did not taste as it usually does. It wasn't as sweet as it should be. One soap dispenser was out of soap. 

Overall, it was good and quick. I would go back."}
{"text":"I hope for Pei Wei's sake, this is the worst location in the chain. Over the past several months, I've called them for take-out on a Friday night coming from Scottsdale. During my 45 minute drive, I just get the endless loop recording. When I arrive, there isn't anyone in line, the cashiers are all just standing around. They said their phone wasn't working. Two weeks later, same thing happened. When I arrived at the store, they told me I had to wait in line to order! So frustrating after being on hold for 30 minutes. One time I arrived and found about 30 people in line with the same complaints about ordering over the phone. Also, the internet orders didn't go through. One of the cashiers suggested next time I should order online. I informed her that  wasn't a good idea when driving. Tonight I tried again to call in my order so it would be ready for pickup by the time I got across town. Again, a continuous loop of the prerecorded message. After 30 minutes, I hung up and went to Panda. This location is terrible and management doesn't seem to care. I gave them four chances. Waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"This food is so darn salty I'll be drinking water all day. Food came fresh but barely warm. I got the Mongolian beef. Probably not a good place for people with high blood pressure unless you want the salads"}
{"text":"I really, REALLY want to love Pei Wei...but every time we leave disappointed.  I order the same thing every time.  Teriyaki Bowl.. brown rice, add broccoli. I always ask for my vegetables to be cooked. I love broccoli and snap peas... But not raw. 

Everytime I get raw onions.. and barely warmed up veggies. 

Tonight we sat at the counter and watched them cook everything.  Our order took 28 minutes. We got our lettuce wraps at same time as dinner orders... I watched my order get cooked and I knew it was going to suck.  My veggies weren't even in the wok for 10 seconds. Got 3 chunks of broccoli.. raw.. not even warm in the middle. 

There isn't even any point in sending it back.. they just don't take the time to accommodate requests. Chicken was mealy little chunks.. not big meaty ones like we have had before. 

Oh yeah..  and we tried the new orange chicken. It's horrible.  Flavorless fried chicken scraps. Not even enough sauce to coat the chicken.  I hate Panda Express..  but their orange chicken is 10x better than PEI WEI."}
{"text":"So sad to now feel so differently then I did 2 years ago when I gave this location 5 stars. What used to be consistently good has over the past year gone down and down. I happily used promotions the past two days that I was sent via email ( free orange chicken w/purchase of a regular entree). Yesterday 2 of the 3 entrees I ordered were fine but my Mongolian beef was horrible. Against my better judgement, I went there for take out again today....This time all 3 entrees were terrible. Flavorless, chewy chicken...a bunch of tofu in pad Thai that was ordered w/only chicken. I hate feeling like I just wasted money but that's exactly how I'm feeling. Bummer because this place used to be my go to place."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of the Pei Wei chain.  We are semi-regulars at the location at the District at Tustin Legacy in Irvine, California and love it.  We were on a weekend trip to watch Spring Training Games in Arizona and this location was very close to the hotel we were staying at.  The restaurant is starting to show its wear and age.  It appears to be an older shop in the chain.  Things started off on the wrong foot with the gentleman that took our order. We asked for our usual order of Lo Mein with Beef and Kung Pao Shrimp and a side order of Pot Stickers.  Our order taker added extra shrimp to our Lo Mein instead of the Kung Pao Shrimp that we had ordered, so we only had one item for a family of four. Once the food came out, it was very evident that the quality was not what we were accustomed to from our usual location.  The beef was a bit fattier, and the overall dish was much greasier than we were accustomed.  The potstickers were seriously over cooked  were dry and had very bad flavor.  We then waited for a while for our Kung Pao that never came.  Once we figured out that there had been a mistake on the order, I went over to the front desk and brought it to their attention.  The manager recognized the mistake and to her credit said that she would handle it.  I offered to pay since I recognize that the order taker may not have heard me since it was very loud in the restaurant.  However the manager made our food and delivered it to us at no additional charge.  That was very good in my book.  The kung pao shrimp was definitely much better than the other two items that we had.  While I like Pei Wei very much the food at this location was not up to the standard that we are used to from this chain."}
{"text":"The service was great and the noodle dish I ordered was good as well. The 3 star rating is because the sushi was literally a joke, I would give it 0 stars if I could... It was pre made and almost all rice. They cover every roll both too and bottom so you have to really work at clearing away the sauce to see how pitiful the roll portions are... nice try! I would recommend pre made sushi from any grocery store over this place and that's saying a lot considering the quality at grocery stores."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times. Food has always been great. Today for cyber Monday they offer a 20% off coupon if you order online. Unfortunately their website crashes and will not take an order over the phone and give you the 20% off. Pretty lame"}
{"text":"Don't know what's happening tonight but there are a lot of tables that are not being picked up.  I hope that they hire more people to keep up with the demand"}
{"text":"Please just don't waste your time, or money here. It's trash. 

Made an order online at 8pm, arrive at 8:30pm to pick it up only to be told that they don't have sushi. They've had that ticket for 30min and NO ONE could call/email that they were out of sushi? Laziness. 

Rest of the food was gross, the rice bowls had very low portions of protein, but tons of old stale rice to make up for it. 

You should just eat out of the trash can outside, at least you'd get your money's worth."}
{"text":"The Pei Wei in Ballantyne is very consistent on quality and service.  Changes to dish are easy and the wait time is within' acceptable limits. I sometimes go here for lunch and order either the Orange Peel or the Spicy Korean (creature of habit).  They have one Coke (black) Freestyle machine, which means you may have to wait to get your drink (however, they do have Dr. Pepper!!!).  The place will get packed during lunch time, so go early or later.  

Be careful how you park in the parking lot, the spaces are narrow!  If you go during lunch time, it is easier to park at the CVS/pharmacy."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab some quick Asian food made fresh to order. They have many options that will please just about everyone, except that one guy- but he's never happy so who cares, amiright?

Pei Wei has online ordering which is very helpful and easy to use. In addition they have a new points program where you can earn meals based on your purchases there. Easy to use and free Pei Wei is always a good thing. 

Run, don't wok to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is consistently fresh, tasty, and a good value.

This location is no different, and during the rainy storm of the century last week, it did the trick for a great lunch.

I don 't know a ton about this area, so I can't help much, other than saying it's in a strip mall, surrounded by other retail stores. If you've been in one Pei Wei, you've essentially been in them all. The one strange thing with this location, is that near the drink section, there are a row of bar style seats. They are nice looking, but when people are sitting in them, they pretty much block the pathway from the beverage section to the main seating area. Weird.

Anyway, if you are in need of a tasty, predictable lunch, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Overall good. The person you order from must be new. She didn't have very good knowledge about the menu. She put my appetizer in last so my actual food came out before the app. Quick service and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"I find myself again disappointed in Pei Wei. I was looking for healthy options near my office, which is near Metro. I've been to Pei Wei before in the past and never was super impressed, but felt it was an okay option if I wanted something with actual vegetables in it.

I ordered the fried rice with tofu and extra vegetables. I ordered it for pick up, online, and the whole process was fine. The food was ready when I got there, and I like the pick up parking.

When I opened up my lunch, however, I was really disappointed in the amount of vegetables. I paid $1 for EXTRA vegetables, only to find 2 pieces of broccoli, probably 6-8 snap peas, and a bunch of shredded carrots. This seemed really cheap to me - as carrots were probably the cheapest vegetable. I would have liked some more broccoli or some green vegetable. I was expecting a bit more, given that I paid a whole dollar more. I would hate to see what this dish looks like without \"extra\" vegetables.

The tofu was good - there was a lot of it. Which makes me wonder did they mistake the \"extra vegetables\" for \"extra tofu\"? Not sure how that is possible since I ordered it online. Anyways, the food was really over salted. It left an odd thirsty feeling in my mouth for hours after I ate it. This has happened before when eating at Pei Wei, I suspect they cook with processed ingredients or add some kind of additive to their food. 

For the price of the food it's not worth it. I paid $10 for a place of processed, overly salted fried rice. This includes the $1 I paid for some \"extra\" vegetables - probably an extra snap pea and an extra pinch of carrots (not worth a dollar). I won't be coming back there, even if I'm in a pinch. There are lots of other restaurants coming in, I am sure I'll find something healthier and more worth the price for lunch."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of those places that can somehow get away with inconsistent meals. The theme is cool; the place is clean; and the quality of the food seems above average. You have to know what to order though because a few of the meals do not have any flavor. I recommend the kung pao or ginger chicken."}
{"text":"Love most of the food choices and service. Today I ordered a traditional wok dish with the option to convert to lettuce wraps. I was very disappointed to find that my dish was drowning in sauce. Doesn't make for a very healthy or easy option in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not bad Pei Wei!.. I ordered the Japanese Teriyaki Bowl with fried rice and It was good, I also added some of the chilli paste that Pei Wei has and it just made it that much better. I have not tried any other dishes here, but I can honestly say i enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"When we walked in the girl at the counter was inattentive and nonchalant. We wanted to dine in and she told us that it was a 35 minute wait cause there was no table available, then asked to take our order. As we were looking at the menu I looked around and there was a table available, so I asked if it was available, she said sure. So we ordered and went to sit down, the table and everything in the dining area was dirty!!!  The table had been cleared but not wiped. So sorry to say but the cleanliness of the restaurant was awful (1 star). The customer service was also awful (1 star). We were just glad the food was excellent (5 star). So if you want take out, it's perfect!!! Don't recommend dine in!!"}
{"text":"I tried ordering on line and use a coupon.  Later to learn it doesn't work and they know it doesn't!   So I go into the restaurant and waited...only to leave with half my order!   It just shouldn't be this hard to get a meal!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei. I usual really like the Vietnamese chicken salad rolls. I was super disappointed to get mine today as the salad was watery or something. It made for slimy rice paper and a roll that just fell apart. It was pretty gross."}
{"text":"I really like pei wei and I'm seating  here a lot this time it's looks like the kitchen in a mess I was waiting in line 15 min and anther 25 min for my food. The manager saw that my food is taking that much time and didn't even try to come over to say they sorry."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at! I don't really care for the \"so-called\" spring rolls or the salads that they serve on their menu. I do however have a liking for their thai basil chicken with white rice! Yum... Good service, good food and good price. Beware, it can get really busy and loud during dinner time so good luck trying to hear yourself talk."}
{"text":"Pei Wei Mongolian beef used to be the best ever but seriously I went today and got two pieces of meat and 50 mushrooms and it was the worst I've ever had. So very disappointed. I really love Pei Wei but this makes me rethink everything. I don't know what's happened but the quality has suffered big big big time."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time and my fave was the Asian Coconut Curry but then they discontinued it. I was upset and stopped going for a few years. I recently started back and my new fave is the pad thai. I also love the Vietnamese Spring Rolls with the peanut sauce. Well, my last two visits weren't the best. a few weeks ago my pad thai didn't seem to have much flavor, like they didn't put on enough sauce and they forgot to give me the lime wedge. Monday evening (6/11), I ordered it along with the Vietnamese rolls. The pad thai was good except the lime wedge was used. It had already been squeezed. I really hope they didn't pull it off someone's used plate. Also, there were some burnt pieces in my pad thai. I'm not sure if this is under new management or what, but it isn't as good as it was a few years ago. I see reviews that the dining area is dirty. I always order take out so I never notice. Kind of makes me rethink ever going there especially after getting the used lime. They really need to clean up their place, focus on quality control."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this place.  I used to love it but since they've changed to the new menu, it's not been good.  They got rid of the Caramel Chicken and the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  I'm okay with that because I understand that change can be good, just disappointed.  The biggest problem is the quality - the taste is just off and items are missing that used to be included, like a lime wedge with the Pad Thai.  The last two times the food has tasted a bit stale and lacking in flavor.  I have to say I'm not looking forward to eating there anytime soon."}
{"text":"First off, we like Peiwei! My partner and I are here on a Sunday evening, after placing our dine-in order, orange chicken and beef pad Thai; we waited 20 minutes and the orange chicken came; however, I wait another 10 mins (30 mins) and my beef pad Thai still hasn't come out; I went in and asked the staff, and was told there \"a lot of online order tickets\" ahead of mine; and I must wait at least another 15 mins for my order...I am thinking I had to wait 45 minutes for a dine-in order when the restaurant is not even busy...this is just terrible."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great food & service.  Awesome place & phad Thai is my fave.  Ordered to go with sauce on side instructions & was ready to go upon pick up time ."}
{"text":"Let's just say I don't go to eat the food. ;)

The place is close, it is fast. I don't know what else you need from Asain Market but keep doing  what you are doing. And I'll keep coming in and pretending that I come their for the food.

Honestly, qui est cette dame?"}
{"text":"Love the fried rice and broccoli beef. Pretty fast service as well. However their wifi connection sucks. Hope they can fix it soon."}
{"text":"Love the chicken fried rice on the spicy side.  The manager here at this location is awesome she runs a good crew. Stop by if you have a chance it's worth it."}
{"text":"for some reason i keep going back to this place because it's a great location but i've never been happy with it. the service is poor and rarely gets the order correct or forgets details. i added honey seated chicken to a side of life mein and the lo mein came with no sauce on it. just dry noodles. not what i asked for at all.

edit: even the fortune cookies are stale."}
{"text":"It is no secret that my girl and I like asian food so we thought we would try Pei Wei. Why did it take so long for us to get here? We both enjoy lettuce wraps and the ones here were some of the best we have had and both felt enough to mention it out loud. Sam had a poke salad and was amazed at how big a salad it was. I had chicken Thai dynamite, I was offered the option of brown rice so I took it. Big serving and just the right amount of spicy. We had such a great experience we came back the next day. This time I had Dan Dan noodles, again, big portion and I knocked it out, no take home for me. Dining room is clean and if you need anything, Dax is all over the place and will take care of you, exceptional staff all around. Pretty sure we will be in again soon, join us."}
{"text":"I was surprised to read any bad reviews about this tastefully decorated, well managed little PFChang rip off restaurant.  I thought the chicken lettuce wraps tasted exactly like PFChang! They were delicious.  The bowls you put together had fresh crispy vegetables served with perfectly prepared shrimp.  We loved it.

It was clean, tasty and relatively inexpensive.  If you go there off hours it is also quiet and they don't hurry you out.  Try it on Date Night."}
{"text":"The food is always tasty and hot, but this restaurant has had phone ordering issues for months and has done nothing to fix it. Most of the time you can't get through, same message keeps repeating. I made staff aware and they just shrugged it off, and nothing has been fixed for over 2 months. Online ordering is a mess too. Their website sometimes shuts down, and when it does work the wait for takeout can be up to 90 minutes. Again, this has been an issue for months with no solution. Clearly this Pei Wei needs to hire more people to support the volume, but it appears they have not. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I've been here about a million times over the past few years, but somehow never thought to write a review.  I really dig Pei Wei.  It is so much fresher tasting than typical Chinese take-out, and it is my go-to don't-want-to-cook-tonight place.  I love their online ordering (and iphone app) - it is quick, easy, and painless.

As far as the food goes, most everything is delish.  My personal fav is the crab wontons.  I'm seriously OBSESSED with these... they are nothing like the cream-cheese puffs found elsewhere, thank goodness!  They actually have CRAB in them!  I also like the orange chicken, thai curry, kung pao, and salads.  Not a huge fan of their pad thai, but there are so many other options that I hardly miss it.  I do miss the caramel chicken special... it was delicious, and I'm bummed it didn't make the permanent menu. 

Pei Wei is an example of a chain done right - clean, quick, consistent and tasty.  I'll be back - again and again and again."}
{"text":"Normally I like Pei Wei (it's the predictable \"faster food\" second channel of PF Chang, and the recipes are fresh, flavorful and fast.)  Unfortunately, this location kind of sucks.  Most of the tables in the place were either dirty or had been left half-bussed.  Clean plates and napkins weren't on the tables ready to go like they usually are at Pei Weis.  And my dinner companion for some reason got an entree that was about half the size of everyone else's.  Overall we just got the feeling it wasn't well managed.  Unless this location is within walking distance of your place, try the one on South Eastern Avenue going into Anthem - it's always clean and efficient."}
{"text":"This place is high end panda basically but id rather go to panda and that's something I wouldn't say ever but this place just isn't good. The food is okay nothing to brag about the portion is so small like very small after your done eating you'll want so much more because it just doesn't get you full and the pricing is just dumb.."}
{"text":"I'm the kind of guy who once I find something I like to eat at a particular place, I rarely deviate from it.  So with that in mind, the 3 things that I order are #1 spicy Korean with chicken and white rice,. #2 lo mein noodles with beef. #3 Mongolian beef with fried rice(#3 is my girlfriend's dish, but I like it). I have tried a few other dishes but they are just too salty or too heavily breaded . Loved the convenience of their automated system of remembering my previous orders based on my phone number! They just recently added an online ordering system and a loyalty card where you buy 10 en trees, you get the 11th free. Love the convenience, price, and taste of Pei Wei! I eat there so much a friend's little 4 year old girl calls me Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Tried the sushi for the first time today and it was way beyond what I expected! So delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day..had pad thai and 
Edemame.  Like everyone else says...a step above panda....i will go elsewhere for pad thai."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, 30 min to take out. The take out line was 10 people deep, and regular line was to the door. Understaffed, only 1 caisher, 1 handling takeout/online orders, and 1 server who also is doing the bussing. I was not given my CC receipt. I asked for light sauce and food is swimming in sauce making to salty."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for at least 5yrs. The quality of food and service has declined rapidly recently... 
Came in this evening for a quick bite. Food was greasy and bland. The biggest issue is how filthy the dining room is. Sitting next to the drink dispenser and can smell sewage/sulfur smell which is overpowering. The floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned in ages and the walls have old food and drinks on them. Thoroughly disgusted and couldn't finish food... 
Very disappointed and won't return!"}
{"text":"You know when you and your spouse end up taking SO long to figure out what to eat and you've been driving for a while and you're ready to eat your arm cause you're so hungry? Well that's the reason we ended up here! I actually wanted to go to the Applebee's a little more down the way but the hubby insisted we come here because \"it's been so long since he's had it.\" The menu lacks in variety and nothing looks appealing. We ended up ordering the Pei Wei Chicken, Dan Dan Noodles, Kids Lo Mein meal and a spicy tuna roll - everything came out to be just shy of 35 dollars. Pei Wei chicken was okay, nothing amazing about it. The rice was okay. The Dan Dan noodles was probably the best entree we ordered but in the grand scheme of things it's like a 6/10. My son enjoyed his Lo Mein but my son loves everything. The spicy tuna roll came up very short, you can honestly find better at a grocery store. The service was okay, it took 20 minutes to get the spicy tuna roll because they forgot about it. We probably won't be coming back here. 2 starts because it wasn't exactly horrible and the place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried this place for the first time yesterday.... what a mistake!
I had the Pad Thai with shrimp and steak, it was horrible!!!! the steak tasted like leather, the shrimp tasted like rubber balls of bland white fish. I will not go back, my wife's meal was horrid also...

An off night? don't know, but if it tastes like this all the time, they will not be in business much longer...
Guaranteed!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan. Coming from Orange County, CA, I have high expectations when it comes to Asian food.  Suffice to say that Panda Express would have been a better choice, which is pretty sad."}
{"text":"I'm already not crazy about PeiWei but I'm highly upset my online order didn't include fried rice that I paid extra for. Please stop moving so fast and ensure quality on orders! I don't like white rice which is why I PAID to upgrade to fried. Oh and no lids for the small cups for my child's kids meal so I drove home trying not to spill :)"}
{"text":"For a fast-casual restaruant, I am pleased with Pei Wei. It is very clean and the food always seems to be fresh.  I like the fact that they have a good selection of different styles of Asian dishes...whether you are in the mood for Pad Thai or Mandarin style Kung Pao Chicken.  The gluten free Vietnamese rolls are good here too. 

I have eaten in several times and the preparation of the food is pretty quick.  I have also picked up take-out, which can be ordered online or by phone.  If you are looking  for an inexpensive, fast, and convenient place with good quality, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Kung pao chicken is my favorite, got the crab wantons and they were very good. I ordered a head of time and the order was ready for pickup when I arrived. I have been to this location 2 times now and the chain more many times."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and reasonably priced. The atmosphere at this pei wei is really nice. There is nice artwork and scenery around. The drink dispenser is one of those cool touchscreens where you can select almost any drink you want."}
{"text":"Pei Wei the best thing to happen since PF's but since it is the same company that is understandable. The only thing would change is the number of locations....there needs to be more of them. Can't go wrong with Mongolian Beef and a side of crab wonton."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of my favorite lunch spots, this location specifically. The quality of the food is consistent and the service is generally pretty quick even during the busy lunch rush. The manager is very welcoming and makes it a point to ensure that customers are satisfied with their dining experience."}
{"text":"I told the manager (Kobe or Colby?) I didn't like the way they made the sweet and sour tofu here at Pei Wei after I ordered it. He apologized and hooked it up with 8 vegetable spring rolls, which was twice the price of what I ordered but he gave it to me at the same price as my original order. Great service here. The vegetable spring rolls were really good! Next time I wont order the tofu here cause they don't bread it like other chinese restaurants do. If they give me the vegetable spring rolls at this price every time I come here I'll be a frequent customer but if they expect me to pay almost 20 bucks for 8 of them then this is most likely my last time eating here since this is basically the only thing I would/could eat here. The service by the guy who I mentioned who I believe was the manager is the reason for the 5 stars. He made my visit go from a horrible experience to a great one in just a matter of seconds. Give that man a raise!!!

Pros
----- Amazing soda/beverages machine. I Have never seen anything like it before. It's digital and touch screen and has so many different options to choose from. I chose the vanilla cherry dr pepper which wasnt too good but I cant complain since I asked for a water and got soda instead.

----- Great customer service. If you don't like your meal they will be quick to change it to your liking and will even replace it for something more expensive at no additional cost (at least that was my experience)

----- Really good vegetable spring rolls and a great chilli sauce to dip them in. You will get addicted to them but the price isnt right for them. I wish they were cheaper so i guess this is a pro and a con.


Cons
----- Doesn't look or feel like a real chinese restaurant. None of the workers or cooks are chinese. They are pretty much all caucasian. 

----- The tofu is horrible. They dont know how to make the tofu the way every other chinese restaurant makes it. They need to start breading it and frying it the right way. 

----- Overpriced meals/appetizers. Over 9 bucks for 4 spring rolls is insane. 

----- They dont fry their vegetables even if you ask them to.

This place honestly didnt deserve 5 stars, maybe more like 2 or 3 at most and even that is being generous but the customer service was so good that I am giving it a 5."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is always great! My family and I go and get edamame and chicken lettuce wraps! Lines get extremely long around dinner time. Best to go earlier in the evening or after 7ish. Fairly priced also!"}
{"text":"So when someone says I want Lo mein vegetarian for my life long veggie kid, and I come back up and say this tastes like fish.. And they reply with \"oh next time order it with out oyster sauce that we add in.\" It's like I said I wanted Lo Mien made fucking vegetarian! 
I'm sorry I did not walk back to your kitchen and test every bottle of sauce at a lab to see its ingredients, and tell you what to leave out! If I order 3 vegetarian meals for my family on a lunch break it may be I don't want dead shit in our food. 
I took the untouched plate up and put it on the counter. 
They came back and offered to remake it. Sorry I have to get back to work... I don't have time to wait. Oh ok well next time order it with out the sauce we add in\" 
Next time what a fucking joke. Where's my refund for you getting my order wrong? Next time.. That's priceless. I have been here once before and I promise you I won't be back. 
Condescending arrogant staff, know your job. Or give me your pay check and I'll do it for you! 
Don't waste your time or money at this place. I'm sure their are a billion other places who will"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is always a great option when you are wanting some really flavorful Americanized Asian food and still want to eat healthy. It is basically a fast food version it's parent company P.F. Chang's and they do a great job of it.

Really like they way the menu is setup. You can pick your meats and the style of cooking as well as a tasty sauce to go with it. We have been here several times and always enjoy trying out the different specials that they are running.

All the cooking is done right in front of you in the open kitchen. It is fun to hear the sizzling of the meals as they are preparing them to perfection. Inside is also very casual and you can sit wherever you want. They even have a fun patio outside for when the weather is permitting.

We have tried most of the items that they serve and have not found one yet that we do not like. I usually go extra spicy with brown rice and then docter it up with more chili sauce to get my groove going. My wife likes to keep it a bit cooler and has a tendency to go on the mild side.

Service is alway very fast and friendly and the plates come out at lighting speed. Normally come here right before grocery shopping to avoid buying more food than we need.

I'm getting hungry just writing this review. Honey ... what do you want for dinner? Just might be time for some more Pei Wei. ORDER UP!

4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Great food and the place is pretty nice. My wife usually objects to doing Chinese food but when I talked her into trying this place she really liked it. The prices are a tad high for Chinese food but not too bad. Well worth it for the quality."}
{"text":"Horrible service waited over 40 minutes for so called fast food! Then manager on duty had the nerve to get attitude and tell me they were short handed! Then after the 45 minted my order was completely wrong! Will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"I go here once or twice per week. The food is great and good prices. A month ago I would have rated this location 5 stars without question, but recently the management/service side has been a disaster. No matter the time of day or day of the week, a dine in order takes 45 minutes. I started ordering take out ahead of time because of this and they never have it done by the time they say. The staff is friendly and says they're just short staffed but after a month, management needs to change something. Also, I have always ordered extra meat and lately they charge for it but never do it (see pic). I love Pei Wei but the wait times and such are becoming a deterrent."}
{"text":"I really like pei wei, even if they do have teeny-boppers manning the registers that overuse \"like\" and \"um, ok\".  I usually get the edamame and salad rolls, this is branching out for me.  my old favorite was the pad thai, no tofu, extra beef, extra spicy; with a side of crab puffs.  i am also a HUGE fan of their hot mustard.

service is usually expedient. it's not a big restaurant and can get a bit crowded."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of this place. There is something about the food that just doesn't do it for me. The crispy potstickers were kind of disappointing. They were too crisp but maybe that's a bias opinion since I love steamed dumplings much better. 

You get a choice of small or regular size for your meal. I chose regular and I must say, it was more than enough. I got a lunch the next day out of it. My pictures are both regular size meals and the crispy dumplings. 

They have that fancy fountain drink dispenser that is all electronic. You get to choose from many different drinks and even mix them if you like. 

For two regular meals, appetizer and one drink, the cost was around $28. The food was just okay but it was fast and enough to fill your belly."}
{"text":"Well, all the new commercials convinced me to try the Wei Better Orange Chicken. It is clearly better than Panda with that white meat and the $5 pricetag isn't too shabby either. For an extra buck, you can add veggies to the dish. The girl who was at the counter was really helpful and even gave me a free drink and a few cookies as an incentive to fill out the survey which I always do anyway. Any machine with Mello Yello on tap will always get my heart. Oh yeah, the food was even ready at exactly the time they told me to arrive."}
{"text":"Salty lattice wrap and kungpao beef. average food that tastes like a $6 buffet food quality."}
{"text":"Tried to order dinner but the store was out of tofu. REALLY???? An Asian restaurant should NEVER be out of tofu. Management needs to order product properly."}
{"text":"This place gets so much hype and so many people always suggest it for meals, but after hearing awful stories about roaches and hair I was reluctant to go back. 

Thankfully, my meal was insect and hair free, but there was absolutely nothing memorable about it. I had the crab won-tons which were virtually tasteless.. My Pad Thai the same, I had to load it up with lime and rooster sauce for there to be anything to wrap my tongue around. However, my friend had the Mandarin Kung Pao, and it was yummy. I ate more of that than my own meal. To me it is just quick chain food that I could easily buy in a frozen package and throw in my wok for about half the price. One thing I will say is that their staff is eerily friendly, and I don't know if it was my extremely enormous Asian inspired tattoo that they were mesmerized by, but I was asked how I was doing at least 10 times, by several different dining room attendants.. Ill give them that, and their orange tea.. I could drink that for days."}
{"text":"3stars because of slow service even during slow business. Was going to give 2 star but food was ok, so 3 is just enough. 3 stars was also because, not even the chefs calls for server knowing we are waiting for our food to be wrapped to go. Our food was waiting on the counter ready to wrap for to go order for 3min. I was so ready to wrap it my self or to say something but they were lucky their were group of familys with kids around the area so i didn't wanna be a bad sample to the kids. We are never going back again. And also one of the guys preparing the good was wearing gloves but scratches the side of his nose and I did tell him I saw that scratch, I would re do that food or ill say something and he made a new one. He is tall, a little chubby with facial hair. 08/20/17 at 7pm."}
{"text":"Love this place!  
This time we went, we went at Noon and were worried we'd run into a rush.  Nope.  We walked right up and ordered, no line.  And our food was out before we could get comfy in our seats!
The food quality is always good.  And the portions are always generous, I never finish and end up taking it home.  
The new Pork Sirracha lettuce wraps are AMAZING!
Place is always clean, people are friendly."}
{"text":"My kids like that they have the chopstick helpers, most places don't. 
My husband ordered the heavily advertised Carmel Chicken and was less than thrilled.  
The kids meals were big in size, but it was basically all rice.  Very little of the meat and sauce.  
I like it because it's fast, fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"This use to be a favorite Place for lunch and dinner.  
It's 1 pm lunch time I ask first if they could cool some of the heat off the dishes as I'm one that can't take a lot of heat.  Answer sorry no it is what it is. 
Ask for the import beer all that was there was bud lite in the ice.  
Answer sorry all we have is bud lite.  
It 1 in the afternoon on tues out of beer already 
Usually very helpful. Couldn't be bothered today hurry up order next 
Food arrives pretty good  taking our time nice lunch conversation. when the waiter with out asking picks up our plates to remove. Plates half full didn't even suggest a to go containers. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pei Wei, we have a love-hate relationship.  Which is funny, because I have the same relationship with PF Changs.  Coincidence?  Nope!  Pei Wei is the cheaper and faster version of its parent, PF Changs.

I've had quite a few things from Pei Wei and the follow are a few that I like: Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken or Shrimp Lo Mein, Edamame and the Crab Wontons.  My husband always orders the Mongolian Beef.

This food is not something that I crave or that I say \"Lets order from Pei Wei! Because its SO GOOD!\"  Rather, its one of those places that is like \"well... i dunno what I want for dinner, do you?  I guess we could do Pei Wei, since its cheap and fast and I reallllyyyyyyy don't feel like cooking.\"

What I do like- they are extremely fast and when you call to place your order, your number comes up in their caller ID, so they address you by name and ask if you would like the same order from last time (which they tell you what you ordered).  That would make ordering even faster!

We will continue to order from them when we want asian food for a good price."}
{"text":"Surprisingly enjoyed my lunch here the other day at Chang's little cousin. The food is freshly prepared and the prices are reasonable for the portions given. They had a General TSO's chicken special, which was just $5 for a huge portion. That dish had the a good kick, but nothing crazy. My sweet and sour chicken was terrific as well as it had very lightly battered white meat chicken in a subtle sweet and sour sour sauce with fresh and crisp vegetables. Both were served over a bed of white rice. The place was fairly crowded, but the food came out in normal time. We also tried those spring rolls which were like $3.50 for two and these were full of veggies and lightly fried. Only about $18 for lunch or less if you can resist the egg rolls."}
{"text":"I received excellent customer service from Jason at lunch today. He maintained a cool head under the pressure of the lunchtime rush. There was a question about my rewards membership and he was able to get me the answers I needed. His efficiency and pleasant demeanor made my lunchtime experience very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I will never be back - to any of them. 

I have lived in Las Vegas for over 7 years now and always wanted to try it (and PF Chang's - but now there's no need) and my husband kept telling me it wasn't that great so we never went.  

I should have listened. :( 

We went in, service was ok - nothing stellar and nothing horrid. The food, well. That left a lot to be desired. I ordered the spicy Korean with chicken. Yeah, there is NOTHING Korean about the flavor in that meal. There is also very minimal actual flavor. The portion size is decent, but that doesn't make a difference on a meal that has little to no taste aside from spice. 

I left half my meal because I couldn't fathom actually eating it again. 

We went next door to order my husband something from Jimmy John's (he was smart to pass up a meal at Pei Wei). We then went home and he ate his meal while mine ran it's course. Upset stomach for 3 days, never again. Ever."}
{"text":"Well Pei Wei in itself is awesome.. I enjoy the food. This review is for this particular location ONLY. My boyfriend and I eat Pei Wei 2-4 times a month. I live about a mile and a half away from the Dana Park location. We do take out every time and every time I get the same thing, orange peel steak. I do not like rice (yes, I know, I know) so I always order mine on the side and give it to someone else. So basically one time I picked up the order, rice was on the side but when I got home I noticed they must have messed up and initially mixed it with the meal because I had rice with my steak, but they scraped off as much as possible. I let it go, I was too lazy to get dressed, grab my keys and head out. Well it happened a second time and the more I thought about someone sitting there scraping rice off my food the more pissed I got. The manager was there, I told her what had happened and that this was the second occasion for this. She had them remake the steak and sent me on my merry little way. It is not my style to be rude when someone messes up but geez offer me a soda when I am sitting there, throw in a 20 percent off coupon for the next order, or comp the entree you messed up! I am not one who is looking for freebies or else I would have taken my food back the first time this happened. The managers non-apologetic, blah-zeh attitude about THEIR mistake left me with a bad taste. I will be traveling 3 miles out of my way to the other location from now on."}
{"text":"There used to be a Pei Wei very close to me on Lake Mead but unfortunately that location closed.  I actually preferred that location for a variety of reasons but I mourned my loss a short while since a fairly good Greek restaurant replaced it...which I will review sooner or later given that I've eaten there about twenty times.

ANYWAY, Pei Wei!
Go in, order, take a number, grab a seat along with your drink, and hot food is brought to you since everything is cooked nice and hot to order.  

The younger sister to PF. Chang's.  It has more of a pan-asian variety of Thai/Chinese then just straight Chinese cuisine compared Chang's.  The food comes in large portions, nice and hot with plenty of fortune cookies and delicious teas available.

I almost ALWAYS get the pad thai with extra chicken and tofu.  Their cooked tofu is really very good, very flavorful and it actually KEEPS very well in the fridge for a day.  

They are a PINCH pricier than I'd prefer, buuuuut.... c-est las vie.

I DID take AWAY a star though based on my first experience at this particular location where I stood waiting for my order to be taken while the cashier was going on and on to a server and then walked up without an apology or \"Oh, hello!  I'm sorry, I didn't see you there!\" or anything of the sort.  Or a friendly gesture or whathaveyou.  And when I mentioned this to the manager, (who is currently working there), I was given an apathetic apology from him and shooed away.  So no star for you."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out here recently.  3 entrees and chicken lettuce wraps.  Right after we got home, I got a phone call from the manager asking me to check my order. Unfortunately, we had ordered Kung Pao shrimp but were given Kung Pao Chicken instead.  The manager asked if we wanted to come back for the correct item.  It was pouring down rain, so we said we'd just eat the chicken.  The manager apologized multiple times, offered to refund us the money for the incorrect item, AND sent me a gift card for $10 a few days later!  Wow!!! I was super-impressed by the level of customer service and willingness to correct a small mistake (the first one we've experienced at this location).  
As always, the food was Delish!
Thank you, Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"I am a long term Pei Wei addict. Now that I live in Pine, we always go here when we are in the valley. We order sauce on the side and eat it when we get home. We have been doing this the last year. The last two times have not been good. We were given white rice instead of brown the visit before last. Relatively minor error, but this last order was awful. Gave me the wrong sauce for my dish and the chicken in both dishes was hard, dry and chewy. We couldn't eat it. I don't know but it seems this location is slipping. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I probably won't ever go to another one of theses restaurants I'd much rather go to an authentic Asian restaurant with cheaper prices and better quality food. This place is shit."}
{"text":"Okay corporate people, here is another example of \"I don't know why anyone gave this a 4-5 star review\" place.

Now if you have quick food on the go, and charge a fair amount for the items, at least try to make it not focused on hydrogenated oil and sugar and the cornerstone ingredients.

 So I tried the Mongolian.  Which is suppose to be beef with a barbecue sauce, with scallions and mushrooms.  Okay, how about over cooked beef, with a sugary sauce that was suppose to pass for a soy BBQ sauce.  Way to much sugar, way to much time cooking it.  

My fiancee had Ginger Broccoli which is in theory suppose to have broccoli with a sweet soy sauce, scallions and ginger.  One couldn't taste the ginger over the over sweet soy sauce (again the damn sugar and oil combo).  In terms of ginger, couldn't taste or see it and ditto for any other flavors except corn syrup with soy sauce to generously poured over much over cooked broccoli.

Pei Wei, take some notes from the playbook of other custom made to order fast food places and focus on freshness and wholesome ingredients.  You might have some repeat customers (now who in the heck would want that)."}
{"text":"God I love Pei Wei.

It's not the greatest and its certainly not the most authentic Asian food...but it is just so good.  I can't think of a time where I have ever turned down going to Pei Wei, whether it be for dining in or taking out.  It was one of the things I missed the most when I went to college out in CA, my visit's back to Scottsdale always had to include a trip to Pei Wei.

It's relatively cheap, quick, easy...and always tasty (& consistent).  They seem to add new things to their menu pretty often, and most everything they have is good.  I've probably tried nearly everything on the menu at some point over the years, but my fav's are probably Mandarin Kung Pao, Mongolian, or Honey Seared.  Oh and I ALWAYS have to get a side of Mongolian sauce for my rice...yum.

I'm getting a Pei Wei craving just thinkin' about it.  Sigh, I wish they were open late, like they most likely would be if this were a \"real\" city."}
{"text":"I like this in comparison to PF Changs.  Each dish is $5-$7 bucks cheaper and its set up like a take out or eat in.  Fast service and really good food.   Some of our favs are the Vietnamese chicken salad which is like an egg roll in rice paper.  If you have never tried them check it out.  Also love the Chicken Pad Thai and pretty much everything else they have for that matter."}

I visited the Henderson location for the first time on 1/4/18 (typically I go to the Summerlin Pei Wei) the customer service was just alright nothing spectacular. I ordered the sweet & sour chicken with brown rice. Wasn't the best sweet & sour chicken I've had nor the worst. HOWEVER, the next morning I felt very sick so much so that I had to leave work early. It's been 3 days and I'M STILL SICK (haven't eaten anything since). I've had food poisoning before and I know
for sure that it is food poisoning. I'm not sure if the chicken was under cooked or maybe the sweet & sour sauce was spoiled or a combination of the two. Whatever the case, I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. We don't eat out often, but when we do it's definitely a go-to for us. This was not a great visit for us. They have completely taken pot stickers off of the menu-much to the disappointment of my 7 year old. We ordered 3 kids meals and for each meal they hardly gave us any sauce. Needless to say, dinner was a bummer tonight."}
{"text":"Do we begrudge Pei Wei for being what it is?  The question of how many stars to give pei wei is a question of one's very theory of awarding stars.  is a fast-asian kitchen even worthy of five stars at its best?  could it ever live up to a mastros, or a houstons, or another restaurant of such ilk?

my perspective is that you must grade it for what it is, not what it never attempts to be.  And what it is is a great place to go to get a quick bite of very tasty asian food.  I have had many of their offerings and have rarely been disappointed.

spicy korean: delicious, with brown rice and extra veggies you might even consider it healthy.  mongolian beef, sweet, yet savory in that way that only mongolian beef can be.  and their kung pao chicken is spicy and flavorful.  is it groundbreaking?  no.  but I can go order it online and pick it up 9 minutes later and that is something that is worthy of mention.

also worthy of mention is some really delicious crab wontons and a very delightful rendition of sweet and sour sauce.  Probably the best crab wontons in the whole world--or at least this side of the prime meridian.  of course chinese ppl probably have no clue how to make *real* chinese food.

look, I am not saying that the pei wei's executive chef is gonna win any battles of kitchen stadium, but if you go to pei wei for that sort of thing then it's on you, knucklehead.  Quick, not too expensive, and very tasty."}
{"text":"I had chicken chow mein.  The chicken was dry.  The green beans were crunchy, I don't want my green beans to crunch.  The noodles were good.  The crab wontons filling was dry.  My husband enjoyed his General Tao meal."}
{"text":"While the food was flavorful it was unbalanced. The plate was full of rice with very little substance. It also left the supporting sauces. It also appears that the plate sizes have been reduced as well as the serving sizes. I was kind of disappointed"}
{"text":"Ok it is getting better but needs some work. They run out of stuff way too often. The food is consistent quality though."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the area, we tried Pei Wei and I tried their Vietnamese Noodle Salad. I'm addicted to it! It's so good, light, and spicy. Love it. I get it every time we go there. My husband has tried a number of dishes and they haven't been very good. They all seem kind of heavy and the pad thai sauce tasted like BBQ sauce to us. We have mixed feelings on the place because quite a few dishes haven't been that great."}
{"text":"We walked in for a quick pick up of dinner, but everyone was so nice and welcoming we decided to sit down. 

The restaurant was surprisingly clean, and with the amount of people in and out, it was awesome to see the attention to detail. Tables and booths were wiped and cleaned. The condiments station was organized and stocked! And even more impressive, the staff was high energy!! 

I run a restaurant in Scottsdale, and I would have this night compare with my restaurant, and I'm very proud of mine! Very high quality staff here!

But what added the cherry on top, we thought we ordered Spring Rolls, but noticed we didn't have it on our receipt so we didn't push anything, obviously, but Kevin, who was hustling all night, went over and above to get us some Spring Rolls. This truly invested in our experience here and we will be here more often! We live at The Muse on Central and McDowell, so we will be here more often. 

We appreciate this night so much!"}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and give this little place five stars because although it may seem overpriced for an 'order at the counter' place, the food quality is just as good as what you'd get at regular restaurant, just faster.

also, they have an entire menu of gluten-free items, or you can even say I'd like the Chicken Salad Spring Wrap gluten-free, and they know what you're talki ng about. Plus they have wine, and probably beer. AND i like their pad thai noodles and i even like the way they prepare their tofu, as george orwell would say, \"double plus good.\""}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. After a 20 minute wait, we got to the cashier.  The cashier was a young man who left the station to go bus tables because the restaurant was grossly understaffed. About five minutes later he came back took our order at 12:37.  At 1:10, We still were not served and ran out of time. I approached the kitchen area and asked about our food. It still had not been prepped.  We were completely out of time spending almost an hour they are now without any food. We had it boxed to go and ran late to our next appointment. It always Confuses me when a restaurant understaffs it's crew at the Customer's expense.  Needless to say Pei Wei is off my list for any future lunches!!"}
{"text":"Good good food !!!! Always hot and fresh ! Lettuce wraps are a must. Great service and great tasty food makes this one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei, hate this location. Everytime I come to this location for an order to go, it never seems to be right. Tonight I ordered shrimp and tofu Pad Thai to go and specifically asked when I grabbed my bag that it was shrimp and tofu and the guy said yes. I get home and there were 2 shrimp in the entire dish and NO tofu. The 2 shrimp were literally soggy and tasted like bisquick because of whatever batter they put them in and didn't cook for long enough. Along with that, the noodles were dry and flavorless, it was like no sauce was put on them at all. Very disappointed, won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Helpful staff with great recommendations!!! An all around great experience would definitely recommend to a friend. The cashier Sedona was helpful and made a swell recommendation. Overall a win for this pei wei can't wait to go make more amazing memories at this fine establishment."}
{"text":"What has happened to Pei Wei? My wife and like an occasional quick bite to eat and we like to stop by Pei Wei for the good food, good service, nice and friendly ambiance. Everything has gradually lowered to less than McDonalds service, facility, people.
To the point, store located at 1311 West Sunset Road, #120, Henderson, Nevada 89014 at 6:44PM on February 9th, 2011. The food smelled appetizing, and we placed our order. So far no problem, my wife proceeded to a table as I went to get straws, drinks, dinner wear like usual, but then no ice, no straws, no oranges, and two forks. I only needed two forks so that was good. I took what I was able to get back to the table and sat for a while, returning to get ice and drinks, still no ice, no straws, no oranges. Back to the table, I wanted to tell someone, I looked around and noticed a lot of discontent in the room, the person behind the cash register was playing with his hand held phone. One of the cooks had a heavy green wool jacket on, (what's with that). Finally the food was on its way, I noticed it as the young lady went to table to table to try to figure out who ordered the plate. Our number was 40, but it wasn't on the order so she had to hunt. We asked for extra sauce on our Mongolian Style, instead we received less. The mushrooms were cold. It has to be the management, the others in town are really top notch."}
{"text":"Ordered online, pick up was easy and on time. Of course when I get home, I'm missing two items. The person at the register looked like they checked my order. I guess my fault for not triple checking. SMH I'm not happy about this. My son and I were not impressed with what we ordered. Not planning on going back to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Mongolian beef is my favorite. Their sushi is great as well. I usually go for lunch. The bowls are decent sizes."}
{"text":"Went back to try one final time. Great customer service from a gentle named Davontae  I believe. Super personable, and engaging... they forgot the lettuce for my lettuce wraps, and my chopsticks... sigh... but food was way better than last time so... will try again. They need to get the kinks out, but seems an improvement over my last visit."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for Asian food. It's not great, but it's ok. It's on par with other middle-of-the-road chain restaurants. I enjoy some of the basic entrees here and appreciate its close proximity and ease of online ordering. When I've got a craving for Asian and am feeling lazy, this place works."}
{"text":"My dining experience today was fabulous! The Asian-fusion menu was fun and colorful to choose from. The parking was tight but the meal was worth it. Service was great and efficient. The food is worthy and cost about as much as Applebee's. I will return - Solid!"}
{"text":"I love this location. I know it's a \"test kitchen\" but I get the same meal everywhere I go. The staff are very nice and very helpful. I know this location is near their corporate office, so maybe that's why the restaurant is so clean, orderly and professional. My coworker and I eat at this Pei Wei location once a week for lunch; we LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei so much! Great employees and even better food... They have so many gluten free options and I always leave with left overs!"}
{"text":"Before I begin, I called the store before I decided to write this review. I ordered my meal (regular sweet and sour chicken) to go. When I got home, I see that my meal contains 7 small pieces of chicken. I call the store to express my anger (because I'm starving). The young women on the phone tells me that I am wrong. They \"weigh the chicken\" before they give it to me. I supposedly had 7 ounces of chicken in my bowl. There is no way my dinner contained 7 ounces. I've been eating the same meal for six years now, I know I'm not \"wrong\". With that being said, I will not be returning to the Summit Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of our favorites! That's partially due to the wonderful food but the management of this particular restaurant exceeds all others. The manager, Jimmy, knows how to keep his staff and patrons happy. We've been in on weekends and even on a Valentine's Day where the line was nearly out the door, but because this establishment runs such a tight ship, we have never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table on their busiest of nights. Highly recommend  their Honey Seared Chicken, Kung Pao and Mongolian Beef but it's the service that earns them this 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I ordered teriyaki chicken today, while eating my food I found a peanut in it, and I am highly allergic to nuts. I brought this to the attention of the manager Jess***, and was informed that I should have let them know that I have an allergy despite the fact that my dish doesn't come with nuts. AMAZING! I can't believe how little this women cared they could have killed someone."}
{"text":"I really love asian food. I mean all asian food, from hole in the wall places to chains like this. This location has treated me well and the food is always great. It is super close to my new office, and on the day of my interview I actually dined there in an off hour and it was very nice. From my experience, the cashiers are exceptionally thorough, the one who calls pot stickers \"POPstickers\" makes me giggle every time, and they know how to move some bodies. I've had the honey chicken with both white and brown rice, as well as the POPstickers- all delish"}
{"text":"Placed an order this evening on the website for a 5:10 pm pickup. Got there at 5:10 pm and gave girl my name twice to which she states that she doesn't have my order in her system. I proceed to show her my confirmation email and she tells me that they are having a lot of problems with there system and that I would need to step over to the main cashier and re order my food . I walk out of the restaurant and go home. Why would I place an order with this Pei Wei again online and take the risk of it not being there?They are very unlikely to see me as a customer again."}
{"text":"PeiWei is always a great, consistent choice.  Their food is unique and well prepared, and the restaurant is successful in being simultaneously casual and trendy. It's a perfect blend between cheap fast food chinese and upscale PF Chang quality."}
{"text":"Nice noodles! We tried the Bangkok noodles with peanut sauce. My hubby and I loved the balance of spicy, sweet and nutty sauce with the generous noodles. My son loved his sesame chicken noodles. The portions are generous. We did not go home hungry. We enjoy seeing the chefs cook the food. The one major negative was the fact that there were many used dishes that were left on tables and were not cleared the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"While eating lunch today, we noticed a worker dusting over the kitchen area. We looked and there were open food containers below. When confronted, neither she nor the man in the kitchen seemed to care. 
Wow.....really Pei Wei? Not good for business."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  Unfortunately, a simple
order turned into an hour wait.   Three people were ahead of my order.   As we waited the manager then started demanding our names, pointing at us in a rude and familiar manner, and then said \"you're going to be here for a while.\"   He then proceeded to bark orders at the young hard-working staff.  Excuse me?  It's amazing he treats customers and his employees this way. I left disgusted, and without my order."}
{"text":"Multiple bad experiences. Last time was undercooked chicken. Today it was cold egg rolls. The kind of cold you get when they're not cooked all the way. The replacement ones were not as cold. Still not right. I ordered and paid for extra chicken. It was the same amount as my wife's order. Not happy with this location."}
{"text":"We came in because of the commercial comparing it to Panda Express.  I don't even know where to start.  You barely get any chicken and a whole plate full of rice.  For $1 extra you could get veggies.  That was miniscule. Skimpy on chicken and veggies and too much rice.  When we showed them the chicken they said it was 7 ounces.  So they brought us an extra small bowl of chicken.  That was nice but let's move on to taste.  No flavor. Blah.  I meant to say bland but blah works too.  We were a party of four and we all agreed.  They got four of us in for a one time purchase but didn't convert any of us.  Panda Express is our favorite for orange chicken.  Sorry pei Wei but we gave you a fair chance."}
{"text":"Good food and super fast service. Even at it's busiest times, you can get in and out pretty quickly. Good for takeout and dine in.

Even though this is a chain, it's a great choice for Asian-style food."}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei! Affordable and delicious. Their lettuce wraps are always a hit, but my favorite dish is the Honey Seared Chicken w/ brown rice. I like that they are now offering 2 portion sizes, small and large, so you can decide how much you want. I'm not a big fan of leftovers so I get the smaller size, perfect for lunch. They do get quite busy and like most businesses have cut down with help. I now see the 'servers' cleaning the tables instead of bus people, not sure if that is a temporary or permanent change. 

They have one of those giant soda machines that dispenses 32893894 different kinds of soda. And I love those! Makes for a little bit of a line as everyone is going over their choices but I don't mind the wait. 

Fortune cookies are good. Food is good. Service is usually good, and food is very affordable. I'll probably go again for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service not so much.   We tried calling and ordering over the phone (the old fashioned way) as we prefer.   All we got was a recording that kept repeating, please hold, then it would ring and go back to recording, the recording recommends ordering online rather than waiting on hold.   I thought surely someone would pick up eventually and they never did.   I ended up ordering online (which I was trying to avoid) and it confirmed that  my order would be ready at a specific time.  We arrived 5 minutes  after the order was supposed to be ready.  The pick up line was backed up to crowded room of  people waiting for their order, pretty chaotic.   We finally got our order 20 minutes later.   It may have just been a bad night for the restaraunt but they should keep in mind that some of us \"older\" folks don't like jumping on the computer for everything and also not to promise a delivery time that they cannot fulfill."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pei Wei since they first opened. I ordered online last week and when I got home, I was seriously disappointed. I don't think I will eat there again. Not only have their portions become smaller recently, but the quality has gone down. When I picked up the food, I was in disbelief. My Pei Wei spicy was 3/4 full and the other dish was a little less.  I couldn't believe it. This franchise seems to be going in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Used the mobile app. My girlfriend went to pick it up. She paid and waited for 20 minutes before they told her they were out of the sauce for her dish and she needed to pick another one. She then waited another 20 minutes for the order and brought it home. My dish was cold and not what I ordered, we were missing the red sauce for the crab puffs, she didn't like her new dish, and they weren't willing to compensate us for the inconvenience. We used to eat her often, but they've gone downhill. I'm done with them."}
{"text":"I usually order take out here. Customer service is fast (separate cashier for take out) food portion is good and taste delish. It's a healthier alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"I usually place my order online and pickup when it's ready. Their food is delish, they have separate customer service register for take out orders that are fast and pretty friendly. Have not been disappoint in their quality or portion size of food. 
It's a great healthier alternative to fast food. 
Come in (or take out) and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Good food, but the wait time is ridiculous. I have a 30 minute lunch break I can't stand in line for 20 minutes just to order. A place this busy you'd figure they'd have a couple people on register, nope only 1."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the spicy chicken salad. I got the original size and it came with a VERY small amount of chicken and the rest mostly lettuce and rice straws.  See the picture I posted. Paid 8 bucks and still very hungry.  

I asked the server if this was the right amount of chicken.  He rudely said \"yeah they are all that way\". No offer to add more or even try to help. C'mon guys."}
{"text":"The entire chain has gone down. When they first introduced this concept- the food has flavor, ingredients were fresh & flavorful, and the staff was friendly. 

Nowadays, the Dan Dan noodle bowl taste like ramen noodles with a flavorless sauce and fried chicken. Even the paper napkins have been downgraded to cheap quality. 

Avoid this restaurant & chain at all costs!"}
{"text":"My Review For/Of Pei Wei
The Place Is Absolutely Amazingly Awesome Good/Great, The Menus For Getting Chinese Food Is Wonderful, The Restaurant Is All Clean/Nice Every Single Day, The Customer Service Here Is Top Notch & (And) If You Like Getting Chinese Food Then This Place Is For You."}
{"text":"Ordered online and waited over an hour to get food. This place is a complete mess. I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Even though I'm Asian and I've eaten quite a bit of Asian food in my life, I had to have a Caucasian co-worker explain to me the hierarchy of Americanized Asian cuisine. Top of the chain is PF Changs and the bottom of the barrel is Panda Express. Right in the middle, at a happy medium, is Pei Wei Asian Diner.

Affordable, tasty, probably loaded with MSG...but hey! Sometimes you got to have your Mongolian beef, orange chicken, and gigantic bowl of white rice. I've got to say I was very happy after my Pei Wei lunch. I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Bad experience today. It took 30 minutes to get our food. The food was not prepared as good as it usually is. Running late to the airport now. I hope management addresses the problem so this doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"Food is decent but whether we get take out or we dine in there is always something wrong with the order. We waited 45 minutes for drinks that never came, asked 3 different people along the way and none of the 3 were able to help."}
{"text":"C call the place in order to pick up on my way home was on hold 5 minutes or better with the recording saying I should order online. Decided not to order at all Nd go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Yuck, piles of trash swept up in the back between the drink machines and restrooms and just left there. And the food was mediocre. This location is always off in one way or another."}
{"text":"Always too busy with little staff.  Should have a separate place for postmates like they do with online and phone."}
{"text":"Long time customer of pei wei. This one by far is the worse location I've been to. Always SO slow and dirty. Staff Can't figure out how to use their digital coupons ever. A tipping point for me to write this review is going in on a Tuesday night waiting in line only for them to tell us they have no seats available and it's an HOUR wait to JUST GET YOUR FOOD. How does they even happen!? And 45 minutes to get take out. WTH get better cooks or a better system. Tried to get an answer from their district leadership and on social media only for not a single person to respond or contact me."}
{"text":"Sam took our order and she was super helpful. I explained exactly what I wanted and she made it happen."}
{"text":"First time trying this place because it was a highly recommended. I liked how they offered brown rice and their food are not greasy like some other Chinese food place. I ordered chicken pad thai, steak mongolian beef, spicy chicken, and kung pow chicken. My favorite is the steak mongolian beef"}
{"text":"Worst Pei Wei branch ever.  Service sucks big time.  I ordered for dine in and to go.. They served one entree took the number from the table even though the number is not yet completed.  My to go order was even worst.  Vietnamese spring rolls was not in the bag.  Manager came to give me the Vietnamese spring rolls but NO peanut sauce included.  I asked one of the waiters for the sauce and gave me one peanut sauce and one sweet chili sauce. Since when you use chili sauce for Vietnamese spring rolls?  Furthermore my order have three rolls, the sauce they gave is only good for one roll.  Lastly my to go chicken lettuce wrap order,  yeah it come with lettuce but they just chopped the lettuce and gave me a quarter part of it.  Yeah right How can I wrap the chicken with a quarter wedge of lettuce? WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS LOCATION EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! What happened to this place. Used to go here quite a bit but it's been a few years. Stopped in for dinner about 8pm tonight. The dining room was filthy, floors greasy, chairs and benches covered in food debris. The whole place felt and smelled like it was covered with a layer of grease. The utensil containers were basically empty, however, there were a few forks but the bottom of the container was so disgusting and the fork tines were sitting in it so I opted for chopsticks. These containers obviously don't get washed.  On the way back from the bathroom I looked into the kitchen.  I've never seen a kitchen so bad. And the cooking area had so much grease on the floor, you could see footsteps as the cooks moved around. Not to mention all the food on the floor. The food was more disgusting than the restaurant. The orange beef was so over cooked that it was more like potato chips but yet it was cold. The rice was cold and had a peculiar smell, like it had been scorched. The extra veggies we added to one dish were raw and cold, like they were thrown on top at the last minute. I will never go back. A complete disaster!"}
{"text":"Went in and there were 2 customers in the store. It still took them 30 mintues to give me my small order of an entree and sushi. I had to get up and stand by the togo area to get them to realize my food had been sitting there all along. They cleared my order off of their screen and forgot about it. Got a refund and am not going back. The sushi was sitting out for the entire time and they expected me to take it. Disgusting."}
{"text":"i tried the thai river noodles. they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl. but the thai noodles, they were good.

i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here. and the food in inconsistent. oh also, the new soda machines are very entertaining. just watch....

this is usually a last resort option (everything else in the area is closed). but it is a good one nonetheless."}
{"text":"I received a coupon from Pei Wei yesterday for 33% off of Rice, Noodle and Salad Bowls. I gave the coupon to the cashier before placing the order. When the order was rung up, it wasn't giving me the correct discount. The cashier argued with me at first that I was receiving the discount, but the math wasn't adding up. The items on the ticket matched the coupon and, it wasn't working. She asked if she should go to the manager, and I said yes. I was only coming to Pei Wei today because of the 33% off. That's a great discount! 

The manager was very snotty about the situation. He refused to come to speak with me and kept saying, \"I have no control over that. I don't issue the coupons. Corporate does.\" He said that 3 times. Then, he said, \"if you want to give her a 25% discount, do it\". I had a coupon that stated I should receive 33% off. The cashier came back and repeated what he said and said \"I can give you a 25% discount, if you want\". Why in the world would I want a 25% discount if I have a coupon from Pei Wei offering 33% off? I told them to cancel my order and I won't be back. The manager's attitude was appalling! If corporate Pei Wei offers 33% off, you are still responsible to honor it. The coupon didn't say, \"well, hey, if the manager of a Pei Wei doesn't issue the coupon and corporate does, be prepared for 25% off.\" It said 33% off!

There was a way that the manager could have handled this correctly. He could have offered something that made up the difference like a free little appetizer or anything, but he made no attempt to fix the issue and acted very exasperated as if I should be ashamed of myself for expecting them to honor the coupon. Seriously??? 

I've been a customer of Pei Wei for more than a decade. I WILL NOT BE BACK. This was some of the worst customer service I have ever received. The manager really needs to learn customer service and maybe take some anger management classes."}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei as I always know what to expect. However, this is the second time that I have placed a to go order and waited double the time I was told over the phone. This time I was told the order would take 15 minutes over the phone and I waited over 30 minutes. I would have received the food faster had I dined in. I saw multiple people arrive after me after who dined in. They were eating or leaving as I was barely getting my to go order. I had a simple order of fried rice, chicken Pei Wei, and California rolls.  I'm appalled!!! I didn't even receive an apology. When I asked why I waited so long I was told a cook was missing. If that were the case then those who arrived after me that dined in should still be waiting and not leaving, as I barely received my food!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a simple 8 piece spicy tuna roll take out one night and it was absolutely horrible and rushed. The quality wasn't very good and there was too much blocky rice to even taste anything else. Definitely don't get sushi from here"}
{"text":"Oooh, not good for Pei Wei that I can't remember what I ate here. It wasn't even that long ago...3 weeks? I have to say, I'm OVER all these places where you place your order and then go sit down. If the server has to come over to my table anyway, why can't he/she make that first effort? It is also awkward because do I leave a tip? I honestly cannot figure it out. 

Anyway, getting through the line was quick and effortless, though trying to carry 2 water glasses, two beer glasses, a huge sapporo and my table number was not thrilling. I remember rice...tofu...a few vegetables. It was spicy. there was no broccoli. Meh, it was decent, it ended up being big enough for two meals and it was relatively cheap. I'd probably go back, but I'm not sure why."}
{"text":"This place is consistent. 
Nothing earth shattering about their menu. 

I tend to order the honey chicken every single time. 

They like to give me white rice, even though I always ask for brown. 
They are always busy around lunch, and they don't seem to have enough bussers to keep up with the turn over. 

The fortune cookies are always stale. 

I do like that they have oranges available for the iced tea."}
{"text":"Good value, good location, good prices. But whoa!! you guys in the kitchen ... take it easy on the sugar! I do have a sweet tooth, but I prefer to have my sugar in my desserts, not in my entrees! I've eaten here many times, mainly because my swim team comes here often after evening swim practice, and I've ordered different things each time. And almost every dish I ordered seemed to have sugar as one of the main ingredients. I guess they figure that's what the American palate expects in food, even Asian food."}
{"text":"This was the worst Pei Wei I have ever had.  My food tasted as though it was burned.  I was on the phone with my friend in Arkansas as I ordered my food. Orange chicken nasty, Dynamite Shrimp nasty. Not good at all. I was very disappointed because I drove such a long way to get the food I knew would not disappoint. Foul Pei Wei......"}
{"text":"Walked in today with a friend to get a pick up order at around 11 am. Worst mistake ever. Cooks were looking at us right when we walked in and talking to the others around them and laughing as if we did something hilarious . I did not like this at all. It made my friend and I feel uncomfortable and you can tell that they were looking right at us because no one else was around nearby. I find this really disrespectful. Peiwei needs to hire more mature people in the kitchen. I will never ever come here again . I rather take my money else where."}
{"text":"First off,the staff is friendly and it is a relatively clean establishment. Now for the two stars, I have gone there on three different occasions where I ordered take out. Not once have they gotten my order correct. I hate being the guy that looks at every single item right after they pack it up, but if I go there in the future that is what I need to do.

Also, the sequence of preparation is wrong by personal and restaurant standards. On two different occasions they made my raw tuna appetizer and let it sit in the window for at least 10 minutes while the entrees were being prepared. 

Who wants warm raw tuna? 

Hopefully they address these issues."}
{"text":"That was horrible! The \"food\" is pure sugar. I could only eat two bits  (I have no idea why I had the second one). it was so sweet I can already feel cavities forming. The best $10 i ever wasted was leaving my plate full and walking out. Never again leason learned"}
{"text":"This is a great go-to place for a quick eat. We usually try to hit it when it isn't busy, no line or use the app to order. Since they are so busy, the seating area is usually busy. The employees are quick to clean up and are very nice. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for Asian food! It was very slow, but the nice waiters made up for the time waited. Also, it was slow because two of their kitchen staff walked out. There was also a long line that could have been moved quicker."}
{"text":"They charge more here than other pei wei locations, they don't have shrimp, and no rewards either. $18 for a meal and drink? No thanks. Next!"}
{"text":"Fast great food. Amazing friendly staff. Delicious cookies! Will return and recommend."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I had Pei Wei. Found this near my hotel and it fit the need. 
It's open floor plan and open kitchen and loud music was noticed upon entering. Menu now has sushi and poke and Vietnamese rolls. Couple sizes of entrees. Quick menu study and was greeted warmly by the one of the managers (Chris). Noticeably willing to make the customer experience good. Selected Kung pao small bowl. Vietnamese rolls with peanut sauce and a spicy Chili sauce and a glass of Chardonnay.  All for $19.73. Not bad. 
Rolls were very good. The wrapper fresh. The ingredients nicely rolled. Started with those. Then the King pao and brown rice. Nice size bowl. Nice flavor. Some veggies. Nice white meat. Cooked to order. Many steps above a Panda Express. Comfortable seating both in and out. Chris checked to see if I liked the food. Nice touch. 
Good quality, healthy options."}
{"text":"This is my third visit at Pei Wei but first time at this location. My fiancé and I can here for his birthday lunch. We ordered our food, and was looking for a table but all the tables we came across were dirty and had stains on them. 

My fiancé ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and a pork egg roll, and I got the Pad Thai with shrimp and veggies. Pad Thai and the lettuce wraps were eatable. The sauce for the noodles were too vinegary. Pork egg roll filling had no flavor, and it was too doughy and salty. The sweetness and the sourness of the egg roll sauce did not have the right balance. Lastly, the sodas did not have the right amount of carbonation or was lacking the syrup. 

Will not ever go back. I rather have Panda Express."}
{"text":"Haven't  been here in 4years wanted some thing quick.  Ordered chicken low me in.   Hi hen pieces were different sizes Nd were salty.  Portions were good size but the dish was very oily. It took 15 minutes  to get my meal don't think that I will be back any time soon.maybe 4 more years"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a staple in my family. We order from this location at least twice a month. No disappointments here.  Last time I stopped by, I ate at the bar since I was alone and I was offered more food for free. Yay!"}
{"text":"We have attempted to eat three times in the last three months. Two times we ordered for pick up and got there at the scheduled pick up time. The first time they told us there was an additional 40 minute wait. The second time they improved to only an additional 30 minute wait. We tried to dine in tonight. They said an order for two would take 30 minutes. That's ridiculous. I'm done."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna salad is very good, just put the dressing on yourself. Chicken friend rice is always spot on too! The only thing I notice is take out seems like more food"}
{"text":"I really like this particular Pei Wei as it easy to get into and I find it isn't as busy as the other locations.  I typically order the Honey Seared Chicken and it's always fantastic though they could cut the rice in half and give me another piece of chicken, as I always throw about 3/4 of the rice away, it's just too much.  My only reason for the 4 star instead of a 5 star?  When you're sitting at the tables it's like being in a wind tunnel, the last two times I've been in it was chilly outside and I FROZE in there.  I have witnessed many people picking a table and then having to get up and move to another spot when someone leaves as the \"warm\" tables are always taken when you go in."}
{"text":"Fast and fresh made wok dishes. You can customize and add variety of veggies. Sushi seems like its already pre-made don't recommend for the price and size."}
{"text":"Great staff 
Always clean 
Great family atmosphere 
Food is always amazing! 
Been coming to this location for 10 years. Will continue to come back! 
Thx so much!!"}
{"text":"Love the people and service from this place. Always busy when I go in, but never much of a wait to get/order food. Since the new rewards program started, I order online and just go to pick it up. I have it timed perfectly to walk in just as my food is ready for pickup. Great to know places still stay consistent in these times.

Also just got my free entree meal from my rewards, awesome!"}
{"text":"Did a carry out last night...I orderd Chopped salad, Thai Dynamite and Spicy Korean..flavours where amazing and I found the dishes very different then other Asian places...in a good way...we quite often get chinese delivered for dinner and for a change found this place much much better then other Asian places around summerlin area."}
{"text":"If mediocrity is what you strive for then you are in the right place!! I've dined at this location on numerous occasions for years as in more than a bakers' dozen... strangely the quality and level of service has diminished as quickly as our hope for our great nation. Then again they don't serve the sea bass that's offered at their Parent concept P.F. Chang's maybe because they forgot to see thing in black & white like the Salt n Pepper prawns?"}
{"text":"The food isn't greasy and they have a nice selection on their menu. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, edamame and Mongolian steak. I thought it was just as good of quality as something I would order from PF Chang's. Flavorful, clean and fairly priced. 

There are ads for Pei Wei's sushi all along the terminal, so I was a bit disappointed when fridge only had one $13 container of sad spicy tuna roll. The rice looked dry and the fish was brownish. 

My food came out in less than 15 minutes. I was very happy with the service and the food. I'm glad I chose Pei Wei's over the other food options in terminal 3."}
{"text":"Recently, my family and I ventured to this location for lunch. We've always enjoyed their location off the 101, and since we were in the area and hadn't been to this one before, we figured we'd give it a go. My god, do I regret that we did.
So we go in and all of us know what we want already. We're the only people in line and my mom begins by explaining that her order is to go, but the rest are for dine in and she would like it all on one check. Our cashier, Stella, completely ignores this and goes about taking my mother's order like we are in some fast food joint. Then, when my mom clarifies with her that she wants noodles with her entree instead of the suggested white or brown rice, Stella's already somewhat rude tone turns incredibly snippy and abrasive, acting like it's a ridiculous request and that it was stupid to ask. Further showing she ignored what was said before, she suddenly totals out the one order without taking the rest of ours as if she's in a hurry. Keep in mind, we are a party of four, and the only people in line. The restaurant wasn't even busy for a lunch hour during a work week, so there was again no reason to rush. She proceeded to be rude and snippy with the rest of us. When she totaled out the order, she also made it to where all of our entrees were to go instead of just my mom's. Even if you can't input it on the system, how hard is it to let the cooks know that only one order on a ticket is to go? My father then went and tried to correct the situation and asked for a table number, but she just shooed him off and said they would all just have to come out to go.
After we picked up our orders from the counter and sat down, I noted that she kept looking over at us and gossiping with her coworker, all flabbergasted facial expressions and gestures.
As someone who has worked in customer service, that is absolutely ridiculous behavior. Not just as an employee but for a grown woman to treat complete strangers, two of whom are senior citizens, as rudely as she did. Makes complete sense why for a week day when every other restaurant in the area is packed for this one to not even be half full. If this is the kind of \"customer service\" they offer, no thanks. Why pay $40 for horrible service and lukewarm food? I'll take my business elsewhere, as Stella clearly wasn't interested in having ours."}
{"text":"Excellent food,fast, a fraction of the cost of PF Changs.  Will order again for take out Friday night."}
{"text":"The manager and staff here are so nice. There was this one time thou that we were waiting for take out and this couple that appeared to be in their 20's was making out in the corner while they waited for their food. I wanted to barf and no one told them to stop so that the rest of us didn't loose it. Who does that in a public in a restaurant? :s 

Anyway. The first time I came here I got the beef and broccoli and hated it, but now I always get the crispy honey chicken and always leave satisfied. Not authentic but I wasn't expecting it to be.

And one time the manager have us a $10 gift card because the guy sitting next to us was acting like a complete jerk."}
{"text":"Bought the california roll. 9 pieces for less than $7 and yummy. Will definitely be coming back on my lunch breaks when i work in this concourse again."}
{"text":"gotta try the carmel chicken just once, its bomb! 

I don't have any major complaints but the interior was really big and spacious, I was sort of surprised by this. The amount of food you get for the price is good , I don't think it was price unreasonably at all. 

Oh props for their drink machines they have over 107 different flavors of beverages. LOL 

4 STARS"}
{"text":"Just place a take out order and when I got home there where no sauces for any of my appetizers( have you ever eaten a crab wonton without any sauce...not very good). If that wasn't bad enough when I called to talk to someone I was on hold for over 10 minuets! I see why they keep get bad reviews recently. Hey Pei Wei wake up and look at your reviews on line!"}
{"text":"The building is very much an improvement for the neighborhood. It looks good but one might have a hard time finding parking during high hours. It did not take long to get our order taken by a gently speaking man. We each ordered a different dish and we all enjoyed that which we ate. I never mind if food fits or not a particular set thought, such as being Asian. If it is good is all that matters to me, it was all very fresh and well presented. So once again I had a very pleasant lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a family favorite, especially for take out. I can call Pei Wei while I leave the house, order my food as I drive, and when I arrive 9 times out of 10 the food is hot and ready to roll. The food is always tasty and at a fair price. We love it."}
{"text":"We've always loved PeiWei, and were excited when we visited last week and saw that they had completely remodeled and revamped their menu. I love that they now offer small size portions, as we like to order appetizers and the regular portions were always too large. But several things have gone downhill since their renovation. The tables were mostly empty when we visited, but they were all covered in plates and leftover food. It took nearly 10 minutes to track someone down to wipe down a table. When our food arrived, my husband and son were confused at the size, thinking they had accidentally ordered a small, as their plates were full of rice with a sad side of meat. It now feels like more of a fast food restaurant without the plastic dishes, versus the old PeiWei that seemed like a great balance between take out and sit down. I think next time we'll take the kids to panda instead and head to PF'S for date night."}
{"text":"This is the last time we will waste money here. Skimpy portion with two pieces of steak and three shrimp on a noodle entree. Maybe they need a manager change for the umpteenth time."}
{"text":"I haven't had much luck at this Pei Wei location. Chinese food is supposed to be a great option for vegetarians, but Pei Wei seems to miss the mark. The tofu is over fried and had a fishy taste to me. The fish flavor was so overpowering that I couldn't manage more than a few bites. The sauce on the Tofu Lettuce Wraps is amazing (full of savory flavor) and even that couldn't save the tofu. The second time I went in for a special/seasonal dish advertised on their website, but couldn't find it on the electronic menus inside the restaurant. I remembered it had the word \"Thai\" in it so I ordered a Vegetable Thai Dynamite, and it was a huge disappointment. The dish is described as having \"Sriracha chile soy sauce, lime, scallions, red bell peppers, carrots, Thai basil\" so I was expecting something with pow but it fell flat. The sauce was weirdly only sweet and sour at the same time (but not like sweet and sour sauce, which I like), with no hints of chile or basil."}
{"text":"totts asian diner in the same complex kicks their ass any day of the week. i think i'm just not a pei wei person. it's like PF Chang's sister....on welfare."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is set up like a Panera. You order at the front, get your own drink and then take a seat and they bring your food to you. One thing that always gets a plus in my book is the access to lemons for my water. I came here at an odd time of day (like 3 pm) so it was almost totally empty inside. Great for ordering! No line to wait in and the food came out really quick! We had a 4 piece appetizer of the California mango sushi and it was REALLY GOOD! I will definitely be coming back for that! I had the broccoli ginger rice bowl with chicken. It was really good but you can definitely tell it's a chain restaurant by the way the food looks and is served. They had a ton of options from bowls to salads to entrees. Next time I come back I need to try some of their edamame and their crab Rangoon. I'm a sucker for both of those so I was happy to see them as a part of their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the Dan Dan noodles. Not bad! Especially when you have a pei wei reward. I like how you can order food to go and pick it up and the pick up station. The perfect meal to eat on the go."}
{"text":"I went there 5/2/18.  I had the orange chicken special....lots of rice not much chicken.  The brown rice was good the chicken what you got of it wasn't very good, lots of breading.  Wasn't very clean.....there was a pigeon sitting in a bowl outside on a table eating.  There was a grackle sitting on a plate eating.  Not one person was cleaning the tables, disgusting.  The bathroom doors were filthy."}
{"text":"Probably the best all-around every-day restaurant in Phoenix. It offers all 4 points: good food, great price, healthy choices, and fast service. 

And for those of us who live in downtown Phoenix...We finally have a place that stays open more than 20 hours a week! Thank you God, for giving us Pei Wei! 

And to all those other establishments in the downtown area that are only open Monday - Friday 11am-3pm, let Pei Wei be an example to you. There are people living down here, and we will come out and eat at restaurants that offer good food at good prices and stay open!!!"}
{"text":"On my first visit several years ago I was pretty psyched that a gluten free menu was available. And in fact, the gluten free options I tried were pretty good. Here it is years later and I am handed the same 4X6 wrinkled up, tired gluten free menu. Meanwhile I have watched new selections like the wok bowl and seasonal items come and go on the main menu. I did order the asian chopped salad and it was a flavorless bowl of lettuce with some shredded carrots and tomatoes. Oh! And a blob of plain shredded chicken sat in the middle of the bowl. C'mon Pei Wei! Gluten free asian fusion is not difficult. Almost all of the recipes except the deep fried options can be made gluten free with Gluten Free Soy Sauce. Probably will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Very bad experience treated very poorly..did not appreciate the customer service maybe take a few more lessons"}
{"text":"I know I have reviewed this location before. However, I do really like it. So here is another one. It seems that they have fully redone all their Staff. OK that is why they were closed for awhile. 
Anyway, we got a great coupon for and entree. So I called in the order for pick up. When I got there I added on the Crab Puffs. We have always really liked them here, they sure seem like they have real crab in them. So there you go.
This time around we ordered Kung Pao chicken which was very good, with lovely crisp snow peas. As well as Sweet and Sour Chicken several sauses on the side.
It was hot and fresh. Very good as always.
We were extra Greatful for the coupon as well.
Everything is still nice and clean inside. But, I took it to go."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at this location in particular, but in general the prices are high for what you get.  It's nothing special and any other Chinese place in the city can probably beat it in the price/quality area."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Scottsdale and get a hankering for Chinese food, I have to admit that Pei Wei is not my first choice. But after a long day, stopping here was much quicker than my usual spot. We ordered three dishes for four hungry people it was more than enough. I loved the short grain brown rice included with the ginger chicken and the tasty fried rice paired with the Mongolian beef perfectly. I'm not a fan of tofu so we substituted chicken in the Pad Thai dish. So good! Time to consume the leftovers!"}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. I am not one to leave negative reviews but if I can save someone any of the trouble that this place consistently gives me, then it will be worth it. After multiple attempts at giving this place, \"a Second try\" I am officially done. Whenever we call in an order it takes over an HOUR longer than the given estimated time, they get our orders WRONG, and just to add insult to injury, the tables in the dining room are always a mess and the bathrooms are disgusting. Despite being given a refund for our ridiculously long wait, which was a nice thing to do, it's not enough to warrant my return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh and quick for take out! Love that they are dog friendly on the patio. The scenery is beautiful at night, one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Pei Wie out of this world. Chop Chicken Salad....best!"}
{"text":"My (usual) order is saved so they just have to confirm my fave to go dish when I call in. My only minor complaint is that paying for my meal once I arrive is always a little disjointed if only one person is attending the cashiers. Priority seems to be to clear the dine in line before checking out the to go line."}
{"text":"I had the bright idea to stop by and place a to-go order one week day. Crazy busy!! I waited a while for my order, but I took it as an opportunity to meet others that were waiting too. The staff was very polite despite the chaos.  The food was fresh and savory!"}
{"text":"As the discount little brother of PF Changs I think they do a pretty good job on getting a few meal choices out to the table hot in a timely manner.
Although since the expansion of their menu and addition of about 15 new items I feel quality has suffered. 
(The Thai cream coconut sauce is like cream O mushroom soup from a can)
But as stated above the expectation should be of that inline with Panda Express as the price range is fairly close to that mark.

The higher percentage of their rice and noodle bowls are a good value and are served hot and fast. They have some kids items now as well.

Its decent Asian \"fast\" cuisine and they do have some healthy options which rewards them an additional star.
Just set your expectations accordingly and PW will be a good lunch dining experience."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend one day while on this side of town. We were both famished and ordered it to go so we could sit outside with our puppy. We started with beers, which came with an icy cold glass- a nice touch. Beers were $3.50-4 a bottle, which is fairly reasonable. The restaurant has a quick turn over and fills up quickly. It's interesting being able to see the cooking going on in the background, though it feels awkward standing around waiting for your order. It's essentially a chipotle for asian food but a little fancier looking. I ordered the chile ramen with beef- essentially a lot of msg-laden egg noodles [like pancit] in a ponzu-mirin sauce with a little bit of beef and a few vegetables. It wasn't what I had anticipated and while it filled my gaping belly, wasn't something I'd ever order again. There was hardly any beef and the whole package was essentially stuffed with noodles, a super cheap ingredient. My boyfriend got a chicken dish that was recommended by the hostess but it had very little chicken, no veggies and tons of rice. Maybe it was because we ordered it to go...I'd eaten at other Pei Wei locations in town but it had been years ago, and the experience hadn't excited me enough then to draw me back over. I'd rather spend my money somewhere else and get a delicious meal as opposed to a wimpy one."}
{"text":"I didn't think that I could eat Vegan here but actually it's possible. Great service, and actually our cashier was vegetarian so she really helped out. Ended up getting the veggie pad Thai, veggie spring rolls, and the pei wei veggies with tofu and rice. Everything was great. Lots of food! They have some beer and wine selections. Will go back. Suggestion: Please add more vegan options."}
{"text":"Yet another example of a restaurant chain that has been crapped out of the back end of corporate America.  I went to this place because a couple of friends... preppy white boring friends... recommended it.  I should have known I would hate it.  

First, I walk in thinking it would at least be sit down, but no... it's a fast food.  You have to go to the counter.  I guess the new terminology that folks are using in order to convince white yuppies with money is 'fast casual.'  Not fast food - fast casual.  I guess the difference is that they bring the food to your table.  Well, isn't that a fancy cup of hot tea.

And then there's the menu, which bring up the question.  What do you get when you cross a Panda Express with another Panda Express?  You get this craphole called Pei Wei, at twice the price.  

And how do you pronounce it?  PeeWee?  Is that supposed to be cute?  Hello Kitty, meet average corporate Asian dump.

But what bugs me the most is I saw what type of clientele this place attracted.  The same folks who would scream at forking over an extra buck at a locally owned Asian restaurant are giving away the bank for bland, typical, run of the mill food that you could find at your local Dennys.  White people just piss me off... and I can say that because I'm white.  

You didn't see Asians in there.  You didn't see any Latinos, and you certainly didn't see any Black folk.  All you saw were a bunch of white preptards that would fit in nicely at a Jeff Foxworthy concert.  \"You know your a redneck when... you eat at Pei Wei Asian dinner and you really think you are getting a taste of real Asian culture.  Hell yeah!\"

I know how you are, thinking that you are going to teach your kids what real Asians eat and in a environment that is true to the Asian culture and you'll show your little snot head kids how to eat with chopsticks so they can learn to become the brain dead pretentious adults that their parents have become but in fact they know just as much about true culture as a plastic fork.

Well, that's how I saw the whole thing.  Parking was good."}
{"text":"We have had it with this location.  One of the most inconsistent restaurants we have ever been to.  As for service forget it, it sucks at best.  You order a salad, regular and they give you a small one but at the price of the big one.  We complained to the one waitress in the place and she said \"sorry about that\" and walked away.  AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COST!  They just don't care."}
{"text":"The past several visits have been less than acceptable.  Items are missing,  like the lettuce for lettuce wraps or sauces. The pad Thai sauce was runny and last night the LoMein was tasteless and the chicken dry and overcooked.  I was not asked if I wanted fried or velvet stock chicken. This chicken was inedible.  The Vietnamese chicken rolls were good, and would have been great if the sauce was included.  Is it just this location or are all locations faltering?"}
{"text":"Great take out. Wide variety of things on menus. Will work with you on what ever you like."}
{"text":"Great menus selection. Nice people. Had A lunch meeting. Very professional. Clean restrooms   Staff nice."}
{"text":"Worst lunch ever.  Thai chicken lettuce wrap tasteless,  pei wei spicy was horrible with undercooked fried rice.  Barely touched my lunch"}
{"text":"There's been a few noticeable changes here since my last visit to Pei Wei. First, they replaced the long menu board near the entrance to a smaller and easier to read electronic menu screen. Some menu items such as the combos have been removed and some new items have been added, mostly appetizers and salads. Simply choose your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, or tofu), size (small or large entree),  then your sauce, and then type of rice or noodle (white, brown, fried, etc). I don't come here much and I always forget what I got last time, so I just choose what sounds good. I've had all different entrees here and seem to usually go with Pei Wei spicy, orange peel, sesame or spicy Korean. This time around I decided to try sweet and sour chicken with a cup of Thai wonton soup. The wonton soup is nice and light, and the sweet and sour chicken was good but they tend to oversauce their entrees so if you're sensitive to that, be sure to tell them when ordering. The small entree size was perfect and I typically have a hard time finishing a large size, but it's only 2 bucks more.

They also removed the old skool soda fountain and installed a Coca Cola Freestyle machine on one side of the self service counter and a water/ice machine on the other side. The seating is all the same and if you're dining in, you simply grab your seat after grabbing your drinks and they'll bring your order out to you when it's ready, which isn't very long and they'll pick up your empty plates when you're done. Silverware, boxes, drinks, sauces and fortune cookies are all self service here.

I would recommend this place when you're looking for a fast casual Asian fusion meal. The food here is better than places like Panda Express and a lot fresher but the menu items are fairly similar."}
{"text":"Just ok for my first try. It was clean, organized and the staff were great. I got the spicy chicken bowl.  I have to make a disclaimer, I love and have eaten Asian food all over the world, so I have pretty high expectations.  If it's not authentic I'll know it right away. Having said that, this is a chain restaurant.  It's portioned for profit, just enough and no more.  My meal tasted like it could have come frozen from a bag. Sauce pre-made probably bottled.  Pretty nice taste overall. I opted for fresh veg' instead of rice, they were fresh cut and very nice.  It was good honest food prepared fresh when I was ready for it. I'm always going to give credit to those people who take a risk and open a biz."}
{"text":"A salty tasteless experience.  Ordered the ginger chicken. This was swamped with way to much sauce. There was no ginger taste and it was super salty. Should have gone with my gut and stood firm and not be talked into going. 

A flavorless meal."}
{"text":"FILTHY!!!
Stopped in for lunch on Sunday. Placed our order, proceeded to find a booth to sit in. All the booths were dirty. The table tops were clean, or so I thought. I accidentally grabbed the bottom of the table and got who knows what I'll over my hands. I went to the bathroom and the bathroom was also dirty. Came back to my booth and waited for my food. Looking around I noticed food on the wall and picture frame. The sad thing is that the testy has not even been open 30 minutes. Restaurant needs some serious cleaning. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Showed up for dinner 25min before close and they had dumped the ice tea  because they where trying to get out of the building as fast as they could at 9pm and had no alternative for a diabetic ...  rude and would not provide a manager when I asked them for one...  will not go back and I live in the neighborhood...."}
{"text":"Omg..this was my favorite place ever..never mind so dissapointed last time visiting for sure.im sad..my plate was very dirty.when i told the waitress she gave me attitude and change my food to an other dirty plate..bad service and dirty plates.c,mon.."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a coworker today. The small portions are overpriced and really aren't small-half would've been more than enough. 
We were served quickly and the staff was friendly! The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed quickly. 
I was disappointed with my Mongolian chicken. It tasted more like Teriyaki and was swimming in sauce. I had at least a 1/3 cup of sauce left on my plate after eating my food.
All in all, PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Definitely not authentic but if you're looking for authenticity, any chain restaurant isn't the way to go.

Here's what I recommend getting:
-Dynamite Chicken
-Lettuce Wraps
-Pad Thai (get tofu!)

Don't get:
-their sushi
-their Kung pao chicken

The flavors at Pei Wei are always good!"}
{"text":"The new \"Wei Better Orange Chicken\" sounded like a real good idea, as did the sweet and sour chicken kids meals. We ordered for everyone in our family. At one point my three year old shows me the little \"buggy\" she was playing with and I looked over and she was playing with a freshly wok'd caterpillar!!! Bright green and looked just like broccoli. No longer interested in eating there so I brought the little Szechuan caterpillar up to the manager and her response: \"we use fresh vegetables, so...\" anyway... the manager didn't seem to see it as an issue. Caterpillars in your food is not normal. Probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, but my food was disgusting.

The bad: pork egg rolls. Dripping, pooling in a swamp of cooking oil. I squeezed by rolls and extracted at least 1/4 cup of oil.

Also bad: wantons. They came with the soup. In the bottom of the bowl was a pool of cold, smelly, oil.

Pei Wei has been ok in the past, but something has changed... and it is not good."}
{"text":"This place is shit.  They make you call in to place an order, then make you sit on hold with an automated message that says place your order online.  This place is absolute shit."}
{"text":"Good food but it's Saturday night and they have ONE bottle of beer in the entire restaurant. The cashier was not friendly and made no attempt to ask the manager if there was more in the back.  As much as I like their food, my wife and I almost walked out because of the ( lack of) service."}
{"text":"It seems that the food was good a year ago, but tonight was another story. The sushi wasn't fresh. The mushrooms were bitter and tasted old. The carrots were way past their prime, and my 7:00 P.M. order wasn't ready until 7:15 P.M. and even though I sent my order online before I arrived, I watched three different people order and receive their food before I got mine. Getting pretty lazy and sloppy for the price."}
{"text":"Great Mongolian chicken or beef. We also get the honey seared chicken. The wonton soup and lettuce wraps are a great start."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on this places. Reminds me of a Panda Express mixed with a pfchangs.

The cashier was not all there. she just couldnt understand our order and im not really sure why. after the third time she finally could understand and comprehend what we were getting. (sweet and sour chicken w/rice, monogolian chicken w/rice, kids honey seared chicken with rice, and lastly we wanted to add another combo of honey seared chicken w/rice) whats hard to get???

anyway, the food came out relatively fast. I like that they have chili and hot mustard by the drinks. also a good selection of fresh tea and fortune cookies.

The food was good, small portions and tasty. 

When we were finished we went and chinese to go boxes which are also located near the drink section. Didnt like that a woman came over to grab our plates, promised to bring me a bag for the to go boxes but instead went and chatted with a coworker for ten minutes. Clearly forgetting what she said she would do. In the end we just got up and left.

Considering the price compared to panda and their portions, i think next time i would rather go there."}
{"text":"Very different from our last visit. There is a change, a new/shorter menu with far less choices. This makes the waiting line move faster as diners will make up their minds faster. Let's face it, all selections are base upon a few ingredients, mixed together for different menu items. All in all, a great low cost lunch is offered."}
{"text":"Wow...I didn't even have high expectations and was still very disappointed.  Seating was horrific, tables uncleaned, food ready to be served waiting at the kitchen....
Wayyy overrated and better off at Panda Express if you want fast put together Chinese \"Asian fusion\".  Just under $30 for 2 \"regular\" dishes, a couple of egg rolls & 2 drinks?  For what we got?  Left there greatly disappointed and will not go back."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for family outings. All three of my kids enjoy the \"Honey-Seared Chicken with Noodles\", they love it! And that means that we get to enjoy our lunch/dinner when we eat there.
My hubby usually orders the Kung-Pao Beef, which I prefer over the chicken, because the meat gets a caramelization that the chicken doesn't get. And me, I am usually the one that orders the \"new\" dish that they are introducing, like las week was the \"Black Pepper Chicken\", which with tender and crunchy asparagus, was a very yummy dish! And it never hurts if you get a BOGO coupon in your inbox every once in a while!!"}
{"text":"Sadly I got the teriyaki crunch rolls for lunch. Usually a roll - 8 pieces is enough for my lunch and sometimes dinner. Not today, not at this Pei Wei. I've never seen smaller rolls anywhere. And, the crunch was Panko sprinkled on top of the rolls. The vegetables inside the rolls didn't seem fresh at all. Just no. Never again. Don't get their rolls."}
{"text":"I had lunch there last Friday and they were advertising a Korean short rib lunch.   I took the bait and either they know nothing about Korean taste or they put black bean Chinese sauce on the short ribs by mistake.   It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in quite a while. I had the displeasure of eating at the one near the Phx/Scottsdale border over on Indian School and 44th Street, (BAD service from jump street, wrong order, remade it, still wrong, etc. and bitchy girl working the counter with attitude.) SO...thought I would come back and try this one and get take-out. Yeah...not impressed. Ordered the larger portion of Mongolian Beef. This portion seemed like a smaller one to me, and most of the beef had a ton of fat on it, and I ended up throwing most of it in the trash. Nearly $10 for fatty, inedible beef and a few veggies over rice?  Nah...I think I'm done. This location has gone really downhill. I'm inclined to think the entire chain just sucks anymore."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this particular venue and others over the last few years and the service and food are usually pretty good. Today; WTF Pei Wei?? It's 2:30 in the afternoon, it's dead inside, and the counter help are just standing around. I place an order of Mongolian Beef over white rice, hold the mushrooms, but add bell pepper instead. Dine in. Simple enough, right? WRONG!!! l Let's see....waiting 30+ minutes for something so easy, bad sign. Shows up at my table. No scallions, and FILLED with mushrooms. I explain the issue and send it back. Then I realize I don't have time to stay and eat, as lunch time for me will soon end,.So I voice my displeasure and concern to some young woman who I was told was in charge, and asked for my entree to go. She was nice enough to take the price of my lunch off the debit I had submitted to the cashier, and explained it would be tonight before I see the credit. My entree was shoved out and literally shoved into the take out container, and packed to go. I opened the container, and the now tossed around food didn't look right. I asked her if this was the right amount. She seemed very put out by my question and assured me it was. By this time I'm fuming and just want to leave. When I get back to work and open the entree lid, I realized why it didn't look right; Scallions still missing!! WTF? How hard is it to get such a simple order right??? Perhaps if the cook read English....he could have actually discerned how I ordered my meal. Perhaps if the people working today actually gave a rat's behind about customer service and doing it right, I wouldn't be on YELP. Unprofessional, sloppy, and rude. And people in this field want $15 an hour?? You've got to be kidding me. Told everyone at the office who usually eats there, about my ordeal. None of us will be back."}
{"text":"Pei Wei has always been a great way to grab a quick bite to take home on a busy weekday and used to be a stand-by for Chinese food when I lived in 'Tukee. So it only made sense that while Meg and I were dog sitting in the area that we decided to pick some up. We quickly found out that things definitely weren't like they used to be.

I first noticed that they had drastically reduced their menu since I was last in, seeming to focus more on their lettuce wrap options since those are their most popular item. No problem! They still had Kung Pao on their menu so we were fine with that. Took home a regular sized order of Kung Pao Chicken (requested extra hot) with lettuce cups and a side of brown rice.

The amount of Kung Pao we got was barely enough for one person. We're talking maybe 2/3 cups of Kung Pao total. If this was a regular order, I'm scared to see what a small order would have looked like. After sitting down to eat it we found that not only was this a ridiculously small portion but was bland, bland, bland. Not even a hint of spice to it and the chicken appeared to be just lightly dusted with seasoning as if someone put it on as an after thought. After stomaching it in hopes to at least be satisfied for the night, we quickly found out it was not enough for two people and we ended up going out for more food elsewhere after.

Sad to say but there has definitely been a decline in quality food wise. From flavorless food to small portions that would only satisfy you is you ate a mountain of rice with it. With other local offerings nearby, It may be a long while before I give Pei Wei another try."}
{"text":"Every time we try to order take out here we are on the phone for 10 plus minutes to get a human saying hello. This time after 15 minutes I drove there, still on hold to find a less than busy business. I didn't buy anything because I don't want this location getting any of my business. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Always been a pei Wei fan it's easy Chinese food. I prefer dining out because it's loud and kinda cluttered in the space. My favorite part, they have vanilla coke. I'm a sucker for vanilla coke."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. Sometimes it's really good and sometimes the meat is chewy and that throws the dish off.  For a chain it's pretty decent,  definitely better than panda express."}
{"text":"Absolutley terrible!!!!! I havent been there for a few years..   but definately wont be back!!!! All tasted the same... very few veg...very fine if there was any in there at all. I cant remember the dish but called for noodles.......SPAGHETTI IN A CHINESE DISH...  NO,NO!!!! Just cant believe it has went downhill so bad!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stop in at Pei Wei for lunch or dinner. ALWAYS TASTY, CLEAN and REPUTABLE. I prefer their McDowell and 7th Ave location. Cashew Chicken is SUPERB."}
{"text":"So wanted to mix up my recovery meal after bike clinic. Pei Wei is spot on radar since located near by. I had no idea that it was part of the PF Chang group but once thought about it looking at the menu makes sense. The first impression definitely on point thinking fancy or upscale version of Panda. I know they have few PW across the city. The menu is pretty straight forward with your choices. I decided try the Thai Dynamite with Chicken for entree and got four piece spicy tuna roll for starter. The spicy tuna roll honest not something would order again. Maybe ordering sushi in really fast food concept not good idea. The tuna was really dark color not fresh looking at all. To the manager credit I never asked for another order but as soon as different employee dropped it off she was like this one looks better. The color only slightly better but I do appreciate the manager taking initiative. 

TheThai Dynamite with Chicken. It was ok at best. The chicken were nice size pieces of chicken, cooked on point, and the sauce was good. They needed put more sauce on it. Most of the pieces of chicken not even covered in sauce. The lack of sauce killed it for me, The vegetables came with it were fresh and tasty. The amount of rice on the plate was crazy. I do love my rice! 

The service was nothing like the food. It was five star service from the manager taking initiative brought out another spicy tuna roll. I place my order being first timer explaining all my options. Other employees making sure everything was good once got my food and when leaving thanks for coming in."}
{"text":"BOMB this place is my spot, you get a lot of food for your money.
the vietnamise chicken salad rolls are so bomb.

love the chill music. and the interior its pretty cool and chill also. 
i come here like every other week. 
BOMB!"}
{"text":"Raili and Susan are the most incredible workers. always in a great mood and happy to help me when I come in sometimes I will come in to eat just to visit them!! Both are patient as well with my questions! Food is always wonderful and staff is welcoming. 10/10 would recommend pei wei on 67th Ave & the 101."}
{"text":"If you read the rest of the reviews and look at the plate size you will notice that they all basically have the large round plates.  Well last night we ate here and ordered the large or regular size entrees and got the once used appetizer size plates.  I felt really cheated because we've been coming here since it opened.  Over the years we've notice the massive change in people working here, the ones we knew are gone and everybody is new.  Food tasted mediocre and hasn't changed in years, but it was worse before so I guess it has improved.  Gotta work on trying not to scam the paying public cause it will catch up.  Use the right dishes for the service and no one will complain. Will I go back, maybe in the far future cause it's really not worth the money.  Being from Hawaii I know oriental foods and I love good Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, any Asian cooking and Vegas has nothing like back home."}
{"text":"Nice spot to grab a casual lunch or dinner. Always fast service and a clean dining room. Their Chai Iced Tea is really good, and they have a fancy coca cola machine you can experiment with to create a unique drink.

My favorite entrees are Thai Dynamite with crispy chicken and Caramel chicken. You can choose white, brown, or fried rice. You can also add a side of rice for only 50 cents.

I love the diner select menu. It offers a few of the entrees in a smaller portion size and comes with an egg roll or wonton soup. At $6.25, it's a great deal and you don't feel stuffed afterwards."}
{"text":"We've been going here since we moved to Charlotte in 2009. The food is very consistent, and the service is good. Very accommodating to small children. The caramel chicken is my favorite.

The new coca cola vending machine is a bit gimmicky, but all in all, just as good food as PF Changs for half the price."}
{"text":"Ive been listening to Gambo on Arizona Sports Radio talk about Pei Wei for the past year. So I decided to give it a try. This was my first visit. I had the steamed broccoli chicken breast, brown rice with garlic sauce on the side. The meal was very good and healthy too. By having the sauce on the side and just dipping my fork into it now then reduced the amount of sodium intake. The platter size was a good portion and cost less than $10.00 for the whole meal. A great value. I only gavr it a four because the seating in the restaurant was cramped. Overall a good choice."}
{"text":"We tried again at 900 pm and they had sushi, yeah! The wait time was adequate and the hostess was very polite and professional. I am hopeful this Pei wei is actively trying to improve the overall experience."}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner at various Pei Wei restaurants in the Phoenix area. I love the food especially at the Test Kitchen where you can try the new selections However when you go to this particular Pei Wei I suggest you bring your own silverware as theirs is filthy. In addition I suggest you wear a sweater and warm coat as it is freezing cold inside. We brought this to the attention of the manager who remarked that she was well aware since others had complained and she couldn't correct the problem as her thermostat was in the back room and regulated by the home office. Every single person in the restaurant was wearing a coat while trying to eat. Totally unacceptable.
Update December 2017. Tried again. No more test menu. Silverware still filthy, bathrooms disgusting, floor dirty. Talked to manager who said so we will clean it later."}
{"text":"Last night we waited 30 minutes just to get our food while others waited just as long and even longer!! One couple waited a whole hour!!!! Many people were getting refunds because of the crazy wait times. This was absolutely ridiculous and this place needs to get their crap together with new management!! When I got my Dan Dan Noodles,  it was literally swimming in sauce!! It was soup!! Disgusting!! Never going there again!!! Get your crap together!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always pretty good but the people who work here have the WORST attitude so eat here only if it's convenient and you can get in and out quickly..."}
{"text":"I must say, I do not really like thier food. 

But since they do not use any hydrogenated oils, I wanted to give them a shout out for doing it the right way"}
{"text":"Ordered some sushi rolls tonight. I have to say the rolls were definitely pre-made and kept in the refrigerator. The rice was hard, dry, and cold to the touch. I have to say I am quite disappointed. Way to be lazy pei wei... Should have gone to Stingray across the street."}
{"text":"You know how everyone has that friend who says they LOVE Mexican food and when you ask what their favorite kind of Mexican food is, they say it's a toss-up between the Crunchwrap Supreme and Cinna-twists? These are the same people who like Pei Wei. Pei Wei is Asian food for people who hate Asian food but don't know they hate Asian food because they've literally never had Asian food except for Pei Wei. Even Panda Express is more authentic than Pei Wei. Man, Pei Wei is just so bad. 

I've been to Pei Wei before. I am never expecting authentic Asian food (I'm not a fool), but I am disappointed EVERY TIME I GO. Their menu just looks so enticing, and then you get the food and it's SO bland and boring EVERY SINGLE TIME. That's why they get 3 stars. Maybe I was exaggerating a bit before when I said they were \"so bad\", because they're not BAD-bad in the sense that their food sucks. They're just regular-bad in the sense that their food is NOT GOOD... EVER. 

I went there on 8/20/14 and ordered the Korean steak lettuce wraps and their new Mango California Rolls. I'm not usually a California roll type of girl, but they looked pretty good in the picture on the wall and I thought the mango-spin sounded like it had potential. 

I am like 95% positive the \"Korean Steak\" was ground beef with teriyaki sauce. Like, I'm pretty sure they just use the same teriyaki sauce on everything. I don't know how they're differentiating their \"Korean\" style foods from their Thai/Japanese/Chinese foods, but then I realized.. wait, they just call it \"Korean\" because they're like, \"Well, we already listed four other things as Thai and six other things as Japanese, so this one can just be 'Korean'. Yeah, that sounds good!\"

I had four pieces of the Mango California Roll, only one of which had a sliver of mango in it. Meh, whatever. I was cool with it because turns out you can't taste the mango in it anyway. I absolutely do not recommend using the dipping sauce they give you with it though. Like, not even because I'm prejudice against Pei Wei. It was legitimately bad, like they need to stop serving it immediately. It was some weird Minute Maid orange juice, vinegar, soy sauce mixture and it was horrible. Did I get the recipe right though? Can someone who works at Pei Wei comment on this? I am pretty sure I'm at least close. Don't even try it!"}
{"text":"This specific Pei Wei is the best in 3 states I've been to. Ordered spicy salad w/shrimp to go. They have a gluten free menu (who knew!) and the salad and shrimp were perfect. Unlike Paradise (3 doors down) who gives 3 peices of lettuce and a tomato, PW does it right - large salad, right amt. of shrimp. 

Plus, since I can't have soy sauce, one of the girls actually caught my mistake last time - spring rolls are made with a SS mixture. Saved me a trip to ER! 

Thanks to the ladies at the counter - you are fast, effecient, and knowledgeable about what you serve, really don't find that much anymore. Kudos to your staff and food Ocotillo Pei Wei - best salad and staff by far!"}
{"text":"We just stood in line for 20 minutes, we begin to order and the cashier tells us it will be an hour wait for everything on the menu except for salads.  Walked across to Keegan's, were seated immediately and order taken within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Wow, incredibly slow. Wasn't always like this so I don't know what's up. 25 min wait on to go order. 1 lettuce wrap. Won't be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"WTF PEI WEI? I shalnt and willnt be returning to this location EVER AGAIN! 
Not only is the cafeteria like dining area lacking personality, it's now remarkably uncomfortable. 

On to the real reason we all USED to frequent the Asian affiliated eatery, the food. Unfortunately somebody decided to redo the menu, dropping a few of my favs which was tragic in itself, I mean I didn't even get to taste goodbye. My number one, numero uno did make the cut, Mandarin kung pao and i have always been close. But without the chunky pieces of chicken I have come to love and expect, It seems we have drifted apart. Something we said we would never let happen to us.

Do yourself a favor, avoid this pee wee altogether.
((sobbing begins))"}
{"text":"Okay, so not exactly authentic, but just as good as Chang's in my opinion.   I would recommend Pei Wei if you are in the mood for Chinese and want to get something consistent.  They make their food to order, but it pretty much always tastes the same.  It's like a fast food version of P.F Chang's and cheaper.   My favorite is the Mongolian with Tofu and Veggies.  If you are ordering takeout, I would recommend calling ahead at least 25 minutes before you want to pick it up.  I have called and been told 30-45 minutes until my order was ready, because it was lunch time or behind a huge order."}
{"text":"(1st time) I placed an order using the app (which said my order would be ready in 15 minutes) and when I arrived to the restaurant, I waited over an hour for my food. After finally getting my food, I didn't realize they had given me the wrong order until I got to my car. I walked back in and waited an additional 15 minutes for low quality food. Corporate responded to my inquiry regarding the poor customer service and gave me a Be Our Guest coupon card for my next visit. (2nd time) When I went back and attempted to use the card, the cashier advised none of the Be Our Guest cards were working, so I ended up paying in full. As I was eating my food in the lobby and responding to corporate informing them about the invalid cards, I found a small piece of metal(resembled a staple) in my rice bowl!!! I sent a picture to corporate and they still have not reached out. Aside from these instances, I have called on 3 separate occasions and placed on hold for over 10 minutes causing me to just hang up. The customer service is so poor!!!! I will NEVER go back to this location."}
{"text":"We are in town for ST and orders to go from a known name, but we're greatly disappointed. The food wasn't ready for pickup at the time, had to wait 20'. They were out of soy sauce, had to get some from their neighbor. What is sushi without soy? The mango roll had No mango. The wasabi crunch roll wasn't crunchy or spicy. The lettuce wraps were strips of lettuce and had been frozen at some point. The only thing we ordered that was good was the lime chicken with cold noodles. The to go bill was over $50, not worth it. Highly disappointed and will not come back."}
{"text":"Usually I\"m a fan, just a tad disappointing this time. Got a pretty big takeout order and was shorted the lettuce for the lettuce wraps - my fault for not double-checking but my focus was more on making sure I had all the entrees. Hot and sour soup wasn't quite as flavorful as it usually is, seemed a little on the watery side. 

On the plus side, front counter service was spot on as usual. Staff was cheerful, helpful, and more than accommodating with condiments, chopsticks, etc.  My order wasn't quite ready when I showed up so I was given a free drink while I waited the 2-3 minutes while it was being completed. Thought that was a nice touch. 

Overall a good experience, just not 4-5 stars like it usually is."}
{"text":"The reason people's orders are wrong is because this place it TOTALLY INSANE! I go there sometimes for lunch and enter through the pick up entrance and it's always crazy. Customers standing around everywhere not sure who has ordered or who is waiting for food. I feel sorry for the staff as they are nice people but I wouldn't want to work there. Too chaotic for me. No thanks..."}
{"text":"The bad experience first started when I tried to call in to place a pick up order. Waited for 10 min for someone to pickup, no one ever did. I just assumed maybe they were busy, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I drove to the location and there we no line and it was not busy at all. I don't know how I could have been on hold for over 10 min.  Went to the location because there website was advertising if you buy an entree then you will receive a free new orange chicken bowl. I asked about that and the cashier said there was no such thing( even though it is clearly on the website as valid from 3/23-3/25z. Ended up ordering the mango chicken, it was ok."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is great but as everyone says this location needs to fix some things. Service is alright and food is usually good except for one super annoying issue that has happened to me for now the 3rd time.

I love the lettuce wraps. Anywhere else and you get decent lettuce that you can actually make a wrap out of. But not this location. Every time I get lettuce wraps it's like the choose the lowest quality shreds of lettuce to give me. Not just whole pieces of lettuce but literally shreds. How the hell and I supposed to make a wrap out of lettuce that comes all yellow and shredded up? It all goes down the same but they shouldn't call it lettuce wraps. They should call it chicken medley with a side of shredded yellow lettuce."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at a pei Wei. Got the Mongolian beef the meet was cook until it was a rice crispy. I had to track 2 people down to bus the table. Do not go to this location what a waste of money"}
{"text":"This location is one of my favorites. Their food is always fresh and well cooked. I have only had a bad experience here once but that was an over the phone order. I had ordered the kung pao chicken but they gave me tofu instead. I called and told them about it because I went during work and I work pretty far away it was gonna take me 15 minutes to go and get it exchanged and 15 minutes to go back to work. The manager was very understanding and apologized. He offered me my meal for free next time I came in and wrote down my information I also took a picture of my food so that he could see including my receipt. I showed it to the employee and they gave me my free meal. Also their customer service is great I have not had a bad experience with any of the workers there. They are always respectful and cheerful. That is definitely something very important at a restaurant. No matter how far I am because I live about 25 min away, I always come to this location since the location near me I don't really like their food. Their chicken is chewy and weird. On the contrary the location here in Avondale they have pretty good chicken and I never get those nasty chewy pieces."}
{"text":"First time here at Pei Wei. 
I was a little hesitant to eat here because I've never heard anyone talk about it nor suggest to ever eat here, however,  I saw that they are owned by the same group as P.F Chang's and I know people LOVE P.F Chang's so what the heck!?$@ lets give the \"fast food\" version of P.F Chang's a try! should be good, right? 

We were greeted by the cashier who was friendly and was patient with me as we skimmed through the menu. After we ordered we waited at the counter since they had seats and watched the cooks do there thang since they had an open kitchen which is cool to see because you don't get to normally see what goes on in kitchen. 

We ordered the Crab Rangoon's which was tasted a little gritty, crab flavor was there except I tasted no crab, the hot and sour soup was not too shabby, I almost wanted it a tad bit more sour but that's just me. For the entreeSSSS WE got honey seared chicken w/ noodles, Mongolian Chicken w/ rice and what the heck, why not get the $5 General Tso's Chicken. So the noodles had no flavor, so we had to mix it in with one of the sauces from the entrees we ordered which made it all better. The rice was a little on the hard side and dry. The meats were okay, some better than the other and lacking a little flavor. 

I'm not sure if I'll return only because I feel I can get better quality Chinese food elsewhere but I'm glad I gave it shot and now I know."}
{"text":"Honey seared chicken is so good.  Pork egg rolls a bit greasy though."}
{"text":"A 40 minute wait for \"fast casual\" Pei Wei tonight. Does seem any where near fast? What a waste of my time."}
{"text":"fresh, hot, fast service.
food is great and have been going their for 6 years.
very affordable menu and you can add extra veggies"}
{"text":"Decent size food portions.  We brought some home for later.  Better than a Panda Express, and a better feel as well.  The steak was not that good to me and they put red bell peppers in the fried rice.  I cannot stand bell peppers.  Price was a little high in my book for what it was.  

It was clean inside and the staff was uber friendly.  Would consider coming back here, but not going to go out of our way to do it."}
{"text":"They have some decent vegetarian options. You can get veggies & tofu as your protein choice.  Plus the iced tea is great. I love that they have 2 different serving size options too."}
{"text":"The service to this Pei Wei was fine.  The problem came from the taste of the food.  I ordered the Japanese Steak and Shrimp Ramen.  The first thing you will notice is there is no broth.  There is a tiny bit on the bottom but not a significant amount.  Overall there was enough meat and shrimp but for $10  there better be.  The problem with this came from the taste.  It is on the spicy side so if you don't like it spicy you have been warned.  The noodles were a bit on the stiff side.  Kind of reminded me like the type of noodles you would get from a pizza place that had their noodles sitting in the fridge over night.  

To cover up for the lack of flavor it looks like they tried to mask it using a spicy red chille sauce.  I have had better tasting top ramen then this dish.  I have had real ramen before and I consider this an insult to my taste buds.  I would have been happy with this dish even with no broth if it tasted good.  My advice is if you want your Mongolian or king pao chicken then you are fine.  If you want a noodle dish I would recommend going to one of the new more authentic ramen places in the Valley."}
{"text":"I have an order from almost a month ago and cannot get this location to answer the phone. It rings forever. Same message for hours, we are assisting other guests. B S.One time in a month some one man answered, and was to take care of the problem, and said phone have not been working properly. and never heard back. This place is worse than the Black Plague to get results. Try calling 480-308-9898. Many orders placed and the whole order was totally messed up. What a place to not do ordering thru. Total terrible. Will check back and see if this gets results! Not holding my breath!"}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei. I've been a patron here for years. Lately though, there's inconsistency with their food, especially the Mango Sushi Rolls and the Edamame.

I've ordered takeout 3 times in the past 3 or 4 months. On more than 1 occasion, my edamame has been crunchy from being undercooked. So, I've requested my edamame to be double steamed...sometimes it's a hit or miss. Also, I've ordered the large size, only to receive a small portion.

The mango sushi rolls were a hit for me when I dined in. I thought I'd order them for takeout. On more than one occasion in the past, I've requested extra ginger because they barely put enough ginger in the container for each roll. I've had to call the manager to let him know I didn't receive my extra ginger. The most recent order they made the mango rolls crunchy, and included 3 slices of ginger. :(

Although he has credited my card at least twice for the inconveniences...I'd really love to just have my order the way I requested. It's a huge disappointment after driving to pick up your food, anxious to get home to eat it and it isn't prepared properly. :("}
{"text":"The shrimp that they served with my food tastes starchy and almost like there was this unnatural powdery tasting covering that was really unpleasant to eat. The shrimp most certainly does not taste or look how shrimp should. I got the ginger soy broccoli with lo mein and shrimp and the food aside from the shrimp was overall pretty average. I had heard some good things about pei wei and when I arrived, there was a relatively long line so it seemed promising. However, the food was not nearly good enough to be a place I would return to."}
{"text":"What the heck?! My fiance and I eat here weekly, this is my neighborhood Pei-Wei and our experiences have been crazy bad lately! :(

Last time my fiance ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It came out with no snow peas. My fiance asked about it and the server says, \"yeah, we just ran out of them\". No extra peanuts, no \"can I substitute something else for you?\"...nothing. End of discussion, apparently. 

Tonight we go in about 7:30pm and my fiance was daydreaming a bit after he received his receipt. The cashier informed him, \"you can leave now\".  We receive our usual; his Kung Pao Chicken and my lettuce wraps. His Kung Pao noodles were so overcooked they were like chewing paste. My lettuce wraps tasted fine, but two hours later and I was incapacitated with stomach pains. Just finished expunging the remainder of the wraps, and I am starting to feel okay. And no, it could not have been anything else I ate. Or a virus. They don't come and go so quickly. 

Next time we are craving Pei-Wei, we will be making the drive to the East Phoenix location."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei, love the food.  Get take out all the time from many of their locations.  This review is regarding the General Manager Stacey on 9-30-16.  Gainey Village location.  I came into the restaurant and she was sitting at a table with two employees. I was ordering takeout!! All I could hear was her degrading and reprimanding two employees in the dining room where other patrons were sitting.  It was HORRIBLE! I was in shock at the lack of professionalism, this is why I asked for her name and am leaving a review. How could she feel that was ok? Doesn't she have an office where she can insult and reprimand her staff.  Instead she let the entire restaurant know, staff and patrons that one of the guys washed the lettuce wrong...and on and on and on!!  Come on Stacey, you are a manager, and should act like one and that doesn't mean degrade your staff for the world to hear.  How humiliating for them.  Hope the higher up management sees this and lets her know it's unacceptable... you, I'm sure lost every customer in that dining room.  Pretty awful scene."}
{"text":"Is it me, or did Pei Wei change the Orange Chicken - had it twice this week, and both times the meat seemed to be all white meat, more lightly breaded and less crispy than it used to be.  Did they decide to make it more healthy?

Anyway, it's still a tasty place to get your Asian fusion on - quick and reasonably priced.

Good for lunch or dinner.  (and, they have the Coke machines with the Lime Coke option!)"}
{"text":"Yum! Pei Wei has delicious Asian meals on the cheap. The atmosphere is also very nice, with well-thought-out lighting and digital menus that are easy to read. The rice dishes feature massive portions of food. Even when the place is packed (which it often is!) food is made quickly and is always steaming hot. My only complaint would be that the prices have gone up by about $1 since I started going to this location last June, which is my only reason to deduct a star. 

Great location and nice outdoor seating make this place even better. 
Even though prices are similar, I find Pei Wei to be a step above Panda Express as the selection is larger and the food tastes fresher (probably because they haven't been sitting in a wok for hours). Go check it out! I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great for catering family get togethers at Grandmothers place. We usually get 3 to 4 trays for 12 people."}
{"text":"This place is at its lowest level for food than ever.  I just tried to eat there,  ordered the super greens dish, and it was so bad, I left it after 2 bites. The rice was dried out and is in chunks. Covered in a weird and gross Luke warm gravy. There are a few dishes that work ok, but there are not very many.

This is not an isolated incident,  the food here is just bad."}
{"text":"Five of us ordered dinner tonight. 
Lettuce wraps tastes like burnt popcorn 
I asked for no red pepper on my chicken and ordered fried rice. They failed to mention that the fried rice is LOADED with red peppers. Not really sure why they call this fried rice. 
One dish chicken was so tough. Asked for a replacement. Gave a bowl of meat. No veggies or rice like original dish 
Everyone's meal was gross!"}
{"text":"I went to Pei Wei the other day and it took almost over an hour to get our food ridiculous they said they only had one cook which is not my problem but for it being a good place to eat the other day really sucked and there was many people in there that felt the same"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through a third party app. With that being said my review is entirely about the food since I've never visited a Pei Wei in person. 

In my own opinion the food needs more flavor and less sweetness. I ordered two different types of sushi. One was the spicy tuna roll. It had no spice whats so ever. Plus the rolls are the smallest I've ever eaten. 
My other orders were kids low mein meals with chicken. My daughter mentioned that it didn't have flavor. The other dish I ordered was a small noodles meal with shrimp. It was eatable but not enjoyable. 

I will not willingly go or eat pei wei again unless I have to."}
{"text":"I've been here a countless amount of times. I had been wanting Pei Wei for about two weeks. Finally decided
To go and get lettuce wraps and one spring roll. Quick as always but wraps just didn't taste right. They had an \"aftertaste\" not a good one either. Spring roll was okay. Could taste the go ginger and the seaweed was too chewy. Very disappointed and am in no hurry to run back."}
{"text":"This place is my Go To! After an evening run or gym session. Their food is fresh, crisp, and delish . I highly recommend this place, price wise, it's comparable to Chipotles but taste wise, it's more on the P.F. Chang's level.  If you didn't know, now you know."}
{"text":"First time at this Pei Wei and first at any in about 5 years. The menu has obviously changed. The ordering system was simple. You order the size, the protein and the style but I think it would make a lot more sense to order the style (Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef, etc.) first. 

I asked what sizes they had and the guy says: \"We have lunch size and a bigger one.\"  Okay. I ordered a lunch sized Mongolian Beef. 

My faux hawk 'server' dropped it off without a hint of pleasure in his face. Sad that he is working angry. 

My entree arrived with about 3 ounces of beef, six pieces of beef!  It was mostly rice. They had a good condiment section tho, with Chinese mustard, Sambal Oelek and soy sauce. 

The drinks are also good, with the auto select dispenser. 

While eating I overheard faux hawk mocking other guests to a coworker and almost smiled while bashing his paying customer. Almost. 

Can't recommend this Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pei Wei. My favorite thing to get is the ginger broccoli and beef and the pork egg rolls. The staff is always very friendly and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but my friend wanted to come here and I happily tagged along.  We came in at around 6:30 and we seemed to hit the early diners as we were the only people in the restaurant who were under the age of 80 :). 

Although the restaurant was pretty packed, we managed to get our order in and find a decently clean place to sit. The servers at Pei Wei are mostly high schoolers but they are pretty nice and helpful. We ordered the kung pao chicken and the mongolian beef, both with brown rice.

I thought the food was average/decent for Americanized/chain/fast food-like Asian food. I do appreciate the availability of brown rice as it allows you to healthen-up (I don't think that's a real word) your meal. In terms of flavor, the mongolian beef was tasty and the meat was juicy. My friend loves the Kung Pao chicken mostly because of the sauce so he orders an extra order of just the juice to dip the meat in or spread in the rice- great way to boost the flavor in your dinner.

Food comes around pretty quickly, you pay up front and get your own drinks and they buss the tables for you. Not bad for a fairly quick dinner."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been a loyal Pei Wei customer for years & just yesterday I was told by a kitchen line cook named Loren, never to return to that restaurant on McClintock or she would call the cops because she claimed that I was harassing her employees, when in fact, I called earlier that day & left a message for Loren to return my call to resolve a reward point issue, however, she never returned my call. I've been trying to ask for help & no one cares to address the problem, so Pei Wei's idea of a resolution is to tell me to leave the restaurant because they refuse to help me &  they apparently don't know how too. Really, Pei Wei? You people have stooped to the lowest level of bad customer service. Mind you, I told Loren that a few days prior, I was there to pick up my food & I over heard the kitchen manager tell a server not to answer the phones & just take care of the front. Are you kidding me? The reason I showed up to complain is because I was trying to get through to order, as the phone rang off the hook several times & to let management know that one of their servers did not add my reward points. Why on earth does Pei Wei offer the rewards program if management & servers are not trained to resolve reward point issues, but if a paying customer complains that the cashier forgot to add a customer's points or if a server was rude, an order was wrong, a customer is considered a nuisance, so they should never return to that restaurant? Pei Wei, stop shifting blame on customers for your employees' bad behavior. 
I've been ordering food from this location for over 6 years & the customer service has deteriorated quickly. I've also noticed that you have a high turnover, which explains why I see new faces every few months. Whatever is happening internally at your restaurants,  are affecting your customers, especially reading other complaints on Yelp. How dare Loren threatened to call the cops on me & tell me never return to this restaurant for trying to resolve my reward point issues with the restaurant? Who is she to make that decision? I will be calling the corporate office to complain about this location for bad management & bad customer service."}
{"text":"I called on Friday (5/11) to  inquire about points that a server forgot to add this past Monday. Apparently, servers are clueless of how the reward point system works, so I asked to speak to a manager. When I spoke to a manager named Eric, he was cocky & rude. He more or less said it wasn't his problem & to contact Pei Wei online. I told him that he should take responsibility for his employee, who was dishonest with me & told me that he added my points, when in fact he didn't. I told Eric that I was going to leave a bad review on Yelp & he told me that it didn't matter because this location (Casa Paloma) was one of the best restaurants with great reviews. Really? Based on the bad reviews I've read, he has to be delusional. I sent a message to corporate & hopefully someone will contact me."}
{"text":"Loove me some Pei Wei! Boyfriend isn't a fan, so whenever I end up eating alone, this is my go-to. 

I have a bad habit of ordering the same thing over and over once I find something I like, so I can only say that the Dan-Dan Noodles are amazing! The eggrolls are also delicious. Taste can vary with regard to spiciness, but it's generally pretty consistent. 

Their online ordering system is my favorite and my food is ready and waiting on time, every time. The staff is super friendly. 

Great stop for some quick, tasty Asian food (I believe they cover at least 5 different Asian cuisines)."}
{"text":"This concept owned by PF Changs is a solid and quick alternative to the real thing. I was in the car with my family yesterday and hunger started to set in. We were in and out of Pei Way in about 20 minutes. My kids loved the teriyaki chicken. It did not have too much sauce, it was just right. I love that they give the option for white or brown rice. My husband and I split the pad thai. The portions are pretty big. They also offer some gluten free menu items. Its a great lunch spot for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried it once many years ago and my husband wanted to try it for the first time. The first time I tried it the rice was too sweet and I figured if they can mess up the rice, I don't want to come back. The guy was semi helpful when I explained the situation. He did laugh in an asshole way when I asked if our orders came with drinks. Maybe he missed the part about it being YEARS since I've been. My husband ordered the Mongolian steak with noodles and he enjoyed his meal. I had the terakyi chicken with white rice. I enjoyed my meal but wouldn't go out of my way for it. If you get what I ordered ask for no onion."}
{"text":"We had a hankering for some Chinese Fusion, and PeiWei indicated gluten free options...verrrrrryyyy limited gluten free options, as it turns out (do you want sweet chicken or spicy chicken? - ok or edamame, or, IIRC, two other appetizers).

I still like the orange peel chicken pretty well, and they have the cool Coke Freestyle machines, so you can get your Lime Coke fix).

(It's also nice to sit on the patio during the shoulder seasons.)"}
{"text":"Waited 7 minutes on hold to place a to go order. Drive to restaurant- They said their system had been down months  you can do better - my call had not even been routed to restaurant"}
{"text":"Honey seared shrimp and broccoli, small bowl. Very tasty and just the right amount of food. Cashier rang us up for extra veggies. Another Pei Wei person (assuming manager) delivered our food, saw we were charge for the broccoli, and refunded the extra charge, then brought the new receipt over. I like that she did this because she felt it was the right thing  to do. Clearly, not all locations are equal. The food was good and the service too. We'll visit this Pei Wei  again."}
{"text":"Came this location since it is closest to us and we were pleasantly surprised. The ordering process was efficient and we had no wait despite it being a busy lunch time. Restaurant is nicely decorated and has a nice layout. There is also outdoor seating. The only weird thing was that the food was not brought out all together. We got one dish....waited a bit....then another.....waited....and then another. I'm sure it was in effort to expedite our experience but it was just, different. Food was tasty (Pei Wei spicy, kids teriyaki chicken, and sweet and sour chicken) although my daughter's meal was lacking in the chicken portion department (think a big bowl of rice and 4 tiny pieces of chicken)."}
{"text":"I called in an order after leaving a near by tanning salon. I arrived earlier than my estimated pick up time by 15 minutes. Instead of making me wait, they got my order together right away. Very fast, friendly service. 
I've never been disappointed with their food. They are consistent with the quality and quantity every single time I eat here."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service not so much. I placed a takeout order online, arrived to pick it up as scheduled, paid for it, and stood there waiting 10 minutes with 4 or 5 other people - while the people behind the counter didn't even bother to look for my order, which (as it turns out) was sitting right there on the shelf in plain sight. Wtf?"}
{"text":"Food is usually good, service can be extremely hit or miss depending on the day, and they somehow managed to get a whole egg shell in my hot and sour soup..."}
{"text":"Love the food! Obsessed. 
Unfortunately the last three times I've tried to eat here the wait has been unbearably long. 
I tried calling ahead to order and was left on
Hold for 20 mins no answer. I then went into the location, line out the door. When I finally reached the front of the line, the girl at cashier told me it would be about 45 mins for my one order :( 
The staff seemed un organized and frustrated. 
I miss going to this restaurant as often as I would like."}
{"text":"Not great. I am standing in line waiting for food I ordered over 30 minutes ago. The 3 people behind the counter do not seem to be trained or able to to do their job without constant help from one another and there send to be a lot of confusion with their workflow. Line has been backed up to the door since I arrived."}
{"text":"Don't order take out unless you plan on either taking every container out of the bag and check it or driving home to be disappointed and have to drive back. Won't order take out from them again and may not go back to eat in wither"}
{"text":"I do love the food here but the staff is getting ridiculously unorganized. The employees always seem either overwhelmed or uneducated. I have seen several customers get uoset because their to go orders are placed on the counters but  NO ONE informs them so the food sots there getting cold. When the employees do make a mistakes, they do not seem sincere at all."}
{"text":"Good food, best locations are 7th st at Glendale, 7th Ave at McDowell and the Mesa, AZ  the food is well seasoned and good.  My favorites are Asian Coconut Curry beef w/brown rice and Chicken lettece wraps and the Lo mein that I steal bites of from my daughter.  All other locations I have tried are kind of bland."}
{"text":"First time at a Pei Wei in years. Arrived at 11:45 on a Thursday morning and there were six in line and a half full restaurant. 

I ordered small Orange Peel Chicken and a small drink for $9.91. A bit steep for a quick Chinese lunch. 

It arrived in nine mins. There was a good amount of food in the bowl, but the rice placated 2/3 of the dish. 

The chicken was cooked properly and the veggies were crisp but the rice was a bit stale. I felt it was cooked several hours ago. 

Perhaps it was traditional but the orange peels were 1 1/2\" long and therefore very distracting (bitter) to eat. Perhaps orange zest would've been more palatable. 

The service was good, if a bit limited. I got my food from a pleasant young man and then had my plate cleared by another. 

Not my go-to Chinese cuisine. 


Return visit, several months later. They added General's Chicken, my fave Chinese dish. I added a large drink for $7.98. Thank you Pei Wei!

My lunch arrived in six mins, cuz I was the second customer after opening. 

The rice was still dry. It must be the first thing they prepare?

I dislike bell pepper but usually pick them out. With this dish, they're diced finely, so no hope of getting them all. My fault tho, so it didn't affect my stars. It also arrived with shredded carrots and scallions and dried chilies. 

The chicken was plump, tender, plentiful and cooked well. It wasn't breaded however, probably for ease of cooking. After tasting , I prefer breaded. 

The soft drink machine was out of my first two choices tho. Sad, since I was the second customer. 

I will give it another go someday perhaps."}
{"text":"First time at this Pei Wei. Ordered for 13 for business meeting. 

I ordered the Thai Dynamite (along with nine others) with chicken. It was decent, with a good balance between the amount of protein and rice. Not very spicy though, which was unfortunate. I think they got overwhelmed by our voluminous order at 11:30 AM. 

We all wished they had labeled the tubs with names. We added names to the order but they all came mixed and with no names on them. Of course, a lot of them looked the same. It seriously took about twenty minutes to sort them all out. 

Hopefully they will take the time to do it right next time."}
{"text":"Great food great service! The Kung Pao Chicken is outstanding i would recommend always getting the larger portion its just that good"}
{"text":"We I normally go to a different location out of convenience -however this location is worth the drive! If you like P. F. Changs' - you will love Pei Wei! Same great quality and taste but faster and more reasonably priced! Excellent customer service! The food is delicious, always fresh and hot when brought to your table. I accidentally ordered the wrong entree for my husband -they brought me out the one I ordered plus the one my husband asked for at no extra charge. So we got to try something new and our favorite.  They even threw in a bag of their fresh cookies for the kids for the road!! Thanks for making our day! We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I also like the location and being able to sit outside. I have never had a problem with the service. They seem to be very fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I paid $9.59 for the larger size which is called the regular , they showed me the bigger plastic container but yet filled more than half of it with uncooked brown rice! In all you still end up with $2 worth of meat. No thanx I would rather go to mom & pops for that amount and get a whole dish of what you order at $10's a plate! Looks cute n fancy but not worth the price!"}
{"text":"Never been a huge fan of the chain despite any friends who love it. Decided to order some take out at 7pm knowing there is a possibly long line and sure enough I arrive to find one. I go the register, it's now 7:20 give my name and I'm told there is no record of my order. Seriously? I'm now in line waiting another 15-20 minutes for their incompetence. Decent food perhaps it good service definitely not."}
{"text":"Something very wrong here.  When my wife arrived, the staff informed her that they were running out of food & our order was not ready yet as only 1 chef had arrived.

When she arrived home, we noticed that all of the orders were wrong.  I did not have chicken fried rice.  She had only rice & 6 shrimp. Our daughters order was completely wrong.

We filed a complaint on pei wei's site."}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty here, and we have never had an issue with the food except for it being very high in calories in my opinion.

When they are semi busy though to stagger the number of people at the tables, they won't let you sit until you order.  I would understand if the tables were all full, but usually 7 or 8 are empty.  They will only run one register and just make people stand in line 20 - 30 minutes to wait to order.  I think the staff panics, and this is there way of coping with it, by making you stand in line for eternity.  Their business model is \"fast\" Asian food, but with the long wait to order, it is never quick for dinner even on a weekday.  Also as a result of everyone having to stand in the line a long time to order, peoples kids tend to get impatient and unruly and are running around in line as they don't have a place to sit.  It doesn't make for the best ambiance.

Otherwise, I recommend the orange peel chicken.  It is just a little spicy, not very much.  Probably not the healthiest thing to eat there, but it is yummy!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Pei Wei again last night and While we were waiting for our dinner I overheard a customer asking if they had tofu lettuce wraps...Because all that was listed was chicken lettuce wraps. To my great surprise the waitress said yes,we can make tofu vegan lettuce wraps for you! Guess what we are going to order next time...yup you guessed it...the tofu lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"First, let me say I love me some Pei Wei. I highly recommend the Dan Dan Noodles and Boyfriend likes the Teriyaki Rice Bowl. Technically, I believe each container has two servings in it, so you're getting a good amount of food, which is excellent, since it's pretty darn cheap. Also, online ordering is my favorite.

Now, I had never been to this particular location before (I frequent the one on Eastern, which is awesome), but we had an errand to run in the area, so I ordered online to pick up at this location. I arrived 5 minutes early and gave the girl at the counter my name. She said it would be just a minute. I ended up waiting 20 minutes, watched not one, but two walk-in customers order and RECEIVE their food and saw another person pick up their online order. Apparently, since I was sitting down next to the door, the counter girl thought I left. I stood up and see my food sitting behind the register. I saw her make the connection and asked her how long the food had been sitting there. She apologized, kinda, and sent me on my way. Who knows how long I'd have been waiting had I not gotten her attention.

Seems to me that a restaurant should be committed to getting customers their food when they say they will. I'll be sure to avoid this location in the future and I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's fairly quick and easy and moderately priced. I am a fan of the orange peel beef, terryaki chicken. lomein. I have also tried several other dishes and have not been dissapointed. The salads and suchi are very good also. Owned by PF Changs which should give you an indication of what your infor but much less expensive."}
{"text":"My favorite while living in Phoenix is the original chicken lettuce wrap.  I'd def pass on the Thai chicken lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"I understand being busy. But telling a paying customer you \"lost\" their food is unacceptable after waiting for more than 30 minutes. When they finally \"found\" my food, it still wasn't made right. He accused me of ordering my meal without nuts, which i didn't. I showed my receipt and he said oops and just pours the nut on my meal. I will not be going here again and i suggest you go elsewhere too"}
{"text":"Upon initial interaction with the cashier, we were told there was a 20-minute wait tonight for dine-in (even though the restaurant had only two  people dining in it) due to them not being able to keep up with the take-out orders.  The last time we were there, they said 40 minutes for the same excuse and therefore went elsewhere, so we figured 20 minutes may be worth it this time around.  I ordered Wei Better Orange Chicken and at around 35 minutes in, I mentioned to the employee delivering food to the tables that I hadn't received my order yet.  She said that the kitchen is running behind, but it will be out soon.  At 50 minutes, same conversation.  After an hour of sitting at the table and no delivery, I got up and left.  Looking at the faces of the folks sitting in line at the take-out register, I didn't feel alone in the opinion of how this place was run.  In the parking lot was a guy yelling out in frustration.  Another couple was sitting in their SUV waiting for their take-out order and they looked completely upset also.  It's a shame because I've been coming here for years and it used to be fast, well-run, and courteous.  There is an obvious lack of effective on-site management and the staff are not the same caliber that they traditionally would have employed.  Probably all a function of short-term myopia at corporate headquarters.  You can't blame the front-line workers when things go this bad."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I visited. I see some interesting changes. It would appear that Pei Wei is trying to drastically reduce costs. Gone are the plates, napkins, and sauces at the tables. The nice napkins have been replaced with those horrible industrial paper towels like you find in warehouse kitchens. No lunch specials are offered. The old entree size is now called \"large\" and is more expensive. The food tasted the same though."}
{"text":"I went to Pei Wei for some orange chicken.  They have an open kitchen area, a counter to order at, and a large seating area.  They also have a special door and counter area for take-out orders.  The orange chicken was $9.00 after tax.  The orange chicken here is very different than other recipes I've had but it is good.  The chicken is very lightly glazed in an orange sauce that is not overly sweet like some places (see my review of Tott's).  The chicken is accompanied by slivers of orange peal, soft thinly sliced carrots, crisp snow peas and a little bit of green onion and bean sprouts.  I appreciate the fact that I can taste the tender chicken because it is not deep fried.  The orange flavor is there but it is not overpowering.  The vegetables are a welcomed change of pace from the usual orange chicken than is just deep fried chicken in a sugary sauce.  I do miss the spicy kick of the orange chicken recipes that have red and black peppers, but I also realize that would screw up THIS recipe because it would overpower the other flavors.  I feel like I am eating healthier when I am eating this dish from Pai Wei and yet I am satisfying my craving for orange chicken.  Overall, I am satisfied with this experience.  You pay a little more for this orange chicken than you might at Tott's or Panda Express but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is not your typical Chinese restaurant, in fact, they view and market themselves as a Asian Bistro.  So depending on your tastes, you will either enjoy their version of your favorite dish, or not.

We came here last night and ordered a bunch of our favorite dishes and left feeling that there was a new choice in the Northsight corridor. 

The area, for those not familiar with the Raintree exit from 101, is a mixture of Kohls, Walmart, Costco, Whole Food, et cetera; along with some quick food options like NYPD, Paradise Bakery, Al's Beef, Luke's, Asian Island and more.

We came around five-forty or so, and found the seating area full, but with some openings.  Two couples were ahead of us in line, but they had three cashier stations taking orders, so our wait was short.

The three of us ordered, a bowl of the Hot & Sour soup for $4.95; six Pork Egg Rolls for $7.25 to share; a Spicy Korean (Chicken) with noodles for $8.25; Mongolian Chicken with rice for $8.25 and a soft drink for $1.85.  The damage came to $30.55, plus tax.

Now, I've eaten Asian food all over the world and I've never had a Spicy Korean (see photo) before last night. I know my Korean friends and relations would not recognize it as Korean. There is no Bulgogie or Kimchi served at Pei Wei, though the noodles might remind you of Kalgooksoo.  But, the dish was good.  Four star good, as the review indicates.

The Mongolian dish (see photo) is similar to the Garlic and Scallions dish you would find in most Szechuan restaurants.  It's as good as any we've had before. 

The Hot and Sour soup is also a winner and is easily recognizable. What  does  Pei Wei not serve?  Well, General Tao's chicken, pan fried dumplings, the afore mentioned Korean dishes, dim sun, and Pho of any kind.  I could go on.

The food is good, if you look past the name and accept the general Asian-ness of what is being offered. 

One shout-out to Adrian, who acted as the dinning room Server/Clearer. He was great and very responsive in getting additional items for us!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Went there for lunch with my gf; decent selection, she got fried rice, and I got the orange peel chicken. They weren't very busy (lunch time), but we still waited about 15 minutes to be served, however the staff was friendly. Ingredients were fresh."}
{"text":"Rice was dry chicken in the Kung pow was overcooked. I would not recommend this dish at this place again"}
{"text":"Not quite fast food as unlike Panda Express everything is made to order instead of being served up from a large tray of pre-made entrees and rice and noodle dishes. Good selection and value, love the Coke dispenser with tons of choices. Trying the spicy Polynesian Poke Bowl, WOW, I have a new favorite item to order. It was so good."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here in the food. Quick service but not fast food. Love the crab puffs and lettuce wraps. Can make a meal on those alone. Also love the Coke machine with the variety of flavored. I need one of these at home!!!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed here.  We had the BOGO offer this time and was thrilled to have a discount.  Usually hard to get those types of deals here.  It was crazy busy, but we still got our meal within very good time.  Food is very consistent.  I love their soda machine!!  Prices are quite reasonable.  I hope they keep sending more coupons so I can come back more often."}
{"text":"We found this to be very average. The new sushi menu items are overpriced and tasted bland. The Pad Thai Chicken tasted burned. We have been here in the past and thought it was very good. However, this visit and the last few have been a good representation to us that this location has lowered it's standards."}
{"text":"There is a very unprofessional and educated manager by the name of Jennifer.  Most importantly we called to complain about the disgusting food that was given to us. After numerous times eating at different Pei Wei and at PF Changs. This idiot said that she prepare the food herself and which she did not. In any event we called to complain about the disgusting food and she automatically started yelling saying she's not going to reimburse my money for the disgusting food that that store produced. Well cunt I did not ask for the money first of all we wanted it replaced. But being after that you were yelling and screaming like a fat ass lunatic that you are I did want my money back. But to other people if you want gross food and going to be treated like shit and not get your own money back I do not suggest this place whatsoever this is my third time going there and will be the last. And I did have the privilege to record her that I will be sending to corporate headquarters."}
{"text":"Well there's nothing wrong with the food except they are constantly running out of things at dinner time. Also don't even bother calling in or ordering your food online because you're still going to have to wait for 30 minutes for it to be cooked once you arrive. Safe to say I won't be wasting my time here anymore after this has happened multiple times now."}
{"text":"Chain Schmain!  

Pei Wei is awesome. At Pei Wei I can spend less than $10 and have a great lunch, bring my dog, relax and read a book in the shaded patio AND get myself unlimited refills of fountain drinks.  BTW, when you have access to a good soda fountain, do yourself a favor and mix in a little soda water with your diet coke. You can't taste the difference and it's much healthier for you.  

According to my calculations, I have been here about 84 times now and my favorites are the Pad Thai with chicken and the sesame beef."}
{"text":"This location is close to my house and my Gym! The gal that took my order tonight was very professional and kind. You could tell she liked her job and was happy to be there! My food came out exactly as I ordered it and in a timely manner! Not my 1st time in and won't be my last! See you next time!"}
{"text":"Where should I start?! I do not know what is wrong with Pei Wei these days.  I ordered on line take out of 2 regulars extra spicy w/extra sauce on the side.  It certainly seems simple enough and the order confirmation was correct.  When we got home, there were 2 smalls w/zero sauce on either order.  The requested \"extra\" sauce was provided, fortunately, as this was the only sauce we had for our meals.  The sauce containers were placed ON THEIR SIDE in the bag - fortunately the lids were on tight.  I can only imagine if they had leaked!  There was ZERO flavor, let alone any detectable spice, thank goodness for Sriracha and/or hot chili oil.  The rice was not the \"normal\" rice.  It had a strange texture and tasted like \"Uncle Ben's\" converted rice.  Additionally, there were virtually no vegetables in either meal and one of my snap peas had something very hard and crunchy (I'm fortunate to have very strong teeth) - don't know if it was dirt or ??? along with a very few tasteless pieces of chicken that were breaded and dry instead of wok seared as usual. 

It seems the more complex Pei Wei's menu becomes, the more their food suffers.  Perhaps it's just too many dishes for the constantly changing cooks to remember.  When Pei Wei first opened the menu was pretty simple, flavorful and consistent in quality.  Now it's a roll of the dice as to what you'll actually receive.  Perhaps Pei Wei needs to return to the basics that made them successful, bring back some of the removed favorites and concentrate on having fewer dishes that are satisfying, tasty and quality consistent.  It will be quite some time before we order from Pei Wei, again, if ever.  I value my money too much to squander it on one disappointment after another."}
{"text":"Always on point. I get the Carmel chicken.. The crab wontons are a guilt must have. And I love there  tea too. Ate her for two years and always pleased. Thx!"}
{"text":"Okay so before i say anything i want to point out i understand it can get busy but there are no excuses in this circumstance. I had gone in after work to get some quick take out food. Being reasonable i expected a 10-15 min maximum wait since there were a few people before me. I got a small plate of noodles and chicken with shrimp and was standing there waiting for 26 minutes! What made things more irritating was the guy who came in after me got his food before me and he had 4 trays of food!!! I paid nearly $12 for my small plate and a drink and had i not already paid i would have left. Finally when i got my food i went home and opened it up to see it was 3/4 of the way full lengthwise, almost all the noodles had no sauce on them and there were 3 very small pieces of chicken and 2 med pieces of shrimp. It wasnt even enough to fill the bowl. Very disapointed. However the staff was friendly but it didnt make up for everything else."}
{"text":"I do love Chinese food, and for such a big city I find that Phoenix (or at least Scottsdale) lacks in options, either because they aren't the most welcoming of places, or simply because there aren't that many (compared to sushi restaurants for example. I've been to this location maybe 3 times since moving to Phoenix (8 years ago) and must say that I usually go because a friend as a \"Pei Wei\" craving. I found the food to be ok, but I'm typically one who doesn't like spicy food as I find it takes away instead of enhances the flavor. I wasn't too hungry and decided to take the chicken fried rice. I have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from Tottie's in Scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day. Portion was ok though the fried rice was a little sweet and the person I was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn't too bad either. Service was disappointing as our food took about 10 minutes to come, but I must say the staff was helpful when I was asked where to get takeaway boxes as well as a takeaway cup. I'd give it 4 stars if after a handful of experiences I had Pei-Wei on my \"must have\" list but with Pita Jungle, Sack's , Subway, Rubio's, etc. nearby, the competition for \"fast casual\" is stiff and Pei Wei just doesn't cut it for me unless I really had a craving for Asian food that day."}
{"text":"I've been getting take out here every week for the past several months and I've been very happy with the service, timeliness, food quality, and customer service.  Be sure to sign up for a pei Wei rewards account and enjoy a free entry on frequent occasion.  I've had everything on the menu and have enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Always order the same thing and when I got my order tonight it was different. I called and the girl on the phone said for sure that's what it is because she bagged it herself. Well instead of offering to fix it she just told me she was really sorry. Well, sorry doesn't pay for the $9 dish I didn't order"}
{"text":"We don't have Pei Wei in northern California so when I'm visiting AZ or SoCal I make it a goal to stop at a Pei Wei somewhere. Yes, I'm addicted to the kung pao chicken and I'm proud to admit it. I've been eating at Pei Wei for the past 10 years and have never deviated from my order. Crazy huh?

Here's why it's a solid option. It's quick, flavorful and all the proteins are cooked in a wok with a ton of oil :) Flash frying in a pan, yessssss please! As I mentioned above, I only ever order the kung pao chicken and it's consistently great across all the locations. I've never just had an OK kung pao. It comes with a ton of white meat chicken, carrots, snow peas, brown rice and a great sauce. I would recommend ordering the extra vegtables too (mostly broccoli). 

I'm in AZ for the next few days and I gauruntee that I'll be getting some more kung pao before I bounce. Boom."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei but not this one.  The selections are different and the food just doesn't taste as good.  I always regret stopping at this one.  It's worth driving to Bell instead.  I also noticed they pour the same soy sauce into both the low sodium and regular bottles."}
{"text":"I placed an order over the phone about an hour and fifteen minutes ago, was told when my order would be ready which was in about twenty minutes. Get there and they can not find me in the system then go oh yeah I remember you called in and placed an order go to re enter the order making me wait longer and late for work then messed up the order ."}
{"text":"While I generally love Pei Wei was extremely disappointed in the service today.   I usually frequent the one on McClintock buy won't come back to this one. I had a gift card and the manager refused to accept it.  I didn't know he was was the manager so when I asked to speak to the manager he said he was the manager and  was not going to make any accommodations. It was clearly their card but he would not accept it. He not only lost a customer in me but my family.  This location would have been convenient to my new office but I won't be back. What happened to service???  I haven't even had a chance to order as he was so rude. It's too bad."}
{"text":"I decided to try it out, I'm celiac and therefore can only eat gluten free...
They have an easy to understand GF Menu with anything you can possibly want.

I placed my order online and picked the exact pickup time. I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami!

I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again! I did see a huge line at the store, so try doing an online order and pickup forsure!

p.s. they even include GF soy sauce!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of my lunch destinations.  I usually order Orange Peel Tofu and Vegetables or The Spicey Korean with Tofu.  The portions are huge and I usually get brown rice as my choice of rice.  Pei Wei is fast.  The orders come out of that kitchen very quickly.  Their ice tea is excellent.  You can choose from Mandarin Orange or Chai.  They have sliced oranges and lemons for tea. (A nice touch)

Three stars people."}
{"text":"Horrible food.  The hot and sour soup was fine, but my main entree was so disappointing.  Never going back.  Can't believe PF Chang's tarnishes their image with this place."}
{"text":"I usually go here because it's PF Chang's adopted brother, good enough to be in the family picture, not quite good enough to be in the will. They have all the basic tastes you would expect and a cost friendly price.

Went here today because I had a buy one get one free entree...got the Thai Basil and it was basi-ly. Good portions, good zest and came out within 5 minutes. I had originally ordered two entrees of the Thai Basil, but then I had buyer's remorse and asked to change my selection after the order already had been put it in....but the lady was super nice and did it without hesitation - EXCELLENT service, thank you for going the extra mile. The other entree was the Spicy Korean, which I usually get with beef, but it was surprisingly spicy and tangy with the chicken. Good twist. 

anyways, I always love to share a good deal so if you want in with the coupon, it expires this Thursday and anyone can use it at their local pei wei....here's how:

{"text":"Horrible!! Ordered for pick up and got my husband the sesame chicken and there was shrimp mixed in with the chicken. He is allergic to shrimp! I also bought a drink and their freestyle machine was not working and had no drinks available so I ended up throwing away my cups and leaving. I would not recommend anyone to go here. This place sucks!"}
{"text":"First time I came here there was a hair in my food. Manager was quick to have it remade and gave me two $5 gift cards as an apology. On my second visit I find out that the two gift cards EXPIRED and they made my good wrong. Of course my group was waiting on me so I cancelled my order so we could leave. No words of apology from the manager. Totally ignored by him. I'm never returning here. I'll spend my lunch money elsewhere and encourage our office to lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great fast cooking Asian menu. Hot or cold food chemically and physically. My fav is the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad. For a little kicked up performance, ask for a small serving of pot sticker sauce, then mix in i spoon red pepper, one spoon ginger, several drips of vinegar and hot oil (all of these ingredients are found at the service bar except the pot sticker oil you will have to ask a server for) and mix it all up. It's a great concoction you will love to kick things up. Generals chicken is also a fav."}
{"text":"Do NOT call in by phone. They won't answer. On two occasions, I've spent 30+ minutes waiting because there was one person answering phones, bagging, and placing orders.

I'll be bringing my business elsewhere. I used to go here weekly. You either need to staff the front with more people or figure out another solution. There is no reason why one person should have to do all of that work themselves."}
{"text":"I have always loved Pei Wei as I'm an asian food lover from the SF Bay Area and I definitely have a sense for what's good and what's not.  Some might question the authenticity of their food, and I'm not asian so I don't consider myself to be an authority.  I do, however, LOVE the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu and everytime I order it, I'm in heaven :)  The portion is huge, seriously enough for 2-3 meals, the flavor is excellent, it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles, the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a fabulous texture.  The crushed peanuts, lime and cilantro create a party in my mouth!!!

You just can't beat the overall quality, service and price.   It makes joints like Panda Express look embarrassing by comparison.  I like the fact that Pei Wei also rotates in new menu items (Sesame Chicken is new) and you can order brown rice as an option."}
{"text":"To all my friends and family or whoever may go to Pei Wei on 1619 North Dysart Rd. Please reconsider! My family and I were dining at this Pei Wei yesterday and observed the General Manager working the food line. For 30 minutes this man picked a pimple on the back of his ear and poked at his nose then touched food. We were grossed out to say the least and got a refund. He came to our table to let us know he wasn't bleeding so we shouldn't be worried. Really dude? How about the puss or gunk you squeezed out of that pimple and the sweat and mucus you touched picking your nose. He never got why we were so disgusted because he just kept assuring us his pimple wasn't bleeding. I think he even sniffed his fingers to see if the back of his ear stunk. We ended up at Takamatsu by Luke Air force Base and had better food and a better experience. I just wanted to share this so you can decide if you want to dine at this location but I don't recommend it. *barf*"}
{"text":"This location is gross! Every table is dirty, floor is gross. The employees are not friendly! Food was gross. Never will return. Owners need to be fired for allowing this!"}
{"text":"I struggle with giving them 4 stars... not sure why.  Maybe it is the whole corporate entity thing.  I am a fan of local restaurants.  So what brought me here was a team lunch with my coworkers.  I had the Mongolian beef with brown rice... this was pretty tasty my only complaint would be that some of the pieces of beef were kind of fatty.  Everyone on my team seemed to enjoy their food.  So I would say for some quick Asian inspired food in a nice environment this would be a good option.  But if you are looking for something a little more impressive I would stick to locally owned restaurants and avoid the chains."}
{"text":"Women's bathroom smells terrible, is dirty. Fried potstickers are nasty. Table was dirty, worker said he'd come clean it, never did."}
{"text":"went with my husband today everything was delicious we order Dan Dan  noodles and the Polynesian Bowl  very fresh will definitely come back :) love it"}
{"text":"We kept seeing the commercials for the wei better orange chicken so we went to try it out. This was our 1st time at this location and 2nd time eating at Pei Wei. The orange chicken Did Not look like the orange chicken in the commercial. We both had the wei better orange chicken, my husband had noodles and I had lettuce wraps; which was a wedge of ice berg, and shared shrimp fried rice. The food was mediocre, chicken was $5 about what it was worth. The worse part was the filthy dinning room and patio. Several tables left dirty, one of the girls would bring a tub place dirty dishes and leave it sit on the table. The floors were Absolutely disgusting, from the black grime on the the red floor it was obvious they had not been clean. The patio tables were just as dirty, the rail next to the tables were sticky and gross, bugs on the tables and dried on sticky food/sauce. No one in the restaurant was concerned about cleaning the tables."}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei.  Just tasty, ALWAYS.  

This location is very easy to get to and cool that you can take it all to go.

Service has been pretty good every time I have gone here."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I live on the other side of Vegas and going to Pei Wei was suppose to be a treat. But the veggies were old and wilted. My middle were mush. I won't be back. We got the pad Thai and orange beef. Both were terrible. The edename and crab wontons were good."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is semi-fast food, it's not gourmet but it doesn't pretend to be. Its like PF Chang's slightly goofy little brother- its got the same basic ideas and ingredients, but its not as refined. But it doesnt want to be.

That said, I like it when I want something fast to pick up after work that I know will be a good decent meal for the money. Last night I got Blazing noodles with chicken (JD's fav) and some chicken fried rice. For 14 bucks and change we had enough food for an 80's movie food fight even after we were finished eating. Were our taste buds blown away by amazing flavor and pizzaz? Heck no, but we were happily satisfied,  carb loaded and ready to drift off to dreamland with a slight odor of soy sauce in the air."}
{"text":"It's a Sunday. The last day of the weekend. I get that most people don't want to cook.  Either they are not familiar with being busy or they are just really slow. The table next to us waited over an hour for sweet and sour chicken that was made wrong the first time. The table we sat at also bad not been cleaned off or wiped down. My husband and I waited over 20 minutes for 4 cold crab wontons and then about another 20 minutes for our main entrees. They also did not have any clean forks out. I had asked the girl if we could get 2 forks when she gets a chance. She said sure and then never returned. The manager had seen that the forks cannister was empty and put a forks cannister up on the counter. She saw and looked at us and never came back with forks. I would have veen fine if the manager had come over and apologized for the wait and offered a buy one get one or whatever. Nothing. He was handing out gift cards to other tables like they were candy."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, friendly staff and very clean. Food is usually served quickly and I like sitting at the chef's counter to watch them cook everything. Kung pau chicken and Mingolion been with fried or brown rice are great. New options are added occasionally. Good for dine in or takeout."}
{"text":"We really like this restaurant. The food is fresh and cooked to your order. Yummy!
Wifey has a tender tummy. She was wanting some real food. Sweet and sour tofu fit the bill. Now she is happy and satisfied. Yeah!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed many a great meal at our Henderson location.  Tried the Lo Mein a few nights ago...delicious.  It's my new favorite dish.  Can't wait to stop by again for yet another great meal soon...."}
{"text":"The ahi avocado salad is the best I just love the wasabi vinegertte it comes with so tasty. I personally don't like ginger so I get it without. I can eat this salad every day :) love it so much"}
{"text":"Used to like this place. It's been a while since I've been there and after tonight, don't think I'll be going back again. The plates are smaller, the portions are smaller, nothing is spicy anymore. It's all sweet. Even the pei wei spicy is a sweet dish. And the chicken used to be substantial chunks of chicken. Now it's mostly just fried batter covered on a sweet sauce. Hardly any chicken at all."}
{"text":"If you order online or over the phone,  beware. This location is SO completely disorganized. There were at least 8 people ordering in the store,  and only me at the take out.  Only ONE person was taking orders. I could see my meal sitting on the counter without a lid getting cold for at least 5 min. Then still had to wait for my crab wontons."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and delicious. Cooked to order, and of a higher quality than you would imagine a quick service restaurant. The staff is gracious and hospitable; and the manager takes pride of ownership."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The menu is varied and they will customize any dish for you.  They have great vegetarian options.  I love their  tofu and veggies.  I usually order the sauce on the side.  My favorite dish is tofu and veggies over fried rice.  The portions are large.  If you check the nutritional stats on their website most of the dishes are 2 servings, which is nice to know if you are counting calories, but not so nice when you know that you've chowed down the whole dish because it's so delish.  They also have a gluten free menu and a kids menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really gone down hill. Tonight I ordered online at 6:05 for a 6:45 pick up. Order wasn't ready until after 7:00. Got home and 2 of the 4 items I ordered were messed up. The sauce was missing from the crab wonton appetizer and there were onions in my orange beef that I ordered removed. Our meal was really just disappointing. We ordered here about a month ago and had similar problems. I was hoping this was a one time issue but I guess that is not the case."}
{"text":"Terrible. When I arrived at 6pm. There were 30 people waiting in the To-Go line and no one in the dine-in line. I was dining in. I noticed 6 cooks. I waited 30 minutes before receiving my food. The vegetable spring roll was greasy, fried and tasteless.  The coconut curry chicken was pasty tasting with cold starchy rice. I have been to other Pei Wei with better food and service. I do not recommend this restaurant. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"East meets west. It's not authentic but is appealing for a quick, fresh lunch. I like the pad thai extra spicy."}
{"text":"Yeah, probably not coming back to this location again. Normally I don't have a problem with Pei Wei but I just wasn't in the mood for a sh1tty lunch experience today and that's exactly what I got. Came here after my kid's swim class. Line of about six people waiting at lunch, no big deal but the reason the line was so long turned out to be that the guy at the register was as slow as molasses. Second thing I noticed was that it was absolutely FREEZING cold inside. It wasn't a particularly warm day outside anyway, but inside it was almost arctic. I'd guess 65° or lower. Insane. Finally got to place our orders. Slow as god damn molasses. Like the sloth at the DMV in Zootopia. One of my items was a side of their PW spicy sauce. Got drinks and sat to wait. Out comes the food, cooked properly. Server asks if it's all good, I said no, waiting on my side of PW spicy sauce since that didn't come out. He goes away and you guessed it, no sauce. I then look at the receipt and sure as shinola it's not even listed on there. Not worth asking for it a third time.

I'll be doing their survey for sure. And next time we'll be going to the Grayhawk location which is far better.

Nothing wrong with the food though (apart from not acknowledging/delivering all the items), which is why they get 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Ugh, this place is terrible!  It looks good, and it smells good, but it unfailingly ALWAYS disappoints!  I seriously have not had one dish that tasted close to right.  Its salty and very flavorful, but somehow it just tastes off.  I've tried a lot of dishes here too."}
{"text":"I placed an online order through Theo group ordering system and loved the ease of the transaction,"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a less  expensive version of P.F. Changs.  Most of them deliever and the food is better than your average Chinese take-out.  Chicken lettuce wraps and egg rolls are great options."}
{"text":"What the heck happened to Pei Wei? This used to have awesome food. I had the California Mango roll and my guess is it was made 2 days ago and refrigerated. How can you mess up  C-roll? I'll tell u - don't cook the rice completely and then don't add flavor and then serve it says later. My husband had the sweet and sour chicken and the quality of meat was sub-par and grisly. I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a fave, always- but this location is the best I have visited. They are extremely attentive, food is spot on, never slow dining in or late on pick up orders. 

The staff is all really friendly & helpful. The entire atmosphere is casual & very cleanly- even the drink/condiment/dinnerware area was attended to frequently while being kept stocked & tidy. I brought an out of town guest with me & was really pleased to have chosen this because the meal & experience was great- the perfect casual evening. 

Only thing- we were confused on if we were supposed to bus our own table before leaving. Being as how most everything else is self-serve (including to-go boxes since you pay as you order before seating yourself- staff only waits on you to bring food & check on you- very casual), we didn't know if we should have taken our plates to clear & stack them or leave them on the table. Did not want to be rude!"}
{"text":"I really love Pei Wei, and generally have a good experience at this location. I usually always order to-go, and my order is almost always ready with no wait time when I show up. 

The only thing lacking, is the consistency of orders. Sometimes they really lack in providing more than tiny, skimpy portions for to-go orders. Other times, you get more than what is expected! It just seems to vary each time. And they often run out of cookies or certain other items, which is frustrating. 

But overall, they are really good and easy to order with! The food quality is almost always up to par, and I love being able to redeem points for my orders, as well as always being offered a water if I have to wait for my order to finish, even if it is my fault for arriving a little early. 

This is a place I will continue to give business to. They have really good food for a very decent cost and are always friendly and trying to make it a good experience. It is appreciated, I just wish they would be a little more attentive with consistency of orders when it comes to the portions & some of the quality/presentation."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gave them two chances. I wish we hadn't. Both times the food tasted...off. I won't hasten to guess the reason of the \"offness\", but I had to stop eating the food both times for fear of becoming ill."}
{"text":"Tried something new today... first a Roast Pork Egg roll and then Spicy Korean Chicken. Now perhaps I am a bit of a Chinese (Asian) food snob being from NY NY however one thing you can take to the bank is this... DO NOT GET THE ROAST PORK EGG ROLL. Hands down the weakest by far I have ever had!  So surprising as I have never known Pei Wei to have anything terrible and this my friends was terrible. 

OK, now the Spicy Korean Chicken.  Really just OK. While beautiful looking and presented, flavor wise... just mediocre.  Left feeling that something was missing... like perhaps a tinge more sweetness. 

While tonight's meal will by no means preclude me from coming back, I certainly learned tonight what Not to order."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good, the portions are large and staff are always friendly. The Spicy Chicken and Kung Pow are some of my favorites. I typically prefer hole-in-the-wall Asian spots but this is a safe bet."}
{"text":"If you are gluten free, BEWARE!  Do not be fooled by the gluten free menu.  There have been a number of gluten free diners who have gotten ill after eating here, and at least two (that I know of) who believe they have been served gluten after ordering gluten free.  If a restaurant is going to offer a gluten free menu, then they need to ensure that their staff is trained.  They need to show clear evidence of cross contamination procedures.  Our family used to eat here regularly and we finally gave up.  It wasn't safe for us.   We now eat at Tott's, which doesn't have a gf menu, but has been very accommodating."}
{"text":"I love the variety Pei-Wei offers from Sushi, to Hot & Sour soup! This visit I tried their Light Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I was able to request Teriyaki sauce for the chicken instead of the Kung Pao. I also tried their Crab wontons which were delicious with the sauce. Their edamame appetizer is a great little add-on. I also ended up trying the Spicy tuna roll as well and those were very good! I will keep coming back its such a great healthy lunch or dinner option. Also, they offer gluten free entrees."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at this restaurant.  I had never had lo mein before ( I thought it was similar to chow mein) and I was unpleasantly surprised.  Not the restaurants fault- I just really didn't like it.  When the manager noticed that I was picking at my food, he asked me if everything was ok.  I told him that I didn't like the noodles so he offered to change it out for me.  All of the people who worked there were very friendly and pleasant, but the manager was really on top of it and I have to give him credit for being observant!!  I wouldn't have went up to complain because I ordered it.  But I wasn't going to eat it and I was kind of surprised at that kind of service! 
Way to go Pei Wei!!"}
{"text":"The food seems to have improved to me lately.  Had the Japanese Teriyaki noodles with veggies and tofu.  Couldn't finish it all and it was yummy.

Thrilled that they have a gluten free menu.

The kids menu is inexpensive and good portions.  Next time my two youngest will share.

My kids were in love with the soda dispenser.  

Top all that off with free wi-fi from paradise bakery next door and 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This location of Pei Wei is always tasty and the service is always friendly. If you are looking for a more affordable version of PF Chang this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei but this location is consistently horrid.  Visit the Summerlin location instead."}
{"text":"I went to the summerlin location on 1/5/15, and ordered same thing I always do. Japanese teriyaki with no carrots. I've been going to pei Wei for years. Not only here, but at my home in Colorado. I know my pei Wei. The chicken in this order was so hard and so dry,it was basically not edible. I ate around it. I used the plastic knife and fork it came with to try cutting the chicken and ended up breaking the fork. I will try again and hope it's better next time."}
{"text":"First timer here and I'm disappointed. I witnessed them mess up a couple online pick up orders (wrong items, wrong person, forgotten items) while waiting for mine ... I should have checked my bag too. All of our items were present but my Kung pao chicken with fried rice ended up being orange chicken with brown rice. It's \"just\" a dollar upcharge, but it was still an extra dollar for an item I did not receive. Supervisor (I'm assuming) was scolding employees about paying attention to what they're doing. Food tastes decent, but not sure if it's worth $8.69 per bowl plus up charge and tax. Not sure if I'll return, either. Panda is across the street, costs less, good customer service, and you get the same amount of food or more. Just disappointed"}
{"text":"I definitely like their sesame chicken over noodles. It is actually the ONLY thing I get so this review is solely based on one dish. Sorry! Try the sesame chicken with noodles lol"}
{"text":"Pei Wei was one of my favorites. Went online to order and pick up last night. The menu has changed and we were not impressed. Ordered 2 noodle bowls, spicy steak and chicken. Don't have the options for different portions anymore.  The food was hot but lack of steak and shrimp!  No vegetables, and only 3 shrimp per bowl. I was highly disappointed and have no plans to go back soon."}
{"text":"If I were to describe tonight's visit in one word it would be 'disappointing'.   We walked in and placed an order for 3 of the new 'wei better' orange chicken entrees and an order of crab wontons to go.  After waiting at a sticky table for 15 minutes we overheard that someone had forgotten to make the third order of orange chicken, and another customer was told they were out of Kung Pao chicken. We finally left 25 minutes after I'd checked in. Once home, we were disappointed with how blah and dry the food tasted.  My husband said it was nothing like the orange chicken he'd had at a different  Pei Wei a few weeks ago.  At least the crab wontons were stellar."}
{"text":"I retract my previous review. I called and spoke to a manager about how my entire takeout order was wrong (missing more than half my items), was told my card would be refunded but never was. Just came in tonight to get a takeout order, the manager was standing there while I explained to the employee that my order was entirely wrong the last time so please take time to bag it this time, instead of apologizing, the manager walked away to lock the restaurant doors before the restaurant was even closed. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here after running errands.   First ordered Orange Chicken, but it was a little spicy for my palette and my tongue began to tingle which is a sign for me that I can't have it. The waitstaff was amazing and took it back without blinking a eye.  He even recommended  another dish which was perfect. Pei Wei  use to part of PF Changs not sure what happened with the sale of PF Changs.  The food is still good, and I found this restaurant clean and appealing. I had a nice lunch.  Would I come back?  Yes I think I would"}
{"text":"I enjoy PF Chang's, so I was looking forward to trying Pei Wei as it's PF Chang's casual, \"fast-food\" dining chain. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by how the quality of Pei Wei didn't measure up to the PF Chang's standard. I would have at least thought that Pei Wei would have been a step above Panda Express, but nope!

I like the concept of Pei Wei's. It's Chinese fusion food, but the food hasn't been sitting out under heat lamps. The food at Pei Wei is made to order, so it's good to know that your food comes out fresh every time. I ordered the Vietnamese Rice Noodle Salad as my entree and shared the Edamame Hummus and Szechuan Wings among my friends. 

I took a bite of my friend's Japanese Steak & Shrimp Chile Ramen. I was so not impressed by it either. It's a confused dish! It lacked the Japanese flavors entirely and was very heavy on the peanut sauce. It tasted more like a Thai dish, so I thought perhaps it was made incorrectly on accident? 

My Vietnamese Rice Noodle Salad was not good. There was no balance in my dish at all. The chile-lime garlic vinaigrette was way too acidic, which single-handledly ruined the dish for me. I also didn't realize that my chicken was going to be breaded. The menu said the chicken is wok-seared chicken and had no mention of it either being cooked in coconut oil and/or breaded in coconut flour. Again, my dish also lacked any recognizable Vietnamese flavors. 

The Szechuan Wings were crispy and flavorful, but the chicken was super dry. 

The only thing I truly liked was the Edamame hummus. It had a nice, creamy consistency, and the edamame provided a unique flavor to the hummus. I had the hummus with the snap peas and cucumbers. The dish also comes out with bell peppers and wonton chips to dip into the hummus."}
{"text":"Pei Wei has become a favorite \"take out\" spot for both myself and my girl friend.  We drive a little further than the local Taco Bell - KFC combination fast food stop, but to eat healthier it is certainly worth our time. 

Yesterday, after our Silver Crafting Class, we drove the 2.4 miles and not only enjoyed a relaxing healthy lunch, but then purchased \"take home\" orders so we would have our evening meal in the refrigerator waiting.  (I brought my husband home an order of his favorite Kung Po Chicken with brown rice.)  

If you haven't give Pei Wei a try, stop in some time. I believe you'll enjoy it -- that is, IF, you enjoy Asian dishes."}
{"text":"Normally I like Pei Wei but this location needs to keep up with cleaning the tables and clean their filthy soda machines.  Grosss.  Shouldn't take that long to clean tables and I had to sit at a dirty table in order to eat my food because no one came to clean the table. Very dirty. Also having to wait over 40 minutes for a pad Thai is totally unacceptable.  I was unable to eat my lunch because my lunch break was over by the time I got my food. Will never ever go back to a Pei Wei again."}
{"text":"Nice lunch with work colleagues. We were in and out within 1/2hr so perfect for a lunch spot. Everyone enjoyed their meal for fast Asian wok fried dishes. Today we ordered the Kung Pao chicken 4/5, Mongolian beef, Teriyaki shrimp and fried rice and an Ahi avocado salad.

They now have $5 lunch specials like $5 Mongolian Monday, $5 Teriyaki Tuesday and $5 General Tso's Thursday. 

Pei Wei began by the culinary experts at PF Chang's wanting a faster but high quality option for fast asian food. They first opened in 2000 and I have been a loyal customer for years. Some of my favorite dishes are the honey seared chicken, Kung Pao chicken, orange chicken, Korean spicy bowl and the Thai dynamite.

Another plus is they offer a 15% discount to military, wish I knew about this perk years ago!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my last visit here. Ordered for pick up and order was read back correctly. Got all the way home and dressing for the salad was not included. Drove back to get it and was barely acknowledged. Drive home again and found out that the wings were also not in the bag. Gave up at that point. Called the restaurant the next day and the manager said I could drive back over and he would give me a gift card. I said I lived far away and just wanted a refund for the part I did not receive. He said he was too busy to do that but I could call back at another time. Bottom line is that I was too busy to make 3 trips across town for a simple order.  I never got refunded for the error nor did I get the gift card."}
{"text":"For the price the food is great value, portions are good and the staff are very pleasant. Great thing is you can finish off your meal with a Starbucks from next door."}
{"text":"Ordered at 6:25 pm this evening, it's now 6:55 on and still no food, this isn't acceptable I get there's a lot of to go orders but doesn't mean you put the customers waiting in the restaurant till last like I was told by the girl cleaning the tables, won't come back to this location, I will stick to the surprise one where there service and food is better"}
{"text":"My family and I were driving around on a Sunday evening, and we saw this Pei Wei location, and because of a great previous experience at this place, we decided to eat here. It was about half full, but when we ordered it took them 45 minutes just to get our food out for a takeout order. They were extremely understaffed, and by the time we got our food it was lukewarm. Our food tasted ok, but there was an average of one piece of meat in all of our meat dishes.
Food: 3.5
Service: 1"}
{"text":"The chicken dish only had five small nuggets of chicken in it (honey seared), with way too much rice to make up for lack of meat.  The rice was quite dry as well.  Not sure why this location has trouble with the quality of the food, because the one in Gainey is fabulous."}
{"text":"Every time I've go into this location no matter what I want to order they are out of that item, every time.  How does a \"chain\" like this run out...McDonalds does a better job."}
{"text":"Hello everybody!

Well I have Pei Wei on my best vegan for the money for now. I am thinking of removing them due to a very lackluster meal today. It was the usual

Thai Dynamite extra sauce,extra spicy, extra veggies w/brown rice.

Here were the problems, and it seems it may be worse since the run in with the sherriff on the whole worker thing. I will stay out of this discussion Yelp is not the time nor place for that, nor can I say that indeed this is the issue affecting my food. 

First, It was not extra spicy at all. Im not scared of the heat, and I expressly said this when ordering. I was told that it isnt a problem that lots of people order extra spicy, and it would be just that. 

Second, it just did not seem like there were extra veggies. We order this way because we split and it gives both of us a good amount of everything. 

Third, the rice was very dry, and tasted old to me.

Fourth, practically every table in the place was covered in dirty dishes. EW! Maybe there was a staffing issue. At least attempt to clear the tables so folks can sit down and eat. Kinda important!

Review time!

Curbage: -5 (virtually every table was dirty, and we should have gone across the street to Chipotle. This shows the quality of service this day)

P factor: 7 (needed minor attention, no checklist today)

Order waiting time: 9 (very busy but our order was taken quickly)

Ambieance:2 or 3 (hard to want to eat an anticipated meal when the entire patio and dining room tables are covered in dirty dishes)

Food arrival time: 9 (for as busy as it ws our food arrived fairly quickly. I noticed the runners were trying to bus tables also. I believe normally this is not the case here. I will say that this practice is very disgusting and should NEVER be practiced. Do you want your meal brought to you by someone who just bussed another dirty table without washing thier hands before touching your plate. i know i dont.)

Food taste: 8 (even though the rice was very dry and there seemed to be not enough veggies, and it just was not spicy, the flavor was good)

Overall: 5 

Today i am on the fence. Im thinking they were just having a bad day. I like Pei Wei. Until next time

Late!
Gordo"}
{"text":"I don't get why everyone loves this place. Food is not good. Staff is very polite and well trained, which I should give more stars for. Unfortunately, I give it 1 star to offset all the people who seem to get confused by popularity and chain sales. They shadow a terrible product with corporate know how. 

The hot and sour soup tasted like salted soy sauce with a bunch of corn starch. The dan dan noodles were over cooked with no flavor. Nothing like Chinese food. Sesame and orange chicken were overly sweet and salty. This is corporate knowledge that salt and sweet are addictive flavors. They're better off selling overly sweet salty product to get you to keep coming back. I guess it's working because they were busy"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about this place because I was looking for another place but my friend said try this place. Glad I listened to her because the food was awesome. Had the sesame chicken regular size and egg roll. I licked my fingers after and even ate her honey chicken too.

I think this place is awesome and I will totally go there very soon again."}
{"text":"Pei Wei in general is one of my favorite places. This particular location, however, drives me nuts with extremely poor service and mediocre versions of their best dishes. I'm consistently ignored by the staff when I walk in. It's not uncommon to stand at the counter with two employees behind it and be ignored for several minutes before leaving frustrated that none of them can be bothered to even acknowledge your presence. They'll look straight at you, then go back to ignoring you and talking to each other. 

The last successful attempt at ordering food there resulted in me waiting so long for my food, I was about to ask as people behind me had come and gone, and then they handed me my order, which had been sitting out for 15 minutes and was cold.

Long story short, you may get decent food here, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Find another pei Wei. The one in Henderson on sunset is awesome, great service, awesome food."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. My family placed an order to be picked up and were told to be there at 7:20. We get there and I sit waiting for the food until 8! Nobody acted like it was a big deal when I told them and just said \"oh.... Well we are running behind.\" Um okay?! We get home and they forgot to put the crab puffs in my bag. Didn't bother going back and moved on to our meals. My honey glazed chicken was average, edible. My husbands sweet and sour chicken was so soggy it was disgusting! Couldn't even eat it. My daughter loves fried rice and wouldn't even eat hers, it was so greasy. We all ended up eating PB&J's and it was 100x better than anything we brought home."}
{"text":"Last night we ate at this pei Wei. We got there kinda late and when we went to order they were out of the sushi rolls that we wanted. We went ahead and ordered what they had and a meal.  The manager brought part of our food out and apologized again for being out of what we had ordered as well. Asked us what else we would like on the house. The food was excellent as always and the management was more then accommodating. We will defiantly be going back"}
{"text":"This is the worst Pei wei of them all. Was told it would be a 30 minute wait because they had too many to go orders to catch up on. Meantime the dining room was empty with two parties sitting to dine in. How about prioritizing the people eating there??? A prior time we tried to eat there, someone had PUKED in the waiting line on the floor. The girl at the register did nothing about it as each new person in line had to step over it. Poorly managed and poorly staffed"}
{"text":"Wrote this place off already for poor service and incompetent people at the register , got suckered into coming again by family. Sure as shit , screwed up the order again . Every damn time we've come here, the order is messed up. Nobody cares. Get some staff older than junior high so they know how to give a shit about customer service . Never going again"}
{"text":"We go to pei wei frequently and ever since the new reward program rolled out we have been going much more. It's essentially PF changs but cheaper. The crab wontons are delicious- the chili sauce that comes with them is so flavorful. I typically get the Kung pao chicken with fried rice. So much flavor and just enough heat. The staff is helpful. They do make mistakes sometimes but they are always apologetic and willing to correct what was wrong."}
{"text":"Menu is very similar to PF Chang's.  Good quality American Chinese food at reasonable prices.  Order cafeteria style with limited table service."}
{"text":"Tonight pei wei had a serious problem. I called 4 times to place a pick up order. No one answered the phone. I let it ring over 20 times each time I called.  So now as I sit here waiting for my food I see other customers walking in complaining that no one would answer the phone.  I needed to get dinner for my son ...:but it's going to be a long time before I come back. Very disappointed. I have been a pei wei customer for many many years."}
{"text":"The food from here is so inconsistent- I order the same thing every time and this location is convenient for me to stop by on my way home from work. Am considering finding a new location because one time my take out container is brimming with food and the next time it's barely got any protein. Tonight I get home and my Pei Wei Spicy Chicken doesn't have the spicy sauce on it. Not sure what it is but it's not colored and is on the sweet side. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and what a big disappointment!  I like Pei Wei, been to several branches but this is one that I will not go back to.  Our order was taken efficiently but when the food came, the beef dish we ordered was super salty!  So we hailed a server and told her that the dish was too salty.  All she could say was, do you want to have the dish changed?  So we decided to have only one order replaced since we were halfway through eating the other order which came with the fried rice (that we liked) we would changed just one order of the same dish.  We had ordered two.  So she took one dish away and also removed the other dish.  Maybe we had a communicated breakdown (she could barely speak English), but she replaced only one dish.  So why did she take the other dish away too????  She had an angry face and was not happy at all!  Guess my complaint is, we paid for a dish, it got taken away and there was no offer to refund us???  Yes, one order was replaced, which was still too salty but we decided to just let it go.  That's all I have to say about that..."}
{"text":"Twice in 10 days and they've been out of multiple sauces (Thai dynamite and Korean), however, I had to wait for one of the employees to take off her cellphone headphones and actually come to the cash register. Luckily, the cook said \"you might want to go help him.\"

Avoid this location. Go to location in Summerlin. It's much better."}
{"text":"The service was good for my take out order but the food was \"ok\". Given it is a division of PF Changs (which I love), I expected a bit more in terms of flavor and overall food quality. While the food was \"do able in a pinch\", I don't know that I would choose to go there again with other tastier places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"YUM!  As a lover of PF Changs Mongolian Beef, Pei Wei makes a spot on version quickly.

Arriving on a pretty Friday in spring, I was one of the first people in around 11:20, but by noon the place was packed to the gills, the Ballantyne crowd must really like their quick Chinese food, and while this is quick Chinese food, it is of better quality, and along with that a higher cost, than your typical Chinese takeout joint.

Parking lot is a hot mess. Spots are the new norm of slightly larger than a compact spot and you have 90% of the lot as SUV's and minivans, so be prepared to crawl into a back window to get into your car.

You have a combination of people who work nearby and appeared to be on a time constraint and Ballantyne housewives who have nowhere to be and all day to get there.  There is also a small subset of people who have never seen a Coke Freestyle machine before (the same people who start getting their shit together at the ATM once they are in front of the machine and also write checks at the grocery store still).

Inside is LOUD.  There is the clang of the woks, the chairs scraping across the hard floor and folks talking.  LOUD.  Walk along the wall to the counter where you will place your order and get a cup for your drink and a number to put on your table.  Someone will bring your food to you.

The food:
Mongolian Beef with white rice ($9) - Exactly the same as the PF Changs version, only you don't get to see the giant horses on the way in.  It was a nice lunchtime portion, and arrived SMOKING hot to the table.
Snickerdoodle cookie ($1) - soft and snickerdoodly.  
Drink - Coke Freestyle machine - SCORE!  I was very happy with my cherry ginger ale.

I work and live closer to PF Changs, and since they now have lunch portions for very reasonable prices, that include a cup of soup, I will probably not frequent Pei Wei, but should I find myself in the area, I definitely would not hesitate to try some appetizers and get another delicious order of Mongolian Beef."}
{"text":"Yelp....your map is wrong....food was good...remodeling which is needed as the drink area is very crowded...."}
{"text":"What I really did like was the convenience of the to-go option and parking. I was in and out in the matter of 5 minutes. Although it was convenient, the chicken lettuce wraps were bagged without the lettuce cups. I noticed when I got home and ended up just eating it with a spoon. Even then I thought it was too heavy on the sauce and was extremely salty. 

Not bad for a quick dinner, but don't think I would rush to eat here again."}
{"text":"Good food and nice employees. Probably need to watch the soda machine more often. Will definitely eat here again. I had the teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"My one and only complaint is that pei Wei doesn't have a location in or around the uptown area! They need to come closer to the city!! 

I am swooning over the new poke bowl on the menu! I stuffed myself silly with it and wasn't even mad about it, hahaha!! It comes with 3 different kinds of fresh fish and all the fun ingredients that accompany it!! I'm attaching a photo because I can't remember all that was in it!! 

I have also always loved he spicy pei Wei chicken and the staff has always taken special care of my order because I have a peanut/treenuts allergy. 

Plus you get a fortune cookie so... it's awesome!! :)"}
{"text":"This particular location is terrible when it comes to customer service. It took over 30 minutes to get a bowl of rice for lunch!!! If you are short on time do not come here for lunch. This is not the first time that this happens but I guess there is a pattern. This is the last time I'll be stopping for lunch here."}
{"text":"For half the price I'll mix my own sauce. I was introduced to this place 2 years ago, been a fan ever since. Big portion's of your pf favorites for a great price. Food is always fresh and tasty. Management and staff are always polite and keep the place clean. For the same price as the heat lamped crud at panda you could have a dish that'd freshly prepared."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the reviews on here about this restaurant it's actually not a dine in type of restaurants more fast food think Panda Express better-quality prices are about the same as if you were to go sit down at a restaurant the only problem with that was I was not dressed up I did not want to go into a restaurant I wanted something fast so since this was on the way to Costco we decided to grab something here it was fast the lady that was working there I didn't get her name she came and cleaned our table without is asking and brought us utensils even thou they were on the counter next to the soda fountains...the food was similar to another restaurant portions were big i took my left overs home food was descent rice a bit dry and the bangkok peanut noodles had a strong peanut butter taste and only a couple pieces of chicken.
To break it down good fast service ..food a bit overpriced for a fast food but when time is essential rather here than panda express and portions are filling ."}
{"text":"Payway it's a really good tasting place I like the orange chicken and Mongolian beef I recommend this place to Chinese food lovers"}
{"text":"I placed an order to go. The cashier was nice enough. However, our order took way to long! Several folks were served their food prior to us. My chicken pad tai tasted like ammonia with chewy, sparse chicken.  It was uneatable!
My son loves Pei Wei, but this will likely be our last trip in."}
{"text":"First time here.  They have light choices & you can customize your dish!  Lots of spicy sauce  & protein choices!  Something for everyone in your group!  I ordered steamed veggies with tofu and brown rice and it was not only delicious but healthy too!  The veggies were cooked just right, still crunchy and yet soft enough???  The broccoli sauce that accompanied the veggies had some broccoli stalks and light and not too salty, slight thickened and browned with soy sauce.  For what I paid, around $8.00, I had a nice hearty healthy meal and I could eat only half of it so I will eat it again tomorrow for lunch!"}
{"text":"I have to say that today Pei Wei has perfected the Chicken Broccoli and Sesame Chicken today. Great flavor! Also special props to the Expo who ran the food. Hes keeping the place clean and tidy"}
{"text":"Ah yes (...at least I didn't say 'Ah so'), but ah yes, I can see how the parent company of this pan-Asian fast food franchise outlet is P.F. Chang's. It definitely felt like a cut above a Panda Express but still very much a highly commercialized operation that's been put into the Chipotle blender. A colleague of mine smartly chose this place close to the office knowing how sensitive I was being about my nutritional intake. It was downright bustling at the lunch hour, and there was definitely a mall food court vibe about the menu. It was a smorgasbord of all flavors the average culinary layman would associate with the Far East. 

There was a bit of Vietnam (salad rolls), a smidge of Tokyo (sushi), a swath of Chiang Mai (pad thai), Chinese takeout for the masses (chow mein), and all strange hybrid points in between (mango California rolls anyone?). I zeroed in on the salad bowls where I landed on the $7.99 Ahi Avocado Salad, a scoop of ahi tuna poke surrounded by avocado, their 'Asian' slaw, cucumbers, pickled ginger, mixed greens, toasted sesame seeds, and of course, the obligatory crispy wontons (photo: http://bit.ly/2njaXiG). It was fresh tasting but only moderately committed to satisfying the palate. It's a cuisine I dub P.F. Changlish.

FOOD - 3 stars...Chipotle given a Far East Changlish twang
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...truly mallish
SERVICE - 2.5 stars...not much beyond taking the order
TOTAL - 3 stars...yep, P.F. Changlish"}
{"text":"There are many things I can mention to make businesses like this better, but being that it's a big chain (which is as usual) they loose their touch in total customer care and quality of food! I'm a big fan of mom & pops who are above an belong the quality you would get at a chain store.

The dishes wet about all average with the little flare of adding rice pop chips to their dishes. The seasons is on point their sushi are very poor with quality tho yelled we're on a budget. They most memorable moment was the curious hostess who helped bring out food to the table and even getting us condiments when asked. Their cashiers were not knowledgeable with their choices and options.. They are driven by their options of food the corp offers. Over all it's a-okay.. And nothing amazing to revisit again."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and fairly priced. All the salads are superb. I especially like the Pei Wei Spicy chicken salad. For dieters, they also have lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Don't EVER come eat here. Terrible food, terrible service and oh, did i mention it's an awful place?? It was a waste of my money, plus they treat their employees like absolute trash. These managers don't know how to run a place or treat employees like human beans. Save yourself the time and money and go elsewhere. You can thank me later boo"}
{"text":"Quick and good quality. I had the coconut curry shrimp and really enjoyed it - pretty spicy:)"}
{"text":"I called in to Pei Wei to get take out tonight and the phone was answered by a boy named Dylan. Dylan had a horrible attitude and was not customer service oriented. I was almost going to cancel my order but I changed my mind because I didn't want to waste food. I'm going to avoid this location as much as possible. If he's able to talk to customers like that and it flys by management then I'd rather take my business next door where they are always respectful and extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I swung by here a little while back on super bowl sunday. It was the only Thai place open after 9pm. Nice.  They have a nice east asian fusion menu with plenty of spice and brown rice to boot. Prices are spot on. Plenty of room for parking, dining-in and chatting it up. The Pei Wei has my vote."}
{"text":"Most miserable experience of my life!! I ordered my food to go and when I got home and started eating it I found a cockroach in my food! My friend also started looking through his food and found more insect legs in his dish and immediately got sick. The manager did not care about the situation instead he just refunded me and said \"I don't know what else you want me to do. I would give you gift cards but you probably don't want that.\" They should be shut down! Who knows how many people have eaten insects today with their meal!"}
{"text":"This is the best pei wei I've ever been to. 

The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The managers that have come through have always been the best of the best. When I've been having a bad day and I come in the atmosphere and the employees always make my day better."}
{"text":"I love going to Pei Wei because I can get my Asian fix and I know it will be good.  Lots of options but the best is you can now get any dish made as a salad.

Also I love using the mobile app to order.  It is ready when I arrive, and is a huge time saver."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I usually love coming here for a quick good bite but unfortunately this time was not so pleasant. They seemed understaffed and extremely busy which is fine. What was upsetting was that we stood waiting with no one in front of us to place an order very patiently for around 10-15 minutes. Mean while what I can only assume is the manager is talking to one of the cooks. Once said cook pointed us out the manager turned back around, glares at us, then went back to what she was doing. A couple minutes go by and she finally comes up to ask us what we would like. But by that time we felt as if we were an inconvenience and decided it was best to go somewhere else. Hopefully this isn't a regular occurrence because like I originally stated we do like coming here. 

Now to add to this review on 3/28/18

We decided to try it out again! This time we tried calling in an order for dinner. The first call I was on hold for 10 minutes for someone to finally pick up and then hang up on me. I decided \"ok.. I'll try again..\" this time I was on hold for upwards to 15 minutes with no answer. We were at Walmart shopping so we figured we'll just stop by and order take out. We'll when we arrived I noticed they weren't very busy and I asked the individual taking our order if the phones were down and he replied \"no, I honestly didn't hear the phone ringing\" which I find hard to believe. We proceeded to order our food, left about 15 minutes later. Shame on me for not checking our food prior to leaving because they had messed up on our rice order and the beef in our pei wei beef plate looked as if it was cooked the day before and frozen to be re cooked the next day. It was rubbery, dark grey and pretty gross looking. Again, I've never had an issue with food quality or service at ANY OTHER location in Arizona. Just seems to be this place that is just poorly run. Hopefully they get some new management in there to bring it back up to their normal standards. Unfortunately I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered some food to-go and my order wasn't right so I came back. The manager, alex I believe,was very understanding about the fact that I was upset about having to come back so he compensated for my time. This experience wont keep me from coming back. The food was good as usual"}
{"text":"The dirtiest I mean dirtiest pei  wei I have ever visited.
The floors!
The bathroom!
The outside eating area!
It's hard to look past all of the gross dirtiness to focus on the sweet people.
If this is what is like in the eye of a customer eating lunch just looking around.
How about the kitchen?
Where not much is expected. Not much is given.  

Sad Pei Wei use to be Bomb every one of them!!

Disappointing can't even write about the food because of this!!

Food update!!!
Not good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a diehard Pei Wei addict for about 5 years now. I pretty much get the same thing every time - 2 Spring Rolls and a Pad Thai with Chicken. And despite other reviews, the pricing is TOTALLY reasonable as a Pad Thai with chicken can easily feed two people. 

And speaking of the Pad Thai.. this is hands down the best one I think I've ever had. And I've tried quite a few all over the Valley. This location is great although my favorite (and less busy) is the one located a few miles north of this one in The Summit shopping plaza.

In fact, I think I'll be getting it for lunch today!"}
{"text":"There was an issue with my lunch because of it I would normally give them a one star. However their manger Kevin was awesome and handled it ever well. If and that's a strong if I go back it will only because of his awesome service"}
{"text":"Don't bother with anny of the \"sushi\" especially the mango sushi. Portions are smaller than store bought with no flavor and the mango, ........What mango? Ya need a microscope to locate it. The Pad Thai is flavorful. I had mine with chicken and it was moist and juicy and the noodles were not overcooked. The green onions need to be sliced instead of simply throwing in large chunks into the dish."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this location today. Impressed with the service. My entree came out and the server was not happy with the amount of chicken I was given. He told me he was going to get me more, they ended up making me a whole other entree on the house! Very nice! I was happy with the amount of chicken I received but they went above and beyond my expectations. Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"I tried calling in while driving, was on hold for 20 min and no one ever picked up. I walked in an asked if the phones were down they said no they just weren't answering because they were short staffed. None of the menu screens were on so I had to search for the last menu to order because the paper ones were missing. There were maybe 3 tables of people in the restaurant so being too busy was not an excuse. As I finally was able to order two of the three tables were asking for refunds because the food was cold or of poor quality. I asked for the manager and all he could tell me was sorry they were just behind. I canceled my order and decided to go somewhere else. There is 45 min of my life I won't ever get back."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Answers phone and put me on hold with out asking permission or even telling me they were. After 6min called in from another phone and they answered and took my order. I kept my other line open to see if they'd ever come back on the line. They just kept picking up and putting me back on hold.  Won't be going to this location again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for at least 6 Years, the last 3 times it's been terrible. I'll never return, the service is lousy. And the management is worse. I don't even want to give it 1 star. Today is May 1st, between noon and 1 pm . I've been 1 hour waiting for my lunch . I have watched at least 3 people walk out. The manager Should be out here in the front line , and offering some sort of compensation ."}
{"text":"Come on guys what does it take to have bottled water.  Last 5 times I have come here you were out.  4 out of the last 5 times you were out of chocolate chip cookies.  It's not that hard to store water, it never goes bad.

Food is decent most of the time,  although not always consistent.   The lack of bottle water makes it so I hardly come any more.  We use to come weekly."}
{"text":"This place has cheap, decent Chinese food. It's quick and serves beer, can't really complain too much."}
{"text":"If you are going to eat Chinese this is a good place to attempt to eat healthy. I love the kung pao chicken on lettuce wraps however it still is a lot of calories. You can check out calorie count online which I like, however I wish it would prepopulate nutrition facts as you order online like Panera does. If you want to splurge the crab wontons and chili sauce that comes with it is tasty. If you are part of their rewards program you can get a lot of bogo entrees which is nice for extra leftovers for lunch or dinner during the week they also offer 40-50% orders on certain days so watch email for the promotions."}
{"text":"I tried the Peppered Chicken this time around- not at all like pictured.  Way too much sauce and not enough veggies.  Pretty mediocre for the price, really.  Also, when I made it an issue, the staff weren't very accommodating.  They were too young to care it seems.  I usually have a good experience with this Pei Wei, but lately I haven't been very impressed.

The main redeeming quality of my experience was their Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine.  It is an incredible experience in itself, that is if you enjoy different types of sodas.

I will go back to this location, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Lots of new options available so that you can make it as healthy as you want.  Save time and order via their app and the food is ready when you arrive."}
{"text":"OK...tried it and it was a solid OK.  Walk up to the counter to order, take a seat with a number card for your table and you get served.

Menu is straight forward and simple.  A number of offerings, all with options as to meat (steak or chicken), type of rice (brown or white) and style (the option chosen).  Very simple and there is a large menu board that you can peruse prior to the ordering station, so step aside if you are new to Pei Wei so the experienced hands can stream by you.

You can also order a beverage.  I ordered tea.  Got a hot cup and could only find the two containers of iced tea (sweet and unsweet) and an urn of hot water.  Ummm.  Other that rapidly moving servers there is no help available and being lunch time it was just a couple of chairs short of full.  I opted to put some iced tea into my hot cup and topped it off with hot water.

Portions are of two sizes: small and regular. I had the small and it was.  A measured scoop of rice and my main portion.  Should have ordered the regular which I spied at adjacent tables to be more generous.  If you are on a diet, go small.

This is an in and out place.  Order, sit, eat and go.  There are condiments, which, happily included hot mustard above the drink counter.  

Well run, very clean and tables were bused and reoccupied quickly.

The food was OK...sweet to my taste and lots of soy."}
{"text":"Not authentic in the least, but I should've know that from the moment I walked in. This is pretty much the Chipotle of Asian food, only it doesn't taste like Asian food. My wife and I got the honey seared and Teriyaki bowls with vegetables and tofu. The bowls were identical, except for the sauce slapped on top. Just from the taste alone I can tell you nothing is made in house. The service was great, but the food was just far too bad for me to return."}
{"text":"Been there several times,always for take out.  It's ok, but have had better at other places including other Pei Wei's.  The last straw was when they didn't put lettuce in our take out order for the wraps. Not driving back 4 miles for friggin lettuce. I called and the young lady was very apologetic, and offered to send me a coupon if I would give my address, which I did.  Several weeks later, no coupon. Oh well I'm only one customer they've lost."}
{"text":"For quick fast food.. this is my choice.. I usually call ahead and get take out.. Dont expect super friendly.. but its just take out.. not clear table service.. even if you stay.. I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy.. NOW my friends that usually nosh with me.. hate the foods they get.. they say it every time I suggest this place.. who knows? Since I  havent really tried anything from my norm salad.. I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3.."}
{"text":"Pei Wei, as already mentioned, is PF Chang's Jr.  It's a pretty simple menu.  You basically pick what style of entree you want, then choose your protein (chicken, beef, tofu. shrimp) or extra veggies.  Like Chang's, they incorporate elements of several Asian cultures.  The food is definitely good, and the brown, nutty steamed rice is delicous too.  Though still pretty cheap at about $8 for most entress, you have to pay extra if you want side items and those are expensive.  A spring roll is $2, crab wontons are about $1 each but sold in orders of 2,4, or 6.  If it wasn't for the slightly high price compared to our local Chinese restaurant, I'd give them 4 stars, plus the local place seems to have larger portions.  That being said, however, a bogo free coupon from Pei Wei definitely made me go check it out again and it was a nice change.  If you want some of PF Chang's food served quicker and cheaper, go here."}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei for fast Asian cuisine. I'm glad they stepped up their engagement with rewards although it's a little clunky to sign up and get it going. Nonetheless the food is good and consistent every time I visit this location. It's close to work and the area I am around. 

I do like the crab rangoons as long as they are hot. Sometimes they come out cold but the sweet chili sauce is great. I love Thai Dynamite chicken or steak. It has a strong citrus and nice punch of overall flavor. I usually get the noodles instead of the rice. I know it costs extra (which I don't this it should), but it's business and rice is cheaper. 

This place is always and I mean always packed for lunch. Never been where it isn't. So either come earlier or later if you want to beat the crowd. 

One thing is spiciness level. I always ask for extra extra spicy and it just isn't there. I like spice. And maybe I'm an exception but I haven't had anything here that knocks me off my chair. I'm not sure what they use to make it the spice level they do but I think they could kick it up a notch. 

The service is fine and no one rude which is nice and fairly friendly when they bring you your food. It's cool they clean up after you as well and I don't have to worry about taking everything to a trash bin. It's the little things that make me happy. I know people want 4-5 stars but I don't round up. 3.5 is where I'm at. Again I like Pei Wei and I like the brand and food."}
{"text":"Love coming here the food has been pretty good! 

Allison is really great and welcoming! She has given my friends and I some recommendations on our orders and they have turned out to be pretty good. 

My only complaint is that one time my chicken was so overcooked and very hard to eat and I took it to go.  Hoping this doesn't happen again and will give place another shot."}
{"text":"I always come to this Pei Wei because it's the closest  to my house. I order the same thing every time and it amazes me how much that item varies every time I come in. The good thing is that I like it every time. The only complaint I would have is that under the tables are so sticky every time. I wonder how much they get cleaned if at all. But the staff is always so friendly."}
{"text":"Ugh!  This W Sunset Rd. location was nothing like the Eastern location!  We ordered spicey tuna rolls & wasabi tuna rolls & egg rolls.  There was nothing good about any of them!  They don't even know how to roll the damn rolls!!!!!  The sushi rolls fell apart...there was very little tuna and just thick rice!  The absolute worst tuna rolls I've ever had anywhere!  I asked the manager if this is really how they serve them....he said \"Well....they're learning how to roll them\".  Instead of saying...well no...that isn't correct...let me have some new ones made for you!  I said it's ALL RICE AND HARDLY ANY TUNA AT ALL!  He said...well...I guess thats how they make them.  I was stunned at his stupid response!  So....$30 later....we left and got a pizza to take home!  Place was pathetic!  Save your money...and drive to the Eastern location.  There's no comparison to this location.  Management is a joke at Sunset location!"}
{"text":"the location is convenient being it is literally across the street! i've gone a couple times for lunch and dinner in the past couple weeks. i like their speedy service and self serve takeout boxes and fortune cookies. the dining area looks like it seats about 40 or less, it's a good thing i've never experienced a busy, busy pei wei. i love the fried rice. also had spicy korean beef and pei wei spicy. i would recommend having chicken pei wei spicy and ask for the chicken not to be battered = deeeelishhh! :)"}
{"text":"I really don't understand how anyone can eat the food from here.  Granted, I am Chinese and enjoy authentic food, however I like good Chinese American food.  For someone who usually doesn't leave food on her plate unless it is really bad, I could not finish my meal because it was tasteless and below average."}
{"text":"We were last at this location on 12/4/14. My daughter had a side of fried rice with her entree. After beginning to eat it, she found worms in the rice! Management was notified and they made her a new order and comped the meal. Needless to say, we didn't want to finish eating. I wrote to their corporate customer service to let them know what happened & NO RESPONSE. This used to be one of our weekly restaurants, but we've been unable to go back since. The lack of interest by the company is not adding confidence that the food is safe and not infested. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience last night.
They brought out my boyfriends food and said mine would be right out...we waiting 15 mins and I told him to eat his now COLD FOOD!  After 30 mins, I asked about mine...the young said she would check and never did...I asked again a a nice man went back and the kitchen looked dumb founded...he never came back...about 10 minutes llater, another guy came to the table and said they would remake it and I would have it soon.  I asked for it to go since my boyfriend had finished long ago...20 minutes later they brought a bag to me.  We left....When I got home...I had someone else's order... PF Changs would be appalled...."}
{"text":"Wasabi crunch sushi roll was very good. Lots of tuna and yummy sauce.  Was not very busy but had good service"}
{"text":"Pei Wei, why oh why did you think it would be smart of change your menu and the look of your original concept?  I personally think it was a bad move!  I hate that there are not many of the original items on the menu at this new, remodel.  

I had the BBQ Korean dish which didnt really have much flavor and was kind of bland!  I also miss the separate line there use to be for people who called in or ordered online.  I probably won't be coming back to this location.  If I need to I will find another location that has the old items because those items are what made Pei Wei one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I like it, sometimes place doesn't look so clean, but when your craving oriental food, that's reasonable, I guess I can overlook some things."}
{"text":"The food is never disappointing but I ordered four wontons & received two. Decided to have a bud light which has been years, not cold enough especially there in an ice chest by register. It's not because it's room temperature I just can't even finish it and then went to the beer, lol! It just sounded so refreshing but the water nice was a lot better :-)"}
{"text":"We ordered online, but our food was ready about 20 minutes after the 'pickup time'. Does anyone remember when you'd be offered a complimentary drink when they got so far behind on their pickup orders? I guess that's a thing in the past.

After handing us our order, we asked about fortune cookies. The employee behind the counter indicated they were near the utensils. There weren't any cookies in the bin - so we waited a minute till someone came back to us so we could ask them for the cookies that were in the bin back in their area.

4 of our orders specified extra sauce on the side, but when we got home there were only two unmarked sauce containers.

My General Tso's Chicken, while being a 'regular size' entree had very little sauce and what seemed like 4 or 5 small pieces of chicken (probably 8 of the inedible peppers that I needed to fish out).

Our experience at this Pei Wei has been a lot better in the past, so I can only assume these problems are due to policy changes or employee leadership problems. I love Pei Wei, but I'm going to think twice before returning to this location."}
{"text":"If you sign up for the Pei Wei newsletter you get 2 to 3 coupons a week. Because of this the lines for dine in can be very long at times. I will call in my order and use the pick up window. My order is ready quickly and always on time. Food quality is great and when using a coupon is a great deal."}
{"text":"Been many times but it's been several years. Needed a quick healthy lunch. I was pleased to see they have a new poke type bowl promotion called the Spicy Polynesian Poke bowl. It's reasonably priced, healthy and very flavorful and filling. That plus a tasty iced green tea makes for a solid quick service lunch option."}
{"text":"Normally would give 5 stars but my experience today sucked. They were out of a ton of flavors on both coke machines, and food was mediocre.  Dont get the classic lettuce wraps. Get them from cheesecake factory or pf changs. The diced chicken ruined it. Too salty, wouldve been better with with a sweet chili dipping sauce. There were no water chestnuts as advertised.  My boyfriends teriyaki chicken also came out with the wrong vegatables. These cooks seem to put on their own style (aka whatever they feel like putting on it). Strange. I will stick to what I know is good next time. Unusual experience, pei wei is usually on point and extremely tasty and fresh, especially for the price."}
{"text":"manager Veronica delivers the best service. I ordered a dish that was too salty and she was courteous all the way and made sure I got a different dish. Thank you for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei but I had a miserable experience here at lunch time. I wanted to sit outside but when I entered the patio it was so disgusting I immediately returned inside. All the tables were dirty and one had not been bussed so it was proving a very nice meal for at least 4 pigeons. Also it's very unpleasant because there are 2 different musics blaring right next to each other 1 from Starbucks 1 from Pei Wei and that should be addressed. When I got my food I was also extremely disappointed as my lettuce wraps were so oily I couldn't eat them so I just left. The staff here needs to get it together. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I get take out from here 2-3 times a month and it's always right. I've never had a problem. 

Today was the first time I placed the order in store, usually it's done online. I expected a horrible wait but I was in and out in 10 min with my lunch. 


Awesome food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Not busy. We sat outside, lovely patio. Ordered sweet and sour chicken and Mongolian beef. The chicken was great but the beef was horrible. It was sooooooo salty. The manager was great, he got us another dish, but it was not good either. I would recommend going but do not recommend the Mongolian beef again want to thank the manager for great customer service... forgot his name but I added his photo with his permission"}
{"text":"Time to Yelp a great meal at a national chain. Orange Peel beef came out perfect and staff was friendly and helpful. Manager was a young guy with dark hair and had the staff hopping. Good quick meal."}
{"text":"Update:  Pei Wei has done a significant re-vamp to their menu and unfortunately I have to say I am not inpressed.

We ordered the Kung-Pao, Pei Wei Spicy, Thai Dynamite, and one other (that I can't recall).  So one huge downer is that there is no longer ANY curry dish on the menu.  They have all been removed.  If you're going to do Asian Fusion and represent several Asian cultures, you simply can not do that much justice without at least one or two curry dishes on the menu.  

What just completely floored me was when we got them home and opened them up (side by side), was that they have become just the same dish with very minor differences (peanuts in the kung pao) and different sauce.  

So it would appear that the menu re-vamp has been made so they can use the same base ingredients for each dish and modify slightly for each order.  This doesn't really come through unless you take the buffet approach to your order like we did when we got it home.  But if you do that, it will become pretty clear that you just ordered the same dish 4x with slightly different sauce.

Wow, big dissapointment in my book, and drops Pei Wei below my line for what I'm willing to accept for Asian food.. just too fast and similar to Applebee's for me."}
{"text":"Big Fan of Pei Wie... but certainly not this location. Tried 3 times to eat here and each time the service is painfully slow, food is undercooked, the place is incredibly dirty and the fountain drinks are always out. 

Based on how consistently bad this location is from our experiences and other reviews, it's obvious management doesn't give a crap. Such a bummer. 

Avoid at all cost. Drive 20 minutes to go to a different location."}
{"text":"Tonight's experience at Pei Wei was poor. The boy who took our order was dismissive a rude. I say boy because he had no edict of a young man. I asked about gluten free options and my needs and questions were abruptly answered. 
Our edamame arrived cold and soggy.  My meal was incorrect and when the correct steamed chicken and broccoli was delivered it was very overlooked. Soggy broccoli and rubbery chicken. 
The only shining star in this restaurant is Hector. He is an ace and should work in a much better restaurant. Hector replaced our edamame. It  was still soggy, but steaming hot and Hector was happy to do it. Hector also replaced my incorrect meal with what I actually ordered. Hector is always so nice to everyone. He goes out of his way to make people feel special and take care of their needs. Now you just need to replace the boy at the counter and your cook. Poor job Pei Wei."}
{"text":"This place is either hit or miss. The first time I was here my soba was soo salty that I couldn't finish my noodles, and I'm a girl that loves her noddles. I came back again, and got the curry and it was really pretty decent. I friend ordered the pad thai, and I know its not authentic, but there was something in the sauce that made me think, wow, maybe this place isn't as bad as I thought. 

I went back earlier this week to get my own pad thai and was disappointed once again. I don't know if its the change in the moon cycle, the way the wind blows, or which chef is making the food, but it totally stumps me how this place can be so on and off. Overall, more off times than on, so I'm going with 2 stars."}
{"text":"We come here a lot, but the last couple of times the service hasn't been the same. We order our dishes and the server tried to tell us, that's what you order. Both dishes were wrong, I believe the cashier put the order in wrong. Tried to explain this to the manager (Mark) and all he had was  attitude. He never apologize and all he said was if you wanted more pineapple you should have order the large. It wasn't the size, but the wrong dish. They prepare new dishes for us, but let it just sit on the counter until I got upset and walk up and said, is this our order. We won't be back and that's because of the Manager (Mark) It's sad because we have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch it was very good and fast. The lettuce wraps were excellent and very filling. I would definitely recommend this place if you want fast food at a good price."}
{"text":"Nasty. If I had walked by the kitchen and seen the bathroom before I ordered, I would have walked out. FILTHY. Roaches in the bathroom-yuck. Pooling drain backup in the back kitchen. Old food pieces on the floor in the kitchen. For curiosity I looked up the Health Dept. inspection. Not surprising but it's not good. Multiple violations and they don't even have an inspection grade. Says Not Participating. https://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/Mobile

My food was bad. Way overseasoned with chili. Way too much noodles with just a hint of protein. After reading the inspection and seeing the roaches, I felt a little queasy...

Won't go back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so my review is probably not worth much but I thought the food was really salty. That's probably why I haven't been back since. 

The restaurant is nice though, service is good, and easy to find."}
{"text":"Close at 9:30 but hang up on you if you call after 8:30, if that's your hours then mark it as such on yelp don't leave people on hold for ten mins then hang up then send them to the line that keeps saying you're on hold but nobody picks up. BS!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Pei Wei, but this particular location, not so much. My friend and I ordered the chicken pad Thai, and chicken lettuce wraps. The chicken lettuce wraps were good, but the pad Thai was way too spicy for my liking. I've had the chicken pad Thai dozens of time from Pei Wei, and it has never been that spicy. When I told the ladies up front about it, they looked so annoyed and acted like I was wrong and dumb for even saying that. They came over and told us that the sauce is pre-made and always tastes that way so there was nothing they could do about it, when I know for a fact it doesn't ever taste like that. They offered to get us a side of rice or something but it didn't seem like they really meant it so we declined. If I go to Pei Wei again, I'll definitely go to a different one. Also, the soda machines were out of every flavor I wanted, they should work on changing things when they run out."}
{"text":"I've never seen it as busy as it was last night. 7:00 on a Sunday and it was packed, 30 min wait just for some lettuce wraps to-go. 

We dine here about 3 times a month and *knock on wood* it's always been great. I've never had a bad meal, my order is always correct. I never get home and realize they forgot a sauce or gave me the wrong food. I'm impressed."}
{"text":"Yes this is a chain created by Paul Flemming, however the food is decent, there are many vegetarian choices and this location adds a bit of local flavor to the chain's formula.

On my last visit I opted the the yellow curry Thai noodles with tofu. First i would like to say is that the Tofu at Pei Wei is some of the best, it is firm and has a skin with a different texture than the bulk of it. The noodles were standard floppy wide  rice noodles with with some veggies. the sauce did lack the punch you would get from a genuine Thai place however.

Some other nice things about this chain include:
*Order at the counter format: save on the tip
*Self serve fountain drinks: Faster refills impress the date by getting them for her
* Many condiments: Spice the meal to taste.
*All you can eat fortune cookies: Don like your fortune? Try another!

Parking here can be a bit of a challenge, but you can park on the next residential block south of here.

There also is only one menu, so lunch prices can be a bit steep, crossing the $10 line."}
{"text":"Over two years later and we've limited our visits to once every couple months. Just tonight we picked it up to go, only to have my husband drive all the way back because we were missing an entire entree. This location is still the worst."}
{"text":"First, a comment to the other reviews on here.  Duh, it's not authentic.  Everyone knows that, and you don't go here for \"authentic\" Chinese cuisine.  That's what dim sum is for.  Also, if you were so disgusted about people making out in the corner, why didn't YOU say anything?  I bet the employees were equally shocked, and uncertain of how to handle the issue.

That being put aside, I really do enjoy Pei Wei.  They have good food for a really good price, and it's usually in and out real quick, except friday and saturday nights.

Not quite a five star rating, since there's not a ton of seating space at this location and it seems like the people bringing your food usually get the tables wrong, but those are minor complaints."}
{"text":"It's kind of hard to rate food when you waited in line your entire lunch hour for an online order that you put in before they even opened!  I had to leave without my food because my lunchtime was over.  The line for pick-ups twisted all the way through the entire restaurant!  What a joke.  Don't bother on a work day at lunchtime.  Oh, also don't bother signing up for their \"birthday\" emails.  They give you a free drink or a starter (small edamame, 1 spring roll or 2 wontons), so you save a whole whopping $2.19.  Wow."}
{"text":"Food was great.. But it took 35 minutes to get it, after a few complaints
We ordered the chow mein chicken, lettuce wraps and mongollion beef"}
{"text":"Never been a fan of PF Changes, what I always thought was the equivalent of over priced Chinese microwave dinners. Well they did it right with Pei Wei. Lots of fresh food for great prices. And we had excellent fast service when we went. I recommend the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei, I can't put my finger on why. The Kung Pao Chicken Extra spicy is great. I like sitting at the bar to watch all the cooks. Those guys are in the zone when they are back there cooking and its busy. It's a nice medium for me and my daughter, she likes the restaurant next door, I go to Pei Wei and we meet on the patio."}
{"text":"Quick, Fast, Easy, and I love their pad thai"}
{"text":"Terrible. Two pounds of rice, deep fried breaded chicken. All bread. Salty af, had to drink 6 cups of water during meal"}
{"text":"Sesame Chicken very tasty, brown rice nicely compliments. Friendly service, clean tables. Healthy choices, reasonable prices. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went to Pei Wei so many times and today is a disaster. Ordered Spicy Tuna Roll and the thing came out ice cold. Sushi is supposed to be served at room temperature, not cold. It tastes like it's pre-made in the morning or the night before. the rice was cold and dry. I told the server, she looked at me like I was out of my mind and said \"sushi is supposed to be cold\". No no no. It is not. I have gone to many sushi places in my life (including in Japan), I know what sushi is supposed to be like. 
I guess the sushi at Pei Wei is pretty cheap, I shouldn't have expected \"restaurant quality\" stuff."}
{"text":"We went as a family of 6 and was treated very poorly by the manager at the  place. The food was greasy (I guess most Americans would love it since they don't see the difference) The manager had the audacity to compare this restaurant with PF Chang which is equally greasy and bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to any health conscious people. To top it all its expensive. Go to taco bell or China Panda and save your frustration and your appetite. Just being fancy is not the attraction motto for me. Maybe they will train their managers to change the attire of the restaurant. I wont waste my time here."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.
My friend and I ordered take out (sushi and rice with chicken)
As soon as I walked in the crew members there did not show good customer service and they were in their own world as I stood there confused.
Another thing is when we got our food and left we didn't realize till we got home how bad the food was, I ended up not finishing the sushi because it was not put together correctly and tasted old and made me sick after eating what I could before I threw it out. 
My friends food was not warm (rice and chicken) and she couldn't bring herself to eat it.
I  normally eat at the one in scottsdale and I am a big fan of pei wei but this location was not good."}
{"text":"So, I used to LOVE Pei Wei. Like I've been a die-hard Pei Wei eater at this location for more than 10 years. And guess what, it's gone down hill so much. I went for lunch today and tried their new ancho chilli lime chicken salad and it was the grossest salad I've ever choked down. I am a fat kid for life and usually eat anything you out in front of me, but I just couldn't get it down. It had breaded chicken nuggets on it for one. Ewwwwwe. I thought it would be grilled or pulled chicken like their other salads. The greens and veggie were half rotten. I asked for dressing on the side and it came swimming in it with an extra cup of it on the side. Super disappointing. I totally won't ever order this salad again. I'll probably eat at Pei Wei again because I am a hopeful person. P.S. I did some research, Pei Wei broke away from P.F. Chang's around the beginning of the year, that's why they are changing so much."}
{"text":"Best Pei Wei I go to. I order a weird meal, and they always get everything right. My fried rice has chicken, beef, and shrimp. Most other Pei Wei's charge extra for \"extra protein\" and there is far too much in the bowl. This one rings it up at the same price and splits the meat into thirds so you are not getting a bowl of meat. Service is always great, lines are long (because its good), we will keep on coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of our favorite fast service chains. This meal was definitely missing something. Mine was Coconut Curry Chicken, husbands was Chicken Pad Thai. We both agreed it was missing some zing and depth to the flavor. This is not a Pei Wei issue, this is a local issue because we have had these dishes elsewhere and been satisfied."}
{"text":"Great service, fast and healthy options. I thought the menu was difficult to figure out and there was a group ahead of us that let us go ahead because they couldn't figure it out. Or food was all extremely hot, I'm happy it was fresh, but we had to wait a good 10 minutes before we could enjoy. Staff was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Busy or not, this place will serve your food pretty quick so it's a great spot for lunch especially if you work nearby. This covers the aspect of time. 

This said however, even though my colleagues and I finished our dishes. we weren't blown away by the food. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and one of my colleagues ordered the Kung Pao chicken with fried rice and my 2nd colleague ordered the spicy chicken. All were considered just good, nothing special. 

I cannot begin to count how many times I've had Pad Thai in all the previous years. So far, there are only very few places that have impressed me and I kept going back to have their Pad Thai over and over again. This Pad Thai however even though it was fresh and hot, did not hit the mark.

They have a lot of other dishes on the menu so before I decide whether or not I would be returning here in the future, I would like to give other dishes a try. I will be happy with one dish being superb and I'm willing to return just for it, but this is what will bring me back always, a GREAT dish!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I eat at Pei Wei and really enjoy my food. I was in the area so I decided to give this branch I try. I was hesitant because of my experience with the Scottsdale branch but I am glad I still decided to give them a try. 

I got there a little after three. A few tables only were occupied. I ordered the Mongolian beef. Normally it is served with rice however, I decided to replace the rice with noodles. This had an extra charge of c.99. 

When the food came out about 7-10 min after I ordered, it was piping hot. I got the regular portion size rather than the small; I was so hungry! The portion size was perfect, the food was fresh and delicious! It had the right amount of spices, sauce and flavor!! 

So glad I decided to give this branch a try. I will be going there again in the future to try other dishes as well. 

Well done Pei Wei Dana Park branch. You made me very happy today!"}
{"text":"Appreciate the response from Pei Wei and went to take their survey but they want a bunch of info that I don't want to give. 

Frankly this is very typical service for the last 2-3 months - We eat out too much! I guess I should thank Pei Wei for the self awareness. 

Eat at home kids!

Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a work day. The food is good. Not fantastic just good. It's usually always busy at lunch time, so make sure to plan accordingly. 

In my opinion, the staff at this location were a little on the lackluster (borderline rude) side, but honestly, what can you expect from a \"fast food\" Asian diner. 

I ordered the crab wontons and the Thai-style lettuce wraps. The crab wontons were pretty good, but came on a plate that was drenched in sweet and sour sauce. They didn't have much crab taste to them (or much flavor at all), and were primarily cream cheese. The Thai lettuce wraps, in my opinion, are pretty sub-par to the original style, but they were still pretty decent. 

When I was there, there were two employees walking around clearing dishes and bussing tables who managed to get in a little bit of a heated argument while walking around, which wasn't the greatest show to eat to. But all in all, wasn't a deal breaker. 

I have more free lettuce wrap coupons, so of course I'll be back. It's a quick bite for Asian food. But if you're looking for a super quality Chinese/Asian place at really good prices, I would recommend Joyful Chinese (Mtn. View and Hayden) or Da Vang Vietnamese (19th Ave and Central)"}
{"text":"First time here and very disappointed! Food too salty. Rice not fully cooked. Got their Mango sushi roll and it tasted like it was prepared yesterday. Taste stale and rice again not cooked. Their slogan is 'Hand crafted fresh' but that is not the case for us.  This not real Asian food."}
{"text":"It's PF Changs cheaper cousin and I actually like it much better.

I've never been a fan of Changs.  Even after running the R&R marathon and getting various coupons and deals, which had us eating there several times, I never bonded at all.

Not so at Pei Wei.  

I like their food, it's hot and fresh, there is a nice selection to choose from, and the value is there."}
{"text":"I admit I'm not a huge fan. But my family likes it so I go. I just had some really bad take out service one time. So I'd you go order in and you'll get your food faster."}
{"text":"Typical Pei Wei. Kick ass food, hostess gives me a funny look when I order (in all fairness my order is quite odd), and a killer Coke machine. Keeps us coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Great food for a great value. We come here often and the key is consistency, the employees here have it."}
{"text":"Came to have dinner after checking hours of operation and they were closed 30 min earlier than posted. Now have to find another place to eat."}
{"text":"Coconut curry dish was tasty. Could've used more chicken and a little less rice, but it filled 2 of us up."}
{"text":"Love this location! We came in here around 9:15 right before closing time, they treated us like it was any other part of the day (unlike most places when you come in right before closing). When we were sitting around eating they came to our table to make sure we weren't drinking iced tea before they took apart the machine. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp lo mean to go...got all the way home, opened it up, stirred it in alittle....and THERE WAS A LIVE SPIDER IN IT. I took it all the way back, got a refund and a new dish, and they didn't even make it right the second time. I got plain noodles with a few pieces of shrimp in it. Needless to say, this regular customer WILL NOT be back... EVER. I am thoroughly disgusted and mad."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this location a star! This location has to be by far the worst location ever. I placed a order over the phone Saturday evening. I came home to find out they messed up my order. So I called back to let them know, the manager Betty answered. First off, she was SO rude. She was basically trying to tell me that my order wasn't wrong. I explained exactly what I wanted on my order, so I proceed to go back to pick up food and she told me it was going to be another 30 minutes before my order would be ready. The fact that I had to drive back to get my order right was frustrating and her attitude was so horrible. I asked to speak to a manager and she was like \"I am the manager on duty\" I'm so shocked and appalled by how she even became a manager. I got to the restaurant and I told her exactly what I wanted, the fact that she wasn't trying to write it down or enter it into the computer was annoying cause I knew they would mess up again. So she comes out with my food and yet again they messed up. Not once did she apologize for the inconvenience they caused, the other girls were nice, but as a manager she was so rude and inconsiderate. Even if this was the last pei wei in the states, I will NEVER step foot into this location again."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, great variety, decent service and festive atmosphere. Somewhat hidden and a little tricky to get to; however, visible from two main roads. Not our go-to location for Asian Cuisine, but we've never been disappointed the half dozen or so times we've eating here. It's pretty average price wise for the area."}
{"text":"I believe pei wei is owned by pf changs. I prefer pei wei over pf changs. Same good quality Chinese food at a better price."}
{"text":"While I like the food here, it seems like the service is just really hit and miss.  Just went a few nights ago, and after waiting 20 minutes for my food, I was informed they were out of what I ordered.  Then, they were out of forks and fortune cookies.  

That being said, when they do have my order, the food is always fresh and flavorful.  The management seems to realize when there are issues, as they have provided free appetizers and such when we were unhappy.  

Overall, a decent place, but might have to start trying other locations."}
{"text":"The  first  two  times  I  went  there  it  was  ok  but  yesterday  I  decided  not  to  come  back:  I  ordered  the  \"Cashew nut  chicken\"   and  what  I  got  where  chunks  of  deep  fried  chicken  fat  (the  stuff  that  i  usually  cut  off  and  give  to my  dogs),  no  white  meat,  just  disgusting  chicken  garbage.   Altogether  there  were  7  cashew nuts  on  my  plate  (yes,  I  counted  them).   When  i  received  my  dish  my  wife  had  already  finished  her  dish  because  they  did  not serve  our  dishes  at  the  same  time.  

 Nobody  came  to  ask  if  we  liked  the  food,  what  I  was  hoping  for,  instead  someone  threw  a  comments  card  onto  our  table."}
{"text":"Ok this Pei Wei is the best one I've ever been in. OUTSTANDING!!!

Is this owned by a private owner? This place is AWESOME.
Super clean, great staff (except the black guy that walks around looking to stab someone with a broom handle) What's with that guy?

The food was above and beyond what I've had at any other PW.

Kudos to this place, I'll eat here once a week."}
{"text":"Last night, my daughter and I ate at this location. Or, should I say \"my daughter ate.\"

I ordered our food at 6:54. They brought out the edamame in like 10 minutes. Then, my daughter's food about 7:15.  I patiently waited for mine. When nothing came, I got up and asked the girl who was taking food to tables where my food was. She told me she'd check and bring it right over. I watched and waited. Meanwhile, my daughter was finished eating. Finally, at 7:35 I went up to the counter and said I never got my food. I'd like a refund because I can't wait any longer. The cashier called over the manager and said, \"She needs a refund. Sushi.\" He casually says \"sorry, we ran out of sushi.\" Really? So, you knew you had no sushi, took my order, took my money and just let me sit there for over 40 minutes waiting? Nobody was going to tell me? Offer me something else? Wow. 

He refunded my meal and my daughter's meal. As if that made things ok. No, not really. I left the restaurant after being there 40 minutes and didn't eat. That's not exactly ok. 

As convenient as this place is, I won't be going back. And, I'm pretty sure they don't really care."}
{"text":"I've become quite the fan of Pei Wei, I love the kung pao chicken entree with the fried rice. I am also a big fan of the Mongolian Beef as well and ask that they cook it so that it is crispy. Tried the Sushi on a few occasions and think that they make it the day before and refrigerate it so I am no longer interested in that anymore. I only wish that they had a larger dining room as it seems to always be full and hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"This rating is for online ordering pick up. I have ordered online a few times. We love Pei Wei but this location is awful. I ordered Friday, was given a 12:30 pick up time. I arrived and it was very busy, to be expected, I paid for my meals at 12:24. The guy who took my payment turned around and went to answer phones immediately. I noticed a few bags sitting on the counter ready for pick up, assumed mine was not ready since he didn't turn around, pick up a bag and give it to me. So I sat down next to the lady that was in front of me, she too was given a 12:30 pick up time. As we sat there watching tons of people walk in pay for their pick up and leave. The guy who took our payments was still on the phones, another guy from the front cash register had slid over to help the numerous people in line to pay and pick up. After chit chatting with the other lady I decided I was done waiting, it was now 12:43pm. After flagging down the guy who originally took my payment I asked him if they were far behind on orders as mine was to be ready at 12:30. He said, oh let me check on it. He turned around to the bags that have been sitting there since I had walked in at 12:24 and said here you go. I asked him why our bags have been sitting there since we walked in and why I had to wait 25 minutes for my food that was sitting on the counter since I walked in. He said, sorry I was busy on the phones. REALLY... UNBELIEVABLE! I told him it was ridiculous and the manager needs to fix this. He shook his head, smiled and walked away. WOW! I looked on the receipt stapled to my bag, the receipt that tells you when the food was bagged and ready for pick up, 12:18! Horrible service. I think I will continue to use another location for my husband's Pei Wei cravings. Too bad, this location is so convenient but so not worth it!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get fresh Asian food and great service. We mostly come here (Sunset Rd.) because of Allison! She is the most amazing person. We keep coming back because of her kindness and great service."}
{"text":"Food is usually okay... tonight fried rice was way overdone & mushy, I asked for spicy teriyaki & got regular on the bowl itself as well as on the side. Disappointed about it."}
{"text":"I like their Caramel Chicken. I think its the slivers of cucumber that make me enjoy this dish. It's a little freshness and crunch that adds nice contrast to the sweet fried chicken. Mongolian Beef is pretty tasty also but can be a bit heavy. I've tried a few of their lettuce wraps also which were just okay."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei!!! The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that I think I love China Way (see my other review) more and its more authentic I believe. Everytime I have been to Pei wei though, I have not be disapointed. I have several favs. The honey seared chicken is amazing, as are the Pei Wei spicy beef, lettuce wraps, and Dan Dan noodles. The orange beef , pad thai, and chicken lo mein are pretty good as well but I rarely order them because I love the other dishes more. I love that you can order noodles with your entrees in place of the rice but having the option of brown rice is nice as well when I am trying to watch what I eat. Another tip if you are watching calories: you can get any main dish with the chicken steamed instead of battered and fried. Pei Wei also makes the most amazing crab wontons with the best sauce evar!!! One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to crab wontons is when there is no crab. Hello, crab is in the name so it should be present in the dish! At Pei Wei, you can actually taste and see the crab in their wontons. Mix that with the sweet chili sauce they serve the wontons on and these are great! Don't get me wrong though, I've tried some of their other dishes that I was not a big fan of. Their thai coconut chicken was a little bland, the sweet and sour chicken is not what I look for in sweet and sour chicken (the sauce wasnt very strong), and the mongollian chicken had a strange flavor that I didnt care for. But to each his own, people have different taste. Anyways, Pei Wei is one of my favorite places to go and the prices are relatively cheap. I agree with one reviewer in why would you go to PF Changs when Pei Wei has the same food pretty much at a fraction of the price not to mention the portions are bigger."}
{"text":"Most things are good in the menu.....the fried rice is the worst ever.....made by total amateurs......"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this pei Wei again.

Every time I go I'm disappointed my noodles are sticky and soggy etc"}
{"text":"They're trying.. I think? I saw Pei Wei advertised as 'for health conscious eaters' on google's recommendations for quick eats. I did not notice what may be so healthy about it. Is it non-gmo? Organic? If so, what is? I didn't get a lot of time to concentrate on the menu on my first time in. I felt a bit rushed as it's set up kind of like a chipotle. I'm rating it 3 stars for good service, but only okay tasting food."}
{"text":"Good and consistent for a chain. Never can go wrong with the food."}
{"text":"Cleary I am stuffed and can't get enough. Portion control is not easy for me here because the food is so good. I could honestly eat here every day. My neighborhood Pei Wei is a regular dining spot of mine. 

The setup for this location is different then other location because this is Pei Wei Asian Market. They have a concept similar to a to go Asian restaurant however it is the same great Pei Wei entree's and taste. My favorite is the Dan Dan Noodle Bowl or making my entrees into salads to substitute for rice. Got a gluten allergy no problem they have a gluten free menu. Kid friendly menu offered. 

Everyone at this location is super friendly. You can tell they enjoy their jobs and the atmosphere. This location is always clean I have never seen a dirty table nor have I ever had to wait for one. The only suggestion I have for this location is for to go. Every time i order a to go it is like they wait for me to get there to cook my order instead of having it ready by the promise time. Other then that every is perfect. 

Unlimited refills at the drink station and help yourself to fortune cookies. Gets no better then this."}
{"text":"I am VERY PICKY and hate to try new things.. Well I have to Thank my GF Ashley for taking me into trying Pie Wei because they are amazing.  The servings are big and the flavor is right on.  The staff are all friendly and take there time to explain what's in the different dishes. You order at the counter and they give you a # sign to place on your table. When your order is ready they bring it to you.  They have a big selection of self serve soda with free refills."}
{"text":"Thought I would give the sushi a try (I know, I know) . . . Good thing I got the 4-piece. Spicy tuna and the mango California rolls had too much rice and the filing was bland.  

And I got a surprise in my szechuan green beans, something that was like a string of plastic.  (Photo posted)

I got my order to go, so I didn't find that out until I got home. The service was ok."}
{"text":"Is this food even edible? I wouldn't even feed my dog this food. Very low quality! So disgusting! We will never eat at a Pei Wei again. Hopefully we don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"This is a quick and easy version of their sister restaurant; PF Changs. Place your order. Dishes are broken down with your choice of meats or tofu, take your number, sit down, and in a few minutes they bring you your perfectly stir fried fresh and yummy meal. It's also cheaper and it has a theater style kitchen so you can sit and watch the chefs make your meal if you like. Cheap, yummy, easy, fresh, and vegetarian if you so choose."}
{"text":"LEMON PEPPER IS BACK! I don't know when it got re-introduced on the menu, but this seriously made my day.

Just for that, I am bumping this Pei Wei up to 4 stars. Quick service even when the line is out the door; friendly service; and delicious lemon pepper chicken. Pei Wei can now officially be added back to our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Sun food six service sux everything sux and no more lo mein! Zero stars should be possible"}
{"text":"this place is good for family,  The price is right and they serve good beer.  The food is pretty good four stars are for the service.  I don't like looking over at the kitchen and seeing the cooks eat food while they are cooking so that is why they get one star deduction"}
{"text":"Super, super disappointed.
Small portion, very greasy, and no flavor.
When I asked the employee about the serving size and the meal, she was no where near cooperative or helpful.
Pei Wei used to be so good.
I could not get over how awful it was.
Never going back."}
{"text":"Well, this will teach me to check here first - 3 stars? I probably would have chosen a different place to have lunch. This is my first Pei Wei experience, and even before the food gets here, I know I won't be back, at least, not to this location. The man taking my order at the counter was just downright rude when I asked about the spiciness of the pad thai. I thought it was a reasonable question, one I've asked a gazillion times in a bazillon restaurants. He launched into a tirade about not knowing other people's taste buds, the spiciness not being adjustable, etc. and I finally had to cut him off with \"I gotcha\" just to shut him up. Rude, rude, rude. Not acceptable to me. I'm really hoping the food is good. At least, there's that. And yes, I ordered the pad thai. For now, they get 2 stars because it smells good in here. I'll update the review after I've eaten.

Updated review of food: fairly tasty, ingredients fresh, slices of tofu kind of weird (I eat a lot of tofu but have never had this kind with with dark edges), sauce much oilier than other pad thais I've had, and my taste buds would call it medium spicy. Would I order it again? Probably not - too much oil for my liking. I might try something else on the menu but as I already mentioned, not at this location.

Keeping the 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place wasn't busy at 2pm in the afternoon.  Was trying to call in an order for the past 30 mins.  Drove in and ordered in person and they were obviously not busy, there were 4 girls NOT busy st all.  I stated I tried calling and NO APOLOGIES!  I asked if they just no longer take phone calls, got no reply.  She ignored my questions and just took my order.  Lazy and unprofessional!  This place used to have great customer service as I used to comer here a lot on my lunch breaks.  Pretty disappointing!  Could've saved time as I was on my lunch break to just pickup my order!!!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei.  If you have been, you know it is 5 stars. It is always consistent, the Pei Wei Spicy is always good, and I have never heard a complaint. Love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good, service was wonderful. My only complaint was.....it's cold in here!!! So I Google why is Pei Wei so cold. Seems Iike they keep all the Pei Wei that way.  Now the only thing I can figure is they get people in and out quick and serve as many people as they can. Because I sure don't want to sit in here too long. I look around 2 women are looking for a place that's warm to sit... good luck. They just want that mighty dollar. So hurry and eat and get out."}
{"text":"Seem to go to Pei Wei about every 3 or 4 weeks with very very inconsistent results. They change their menu more often than most restaurants and I do not think that is good thing. They should try and perfect a few dishes. My last visit was a 1 star event with the order first being screwed up and then each dish having to so much sauce on it, was almost not edible.  But they continue to be busy  so probably don't care too much about quality.  Will try again in 3 or 4 weeks and see if might be 2 or 3 stars.  Lets hope so."}
{"text":"I have never had problems with any other location except this one. Not only was our food cold but completely gross. We ordered it extra spicy and extra sauce. Both our meals were dry. I'm a vegetarian so I ordered mine with tofu. There were about 5 peices in there. And they put broccoli in which I asked them not to. We ordered a large side of edamame and it wasn't even half full and most of the pods were empty!! This is not a cheap place to eat at and I expected so much better. I did not take it back because my bf is sweet and didn't want to complain. Needless to say I am very disappointed and will not return to this location ever as this is the second time it has happened."}
{"text":"So we placed this order online and the girl at the register says \"we don't have enough to make the mango California and the teriyaki crunch roll\" even though they're the same roll with extra ingredients. So that was the first thing we hear, THEN we get home and notice they didn't include the cookies which I paid for. On top of that they put the cold sushi in the same bag as our hot food, right under it, so our sushi was nice and warm when we got home, less then 10 minutes later. This was our first AND last time here. Forget this place, don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Pei Weis orange chicken does not, and I mean does not taste orangy and the white chicken was dry.  I hate the commercial cause its not the truth.  Getting tired of commercial."}
{"text":"Chicken Pud Thai today, but it was nothing special. I thought i remembered it being better here."}
{"text":"Hooray! A new place to eat great food!  How can you not want that?  I had the god fortune to get t watch this diner built from the get go.  I have gotten to know the managers and the staff, all of which rock.  These guys are doing an amazing job.  I had never eaten at a Pei Wei prior to this one opening and have to say I'm now hooked!!  I have tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something that I didn[t like.  The food is always hot and fresh and ready when they tell me it will be.  Parking is a bit of a problem, but with Starbucks Coffee literally right next door, it's worth the trouble.  This place definately puts yummy in your tummy!!"}
{"text":"We ordered lettuce wraps and it literally looked like two scoops of chicken. We feel cheated and contacted the manager who barely spoke English. We will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"We have lived by this place for a few years and haven't tried it until now. My fiancé always hears it talked about on sports radio Burns & Gambo.

So we were unsure about the ordering process and the cashier I guess helped us out. I got my usual go-to sweet n sour chicken and my fiancé got the Mongolian beef. Both were excellent and cooked fast. The food was at the table before I finished making my drink concoction on the Coke machine. 
The food was fresh and hot. The portion was just enough.
We have now discovered the secret menu and the lemon pepper shrimp is just the right amount of spicy.

This is now one of our go-to places when we don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of the best \"fast\" food/diner places to eat IMHO.  This place serves all quality Chinese/Japanese favorites in a fraction of the time it would take you at PF Changs.

You can get your food to go by using their online order or phone order service.  You can also sit down at a table and enjoy your meal.  They have a few great servers if you have any needs while dining in the restaurant.  Overall, this place is fantastic and I urge everyone to give them a shot."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this chain for about 3 years now.  We go there mostly because the kids like it.  The last few times I have been to this location I have noticed that the people are extraordinarily friendly.  The employs are all smiling and seem to do the little things that make you feel like they care about your business.  We tend not to eat at chains, but the people at this store have a sincere way about them and will walk over to you to make sure you are finding everything okay.  The food is good like you would expect from a Pei Wei.

If you like Chinese American food Pei Wei is a nice mix.  There is always plenty of fortune cookies and chopsticks.  It is a clean place and it is fairly fast, without tasting like fast food.
If your are introducing your children to Chinese Food this is a nice place to start."}
{"text":"Always fresh and good food. The service is also great and fast. I love the location. They also have great coupons if you add your email."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Delicious honey seared shrimp and chicken for me and honey seared shrimp and steak for my husband. So yummy. A stand out star was actually the crab puffs. Amazing!  Regular portion was a very good size. I got the small and it was just perfect."}
{"text":"I constantly hear that this place is similar to PF Changs. I disagree, I think this food is average at best. Its not the worst food I have ever eaten but is far from the best. I had the orange peel chicken with brown rice, The rice tasted a little overdone and the chicken was mediocre. This place sums up another average Asian place."}
{"text":"Always consistent food. Although my chicken Mongolian was lacking in chicken.. Way too many mushrooms. I ordered it to go, and sat too eat a bit, and I had no napkin or fork. I would have been really upset when I got back to work with them missing from my bag. It I'd to go, isn't that a normal thing to add?"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of PF Chang's so when I was introduced to Pei Wei my loyalty changed. Still owned by PF Chang's, you are now offered the same great taste, just at a lower price. They do not offer all the same entrees or offer the same specials but their menu selection is still large. 

Menu- offerings of gluten-free, noodles, salads, chicken, beef and shrimp, lettuce wraps and egg rolls.

Kitchen- every establishment has an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks cook I our food. It's a great reinsurance your old is fresh and cooked to order

Prices- appetizers range from $3- $8 and entrees and salads range from $6- $9. Very inexpensive \"restaurant style\" food with great flavors. 

The staff has always been very friendly and are very accommodating whenever iced tea, forks or napkins are low. After you pay at the counter, employees do serve you your meals and clean your dirty dishes.  It's not fast food so expect to wait about 10 minutes for your food to be cooked and ready to enjoy."}
{"text":"It's easy to forget this location is here. Tucked away between the Safeway and the corresponding gas station is this run-of-the-mill Pei Wei establishment.

I usually order Pei Wei Spicy or Mandarin Kung Pao chicken. Though, Kung Pao beef is surprisingly tasty. Then, I load it up with their chili sauce and spicy mustard. I like to add extra veggies too because they tend to skimp on that. Stay away from the Curry because it's bland and runny to me. 

Tips: Asking for brown rice and steamed chicken make Pei Wei a fairly healthy and tasty alternative. 

Though not the cheapest or most authentic, I'm been a fan of Pei Wei's attempts to stay true to their Asian roots (Pei Wei's Market online) and provide good value with every meal. And, I like the cool touch-screen soda dispensers.

Looking forward to the new Siracha Chicken (arrives Oct 8)!"}
{"text":"It's your basic Pei Wei location and food, however I feel that this location does go the extra mile by being diligent to be clean and organized along with providing friendly and accommodating staff members. They also play great music, and almost every time I've been in there, I've spotted a local news channel anchor or athlete for one of our professional teams. So it's an interesting place for people-watching as well."}
{"text":"Pei Wei has always been a HUGE favorite of mine. I've been to a couple locations in The Valley, but this one I've been going too more than others. I've always ordered online and picked up the food after about 15-20 minutes, and every time it's always there waiting for me! 

Wait time? Hardly! If you do wait, it's a total of maybe 2 minutes? By then you're just walking back from getting your soda from their new touch-screen soda machine. Yeah...it's touch screen. There's so many flavors of drinks in this thing! My favorite is to mix Orange Coca-Cola and Vanilla Coca-Cola. Mmmm, goes great with the Orange Peel Signature dish! 

Aside from the epic soda machine and tiny (if any) wait time, the staff is super friendly, even during its busiest times. And trust me, this place can get packed during the lunch hour. 

PARKING TIP: If you're looking for a parking spot during the lunch hour it's nearly impossible. However, if you park on the north end of the Walgreen's next door (under the trees), there's almost always a spot. If that's full, then the spots at the front of Walgreen's on the east side are always opened. All you have to do is walk around the corner and BAM! You're at Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Don't get the sushi! It was disgusting!!! Honestly, I'd like my money back. It's basically a giant rice ball with questionable fish. Ahí tuna isn't supposed to be this color... That overwhelming taste of the cheap sea weed wrapper! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Wide variety of Asian styles.  Service experience at this location varies widely during lunch.  Food is consistent.  Patio great during day, impossible at dusk."}
{"text":"It's decent chain Asian food at a reasonable price.  Busy and slow on weekend evenings, but great for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Can I give this place zero stars? This location is absolutely horrible in customer service and needs new management. Numerous times have we ordered here to have the order screwed up. Unapologetic and overwhelmed staff are constantly scrambling. Have ordered online 90 minutes in advance to avoid waiting for order only to have to wait over 30 minutes after my order was to supposed to be ready. Website advertises \"Order Online, Skip the wait\". Yeah right. Never again will I go to this place."}
{"text":"What a delicious place to come to for lunch! Whatever I order is always a treat, and don't forget to take some fresh-cut, sweet oranges and Chinese fortune cookies at the side table where they have the utensils and the soft drinks. Also if you have left-overs and need a to-go container, they're located on that same table with the utensils.  I like that they have their chop sticks readily available, right near the forks and spoons. Food service was pretty quick. Didn't have to wait long at all before we were served. Celebrated a friend's birthday there."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my husband. Ordered an appetizer and two main dishes. The main dishes got there before our appetizer. The guy said that they burned it and needed to recook again. Needless to say, they completely forgot about it and had to remind them. We had to wait for them to make some and package it to go. Food quality was fine but service was not good."}
{"text":"Second time in a week we walked in to order and eat and were told it was a 45 minute wait. The restaurant was 25% full. 

Last time I wrote to the GM and received a response that they'd get it fixed. 

I am not going back. How do they stay in business they were loosing customers out the door, including me."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this pei wei was built for the good employees of Vanguard.

Went here for a quick lunch with sister, the place was busy which was nice. The only thing that wasn't nice was how incredibly loud it was inside. I could barely hear my sister talking from across the table, but I could definitely hear all the financial complaints from fellow financial service employees.

The food left a bit to be desired. O ordered my usual orange peel chicken, but what I ended up with was something along the lines of orange peel and vegetables. Maybe 4 pieces of chicken. Really?

The service was quick, but not friendly. The drink station was a mess. Probably won't be re visiting."}
{"text":"One of the employees Hector really went out of his way to make sure everyone had everything they needed, our experience wouldn't have been the same without him thank you!"}
{"text":"Can we please get some better management in here???! Such a shame the pei wei with the worst service is in the best part of Scottsdale!! Stacey helped me today, and she was horrific!! I was waiting in line, and she went to help the last person in line first...don't you help the next person in line?!...I paid, and instead of grabbing my to go order, she starts helping the next person. Can we finish with me and then help the next customer??? I then look at my order to see there's no greens in my pad thai as it should have, so I asked for a side of cilantro since my meal was missing green onions and cilantro...she went back and grabbed it and then embarrassingly told me in front of everyone in the future to order side items when placing my order instead of asking for it when they're busy. I think she may have been the manager, and if so she needs some ethic and management training!!!!!"}
{"text":"We come to Pei Wei almost every Sunday. Today was the first time the service was unsatisfactory. I would excuse this if they were busy but there were only about five tables occupied. Almost all of the unoccupied tables were unclean forcing us to sit on the patio. The unclean tables remained uncleaned for easily twenty five minutes. Not to mention the food took just as long to get out to us as it did for them to clean the dirty tables."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Sure, it's a chain, but good food is good food. Plus, we don't have one where I live. The service was friendly and fast, and the prices were right down my line. I needed to save a few pennies for the casinos. I can't wait to get to another Pei Wei. Hopefully it'll be as god ad this location."}
{"text":"Yawn.... This place used to be amazing. Now over priced like PF Changs. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time going to Pei Wei. It is owned by PF Changs. Immaculant & clean restaurant. Very impressed with the quick service style ambience & loved the decor. I especially liked that the menu was posted on tv's on walls and at each cashier station-never seen that before. Staffed seemed unfriendly, prob bc they wanted to go home & celebrate 4th of July. I saw the chef & expeditor get in a lil argument about an order. A co-worker told them to \"hush\". I enjoyed watching them make my order on the wok. The food was....uhhh...bleh. Got vietnamese caramel chkn & orange chkn and it was salty, salty, salty. Ewhh, how can ppl like this. It should be more on the sweeter side. I did like the edamame, but its always good anywhere. Overall pretty & fun place, but food is not to my par."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience, it was super crowded and it was kinda warm in the restaurant..."}
{"text":"\"Thank you for calling Pei Wei Asian Diner. Please wait as we're assisting other guests\" 

I don't know why on earth this gets repeated over and over and over and over again while you are waiting on the phone. Use a dial tone, use waiting music, use silence, use ANYTHING else. 

There is nothing more annoying than hearing the same sentence repeated over and over on a loop. This needs to be changed 

Food is dank though"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Always clean and good service.  Special thanks today to Brian working the register for honoring a coupon which I thought was valid but had expired.  Really appreciate it and it's that kind of customer service that keeps me coming back (and the kung pao shrimp rolls which I'm totally addicted to!)"}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying I'm not the person who complains at restaurants, never, ever. From 15-27 I worked in the industry at every level imaginable. Point being, I understand the ins and outs; the often unforeseen difficulties and don't feel right complaining to the often underpaid and under appreciated employees. But WTF Pei Wei, I can't take anymore from this location!!!!! 

I've been a loyal Pei Wei supporter for years and years. And now as a father, I love it even more because on top of the usually great food and value, my daughter regularly has leftovers for school lunch; score! However, in three years of frequenting this location 1-2 times per month, I have yet to have a single experience that wasn't somehow flawed. Generally, they are small issues but tonight was just too much. 

-First, I waited for three people to be served in the phone in line, while two employees sat laughing and neither one tended to the growing line of dine in customers. (Ok, breath; the issue is out of the way early and the rest will be smooth sailing, right? No!)

-We go to place our order and learn that they are out of eggrolls and spring rolls. Really? How exactly do you run out of such common items at a large chain? 

-next we proceed to the drinks. The sprite my daughter wanted was out. The coke I wanted was out. I asked if they could be refilled, only to be told immediately, coldly, and with no apology, they were out. As a former manager I understand food cost, unforeseen rushes, space etc. but to run out of coke and sprite???? 

-moving right along... our food arrives! As mentioned, my daughter likes the leftovers for school lunch. So, I always pay extra to get extra chicken in her dish. When it arrived there were a whopping SEVEN pieces of chicken. I politely asked the runner if that was extra chicken. Her response? \"Can I see your receipt\" she saw that I had paid for extra, and said\"well, that looks like extra to me.\" She's had the exact same dish for three years, I know what regular and extra chicken look like. And this, this was barely enough to qualify for regular chicken, let alone the extra I paid for.

-And now, just when I think things can't possibly get any worse comes the real kicker.  About halfway through dinner my daughter predictably needed to use the restroom. Both our bowls were half full. But if that didn't signify we were still there, I was certain that her school book, school papers and pen sitting on the table would have clearly signified we were still there. Yet upon returning to our table, a short 2-3 minutes tops, I watched as the same lady from earlier stacked our food, dishes and trash on top of one another. She  seemed more offended than anything by the fact we were still there. Gone for two minutes, food only half eaten, and a stack of school supplies...WHY IN HOLY HELL would she think we were done?!!!!? So much for finishing the meal I had paid to eat. 

We live less than 90 seconds from this location and have been long time regulars for multiple times a month. Yet despite the proximity and general enjoyment of the Pei Wei chain, we will never return to this location. My business (or lack there of) will have no bearing on their success or failure, I get that. But after overlooking and righting off years of failures on their end, tonight was the giant final straw. There is zero accountability here, zero consistency in the product, and not even a facade of customer service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Mongolian beef and fried rice, and the portions are quite nice for the price you pay. I wish Scottsdale had more varieties of Chinese places to eat at, but Pei Wei comes close to what I am used to from, \"Happy Foods\" off of Thomas and 67th ave."}
{"text":"I dined at Pei Wei this afternoon.  The food was fresh, hot, and delicious.  The employee who assisted me was very pleasant and courteous.  I will return again soon!!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is okay . I am not thrilled by Pei Wei much anymore. There food keeps me full , it's relatively healthy and everybody in the family can find something they like. But as far as earth shaking yummy..nope  ..not here. 
I like that I can get brown rice. I am pleased that I get veggies in my food. But the flavors are overdone and some seem sticky sweet. 

BTW , Pei Wei if you want customers to feel welcomed you might want to great them , and take their orders instead of sitting  and talking .  We waited for quite a bit while one hostess took phone orders and two other gals sat and talked ."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with the Pei Wei chain. Before this place opened I would go to the Gainey Ranch location because I love their patio and when the food was right it was all good relaxing on the patio. But I discovered that they were inconsistent where sometimes I would like their food and other times I wouldn't like it. 

So the wife thought it would be a good idea to abandon our normal Chinese place to try Pei Wei during their first week of operation. They had about 10 cooks woking up a storm and unfortunately I drew the short straw when it came to picking the cook to make my dinner. The meat was tough and inedible. I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore. 

Luckily I was able to crawl back to our Chinese place and let them know that they didn't have to worry about Pei Wei taking away any of their customers."}
{"text":"I've been to Pei Wei a couple of times over the last couple of weeks and probably about five times over the last year. I love the outdoor seating area and the orange slices you can put in your drink as well as the portion sizes. I also like that their dinners with a drink are about $10 dollars. 

I don't like the inconsistency of their food. I had Kung Pao chicken with white rice and it tasted good, especially for ten dollars. At the next visit,  the Kung Pao chicken seemed to be overcooked and just meh. This is like free throw shooting in basketball where two out of two free throws made will win the game. Sorry, one out of two doesn't get it done for me."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and stopped here after my first choice didn't work out. I know Pei Wei isn't the best food but honestly I don't remember it being this bad. I should have left when I had a hard time finding clean silverware in the silverware bin. I picked about 6 forks before I could find one without paper stuck to it.

I soon receive my Ginger Broccoli with Chicken. It didn't look bad but the taste was just like really BAD Asian Buffet Food. The sauce tasted like very salty soy sauce mixed with an artificial chemically flavored sweet syrup of some sort kind. I didn't taste any ginger at all in this dish. I don't know what they did to the broccoli but it tasted super strong like maybe it was decomposing. The chicken was passable and better than spongy fake whipped with filler chicken from the Subway Chain. They gave me enough rice to feed four people but it was polluted from that not good tasting sauce.

When I hear Pei Wei I will say NO WAY!

Never Again"}
{"text":"In a word: decent. This is the salty variety of Asian food with canned-tasting sauces and meat. It's about as good as the frozen dinners you can get at the grocery store, but it costs more."}
{"text":"Good food. Way too chaotic!  Very loud. Nowhere to sit because tables aren't bused. Half the price of PF Chang's but miss the ambiance."}
{"text":"I literally ordered two entrees and they couldn't get them both right..my sister doesn't eat meat so we asked for tofu for her and she got meat. The cashier didn't even ring in my order right and I guess the cooks can't read either. Not coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Forget the lettuce for my to go lettuce wraps once, shame on you. Forget them twice, shame on me. The third time and Pei Wei is officially dead to me. Awful service and I was promised a credit for my jacked up un-lettuce wraps that has yet to happen. And I tried to call. Three times. And all three times some airhead hung up on me. Unacceptable. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai lunch size with shrimp. Food was delicious, service was prompt, staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. They constantly mess up my orders. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Food is good but I feel they skimp on the servings more now than ever before. Granted I ordered the \"lunch size\" but for $7.00 I expect more than a few bites of chicken on 3 cups of rice. 

Their egg rolls are absolutely delicious and if you care to be healthy the spring rolls are a great option. I always order my meat steamed instead of fried and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Love to call in my order, show up 10 minutes later and they are bagging it for me! Fast, fresh and delicious every time. 
I spotted a new item that looks like a must-try, Thai mango. It looks amazing! 
Today we had the Sesame shrimp (has a little kick) and Honey chicken (always a hit with the little ones). 
To beef up the healthy scale I always order my chicken steamed and extra veggies for .99. 
Can't beat it for good flavorful Chinese. 2 entrees feeds 4."}
{"text":"Tried to address my concerns with customer service but they do not care. I emailed them but never got a response. I have been a customer for years and have never had a problem until recently. I ordered teriyaki chicken with extra veggies and chicken. I paid extra for this however what I received was less than a regular. I probably spend $100 or more a month at this establishment but never again. Pei Wei lost a customer; I do not recommend eating here. Attached is the picture of.

4/5/18- customer service replied to this review with a bad url to contact customer support. I already contacted customer support to no avail."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place or me when I am wanting something simple, easy and quick.
I have been several times and it is totally great for what it is.
What is it? It is PF Chang's version of Fast Food, but with good fresh ingredients.

You can basically build your own food, which is kind of interesting. You choose the sauce, noodle, protein, etc. The service is ALWAYS friendly and fun, which I really appreciate! Each dish runs about $10, depending on how you build it. Certain ingredients cost more, you get the picture.

Last time I was these I saw a couple sharing a large noodle dish and a couple apps, family style. This looked brilliant to me! I have always been a fan of the apps here, but don't order them because that and a bowl of noodles is just too much food for me personally. But sharing sounds like the way to go! 
Well, when I am not there sitting alone! LOL"}
{"text":"Took an hour to get my food! Ingredients missing from rice dish, food came out cold and undercooked.
Would not come back."}
{"text":"Pei wei spicy is my go to meal.  I sometimes order it stock velveted (steamed)  not sure why but the spicy mustard is no longer self serve.  The service is usally pretty good."}
{"text":"Great fast food sit down Asian food.  I always order the Pei Wei spicy with chicken and brown rice.  When I am trying to keep calories down I ask for stock velveted chicken.  My two boys love the Teriyaki Chicken and my Wife will usually get a beef or shrimp dish.   They have the new fangled coke machines where you can mix the flavors until you heart is content and they also serve beer and wine.  It's like PF Chang's little brother."}
{"text":"Argh. First time to this location. 6:30 Thursday pm. No sushi. No silverware. No water cups. Service like McDonald's counter. Never again!"}
{"text":"Lo mein was completely tasteless the orange chicken was cook really weird and your crab wonton was not good.

Although the service was acceptionally decent I will not return for the food"}
{"text":"We order a lot from here because it's convenient but I have to say our order is NEVER correct.  We always say we aren't ordering from them anymore but over her in Summerlin unless you want fast food there is no where close to get take out.  When the food is correct it's very good and fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered some food to go after a long day of work and a long drive home. When I get there they said we need to re put in the order it's not on here.  I drove almost 25 min out of my way to get food here for my family.  Terrible service"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of my weekday lunch time hot spots. The staff is always friendly - automatic three stars. The food is good, just what you'd expect from a restaurant like this, but not amazing. The missing star is because of taste. Each dish could use just a little more umph in the flavor."}
{"text":"Love it. I get my Pad Thai dinner takeout fix a few times a week here. I have to say their to-go packing accuracy is 100%- which is often a rarity when ordering complex or specialty items at other fast casual establishments. Thanks team!"}
{"text":"I usually come to this location and have a great experience. But tonight was really not the best. They ran out of appetizers and seating was not organized."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for an early lunch or an early dinner before heading to a movie. Decent location for the chain with the typical offerings. The parking lot here can be a little tricky with it being inside of a fairly busy complex - so I recommend coming here at off times instead of trying to be a part of the lunch rush. 

The staff is always friendly and the food comes out hot and as ordered each time. They seem to be able to keep up with the rushes by keeping the tables clean and ready for the next guest, which is always nice. A fair number of people seem to get to-go from here, which may be due to all of the local businesses in the area and people wanting to take their meals back to the office, which means that there are almost always seats available in the main area, despite the number of cars outside.  

Definitely a place we'll hit up again for a quick bite."}
{"text":"We've heard of Pei Wei, but had not tried it in Los Angeles. What a lovely treat.

Friends directed us to the restaurant on Dysart. Very easy to find at the corner of a strip mall. Limited parking. The shops that surround the Avondale location are very busy. 

Anyway, we found a spot, and proceeded into a world of soft lighting. The dining area is composed of dark wood and black leather booths. Sleek. Clean. Minimalist artwork. 

Following the signs we ordered our meal, then self seated. Collected silverware and condiments along the back wall. Waited for our food to be delivered to our table.

We started with crab filled won tons nestled in a garlic, ginger, red pepper sauce. Luscious.

Followed by two pork-filled egg rolls with a delicate mustard dipping sauce. Yum.

Two entrees: (1) Chicken sauteed in teriyaki sauce with spinach greens, carrots, cabbage and onions; (2) Beef and broccoli tossed with Mongolian garlic sauce. Both meat dishes served over a bed of white rice. Tasty. Beautiful array of colors and textures.

We ordered way too much food for two people. We could have shared one entree and appetizers.

My only minor complaint . . . too much sauce over powers the flavorful meat and veggies. Next time I'll ask for sauce on the side.

Otherwise what a delightful surprise to find a bit of Asia in Arizona."}
{"text":"I really like this place because the prices are good (Not cheap, but not expensive), the food is consistent and comes in big portions and they have a soda machine of the future. I think the soda machine alone is worth me stopping by here on my way home. 

Peach Fanta anyone?"}
{"text":"The best customer service EVER!  General manager Ron was concerned about my experience and offered up great advice to fix my order now and from a previous experience. I was so caught off guard about the genuine concern. No wonder why this is my favorite location. Can't be beat."}
{"text":"This location has dirty tables that need to be bussed most of the time. Also lack of forks. Please hire adequate staff!

One week later... There is no more staff. The picturpatrons are picking up dirty dishes and moving tables.

The online form they keep asking me to fill out takes a bunch of my time. I think dirty tables and pictures says it all."}
{"text":"I live near by and do love the food from Pei Wei but the service, organization and management could use a ton of help. It seems the staff is minimally trained and I have had multiple wrong to-go orders or the service is slow because they are trying to fix someone else's messed up order. Almost every time I come in here there is an issue with my order or someone else's."}
{"text":"For the 1st time ever i tried PEI WEI. Heard some bads and some goods and i figured i would give it a try for myself. Let me start off by saying Deandre that works the register provided excellent customer service and was very helpful in helping me select a meal since i had no idea what to pick. He recommended the Thai Dynamite shrimp and steak. Unfortunately i would have to give my meal a 4/10 shrimp was great and so was the flavoring. The white rice was mushy in some parts and clumped together in others. The steak was more like beef jerky. was very over cooked and crunchy around the edges. Worst of all there was a lot of grease left at the bottom of the tray. Maybe this was just a bad day for the cook. Not throwing this place out of the books quite yet. I'll give it another shot, just not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Why would anyone ever go to PF Changs again?

Honestly.

Same food.  Consistent quality.  Clean, quick, cheap.... what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming to Pei Wei at least once a week.  Food is always great and service is fast."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei, but this location needs help. The food is okay, but not to par with other locations. The attitude of the staff is very poor. The young lady that took my order needed a serious attitude adjustment. When I tried to order some wontons, she said they were out. No problem, but then she went on to say that I should have read the sign by the door. I explained that I came in a different door not the door she pointed to. That is when I got the eyeroll. When I was placing my order I let her know I was enrolled in their rewards program. I asked if she wanted my number and she said not until the end of the order. She never asked, and when I mentioned it I got the second eyeroll. I would like to make a suggestion to the manager, put people on the register who are polite and want to work there. Second suggestion would be to the young lady, if you dislike your job and waiting on people find a different job."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I work right next store so usually a call in my order they have my number and previous order save so if I need to just quickly reorder I have the option. Their meals and food are fairly priced. I finally started getting the kids meal because it's so cheap and a ton of food still. 

I recommend the teriyaki chicken and the mango roll. The sushi is delicious, not fancy starlike you'd find it a sushi bar but for what it is and how cheap it is it's delicious and recommended."}
{"text":"Just ate at this Pei Wei location for the first time tonight and I was impressed! 

Was spotless, service was prompt and the food was flavorful and fresh. 

No need to go into details as its all been stated below and most people know what they will get on the menu at a Pei Wei. It's PF Changs faster, cheaper and more casual sibling. I love the spicy Thai chicken wraps & the caramel chicken signature dish. The caramel chicken is spicy and reminds me of the classic General Tso plate at Chinese restaurants. The crab dumplings are also delicious as are the pork egg rolls. I also like the Asian beer selection. 

The manager at this location is doing a great job. The place was busy, the phone was ringing off the hook and the line was 5 - 6 deep most of the time and yet they still pumped out some damn good food with attentive service. 

Will stop back when I am on this side of town."}
{"text":"1st! Place is not closed. There was an issue with legal workers in the franchise chain. Now they are back! Food is one of the best! Especially their chicken mango! Daughter is a huge PF Chang fan, so she loves this place also! Her favorite is their Mongolian beef, and noodles! They are always coming up with something new, so you may have to try them more then a few times."}
{"text":"Pei Wei makes me sad.  Sad because it is literally the ONLY \"Chinese\" food a downtown resident of the 5th largest city in the country can get for lunch on a lazy hungover Sunday afternoon.

:-("}
{"text":"Same consistent quality and service, just like locations in ca, San Marcos and others.

Good for group of 8.

Prices are reasonable, you can order a few items and try it all, family style.
Prices $8 to $15 range."}
{"text":"The hubs and I dined at the Glendale location about two years ago. i guess we were hoping it was like PF Chang's....but unfortunately were dissapointed.

We discovered the Surprise location a couple weeks ago and decided that tonight we would grab a quick bite. The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my \"tried and true\" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken.\" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!

Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...

As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. 

Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise! (or they have a patio you can dine from)"}
{"text":"what..the...heck..is...that...SMELL???!!! I nearly puked! had to leave.hope you guys don't have a gas leak or something. geesh. get that FIXED!"}
{"text":"I love their spicy choices, It's fast and freshly cooked . I always order mine with extra vegetables. Sometimes they charge a $1 for this. Thai Dynamite chicken is one one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Love the food here , if I don't have time to make it to PF Chang's . There prices are less expensive and the taste is on point. If you love P.F. Chang's you have to try there smaller store."}
{"text":"John at the cashier is awesome! I don't come here often and he helped me choose the perfect meal to satisfy both my sweet and spicy side! He has extraordinary customer service. It was a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"There should be 2 1/2 stars because the food was horrible and has not been so good the last few times I've been there. Services good. place is clean and nice"}
{"text":"Completely disgusting I was served a dish filled with hot pepper! Was able to get a refund but sadly I think they should have done more. I will never return. The excuse  of a \"new chef\" shouldn't be my problem. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"ordered take out the other night. got home and only half my order was in the bag! :( thankfully I live super close and they were super nice and apologetic.

 I am a regular and this never happens, therefore no big deal. the girls who work there are always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here and got dinner to go. We ordered: Pei Wei Original (formerly Pei Wei Spicy)
Snap peas, carrots, scallions and garlic, wok-seared in a sweet and spicy chile vinegar sauce.
and
Pork Egg Rolls
The only veggies in mine were steamed broccoli and hubby had no veggies at all. Needless to say we will not return."}
{"text":"I was looking for something light for dinner after shopping at the Trader Joe's across the street. I stopped here and ordered the Korean steak lettuce wraps. I was expecting small strips of steak with a spicy sauce and some veggies and a stack of iceberg lettuce to wrap the filling with. The first surprise was that the beef was just coarsely ground meat, not strips of beef. The second surprise was the sauce. It was not spicy, but it was oily. The veggies did seem fresh. The portion was just right for a light dinner and was a little over $8 with tax. 

The ordering process was odd. You stand in a line and place your order with a person behind a counter (not intuitive since the cash registers are not visible). The take-out area is part of the same section of counter, so it feels confusing and cluttered with people milling around waiting for take-out while other people are placing their orders. The kitchen is open and once you place your order you are supposed to figure out where to go next. I walked into the open dining area to look for a table and stopped by the soda station to get a glass of water. I couldn't find the napkins. I found a table and put my number on the table. A young man brought my food to the table once it was ready and got me some napkins (it turns out they were toward the back of the soda station). When I was done I couldn't figure out where to put my trash and plate. I watched for a few minutes and looks like they have staff to bus the tables. So this seems to be some hybrid between fast food self-serve and a sit-down restaurant.

The place seems clean. The staff was polite but I never saw a smile nor welcoming word from anyone. Parking is close to the door. I'm not sure there is anything here to prompt me to return."}
{"text":"I always try something new here and I am never disappointed. I got the Chicken Dan Dan noodles (which was wonderful). I also love ordering the Crab Wontons, Spicy Chicken, Thai Dynamite, and sometimes they offer Carmel Chicken (my favorite). Needless to say we are regulars here."}
{"text":"dinner last night here was very filling. it was my very first time here and i am sure to be a returning customer. i had no cravings last night so my boyfriend decided he was craving some pei wei. once he knew i never been it was for sure we were going. for the two of us with two entrees, crab wontons (4), and cups of water the total was right under $20.00. I had the tofu and veggie teriyaki bowl with steamed brown rice. It came out in a huge bowl overflowing of colorful veggies. The tofu was thinly sliced and reminded me of mushrooms covered in some addicting sauce. the veggies cookies just right with huge pieces of bright green broccoli and an overload of green snap peas. the steamed brown rice was so soft and went just right with the mix of everything. I stole a crab wonton and was surprised with how much crab was actually stuffed in that little pastry. the spicy sweet sauce they were sat up on went perfect with it enough to make me want to eat all 4 of them, but i know i had to share with Dan T. I couldn't be greedy.
I was pleased with my first time pei wei dine. I did wish they had the heat on though because it was very chilly inside. chilly enough i didn't want to drink my water. that was the only downside for dining in there. I loved the food though and am pleased to have leftovers for days now in my little take out box."}
{"text":"I tried many things on the menu and the one thing I really liked was the Thai Coconut curry on rice noodle. Guess what they no longer sell?

Guess who is no longer going there?"}
{"text":"I like pei wei. This one is just ok otherwise they would have got 5 stars. You pretty much know what you are getting with this chain restaurant. This one seems pretty lax on their cleaning though. Multiple times now I have shown up and all the tables are dirty and filled with plates. Get with it management."}
{"text":"I wrote my initial review too soon. 
Let me begin again. I have been coming to this location since around 2007. I have never had any issues. Always mediocre semi fast Asian-ish food. 
Tonight was a night like any other, I called and ordered our food like I usually do, I pick it up and go home. All seems well. 
I open the containers and am less than thrilled. 
The fried rice is clumped together in balls and not covered in sauce. The egg is burnt and stinks. 
Chow mein looks bland but ok, I take a bite... what is even more bland then bland you ask..... this chow mein. The \"chicken\" if that's what it actually was, was hard and dry and inedible, as if it had been re heated 10x over. The shrimp I had added looked as if they had once been battered but now looked like slime covered yuck. 
My instant pack ramen noodles have more flavor and I am pissed I wasted my money and even more pissed that I purchased food to feed my family including my children and this was the garbage I was given. 
I'm not sure what happened to this place suddenly but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is consistently fast and delicious. My only complaint is feeling rushed out by the bussers and waiters taking plates from underneath us when we're not quite done. I feel that is very rude. It doesn't happen there often, but it has happened more than once."}
{"text":"This is my very mostest favorite Pei Wei!  Food is THE BEST.

I don't know why, but this particular location makes the BEST Pei Wei food.  Perhaps it's the incredible volume of business that they turn everyday~ they've truly got the magic touch.

I am a regular there for lunch, at least once a week.  It is almost always crazy busy.  They are efficient and friendly.

The food is always prepared well.  You THINK a chopped chicken salad is the same here as at other Pei Wei's?  NOT SO, my friend!   THIS one knows just how long to poach it, debone and deskin it, and the proper dice.  It is always a sublime salad experience.

Whatever your favorite PeiWei dish is, it will be prepared better at this location.  

Parking here can be a bear, but there is a lot across the street for overflow traffic- southeast corner of 7th Av and McDowell.

Go.  But go after 1pm, when I'm gone."}
{"text":"So I'm in Phoenix on a business trip and it's not often you see a Pei Wei, so when you do you gotta take advantage. Unfortunately this one is not up to par with some of the others. Quick service,  but not very friendly. ..no greeting, just waddya have?  All out of red wine, but that's okay they had white.  No exhibition kitchen bar seating?!?!? What?? Many other Pei Wei's have this and they service their customers just fine,  and it's fun to sit up there and watch the preparation. Food was just okay...typically the orange chicken is really good and the chicken chunks have been cut carefully to remove the excess \"junk\" before the fry....not here....whoever is cutting the chicken here is lazy and the result is a product that resembles what you would get at a one-off, struggling Chinese restaurant. Not the typical quality of Pei Wei that you would expect. Whole restaurant lacked pizazz and fun. Love Pei Wei as a chain,  but this one needs a little recharge/refocus."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here after a long drive.  Good service and the employees were friendly and the cooks were really working hard.  Got my food fast and it was great! Will come back!"}
{"text":"* download the APP for a FREE ENTREE with the purchase of a drink *

We really like Pei Wei. They have a wonderful variety and the icing on the cake is that everything is FRESH and made to order!

You can expect a clean environment and friendly staff, which brings my rating up to 5 stars.

Oh, and you can't beat that $5 orange chicken bowl. My three kids share two of them."}
{"text":"The reason I am leaving a two star review is for this location only! And it's not about the food which is disappointing! It's about the service or lack there of, I'm hoping by leaving this review this location will learn to change somethings. 

This is the closest location to our house and normally we never have any issues! However about a month ago my husband and I went for dinner on a Wednesday night at 7:30, I wouldn't say it was busy but they had a ton of to go orders. The girl taking orders tells us because we had a toddler with us that it's a 30 minute wait for dine in, we sat thinking no way it's going to be that long. Long behold 30 minutes goes by and we finally get our food. We thought maybe this was a one off so Home we went. About two weeks later we go again on a Sunday and again the same girl is there and we see people begin to leave. Same thing 30 minute wait. We ended up leaving as well as this is frustrating for a fast food Chinese establishment. It also seems that they take their to go orders on a higher level than customers in person. 

I then had my neighbor tell me she stopped by on her way home, same story so again she left. She also said multiple people were leaving as well. 

While I appreciate the heads up there is no reason a fast food restaurant should take 30 minutes to deliver you food. Obviously there is some staffing issues and we've only ever had this issue at this location. And it's unbecoming that no one seems to care that customers leave without ordering."}
{"text":"My all time fav.. i eat here very frequently and i am in love with there flavors.  Its neat and clean .
Food is fresh ."}
{"text":"Although I was looking for their salad rolls, i found a new menu item, their ahi avocado salad bowl.  OMG! So delicous, although only a scoop of tuna, there was a lot of lettuce, avocado, great wasabi vinagrette, fried wontons(didn't eat or sprinkle) for only $8....I think their sushi is overpriced though for what is served...I like the variety and the online ordering, too. + love their rewards program...."}
{"text":"Bad customer service.  I literally sat and waited for my food my entire lunch and some more. On top of that I tried to order online before hand and it would not allow me to. It said that the online service was not available at the selected location. I attempted to get help and see how long my food would take but the young lady behind the register was not only not helpful but rude. You had all these \"managers\" standing around doing nothing. The manager in a pink shirt kept reaching and helping himself to drinks instead of helping the line smh"}
{"text":"Pei Wei falls into the \"you know what you're going to get\" section of my dining life. It is good, quick, tasty food at a reasonable price. It is a great place to grab a quick meal. Speaking of quick, sometimes my food comes out to my table before I am done getting myself a self serve drink. They don't waste any time. I am particularly fond of their noodle dishes recently which come in a huge bowl and are usually enough for two meals for me."}
{"text":"Love the soda machine. The egg rolls are pretty good too. Mostly this place is mediocre with the coolest soda machine ever. 
Plenty of the kids who work the register are inept too."}
{"text":"The food was gross. I ordered online and got Mongolian beef with white rice, hot and sour soup, and sweet and sour chicken.
Mongolian beef was okay, the rice was hard. The sweet and sour chicken was inedible. Rarely do I waste food but I didn't even eat half of the \"meat\" (it was mostly batter), there was barley any sauce so what was edible was extremely dry. The soup was fine, over salted but at least it was edible.
This was my first time trying Pei Wei and it'll be my last. I could've gotten better food at a gas station. Waste of money and time.


...Now visit #2. Just enough to go up to two stars. Boyfriend got Kung pao chicken and it was dry and flavorless with hard rice. I got the honey chicken which we surprisingly good! I asked for extra sauce on the side and that was a good choice because alone it was a little dry. I would get that again if I ever go back to a Pei Wei. That honey chicken is the reason I went up one star. We also got snicker doodles because we LOVE snicker doodles and they look great. Look great, yes, but the taste is bland with a gnarly after taste that is NOT a snicker doodle. Pretty bummed. I want to love it but alas, another disappointment."}
{"text":"The food is good, but if you're in a hurry and want to order take-out, don't come here.  Even on nights when there is hardly any one in the place, the service is extremely slow.   The prices are too high for a take-out diner too.  The only saving grace is that if I order the \"large\" portion, I can get two meals out of it."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a sucker for Pei Wei.  When we lived in California, I heard the place was shut down.  Glad to move back and see it open.  

Take out rocks, call ahead.  They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much! 

The only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.  Otherwise, I could eat here daily.  Find me here at least once a week! :)"}
{"text":"This location is one of the best I've been to. Customer service is great and the food is consistent.

I've been obsessed with their pad Thai for years and get it almost every time. Definitely try the lettuce wraps and crab wontons! 

Download the app! Once you spend $100 you get a free entree! Plus they send you coupons all the time for 33%, buy one get one 1/2 and $5 bowls. 

For the negative... I ordered $100+ food for my family through the app expecting it to be done in 45 minutes. Get there and they said they never received it and the app doesn't work that great for ordering. I was upset because I had to wait an hour for dinner. Sucked but I do understand that technology isn't always the greatest!"}
{"text":"Good quality, Great service at a very decent price ! What else do you want ? Some other places charge twice as much for horrible food and no smiles ! Here it is the opposite, so keep it simple, good and keep up the great service ! Thanks great team !"}
{"text":"Edenyk and Ruben helped me today... First time I met Edenyk-- you'll fit right in he's awesome too. Actually he did something very special for me today which I appreciate. They have such a good attitude I couldn't believe it. If there is ever an error they for sure will take care of you! 

I would like to thank Sergio, he is the chef!!

Go there and join the Rewards Club free entree after 100 points only. Great Deal!"}
{"text":"I saw a post about how the service goes down when they are busy.....and I agree! Ordered online, it was about 10 minutes overdue (change the pick up time!), and then the fried rice had lumps of rice......just not worth the price.  And, rude counter help doesn't help at all....."}
{"text":"I love pei Wei, never a long wait at this location, food is always good and everyone is always friendly. 

Not a huge fan of their sushi but that's because they're not a sushi place. But it's still not bad."}

{"text":"SKIMPY PORTIONS - 
I don't usually care about portion size - but this was ridiculous - 
$7.50 for 7 tiny 'chicken nuggets' - $1 for each tiny chicken nugget...and rest of plate 80% bland rice....
No....
NO.....
NO....not good."}
{"text":"This used to be a great spot to go when I was out running errands, haven't been in over a year. I was in the area and decided to pop in tonight. Complete disappointment. Ordered out appetizers and food, the male cashier was great..the female however stood around while he had a line past the door. Sat down - the table next to us was dirty upon arrival, the place was a mess, drinks spilled on the floor, & no silverware! We got our food extremely quick, the soup was cold everything else was decent. I had asked the man who served us for silverware..he never came back. I had to ask the cashier for plasticware and the table across from us ended up using chopsticks. My son had accidentally spilled his drink, it was all over the both of us not their problem I know. However, I had asked the lazy female at the front for a manager and a towel. Waited around for a manager, never ended up getting help to clean up our seats. The manager ended up being the guy who served us and never brought back silverware! He said he never brought it back because he had other food to serve that he couldn't let get cold?! So I am supposed to let me food get cold because the place has no silverware?! WTF! He offered a refund I ended up accepting because I was a little disgusted that even the manager himself was making excuses. This place has become an absolute mess, save your time and your money..go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Gluten free was NOT gluten free.  My daughter threw up for hours after eating the sweet/sour chicken....was told it was gluten free when we asked."}
{"text":"Pei Wei should consider a significant management change for this location. I work very close to this location for over a year. Within that time I have probably visited this location at least 15 times. Not once have I experienced what I would consider good service. From the place being disgusting with food on floor and tables and birds eating from plates on the tables outside covered in bird droppings, to extremely long wait times. No one EVER answers the phone for a telephone order and when I walk in to place an order to go I hear the telephone ringing consistently and no one makes any effort to answer. I'm fed up enough to make this post so I'm pretty sure this is my last visit to Pei Wei Raintree. GET IT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"It would probably be good if they picked up the phone when we. Call to order after four attempts calling no answer and they have no online ordering. So not getting our business."}
{"text":"Ordered online website said food would be ready at 10:45 and that they opened at 10:45 NOT TRUE!!!! Opened st 11 food not ready until 11:15 normally wouldn't care but needed to get food to work by 11:30  Food was plated but no one bagged it until I insisted Can't blame cashier she was busy but manager and other employee just walking around"}
{"text":"I haven,t eaten at Pei Wei in a while because I didn,t really care for it the first couple of times but I decided to give it another try. 

Our luncheon visit was not inspiring but adequate.  We ordered the Honey Seared Chicken and Mongolian Beef, both entrée's were good. Both our  portions were ample and  had a good flavor.  The Honey Seared Chicken was all white meat and included rice sticks, scallions, and red peppers. The Mongolian beef had scallions and mushrooms. The entrees were okay for a fast food establishment. However, the brown rice was not cooked thoroughly and lacked any flavor

Pei Wei is a fast/casual concept with moderate prices. It is not a destination venue but if you are pressed for time, you could do much worse."}
{"text":"Good food , just make sure you go early of you plan to go on a Friday night ! They get quite busy !"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, good prices, clean, casual atmosphere. What else do you need? We will definitely be back. Please have the lettuce wraps ready!"}
{"text":"45 minute wait for a take out order. Tried calling it in, but now I see why it didn't work. Even the manager is ignoring the phone."}
{"text":"Pei Wei = PF Changs - $10. Basically, if you like Changs, you will like Pei Wei. I am personally a huge fan and have never been disappointed over my many visits. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was a customer here...not anymore.  Experienced slow service then when the food arrived the quality was poor including raw chicken.  Spoke to the manager and he had an attitude."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised you actually increased the chicken portions to the small and regular sizes.  I could actually see that the meat portions were the stars of the entrees...but...you may want to cook the rice a little bit longer, they were slightly undercooked.  I make enough rice at home to last me a week every week so I do know how to cook rice especially sometimes when I like to add quinoa.  I bought these two different size portions when you had the Sweet & Sour Chicken Specials (BOGOs), let's see how long you continue to serve the correct portions in each size."}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. 

My husband and I split shrimp with brown rice in a honey glaze. We added some veggies and asked to have it all steamed. It came out yummy and plentiful for less than $12! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is always frustrating... order and get home to find I didn't get what I ordered. Ordered Mongolian steak over egg noodles and got white rice. Consistency at this location does not exist."}
{"text":"Love this place, watching weight can eat healthy here. Ginger Broccoli no rice light sauce and add extra veggies"}
{"text":"My daughter loves the honey chicken. Wish there were some healthier options."}
{"text":"Great Lunch or Dinner spot! The restaurant is clean, organized & at a great location. The food is excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. I love their Online ordering option for pick up! If you go around lunch, the line can be insanely long BUT on the plus side- instead of having customers fend for themselves waiting for an open table, they have a seating/clean up system set up that I find impressive!  That's what I call customer service!! I recommend sitting out on the patio if weather permits.

When getting your drinks- be sure to check out their fancy soda machine! = )  This may be silly but I especially love that they offer orange slices, as well as lemon slices for your water! Not many places have that so that makes me super happy! :D Also- I can't be the only one who's impressed with how sturdy and nice their napkins are? No cheap, flimsy napkins here! 

FOOD time! HmMmmm..  Here are a few things I will order repeatedly: If you want something lighter, I suggest the Traditional Chicken Lettuce Wraps (they have a lot of other lettuce wraps options now), I like their Hot & Sour Soup & Crab Wontons. For a noodle dish, my favorite is probably Chicken Pad Thai. Be sure to add some of the chili paste in there for a bit more kick! Their fried rice is yummy if you want something \"basic\". From their Signature dishes, I enjoy Caramel Chicken, Mongolian Beef & Orange Peel Chicken. For those of you who must eat Gluten-Free- they got you covered!! 

 I would definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My family almost never goes out to eat, but when we do, this Pei Wei is always a top pick!  

We don't want to break the bank for dinner out, we just want some good food and a chance to enjoy each other's company.  Seeing as I'm vegan but the rest of my family isn't, it can be difficult to settle on a restaurant that we all find appealing.  Pei Wei is great, they have a relatively decent selection of dishes that can be made vegetarian or vegan.  (I always order the Spicy Korean with vegetables, tofu, and rice noodles...yummmmm!!!!)

What I appreciate about the service here is that the employees always take my vegan requests and inquiries seriously, and if they don't personally know the answers, they're sure to ask someone else who does.  The one time I stopped in for take-out, everyone was so nice and engaged in friendly conversation while I waited for my order.  It can get quite busy here around dinner time, but even so, we always manage to find a table because the employees act really quickly to clean up tables as soon as diners leave.

I don't give out 5 stars to just anybody...this location totally earned my highest praise when we had a mix-up with our order at one recent visit.  My husband's teriyaki dish came to him with some veggies he'd specifically requested be left out.  Not one to make a big deal out of these things, he just mildly and politely sent it back and asked that he get his plain chicken teriyaki, as originally ordered.  As we waited for his meal, the manager came to our table with the \"mix-up\" dish all boxed up and bagged and asked if we would like to take it with us to eat later (at no charge, obviously).  He apologized for the inconvenience and gave us a $10 gift card for our next visit, which was totally unexpected.  My husband's new dish came out quickly and everything was wonderful.  I wish I would have taken note of the manager's name so I could mention him here...for a fast-food-type chain, the customer service we received at this location went above and beyond.  

Nothing bad to say about this Pei Wei, whatsoever!  5-star establishment, for sure!"}
{"text":"This location needs to do something to improve service. First of all they don't answer their phone. I usually try to call ahead to place my order so that it is ready when I arrrive. When I call, the just continues to ring until it automatically disconnects. Then when I go in to order, on two occasions I have had to wait 45-60 minutes for a simple order. 

I really like the food, but they need to do something to increase staffing during high demand times. 

They also want to check their location on Google Maps. It is stating \"permanently closed\". Maybe that is a trick to keep the customers away so they can handle their volumes in a more timely manner."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday evening. It was a nice time to show up since most of the tables were empty. Food can out fast and fresh. Our server as friendly. Seems like a nice relaxed asmosphere. My only peeve about this location and shopping strip is the lack of parking for all establishments around, virtually zero parking during peak hours. In fact, the only reason why we stopped here when craving Asian is because there were several parking spots directly in front of the entrance. By the time we left the whole parking lot was full and a jerk with an suv he has no business driving, parked so close and crooked next to me I had a hard time backing out. I hate their parking, but I'm not gonna dock them a star for something they have no control over. :/"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't even eat it, really that bad, order a chocolate cookie as well and even that was not good. Should've followed my first mind and went somewhere else"}
{"text":"Pei Wei what can I say? I had a cash back deal on this place and decided to try it out. Well.. the food was okay but the service was terrible. I should be giving it two stars but the food quality bumped them up to three. I decided to place an order online since nobody picked up the phone after about 15 rings. I had to check the website to make sure they were even open. at least pick up and say you're busy. Once I placed the order online I received an email with the time that my food would be ready. Once I arrived I paid for my food and waited an additional 20 minutes past what was disclosed on the confirmation e-mail. When I addressed the situation with the cashier she never apologized but only said \"oh well they messed up on your order that's why it's not ready\" as I sat and patiently waited angry with other people I would've walked out if I wouldn't have already paid. They have a lot of room for improvement because it just wasn't a good look to see the other To-Go orders have issues as well. From the sounds of it that night they ran out of a lot of products and weren't even offering anything as a substitute. Yikes.. Not sure I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Today we came in for a nice & fun lunch however that was not the case. We ordered chicken with lettuce cups as the side, but the lady looked at me & my family as if we ordered something foreign. She then argued that they are called lettuce wraps (which are a completely different item!!). My father ordered 4 wontons& the lady out in 2 orders of 4.... WHAT THE HECK??? Then they were out of Diet Coke & root beer. To top it off the table was sticky & dirty! Besides all the wrong the food actually good!"}
{"text":"Note to employees of Pei Wei: when I order online and give an empty restaurant 30 min to make 1 dish don't act surprised when I come in to pick it up and you clearly haven't started it. 

Note to management: to increase customer satisfaction you could teach your employees that when they forget to make an order they can offer something to the customer such as a free drink, a cookie, extra meat, etc. It would go a long way. 

Why 2 stars? Because I love the food."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for the first time and loved it!  I had the Thai chicken lettuce wraps and my husband had the orange peel chicken.  We shared a sushi roll.  The food was all very fresh and delicious.  I liked that they had so many healthy options to pick from.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Prolly a 3.5 stars. 
Ordered -
Thai Dynamite : just some veggies sautéed with soy and served with brown rice. Idk if it any special though.

Ambience is great and service was quick. Rating just coz of the food.. Its just meh."}
{"text":"I usually go to pei wei regularly and am usually over all satisfied.  However today did not go well . First I was unable to order online,   when I  went to pick up the food I brought  a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal. When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket. 
The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for? 
BUYER BEWARE..."}
{"text":"Everyone knows about Pei Wei right?! I really thought so until my boyfriend admitted that he had never been. Challenge accepted. 

Now, I've been a frequent Pei Wei customer ever since I discovered Asian food did not always have to send to you running to the restroom. (Yeah, thanks for nothing Bing Heng and Great Wall Buffet). This isn't the best Asian food ever, but it is quick, accessible, and always pretty tasty. 

I've tried everything on the menu, but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. I ordered these plus the Spicy Korean for my n00b boyfriend to try, and everything went better than expected. 

In fact, he even commented that the place was \"classier\" than he expected. 

Just a side note: you can order and pay online, so you don't have to wait for the takeout line. You can also choose the specific time you would like to pick up your food."}
{"text":"Fast, healthy food options, great alternative in the area if you're unfamiliar with the \"local\" Chinese restaurants but are familiar with PF Changs. 
Fried rice always great, crab wonton - ok, and Kung pao good."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say they really shouldn't advertise a gluten free menu. When I asked for their gluten free menu, I was handed a card about the size of an index card with about 4-5 items on it. I decided on their chopped chicken salad aftrr not seeing anything else appealing out of the small amount of choices. When the salad came out the greens were wilted, there may have been 1/3 cup of chicken on top and it just looked sad. I asked for a refund and left. I won't be returning. If thats all you're offering for gluten free, just skip it and definitely don't serve sad looking food like that. It looked like something McDonald's would put out."}
{"text":"Came in looking for something quick but tasteful. Was on a quick lunch date with my girlfriend Jessica A. and Asian was what our taste buds wanted that day. She ordered the honey seared shrimp while I ordered the Pad Thai noodles. Her's was decent to say the least, when I tried it I expected something a little sweeter but her shrimp was rather on the tangy side.  Not sour, just \"citrusy\" My pad thai was almost on the sour/tangy side when I was expecting something a little spicier and a little sweeter as well. It wasn't bad but it's definitely not the greatest. I'd recommend Pei Wei to anyone that wants a quick taste of Asia but not a place where you go for the full out experience of Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Good location, staff and good food. My experience last visit was less than optimal. Got the orange chicken. Great price- $5. However the portion sizes and dishes were basically unpredictable. I had a regular dish, but it came about 3/4 the size of a small dish. My son had a small but it was  massively portioned. Order size didn't seem to matter. That is a frustrating feeling especially when you spend $45 for your family."}
{"text":"Well de-Elite me, I ate at Pei Wei!  Isn't the 11th commandment \"thou shalt not eat pseudo Asian food at chain restaurants?\"  Forgive me Father Yelp for I have sinned.  That's the extent of my religious knowledge BTW.

So I've only eaten at this location, only take-out, and only sweet and sour chicken, which renders my review pretty useless.  But consistently, it's hot, prepared well, and tasty.  It meets my expectations for what it is.  Do you go into KFC and expect your chicken was actually fried in Kentucky?  Oh wait, most of us don't go to KFC at all.  Too early for a good analogy I guess."}
{"text":"It's PF Changs only cheaper without the class.  No, seriously, same company 90% of the same food.  Still more than you would think to eat here, but since most of us cannot afford the time or money to eat at PF Changs all the time, this is a great option."}
{"text":"I had coupons and got a spicy Korean tofu and gluten free sweet and sour chicken, edamame, and a small fried rice all for $10.26. I just love how Pei Wei offers such great deals and I am always happy with the food and service tops!
Eat Here!"}
{"text":"Customer service is hit or miss at this location... Mostly miss.  The cooks are good though, very consistent.  My favs are crab wontons, Mongolian beef or spicy chicken (extra spicy) and fried rice.  You can't go wrong though."}
{"text":"I got edamame with my pick up order. When I opened it when I got back to work I saw there was hardly any edamame. Maybe 12 pieces for like $3 dollars. And they were hard, like barely even being cooked.

The other food was okay, but I am disappointed that I did not get the amount that I paid for. I wanted something healthy to have with my lunch since my options are limited as a vegetarian."}
{"text":"My brother always raves about Pei Wei and at times even drives out of his way to eat there. So, it pains me to write this review.

I ordered the Thai soup which sounded really good at first especially since I was feeling a little under the weather. The taste was unfortunately pretty bland and the only thing I saw Thai about it was a few basil leaves which also amazingly also had no flavor.....weird.

The entree I went with was the Supergreen Thai Coconut Curry subbing chicken for shrimp. The name of the dish is long in name, but short on flavor and salt yet again. In addition, even though there was a respectable amount of shrimp in the dish none of them were cooked properly (1 of them was mushy *BLECHHH GAG*). I decided to just take the shrimp home to finish cooking them which is sad because I had to pay extra for shrimp.

I did also try the crispy potstickers which were pretty good but overpriced imo (2 for $2.19). The dipping sauce was soy sauce based and at the same time tasted vinegary.

Customer service was decent and the potstickers were tasty so the only reasons I rated 2 stars.

Next time I'll have to ask my brother what he usually eats at PW. Apparently, i made some bad choices my first time round.

Update of review......after I decided to try my leftovers I noticed the tell tale signs of food poisoning bubbling away in my stomach. So disappointing....I really wanted to like one of my brothers favorites. Unfortunately, it won't be one of mine anytime soon....dropping to 1 star."}
{"text":"Expect to spend about $10.00 per person. Nice food. Filling. Great price."}
{"text":"Co-workers and I decided to order take-out from Pei Wei for dinner, last Friday night. This location seemed like it would be the closest to work, but still ended up being quite a drive. With the construction going on near ASU, it took us nearly an hour to get there and back.

When I went to eat my food, was rather amazed to find a staple lying on top of my rice underneath the lid! Also found what appeared to be some facial hair in our chicken lettuce wraps as did my manager in his entree. Aside from all that, the food seemed subpar compared to the many other Pei Wei locations I have visited. 

Tossed the food and didn't even bother to call and complain.
Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"This has to be the DIRTIEST pei wei I've ever seen 
Every empty table was unbused and dirty while the staff stood around chatting"}
{"text":"What a joke. Can i have a dish but just use half the spice as normal.  No we cant!  Ok.  Ordered something else. Bought a beer(warm).  Can i have a chilled glass?  Nope we ran out( i am the only one drinking in the restaurant.  Congrats on making this my last visit!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my nephew. We ordered the spring rolls thinking we ordered the Vietnamese rolls with peanut sauce. When they brought us our order we realized the mistake . We were happy to eat the spring rolls or send them back in exchange for the Vietnamese rolls but Zach was a amazing Guy! He not only had us keep the spring rolls he brought us the Vietnamese rolls as well free of charge! I'm just so grateful and it tickled my heart ! Amazing service! Zach helped my nephew with to go containers and condiments ! I am glad to know Pei Wei has such high standards and am going to make this my new regular location with service like this ! Every restaurant should have a Zach!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed the last time I came here. I ordered a vegetarian dish with fried tofu and had a piece of chicken in the dish.  The cooks need to be a little more aware and make sure nothing remains on the wok before they prepare the next meal. I would like to note to that it is not an issue because there is a dead chicken in my food but because if I eat meat I get a terrible tummy ache.  And no one wants a tummy ache."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place and surprised at how clean and fresh this place is. The rolls are delish and tasty. Watch out for the hot wasabi! Salad was ok. Lettuce was a bit dry and slightly old.  Overall, it's a good pitstop for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone is so put out by Pei Wei, it's a fast yummy take out when you want to watch a movie at home or in a hurry. The cashier was super nice and when she overheard my boyfriend and I debating rice(since he doesnt like the brown) she offered to give us a side of brown on the house! We had the Carmel Chicken which was pretty amazing for a quick Asian place. We've also tried the mandrian Kung Pao and the Thai coconut Curry, both satisfied :) The only complaint is the tofu has a strange taste. 
If you're looking for a nice Asian meal go to P.F. Chang's but this is the same quality food for half the price!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the chicken dishes here, pure white meat.. my favorite. You can eat here relatively healthy and all under $10. The service is pretty decent. I was surprised how slow it was during the lunch hour. Maybe we just weren't here long enough to see a crowd. Location is key for a lot of places and this location is definitely not close to where I live or work, but the co-workers and I were craving some Asian cuisine and this filled our appetites.
I recommend the Orange Peel, Caramel, or Coconut Curry.. yeum"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to rant, but this was the most discussing meal I have ever had. I ordered the honey chkn and noodles and the chkn was still cold inside and the the noodles didn't even have sauce. There tables were filthy, trash cans over flowing and the girl at the register had a sky high attitude! Get a new Job lady, customer service is not for you!! I understand it is an airport.. but I paid $16.00 and threw that meal straight in the trash. (Before doing so) I brought the meal back to trade it in and they said hold on one Sex let me get my boss.. 15 min later.. no one came back. Refund my money.. get new staff and try another business."}
{"text":"I always feel like I am one dinner away from finding something incredible at Pei Wei.  I never feel like I pick the right thing to order.  After all, we stood in a line last night that went out the door.  I thought this might have been free food night but no, it's just a really popular place to eat.  

We sampled the 2 promotional Korean dishes, the Korean BBQ ($8.95)and the Sweet n Sour ($8.95), both served with your choice of either steamed or brown rice.  The food was served fresh and hot but I don't think I would order either again.  Both dishes were swimming in a sugar filled sauce.  Don't get me wrong, I did eat my share of the dishes and did not spit the food out but again, thought I might have ordered the wrong thing. 

The very best part of the dinner was the self serve soda fountain.  Each machine can hold more than 100 soda flavor combinations.  I have been told the new fountain works something like an ink printer with space for flavor cartridges. Each cartridge contains a concentrated formula of ingredients. When you make your selection the fountain mixes your drink making some 100 drink choices possible.  I picked the raspberry Sprite and finally, I think I picked the right thing to order at Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Waited 55 minutes for two salads and one cooked entree. Will never go here again. The only saving grace was the cashier - 17 years old and tried to apologize to the customers when his own manager wouldn't help him out with the dozen or more angry customers. This was hands down the worst experience I've ever had and it looks like this wasn't out of their norm according to other reviewers."}
{"text":"Where to begin...1rst there is not a bigger fan or Pei Wei in the USA as I eat there ( different locations) averaging 4-5 times a week and probably being conservative. However, do to the new management and recent past . Whoa they are NOT paying attention and this location is the worst and lately they have very Long lines and see people leaving ( myself included) when not only long lines...
 Tables are consistently dirty. I see the regional managers over and over at the stores and even then the tables aren't bussed ???? Excluding \"Will\" though he wasn't my favorite person at one time...  I will give him credit, his stores are usually clean, UNLESS Guadalupe and mesa are his?

  Scottsdale 101 I think TJ is a well run clean running machine!

Back to Val Vista- I would just FIRE everyone or just close down for a day or two for some serious past due needed TRAINING ! Teach everyone to buss the flip'n tables ,..\"OFTEN\" and after every customer.

 Don't lose orders!  \" How does that happen? \" Twice in a week! 

 I waited over 25 min until I said something as i saw people after me come and go when I realized they lost my order! ,. They are consistently out of all things lemon in the soda machine! 

Two weeks ago right in the middle of there roll out of New Orange Chicken... YOU DIDN'T HAVE \"ORANGE CHICKEN\" DESPITE ALL YOUR LITERATURE ALL OVER THE PLACE!

 Btw we shall see, but my kids and several of my friends quit going because you got rid of your Orange Chicken a favorite. I go less than before. Although I just get Pei Wei original my second choice!

There still is little training as to the app, EMPLOYEE'S are still asking if I am on the loyalty program?  YIKES,  still asking to take peoples number which is another thing slowing down the line. A complete waste of time. Virtually everyone can download the app if they want and scan there points themselves.

 It works great... Though being able to swipe with the scanner would also be nice ! 

CHALK UP TO A POOR ROLL OUT AND TERRIBLE TRAINING!!! very little customer \"how to guidance\". 

I am sure many other flavors. and of course teach your managers and assistants to OPEN there EYES and see when the lines grow!!

Recap:
 DON'T PRETEND CUSTOMERS ARE NOT THERE!!
 OPEN UP THE REGISTERS AND GET THE LINES DOWN!
 



FINALLY WHEN I HAVE ASKED REPEATEDLY AT NEARLY EVERY PEI WEI TO ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE \"UP\" as it always freezing in there stores...as seen in many reviews all over... They went form blaming it out of there control stating \"temps were controlled by corporate\" to now they say ...\" The truth,\" the cooks want it cooler\" ...
YIKES!!!        You know the sang if you cannot stand the heat!
Make the place comfortable for your customers sitting down! DO NOT worry about the COOKS comfort over customers or it will be irrelevant! 

Assuming , you cannot have both! Making the customer freeze isn't the answer ...:)

When you lose fans like me ( I am still a fan barley hanging on! ) but look out , you might be having problems when you lose people like me! 

Please don't thank me for my review, just fix the issues!! I still love the food most of the time!!!

{"text":"The last two times I've been to this location there were
Problems With The white rice. First time white rice
Wasn't completely cooked. This time they were out of white rice at 12:30pm. So, I had the brown, and it was crunchy! What's up with the rice issues?"}
{"text":"One word...nasty.

The Japanese steak dish tasted rotten. I could not believe what I was eating. The ginger broccoli was ok and the service was good but I will not be eating at this chain again."}
{"text":"Asian food so fresh you can hear it meow.  The soy beans are pretty good as well. They have non-Midwestern cashew kitty that is not bad too."}
{"text":"Plastic forks instead of real ones at 11:15 am when it's not busy. Seriously? They sold out from P.F. Chang's and now the wonderful sauce they used on the ginger broccoli is this yucky stuff. Had it a few times to see if I just had a 'bad batch' or what. But it's just nasty. I wrote to ask them why they hadn't updated my points yet tho I showed the guy my info at the register. 

No one cares. Not going back that's for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with pei Wei! Great location for dining in or sitting on the patio when az weather permits. Right now they have a special menu, I tried the Thai chicken lettuce wraps and they are amazing! I hope they add this as a permanent item to their menu. They also have 2 saved convenient parking spots in case you are doing pick up you can be in and out quickly"}
{"text":"This is fast food but healthier than the norm.
Stick with the meat dishes. The pad thai was disappointing and the sushi was equal to what you get at a grocery store.
The green beans are a staple of my orders. I come here when I'm too busy to cook and too lazy to drive down to a real Chinese restaurant to pick up an order to go."}
{"text":"Ryan is an excellent store manager. Friendly, attentive and devastatingly good looking. I have always loved Pei Wei, but this location makes me love it much more. I now have the ability to enjoy delicious Asian cuisine and, if I'm lucky, the pleasure of being served by Ryan. Service is always timely and the food is always perfect. I would recommend this Pei Wei any day over competing restaurants."}
{"text":"The food tastes delicious at this place except the food is a little oily
However, the food on the whole is tasty and the ambience is excellent"}
{"text":"Was looking for Won Ton Soup, specifically, and came upon this place. I am honestly leary of most Chinese places on Spring Mountain here as I watch 'Dirty Dining' on the news and a lot of repeat offenders end up there...Nevertheless, I will say I was pleasantly surprised w/Pei Wei.  They are seemingly healthy with how they cook their food (soy bean oil) and in the taste (ginger in the spring rolls...a PLUS), I noticed it's pretty 'clean'. No heavy oils or starch, for example...and a lot less salt than Miso, for example. For fairly cheap prices and more natural flavor, you really can't go wrong.  Ps:Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I went in early one day for lunch with my kids. Almost empty. The place has plenty of windows so the light that comes in shows everything! The place is pretty dirty. There was at least 8 people working and all it would take is for one of them to come out and wipe down the tables. It would take less than 10 mins. Good food and I've been to at least 3 locations but this Scottsdale one is the only one I've noticed being in such poor shape."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. It's the fast food version of of Chang. I've been here several times and I find that you get more food when you eat in instead of take out. You seem to get less food on take out. I feel they five more rice than they do for the entrees. I like this place but don't come here too often because of the high sodium content. I love the Mongolian beef and the chicken dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant produces pretty good food but they don't give you what you paid for in any way. I paid two extra dollars for extra chicken and I got less than someone who got single serving. When I asked they refused to give more food."}
{"text":"Great food! I love the updated menu as well. Good diverse Asian cuisine. Good ambiance too"}
{"text":"I enjoy pei wei.  It has really good food, and it is nicer than fast food, but it is below a restaurant.  I am not sure if you can use it for dates, but I do enjoy the vibe.  All kinds of people come here which is always nice for people watchers.  The scenery is always clean.  Prices are not cheap but not expensive either.  You are paying restaurant prices without the tip.  So I guess it saves you 20%.  I do think it's a good place to go if you are meeting a for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Cool spot located near my hotel. I knew I was going to be stuck with American food for a couple days so I needed my rice fix.

Clean, bright, and beautifully decorated. It has a very modern and city-like feel.

Order your meat, choose rice or noodles, take a seat, and wait for your order to come. I ordered the Mongolian beef dish with edamame on the side. The beef slices were good but the sauce was a little too sweet for me. I was hoping something with heat. The cool thing with the edamame was that the salt was on the side so you get to keep this healthy option healthy. 

A good choice for something cheap, fairly quick, and decent."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, and quick food. I was really craving some soup (a cold in May, really???) and stopped by Pei Wei to satisfy that craving. The lady who took my order was really nice and the guy that delivered my food to the table was quick and attentive. Very pleased."}
{"text":"Well all know Pei Wei but it's ridiculous to look around and see people behind you in line eating their food as you continue to wait 30 mins and counting!!! I won't ever be coming back to this franchise !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed on my first visit at this location. It must of been an hour or so after the lunch hour rush and the dining area was dirty with plates left over, the floor was sticky, and the outdoor eating area wasn't that great either. When I was served, the food was just ok."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location of Pei Wei, something goes wrong. When we carry out lettuce is often forgotten for lettuce wraps or items are just completely left out in general. When I dine in, I am appalled by how dirty everything is from the tables to the floor to the soda machine. Once when I was here, there were zero utensils to use, and upon asking an employee for some, she went back to \"check\" and took 30 minutes to bring us some. I would not suggest this location."}
{"text":"In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. 

We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. 

With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?"}
{"text":"It's funny - my husband and I come here every so often and on our most recent visit I decided to check in on yelp and I noticed the horrible reviews.  I found them rather shocking because we've never had a bad experience at this location.  Our food has always been hot and fresh and delicious.  I did notice on this trip they had changed some of their menu items and removed the potstickers, which were our favorite appetizer, so that was disappointing.  We tried the egg rolls and they were good.  I usually get the sweet and sour chicken and have always found it to be really delicious.  My husband gets the dan dan noodles frequently and loves them.  This time he tried a new chicken dish and enjoyed that also.  I guess others have different experiences than we have had but we've been here pretty much once a month for the last year or so and have never had anything negative to say.  We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with anything at Pei Wei. I stop in here at least once a week to grab lunch and it's always been fresh, hot and quick. I love that they now have a smaller size portion of your favorite dish or the regular size. Even the small portion is a good size and I still usually have leftovers.

Definitely one of my favorites to head to for a good lunchtime meal."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I pick up an order at this location that isn't messed up. The staff is almost rude about it when I have to come back and tell them that my order is incorrect."}
{"text":"This location is in my 'hood so I'm always ordering take out on weekends. This place is packed the majority of the time but it's always worth the wait. My faves off the menu have to be the crispy pot stickers and the lettuce wraps I can make a meal off of those alone. The food is pretty consistent and extra points for having brown rice and being able to request that my chicken be steamed instead of breaded and fried. Though the wait time for take out orders can be a little long especially when I decided to order on New Years day, one of the employees gave everyone that was waiting to pick up their order a cup for a free drink! Though a little gesture that went a long way in my book!

I will be back soon, Pei Wei maybe next time I'll even dine in for a change :-)"}
{"text":"The quality of the food and service at this Pei Wei location has gone down hill.  We normally pick up but sometimes eat in the restaurant.  I picked up for our guests the other night Hot & Sour Soup and Vietnamese Rolls.  We couldn't eat the soup.  The soup was so watered down and so tasteless that it wasn't even edible.  I other they cut back on the ingredients or someone doesn't know how to make the soup.  The Vietnamese rolls were skimpy and the wrap itself was old tasting and even hard in areas.  The order is never correct when I pick it up.  I have to check it and asked for what I paid for.  I will not be ordering from Pei Wei's anymore."}
{"text":"This place is too Americanized!  Their food doesn't even come close to real Asian food.  It is a good place for people who want to say they are adventurous, but really like to eat hamburgers & hot dogs.  Over priced!"}
{"text":"One Liner: I wish we have one of those by my office

Food: (scale of 0-4) 3.1
I was down in Charlotte working my ____ off during the weekend. I found this interesting looking fast food place (apparently fast food by PF Chang's?) I decided to try it. I ended up having it 3 times in as many days. The menu is very ordinary. However, the food was totally unexpected. The pad thai was really good. It's nothing like the authentic thai dish, but the creation provided a great alternative taste. I added about 3 spoon full of the vietnamese chili sauce. The combination well deserved my stomach space. All that for 8 bucks. The drink was complimentary if you get the food to go!

Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.8

Service 0.2: This appears to be a well manages chain. The service was good. The food got to me fast. I can't complain.
 
Decor 0.2: It might be billed as \"fast food\", the restaurant is actually well appointed. It's a good experience even for eat in.

Speed 0.2: 

Dessert 0: 

Prices 0.2: Check out their web site.....most common dished are 7 or 8 bucks. The specialties are just a bit more.

My score for this experience is 3.9 stars.
I'm bumping it up to 4. A week after my last experience, I'm still drooling just thinking about the pad thai."}
{"text":"This is an OK place.  I have other places I'd rather go, but when the wife wants Pei Wei, she usually gets it.

I like the fact that they have brown rice.  The Asian Chopped Chicken Salad and Ginger Brocolli Chicken taste good and aren't too bad in terms of nutritional value.

We've dined in here before, but we usually do the take out. I like that they have their own take out ordering line and waiting area.  They're usually friendly which is a plus since they always seem insanely busy.  The only area of complaint is that they seem to close their kitchen early sometimes.  This makes for a very disappointing meal run."}
{"text":"This is a go to pick up place when I want some Asian fusion. I haven't had any complaints. I know the food is fresh and know what to expect when I order. There's some comfort in the standard of food expected at chains which I can appreciate. Some favourites are the honey seared chicken, lettuce wraps, and ginger chicken. My hubs loves the beef and chicken ramen but I think it has an ungodly smell. I don't know how he eats it. 
The kid meals are a good size and we always order the noodles which he scarfs down. 

If you sign up for their rewards program, they offer great specials like but one get one, free appetizer with your order, or a percentage off."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Pei Wei. It is owned by the same ppl who own P.F.Changs- just not as pricey. I got a honey chicken dish and white rice. It was great! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I didn't like it so neither will you. Crazy expensive for starters, and small portions make this a place to drive right on by. Total waste of my time and rescources. My egg fu yong had no gravy to smother it with and tasted funky anyhow. Wife had sweet and sour chicken which she said was good, but she'd eat a bucket of sh_t if it had a bow on it so that doesn't count. Seriously find a mexican chef and you'll experience some real Chinese food. Like in SoCal.  I know that sounds crazy but it's Gospel."}
{"text":"I've had good experiences at this location in the past, but tonight was not so good. The place was busy-as it should be during dinner, but the take out department was overwhelmed! My order was not correct, yet I could not get through via phone to discuss the matter and it was mediocre in flavor/taste!"}
{"text":"I love pei wei! I come to this location all the time. Services is great and the food is always delicious. You can say it's fast food but it's not. 
Lots of different salads, Pad Thai and poke bowl."}
{"text":"I would have given more stars but the staff ruined that!  
They didn't have any forks we told 2 different people and then got from someone else they were washing some.  It's 2:00 in the afternoon on a Wednesday.  They also seemed to be out of a lot of soft drink choices.  In a positive note the food is very good, next time I will get it to go."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a first timer to Pei Wei. A very busy Friday night. The staff was hopping taking orders, serving and busy cooking. As I sat and waited for my order I watched flames fly and smelling the sizzling, garlic, onions and chilis. All did smell yummy. My meal was good, but I was not exceptionally impressed. I was impressed by the young man who took my order and helped me. I told him this was my first time to the restaurant, if he had any suggestions? He offered great choices, but I made the choice. I will the restaurant another chance so I can try something else. I had the Pei Wei Spicy Sauce with noodles and steak. The beef was tender, but the sauce and noodles weren't as tasty as I hoped. I also ordered the Crab Wontons, now I did like those, they were very good. I thank the young man who took my order (cashier 1, sorry I didn't get his name), thank you."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. The potions were tiny!!! I got the sesame chicken and it was barely enough to feed 1. I also got lettuce wraps and they barely give any meat!!

The lettuce was wilted, very upset and all this for $16. I will never be going back to a pei Wei. 1 star is probably too much, I wish they had half a star."}
{"text":"A very nice lady greeted us at the big t.v thing with the menu and was full of helpful information and it was very nice due to the fact of me and my wife haven't really been their also the food was amazing. We definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"order to go and I got two hairs on my bag....and the cookers were very rude fighting between each other cursing in Spanish....as Hispanics we have class ....and respect people who sorounds us...i am very disappointed with the wrk ethics....there should be a wall in order for the clients not to hear the bad vocubalary of the cookers..bad management"}
{"text":"First off I would like to say that the overall layout of the restaurant is appealing, very cleanly, seating arrangement isn't too close together and depending on the weather the patio is always nice. The staff at this location is always very helpful and friendly, ordering online for this location is always awesome because your food is waiting for you when you get there. I know it's a minute detail but the front desk set up was a nice touch as well, makes it fairly easy and efficient to get people seated or on their way with a takeout order.

If I had to suggest anything as far as food goes, Thai Dynamite Steak Wok, Steam it, Extra Spicy and Extra Vegetables. Couple with an order of the Chicken Salad rolls or Crab Wantons always work! Don't be afraid to grab a handful of fortune cookies, the staff here won't judge you, they just turn a blind eye to your addiction.. ;D"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a fast, easy, cheaper PF Chang's - and that's what makes it great! If you like the tofu dishes at PF Chang's, you'll love Pei Wei. The food here is great. The service is exceptional. And the portions are huge! I usually end up taking about half the food home with me. Also, compared to other lunch spots near by (like Paradise Bakery), it's really not all that busy. Of course, it's not authentic Asian food, but you shouldn't be expecting that when you come here anyway."}
{"text":"First let me say I always hope food and service will be good but always it's not up to standard. Tonight we ordered a few different items, lettuce wraps were missing from takeout order but lettuce was there. The chicken we ordered had just a little bit of chicken not like normal mostly peppers. Honestly Pei Wei food has gone down hill. It's not worth the price. Have to say I won't go back. Think they have cut back too much and quality suffers."}
{"text":"I actually expected more better from Pei Wei. I LOVE it. The food I got was just terrible. I took a bite and I swear to God I tasted cigarette. Absolutely discusting. I'll still give them another chance, but this was unexpected for me. Please don't disappoint anyone else."}
{"text":"I always seem to enjoy Pei Wei,  but never enough to want to go back right away.  I'm not exactly sure what it is as the food is decent enough.  It might be the big fat pea pods they use.  I prefer the flatter & sweeter snow pea to what they use.  If you haven't tried it give it a shot, most people seem to really like it."}
{"text":"I do mostly take out - and eat in rarely but I do 2-3 times a year and noticed...
Totally hit or miss here when you do take out.  It seems that you get less food when you do take out - I have noticed you definitely get less veggies and less meat.

Never order 'extra' of anything - you have less than a 50% chance you will actually get anything worth the $1 or $2 you are paying.  I order extra veggies and get like 2 or 3 broccoli pieces. 

I only get food here when there is a Bogo, that is the only time it is worth take out."}
{"text":"Oh man did they frustrate me. I ordered lunch online for me and my daughter. I headed there with plenty of time to get back to work until about after 10 minutes of waiting they tell me they are out of white rice and it will be 20 minutes before they have more. Who the heck runs out of rice when that is the staple to almost everything you make. I was BEYOND frustrated. I asked for a manager who never came out. I will not be ordering online for lunch again."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Same owners as pf changs but w half the cost! Everything was to die for! Even their soda machine was awesome,, it's had over 80 options! Great yesterday and great prices. Great for lunch or quick dinner."}
{"text":"We eat at Pei Wei often because we really like their food. Today the service was very poor. Just to order was almost 20 minutes. With a line out the door there was one register open. the wait for our food was way too long and they had no soup spoons so we ate our soup with something the size of a ladle. We didn't get plates we had to go pick them up ourselves one of which was dirty look like it hadn't been washed. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a Pei Wei restaurant."}
{"text":"Love it, I got the curry chicken. Could have used more curry but was still good. Also got some crab wontons which were sooooo good.  My manager got the fried rice which she really enjoyed also."}
{"text":"P.F. Changs but fast-casual. The orange chicken is a stand by that we enjoy, we like to sub out the white rice for the fried rice. The wonton soup is great. Love the lettuce wraps.

This location can get very, very busy. The take out counter can get slammed and you have to help them find your order :) sometimes the pickup time can be an hour after your order on busy weekend nights so plan ahead.

Dana Park's parking can also get very busy, Pei Wei has a nice amount of reserved parking for take out orders which is very convenient."}
{"text":"I had a craving for noodle today so I stopped by the Pei Wei. The hubs got the $5 orange chicken bowl and I got a side of noodles for $1.50. We received great service. The total bill was $7.02 for dinner and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Well I have always been a fan of Pei Wei chains... Except this location made me uneasy! My guest and I literally waited 29 minutes to receive out meals. The most annoying feeling in the world is waiting for your food when you're starving, while seeing other individuals who arrived/ ordered after you enjoy their meal first! When i complained to the staff asking them if they had lost my order. All they wanted to do was argue with me about how long I have been waiting! Guess they forgot to realize the receipt has the time of order on it! 29 MINUTES and 8 MINUTES is a big gap!! Ugh!!! I don't know about you but I am not a fan of eating while I am unhappy. I will NEVER come to this Pei Wei again!! I'll make sure at least 7 other people know about my experience here as well!"}
{"text":"I sent an email to your \"contract us\" option through the website last week. I haven't heard anything yet."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for an early dinner on Sunday. Very disappointed. Service slow, its a shame hospitality is an unknown term and when we finally did get our food it was wrong. Granted the to go area was busy. Seems to me they need more staff or better kitchen workers. My wife about broke a tooth on a chicken bone in the Pad Thai. We will stick with Jade Palace and others for Asian cuisine in the Greyhawk area.  Visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"If I wanted overly-breaded orange chicken I'd go to Panda Express. Why did you guys change your recipe? Your orange chicken tastes like nothing but fried batter now. And, your shrimp is now salad size. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am a Pei Wei diner. I eat at many Pei Wei locations. I tried to sit at five tables before I found one that was not super sticky and gross. The volume of music is a bit too loud compared to other locations, but Pei Wei is noisy anyway so that's not a huge deal. I always get vietnamese chicken salad rolls, and the quality of the roll varies a lot.  The sushi rills I had had way too much sauce. I do not recommend getting sushi here."}
{"text":"Overcooked syrupy sweet chinese food tastes un fresh like it was plated from a cut rate buffet."}
{"text":"I like that Pei Wei will let me get a kids' meal, even though I'm not a kid. 

Truthfully, I need the help with portion control when it comes to rice and sauces and allowing me the kids' meal option makes this one of the first places I think of when I'm looking to satisfy a rice craving -- and, it's definitely the only \"guilt-free\" place that comes to mind. 

The parking lot here STINKS!! Otherwise, I'd totally give you one more star."}
{"text":"Pei-Wei is one of my favorite meals, the place is always clean. The crab puffs come out fast and the tea is delicious! 

Come here on lunch, dinner or with friends. A great place for some Asian food with great friends. 

Grab a Starbucks next door to wash down your dinner!"}
{"text":"180 turn around for this location. After being shut down for illegal labor then changing owners, menu's; and almost closing. This Pei Wei is back to stay! The menu is back in full force, the employees are vibrant, the atmosphere is palatable and the tea is to die for. 

Eat here as often as you can!!!"}
{"text":"Although you don't know me, take my advice and do not order the Korean spicy chicken with quinoa from this location.  It's a disaster, like that raging apartment fire across the street.  Soupy mess ... Needs 2x more quinoa and less sauce.  The chicken wasnt vey clean either ... A major turn off."}
{"text":"I love pei Wei always ! Dan Dan noodles extra spicy is delicious and the ginger broccoli are my faves !"}
{"text":"Always a favorite place to go that's casual and yummy ! Had their carmel chicken and it was so good ! All of the staff is very nice and this place is always super clean and tidy !"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience this evening.  Let me start by saying that I really like Pei Wei but tonight, this location was unlike any experience we've had.  The guy taking our order had the personality of a shoe and it appeared that he was annoyed by pesky patrons.  It was busy and there were at least 8-9 tables that had not been cleared or bussed with people standing around waiting for a place to sit. When I asked someone about bussing the table he made his way over to our table, cleared it and was gone leaving several.other couples and families standing around. Then to top it all off, my order never came.  Again inquired and they politely apologized, assuring me it would be there soon.  Shortly after I watched my wife and kids finish their meal, I inquired about my order again.  Needless to say, the manager and I were both surprised by this.  I ended up with a steaming hot plate and three faces watching me eat as I heard the chatter around the restaurant about the service, etc.  

To be fair, the manager comped our meal - a very nice thing to do and much appreciated.  That said, after countless Pei Wei expeditions, the entire experience tonight was unfortunate.  I know, I know - first world problems, right?  I don't care - I believe in great service and that going out to eat is a luxury for most so when the experience is awful it requires a mention so that it may be prevented next time."}
{"text":"Parking sucks and birds are fearless if you eat outside. Other than that, its your average pei wei"}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup, set the time, got there a minute early. Boom, food was ready. Drove home, food was all there and hot! I can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Tasty and fast, if you get there at 11am. I'm liking the combo lunch specials."}
{"text":"I found the service to be severely lacking but really enjoyed the food. It's true when people say this is a \"second rate PF Chang's\" because they are owned by the same company but the food is good at a lower price. 

You order your food and then receive a number to take to your table for your food to be brought to you. I was with a group of about six or seven and our \"waitress\" was either incredibly new or incredibly uninterested in learning the menu. She consistently brought each person the wrong meal they ordered. And then when she would bring the food out, she wasn't sure which meal was which. She couldn't tell the difference between a meal with chicken or tofu. It got to the point where the service was so comically bad, we thought it was all an elaborate joke. 

I would go back for take out orders but wouldn't want to deal with a similar hassle of dining-in like I experienced."}
{"text":"Great service, staff is polite and helpful. The food is okay for the money, not amazing, but okay. If you have the time and are close to PF Changs (owned by the same company), I suggest going to PF Changs, feel's like the food, seasons, value, and variety is better than Pei Wei."}
{"text":"For Asian Fusion, which I don't necessarily agree with, this was an excellent place to eat.  Nice selection, nice prices, quick service.  It's an offshoot Of PF Chang's, kind of like their fast food brand, actually prefer it to the owners'."}
{"text":"YUM!!! Cafeteria style setting. Order sit or to go. Try the raw fish. Great spice. I love the atmosphere  here. Casual no frills but , the food is quality. Great for a quick lunch always fresh. If you love Asian flair at a reasonable price. This is it."}
{"text":"Same great food. Not as clean as Eastern location. Not wheelchair friendly. Crowded at 11:00, probably cause the food is deelish!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment, food drowned in sodium!!! Soup, chicken dish, noodles... all tasted like it was sauté in salt oil."}
{"text":"This was my first Pei Wei experience, and was a spontaneous choice. The location was clean but the tables did not have plates or napkins. This is cafeteria-style dining with above cafeteria quality food (ie: Panda Express). The food was good and fast, but look at the menu before going to this location. I would go back to try the noodles (they looked good). Not a destination dining choice in my opinion, but good none the less."}
{"text":"I gave them a second chance after a bad one the first time I visited here. They are extremely slow and move like turtles. They have no parking and it's very congested. My beef was completely dried out! I was like eating beef jerky."}
{"text":"Third time at this location.  Only one time was good, and that was when we actually ate there. 
 No problems then.  But the other two times, my co-worker and I picked-up our lunch.  Today, the Ice Tea was empty - so my co-worker asked the lady (who seemed to be the Supervisor today) if there was anymore tea.  The lady said she'd fill it up, but first, she just HAD TO fill-up her own large soda.  I then noticed that BOTH machines were out of Coke, so I mentioned to her, as well.  She only replied, \"Then they're both out\".  That was it.  I then told my co-worker I was going to get a refund (Dr Pepper was also out) on my drink - this woman heard me.  So, I go to pick-up my To Go order, but no one is there to help ALL the people standing around waiting for their orders, as well.  So, I go to the main cashier guy and tell him I want a refund because there is no more Coke.  During this time, the same woman is now standing in the Pick Up area and talking to two women while a man is MAD about his order not being complete (after getting home with it).  Another woman is arguing with the man.  Both women finally agree to refund the guy's order.  FINALLY, the cashier guy helping me is now back with one of the women.  Apparently he can't do refunds.  Then, she can't do a refund either.  All this time, the Supervisor woman is still standing over there talking to the same two women - KNOWING I wanted to get a refund.  She finally comes over and refunds my two bucks, 10 minutes later.  And then tries to give me a NEW RECEIPT.  For what?  LoL.  
So, my co-worker and I return to work with our takeout orders...  Her rice is not even cooked enough, STILL CRUNCHY!  The veggies in BOTH our dishes weren't cooked, as well.  And my noodles are DRY - thank goodness for the SOY SAUCE.  
Guess I should've taken that new receipt!  LoL.  
This place could be soooo much better.  
We won't be going here for lunch again."}
{"text":"I get takeout from here five to ten+ times a month. I like Pei Wei's menu, and I've been eating some of these items for a decade. We can do the math on the amount of business a long term customer like myself has given. I've had extreme loyalty. Had. 

Now, here's the continuous issue with this particular location... items are frequently missing from our bag. I'm talking 75% of the time. 
I have a large family, so we are talking orders in the amount of over $40. 
Tonight, we asked if an item was in the bag upon pickup. Yes, said the cashier. 
We get home, unpack the bag, and nope! 

Now, this isn't the end of the world, it's just food, yes. However, you may lose lifetime customers like myself after today, because ordering takeout from Pei Wei has just become too much trouble and just too unreliable. 

I would suggest doing what some other concepts do- unpack the bag and show the guest every item upon pickup. You might just keep loyal guests, like myself. Might."}
{"text":"So, I've heard a lot of good things about this place and since I've lived near Dana Park for the past few years, I decided to try it. My food was good. It wasn't worth what I paid for it, but it was good. It was my first time and I was expecting a sit-down place from all the hype and I wasn't sure how to order. I explained that it was my first time to the woman behind the counter and she was a rude idiot. I was not pleased with the customer service at all. A woman was hovering over me so she could take my plate when I wasn't even done eating. I will probably not be back. I can go to Panda Express and have mediocre and overpriced Chinese food without a terrible dining experience."}
{"text":"Food is served nice and hot. Love the Mongolian crispy chicken. Menu is a little limited vs. PF Chang's full menu. Alcohol selection is very limited."}
{"text":"Well, reasonably good taste and veryconvient. But they always mass up if you have some special requirement for the chicken change to beef, or forget what actually you order. Also, some veggies like lettuce not fresh sometimes like this picture. 

The receive never shows the price for every single item."}
{"text":"This place can never get an online or over the phone order right! I don't know if its because they can't read or they don't care!"}
{"text":"Consistently good Chinese with a fair price and fast service.

I personally love the Spicy Korean sauce and if you are a Tofu lover, they sauté it great on the wok.

I recommend the spring rolls and vegetable wraps as well.

Great for a quick fix of PF Chang's style Chinese."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei! It seems to be the restaurant of choice every time I want to dine somewhere with a good atmosphere and good prices. The food is really good too! What I like about Pei Wei's food is how they make it their own and do it well. I've been eating at Pei Wei for about eight years and still enjoy their establishment."}
{"text":"Do not use their new online service!!!   What a mess.  It became obvious that unless you ordered your food to go or ate in, the online orders went to the bottom of the pile and were left in the ozone.  I counted at least 25 people who came in after me but got their food  and left.  I placed my online order at 6:05 pm and finally got it at 7:23.  By then the crab puffs were cold and the dinners were semi-warm.   Come on PW.   You should do better than this.   This Summit location also appears to be short staffed all the time.   I realize they were closed for a time last year by the INS, but get over it and get better organized.  This is unacceptable and very disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at this Pei Wei about once a week since it opened. It was our favorite restaurant in the area.  Unfortunately, they haven't been maintaining their restaurant. The booths are worn out. The soda machine malfunctioned during our last visit and shot soda all over the guests. The dining area is dirty. The food is still good. However, it makes me wonder if the food is safe. If they're neglecting their dining area are they also neglecting their kitchen? On a recent visit we advised an employee that the tea didn't seem very strong, hoping he would check it out. Instead he was rude and advised us that the tea is the same as always. Excuse me but I've had their tea every week for the past few years and I know when it's not correct. I would recommend that they hire a manager that actually cares so he could make some repairs, do some maintenance, clean the restaurant, and retrain the staff. Pei Wei should be ashamed of how they've let this restaurant slip. I've written emails to their corporate office. Now we'll see if they do something to bring this store back to the excellent restaurant that it was."}
{"text":"I love sitting at the counter with my Kids looking at the food being cooked and watching them lost in amazement at all that is going on.
Food is served fast, hot with great presentation, love the coke machine, seems to have 1000 combinations of flavors."}
{"text":"You know, I have nothing against this location but more of an issue with the food of the place in general.
Is it always so bland?  It's never that flavorful to me and I've been there like 12 times with different people and have tried different things.  My roomate loves it but I'm just not a big fan honestly.

The location is clean and staff friendly and bustling but I just don't like the food."}
{"text":"Aside from the moody girls that work there, the food at this location just didn't hit the spot. I guess the customer service took away my hunger. Oh well, I guess they don't know that it's better to shake that booty than to be moody."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Service on the other hand was hideous. I did my check in to get a free hummus, showed the code to the cashier and closed the app. After I did so she decides to tell me she still needed the code, why wouldn't you tell someone before giving the phone back. So then I thought I lost the code (but luckily I didn't). At the end of the meal I asked for a container for my hummus and let her know that the black tea was out. She didn't say a word just looked at me with disgust, shaking her head, and walked over to her coworker and complained. Any who....delicious food, but employees who seem to despise their jobs. Sad for them!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad because my boyfriend let me pick the restaurant for dinner and it was awful. The facility was disgusting. Trash, food, sticky counters and tables. Food was so so."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place is even in business. We live in the surrounding neighborhood and for the last six months or longer, regardless of the time of day or day of week my family and I go in, upon walking up to place our order, we are informed there is a 45 minute to one hour wait! Literally, that is how they greet their customers. They don't say \"hello\", they don't say \"welcome\", they say \"we just want to let you know before you place your order that it's a minimum 45 minute to one hour wait\". Every.Single.Time. This evening I was walked in to place an order for myself and verified that one order of Pad Thai  would take one hour and was told \"yes\". Upon asking for the GM's card (honestly, at this point I don't think it's fair to the investors of this company. They need to know what is going on) the man at the counter turned around and yelled to a woman working 'on the line' who then yelled back that she didn't have any cards. I asked if he would write down her information but he either didn't know her information or refused to do so. Either way, I left without anyone to contact. I picked up something from their neighbor, Chipotle, which took less than 10 minutes. 

By the way, it's no better if you try to call in advance or order online, which we have done with minimal success in the past. Half the time the website is down or no one answers the phone. This place is an absolute disaster. Attention Pei Wei investors-if you are reading this- you need to make a change. You are sitting on a gold mine in a neighborhood where the demographic can afford to go out to eat every night if they choose to.

And Alexis, I've been reading through the other posts and noticed your responses to all are unauthentic. Please don't waste your time cutting and pasting the response template to my post. It just further demonstrates the lack of interest and respect Pei Wei has for its patrons (former patrons)."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Sunday when they 1st opened at 11am. I love Pei Wei and crave their Orange Peel Chicken and lettuce wraps, my 2 favorite dishes.

Restaurant was clean, they just opened for the day.

Decided to try the fried rice for the 1st time as I normally get brown rice.  It was horrible, so greasy and completely took any flavor away from the Orange Peel Chicken. Ewwww!!

Nothing to write about service or anything else as no one came around and gal taking order made the order quick and simple process. Nothing great about this location.  So disappointing for $10 and I left half the plate of food."}
{"text":"Was here a couple weeks ago with the kids and had a great meal and experience.  So good that as I was running errands today,  I was hungry for it.  

So disappointed today.  I order what I normally do, the orange peel chicken and for $8.69 I got a huge scoop of rice that towered over the 10 or so little chicken nuggets looking pieces and it was so dry tasting. I asked the server if I had a side portion and he so no. He could see the disappointed look on my face and agreed to bring me more.  I appreciated that.  But even with that,  I thought for a lunch portion it was quite expensive.  

Booo"}
{"text":"Thai dynamite, with a name like that I expected something with a little kick. All I got was an overwhelming lime flavored soggy mess.

I've tried several different noodle bowls as well and nothing has been tasty enough to warrant a second try. 

Pei Wei = No wei."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is the fast food version of P.F. Changs. When I say 'fast food', I don't mean there is a drive thru, the food is pre-made, and deep fried. 

P.F. Changs took a bunch of their more popular dishes and created a more casual atmosphere for the 'on the go' person or family. 

How it goes:

Walk in
Check out the menu
Order at the counter
Take a number
Grab a seat
Food will be served at your table 

The food is just as great, the service different because it requires more work on your part, and the meals could be a few bucks cheaper. Other than the cost, I would have given Pei Wei 4 stars."}
{"text":"I understand that places need time to clean up but locking doors over 20 minutes early for carry out basically loses business forever."}
{"text":"The best Pei Wei in town. 
This location is the cleanest and with a great, friendly staff. 
A favorite spot. 

Side note: 
For those who are unfamiliar with Pei Wei - I like to describe it as a blend between PF Chang's and Starbucks atmosphere. 
A corner store version of PF Chang's. Very similar menu. 
Definitely worth trying if you have never been."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review to 5 stars. I really love this location. Super friendly, knowledgeable staff. Every time I order takeout they are great. The spicy chicken salad is my favorite. I'm also very partial to the orange iced tea. One of my favorites in town. I also really love that they have all the allergen info on line and you can order online - makes things so much easier. Life/lazy hack. When I need rice for a dinner that I'm making - I almost always order it from here. Super cheap and very easy. You are welcome."}
{"text":"I can see why this restaurant has such a low rating of two and a half stars.  I'm giving it one star.  I'm talking about this particular location that continuously has messed up my order.  They either don't care what, or how an order comes out of the kitchen for take out.  I feel like they take advantage of the fact that chances are slim you're going to bring back an order once you're home.  I was so hungry, I just decided to eat what I had even though it's no where near what I expected, or am used to.    I feel like either the cooks are new, or extremely incompetent!!  Tonight I ordered the Pei Wei spicy chicken with fried rice.  I've been ordering this dish for over a decade at other locations, as it's my favorite Pei Wei dish.  The chicken did not have the usual fried coating, or the sweet spicy sauce.  It's like I got an order of fried rice with chicken.  That's it.  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. We generally order the same thing every time. 
.spicy chicken brown rice
.chicken fried rice
.honey seared chicken for the kids
Today we did sweet and sour chicken instead of honey seared.

The staff is generally very nice, quick, and good customer service. 

Don't come here looking to replace your favorite type of food.
Don't come here looking to replace your favorite authentic Chinese food.
Don't come here looking for a real restaurant experience.

Do come here for fresh American versions of Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been to many different Pei Wei's.  This was by far the worst Pei Wei experience ever.  Had to wait 30 minutes for food even though the place didn't look busy.  Rice was cold and clumped together.  Trash all over the floor.  Drink machine was missing the tray to sit the cup on.  Had plastic forks only.  What a mess."}
{"text":"We used to love this place and went there about twice a week, but recently they changed the menu and not for the better, in our opinion. They no longer have the caramel chicken, and nothing else on the menu is close. When we order \"extra vegetables,\" we used to get a mix of several. On our last couple of visits,  it was just a couple of clumps of broccoli and maybe one or two snow peas. The place also did not seem as clean as it should be in our opinion. Tables were sticky due to having been cleaned improperly or not at all. Servers with long, unkempt hair hanging all over the place, did not add to our confidence. This is disappointing, since we used to really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"This is the last time I order from this Pei Wei. They have messed up my order too many times. Ordered Pad Thai with chicken, looked in my bag and said, \"This isn't my order.\" And the girl said, \"Yes it is, Pad Thai chicken.\" Got home, and it's Pad Thai with vegetables. NO chicken, and no peanuts! Totally flavorless and dry as heck! Should have taken it back but I live 5 miles away."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup is really good has great flavor with the tofu and veggies and the chicken. The mango salsa California roll is also really good very fresh if you want something light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong again. This franchise has always given me great service and food. Not sure why this location can not get my order right. Each time it's different and saturated in sweet sauce. What's hard to remember \"no sauce\". Ugh... Just reimburse me please or, at least, provide the food how I've ordered it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was filthy. There was no ice in either dispenser, there was a hole in the floor in front of dispenser that had the cover displaced and the metal was sticking up, the tea had a funky taste and the Kung Pao Shrimp was only ok. Go to the PeiWei at 101and Raintree. This one needs to have the inspector visit"}
{"text":"The restaurant was filthy. The employees were inattentive and the food was disgusting.  Our orders were brought to the table one setting at a time, with long intervals in between.  The presentation of the food on the plate was lackluster.  The orange chicken had little sauce with a only few pieces of chicken.  It was unattractively put on a overabundance of brown rice in a soup bowl.  The Spicy Korean Chicken was cold, and the chicken was rubbery.
Will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pei Wei. I keep coming back and back. Kung Pao chicken is to die for, one of my favorite foods. Service is what it is, minimal, but what is done is done well. Always very fast, and the place is usually busy."}
{"text":"What a frustrating experience! Ordered my food online because I was in back to back meetings and wasn't going to have time for much of a lunch break. Placed order at 10:45 for pickup at 11:15. Arrived at 11:10 and didn't get my order until 11:30. OK so it's only 15 minutes but when you're in a rush and you planned ahead of time, waiting that extra 15 minutes is not good. The frustrating part was that there was one person behind the counter taking walk in orders, answering the phone, AND preparing to go orders!  I have two stars: one because the girl behind the counter was nice, polite and friendly and another because, as always, the food was great! It's just a bummer that they took so long."}
{"text":"It's not bad bang for your buck. It's a step up from Panda, but maybe not quite as genuine as other sit-down Chinese restaurants. The food is good though. The service is quick. I'm fairly confident I'll go back."}
{"text":"Good food. Slow service at this particular location, at least the day I visited. They were out of a lot of things, including silverware, napkins, and ice, which seemed strange with less than five customers inside. However, the spicy mango plate was on-point though."}
{"text":"Well, it's a Pei Wei. Heh. I won't lie; I do enjoy almost everything I've had at this chain. This location is no different. The service is exceptionally kind here, and their military discount takes more off the bill than at other locations. The ONLY complaint is that while my Pad Tai had plenty of chicken in it, my wife's plate hardly had any at all. Other than that, this is one of our favorite fast-casual chains we frequent."}
{"text":"I know Pei Wei isn't authentic Asian cuisine, so I won't pretend like I go there thinking it is. Regardless, I love the taste, as American-ized chain restaurant as it may be. It's usually pretty fast service, and I like the overall atmosphere of this particular location. I eat the Pad Thai there pretty regularly, and I think it's great that they offer their consumers a rewards program that earn you free entrees after so many visits. More places should do this to show customer appreciation. I'll keep getting lunch here so long as the outstanding service and reasonably priced bowls/plates continue."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Pei Wei's and this one by far offered the worst experience. The taste of the food is on par with the others, though the portion size on the Orange Peel Chicken seemed noticeably smaller (maybe it was because it was to-go???) 

Fast forward to my last visit. I was in the area, just off work, and hungry. I knew they closed in 12 minutes so I called and was going to get my order to go. They didn't pick up. The phone just rang and rang. I continued to drive toward them, saw their OPEN sign still on, and walked up to the register at exactly 7 minutes to close. Then, with a grin, the person (in charge?) says, \"Sorry we're closed.\" I reply that they close at 9, and that I was going to order my food to go, but that's shut down with a \"No, we're closed. They already cleaned the grills.\" I'm offered a cookie, which are free anyway, so that seemed more like an insult than a kind gesture, but I pass and leave in state of disbelief. Seems this particular location might want to reassess who is running the place at night."}
{"text":"We live a lot closer to the Gilbert location but drive out of our way to dine here because the food is much more consistently made and the restaurant itself is much cleaner.  We are regulars and eat here 3 times a month or more.

However our last take out order was totally wrong.  I'm hoping they don't follow suit with their Gilbert neighbors and hope it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"I have to start this review with a disclaimer.  I adore pei wei.  I'm a huge fan and have been for years.  It's our go to take out spot and we order from them often.

However this particular location has really gone down hill.  As we usually order out and rarely eat in I hadn't noticed the decline inside.  Although it's under going renovations the actual upkeep has been greatly neglected.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is horrific.  From the sticky tables, to the poor sweeping, to the grimy door handles, to the hazards in the bathroom.  The women's bathroom has a leaky pipe and water collects below the sink creating a huge tripping hazard.  The soak also drips and there is a large puddle of soap on the floor as well.  My husband and I were horrified when we noticed, walking by what the kitchen looked like.  It had been freshly mopped but not swept.  It was disgusting.  The outdoor seating area was terribly maintained.  The tables were more like see-saws and the ground was filthy.  The silverware wasn't restocked and when we informed the server he told us he would look in to it, when our food came or we mentioned it again and his response was, \"there are forks now.\"  He didn't even offer to bring us one.

The food was an absolute joke.  It was so poorly put together and rushed.  It looked like my 5 year old daughter did the chopping.  

My husband ordered a teriyaki bowl and the amount of white onion in the bowl was shocking.  There was more raw white onion than rice, and maybe 7 pieces of chicken.

The edemame was overlooked and soggy and served with pieces of soggy noodle stuck to the shells.

I ordered caramel beef because I adore the Asian slaw.  My dish not only came out with the wrong protein but it didn't resemble the dish I ordered in the least.  Some large horribly cut pieces of red pepper and carrots were thrown on top of a bed of super dry noodles and chicken.  I found one piece of pineapple.

The manager listened to our concerns and remade our dishes.  She handled the situation well.  My dish was much better made but still lacking in finesse.

There needs to be more attention to detail and cleanliness.  The dishes need to be checked with quality control."}
{"text":"Hey buddy, I was pleasantly surprised with this little joint. 

It was my first time at the rodeo, and the guy behind the counter explained everything on the menu so a little pigeon head like me could totally dig it. 

I chowed down on the Thai Dymamite with steamed chicken instead of fried, cuz momma don't need any more junk in the trunk. It was pretty good, brown rice of course of course. Not nearly spicy enough for sure. The spring roll appy was mighty tasty as well, crunchy and hot in all the right places. 

The style of the place is hard to pinpoint... It's not quite a chipotle, but not a sit down. You order and pay at the counter, they give you a number and then bring your comida to you. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

Definitely, and I mean definitely, check out the ridiculous soda fountain. It will knock your ever living socks off."}
{"text":"Decided to go there last night so I went online to place our to-go order.  Soon discovered that you cannot order certain things online even though they are offered on the menu therefore I just called the restaurant and placed the order, to be picked up at 5:50pm.  The girl that took my order explained that they were still working through the online system and hopefully you will be able to order everything soon.  She read my order back to me and it was correct.  I arrived at 5:50 to pick up our order and the young man read everything back to me again, just as I had ordered it.  He told me that it would take about 5-10 minutes to put my order together.  Ok, I'm assuming they don't prepare the dishes until you arrive so that it will be nice and fresh.  I'm fine with that.
About that same amount of time passed and they showed up with my bag of food.  As I was preparing to walk out the door, a server stopped me to tell me that we were missing our 6 rolls that had been ordered and it would be a few minutes because they have to be made from scratch.  A little confused now since they were in the order and everyone knew it but again, I sat and waited.  In about 5 minutes the young man brought me a tray with 3 rolls and said \"here you go - have a nice evening\".  I looked at him and said where are the other 3, I ordered 6?  A look of confusion came over his face, he went back to the young lady (who I assume was the mgr on duty), told her and she asked someone to make another order.  She came back to me, apologized and asked if there was anything else she could get for us, nope just the rolls was my answer.  This took about another 10 minutes.  
Now, she did apologize for all the delays and gave me a gift card to use and the food was good.  Service was really poor.  I don't understand how two people can read your order off to you and then the kitchen can't get it made.  In my estimation, I must have waited until at least 6:15 until we received our full order of food.  
I'm hoping they were just having a bad night but they do need to work some bugs out of their online ordering system."}
{"text":"Hit or miss depending on what you order and who's working. Classics like Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken are always safe, but I'm usually disappointed when I try something new here. Stay away from the wonton soup - no veggies, just salty broth and wontons. Recently I tried the Thai style lettuce wraps and was not impressed. It was way too spicy for me, and lacked any real flavor other than being hot. 

The woman at the counter was friendly and helpful, but when I asked an employee clearing tables for a fork, she told me to get one from the drink station. When I replied that there were no forks, she told me they were washing them all. What kind of restaurant runs out of forks on Friday at 130pm? There were two sets of plastic silverware at the drink station, but we needed three. Spoke with the same employee regarding the plastic forks, and she looked miserable dealing with my request, but went to get us another plastic fork. I'm sorry, two plastic forks doesn't cut it when there are three at a table.

Not that big of a deal, but my dad's fortune cookie didn't have a fortune. I guess he wasn't too lucky that day."}
{"text":"\"What were they thinking?\" is exactly what I thought. A friend and I visited this location today thinking we were going to PeiWei. Apparently, it is now a PeiWei Market. I knew something was up right away when we walked in. Not only was the decor totally different (looked like the food court at the mall), but there was nobody in there. Used to be difficult to even find a parking space. Not any more. I order my food and she asks me what size I want. I should have left then. Instead, I played along and ordered my food. $12.35 later, my number was yelled by the zit faced teenagers that work at this place, and I picked up my food. Looked like a damn lean cuisine, only not as good. It was served in the same plastic container and was about the same size. Everything is now served on to-go plastic, whether you are eating it there or not. Plastic tray, plastic dish, plastic fork, plastic cups. 

The most amusing part was to watch people walk in and order. When they received their food, they had this bewildered look on there face, like what the hell is this? Where am I? Everyone around us was not happy. Rather than convert an existing store, they should have just built a new one. Anyone who ate at PeiWei before, will surely not like the new changes. This concept will fail. 

Anyone who is considering PeiWei Market, save your money. Stay home and fix yourself a lean cuisine. Your wallet and palette will thank you."}
{"text":"My least favorite location. Our lettuce for the lettuce wraps was wilted and brown, as a matter of fact most of the vegetables were far from fresh. Very poor quality overall."}
{"text":"Pei Wei has a great menu and prices are very reasonable when you get a small portion.  There is good variety between traditional, thai, sushi and now pole.  Kids meals are a good deal and food is always fresh and high quality.  I don't get the knock on prices because it is price equal to other asian casual restaurants.  Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices and fast service. What more could you ask for? If, you never tried  Pei Wei yet,your missing out, four shore. You gotta go, try them hurry. Better then rip off- Pf chang's. There o.k, But at Pei Wei same stuff, but better and reasonably priced. And you don't have to tip a waiter,because there isn't one....."}
{"text":"Better than buffet, really clean place I like the concept  mandarin kung pao was good however is missing the 'wow' factor..."}
{"text":"Westernized Asian  food with a bit of a modern american spin. That is my impression of Pei Wei Asian Diner. The food is certainly tasty enough, and has earned my business on several occasions. If you're like me and like to know what type of asian food you're eating, this is \"pan-asian\", although it largely resembles amercanized chinese food reinterpreted in much the same way taco-bell is a dramatic reinterpretation of Mexican food-- which is to say that it isn't authentic at all but it isn't necessarily bad. A previous reviewer described them as \"the discount little brother of PF Changs\". I would absolutely agree-- your food will come out a bit faster and is probably a little bit lighter in portion size than at Changs.

I've had several dishes including various combinations of crispy noodles, sweet sauce, spicy vegetables and so on. I once had a sweet and sour chicken salad that was interesting. It's the sort of place you might find yourself craving at the end of a long day of studying. You can always call ahead and pick it up to go. Dining there isn't particularly enjoyable-- service is ok. My problem, as a moderate food snob, is that if I am craving excellent korean bbq or real thai curry, I know that I simply cannot find that here. If you want the real thing and nothing else will do, then this place will not do. That's not to say that I am against this establishment-- it's perfectly good food that has a certain flavor to it that is not replicated by the authentic places. After all, if you are craving Pizza Hut, it's not traditional neopolitan pizza that you want-- it's frickin Pizza Hut you want. So come here if you wish, try em out-- you might become a Pei Wei fan, which would be convenient because you can find this chain all over the country."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and had their sushi.  It was pretty tasty but next time I'll definitely get something else.  I'll leave the sushi for my favorite places.  This place is my favorite for many other things like lettuce wraps"}
{"text":"Used to be a weekly visitor. Not sure what happened, but Pei Wei has derailed. Food is mediocre. Portions are much smaller, and the dining area is filthy. Basics like napkins and lids aren't even stocked. So much trash was outside there were flocks of birds swarming the patio. This was my last visit unfortunately."}
{"text":"How they don't get shut down by health code violations is shocking! The whole place could use a deep cleaning. Soda machines are probably infested with bacteria by the sight of the outside. The managers need to assign someone to this since they are too lazy to care for their place."}
{"text":"Manager offered me a free Veg Fried Rice while waiting for the food to come at my table. Best place."}
{"text":"First off let me start off by saying I L-O-V-E Pei Wei. I eat there at least twice a month. I've gone to this location several times, and each time is simply a disaster. When I go out to eat I expect what I pay for and that's quality food as well as service. Before I go any further I would like to say the food is great! always hot and ready and sometimes even before the initial pick up time. What is so disappointing is every time without fail my order in some way some how my order is messed up. My order is only for two people MAX. Which I don't find too hard to execute. Maybe its the person taking the orders? Maybe its the Take Out system? Maybe a simple chicken over fried rice is too complicated? What ever the problem is I hope its fixed."}
{"text":"I'm a constant customer here with my boyfriend. Today, there was a new cashier whom automatically was rude and honestly creepy. 
Our food came out, my boyfriend ordered Kung Pao chicken, yet there was shrimp in it. I went over to the cashier to tell him, he replies with \"that's what he ordered.\" I then tell him, \"no he ordered Kung Pao chicken- no shrimp.\" He continues to argue with me \"nope he told me shrimp I heard him.\" After waiting awhile, our food comes & he comes to our table & says \"I gave you your drinks for free if that makes you feel better.\" Even though we both ordered water, but thanks. 
I wouldn't recommend coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Orange Chicken is the best so is Mongolian Beef. Would be 5 stars but the dining room could be a lot cleaner. Seems to be this way every time I come here."}
{"text":"Great food, nice staff but in the late afternoon (when it' was very slow) there was literally not ONE clean table and I'm talking over 20 tables."}
{"text":"Pretty bad when you attempt to call your order in while you are traveling and you are on \"perpetual\" hold. NO ONE answered the phone for the 15 minutes I was on hold. At this point I arrived to find all employee's sitting (except for the chef)  around or chasing each other around the restaurant.Not one of them could be bothered to pick up the phone. So I placed my order and sat down to wait. The table was filthy, sticky and all around disgusting.  Your store should be CLOSED."}
{"text":"Good thing the food is good and reasonably priced- only reason I return. 
They are SLOW!!! It seems like they never have enough workers. If they are going to take app & phone orders they should have 1-2 people focused only on those orders. Every single time I have pre ordered on the app I have still had to wait a good half hour. 
The girls aren't especially friendly either."}
{"text":"This was just my second time ever having Pei Wei and first time at this location. The place is busy at lunch but everything moves really fast. If the weather is nice, sit outside. There are 6 4-person tables and 5 2-person tables.

I tried the ginger broccoli rice bowl which is fresh and has a nice sweetness to it. I opted for brown rice to be a bit healthier and was glad they had that as an option. The dish comes with a lot of rice, so it's possible you won't finish it all."}
{"text":"Pei Wei was a regular haunt of mine in my single days especially when I worked long consultant hours. Their food was dependable, fast and they were wherever I was working. This was in the DFW metroplex area. 

Then came Vegas. There is no Pei Wei close to my home and I realized I never do crave it. For something I used to have once a week, a non-craving for Pei Wei  really did mean I must not have liked their food that much. I confirmed that suspicion today. 

I ordered the Kid's Teriyaki Bowl with Tofu and Veggies. Brown rice at no extra charge. Definitely a plus point. I find the portions at Pei Wei too big and so the kids portion suffices and is actually a bit large still for me. I love that they allow someone clearly older than 12 to qualify for this portion. Kudos to Pei Wei. I usually order an extra serving of Tofu and Veggies and that is what I did today. 3.95 for the kids bowl and $2 for the extra tofu/veggie serving. 

What I got at my table (in a very timely manner) was a dish that met all my expectations. Generous heaping of tofu with snow peas. carrots and broccoli. In Dallas, I remember this dish as having spinach which was something I missed today. The tofu here is different from anywhere else. It's long and seems rather dehydrated. But it actually tastes rather pleasant. 

Pei Wei is true American Chinese Food. Created in America, for Americans. It's definitely not as tasty as PF Changs but they do offer dependable fare that CAN be made fairly healthy (if you choose to exercise portion control) and it's a nice spot to hang for a quick lunch. 

I guess dependability means this place is A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"We love the food here but tonight the service was not the best. There were 3 of us, we each ordered a meal plus one togo meal. 2 out of the 3 meals came right away, after 5 or so minutes I asked for the last meal & was told it would be right out. Another 10 minutes passed & 2 of us are done & went to the manager & explained the situation. Nevertheless we ended with an extra meals."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Americanized Asian-inspired food joints, but I enjoy Pei Wei. Right now there is a promotion for a BOGO, so for $8 I was able to feed two mouths with plenty of leftovers. 

I had the chicken pad thai, which had an ample portion of meat and tofu. I really can't complain about it; it tastes like any chicken pad thai I have eaten before. Unfortunately my boyfriend's chicken fried rice wasn't so great. He asked for no red bell peppers; instead they put in green bell peppers and a ton of scallions.  The menu doesn't even say green bell peppers in the description. 

I'll come back for the pad thai. It cost less and comes in a bigger portion than ordering from a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place to get a quick meal.  My ginger broccoli steak was good.  I like the updated decor at this new location."}
{"text":"I have had Chinese food three times in the last two weeks.  Each time I ordered beef with broccoli, among other things.  It was prepared the best at Pei Wei.  The seasonings are just right here.

Quick, priced right and plenty of fortune cookies.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"First time at Pei Wei after a day of moving, and I didn't know what to expect.  I felt a little rushed, though, because of the line behind me and I wasn't sure of the items on the menu, or how the combo worked vs. a specialty meal.  Plus not all of the items on the menu had prices so I couldn't judge much by that either.  I randomly chose the Honey Seared Shrimp dish, which was delicious, but I felt guilty with every bite since it was so heavily covered in the honey sauce.  Love the rice noodles with it though!  First came the WonTon soup to share, which was okay.  Then 4 pc. Crab Wontons, also, okay.  Others ordered the Teriyaki chicken combo, and liked it a lot, but thought the Spring rolls were boring.  They agreed that for $3 more they would have gotten the specialty dish and skipped the roll, while I thought for $3 more I got almost the same amount of meat as they did.  Overall, I don't think I'd go out of my way to go there again, but wouldn't pass it up if the opportunity arose with friends, and I had some extra $$ on hand.  I do agree with others who it was better than P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"Try the tofu. Please try the tofu. It's phenomenal. Even if you don't like tofu, get the sesame sauce with tofu. It's slightly crisp and wonderfully chewy. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I usually love this Place but I went yesterday and I was soooo sick. By the end of the night I was curled up in a ball sobbing. I couldn't even stand up straight. This was in my top 10 restaurants but now I'm so scared to eat here again. ):"}
{"text":"Throughly enjoyed coming to Pei Wei on a Monday night but the experience would have been much better for me if they didn't run out of sushi. I did end up getting the honey chicken bowl and it was a better alternative to Panda Express. I don't enjoy greasy food very much and Pei Wei did not disappoint on that part. Overall, the atmosphere was great, the food was good and I do recommend it if you enjoy Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Another mediocre service experience. We eat here a lot and the service during our last several visits has not been so great. My husband orders the Asian slaw and he always has to ask our server to get it when our food comes. Food always comes many minutes apart so one of us has to wait so we can eat together.
Today was my friend's birthday and we ordered lettuce wraps and 2 entrees. Entrees came first (with the wrong rice on one) and lettuce wraps after the entrees. When I mentioned we might have liked our appetizers first, I got a who- cares look from the server. Might not be going back to this location after this."}
{"text":"I swear I wrote a review about this place. At any rate a nice place to go for a quick bite to eat. The have customized my lettuce wraps each time because I don't want all the sodium that is added (makes them very salty). I have been more times than I have checked in.and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Yum for lettuce chicken wraps.. Double Yum to lettuce chicken wraps made with low sodium soy sauce. FAIL for having so many tables with dirty plates and food left out. I mean it was bad. We grabbed one the last clean tables that was left in the place. By the time we left, only half of them had been cleaned, yet there was plenty of staff ( from what I could tell) that could have easily taken care of this situation.  At any rate the food was good so that is a plus but the surrounding area left a bad taste in my mouth ( no pun intended)"}
{"text":"Have always loved this place but had a bad experience today. Very long wait and then my chicken came out burnt. It was cut into pieces so the cook surely would have noticed it was burned but still served it anyway. I ordered the chow mein chicken, other than being burnt the rest of the meal was average."}
{"text":"We stopped at the Pei Wei on Raintree for dinner yesterday. Normally we go to the Summit location when we go to Pei Wei but this time the one on Raintree was more convenient. I think we'll continue to go to the Summit and avoid this one. The noise in the restaurant makes conversation nearly impossible. People who work there are obviously not told that loud banging and crashing sounds do not make for a pleasant dining experience. I ordered Pad Thai and while some of the flavors were good, it was was missing the egg, tofu, bean sprouts, cilantro and peanuts. We cleared our own table so we'd have a place to sit. The place wasn't very busy so it left the impression it's not a well-run operation and there is no quality control. I like Pei Wei but this location needs an on-duty manager."}
{"text":"It was nice that the cashier said \"OK\" when notified about the hair in my salad this evening. I wish he would have demonstrated an interest by telling the manager or coming to the table to look at the hair to see if he could identify the source, but maybe this is such a common complaint that customers should understand not to bother them with trivia. Personally, I prefer my food clean and free of foreign matter. I live nearby but won't be coming back anymore."}
{"text":"As being a huge fan of Chinese cuisine, we tried this one, and trust me you'll never disappoint. As being on the vegetarian side, we picked the vegetable spring rolls for the starter.
Then for the main course we ordered the rice bowl, pie wei classic noodles \"orange peel\", and last but not the least, their salad bowl. 
We enjoyed every bite.
Very welcoming staff and give nice suggestions. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this location around 9:00 on 4/21/17. The food was good, but I wouldnt give it 5 stars. Our pot stickers came out cold and the chicken in or entres seemed tough and on the dry side, but overall it was decent. The tables could be better maintained and wiped down, but we also came later and they probably just had their dinner rush. The person that stood out to us was Hector, his service was outstanding! He went around to the guests and asked how everything was, making sure we were all taken care of. Between running food to customers and bussing tables, I couldnt believe how great his customer service was while also being efficient and maintaining the lobby. Great job Hector, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great for takeout. It tastes much better than Panda Express. I've tried a few different dishes and they all seemed very good. The parking at the Summerlin location is very convenient. And I love how you can order with the app, it's so fast and easy. It's my to go when I don't have time to go to restaurant or don't want to eat junk.."}
{"text":"I love the honey seared shrimp and my son likes the honey chicken. Everything is great here. The service has always been friendly and the food always comes out so quickly. Lettuce wraps, Mongolian beef, egg rolls.... all of it is great."}
{"text":"\"Did you change your menu?\"

No

\"Then what is this?  I ordered Chicken Lettuce Wraps\"

Oh, you ordered them spicy, so those are the *NEW* Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps.

...

Don't try to guess what I want, and give me an entirely different dish.  Also, I'm pretty sure if you are referring to a dish as new, it means the menu has changed."}
{"text":"I am just going to review this experience. The customer service was good. My niece ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken with Broccoli only, none of the other veggies. I had Teriyaki Chicken. Both were good. Lots of meat and veggies and the rice was cooked just right. The reason for the 1 star review is my niece got violently ill. She had food poisoning. She was visiting from out of town so this took a whole day out of her vacation and basically ruined it. I know things happen, but something slipped threw the cracks this day and cleanliness or food prep was not at the top of the list. We eat at Pei Wei a lot, but we wont be back anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22..
I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, \"Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS.\" So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future."}
{"text":"The customer service is lacking.  My kids do not like the sauce on the kids meals and although they always have they will no longer substitute the sauce.  The employee was not very friendly that took our order or apologetic when telling us that they will no longer accommodate our preferences.  So they up charged me because I had to order it separately. I guess we will be going to another location from now on.  This was my kids favorite place to eat.  Not anymore."}
{"text":"Would have been 4 stars, but they recently raised their prices on the entrees.  It's caused me to just get noodle dishes or avoid the place all together.  Too bad..."}
{"text":"I have frequented this PeiWei restaurant for many years. While I honestly think  the quality of food, taste and service has sharply declined at all Pei Wei restaurants , it is most apparent at this one. Upon walking into the restaurant, the boards were dimly lit and one of them was not working. In addition, the restaurant was in shambles. There was food all over the floors and on the tables. My son and I actually had to wipe rice off of one of the tables to sit down to eat. When our food arrived, it was unrecognizable. We both had ordered to the Orange Peel  Chicken. They must've change the recipe because it was grilled and didn't have any orange peelings on the plate. In addition, the sauce was runny and the chicken was so black it was burnt. I have never had such horrible food at this restaurant so I'm extremely disappointed. In addition, the soda machine was almost out of all the different types of soda. After taking two bites of our food, I asked to speak with the manager, and I told him that I was really disappointed with the food and the appearance of the restaurant. I asked for my money back, which he refunded my entire meal, so I was very appreciative of that. However, I know PeiWei in general is in decline, and I they are moving their corporate office out of state and away from Phoenix. I also know that they've had about four CEOs in the past three years or so. They just can't seem to get their act together. I will probably not go back to this restaurant again, as it was such a disappointing experience. What is going on with these restaurants? They used to be a great place for me to take my family, enjoy a good meal and appreciate clean ambiance. Now, they have turned into the sad little \"me too\" Asian restaurants that don't do anything for me. Very sad. So long Pei Wei... I would not recommend eating at this one, or probably any others. They seem to be in a huge decline and I will be surprised if they stay in business for another year."}
{"text":"I wrote this restaurant off 2 years ago. The menu was boring and frankly the food was not good anymore. 

Last night my husband suggested we try it agin. I was reluctant but agreed. Boy am I glad we did. I ordered the pork egg roll and chicken teriyaki with brown rice. The egg roll was so good, the best I have had in years. The egg roll is large and served with a mustard sauce which is a great compliment to this egg roll...YUM!! The chicken was moist with the right amount of sauce and perfectly cooked veggies. The prices are very reasonable and the service was fast. 

Ok, I am back on board now. If you want to order take out, give yourself sufficient time as the takeout is very busy."}
{"text":"Not a huge selection but what they do have, they do well. Pei Wei is just a fancy Panda Express. The food is much better but the prices are triple what you would pay at a fast food place. If you're in the mood for decent Chinese food and don't have the time to spend in a Chinese restaurant, Pei Wei is the place to go. Good food but a bit on the pricy side."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful experience last week at this location. Food came quickly, everything was hot and tasted great. The general manager Ron took extra time and attention to stop by and check in, bring extra plates and chat. He also cleared plates and ensured our dining experience was flawless. We had our 3 children in tow and the extra thoughtfulness and help was appreciated and didn't go unnoticed. I was very impressed and thankful."}
{"text":"Went to Pei Wei's for my first time and I was impressed. Good prices for lunch and plenty of food. The chicken I had was cooked to perfection! The only reason I have four stars was because of the service, I think the service could have been a tad better. Our food was cooked and ready to go and they didn't bring it out right away and they weren't too busy, but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Been there twice and we share a large sweet n sour chicken and we get a large crab rangoon. That's excellent and enough to fill us up. Very tasty."}
{"text":"I went here last Friday. I had the ginger tofu on brown rice. It was nasty, full of white sugar snd salt. The really bad part was the msg headache i got from it. They say no msg but i only get sick like that from msg and everything else i had eaten for days was my own home cooking.

It was a free lunch but that headache made it so not worth it.  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Hate ordering new dishes, maybe the cooks don't know how to make it.  I ordered the Bangkok peanut noodles, take out.  Got it home, no peanut garnish, no lime, no ginger taste, the tofu was dried and hard.  The cook should have hydrated the tofu, the dish was tasteless and a waste of money....threw 3/4 of the dish in the trash.  Either train the cooks or its time to find another place to eat."}
{"text":"I did a 1 put of 5 stars on Pei Wei  over a year ago, due to poor quality foods, like slimy lettuce on my lettuce wraps (it happened twice).  I was contacted by management that apologized and said they would send a gift card never came it was just b.s.  I was going to try Pei Wei again, hopefully they would have remedy the poor quality of their dishes, but I seen on April 13, 2018, they hit the dirty dining awards with 7 violations, I guess I'm going back to Panda, at least the dishes have a better quality than Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I've always wondered what this place was all about. I had the Chicken Pad Thai and it was ok, not impressed with it and was a bit disappointed. It was a little too soupy for me, which it shouldn't..so that was a sign already. Anyways, my kids ordered a chicken teriyaki and sweet and sour chicken...they hardly ate their food as it was bland and didn't taste like it should..I tried it for myself and it was pretty bland so I wouldn't recommend it ordering that again. I had better Chinese food a lower price."}
{"text":"Love The Food here! I always order the pad thai and sushi. recently tried their new Kungpao shrimp roll and I loved it. Quite surprised to see all the bad reviews this location has gotten, I've never had a problem here."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy cutting the roof of your mouth on burnt spring rolls? 

Slicing into my delicate palate is typically a cherished experience that lasts for days as I run my tongue over the loose flaps of skin left behind by the sharp edges of over-toasted sandwich bread; today my adoration for mouth injuries seems to be on a hiatus.

My fickle love affair with Pei Wei ended the moment I discovered they discontinued the green coconut curry dish, however, I do occasionally break down for some tofu Pad Thai and the occasional crab won ton.

The location on 7th Ave and McDowell is conveniently located and has become a place where I make emergency dining decisions. 

A mere month ago a friend of mine and I dined in for a business meeting and the service was so horrible and inconsistent with the menu description that the manager, Anthony, gave us a $10 gift card credit to use the next time we came in in addition to a comp of the dish in question.

I appreciate that the management was willing to save a couple of potential repeat customers, kudos for that.

Anthony, if you are still managing this location; please stop doing so many lines of cocaine during your break. Perhaps drinking on the job and soliciting young, impressionable cashiers is not the best use of your time. 

Whatever it is that you are doing Mr. or Ms. manager of Pei Wei Downtown Phoenix, please stop it at once and focus on the piss poor quality of food that you are cranking out on the regular. 

My Pad Thai was soggy, overcooked and flavorless. Unless they have recently updated their recipes, I would wager to say that this was sent back by an in-house patron and re-heated for my enjoyment.  The potstickers were blackened around the edges and cooked to the point where the insides had shriveled to the size of a nickel.  

No matter how hungry I get, I will never in all of my days spend another dime in this establishment.

{"text":"First time trying Pei Wei, the taste is so heavy. I drink a lot water!"}
{"text":"I have tried this location twice now and will for sure be back. You can place your order online and it is very user friendly. I wanted to make changes to what I was ordering and there was a option to customize it so I didn't have to worry about phoning it in or ordering in person I was just able to easily and accurately place my order online. 

I started with a \"Pork Egg Roll\". These were addicting like candy. Great flavor and decent size for $2.00. I had the \"Chicken Lettuce Wraps\" for my meal. The chicken has such good flavor. The lettuce is fresh and crisp. This is one I might have a hard time not ordering each time. My man had the \"Lo Mein With Spicy Beef\". I sampled some of the noodles and was hooked. I had to steal a few more bites. The noodles weren't dry and had so much flavor. 

They have a gluten free menu.

If you don't want to get your food to go they have a dining area.

They cater.

Since signing up on the website to order online they have sent me a couple good coupons good on my next visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food I've had in my life. Ordered the spicy Korean with chicken and I received 4 small pieces of chicken that was microwaved and a sauce that tasted like blended diarrhea. Worst part was no sriracha to drown this crap in. Also the price was outrageous. I would highly recommend Panda Express if you want to eat crap but save a little money."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. They operate with a sense of urgency. The food quality is always high. The have the fancy coke machine. Stop reading go there for lunch."}
{"text":"The food wasn't great. It was different compared to Pei Wei meals I've had in the past. 

I've been to this location a couple of times and though there's staff to clean the tables, the tables and drink/utensil station always look like they need to be wiped down.

I wouldn't have minded, but the quality of the food wasn't worth the price.

I probably won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Found this place, it was super busy. The portions were somewhat small. We had the Mongolian Wok bowl and the Low Mein. The Low Mein wasn't very flavorful, kind of bland tasting."}
{"text":"Food was great, food was incredibly quick considering it was very busy. The hostess, young dark hair girl, was stressed and told us so on the night of 1/20, which was a shame. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times.   It's convenient and the food is made to order.    The employees are very friendly and helpful.

The food is tasty and fresh.   On recent visits we have had:   Teriyaki Crunch Roll (good texture and flavor), Pei Wei Spicy (even with double veggies there were still too few veggies for me and far too much rice), Asian Chopped Chicken Salad (lettuce was a little 'tired' but overall ok)."}
{"text":"Yummy! The go-to place when your wallet or time cannot meet P.F. Changs! They just recently discontinued the Bangkok Bowl (soooo PISSED!)  Instead tried the Dan Dan Noodles and OH. EM. GEE!  So flippin good! They also have some cut oranges by the drink fountains, which i throw in the to-go containers and eat for dessert. ;-) Not fine dinning but excellent quality for the price."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is chill. The restaurant was clean and staff friendly."}
{"text":"We love Pei Wei!! We see they renovated!! Looks great!! And as usually the food is always great!! Service is exceptional!! Sushi is good here too!!"}
{"text":"Large lunch order is placed hours ahead of time. Head on over to pay and pick up our food (20 lunch orders) and we are told that the order was canceled \"for some odd reason\"...

No communication from the restaurant or management. How is such a large order cancelled without any form of communication?

Extremely displeased and discouraged that this can happen from a chain with a usually good reputation. 

UN-AMERICAN!"}
{"text":"It's good quick \"Asian\" cuisine. I have never had a bad meal here, and I have always had great service. No complaints here. Again....its \"Asian\". Don't come here expecting legit Asian food. However, it's feels a little lighter than regular Chinese places."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! I always go with my boyfriend we get the California rolls love the mango they out in it! Also the lettuce wraps, and honey seared chicken are fantastic! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I love Pei Wei! This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired in the way of service and quality control. It's near my office, and I've placed online orders three separate times and the orders have been incomplete/incorrect all three times. In addition, I haven't seen them greet anyone coming in to pick up an order.  No one is rude, but they could use additional customer service training and definitely have someone check the orders thoroughly prior to handing them over..."}
{"text":"I wish they have lunch portions that were smaller.

Pei Wei created their Asian Diner concept at 7th St and Glendale.  I ate there and didn't like how they re-arranged the place, but I did like the smaller portions.  PLEASE, PLEASE roll out the smaller lunch portions at all Pei Wei locations!!!

The service here is just like I have come to expect at any Pei Wei I have visited.  On one visit that manager has made sure everything was as expected.

I will definately be back for my normal lunch escape from the office."}
{"text":"Fast food quality, extremely slow service.  The food is usually decent but can definitely be hit or miss. The service on the other hand ranges from slow to extremely slow.  They need to hire some more people to handle lunch service, don't come here if you have anywhere to be."}
{"text":"I would consider ourselves regulars here as our kids love their teriyaki chicken. The problem has been that over the last couple of months, the quality of food has gone seriously down hill. Excellent service, but there seems to be an issue with food as it comes off the line. Food is overcooked (and not just a little), and the attention to detail is completely lacking. As a cook, there does not seem to be any pride in the food that is coming out, nor is anyone, who is not cooking, checking the food. This is unfortunate as it hasn't always been like this. I understand that there are pressures in the restaurant industry, but this has gotten pretty bad. I am not sure that we will be going back for some time."}
{"text":"I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following:

-it's cheap
-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)
-there is plenty to choose from on the menu
-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...

That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.

I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!

PS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... I will not be returning to (this) Pei Wei any time soon..."}
{"text":"Came to try the new pad thai recipe. it's great. portions are huge. love the freestyle soda machines. downsides: really noisy, really crowded, and food took longer than usual to come out. no one likes seeing people who ordered after them get their food before them."}
{"text":"been here lots of times. the food is quite good each time, and comes out fast. it's a predictable place with a decent atmosphere and is something of a known quantity for food. nothing spectacular but definitely a routine spot I come to. I like the pad thai, the Mongolian, and the honey chicken or shrimp. lettuce wraps are always a really good go-to dish here. seems like the prices just keep going up over time, though. eventually they will price themselves out of the market when you consider you can get better food for near the same price at their sister restaurant PF Changs."}
{"text":"Food quality and amount was decent. The reason I am giving this two stars only is primarily due to cleanliness. The floors were full of food particles throughout in the dining area. Also even though the flooring in the bathroom was dark it, and the toilet sink door and mirror were not cleaned in quite some time. It was not just after rush hour either. We were there at 5 pm. I don't think I can risk it again. Just too unsanitary"}
{"text":"This place has really good Pan Asian food.  I go here probably twice a month, convenient location however the parking is not the best, usually crowded."}
{"text":"So they changed their noodles... bad call, the new ones are a bit tough....
Got a hair in my food 2 out of the last few visits...
I'm not sure but I think they are trying cost savings ideas with the food, the quality is definitely sliding....
I have cut my visits back quite a bit...."}
{"text":"Yelp says this place closes at 9:30; got there at 8:59 and tried to place an order for carry out but rudely got told they were closed even though there were people ordering food. There are no hours posted on the doors for confirmation of business hours. Called another location that yelp also has listed as open until 9:30 and was greeted by a very sweet lady with great hospitality skills and was able to place an order for pick up. Won't be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Ate here and everything was spot-on. Kung Pao chicken was perfect. The service was excellent from the young lady that took our order to the other young lady that brought our food. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"I've always had a satisfactory experience at this location. The only exception is when I've branched out and tried their sushi. It's strange that they're packaging includes a sticker to inform the customer to store the sushi at a particular temperature, but every time I've ordered the sushi, they package it on top of hot food, so by the time I pick it up the sushi is warm. Last time I ordered it, I just threw it away fearing food poisoning. So in other words, stick to the regular menu items."}
{"text":"This place is filthy, the drink machines haven't been cleaned in what looks like weeks and they are out of lids for small drinks"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with all the times I've come here! Great service, super friendly, good food (this is owned by PF Changs), reasonably priced and quick service! A great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the GF Spicy Chicken with brown rice.  It's nice because the price is good and my husband tries to steal my chicken so you know it's good!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is fast, inexpensive, and tastes great. I love the exhibition kitchen where they make your food out in the open. It's rather noisy but I like that in-the-thick-of-things atmosphere!

The Asian menu items are mostly very good. I don't care for the orange chicken here, but it's my husband's favorite. I go for the spicy kung pao chicken, although a few times it has been too salty. I also really enjoy the lettuce wraps. They are listed on the appetizer menu, but they make a great meal of themselves. Pei Wei has gotten a bit too trendy for me since we first started eating here, but I guess they deserve the success!"}
{"text":"Love the food, but their application of their seating policy is poor. If you're going to enforce the \"no one in your party may sit down until you've completed your order\" you better be Johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to bussing tables."}
{"text":"Let me explain the one star, the food here is yummy, but the restaurant needs to step up on cleanliness.  Hire some more people to bus your many dirty tables and sweep up the floors.  Can't understand how so many food places keep their places dirty"}
{"text":"Slowest fast food you can imagine. Don't come here unless you have 30 minutes to wait for a bowl of rice. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"A wise man once told me, \"Don't teach the 'gwei lo' new tricks.\"  I never understood what that meant until I ate here."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Pei Wei?!?  The food and service is always good and it's a quicker, cheaper version of P.F. Changs.  On top of that they are constantly offering coupons and promotions through social media and email.  I can't even remember the last time I paid full price.  Last week I even received coupons through snail mail.  I usually call in my order to avoid the wait.  I'm a fan of the honey seared chicken and the spring rolls."}
{"text":"I must start this by saying I have been a long time customer and fan of Pei Wei. However, tonight this location has failed yet again and you have lost my business for good. 

Appearance and cleanliness
1 star

This place is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY... No care to the outside of the property or inside. Outside you have grease and food trails all the way to the dumpster which is open and in full view of the front door.. might consider trying to hide the garbage and buy a pressure washer or hire a weekly service. Just gross! Inside the floors were covered in rice and food all over. Worn decor the has this location screaming I'm in need of some maintenance and remodeling. Even the bricks behind the wok stations were dirty and stainless steel racks above where they are cooking your meals were cover in old dryer food! GROSS! 

This isn't the reason for the overall 1 star.

Food 4stars.  Service 1 star
This is the only reason Pei Wei has my business. Food is great. When they don't mess up your order.  Out of  the last 6 visits, 3 of those times the order was incorrect. All To Go orders both placed in person and phone. You've proven that it doesn't matter. This location just does not have a good quality control. Tonight your manager comes out to us as we were waiting for our TO GO order, an apologizes that the kitchen made the order wrong and it was being remade. I was great...yet again another bad experience, to try to make it right she did give us $20 gift card. Where this manager failed is my order when I pulled it out of the bag at home ...WAS WRONG! YES, all that extra wait and I still had to call and eat a meal I did not order, WTF! How does this happen, receipt clearly states shrimp and steak. No shrimp whatsoever that I paid extra for. 

If you do not fix this locations problems, I see it closing. I spoke w my neighbors and they said they don't eat there either because of similar experiences. Such a shame. Owners/Corporate needs to get out of their offices and see the issues the hired help from the Management on down has been neglecting."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at Pei Wei. If you like spicy, ask for extra spicy. More spicy? Ask for extra, extra spicy.

I recommend the mandarin kung pow.  Get a spring roll with sweet chili sauce too.

They are very accompanying with special requests. Always tasty!"}
{"text":"I love the kung pow chicken and my last visit this week did not disappoint. I ask for extra-extra spicy with extra peanuts with fried rice (splurging as I rarely eat rice).

My entree was fresh and very hot and as spicy as I wanted. The combination of spicy, peanuts and the wok-seared chicken is amazing. I love the snap peas and carrots too.  The rice was fresh and tasty as well.

Coke Freestyle and Apple Pay, hooray!

I couldn't ask for more, and if you have an Amex card, there is deal (until 2/2016) too!"}
{"text":"I order using the website which is very easy and you can customize your order. I would like to add comments to make my order extra-extra spicy though.

This location has a separate area for order pick up and my orders are always available on time.  Chopsticks, utensils & soy sauce is offered for your bag."}
{"text":"I can't help but to give Pei Wei a good review every time, perhaps I just am a generous reviewer? For what it is though, it's pretty good. I went in and tried their new Black Pepper Chicken, knowing me,  I of course added snap peas, they did not remove the little spiny things, but I'm pretty easy going... It was a sad portion of asparagus as well, but overall I found it to be delicious! My son, again had the kid Lomein (sp?), which I can't convince him away from, loaded with extra veggies for an additional $1.00... I dig it even though they've declined over the years... I must be addicted to the sodium content (msg???), meh, oh well, I'm likely a customer for life."}
{"text":"First time here and bummed I waited so long!! Food was delish!! Great service and super clean!!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad for a quick lunch. They are pretty fast and reasonably priced. Why the 3 stars? In my option, everything tastes exactly the same. The spice level may change, but I have never had anything unique here. It's not bad, but also not my first choice either."}
{"text":"This place is not bad for a quick lunch in downtown Gilbert. They are pretty fast and reasonably priced. Why the 3 stars? In my option, everything tastes exactly the same. The spice level may change, but I have never had anything unique here. It's not bad, but also not my first choice either."}
{"text":"I don't know how to drill it into my friends that I've met here in Arizona...PEI WEI AND PF CHANG'S IS  N O T AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD.

I've gone here 4 times, each with different friends and *gasp* my husband. This is the one place where he and I don't see eye to eye on. I told him after my last time there if he wants to go, he will have to find friends to go with. I'll be anywhere but there.

I've had their pad thai with chicken, fried rice with shrimp, ginger broccoli and asian coconut curry...each time I've been massively disappointed.

With their pad thai, there was an over abundane of sauce that should not be soaking into my food. It was extremely bitter and a bit sour as well. The chicken had been overdone.  yuck.

Their fried rice with shrimp was ok, even though I had specifically asked that no scallions and no peppers be put in (peppers in my friend rice?  WTF?!). It was bogged down with far too much soy sauce for my liking. Like they had literally soaked it over night in soy sauce. I could manage to eat half of it before the soy sauce made me stop.

The other dishes were passable, but again, I won't be going back here voluntarily. I think I'd rather eat at California Pizza Kitchen before ever setting foot in here again...actually, I think I may actually go to Rumbi's before Pei Wei.

The atmosphere wasn't so bad, but it was loud. The open kitchen and hearing all the clattering of plates can get to you after a while. Mercifully the times I've been there were no screaming children, but I've heard horror stories from some friends that go there on a regular basis. I've been lucky.

I just could never get a feel for the place - I never bonded with it. Maybe because it just never felt like fully authentic Chinese food.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but this place is way off for me."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for so long and was craving some Asian inspired dishes. I ordered my favorite, the Mongolian beef with brown rice. Just as I remembered it, very flavorful and a decent portion. They now have sushi as an appetizer but it wasn't that great. I wasn't expecting it to be so I was not that disappointed.  I tried some of my wife's honey glazed chicken. It was pretty good, tasting similar to sweet and sour chicken. Our food was brought out in a timely manner by the very friendly and personable server, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Burnt rice, not the look of it just the taste. Not the cleanest pei wei, however the food is consistent. I will continue to go to the avondale/good year location."}
{"text":"Good gosh this place has run downhill. Our entrees provided mere shadows of the former quality level of the food here. Both the Pei Wei Spicy as well as the Sesame Chicken were nuclear salt bombs. Don't really know what the actual taste would have been."}
{"text":"Its good quick and consistent with the rest of the chain.  Nice patio with misters, great to grab a bite and sit back with a coffee from next door."}
{"text":"We ordered the Dan Dan noodles and Thai coconut curry chicken. The noodles were a little over cooked but still very tasty. The curry was bland, peppers were cold, and green beans were hard(not crunchy but not cooked). The service is very slow and employees are visibly arguing with each other. Very poor training and leadership at this pei wei."}
{"text":"This is a solid fast casual Asian place! I was craving orange chicken something bad and pei wei delivered! Cheap prices, quick food delivery, and hot delicious food! Love the touch screen soda machine, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had Vietnamese rice noodle salad. only 4 noodles in the bottom of the bowl. I kept saying, where are the noodles??? the rest was lettuce. and only about 4 tiny pieces of chicken.  not good. my friend had shrimp fried rice. only about 4 small shrimp. not good. used to love this place, but not any more. i felt like i wasted my money. (went there about two weeks ago for dinner).  will never go back. and i was a fan. too bad they are not good anymore. what is going on with pei wei. new management? owners? ugh."}
{"text":"Ate here the other day. Pei Wei used to be great. I had one of their new noodle salads and was so disappointed. there were about 4 noodles in the bottom of the bowl and the rest was lettuce. my friend had shrimp fried rice and that was disappointing as well. only about 4 shrimp. don't think i will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I went to this PW on Monday, December 26th, 2016, the day after Christmas. I ordered the pad thai with extra egg & two crab wontons, all to-go.

Shortly thereafter I went home to eat said food. I ate about half of the pad thai & both wontons. Immediately after, I felt a dull pain in my stomach. I figured I'd nap & sleep it away. 

The dull pain continued into the night, & into the early morning, except that it had upped the ante to include violent vomiting & forceful diarrhea. I spent the entire night & morning on the porcelain throne regretting my decision to eat PW that day. It is almost a full day later & I'm still not 100%. 

So will I be going back to this PW? After the hellacious food poisoning I experienced the answer is a resounding hell no."}
{"text":"So delicious! Try the ahi avocado salad, yum! Such a light, healthy salad but so filling! New favorite spot for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I can't say there is much on the menu here that isn't overpriced and cheap tasting \"food\". Now they are offering \"sushi\" which is laughable...extremely small and terrible. I wish this place would close down so a legit restaurant could take it's place."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff but food wasn't great (in fact, japanese teryaki chicken was super soggy....stomach is bubbling right now) and did not compare to Pei Wei's that I've been to. The menu here is very limited. I would suggest taking a chance on another place to eat at this airport."}
{"text":"I have been a customer here for years but the place is headed for the bottom.  My last time here I ordered online and it provided a food available time, I drove several miles to pick up and had to wait half an hour longer to get my food!  

The restaurant was out of chicken, out of soy sauce . . Who runs a restaurant this way?  The manager offered a partial refund, never got it, just a lie to make me happy.  

I got the food home and it was all wrong, they gave me someone else's hot / spicy food that was inedible, put my wontons and egg roll on top and jammed the food in my face.  

With this Pei Wei it's all about what they want to sell you, not what you want to buy.  That's why they are constantly changing the menu.  But they can't even deliver the food you order."}
{"text":"6:45 PM - So I ordered online, with the intent of picking it up a little takeout Pei Wei for my wife and some out-of-town friends before I take them to the airport. 

I got the email confirmation, but when I got to the restaurant I was told that there was some kind of computer snafu.  According to the young lady at the register, the manager had to restart the computer and apparently didn't receive some online orders. 

Even if you restart your computer, you still eventually get emails, so the explanation is a bit odd.  

I was told they would take my order now and that the food would be ready in about 15 minutes. Fine, it's easier than starting over someplace else, but I'd rather be with my friends in these last few hours before they fly home across the country. 

I got a pretty weak, afterthought sorry from her as she was taking the order.  She did offer me a copy if I would like a soda while waiting. Other than that no discount, no consideration. 

I'm sitting here now waiting patiently for my order. I'll be interested to see how this resolves. My rating is pending. 
.........
7:00 PM - I just got the food. I feel sorry for the young employee working the register. As a business owner myself I can tell that she obviously hasn't been trained properly how to handle situations that she can't change, but can make less inconvenient for the customer.  I can see the manager floating around, perhaps she hasn't been well trained either. At the moment there seems to be a lull with his workload, but it hasn't occurred to him to say anything to those of us who have had to patiently wait for orders. I wasn't the only one."}
{"text":"Fast food chinese food.  I guess it would be ok for lunch if you worked around here.  No atmosphere and I had an allergic reaction even though they sworn there was no MSG in thefood."}
{"text":"This is horrible Chinese or Asian good! Place is dirty and no staff to keep it clean. Pricy for what you get. There are much better places authentic, clean and priced better. China chili for one. I would NEVER recommend trying this"}
{"text":"Had take out today. We ordered lettuce wraps. They forget to put the sauce for the lettuce wrap. The lettuce wraps were so greasy. I have never had lettuce so greasy"}
{"text":"I ventured again to the the downtown side of I17.  I have been interested in trying a Pei Wei for quite some time but I thought it would be the one at 67th and 101 for dinner rather than this one for lunch.  Miserable traffic, cramped parking, I drove right by the place.  But none of that is the restaurants fault.

I got there at 1PM on a Friday figuring the lunch rush would be clearing.  As I walked up to the order desk I spotted 3 different 2 person tables to choose from.  By the time I got my order placed, no one in front of me, all three were being used and the only one open was next to one occupied by a one pretty woman just over 1/2 my age.  I left my number and went off to fill my iced tea glass and in that 2 minutes she was gone and the table was already cleared for the next guest.  Drat, scared off another one.:-(  Over the next 25 minutes that I was there the dining area did indeed clear out some but not as much as I expected.  Between the open kitchen, the music and all the talking I thought the noise level was pretty high.

My meal took about 10 minutes to arrive which I think is about right.  I ordered the limited time offering of Thai mango chicken with white rice ($7.75) and an iced tea (soft drink $1.75).  It actually looked like the picture on the web site.  Slightly spicy on the hot side (about what I expected) but more syrupy on the sweet side than I would like.  Chains seem to like syrupy.  The servers were quick to bring dishes out without letting them sit and were keeping the tables cleaned off.

Overall I think it is slightly nicer and slightly more expensive than Panda Express.  I wouldn't balk at going there again if that is what was suggested.  If in the right part of town I would prefer to go to Wok n Stix for about the same overall quality and price, and it is locally owned."}
{"text":"We loved Pei Wei until last night. Other locations are good, but this particular Pei Wei location always seems to have problems ranging from a sewage backup to being short staffed to giving tiny portions. These are things we've noticed in the past three years, each time making us vow to not return to this store. Being forgiving people, we gave them another chance last night. NEVER EVER AGAIN! 

When we arrived, there were only a few open tables and there was a long line--that was a positive sign. We were in line for About twenty minutes. When were ordering, we were told they were short-staffed...(red flag). My partner ordered the lettuce wraps and edamame. I had the honey seared chicken. I tried to order a soda, but was told the machine was broken. Fine; I had iced tea instead. The condiment station was a nasty mess and they were out of lemons and most everything else (red flag). We located three empty tables--all filthy, but hey they were busy and short staffed. While seated for a very long time, we observed the kitchen to be in chaos. My partner and I have both worked in the restaurant biz in the past and we could clearly see they were \"in the weeds\". 

When her appetizer finally arrived, my partner shared a few edamame with me while we waited for the entrees. She noticed that the bowl the edamame came in was filthy with old food. The edamame covered it up and it wasn't until she had gotten to the last few that she saw the trough our slop was served in. YUCK! 

When the waitress placed the honey seared chicken in front of me I asked her which was which and she didn't know. She then said \"they're busy back there and probably got them mixed up\". I let it go ( last time I ordered the regular to go and it was tiny--so tiny that once I opened the container at home and saw what they sold me, I actually weighed the chicken and called the store. I spoke with the manager at that time and was told the weight the chicken portion should be--mine was less than half. At that time, the manager voided my credit card transaction and assured me this was a one-time occurrence.) This time, the rest of the food was bland and the sauce on my chicken tasted different. 

When we got home, my partner had to sit down in the bathroom for over 45 minutes. She was awakened two more times in the night with the same problem. She awoke and felt nauseous and had a fever. After a couple of hours this morning, the symptoms began to subside. She seems to be on the mend now. 

I awoke this morning with nausea and a fever, which subsides around the same time as hers did. 

We will NEVER EVER EVER eat at this Pei Wei again, and are probably not going to visit any of their other locations for a very long time.  Cassie B., don't bother with the canned response; from the other reviews and your replies to them, fixing the problem is not high on the priority list. I won't take the time to go online and fill out your form; this review should suffice. That and the report I filed on iwaspoisonedDOTcom"}
{"text":"Omg this place is awesome to just get out of the house and have some Asian food (with the kids too!) In Arizona is almost always hot, but I looove coming here at night and sitting outside. The only thing that's bad is the parking, but there's not much they can do about it. The good thing is that people are always coming and going so just give it a min and something will pop up. But 80% of the time there's plenty of parking space in the evening. Definitely recommend this location to anyone in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They couldn't get my gift card to work and instead of apologizing and working with me, they just shrugged their shoulders and told me to use a credit card. I had forgotten my wallet, so I couldn't do that. I asked them if they could hold my order until I worked something out, but they didn't bother to respond. I moved to the side and called my husband to call it in and pay online. So he did. We waited for the take out there. Meanwhile 2 others try to use gift cards and it doesn't work either.  The whole time they ignored us. Finally, the time needed passed and I approached the counter to ask about our food, and they wouldn't make eye contact with me, talked amongst themselves, and flat out ignored me.  Then one of the girls tells the other. \"This Lady is driving me crazy\". So so rude! And the food wasn't that good either."}
{"text":"First time experiencing Pei Wei.  Found it to be overpriced and underwhelming.  Everything was just this side of overcooked, not particularly special, not particularly appetizing.  

Won't be returning."}
{"text":"As an ex-pat from Southern California, I consider Pei Wei to be a little bit of the home we left behind. As an offshoot of the PF Chang chain, it originated in the Phoenix area about a decade ago, and was in SoCal about eight years ago. It serves food quickly from a pan-Asian menu in the fast-casual style--stand in line to place your order and pay, then take your seat and the food is (usually) delivered in about 10 minutes.

I have the same thing every time: Kung Pao chicken on white rice. The vegetables are crisp, the chicken is plentiful and good, the serving is just the right size. That, a beer, and the chance to sit and relax a little while after eating, gives me a great night out after work.

Heartily recommended."}
{"text":"Long grain white rice?  Really?!  Why even bother then providing chopsticks?  The food was average, if you don't take into consideration the rice... the non-sticky, slightly undercooked, flavorless rice.  I had the Thai Dynamite with chicken.  It was okay, but again, the  rice takes everything away from the dish.  I should have opted for Panda Express across the street.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Food with very good. I ordered my meal and it came within a reasonable amount of time food was hot and very fresh.  If you come during lunch hour or  dinner hour there might be a line to get your food but that tells you that the restaurant is good.  If you order takeout call your order in and show up in 20 minutes it is always ready I don't understand these people walk in order takeout and then sit there waiting.  I usually order my food with no garlic and it always is cooked to order and taste good."}
{"text":"Had the small Orange Peel Steak w/white rice and Wasabi Crunch Roll (8). They both say \"spicy\" on the menu, but hit very low on the overall spicy scale. Our food was served hot, fresh, and very fast (full disclosure: the place was a little empty). My main entree was delicious! I ordered a small and it very satisfying. The rolls on the other hand were kinda weak. The \"crunch\" came from some substance sprinkled over the top of the rolls that resembled crystallized brown sugar in taste and texture. I love that they have a Coca-Cola freestyle fountain here. The cherry vanilla Dr. Pepper is great! I bought an appetizer to share, entree, and drink for just under $18. My friend just ordered a large entree w/water and his bill came in under $10. Worth the price for sure!"}
{"text":"So you're pretty sure you like Chinese food, But you don't care for the sometimes greasy, lukewarm fare at the average Panda Express.. You can't afford to have dinner at P.F. Chang's very often.. And you're not adventurous enough to try out the local mom and pop eateries.  What are you supposed to do?

Well, if this is you, there's a few options..
You can either settle, make more money, or get over your fears.

Luckily though, life doesn't have to be that difficult, and Pei Wei exists, making this dilemma a non-issue really.

This place offers the fast preparation of Panda, and the gourmet style of Chang's at a price most would consider reasonable. I'd definitely say it's fair for the food you get.

The food always comes out hot and fresh, made to order. The veggies are crisp and colorful, rich in flavor. I've never had any meat that wasn't tender.

I recommend the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. It's a juicy chicken, lightly fried and tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce.  It's sweet at first but has a nice little bite to it. Not hot by any stretch, but definitely has some spice.  

Thai dynamite is another similar spicy chicken dish I enjoy. I have a hard time deciding between these two.

I always order brown rice because A) it's healthier B)Pei Wei offers it .. and  C) they do it well.

For something a little more fun, though, I recommend their lo mein noodles.

Like all great Asian establishments, pei Wei has hot chili paste for your dining pleasure. This wonderful hot sauce is one of the few things on earth I consider to be pure and altogether good to the soul.  What sets Pei Wei apart is the fact that they have dozens of bowls of this stuff available for you to pick up at the bar to bring to your table. Just help yourself!! And don't mind if I do... I easily drain a whole bowl each time.

They have those nifty futuristic robot time machine drink dispensers with the screen that lets you invent any crazy flavored fountain drink you can think of.  That's cool and all, but I'm a tea drinker on most days. Pei Wei has an outstanding selection for folks like me. I recommend the Mandarin iced green tea. With a lemon wedge this stuff is so refreshing and satisfying to the taste buds. A perfect companion to the fresh food you'll likely receive.

This location is always immaculate, and my food is always delivered with a smile. 

If your hungry for some fast Asian food, don't overthink it.. Head on over to Pei Wei"}
{"text":"My wife urged me to give three stars rather than two, as she had a decent tofu stir fry. My daughter had a sweet-and-sour shrimp which seemed okay too. For me, I had the ahi avocado salad and the lettuce chicken cups. The chicken was fine, though not particularly remarkable. You can do better at Flo's at the Promenade down FLW a bit (or the Flo's at Thompson Peak). 

I had two issues with the place. First, the salad was drenched in dressing. The vinaigrette does a number on your stomach in such a large amount and it drowned out the taste of the other parts of the salad, most notably the ahi tuna. How nice it might have been had they not felt that the chard and other components needed to go for a salad dressing swim. When I was done forcing down the salad, there was enough dressing left to properly dress another salad.

Second, we were there on a not particularly warm Sunday night (at least for Scottsdale), yet the A/C was cranked up like it was the only thing standing between the patrons and a painful death by heat stroke. Maybe it had to do with the open kitchen - they wanted to keep the cooks comfortable at our expense - but it was a weird situation to walk in from temps outside in the 60s to Ice Station Zebra, with most people attempting to keep warm by wearing their outer jackets, sweatshirts, fleece, etc. (yeah, it wasn't that cold outside, but it is Arizona, where heat lamps on patios often are turned on when temps fall below 70). I would have sat nearer to the kitchen if I thought the heat emanating from the woks would keep me out of hypothermia.

Incidentally, this is not some chic restaurant where the open kitchen should impress us. I don't want to see how the proverbial sausage is made. It adds little to the equation, apart from perhaps reassuring us that they use food-based ingredients in the meals they prepare and are not throwing soylent green into a microwave. Rather, it adds to an already-unpleasant noise level and perhaps (see above) contributed to having us all be in the deep freeze.

I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is our normal go to place because of their $5 daily specials or what's email to me. And most of our office has some kind of preference to how their meal is cooked so when you order online you can select what to adjust. Sometimes it does get really packed during lunch but if you order online you can pick up or you can eat there really quick. Sometimes it does get a little bit slow to get your meal if you order and eat there."}
{"text":"I have tried different locations of Pei Wei, but I will just rate the Avondale one because that is the one I go to more often. It is OK, service is good. The favor of the food is either sweet, hot, or salty. I can not taste the different between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines. I know it is a chain, but maybe I am spoiled with all the different cuisines around the valley. We go because my husband likes it."}
{"text":"Met D there for lunch.  It was her pick today, she needed to get out of the office.  Wow, this place gets busy after 11:30am.  Get here or stand around looking for a table.  CRAZY!  

The food is you know \"Americanized\" Chinese food, so it is OK.  I got the usual honey sheared chicken with brown rice.  It is a little sweeter than I remembered.  Or it could be old age kicking in?  The green ice tea was good.  

All in all, OK."}
{"text":"I'm not saying Pei Wei is the best asian food I've ever tasted, far from it, it's a fairly large chain that puts on the appearance of something more refined, it's essentially to Asian food what Olive Garden is to Italian Food.

With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name \"panda express\" (which is overpriced crap)

the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home, I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)

I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially \"un-F$@k's\" your food and returns it to you.

Overall great customer service, consistent food, and a good option for takeout in surprise."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service. We choose to eat here when deciding to eat out. Clean bathrooms and a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Restaurant was a little dirty. It was hard to find a table because many of the tables had not been cleaned off. Where was the manager? They should not allow this to happen. Food came out quick which was a pro. It's just hard to eat when birds are munching off of dirty plates. I had decided to eat on the patio because of the beautiful weather.  Kung Pao chicken is my favorite dish here. Do not get the  chow mein , it was not that good. Plus you hardly get any chicken. Only one of the soda machines had Coca Cola available."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is an Asian inspired chain owned by PF Changs but at a lower price point (~$7). I really liked the large vertical panel screens on the way from the door to the register. These screens show the different options on the menu: salads, noodle and rice bowls, signature dishes, etc. 

I ordered the new Thai chicken wrap and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad. The Thai Chicken wrap was very disappointing. The chicken tasted like fish!! That really threw me off, and the flavors did not taste Thai at all. I couldn't eat more than two lettuce wraps before the fish taste made me want to gag. 

BUT the spicy chicken that came with the salad was pretty good for cheap American imitation of Chinese flavors. The salad itself was also really refreshing. The only issue I had with it was that there was way too much spicy chicken sauce that covered the salad. Next time, I'd ask for less sauce. 

Overall, the experience was to be expected for Americanfied Chinese food. However, I probably will just stick to authentic Chinese food for around the same price.

{"text":"Went in for a Sunday afternoon lunch about 1 PM. The place was about a third full so no wait time at all. It must've taken 20 minutes to get our food and half of the food came out cold. What's wrong with this picture? A mostly empty restaurant with late food and cold food.  And customer shouldn't be treated like this .....get your act together Pei Wei.  You are a national company that should have much higher standards across the board"}
{"text":"We normally love Pei Wei but yesterday when we went we ordered our normal order of chicken fried rice and pot stickers. When we got our fried rice there was a hair at least 4\" long weaves through the rice. So disgusting, I took the plate over to a server standing next to the manager and tried to get the managers' attention (he ignored me) so I pulled the hair out of the rice and showed the the server. She took the plate from me not saying a word and followed me back to our table to pick up the bowl and took it back to the kitchen. I had to ask her a few minutes later if they were remaking it an she nodded yes. The manager never came over to our table and seemed to hide in the back until his shift ended. 
One of our favorite restaurants and we will not be visiting for awhile!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed today the food was not up to my expectations.  I had shrimp not expecting it to be deep fried, the food didn't have much flavor, it was supposed to be spicy, but was not, but was very greasy.  This is the first bad experience I've had at Pei Wei, but I will not be back, at least at this location."}
{"text":"It's Pei Wei. If you know what to order it will be decent. Not a fan of the sushi but their rice bowls and wraps are super good.

This location is clean with an abundance of parking."}
{"text":"Have always been a big fan of pei Wei till recently. Today they gave me the wrong order and when I returned to have it corrected, Jessica, the manager tried to tell me that it wasn't  until I showed her the receipt and she rushed to correct it. As well as my husband just pulled a 6 inch strand of plastic wrap out of his fried rice it's safe to say I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The food is good maybe 4 stars for the fast casual, but the service is 1.  Order Staff, is not at all friendly, hurried, and makes a lot of mistakes.  Overall the employees morale  seems not to care.  Last time I was in, waiting for take out, I saw two orders served wrong!   On a typical day it come take over 20 mins without any line.  Maybe if ur lucky you get your order under 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I been to many pei Wei restraunts in az. This one is the worst. I order different things all the time, but love the salads. Normally they bring a good side salad for the amount you pay for. This place brought me a small salad and my husband a small salad with maybe three bites of chicken. We both ordered different salads and we both were not satisfied. Never again. I love pei Wei but not when I get riped off for what I pay for."}
{"text":"Tried this location 3 times. Will not go back.  Long wait with an empty restaurant. It was so dirty I had to wipe everything down with a napkin and hot water. I was going to use the hot mustard and hot Chile, both dispensers where crusty dirty and clogged shut."}
{"text":"watched tables of people get their money back. The wait was ridiculous especially for people on their lunch hour. I attached a copy of my receipt, we ordered at 1:06. Received food at 1:45. IWatched my food get delivered to another table and then the delivery person went back and picked it up, took it back up to the kitchen and then grabbed the other meal that went with mine and brought it over to me, pretty disturbing"}
{"text":"The corporate decision to change to the Caramel Chicken was not a good one. Cabbage on top is not appealing in taste or appearance!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the low reviews for Pei Wei.  I, frankly, like the food here and I love how they will customize your meal if you tell them to add or delete certain ingredients. And I've never had any problems getting my food in a timely manner.
By chance, I discovered their edamame is out of this world!  It's sautéed in sea salt and ginger and extremely tasty.  I've tried to remake this at home but haven't quite gotten the flavor as good as theirs yet.
The fact that this location is consistently busy attests to their philosophy of good food, quick, at reasonable prices.
I also like how they try to change out their menus so that it's not the same items month after month, year after year.
I've always loved their concept every since they opened and I hope they continue to thrive here and elsewhere in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"First time customer. Ordered noodle & rice bowl with tofu and vegetables, received a bowl with chicken. Brought it back they quickly replaced it. However, they forgot sesame seeds. Brought it back and while getting my sesame seeds, they cleared off my table;great! Went back for new silverware and water glass, started eating, all noodles....I give up!"}
{"text":"After being a customer of 2 years at this location I pretty much had it. The manager By the name of Ryan was very disrespectful and rude. I had gotten extra steak in my meal and was charged for it. Upon receiving the meal I see that it was less steak and just topped off with rice. I explained my case to the \"manager\" and he denied it and said \"if I wasn't happy, I can go to the other side of phoenix and have low quality food\". I didn't even receive my money back for something I didn't get and I left the store upset. I will be doing a follow up on this matter and I will never step foot into this place again."}
{"text":"If you ask me? I thought this was awful and the cashier was a unfriendly. The caramel chicken was ok but the brown rice did not taste done to me..overall it's a nice comfortable setting."}
{"text":"The food quality is hot and cold, sometimes it's great sometimes mediocre.  It seems to be best eating in.  The soda machine is the coke product machine where you have 85000 choices so that's nice.  They have updated the menu sizing and offering some new items.  My biggest pet peeve there is often you receive your appetizer and entree at the same time.  For 2 people it could look like 2 pigs at a trough lol.  They are getting better at it though.  Best place for Kung Pao"}
{"text":"Pei Wei No Way

The price is cheaper than P.F Chang for sure.
But the amount is so small, just enough for my Yorkie.
The meat is dry; no sauce. Hot & Sour soup is more like Hot & Salty soup. 

Because I've never been to other Pei Wei,
this 2 stars rating is only for Guadapupe location Diner Select dishes.
the price range for their Dinner Select is $6.25 to $7,
 you can get same price & better taste even at many other Chinese Buffet,
like Hunan 8 in Mesa (Gilber/60),lunch & dinner same price exclude Sunday,
 or Yummy Buffet in Chandler for lunch (Alma/Walner).
or Lin's buffet, $8 lunch, you can get salmon; deep fry shrimp.

I do agree it is cleaner & not as noisy as most of Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"After expressing my concerns via email to the corporate offices, and additional email exchanges, I received a sincere apology from John Conde in the Guest Relations Department (7676 E Pinnacle Peak Road, Scottsdale AZ 85255  P:  480.888.3000) along with 'Be Our Guest' cards in the amount of $30 to be used on a future visit.  I have enjoyed Pei Wei over the years and will continue to be a customer; however, just not at this particular location (742 E Glendale Ave)."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is the cheaper and in my opinion, more delicious, sibling to PF Chang's. They have a very similar menu, but the entrees are about half as much. I am personally a big fan of the crab wontons. They are crisp and have the right amount of filling - which cannot be said of many restaurants. If you sign up for the rewards program, they are great about sending you coupons. This time, we used a 40% off on all entrees. Awesome deal!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you have to order more than one thing. I finished my entire meal before my fiancé's tacos were brought to our table. After sitting at the counter for more than 15 minutes, the busboy tried to deliver the tacos to 2 different tables before finally figuring out where they belonged. Skip the Test Kitchen and go to a proper Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I've always loved Pei Wei and never had any complaints. This past visit was the worst I have ever had. As I'm typing this, it's been over 45 mins and I still haven't received my food. I get it, restaurants get busy and what not, but you don't let guests wait this long for something as simple as a rice bowl. If there is back up, you let your guests know. It's absolutely ridiculous that even when I brought it to one of the employees attention, they didn't even offer an apology. If I'm going to spend a little under $20 for a one person meal, I better be getting the type of service that matches the price tag I just paid. Also, my food just came and it's semi cold. 


WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Never returning."}
{"text":"What's all the fuss?  I'm not sure what folks compare this chain too? The Dead Duck Inn?  Joe's local Chinese Gag house? Are those places that great? Sooo fresh and delicious!? Not in my days? Pre-made sitting around and HEAVY oil is what I see from most other establishments. Even those touted by friends. Maybe it's because they know George from behind the counter.  It's not Pei Wei! Pei Wei is a quick, fresh and inexpensive gift from heaven. Even the hard to please Yelper has to admit, the multiple options you have to modify your meal should give you no excuse not to love what you order. The food is fresh and prepared to order. Even fried rice is made to order. The sauces are made from scratch and are a combination of quality Chinese ingredients. (Chili paste, fresh garlic, scallions, bean curd, and a bounty of fresh Chinese vegetables).  Go Yon China will serve you pre-made sauces with no punch and lots of giggle. The atmosphere at Pei Wei is great! Black and dark red with glossy graphics and all sorts of Chinese! Even with the \"stand in line\" style of dining. Makes me hungry just thinkin' about the joint. However, to me it's a take out Ferrari! Call in, swipe my card and off I go. Sure, it's not Chang's. Still, it's better than the local Dead Duck Inn's \"food\" stained art, with a Chinese New Year paper place mat. 

Of course! I'm looking at the healthier options a Chinese food place may have to offer, and Pei Wei lifts the bar in multiple sets! Get your chicken steamed, go brown rice, add extra vegetables or go vegetarian. Still you may complain...\"Oh, is it too salty? Or too sweet?\" Give me a break. This is CHINESE FOOD! And, you won't find MSG. So, if you don't want spicy, salty or sweet; have a meal from Bland of the Rising Sun. But, if you want a highly under rated treat...I ask you to open your mind to this familiar spot for clean, fresh, made to order and \"if you like\" healthy Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Food was good, this would be the reason they are still open. This place needs a clean down from top to bottom.  The bathrooms disgusting, tables sticky, seats, chairs, floors dirty. Our server basically slammed the food in front us us with out a word. You think for at lest $10 an hour he could be polite and happy to have a job."}
{"text":"My shrimp and vegetables were good; the rice was not. I see a few reviews mentioned panda - at least they know how to cook rice. In fact, even uncle Ben's is better rice. Hint : you have to add water to cook it. Can't say I'll be back, at least to this location."}
{"text":"Shameful, I haven't been back here since the remodel. & I will not come back again. If I wanted to go to a Panda Express I would have went to a Panda Express. it is a Friday night at 9 o'clock and this restaurant is empty. we used to come here all the time and it was always packed. shame on Pei Wei for changing the format to a fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"Decided to dine in after our power went out and we were waiting on APS.  Ordered the Dynamite Shrimp with fried rice and a 4 piece spicy tuna sushi roll.  After I quickly figured out the electronic pop machine I chose my seat and waited for my order.  

The place was busy thanks to the popular take-out counter.  There were a couple of tables available and plenty on the patio for dine in.  

My entree came before the sushi which I thought was odd for some reason.  I received an overly generous portion of fried rice, plenty for lunch the next day.  I should have ordered the optional small plate.  My shrimp were well prepared and the vegetables good.  

My sushi was good despite low expectations."}
{"text":"Pei Wei what happened? I haven't been to a Pei Wei since all of the menu changes. My favorite used to be the Spicy Korean and now, it's not even close to the same. It's now a sweet/spicy instead of savory/spicy and it lacks ALL of the great veggies it used to have. I miss the carrots, mushrooms and pea pods that were replaced with bean sprouts scallions, and red bell pepper. Rice was also lower quality and improperly cooked. Impossible to eat with chop sticks because it wasn't remotely sticky. As for the new addition of sushi? Please stick to what you used to do well. I took a chance despite a bad sushi experience at PFChangs. Pei Wei's sushi was clearly pre made and refrigerated or possibly frozen ten thawed as the rice was hard and cold and crumbled when picked up. The only happy person of the four of us was the 6 year old that ate plain noodles. The rest of us were very disappointed and won't be back unless Pei Wei goes back to quality over cost savings."}
{"text":"Every time I have ordered from them I received excellent service and the food is just as awesome. I usually order on the app and pick it up on my way home or my lunch break. The one time i had an issue because i tried to use an app coupon but had ordered a special (i didn't know the orange chicken was a promotion item but it was) the cashier handled my disappointment with the best service! Always clean, huge portions(the small is more than enough) and food is fresh! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I don't know how the folks at Pei Wei prepare their tofu, but it's just the right texture--sort of seared on the outside and tender on the inside. The sauce is a bit much, but the vegetables are well-prepared, as is the rice. The orange tea is delicious, as well. For this vegan, it's a good, quick meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a good number of times. This is a great place if you're in the mood for Chinese food. Everything is delicious, I think I've tried almost everything on the menu at least once. The interior is always clean, service is always quick, and the sound of the chefs behind the counter make the place very lively and busy-feeling. It's always crowded for lunch, take what you may from that fact. 

I only wish there there was a bit more variety to some of the dishes, because choosing from their menu is like making a sandwich. There's always going to be some kind of meat with rice or noodles, it just basically depends on the type of meat you choose."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a decent Chinese restaurant in Arrowhead. I am always disappointed at the long waits and sometimes there are flies. I once waited almost 45 minutes for take out. Come on.. One should never wait more than ten minutes for Chinese. Other than that.. Food is good and the portion sizes are big."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! 

Customer service the worst!! Tried to order online and got all the way through the order to find out the online ordering is down. So I call first time I'm on hold for 10 minutes. Frustrated I hang up and call again. No answer for another ten minutes. It has now become a challenge to see if I can get through. I literally call up, put on hold again drive to the location wait in line order my food. Get my food drive home and yes I'm still on hold!! 38 minutes later they finally answered the damn phone!! 
If there was a location within 5 miles of this one I would never spend another dime here! 
Manager needs to get a handle on this issue. This happens almost every time we try to order for pick up at this location."}
{"text":"Two stars for the food being good. Service and time waiting for the food is always horrible. We will try a place a few times, but after today we are done. The issues with getting food out in a timely manner and staff communication are never going to get better. Don't waste your time and money on the over priced small portions of food."}
{"text":"The food is great but for several weeks they have only had one register open and the digital menus don't work.  The wait has gotten ridiculous.  I'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pei Wei use to be somewhat of a fun good experience. They seem to have become the subway of Chinese now. The food is chewy. Sauces are never proportionate. The rice is dry.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"Ahi Avocado Salad was really good. Came with tempura crispy thingys on the side which was super yummy poured on top of the salad. Wasabi dressing  was just right. They also gave me their sriracha aioli sauce for the spicy tuna roll I ordered and I added that to the salad which pushed it over the top. So good. Sushi was fresh made to order. I ordered take out upon arrival and waited less than 10 mins for them to whip up my order. Every employee there was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there. Very clean restaurant. Good food. Great service. Easy location for quick in and out. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had the Korean Lettuce Wraps and an Asian Chicken Salad on 06/02. The lettuce wraps were good but the Asian Chicken Salad had a long hair in it. I sent it back and another salad was given to me without dressing. I thought I was imagining things so I had my friend taste it. He agreed there was no dressing. I got a refund and went to Paradise Bakery down the street. I really like Pei Wei but I will never go back to this location. It seems like they just don't care."}
{"text":"Long lines, running out of menu items, and bus boys finger combing their hair and then handling clean plates. I won't come back here or to another Pei Wei again. The manager upfront was dismissive and not happy to answer any questions. They ran out of sodas there for a while. The kitchen staff were hanging out chillin while the To-go line was outrageous. There were dirty silverware in their containers and it took several tries to find forks without rice or noodles still in them. 

Suggestion: don't come here."}
{"text":"Mongolian beef pork egg rolls shrimp pad Thai my regular order allways fresh tasty hot food staff is always pleasant"}
{"text":"I've called trying to make a to go order on two different days with no responses. The phone rang over and over. I'd hang up and try again several times with still no response. Finally after giving up and going in the clerk laughed and only said \"yea im not sure where the other girl went\" I'm not sure if it's an issue of being under staffed or if the people they do have on just don't care. But I'm currently waiting for an order they said would be ready 15 minutes ago! I suppose I should avoid Pie Wei all together when on a timed lunch."}
{"text":"As usual the food at this location is not bad a solid three out of five stars. However, what really bothers me, is that they always make errors when making the to go orders. Last time they forgot the salad dressing for my salad. This time they forgot to include brown rice with the chicken and instead included white rice. This occurred even after I went through the order item by item with the gentleman who bagged it up for me. What keeps me coming back, is the food is usually tasty fresh and well-made. We ended up ordering the children's chicken rice combo. The chicken was a little bit too large for my children about the size of a golf ball. We also ordered Asian chopped chicken salad. While tasty and fresh, the chicken was not shredded completely, and it and was essentially a few large chunks that were poorly torn apart. Finally, we had the cream cheese lobster rolls which were tasty as usual.The spice level I would consider mild to very mild. What keeps me coming back to this location? The staff is very friendly, there's usually plenty of seating, and the tables are always kept clean. I will probably return as I have done in the past five years multiple times."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pei Wei but may stop going to this location. Over the weekend my wife and I placed an order over the phone while at the grocery store. We arrived to Pei Wei at the time our order was supposed to be ready. My wife stayed in the car as it was a hot day and we had some refrigerated groceries we just purchased. When I went inside to pickup my order, one of the items was missing. The person helping me was the store manager and I told him what I had ordered originally (15 minutes ago). He never apologized but said he could have the extra dish ready in \"2 minutes\". I hesitated but he gave me a guarantee it would be 5 minutes at the most. Time starts to go by and in the past whenever I have had to wait, Pei Wei usually offers me a drink, since nobody offered, I decided to purchase one. I am waiting and waiting while people come and go, in the mean time my wife is still outside in the car with our refrigerated groceries that have been out much longer than expected. Fifteen minutes go by and my extra dish is finally ready. The rest of my order had been sitting out on the counter the entire time I was waiting. By the time I got home 2/3 of my order was no longer fresh and warm as it had been sitting out for 20 minutes, not what I expect for a $30 lunch. I will most likely start going to one of the other locations in the area."}
{"text":"Pei Wei sure has gone downhill over the years. What was once a trendy, fast-casual restaurant is now a worn-down, dirty, shadow of its former self. I came right at 5pm before the rush, and the place was dirty. Food all over the seats, tables sticky, and restrooms that reminded me of the truck stops during road trips to Iowa (go Hawkeyes!). When my food arrived, I found that they forgot to add the spice, but instead of taking care of adding spice, they brought me a bottle and told me to do it myself. The food itself was pretty good, but the uncleanliness was a deterrent. The couple a few tables away had wine glasses that were so dirty that I could see the grunge from my table. He went to resolve the issue, but wasn't helped. When their food was delivered, the runner said she would bring him a new glass to pour his wine into, but he'd have none of that. Pei Wei, your food is generally good, but it's time to clean up your act."}
{"text":"BEST hot and sour soup! The spicy tuna roll always somehow ends up in my order also. The fried rice bowl is good, chicken low Mein. The chicken lettuce wrap, spring rolls, crab wontons and chicken pad Thai. Never disappointed, I eat here once a week. I love it."}
{"text":"I love pei wei. I eat at one of the locations around the valley at least once a week. They have the best Orange Chicken ever. The Crab Puffs are great and if you like something spicy then get the Blazzin Noodles or the Thi Dynamite. The Lo Mein Bowl is delicious as well. I would rather go here than many other asian restaurants in town really.  All dishes can be prepaired with chicken, beef, or shrimp then choose white rice, brown , or you can get fried rice. I have been here many times and never had a bad meal. The prices are great and the amount of food you get is good. They have a few apps including lettuce wraps, edamame, crab puffs, dumplings and other great things.  They also serve bottled beer."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. What a mistake! We live in the area, but haven't eaten here for almost year. The food was horrible. We had Honey Seared Chicken & Mongolian Beef. The Honey Seared Chicken was over cooked and tough. The beef dish had strips of beef folded over, and once cut into was totally raw inside. I mean raw and uncooked. The worst part was going to the restroom. The smell of rotting food was overpowering. I looked into the kitchen as I walked toward the bathroom and saw food all over the floor of the kitchen. The smell was so gross...I almost barfed."}
{"text":"First time experience at Pei Wei: Nicer interior than expected; simple ordering procedure (choose base, protein, carb, etc. then pay, they bring it to your table); and food was served hot (except uncooked large mushrooms). 

Downsides: The food (both mine and my husband's) was extremely sweet- and shouldn't have been for what we ordered. Also, the ladies restrooms were in need of more frequent cleaning and I'll leave that there to be polite. 

Overall, pretty good food if you like sweet meats and sauces."}
{"text":"We love going here.  We love the friendly, quick service and quality meals. Dillon, the manager, is really good. He is friendly and helpful with suggestions.  

Food is delicious and has good variety from Sushi to Chicken & Noodle/Rice bowls.  It's kind of a midway point between Panda Express and P. F. Chang's.  You also earn loyalty program points.

Ambiance is fun. We like sitting at the counter to watch the food get prepared.  It's one of our favorite 'go to' places."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Called to place an order and the girl that answered made it seem as if I was inconveniencing her. I started the order by ordering pot stickers and was told that these are no longer sold at this store. That is all I needed to hear and called another place."}
{"text":"This place is exactly like PF Changs but with counter service instead of table service. You get pretty amazing food for your money and the portions are sizable too. The ice tea here is to die for! When I was working in Vegas I went here 2-3 times a week. The food and the service are always consistently good. Don't be afraid to try something new, if you don't like it, they are more than happy to replace it"}
{"text":"The food here was ok, maybe just a touch better than Panda Express or similar fare, but not great. I guess if you're looking a slightly fresher alternative to Panda Express, this would be it."}
{"text":"This was my first and likely the last time I ever go the Pei Wei!. The one staff member taking and bagging to go orders was quick to take my order, (Orange chix & Teriyaki... Chix only) Then I got to stand and wait for 20 minutes. I watched one order sitting on the counter (no heat lamps) and when the customer who had placed the order/paid on line came in she was told they were still waiting on part of the order. Food came out erratically, items for one order and then items for 2 different orders. (none of which were complete of course)  When I finally got my order, the other customer was still waiting on the online order item???  Food isn't bad, but the service/efficiency sucks! It's hit/miss at best and slower than water running up hill.
 \"IF\" you're going to go there anyway, have a LOT of time & patience!! also don't bother to order ahead, it won't be ready when you get there!"}
{"text":"Used to be a go-to restaurant.  Bottom line:  Served eggroll still frozen in center.  Employee's comment was \"Ya....\"  She could not have been more disinterested in customer service.  There was no manager in sight, and it did not appear anyone over 22 year old running the place or cooking.  The restaurant was filthy.  I used to love the chicken chow mien.   The chicken used to be wok seared with flavor.  Now, the chicken is torn stringy strips of plain white meat chicken that tasted baked, with no wok sear or flavor.  The noodles had no garlic, ginger, soy or anything on them.  There was one piece of onion.  This was probably the worst Chinese dish I ever have been served.  They did replace my frozen pork egg roll with a hot one, but is tasted old and spoiled.  Both me and my friend felt sick after our meals.  What a disappointment. I went to a Scottsdale location a couple of moths ago and the food was OK."}
{"text":"I don't go to Pei Wei a lot but when I do I'm normally very happy with my food.

I went a few days before Christmas with a couple friends for a quick dinner. I got their dinner deal for $6.25 and I must say for the price the amount of food that you receive is excellent.

My only criticism is that it took awhile for us to receive our food. We were probably the only people sitting outside at the time and my friend and I both watched as one of their staff walked back and forth inside the dining room with our food. It's like he forgot that there was outside seating at the restaurant. He had to go to the back and have someone else show him where the patio was. Regardless, we received our food and it was still super hot and delicious. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I remember when I loved Pei Wei. It's been a while. I couldn't remember why I stopped  going there for lunch or dinner. Now I know. The menu changed, the food is greasy"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night. Pei Wei food is pretty standard across the board. What makes this a 5 star review is the service we received.  We were a party of six and ordered a lot of food.  When we sat down the manager, Sarah, came over and told me that they were out of the sushi we ordered, so they were going to refund it and offered an appetizer in return and they gave us free lettuce wraps.  After we got a lot of our food, I realized, our potstickers were missing. I looked at my receipt and didn't see them on there so I went up fully prepared to pay for them.  They told me they had it and brought them out shortly, and didn't charge me.  Then about 15 minutes into our meal, they came out with the sushi we had ordered and told me \"we just got some new California rolls made, so we wanted to spoil you with the sushi you wanted.\"  I am very impressed with the level of service and attentiveness we received. 

I will continue to frequent this Pei Wei when the urge for Asian food hits me :)"}
{"text":"Will not be back. The 3 items ordered were very weak.
Spicy Tuna Sushi was cold pre made and below grocery
store quality. Had pork egg rolls that were swimming the oil they were fried in. The Chinese Chicken Chopped Salad full of soggy chicken and
lettuce, over dressed with a lackluster dressing."}
{"text":"I used to live in California and visit Pei Wei next to my house at least twice a week, and have always been a fan.  High quality, fresh tasting, and flavorful, I think that Pei Wei is a cut above most other greasy quick service Asian food restaurants.  You can't beat the price, and the service in the restaurant was very good.  I ordered the thai coconut curry chicken noodle bowl, and it was very good and very spicy, but I do think that I prefer the regular entrees that come with a side of rice.  Maybe I just didn't enjoy their noodles, and next time I may order the same thing but substitute rice instead of the noodles.  Also, the pork egg rolls are always amazing and extremely juicy and flavorful.  I tried the new chicken wings, which had excellent flavor but were extremely small and probably only worth $3 though they were priced at $7.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive. My man - V is not a fan of onions and they came to the table to double check the order. He ordered the teriyaki with no scallions but did not mention that he would also like no onions. They were kind enough to ask about the onions since he said no scallions.  Good thing because I love onions and would have been good with less. 

After we received our meal he wanted some more teriyaki sauce. They were nice enough to bring it out shortly after it was requested. 

Overall experience was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ok let's start out with complete honesty.. I had no intentions of dining at Pei Wei's Asian diner. I was realllly in the mood for Chipotle but..  walking inside the place was like running head first into a mashpit of teenaged kids and people everywhere.
    I hate lines....but honestly who doesn't 

So on to Pei Wei, As I walked in I was slightly confused. Nobody was there to great you or really inform you what to do. Luckily bright menus and and well places signs easily show you the yellow brick road to the dine in desk!
Once I figured out that chicken lo mein was on the menu it was no question... And who am I to say no to a side of chicken egg rolls! My bill was about $10 which is solid in my opinion for a dinner with a side!
My egg rolls came out 1st, the mustard was good but I like my mine very spicy so I immediately asked for some chile paste  and all was right in the world! The egg rolls had a great crunch and almost tasted like the Thai dish Pia thai (spelling don't judge me on on my phone) I loved them! For these alone I would toss out 4 stars !!!
Then my lo mien chicken came out shorty after and wow! The array of mushrooms and the chicken cooked to perfection was simply amazing!  It had such A great taste and texture I had no choice but to finish it all! 
Over all I will be going back to Pei Wei's the egg rolls were amazing and It will be hard to try something new because bothe my orders were great!"}
{"text":"I have seen a commercial for Pei Wei quite a few times and the food looks so fresh & inviting that I had to try it. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken without rice & wanted to substitute with veggies. Apparently you need to pay for the substitution 99¢ is not a big deal, however tonight it was because I barely got any veggies (4 pieces of broccoli, about 10 snow peas, shredded carrots & carrot rounds ?) & there was only about 5 small pieces of chicken. So disappointing about portion but the sauce was amazing. Just wish I had gotten more :("}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving this chain location a good review, especially after displacing Emerald Lounge and Wings n Things.

That said.... it's down the block from my house, it's tasty and fresh, better than a couple local neighborhood non-chain places, and it's relatively healthy and fast. A good mix."}
{"text":"Really a downgrade from the original Pei Wei diner.  The food menu was changed way too much and the kitchen is much less flexible on what they are willing to do. Unfortunately I think everyone has caught on since the lunch hour seems to be pretty empty.. Unlike before when you had to wait forever to order AND get a seat.  Hopefully they'll change it back.."}
{"text":"My first bad experience at a Pei Wei location. From the moment we walked in, it started off bad. We stood at the register for a good while before the cashier even approached us. When we walked up, she saw us, no smile, no \"be with you in one moment\", nothing. Then someone came in through the side door for pick up orders and she quickly assisted him. Once he was gone, she went make to labeling to-go boxes. We just stood there, and honestly should have left. When she finally approached, no \"sorry for the wait\". We placed our order and went to grab our drinks. The soda dispenser was splattered with hot sauce and the touch screen was very dirty. Greasy dirty. When our lettuce wrap appetizer arrived, we got no plates.  Stood near counter to ask for plates for a bit until i noticed a small stack. Just had to help myself, i guess. Hubby ordered the Pad Thai. Was 90% noodles. No joke. The sauce dispensers were not appropriate for the sauce. The openings to all were clogged with the chunky sauce. Forgot to mention that the place was not full. Not even half full. We usually love Pei Wei and were really looking forward to this. Huge let down. Avoid this locating of you can."}
{"text":"I need to update the review because the people at Pei Wei responded to my letter and they were understanding and completely professional.  The food and prior experience haven't changed, but the manner in which it was handled has completely redeemed the business in my opinion."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, tasty what more can you ask for? Just avoid the Korean Chicken IMO worst thing on menu full of good stuff."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times.  But recently they developed a rewards program.  The girl at the counter talked me into joining while I was there on my last visit.  I spent way more time signing up for this standing at the counter with others waiting to put their orders in.  I was enticed by getting a 500 point bonus when it only takes 1000 for a free dish.  Well this never happened, my account is still \"0\".  So not only did I not get the 500 point bonus but I didn't even get credit for the meal my wife and I ordered that night.  No problem right?  I will just send an email to customer service through their website as they request.  Again I spent way more time to send a notice through their website than I wanted to.  Now, after not even given the courtesy of a return email from their so called customer service, I feel it best to spend my time telling the public what a horrible taste Pei Wei has left in my mouth.  There must be 25 oriental restaurants within a 15 mile radius of where I live that are just as good or better than Pei Wei.  With the lack of respect they have shown me I will visit the others from now on and let Pei Wei be a distant memory of a bad experience.  Don't waste the time to sign up the only thing you will get from Pei Wei is junk emails.  Cuz we don't get enough of them on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Yummy place! I had the Japanese Chilly Ramen bowl. It was very tasty and had a nice spicy flavor to it.  We also ordered the new wings. They were also tasty but very small. There were 6 to an order and just didn't seem like enough. A little disappointed with the wings but very happy with the ramen bowl. I'll pass on the wings next time.  Give it a try I would definitely recommend this yummy lil spot."}
{"text":"Omg only one cashier to take orders & assemble to go orders. Lines for both. Poor girl. Food is great though. The wait sucks."}
{"text":"unfinished dinner, by choice.  money not wisely spent. 

I am not a big fan of franchised or chain restaurants, and it's been a long while since I stepped foot on one of them, especially the ones that claim to be \"authentic exotic so and so cuisine\".  For me, they're all Americanized and bastardized cheap versions of the originals.  This is my first time at Pei Wei's. 

True enough, looks can be deceiving.  The interior and set up will make you feel you're dining at a fine or upscale Chinese gastro venue.  I went in, stopped by the cashier and ordered my food.  The food came and after the first bite, I realized the exact damn reason why I've never been to and tried Pei Wei's before. 

The soup was uber peppery hot and ultra vinegary sour, and texturally and un-appetizingly slimy.  There were few chunks of tofu, occasional ground meat, few strands of bamboo shoots all mixed up in what seemed to be originally egg drop soup but colored with dark soy sauce.  There was not a taste or even a hint of the earthiness of either straw or rat's ears' mushrooms.  Out of the whole bowl, I consumed half a cup.  Bleh!

The Mongolian Chicken Dinner was a disappointment,...at best! It came with a serving of brown rice.   It tasted more like a Sweet and Sour Chicken sans red food coloring, pineapple and red/yellow peppers. In place of the peppers and pineapple chunks were quartered button mushroom and scallions simply cut in half, and again possibly colored by dark soy sauce.   The sauce was watery and the chicken meat's texture was suspiciously weird.  It didn't taste like chicken at all. It was silky soft and didn't need chewing and felt like it melted in my mouth.  It actually made me wonder if it was chicken.  Scary thought!

Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Twice they forgot lettuce for the LETTUCE wraps. This time I asked to make sure not to forget the lettuce and they forgot the sauce and gave me the wrong sushi. Not to mention the staff looks like they hate all the customers and could care less about their job or actually being polite. After I told them this time of the twice wrong orders she didn't even reply just handed my receipt and told me my food wasn't ready. I'd rather drive out of the way to other locations where they actually seem like they want my money."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Pei Wei in years. Was happily surprised at the vegetarian selection and options! Service was great and friendly. Don't let a long line deter you. They move you through so fast and get you your food steaming hot!"}
{"text":"Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants (I know that sounds lame for a chain, but it's ALWAYS great quality and hot/fresh)."}
{"text":"This is like a fast food PF Changs.  I think it's a bit pricey for what it is.  I ask for them to go light on the sauce as I think they sometimes drown their meals in sauce.  In a pinch, this place is ok."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good meal, keep looking. The food here is very bland. The hot and sour soup was so salty and it wasn't hot; it was also like a bad tasting gel. The person who took order didn't know the ingredients of some of the dishes. If you want see how bad this place is, hurry in before they go out of business."}
{"text":"This particular location is pretty busy most of the time.  It is located within a shopping complex that in itself is busy regularly as well.  We stopped here for dinner before seeing a movie in the area, and although there was a line, it moved pretty quickly.

I had the Mongolian Beef - which is my typical order when we come here.  We also tried out the pot stickers, which were not as good as the ones at PF Changs.  Probably wouldn't order those again, but the spring rolls are a good substitute. The beef was cooked well and we enjoyed the extra sauce the server brought over to us.

Overall: B+
Busy location, but with friendly staff and pretty quick food service it's not a bad stop off."}
{"text":"First time eating here because the rating on the prices were said to be different than Panda Express. They seem to be about the same price when you order your drink and additional sides. It may be a bit more. 

My interaction with the cashier was very pleasant. She was very helpful helping me decide on what to order. I was on a budget trying to decide what to get and I'm surprised she did not give me any attitude with the remarks I made about the constant changes I made trying to deal with my price range.

The service seemed to be okay. The manager seemed to be bringing everyone there meals. I had a question about the types of chili to have with my meal so I see one of the guys in the black uniforms who I noticed delivered some of the food out to the guests.

I look over at him and he notices me staring. I was hoping he would come up to me and help me out with finding some siracha because with Pei Wei being an asian restaurant I was hoping they would have some. He then turns away from me so I have to walk all the way to the counter to ask him if they had any. He answers my question very rudely and turned away.

It made me feel pretty stupid asking a question like that but then again it made me quite angry. I walked away and did nothing about it. 

Every person interacting with a guest should be willing to help them out with any questions they have. If it weren't for the helpful cashier I would have given a one star rating.

Food was actually really good as well."}
{"text":"Sadly I don't have much positive to say about this place.

First Expierence: I walked in the door and was a bit confused as to where to order. Do I bypass the rail in the middle of the floor? Oh wait, there's the menu on the wall to the side. I only noticed it because I saw the to go menu first and I was reaching for that. I guess he was the Manager? He wasn't wearing all black like the others, he waited for a few minutes but I had NO CLUE what to order so I just let him wait by staying back from the counter. He didn't say anthing to me, just stood there than finally went to clean or something. When I finally decided on Dan Dan Noodles (from a review here) and 2 pork egg rolls. I felt like a robot might have been more personal than the Manager who took my order. I didn't even get a Hi. Just: For here or to go?

I got a water with my meal and it was a seperate machine. I'm saying this because it took a few minutes for my meal to arrive, and by that time I had one lonely ice in my cup. The water isn't just room temp - it was closer to warm! I filled my cup half way with ice. WTH?

The young man who brought my food was the only nice thing about the place. He smiled, told me my egg rolls will just be a minute and left.

The Food. Minced chicken basically means ground chicken. For some reason it doesn't look appetizing. On the menu it had a little red flame next to the name of the dish indicating Spicy. It barely was! Is their spicy just pepper?? Wheres the heat?! Half way through my meal I realized what the dish tasted like. A plain version of the turkey spaghetti I made a couple weeks ago. Only mine was better and it had tomato taste to it. I pushed the bowl away so disappointed. If you saw me sitting there you saw me shake my head every few minutes because it was just...blah!

I was a bit excited about the pork egg rolls, the hot mustard it was served with was a bit odd but okay, I'll try it. The first egg roll was pretty good - I've had better - the hot mustard sauce was okay. The second egg roll after about 5 minutes it was sitting in grease, I wrapped it in my napkin to sop up the grease but saw the puddle under it and said nevermind. Pushed that away.

When I only eat half the meal, and NOT take the rest home - speaks volume. When I pushed the egg roll plate away, it bumped into the bowl and realized it was PLASTIC. LoL - I thought they were nice bowls but the \"clink\" of them bumping I realized they look similar to the dishes you find at the dollar store.

In all, my $11.02 didn't seem worth the meal I recieved. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pei Wei's a weak midfielder in quality and experience. They are lucky for the 3rd STAR. 

I tend to get take out, because I don't like eating on premises. It mostly boils down to insider knowledge. But also, I don't care for this style of restaurant: where you walk up to a cashier, order, pay, get a number and wait for someone to deliver the food to your table. What don't I like? I don't like the tip line on bill. Tipping prior to service makes no sense to me. If you think differently, you are likely someone that thinks the world owes you something. And we just disagree there. The fact that a friend of mine's daughter worked at this location and frequently talked about what jerks people were for not tipping on take out orders gives me concern about a resentful service staff. Resentful servers give me the willies. Anyway, I love recognizing a job well done with a generous tip. I just can't read the freakin' future. OK OK, I know it's not just this place. The situation is rampant, stupid, and fraught with consumer guilt and anxiety.

ANYWAY! Sorry for the rant. We tend to get take out.

Darcie and I like the Spicy Chicken Salad and the Lettuce Wraps. Word to the wise for take out: For lettuce wraps you'll want to ask for a new set of lettuce cups... not the ones in cling-wrap they prepped in the morning. Those will absolutely be brown on the edges and somewhat wilted. No lie, every single time. Believe it or not they have become annoyed by my request for new lettuce cups. In return annoyance, on one instance, I asked for the lettuce cups from my To-Go bag and showed them the brown wilted lettuce. I expressed how furious I have been in the past when I have discovered that exact same poor quality on arrival at my home. They gave me new Lettuce cups.

Also, I don't like the fried rice here. Bland flavorless. 

Your mileage may vary... except for the Lettuce Cups thing. 100% solid advice there."}
{"text":"I like going to Pei Wei when I'm craving Asian cuisine, but I always stick to the same order because every time I try other items, I'm disappointed. Here's my order:

Crab won tons
Chicken chow mein 
Chicken lettuce wraps


If I stick with these three items, I'm good. The taste of the food is consistent and service is never bad. You just order at the counter and they drop it off to you."}
{"text":"What exactly is an asian diner?  I think thats some kind of oxy moron if you ask me... my new arizona pal and natalie g recomended this place to me on our business trip.  I was surprised that a chain like this could have halfway decent food.  I probably wouldnt eat here again by choice but it wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"My fave dish is the chicken lettuce wraps, but you can't really go wrong with ordering anything here. They are efficient, good and inexpensive. I ordered the wraps, shrimp chow mein and crab won tons to go. I wasn't in the restaurant very long as I ordered there even though it was lunch hour and there was a line that moved fast. The food was delicious. Hubby and I ate everything."}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour chicken with white rice. Also a pork veggie egg roll. And crab wontons. The chicken, veggies and rice were good. But BUT the sweet and sour sauce was NOT sweet and sour. Disappointed. The crab wontons didn't have enough cream cheese and crab flavor. The roll was.... too much.... pork. Everything would have tasted better with better sweet and sour sauce. I will come back to try something else though. Different sauce. Lol"}
{"text":"This location has the best food & service of any Pei Wei in Vegas, IMHO.  Great job on the cooking & seasoning, I prefer it to PF Chang's actually.  The best Kung Pao chicken I've ever had anywhere.  It's a smaller dining room and is always clean and the young man, Steven, who brings you the food is attentive. Very courteous staff and one of my fav places for Asian."}
{"text":"Just grabbed a Togo order from this pei Wei, defiantly the best one I've been too. The building is an old brick spot, located below Side Bar and sharing a wall with Starbucks (heaven on earth perhaps?). Legit city style complete with exposed wood ceiling beams and brick walls. The sode machine is intense though, user be warned. 1 spout, 100+ choice, all touch screen! this aint for your grand pappy!!! Great, fast and friendly service. Line moves quick. Togo has their own door/cashier. Only problem is parking. I come here for Starbucks sometimes and every-time vow never to come back due to parking. Maybe I just need a longer fuse? On second thought, Nope. Improve parking please.  Thanks. 4 stars only due to parking being such a pain."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to grab something quick and yummy.  I am a new fan of the Chicken fried rice with extra veggies. I love that I can customize my order to get it exactly the way I like it. It's a generous portion and very good.  I also love the classic Chicken Lettuce Cups. This location is clean and appears to be doing a good business. Sometimes the counter staff are on the young and inexperienced side, but overall, I think this is a great option for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Usually love Pei Wei but typically order \"to go\" vs. eating in the restaurant. 

This evening I met my wife for dinner and was terribly disappointed. 

Arrived at 540pm to a line out the door. Waited almost 25 minutes just to place my order. Turns out they only had one young man taking orders. 

Went to get a drink and silverware to find no knives or spoons, no lids for the cups and no plates. (Keep in mind that the dining room was only 1/3 full as everyone was stuck in line to order)

The food came fairly quickly but not very tasty. Edamame came out Luke warm at best. Lettuce wraps are no longer served with round lettuce but triangles. Honey seared chicken was very different tasting than in the past and not in a better way.  Chicken quality has moved more to a Panda Express model vs. PF Chang's. Rubbery. 

No need to go back anytime soon. 

One good thing - we saw a few friends there as well and enjoyed catching up."}
{"text":"First of all, I love Pei Wei.....but I hate this location. Went there 3 times, had a bad experience each time. Today (4th attempt) I tried calling to place my order over the phone because I know they take forever..... I was on hold for solid 15-20 minutes. Hung up and called again.....still nothing. Hung up and went to in-n-out across the street. I repeat again, I love Pei Wei. But this location sucks. I usually go to the one on Bell & 3rd street (excellent customer service) so I was all excited about this new location but so far it has been a disaster each time I went. I hope they do something and fix this right away. 
Update: just went there again....and I threw half of it away. This time my chicken was so undercooked I was afraid to eat it. It actually tasted rubbery and chewy. Needless to say, I'm done with this location. They failed all 5 times that I went there. That's it for me."}
{"text":"Terrible food and experience.  Waited over 25 mins for frozen lettuce wraps, I was using a fork to put the chicken into the lettuce and a large chunk fell off my fork, I split it open and it was ice cold, because they are frozen, NOT FRESH.  
We ordered Mongolian beef, Mongolian -x-chix no rice and honey seared on white, pretty easy stuff.  The Mongolian came out just chicken on a plate.  The manager was not wearing a name tag, giving people there money back because it was taking so long, he could not control the employees, who by the way were drinking out of uncovered cups, yelling at each other....
I could go on an on but.....save your time and money go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I have ordered the Pei Wei Spicy Shrimp Salad from this location and other locations for years. It is usually prepared with Napa/Oriental cabbage. Today it had zero cabbage and was replaced with iceberg lettuce. YUCK!  Ice berg lettuce?!  This will be my last visit here. This place used to serve really good food but their service and food is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Last night, we decided to use their BOGO offer to try the new Asian Chopped Chicken Salad Bowl.  It was an absolutely stunning RIPOFF!  It appeared to be almost entirely generic iceberg lettuce, with a few traces of shredded red pepper and carrot...and almost NO DISCERNIBLE CHICKEN!!  Other items from their description that were apparently missing: Thai basil, \"heritage greens\", scallions, crisp won tons, sesame seeds...we literally got NONE of those items.  And I'll say it again because it deserves emphasis: we got almost NO DISCERNIBLE CHICKEN!!  At $7.99, these are priced about $7 too high.  I doubt that I'll ever go back to Pei Wei...even their regular menu is basically for people who've never been to a real Chinese restaurant...very sad!"}
{"text":"Have been eating hear for a long time today will probably be the last time. It was absolutely terrible. I ordered sesame chicken on quinoa, asked for the chicken to be steamed, and to be a bit spicy. 
When i received my I was as told nothing about edamame and carrots in the quinoa first of all, and the chicken was breaded and not steamed like I asked. So they took it back and redid it. I get the meal back and I don't even know where to begin, it was extremely bland, the veggies that was suppose to be with the chicken (scallions, red peppers and onions) were about 4, maybe 5 of each, the sauce was so much it was like soup, and normally rice would be on the side but this had the quinoa all over the bottom of the plate and the chicken on top. I didn't want edamame or carrots in my quinoa or meal and wasn't told about it. I ate about half the chicken and that was about the only thing edible. This place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"It was easy to order ahead online, and the food was ready when I got there, which was nice. The food is average/ok, but like another reviewer said... if you're looking for authentic Asian food, you already screwed up, lol.
The first employee, a teen male, was aloof and didn't even greet me. A minute or two later, a second employee, another teen male, was helpful and friendly. Maybe things balance out?"}
{"text":"I been here few times for dine in however my recent visit was take out. I called in to order our food for lunch and she was very pleasant and helpful on the phone. She even told me that it would cost me extra $2 to get what I ordered which I didn't mind however I like the fact that she told me upfront. 

Fifteen minutes later I drove in and my food was ready to go. All I did was waited for one person ahead of me for about a min then I paid my bill and my bag was ready to go :)

As I stated earlier, I been here few times and we have enjoyed our visit every single time. This place is always neat and clean. Customer service is great, what I really like is the fact that you pay for food when you order and they bring your food to the table so you can just walk out when you are done. You don't have to wait for waiter to come by for check and then wait again until they bring your receipt so that you can sign and get done with it. 

One thing I would recommend is that ask lot of question when you order about their different sauce and how they taste, that way you get the type of food you desire and you leave with happy ending."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and good eats.  A bit on the noisy side but the fresh food makes up for it.  Love the Pad Thai, all the diner select meals, & lettuce wraps.  Consistent in the their taste and freshness."}
{"text":"Brandi oversees the To Go orders and catering. SHE IS FANTASTIC. Any restaurant is lucky to have someone so dedicated to customer service and promptness. I will continue to order catering from this Pei Wei just because I know she always gets it right and is on top of customer service. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT FOR TAKE OUT AND LARGE CATERING ORDERS TO GO."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I always order take out on their  website and the food is always perfect. The crab wontons are fav's as is the Kung poa chicken."}
{"text":"The time that these restaurants are open are in accurate and yelp should change that to reflect the correct open to close times. Went there this evening just before closing, according to yelp, 9:30 but the actual time is 9:00 pm. Once inside I was waiting behind another person and the cashier was just laughing and talking to them for almost 8 mins. Once I get to the register he asked me if I was there to pick up and I said no I needed to place an order. That was when he told me \" umm sorry we are closed\" I replied no because I've been standing here for the last 10 mins and referenced the yelp listing hours. 

There was another person that was behind me and she too was upset at the fact he was taking his sweet time and trying to turn the both of us away. 

After everything I was able to place more order and left satisfied.  I just feel the staff could have handled things a little better and it would seem there needs to be a change to their hourly listing on Yelp."}
{"text":"Food and service are okay. My boyfriend had never been to pei Wei before and I remember that the last time I had it, years ago, it was great...I guess it's just not what it used to be..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to think anymore.  Of course I quit going altogether when they tried that lame pei wei market format that almost put them out of business. 
Have been back since they switched back though. 
Somehow the food doesn't seem as good. 
Today was really strange though.  I ordered at the counter and then after I paid, the woman asked me if I wanted my change. Granted, it was only about 9 cents or so,  but it struck me as odd. I've never been asked that before.  9 cents is hardly a big deal but I hope this isn't going to become a trend. Wouldn't. Like.  That."}
{"text":"not bad. i like that you can order online and set up the time you want to pick up your food. i had the thai coconut curry and pot stickers. the food was good. obviously its not the most authentic but do you really expect authentic at a place like this? not really. all in all i'm a fan. i'll be back."}
{"text":"My son tried \"sushi\" here for the first time! Very cool they had it on the menu.
My kid goes with honey seared chickenso yummy.
I typically stick to pad Thai or Kung pao chicken. Edemame's and lettuce wraps are to die for.
Casual ambiance but nice:)"}
{"text":"This use to be a nice place. This trip the service was very bad and a cockroach ran across my wife's shoulders. The manager came over and killed it.  Employees were dirty. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Have you ever been mad at a restaurant because it's so good? Well, this is where I'm at with Pei Wei. I generally abhor all chain restaurants and prefer to go the road less traveled when it comes to eating out. However, due to my love for Pei Wei I never get to try any new Asian places. Yea sure, I think about it. I want to, but I just can't.  

So in closing: Pei Wei I love you like an old comfortable sweater. And I hate you because that sweater never did look that great on me."}
{"text":"Way too crowded for lunch but they seem to hire very attentive staff so I give this place at least 3 stars. Nice building, nice food but just too crowded, I don't know how it got so famous but apparently it did. 
Another restaurant is needed on this corner to make some more competition."}
{"text":"Pei Wei locations are popping up all over the valley. 
They are cheap, fast and good. 
Typical pick 2 or 3 entres as you move along the line place. 
The room is brightly lit and large posters of food make you want to eat more."}
{"text":"I pretty much don't care for any location of Pei Wei, but I'm reviewing this one as my office occassionally orders from this location. 
I don't totally loathe Pei Wei (hence the two stars), but if I had a choice to eat there I wouldn't. Anytime I have gotten chicken lettuce wraps from here they are always very greasy. 
Their wonton soup is pretty much broth with a couple of wontons. 
The blazing noodles are ok, but are a bit too spicy for me. 

The worst thing about this location is their teeny tiny parking lot. You can rarely ever find a parking space here. You can park around the corner in the neighborhood or across the street at the antique shop. If you plan to eat here on your lunch break from work good luck to you. You're better off getting take out. This place is so packed during the week for lunch you could probably spend your entire lunch hour and more waiting."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience EVER, and I wish there was a zero star option!! I ordered 4 orders of lettuce wraps (lettuce wraps) online for takeout. I ordered online on purpose since it's a Friday night and they'd be swamped. I arrive to check in and the girl takes my name and says they'd be right up. 25 minutes later I check in again and she says they're next, so I go back into my phone, now keep in mind that there are about 8-10 orders just sitting on the table behind her stacking up. Another 29 minutes go by and I go up to the counter again and tell her I've been waiting for almost an hour now and I didn't even arrive until the suggested time in my confirmation email told me too. She scoffs at me, rolls her eyes, and asked me my name again, then proceeds to look at all of the orders behind her on the table that have not been touched in \"FOREVER\" and grabs my food that is now cold pushes it on the counter towards me, and turns around and walks away! She might as well have given me the finger!!  My family and I love Pei Wei, and I don't even know if I want to come back here again."}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming here in a few years. The inside decor is modern and clean. I got the Thai dynamite with tofu and vegetables and my girlfriend got the lettuce wrap entree with a side of rice bowl of rice, it came to $16 (awesome). When we got the food were pleasantly surprised to see the portion sizes were enough to be full and have leftovers to take home. The food itself was awesome, the sauce was unlike anything I've had anywhere else and it wasn't overly spicy. They have Chai tea on tap and the new touch screen soda machines if that's your thing. The service was also very good. Overall there was nothing to complain about. Very satisfied and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is one of our favorite lunchtime spots. My coworkers and I were forlorn when this location was closed for about a week for renovations, but alas, we were delighted when it reopened last week. It was a bit of a puzzle trying to figure out exactly what had changed within the restaurant because nearly everything looked pretty much the same. Maybe it got a little brighter inside?? The good news is that the menu is still the same, and the service is still great. 

What I like a lot about this location is that the servers will help you hold a table if they see that you're waiting in line as a group. I only wish that I could get this kind of service at other quick service restaurants! Heck, I can't even remember how many times I've been left hanging with my tray in my hands and nowhere to sit at In-n-Out Burger. My coworkers and I have never had any problems waiting or getting a table together at Pei Wei even when it's super busy, which is much appreciated. 

The food is typical Asian fare, but with a deluxe restaurant twist--after all, the place is owned by P. F. Changs. I prefer coming to Pei Wei over going to Panda Express or other quick service Asian restaurants because I can easily customize my order. Each meal (that I know of) is individually prepared, so you can ask to hold certain ingredients from your chosen dishes. The Mandarin Kung Pao chicken is my favorite, and even though I hold the onion and garlic, it's still super flavorful. The portions are pretty big, so when I practice some self control, I'm able to turn my meal into lunch and dinner at home. 

Overall, Pei Wei's awesome for great service and customizable food options, so I recommend it as a relatively yummy and painless lunch break from work."}
{"text":"Drive up to Pei Wei tonight for dinner and the restaurant was closed at 7:45pm tonight.  Yelp still showed the restaurant as opened. There were a lot of cars parking and having to go somewhere else. A sad day for PEI WEI. Hopefully everything is a go tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love the food here but its getting harder and harder to find a parking spot. They share a small parking lot with starbucks and a place upstairs called The Side Bar. I highly recommend you never go here after 5pm if you want dinner because you will NEVER find a parking spot. I would suggest going to one of their other locations in the valley."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is the Asian version of Chipotle, Quick, reasonably priced, delicious food. This is one of my go-to restaurants when I eat out and now they have sushi which is fresh and not bad at all."}
{"text":"It was our first experience at this chain and will be our last.  We only went there in the first place because we were real hungry and had limited choices in this shopping center.  Nothing came close to tasting anything like Chinese food. It's just gross.  We can't figure out why so many of these places exist and why anyone would want to eat at one."}
{"text":"This location tends to be inconsistent in how the food is prepared. We, frustratingly, have both good and not so good experiences here and this review is obviously in response to a not so good experience. We feel like we don't want to go back to this one, especially, because of the inconsistency. But when the food is done right and is not bland, as it was last night, we are def up to return. Last night my wife's Kung Pao steak was undercooked and slimy so she sent it back only to get a marginally better serving, still a disappointment. My Mongolian Steak was done with the meat but it was boring--barely sweet, no spice, just ho hum which is unlike how I've had twice before. I def sent Pei Wei feedback on their site for such information. My wife goes here often with former co-workers and has little confidence in this location and sometimes just chooses not to eat with them. :(
[And the parking lot is terrible]"}
{"text":"My experience was pretty good here the other day.  I took my family here after a long day of work and errands.  It's not a restaurant in the fact it's a condensed version of P.F Chang's China Bistro.  So what that means is you self serve drinks or can do a takeout order to go.  Menu is much smaller, but a large variety of soft drinks in the multi-option soda dispenser.

After we ordered our meal, it took a long time, almost twenty minutes.  One of my pet peeves in life is I need it yesterday and live on the edge of tomorrow.  I don't have time to screw around wasting life for service.  I'm one of those guys who will pay extra to expedite that service, because time is money.  This is the main reason my review was not a 5 star.

When our meals finally did arrive, the rice was shockingly undercooked where it was still hard when you would chew it.  That about set me over the edge, as all of the food brought out had the same issue!  That tells me the kitchen was mismanaged and no due dilligence was done by the chef.  Fortunately, I didn't go mafioso and demand a refund or any of that low bottom feeder boatratness that some Yelpers thrive on.  I politely asked the server to remake it and it was back out to us correctly remade within a few minutes.  Faster than the original order!  A hungry man only wants his food to shut up and eat in solitude.

After I finally was purring like a kitten, the delicassey of my shrimp fried rice made me crave more...I still was not satisfied, so I ordered more!  You know the old saying, Chinese food gives you large quantities and never makes you full?  Untrue on this visit, food was so great I had two helpings and washed it down with some iced crushed Dr. Pepper.  It's not that cheap ice crap either, it's those little morsel type ice cubes that crunch in your mouth easy while in enjoying a nice soft drink.  Most restaurants cut corners there, but Pei Wei did not.  For a fast food establishment everything was top notch except for the initial waiting and cloggage of people in my way to place an order.  Will bookmark this and definitely come back - I'm a forgiving soul when it comes to great food!"}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the restaurant itself or its service as I was not there. I have been in a funk because I have been trying to eat healthier and as nothing healthy has sounded good I have been a grouch and turning my nose up at everything. My husband out of the blue just decide to try this Pei Wei place. I am glad he did. He brought me home some Gluten Free Vietnamese Rolls. They are soooo good. If for some reason these are not somewhat on the healthy side, please don't tell me. Even if I wasn't trying to eat healthier I would still order these. My husband had the Pad Thai with chicken. He said it was some of the best he has ever had. I am sure that we will order from there again..."}
{"text":"I decided to try Pei Wei after having not eaten there for a couple years since their menu never seemed very healthy.  They recently changed some of their options so I ordered a few takeout dishes for my family, all steamed chicken or shrimp. They tasted ok, but what really spoiled the experience was my wife's Chinese chopped chicken salad. About 3/4 through the meal she stopped eating, disgusted by the insect among her salad which was still ALIVE.  I contacted the manager (Cory or Cody, I believe) and he only offered a quick apology and to make us a different dish if we drove back to the restaurant. I told him we were too far away and he should check the rest of their salad for similar insects (see the pictures I included with this review). He didn't seem too concerned. Furthermore, my voicemail messages to Pei Wei corporate customer relations have not been returned. This Pei Wei location is definitely a lower tier, fast food version of PF Chang's.  I'd avoid it and go to Panda Express nearby instead. At least there you can see what goes on your plate before you eat it."}
{"text":"I love the beef n broccoli, service has always been good, ate there many times and will go back!
Staff is very helpful 
They also give a veterans discount :)"}
{"text":"4/29/2018 - Pei Wei, come on man... 

The last two times I have been here THE AIR CONDITIONING WAS BROKEN and the place was a mess with a number of unbused, dirty tables?

Both front doors were propped open (PROBABLE HEALTH VIOLATION?) and yet they were still serving food?

Can't imagine the miserable conditions having to be endured by the kitchen staff?

Not sure if I will be going back as this situation brings into question the rest of the facility, equipment and cleanliness?

FOOD - was okay but the service was extremely slow..."}
{"text":"I eat here one a week. Personally, I have only ordered the Ginger chicken and Mongolian beef. Every time I invite my family there dish and they order something else its not that good .If you go there only order those two things!"}
{"text":"You'll get the right meal if you dine-in. Making to-go orders, the girls working gets them mixed up or gives orders to the wrong customers. I ordered a to-go noodle dish with no onions and scallions. I get there at 630pm on 9/2; 20 mins since I ordered online. There were 2 cooks standing there talking and 2 girls manning the registers. There were no customers in line so I thought that my food was ready. It wasn't ready...or they must've given it to someone else because there were no to-go orders set aside. The girls starting looking through the orders and asked the 2 guys to make my order. When I got home, it was a chicken lettuce wrap WITH ONIONS and SCALLIONS. Not even the right order!"}
{"text":"Ugh wanted this to be delicious but was disappointed. Placed an online order tonight at 8:54pm with pickup ready by 9:06. Waited until 9:26 for my 1 item to be ready. Food wasnt good or fresh. Seems i received a small size (not even half full)  when i ordered a regular size-see attached pictures. Waste of money and 32 minutes of my life"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pei Wei. My son had chicken chow main with mango  California roll and he said it was ok but the rice tasted funny. My daughter had the orange chicken and teriyaki crunch roll. She said the roll was good but the orange chicken was not. I tasted it and it was off. The rice tasted funny a really bad after taste, the chicken didn't have much flavor. We saw the commercial with the tiger and Panda. Panda Express orange chicken it way better. I had the steak and shrimp noodles and wasabi crunch roll. Oh boy! First I asked for spicy and the staff members told me no! Because it was spicy and I replied I would like more spice and again I got a no! The 4 pieces of shrimp were breaded and stuck together the picture of the meal doesn't show breaded shrimp. The noodles were dry and no sauce or spice. The steak was good. Now the roll, how can a sushi roll be salty?! Yup it was salty very salty. I also noticed waiting for my take out order as people left the tables were not wiped down there was many tables that were dirty. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Twice I have gotten honey seared shrimp to-go and 3 of the \"shrimp\" was nothing but batter. The first time I contacted the manager and was invited to come in and have a free meal, I obliged, and it was delicious. But the next week, same thing happened. Plus the shrimp that were shrimp were mostly batter too. There was also a lot of food debris on the outside of my food containers, which was not very appetizing. Please get your shit together Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was friendly. Floors and plates were a bit dirty. But I was pleased with my visit. I love the floor plan and the outside seating options."}
{"text":"For a short stint while I was in college, I was a food runner for PF Chang's in the Bay Area so I became pretty familiar with their ingredients. 

It says something then, when Pei Wei (which is quite a bit more affordable) uses the same ingredients. It seems like they take a little less time with presentation or garnishes and just do the bulk of the meal and have someone run like hell to get it out to you. 

The staff is good but seem overstretched at times. On one occassion, I had gone to get a refill and my girlfriend had stepped away from the table for one reason or another as well and they threw away our food, which was about half finished. I mentioned it to the busboy and within minutes they had fired full to-go orders of both (since obviously we'd have some left over) and the manager was at the table apologizing. In the end, it was impressive.

Last thing, I'm a simple guy, and one of my standby's is the Honey Seared Chicken. If you aren't starving, you can get a good sized chicken and rice dish by ordering the Kids portion and it's only $3.45. It's a total steal and they never ask if I have a kid in the car or anything. Abusive? Maybe. Effective? Totally."}
{"text":"I eat here fairly often , and the biggest issue I was having was the Togo food would have juice or a mess of sauce soaking in the bottom of the rice bowl. So I started coming in to eat , and they make my order incorrectly just about every other time. So tonight , my bowl was made incorrectly again , just wanted it replaced. Then when it was sent out correctly, there was a hair under the rice almost stuck to the plate. So I just can't with with this place, just be careful if you do decide to eat here ."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Attempted to call in an order and sat on hold for over 4 minutes. I decided to hang up and just place the order when I arrived. Upon arrival, there was no line and the dining room wasn't busy. (Not sure why they didn't answer the phone). I approached the counter and started to place my order with a young lady whom didn't smile once during our entire exchange. Not a thank you in site. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Happy to have another Asian restaurant to eat at aside from Panda Express and they have sushi! I ordered to go and the food was ready as soon as I walked in. I like that they have a loyalty program as well. I recommend the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Great food. I love how they are expanding their menu to become more vertical in the different Asian cuisines. 
Great service as well!"}
{"text":"I've always loved the delicious honey seared chicken at Pei Wei. This place was a perfect pei wei meal they cooked the chicken just right as well as brought it out in an orderly amount of time.I would definitely recommend this Pei Wei to any one in the are! Four Stars!!"}
{"text":"It's not bad, its not great.    I've ate here 3 or 4 times trying to get a feel for this place.    I got the chicken pad Thai twice, and the Mongolian once.   It's uh.... ok.   

As far as Pad Thai goes, it just lacked flavor.    I've had better.   the noodles were over cooked and the chicken was not great.    

I've kinda avoided this place when it shows up on the work delivery menu."}
{"text":"*** Gave them another chance yesterday...lettuce for lettuce wraps was still so small you cant WRAP anything! DId enjoy the Spicy Chicken salad....even though they still put the scallions on it when I requested none....guess I need to learn to cook at home! LOL! :)  Will still go there coz I do love their food!!!"}
{"text":"This Pei Wei is located in the Dana Park retail shopping complex. The restaurant thus has ample parking, and a well-kept exterior. The outer patio is also nice.

The inside of the restaurant is clean, stocked and not too loud. I always appreciate the ability to order online, and they have a separate pick up area for take-out. This is great, because we all know that I hate feeling awkward, waiting in the regular line, taking up real estate. The gal that took our dine-in order was efficient and to the point. Friendly, but not in an annoying way.

J ordered shrimp pad Thai. Young Master L ordered honey-seared chicken with white rice. I decided to try the chicken lettuce wraps, and a 2-piece crab wonton. We waited a good while, like 20 minutes, for the food. This is ok, because at least they're making it fresh. However, the timing of service was disappointing. My wontons came out. Then my lettuce wraps right after. Now, I told them this was my meal. But it was another 5-10 before L's order came out, and another 5 until J's came. Poor timing. 

J liked his pad Thai. It is nothing special, and not spicy or anything to write home about. L loves the honey-seared chicken. Then again, he is a dude who loves cheeseburgers, fries and chicken nuggets, ketchup and ranch. Now, Pei Wei is never my first choice. I like authenticity and flavor. This food, to me, is very Jok (white, flavorless Thai porridge). The lettuce was clean and cool, cut just big enough. The chicken was flavorless. The sauce given with it was a thin, watery, almost vinegary soy sauce. Now, if it had been Hoisin, maybe. Runny liquids on folded lettuce just makes a mess. The wonton/Rangoon were ok. Crispy and hot. Crab was invisible. I didn't like the sweet chili sauce. They laid in a bed of it. It tasted chemically processed. Pass.

The guys had soda. I had chai tea. The tea was black. I wish they had cream for it, but oh well. The tea itself was watered down and tasteless. Almost like someone added a ton of ice to the receptacle to cool it enough for the beverage station. The tea was still hot, so I'm guessing that it consumed all the ice and became a watery grave of its former robust self? 

While Pei Wei is ok for some, thia is not my cup of tea. Literally and figuratively. It's not horrible, but it's not good. Service is moderate. Do with it what you will."}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding like a snob, I was pretty annoyed with the ostentatious \"exotic\" atmosphere of the place. 

I suppose being spoiled with Asian food while growing up in San Francisco, I am totally biased. Pei Wei's food is edible, just nothing compared to the Asian cuisine you can get elsewhere (even in Chandler) that is tastier and less expensive. 

For what this is, I would rather go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Not surprised by their bad reviews. Food is actually pretty good but when you call in the phones keep saying someone will \"be right with you.\" However, you can walk in the empty restaurant and see the cashiers just standing around chatting. 

When you ask if their phones are working, they say actually they are not working and haven't worked for a while. \"We are not taking call in orders.\"

When asked if their phones don't work why they don't have a message stating as such so people don't have to keep staying on hold, they said they didn't know. Obviously not The cashiers issue but Pei Wei is big enough to have management that could handle such a problem. 

Good luck PW."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered Pei Wei through the our delivery app. My husband got the lettuce wraps (you really can't go wrong with those) and I ordered the steak Pad Thai with just a touch of spicy. It was DELICIOUS. My Pad Thai was a little spicer than I thought it would be but I can handle spice. It was delicious. I am always craving it! Favorite place!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Great atmosphere and good portions. I'm so glad there is one up north now in the rain tree/101 shopping center hell."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about writing this review because I was going to give a lower rating.   I was so hungry after spending 3.5 hours volunteering at the aid station for the Viva Bike Vegas 2012 ride that I could have eaten a take out menu and thought it was good.

This was my first time here and I had researched Yelp reviews and their online menu.  I ordered from the take out window one order of chicken lettuce wraps and a large hot and sour soup.  The lettuce wraps were very good.  I am a salt lover, but the sauce made the wraps salty even for me.  But, I still enjoyed them.

The hot and sour soup had a rich taste but I'm not used to having ground meat in hot and sour soup.  It's generally small slices of pork.  The texture was a bit of a turn off and I didn't think the soup was that spicy.

My biggest issue was service.  I realize I was a walk in at 4:30 on a Saturday evening.  There were four people in the restaurant at the time.  There were some take out orders to be made but there was never less than three cooks working behind the counter and before I got my meal, there were 5 total.  I probably waited 15 minutes.  I saw the one cook pick up and handful of rice sticks and toss it into the take out box--no gloves, no tongs--just bare hands.  Also, the soup was ladled into the take out container and just left on the metal shelf for 10 minutes while the other things were being prepared.

When the counter critter brought my bag, she apologized for the long wait.  I watched this place as it was being built and never stopped.  That's been about 10 years.  I guess I can wait again before I return.  The lettuce wraps saved the rating from being 2 stars."}
{"text":"So I don't get the lousy reviews.  My wife and I have been eating here for years and it is always first rate.  We always get brown rice and extra meat on our entrees and that way we have a meal for the next night.  Also we are both big fans of their hot and sour soup.  We usually order 6 large, split 1 and freeze the rest.  That way if we have a quick sandwiches for dinner we can have them with hot and sour soap!  Yummmmmm."}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei but I was super disappointed that they only had 5 gluten free options. I got the sweet and sour chicken and it was really good. 

PF Changs has such an extensive GF menu that it is really surprising that Pei Wei hasn't followed in their foot steps."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  I go in to order the kung pao shrimp roll and paid when three minutes later the cashier tells me that they ran out.  Really, who runs out of food?  Good luck when you order next time, you may just end up with just rice!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Pei Wei many times. This was the first time it's been awful.  Dry, not made to order, no flavor at all.  I don't like to post negative reviews but holy cow, this was not good today."}
{"text":"Per Wei is always hit or miss depending on location...This one is a miss and been so consistently for quite some time.  I try it again every now and them in hopes they have hit but no luck yet!"}
{"text":"I called from to car to place my regular order. 25 minutes later , still on hold I walked into the restaurant informed the cashier and all he said to me was \"I am extremely busy\" ...still on hold I walked out and hung up.  Looks like I am in the market for a new take out place, and yes the manager will be hearing from me. Including the pic of the mostly empty restaurant."}
{"text":"I had SEVEN bugs in my lettuce wraps last time I ate here. Some squished and dead. Some still crawling around happy. I called the manager and he did not seem that concerned... Just busy so he comped my order. Later I learned they do not cover their trash cans in the back which is why bugs are flying around stored food. Now I don't even want their ice in my drink. Who knows how dirty everything else is behind closed doors."}
{"text":"Very disappointing this time as well.   I have given this store a few chances and the food is a disappointment every time. The Pei Wei spicy chicken was nothing but small shreds of chicken and balls of batter. I used to love it when it was chunks of chicken.  Now for he past year or so-  every time it's shreds of thin sliced chicken and an over abundance of batter. Not a fan anymore.   This locations food has gone downhill."}
{"text":"After a long day of work and I can't seem to get myself to make dinner, I like to get Pei Wei ToGo.  It is extremely convenient that I can place my order online and have my food accurately prepared for pick up. Typically my food is ready for my wife and I within 20min and I always get front row parking because of the \"Pick Up Only\" parking signs.

I have eaten inside before and the service was average (per my 4 stars and not 5). 

Always a good choice for a quick dinner in the evening."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a descent option when you are looking for food that is pretty quick.  It also tastes good, so that helps too!

I like the sweet and sour chicken -  Cantonese sweet and sour sauce, red ginger, onions, green bell peppers, and pineapple.

Tasty ginger at this location."}
{"text":"It is so exciting to finally have a Pei Wei by our home, yay! We came to this location for pick-up for the first time last night and it is so nice. The landscaping on the outside is beautiful, the inside is clean, and modern looking. We ordered our food online and it was ready at the time it said it would be. The food quality was just as good as any other location and it was still good by the time we got home. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I just found out they are owned by PF Changs and that they are a fast food version. The mongolian beef is spectacular and Im very happy with the quality! The portions are perfect and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and great service. Just cant get enough of the shrimp fried rice!"}
{"text":"Initially ordered teriyaki crunch roll and it came before my boyfriend's meal. Took one bite and the rice was hard. The staff was great and didn't charge me for the order and also paid for my new meal. Overall the food wasn't that great. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch, yesterday, at PW Summerlin
We were a group of three, each one ordered and the food was served super fast. It reminded me of McDonald - I was a bit suspicious at first but when we all tasted the food - it was awesome - fresh, delicious and clean. 
Great place for high quality, quick, inexpensive Chinese food
Oh the waitress or busser who got our food, was super efficient and polite - good work"}
{"text":"I ordered food before my hour long work out next door to the restaurant and it still wasn't ready by the time I got in. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food was good. Excellent egg rolls, wonderful hot and sour soup, good pad Thai. However, service was slow and the noise level was harsh. We would get take out from her but would not come back to eat here."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this Pei Wei for a while, and it has definitely gone down hill. Got takeout tonight and was told it'd be ready at 7:35. Didn't get our food until 8, over an hour after we called it in. Wouldn't have been that big of a deal but then got home and there was only 3 PIECES OF CHICKEN IN MY MEAL??!! You would think if you had to wait that long the food would at least be made correctly. Only gave it two stars instead of one because I love their honey seared chicken. Won't be coming back to this Pei Wei location though..."}
{"text":"the food here has the right touch of spice that i can handle :) the prices are okay and the decor is nice. they also have the cola machine where you can mix/match all coke brand flavors."}
{"text":"this was my first visit to pei wei and i enjoyed it but felt it was just ok. i had the japanese chili ramen with tofu and a veggie spring roll. the spring roll was fairly bland and greasy. the ramen was good and i've got leftovers for tomorrow. honestly, i'd rather go to yc's if i want bbq but i'll probably try it again and actually get a meat dish"}
{"text":"Pei Wei always tastes great but WOW their  improved online ordering is a disaster.  Have ordered online for this location twice in the past week and neither has been ready at the pick up time.  So backed up you cannot even get inside to pay...no where to wait and had to wait 15 minutes after for my food. What is the purpose of setting a pickup time (ordered 53 minutes before my desired time) if i am going to sit around and wait. Not to mention staff was not helpful and did not apologize!  If you want Pei Wei my suggestion is to eat it there and skip the online ordering because it is awful."}
{"text":"The food was great.  The service when you're there is great but if you're ever trying to call in an order you might as well forget it because they never answer the phone. If things are getting too busy and you can't pick up the phone then they should have someone there specifically doing that."}
{"text":"Placed online order yesterday and it says pick up time was 7:51pm.  Arrive at 7:50 to a line out the door for takeout, one person helping the take out people.  Wait close to 10 minutes before I can even talk to anyone and once I do, the first they tell me is they are out of white rice.  Crazy to think an Asian restaurant is out of white rice but the worse part is that it is now 8pm and my order hasn't even made it to the kitchen yet.  I asked the lady how much longer and she said 25 minutes.  I had to leave as we had a movie to go to and canceled order.  Two other people said they had been waiting close to 45 minutes for their take out and a handful of people who hadn't even been helped. 

I get your busy, but tell people accurate times so they can plan their life and staff accordingly."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened.  Very disappointed with new orange chicken...not very healthy without veggies. Service used to be prompt...getting slower and slower...long wait and understaffed at ordering.  SAD!"}
{"text":"Food is decent and prices are a bit high.  Good Asian option and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Got take out, it was okay.  I didn't recognize any familiar faces in the staff there, could be turnover.  The food isn't as good there as it use to be a couple years ago."}
{"text":"Would not serve us after leaving us on hold for twelve minutes the yelp site said open till ten and they claimed they closed at 930 pm very bad customer service plus there doors were still unlocked young kids were working"}
{"text":"The biggest problem with Pei Wei is attempting to find an available parking space. This particular location shares building space with Starbucks and The Side Bar. At certain times of the day or night (lunch/dinner ), it's nearly impossible to find parking. The solution I've found is to pass the Pei Wei parking lot on McDowell and turn left into the business parking lot for EBL instead. They tend to have open parking spots (watch out for reserved spaces) that are a lot closer than parking across the street. In fact, I usually park at the EBL lot and walk to Pei Wei or Starbucks that way I'm never creeping around the lot, stalking patrons for their prime parking spaces. 

My co-workers and I frequent Pei Wei on a weekly basis. We order online and pick up at the restaurant; I've never, in the 2 years we've been doing this, had a problem with an online order. (We did have issues with call-in orders, but that has been over a year ago when they forgot to include my entrée. I made a trip back, my order was comped, and I was given two free lettuce wrap coupons. I left happy.) Often times, if we have more than a few minutes wait, Pei Wei comps us free drinks. (AKA Awesome customer service!) Their computerized drink machines are just too cool - any place that allows me to select syrups to add to my fountain drink is A-OK in my book. 

During the past two years, I've had the opportunity to sample nearly every item on the menu. My absolute favorites are (in no particular order): Coconut Curry Chicken, Shrimp Pad Thai, Ginger Broccoli (their version of beef & broccoli - tastes similar to the Mongolian which is also delicious), Japanese Chile Ramen with Beef, Pei Wei Spicy & Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad, Crab Wontons, Lettuce Wraps, and the Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls (though I am the only one of my friends who likes the salad rolls). 

A handy tip for those ordering online is the \"customize\" button. This allows you to select whether you'd like to add extra sauce (for free!) to your order or for the cooks to make your entrée extra spicy. There's a bunch of other options to choose from like steaming veggies or protein selections.

Pei Wei is one of my favorite restaurants. I even like it better than (gasp) P.F. Chang's because you can get some of the exact same dishes (Spicy Chicken, Mongolian, Lettuce Wraps) for a lot less cash. I also love the ambiance of the downtown Phoenix location - the red brick walls and unique flooring do a lot to add the kind of personality that most restaurant chains lack. 

Whether you're dining in or picking your meal up, you really can't go wrong with Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Everything at Pei Wei is always delicious. The dinner rush starts early so if you don't like lines you should start early too. This a modern fast paced eatery where everything is wonderful, the staff is always working their butt off to get your food out fast. Every thing is cleaned meticulously. They get slammed because everyone loves Pei Wei. If you don't like crowds find a quiet slow paced place. Pei Wei rocks and so should you !"}
{"text":"Very salty food. All sauces used in food preparation very heavy. All food taste lost in the sauces. Soup also thick and extreamly salty."}
{"text":"Three in our group, eating on a busy Friday night at about 7:30.  Three basic components met.  We walked in, ordered, sat down and within 5 minutes our meals came out.  The traditional lettuce wrap I had was fantastic in flavor and freshness.  My husband ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl and really enjoyed it.  We came in with big appetites and couldn't finish it all, so the portions are ample.  Didn't care for the chocolate chip cookies as much as I had hoped.  For technically being a fast food restaurant, we were very happy with service (friendly staff) and most importantly great tasting food.  This is a more comfortable dining area than the Pei Wei at Metro Center.  7th Ave and McDowell is very nice also.  Not a lot of asian food options in this area for some reason, so makes a great option."}
{"text":"I'll give it a 3 1/2 stars.  It works for me!

Pei Wei is great when I'm in that crossroads of 'I overpaid for my condo so I can't afford P.F. Chang's right now' and 'If I have Panda Express one more time this week I think I'm gonna smuggle a bear and paint it black and white'!  It fits the bill right in the middle!  

I don't always particularly crave this place as a must eat because while it is cheaper and more convenient than it's big bro P.F. Chang's, it definitely costs a few dolla-dolla bills more than Panda Express.  That being said, we'll often end up at Pei Wei because the kids don't want burgers, are a bit tired of Subway, and are sad looking at pandas eating bamboo on modern painted restaurant walls.

I like Pei Wei for the most part, but of course it definitely isn't authentic Asian cuisine in most cases.  They definitely cater to the American taste palette!  For what it is the place works great. 

The menu is pretty easy to read.  Right when you enter, as you walk down to the cashier station to order the menus are right in front of you on large lit boards to look at.  Very convenient, and good marketing technique!  Make em' hungry before they even order!  The have your appetizers, salads, noodles and rice bowls, and entrees all prominently displayed on their menu.  Most entrees run from the $6-$9 range depending on what you choose and if you get it with chicken, beef, shrimp, or veggies.  The great thing here is that with all of their signature entrees you can sub in brown rice for free!  Trust me, their brown rice is good!  We get it every time.

Here's what we usually order for our family of 4:

Asian Chicken Chopped Salad - Chicken with greens, napa cabbage, carrots, Thai basil, tomatoes, crispy wontons, toasted sesame seeds, with a sesame ginger vinaigrette.  Very good!  Light and flavorful!  Our favorite salad at Pei Wei, although sometimes I wish they would add some green onion and cilantro for a bit of punch.

Chicken Lo Mein - Chicken with lo mein noodles, rice wine sauce, scallions, garlic, onions, bean sprouts, shiitake mushrooms, and carrots.  The kids fav!  Although it is a bit greasy it tastes great!  Much better than the lo mein you find at that Panda place.  

We like these signature dishes as our favs, we'll usually pick one with chicken:

Honey Seared - Crispy chicken with honey garlic sauce, chili oil, rice sticks, scallions, and red bell pepper.  Yum...Asian-y!

Orange Peel - Crispy chicken with chile bean sauce, orange peels, scallions, garlic, snap peas, and carrots.  If you like Orange Chicken from the Panda, this is a good start for you!  

Spicy Korean - Chicken with Korean hot pepper sauce, garlic, mushrooms, carrots, onion, long beans, and toasted sesame seeds.  It's got a nice lil' kick to it!

Korean BBQ (brand new dish) - Chicken seared with carrots, scallions, in a smoky-sweet gogo BBQ sauce.  Then topped with a salad of green apples, bean sprouts, red bell peppers, mizuna, and a Korean vinaigrette.  It's good!  My new fav!  Now if they would only add a side order of Kim Chee to it...hello, taste buds!

The menu also has several options for kids, as well as a nice sized gluten free menu.  Pei Wei takes money from everyone, folks!

Serving portions are ok, although I wish they were a bit larger for the price.  A signature dish at Pei Wei (white or brown rice included) could feed two people...barely!  I can definitely finish an entire dish by myself!  

Service is fast, speedy, and usually pretty friendly.  I've never had problems before. Their take out is popular, but Pei Wei can sit a number of people in their place nicely.  I also like how they have hot mustard, siracha, shoyu, and vinegar at the ready by their tables so that you can concoct your little dipping sauce for your food.  

Down for some Asian-American food with no fuss and a bit of flair?  Give Pei Wei a try today!"}
{"text":"We go to the Grayhawk location every week and they do a better job cooking and have better customer service! We had to visit this location for convenience and we're extremely disappointed in the way our food tasted. Not sure why there is a huge discrepancy in the taste between the two locations but I'll drive an extra 15 minutes for better tasting food! Also, sat down on the bench with my toddler and the cushion was sliding out to the point where we would fall out of our seats! When I mentioned it to the bus girl she said it's because they use it as storage and someone probably hadn't closed it correctly! Um OK. Lol"}
{"text":"This is the best Pei Wei in the area. Food taste great 95% of the time! They do need to improve on keeping the dining room clean and sanitized."}
{"text":"I know I might some flack for only giving this place 3 stars, but really....it's no different than Chang's.  If I could give half stars, I would give it a 3.5.  Why?  Because I think it's better than Chang's.  It's exactly the same menu (just not as diverse), but cheaper.  If you are at this location, try Tott's instead.  I bet you'll start going there more often than here."}
{"text":"Not only was I given dirty plates, my \"potstickers\"..hell I wouldn't even call them that. They were frozen in the middle. Literal pork hockey pucks."}
{"text":"The service continues to struggle for the Surprise lunch crowd here. One cook, one server, one counter person and people constantly waiting. I'm here now for 30 minutes and still no food. I would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately tonight I used the Grayhawk location on line ordering. Not only did they get the double order wrong, they said when they handed me the order the details of the order. Once home and opened the order, it was missing the main ingredient honey seared chicken.  The email confirmation said to call the store for wrong orders so I did. I waited over 20 minuets listening to the on hold recording and finally gave up. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Normally 5 stars no problem. But this time 3stars and here's why. 1-  waited 30 minutes for sesame chicken & 2 egg rolls Togo   I live close so when I got home and everything but the chicken was piping hot well that makes  me concerned. Food not kept at my he proper temperature can be unhealthy. Why is my chicken lukewarm and everything else piping hot. ????"}
{"text":"We order take-out from Pei-Wei at least once a month.  We do usually choose the same things over & over but I love that I can always depend on having a good, satisfying meal! 

Last night we had the Chicken Pad-thai, the Thai Coconut Curry & an order of spring rolls with sweet chili sauce.

As usual I was satisfied with the pad thai.  YES I know this isn't genuine pad-thai but I love it nonetheless.  I love their tofu! I don't know what they do with their tofu that is different from everywhere else but I'd be a tofu convert if it was this way in more places! 

My husband loved the coconut curry.  The spring rolls were crisp without being the slightest bit of greasy.

I'm a big fan of their salads, Chicken lettuce wraps, Mongolian Beef, and Honey Seared Chicken as well."}
{"text":"So we ate here, not very good at all.  Mongolian beef was thick gooey sauce, like glue.  Basically this place was low quality Chinese food you expect from any number of junk Chinese shops that are everywhere.  So hard to find quality Chinese food.  Son got honey chicken, yuk.  Wife got some other chicken dish, also not good.  Egg rolls were overly greasy (think dripping grease), squeezed out 2 napkins worth of grease.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Well, this particular Pei Wei is SOoo much better than the test kitchen just down the road.  We figured we had to give it another chance after the abysmal dinner we had that one.  It was entirely different here.  Ordered the Mongolian Beef again and this time it was very good.  The crab Rangoons were good as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This used to be good place to dine, but tonight when we walked in, there were customers at only 3 tables. Wait time for dine-in was 45 minutes because of all their online orders. Seems like this place turned from a restaurant into a catering / online ordering place, they do not care about their walk-in customers. We left disappointed, will not be going here anymore."}
{"text":"You guys have GOT to do something about your takeout ordering. I've been on hold forever, with the same message repeating, suggesting the use of online ordering. Great, in theory, but Online Ordering has been temporarily unavailable at this location the last several times I've tried. What gives? You guys have too much business? Hanging up before ai lose my mind...

Update: 3/14. Still a nightmare. This time, I was able to place an online order, (only after ainpushed out my pickup time 45 minutes out. So I get there at my pickup time, and there's a line. Out the door. I stood there 30 minutes. Lucky for me, my order was just being bagged (a full 30 minutes AFTER MY PICK UP TIME). By then, there were 30 (yes, THIRTY) people waiting in line and in the waiting area to pick up food. The guy in front of me had been waiting a little longer than me, and they told him it was going to be another 25-30 minutes before his order was ready;  the woman before him had no order in the system (though she had a confirmation email, yes it was the correct location)."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe there aren't already numerous reviews of Pei Wei Asian Diner at this point in time. Perhaps as busy as the parking lot always is, it was a bit daunting for potential reviewers who were intimidated and kept on driving. Maybe those lucky few who secured a sacred parking spot stepped inside and were overwhelmed by the number of patrons stacked inside?

Don't get me wrong. I never have been unhappy in my many, many... many excursions to Pei Wei. If you like PF Chang's, you'll like this more informal diner version. I always tend to order the same dish (Pad Thai with Pork... it brings me a feeling of peace and comfort) and it's consistently delicious. In fact, it's quite craveable. On top of that,  the service has always been fast and hospitable. Usually when waiting on a take-out order it's not uncommon for someone behind the counter to offer me a complimentary beverage while I wait. If nothing else, watching 5 foot flames shoot from the woks in the kitchen is an enjoyable way to pass the time... if you're a pyromaniac.

If you go during peak times, you may be in for a bit of a wait for a table. It's not uncommon to wait 10 minutes or longer around lunchtime (Noon) or Dinner (6pm). If you are dining alone (I won't judge you), you can always phone ahead, zip in through the door marked \"Take Out\" and be on your way home from the gym to enjoy your deep fried morsels in no time flat. You may want to bring someone to ride wingman. Then they can run in to get it for you while you circle the terminally full parking lot. Otherwise you may end up walking from another ZIP Code or wishing they provided a shuttle service.

Great food and service on a consistent basis. Fast service... if you call and order ahead of time. If they can do something to alleviate the crowds, wait times and parking situation or better yet, offer a delivery option, I might be tempted to add another star. But that's just part of dining in the city and it won't deter me from many more trips there."}
{"text":"Worst one we have been to. Baseline & Val Vista.

We are here right now. Husband ordered shrimp fried rice..and it is saturated with carrots and very little flavor.

I ordered the steak/mango salad and got 4 small pieces of meat..and lettuce saturated with the vinaigrette dressing..like dripping. Nasty. It's a shame, because it has been so long since we ate at one and we were looking forward to it. Watching the hubby still pulling out shredded carrots right now!

Not exactly cheap for crap food.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Disastrously slow service, there were people leaving the queue. Over 45 minutes to get our order which only had 5 dishes. Salads were waiting to be served for over 20 minutes sometimes. All of the workers including the manager were involved in what seemed to be the most chaotic set of events I have ever witnessed in a restaurant. Will not be returning any time soon.

Edit: just returned. No change."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and perfectly spicy! I had the Vietnamese Lettuce wraps and an off the menu item \"Dan Dan Noodles with chicken\" and both we excellent!!!!! Service was great, place was clean, and I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Have not visited a Pei Wei in a while since did not know this one was sort of close to my house. When I went into the restaurant I was greeted by a very pleasant cashier who answered my questions about the menu. He informed me that even though the menu showcases chicken as the main protein for their bowls one can order it with either beef, chicken l, veggies, and tofu. After clearing up all the ordering and getting payment out of the way then the wait for the food begins. 

Everyone is made to order here which is great since I had them hold the scallions for me on everything. The cashier made it seem like the order would take 20-30 minutes but to my surprise it was only about 15 minute wait time. By the time that I got comfortable they were calling me up and handing my order to me.

I ended up ordering the Pei Wei special orange chicken. It was really good too and healthy than most orange chicken bowls I have had in the past. It seemed as if the chicken and orange flavor sauce was not stir fried. We had the Mongolian beef with no scallions and this bowl was cook so well. I also asked for extra mushroom and they were there too in abundance. The only complaint about this bowl was not enough beef, but I did not order extra. And the last bowl we had was the teriyaki beef bowl. This one was excellent too and all the veggies made it so much better. I ordered so many for various variety tonight at dinner. They say favorite is the spice of life."}
{"text":"Take Out Feedback. 
At 6:06 pm I place a small take out order, the order taker says pick up 6:35
We arrive to find all take out orders are behind, about four people still waiting to pick up.
**I ask how much longer, and girl at counter says 7:30pm** 
Really!!! 

***set the proper expectations, on days like these**
Suggestion to consumers for this location.
Call before, you go pick up to make sure your order is ready."}
{"text":"So I tried their new orange chicken and it's not nearly as good. The flavor is definitely very mild and lacking. Also I've only eaten 4 pieces of chicken and no rice yet. Size is considerably small compared to what is use to be. My partners order was way bigger than mine.  

Won't be getting this dish ever again unless it goes back to the original recipe."}
{"text":"Started out as a bad experience waiting 20 minutes for my meal after my guest had gotten theirs. Went looking for it twice and finally got it. Asked to see the manager and he was nice and helpful and made up for it so good customer service always wins!"}
{"text":"It's ok. I only went because they sent me a coupon in the mail, and I probably won't go back unless I get another coupon.
~$6 for a small plate, which comes with white/brown rice, meat, and a sauce. I don't think the food tastes any better than Panda Express, but they do have more 'healthy' options, since you can get your meat steamed instead of fried. Also, the prices are much higher than Panda for the amount of food you get.
Another strike against this location: they have a coke freestyle machine, but OVER HALF of the soda choices were empty! Including all Diet choices! Seriously??
Basically, there are way too many other choices in the area to go back to Pei Wei unless I get another free entrée coupon in the mail."}
{"text":"I would like to add to this review. More than a month later we decided to give it another try with the exact same outcome. Waiting on hold for 25 minutes, husband drives to the location, which is almost empty, cashiers are rude, they claim the phone system is down while 4 lines are flashing on hold on the phone and being ignored. This time my husband left without placing an order. We go to Pei Wei for the convenience, but honestly there are too many options in Phoenix to continue to give this place our business. On a side note, I'm not sure why the social media team for this chain keeps directing customers to submit a comment on their website. I have done this, as requested, and received NO response! I am left to assume that this chain has gotten so big that they no longer care about dissatisfied customers."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch experience here! Their new noodle bowl menu was good! Pad Thai tasty and spicy steak/shrimp chili great! 
I like how updated the place looks!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch place when you want quick gourmet food.  I like the Kung Pao Beef - flavorful, somewhat spicy, and a good quantity.  A good place to stop when out doing errands !"}
{"text":"If you like P.F. Changs, you owe it to yourself to visit Pei Wei. Pei Wei is the faster, cheaper little sister of P.F. Changs. The Pei Wei Spicy with chicken  and P.F. Changs Chicken are practically identical.

When we decide to have Pei Wei for dinner, nine times out of ten I pick my order up to eat at home. I love the convenience Pei Wei offers for take out. First off, you can order online. I love ordering food online, I never have to worry if the person on the other end of the line heard my order properly.  

When I do call in my orders, as soon as I give the Pei Wei employee my phone number, they know what I want to order, as they track past orders. This saves me time, as we almost always order the same dishes. Pei Wei also recently started a repeat customer reward program, where you get a free meal after you buy 10. Makes a good deal even better!

I am a big fan of the Lettuce Wraps, the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad, and the fact that they give you a choice of white or brown rice."}
{"text":"If you've ever eaten at a PF Changs, then the best way to describe this place is a Mini PF Changs with a hint of Pick Up Stix.  Most call this place your Fast Food PF Changs.  The obvious difference compared to a PF Changs, is the price, portions, and selections.  But the food taste similar.  

-Lettuce Wraps:  Never been a favorite of mine, but always a favorite with most.  

-Orange Peel Chicken:  This is basically the only thing I get here.  I usually get it with brown rice.  The sauce is heavy and is the reason I ask for it on the side.  You can also ask to cut down a bit on the sauce. 

-Fried Wontons:  Just like a Pick Up Stix.

This restaurant can get a bit busy during lunch time on the weekdays.  Pretty dead on the weekends each time I visited.  Service is good and your food is brought to your table. Never a bad feel from either the food or their service.  Yah! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, it can difficult to find places with good options, but I love getting a tofu bowl at Pei Wei. The first time I had it, I had to double check because it looks and has a similar texture to meat, but it's great. I love going to Pei Wei"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Pei Wei, and I get the same thing every time. I don't care for chicken, so I get a side of the lo mein noodles with lo mein sauce without chicken. It costs a whopping $1.95 and totally fills me up! I also love their edamame and crab wontons. Sooo yummy! First you order your food at the front, and then choose a seat and your food comes out in no time. I love that even though this isn't your standard sit down restaurant with a waiter, it is still classy and the staff takes care of you well. Don't forget to leave a couple bucks behind, especially if you made a mess, since their staff comes and cleans your table. Great food for a great price. I am thinking I want some Pei Wei for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Pick up employee all but ignored me. Every time the phone ran, he would ignore the customer he was assisting."}
{"text":"It says the have free wifi. They do not. Was an inconvenience when that is why we picked to eat there on our work lunch."}
{"text":"Great Asian menu! Tastes great, healthy, good variety. Best Asian \"fast food\" for your money. Repeat customer."}
{"text":"This is my 4th times that I came here for lunch and never disappointed with my food. I always ordered the same every time. 

Japanese ramen noodle with steak and shrimp. I usually change the steak to chicken instead since I don't eat that much red meat.

The ramen noodles is so flavorful and spicy the way I like it and  the breaded chicken and shrimp are crunch outside and tender inside which it's perfect .

The restaurant is very clean and all the staffs are well trained and fast.

I checked in, in this place and I received FREE appetizer edamame humus and the whole set of platter, it was delicious! thank you Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and on time. Love the online ordering-very convenient!  Food is always hot and delicious. However...NO FORKS FOR TAKE OUT?  That is poor management. Either you didn't order in time or there was a problem with the order...either way, hustle your booty to Walmart and buy a couple boxes: Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a reasonable price. Little step up from the typical fast food. I enjoy coming here for a simpler quick bite."}
{"text":"I just love sitting at the bar at Pei Wei. I can watch the people cooking. Very exciting and interesting.  I usually order Mandarin Kung Pao with chicken because I LOVE peanuts. I have never had a bad experience at Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I never go in, I only ever call in for take out.  It's decent food, sometimes the wait is a little long, but decent for a chain."}
{"text":"Always good food, fast service and a great location. I'm not a big fan of their new way of ordering. I realize they tried to make it so you can customize each dish, however it's a bit confusing and overwhelming. Frankly, I ignore it and just order the way I usually do. Their new sushi selection is very good!"}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei.  Good quality food.   Chicken is all white meat.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the hustle of the cooks and servers. The food was very tasteful and came out hot. The ahi tuna bowl at $5.99 is an incredible buy. The ahi was sashimi grade and prepared like Hawaiian poke style...for a fast food style Asian restaurant... They deserve the four stars."}
{"text":"I walked in and placed an order to go. When I asked for the 2 kids meal drink cups, I received attitude and an argument from the girl that took the to go order. The food was good."}
{"text":"Haven't dined in at this location yet, only gotten take out. I've always gotten the same thing (pad Thai) and have not been disappointed at any location. Food is usually ready in the time frame they give you. Hot and sour soup is delicious too"}
{"text":"Quick service and they have vegetarian options, which are few and far between here in Phoenix"}
{"text":"\"Ok\" describes my experience well. 

I was a bit disappointed by the Pad Thai ordered here. The taste was alright, but it was primarily noodles with a few snap peas and broccoli shoots (I ordered vegetables and tofu). The tofu is also prepared in a very strange manner. Whatever they do makes it look like mushrooms, and it feels almost pasty in your mouth. 
I would have been much more satisfied if my meal were $3-4 dollars and not $7.

The place was clean and the service friendly. 

The dining room was super loud though, and it was hard to hear the person I was with."}
{"text":"We are from the Midwest and are visiting Phoenix on a vacation. We stopped in this place for some quick Asian food. What a great surprise! I had the Mongolian chicken and it was great. Very similar to PF Chang. You order at the counter and they bring the food. I wish we had one of these where I live."}
{"text":"Service was good. But drinks were consistently weak...even with the up sell of the $4 double shot."}
{"text":"Test Kitchen keep testing! 
Visited twice and it may be the last time, which is unfortunate because I really wanted to like this place. 

Food: First visit I had the Pineapple Curry fried rice with added extra protein (+1.99-added shrimp). I don't even want to know how many shrimp I would have gotten had I not got the added protein. 
The rice was just okay even with added spices and pineapple, it was so \"okay\" I didn't finish the rest because it just wasn't exciting or tastefull enough for me to finish. I did not get again on my second visit. 
Thai Sweet Chile Wings was a two time choice. First time I was excited for them, I cant pinpoint this but one of the flavors are overwhelming than others and that's not including the \"spice\" it's supposed to offer. The second time I got them same thing, very overwhelming in a high sodium type of way (granted that is asain and Chinese food). I will not order them again, but I would recommend you try them. 

Service: I can't fully submit a report on service but it appears they offer some kind of membership that they ask if you're a member of at checkout and that's all you hear about it. They don't ask if you want to know about it or offer anything about it, obviously not important to become a member. (I wouldn't). 

Seating: They offer inside and outside seating. The outside is gated off from the public which is really neat, with that you will get servers. 

I've had WAY better, I would recommend but I would start small to avoid disappointment. Price doesn't match the quality and that's where I was fooled but high price doesn't mean great food. Try a few items."}
{"text":"It's hard to give a place more than 3 stars when the food is decent but you can get much better and more authentic for the same prices elsewhere. This is quality Chinese fast food, but it's uninspired and you feel like you're at a glorified McDonald's after more than 3 trips here. However, once in awhile McDonald's does hit the spot and Pei Wei may do just that for you as well."}
{"text":"Very friendly and responsive staff.
My go to for fresh, tasty, and fast Asian food.
Partial to their spicier foods, but really can't go wrong with any menu selection."}
{"text":"We thought we would visit Pei Wei after a year or so of not being happy with their new menu and poor quality food.  It's a Tuesday night and the place is totally empty. It used to be packed.  We really feel it's gone down hill.  About 10 years ago we loved to dine here. All their dishes were tasty. Tonight the Potsticker were dry and over cooked. Honey  seared chicken blah and ginger broccoli was way too salty with no flavor Even the quality of napkins and fortune cookies have gone down hill.  What's up Pei Wei??  Thumbs down. Not sure we will come back."}
{"text":"The service was horrible :( The employees moved so slow and just give off an air of not caring. Not going back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that on yelp their hours show them open at 1030am but when you arrive they don't open until 11am. Waiting in the car to pick up a large order makes me think twice about catering from here. Don't get me wrong the food is great as always but they need to fix this."}
{"text":"Have dined here many times in the past but was very disappointed on our last visit Wednesday night. It began with the cashier who seemed to be extremely bothered when I asked to her repeat our order to make sure we didn't forget anything. There was 6 in our party so we had a large order and some of the food had very little taste. The sweet and sour chicken was a bit chewy.  The kids chicken lowmein was not seasoned very well. The chicken broccoli was decent but the lettuce wraps were definitely delicious which gave it a second star. 
All in all the visit was not up to par and we were somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Pei Wei in years, but I wanted to try it out again.  I love their decor, atmosphere, food, and drink choices.  I wish I could come here more often.  It didn't help to find a roach running around the floor, but when I told an employee, he quickly took care of the pest."}
{"text":"My order was due to be picked up at 12:59 i was there. Order was ready at 1:15, lettuce wrap meat hardly any in the box, what the heck are those hard white things ik they are water chestnuts too many, chicken in general taos dish was hard to chew. Was that actually chicken. Beef mongolian tastes like left over meat, lettuce for wraps are not big enough for wrapping anything, little triangles. Extra sauce was not ample enough, wont be back. I should call the health department, girl putting food together with bare hands after flicking her hair. Get your act together. I spent $28 for shit food"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pork eggs rolls. They came out pasty, greasy and cold in the middle. The dough was chewy and raw, worst egg rolls I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm..... Chinese? I think not. If you are expecting a great meal, go elsewhere. Pei Wei is a good not so fast version of fast food. It isn't fine dining, but it certainly serves a purpose. I'll always pick Pei Wei over a fast food burger, and how anyone can go to Panda Express when this is a couple blocks away is beyond me. Pei Wei is also a bit overpriced for what it is. 

For a long time before the airlines went insane over carry on, i used to bring a Pei Wei kids meal as my personal upgrade. It's small, well packed, and used to make the other passengers jealous. 

I don't go to Pei Wei so much anymore. Long lines and inadequate service keep me from venturing in their door on any whim. I will order ahead and pick up. They rarely get my order right, but whatever i get usually tastes pretty good. I just never go with the expectation that I will get my correct order."}
{"text":"Only thing I've tasted so far that was palatable is the Wonton Soup."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei. My first time visiting this location. My husband and I got the sesame chicken, pad thai and spring rolls. Fast service on a weekday and the service/food was great."}
{"text":"My co worker recommended me to go here and try them out, so I did! I give them a A+ for great customer service, the lady was very helpful for my first visit. I placed a to go order, waited maybe 5-10 mins and it was pretty busy. The guy ( I'm assuming was the manager/owner) who handed me my food was awesome. His personality was just A++! I requested them to make my Mongolian chicken extra spicy and they did an awesome job on that. And the crab Rangoon were oh so delicious. I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch! there quick whether its take out or dine in! My fav. are the spring rolls & lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The new Orange chicken bowl is good. Not a huge fan of the Sushi rolls or I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I like the Wei. I enjoy your kung pao shrimp, lettuce wraps, Pei Wei spicy chicken, and a recent fan of the lemon pepper shrimp. 

I have not been able to find a decent Chinese take out by me. The west side is being dissed no pizza, no china-men, no fish. I need to open a restaurant clearly. 

I find the dishes to be large, tasty, and relatively inexpensive. It's Chinese take out and next to the places I have tried in the area Pei Wei is a rock star!"}
{"text":"Less than impressed with the past 2 experiences here. The food is always good, but waiting for the food is brutal. Both times it has taken 30 minutes for the food to come out. Obviously there needs to be action taken and have more staff on. This is the only location I have been to that seems to have this problem. I was not the only one angry about the wait time for the food. Several others were furious and requested refunds. I asked a food delivery guy if it normally takes 30 minutes for the food to arrive and he nonchalantly blamed the togo orders and didn't offer a solution. Very poor customer service. I will think twice about coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I ordered online and its 20 minutes late.  When i expressed concern to the staff they just dismissed me and said they dont have a way to update it online.  Not even a little apologetic.   Really bad customer service!"}
{"text":"They where running a little behind during the busy dinner rush and forgot to put my actual lettuce for my lettuce wraps. I called a kind talked to Jon Sargent. He was very understanding, apologized and offered to refund me. I just asked if my boyfriend could swing by and pick it up. He of course said yes and included some gift cards for the trouble. Very nice. Always happy with the service and food."}
{"text":"Really good Asian food! Very fresh and great portions. I love the Lo Mein. Their sauces are amazing too! I love the sweet and sour. Great prices and much fresher and better tasting than PF Changs."}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, and cheap. Is this going to be the best Chinese food you've ever had? I doubt it, but in terms of the \"fast food\" Chinese category it's far superior to Panda Express and various copycats. And with a menu that expands surprisingly often there is bound to be something new to try. The kung pao and honey seared chicken are both mighty nice."}
{"text":"After all these years of eating at this place I am through with this location.  On a Wednesday night the cashier states it will be a 45 minute wait!!  No manager on duty as usual.  What a joke!!!  Theres absolutely no accountability for the front of the house.  To-go orders are always messed up and NOBODY I mean NOBODY picks up the damn phone.  Dont know if this is a franchise place or corporate but someone needs to pull their head out of their ass and learn how to run a business.  Very sad!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to have thai and chinese food. I really loved their menu and customer service. If you are can of Pf Chang then you must visit this place. All their wok dishes are good."}
{"text":"It's been years since I last set foot in a Pei Wei because honestly the last visit wasn't  a yummy one at all.  I thought the food was too salty and greasy.
So one night we had no idea what to eat (imagine that??) and Pei Wei's sign was just brighter than all the rest. I chose Japanese spicy  fried noodles and the BF chose Korean Short Ribs-for an appetizer we got an order of crab wontons.
My 3 stars are just for the cream cheese crab wontons-those suckers were gooooood and real crab is used-YUMMMY!!!!
I had to return my dish as it had no taste and was not spicy at all. The weird thing was no matter how much soy sauce I added there was still no freakin taste....
As a replacement I got Chicken Teriyaki and you know what? That was pretty good-the chicken breast chunks are all fried which added an interesting element to the dish. The BF liked his Korean Short Ribs but we both agreed that the star of the night was the crab cream cheese wontons!!!!
The service was great-when I explained that I wasn't happy with my food no questions were asked and without hesitation I was told to pick whatever I wanted instead."}
{"text":"I live on the other side of town near Santa Fe Station and was going to Chipotle after google mapping it, but saw this place next door. Had never eaten there before so went in to look at their menu thinking teriyaki chicken sounded good.  This was the worst teriyaki chicken I have ever had. Chicken was very dried out. I usually get teriyaki chicken at Teriyaki Maddness, Samurai Sams, Sushi Loca, or even in malls food courts. Its always very tender. This didn't even taste like teriyaki sauce. I  gave it two stars because the brown rice and veggis were fresh and good, although the spices in it ruined everything because of it not tasting like a teriyaki flavor.  Don't think I'll experiment again at this place."}
{"text":"It is what it is...if you need Asian food quick and you want to know you probably won't get food poisoning it's a decent option in a city with pretty poor Asian options..."}
{"text":"If you like PF Chang's, but not the price tag, definitely come here. The mongolian beef is identical, same portion (small), half the price. Spring rolls are tasty too. They also have lettuce wraps, like PF Chang's is known for. Their menu is small and compared to PF Chang's the prices are low, but I think their competition is Tott's Asian Diner right down the street.  Lower prices, bigger menu, same stirfry wok's, spectacular service, clean, super nice owner who remembers your name for years :)"}
{"text":"Used to be our place for the occasional fake Asian food experience when we couldn't afford real authentic and didn't want to steep to Panda Express. However, this time we left feeling very disappointed. My brother got a noodle dish that was subpar but passable. It was my chicken that made us want to leave and never come back. It was sweet and sour chicken with rice. The chicken was dry, the rice was even more so which we didn't know was possible. The ratio of meat to rice was also ridiculous for the price, barely any meat on the dish. Don't know if we will be coming back for awhile."}
{"text":"I went here for a work lunch.  I have seen this chain all over, but I never really stopped anywhere.  There are wok entrees (a protein of your choice and a sauce and style - spicy, Thai, honey, etc. with brown/white rice or lettuce), noodle dishes, salads, spring rolls, soups, and sushi rolls.  Basically it was a widespread of Americanized Asian food.  I got the spicy Pei Wei chicken with lettuce.  It was pretty decent, a little too saucy, but overall satisfying.  This is not the most authentic place for Asian food, but it's cheap, fast, and tasty enough."}
{"text":"I visited Pei Wei for the first time last Sunday.  We told the cashier it was our first time visiting and she was very helpful.
I loved the fountain drink machine.  The carbonation was good and they have pretty much any kind of soda you could want, including some I didn't even know existed.
I ordered a combo plate which was a smaller portion and included a starter.  I went with the Hot and Sour soup which is normally a favorite of mine, and we started with some Crab Wontons.
The flavor of the soup was good, but the consistency was much too thick for my palette, almost like a gravy vs a soup.  I would not order it again.
The crab wontons were good, had a lot of crab flavor and were presented sitting in a chili type of sweet and sour sauce.  I enjoyed them but some people might now like the wontons swimming in that sauce.
My mongolian beef was delicious, and my boyfriend ordered a thai coconut chicken which also had a great flavor.  
With the exception of the soup, all the rest of our food was fresh and very flavorful.  I also felt that the value for the money was superb.  I will definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"I make a real effort to avoid chains, but I can't stay away from this place.  We have one in KC and it is the perfect solution to a Sunday hangover.  

Fresh, fast and clean....I feel good eating here."}
{"text":"Delish!! I had the beef fried rice , my bf had the teriyaki chicken with white rice . Both dishes were hot, fresh and tasty . This is a great go to place for quick Asian food."}
{"text":"If I am understanding correctly, Pei Wei is basically PF Changs with a slimmed down menu and faster service.  That works for me.

I came here last week on a whim since I was hungry and wanted to try something I had not tried before.  I first saw the wonton soup on the menu. Being a sucker for wonton soup I knew I had to get a small cup of that.  Knowing that would not make a complete dinner I went for something more substantial.  I had heard good things about the chicken lettuce wraps and went for it.  I ordered to go and had my food in just a few minutes.

The soup was good.  The lemongrass gave a nice citrus freshness to the broth.  There were three or four wontons floating around.  These were nothing extraordinary but the skins were tender and the filling inside was good. They just seemed a little prefabricated. I feel much the same about the chicken wraps.  Nothing stallar but over all good.  There was a lot of chicken and mushroom. More than it looks like really.  Considering I made a meal of lettuce and some ground chicken says a lot.  The sauce for the wraps is where the meal jumped up a notch. That sauce, while not entirely necessary, gives a bold flavor boost. I liked it very much.  My one complaint is with the lettuce I was given.  Some leaves were slightly browned.  Most, if not all, were torn which made them difficult to actually stuff and roll.  It was frustrating but not impossible to eat.

This wasn't a bad meal.  I may not come back all too soon but I may come back and try something else off the menu.  Some day."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is delicious! This location always has great service even when they are very busy. I recently had an order of the crab wontons and the Korean beef lettuce wraps and both were fantastic. I have always had good experiences here. The garlic sriacha that they have in the little jars is also great and a must have if you like spicy. 

They do have a pick a bunch of flavors coke machine so that is always good. The wait can sometimes be around 15 minutes during the lunch or dinner rush but it is well worth it. The price is around $12 for an average lunch with a drink but it is a great quality meal for the price. Overall, great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Always fast friendly, service. I love the new sushi rolls, I've only tried the Wasabi Crunch Rolls because I love the \"crunch\" with the spicy tuna. The food always tastes fresh. Though the pork roll was flavorful, it was dropping in grease. I wouldn't recommend if that's the way they serve them all the time."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service over ever experienced! Order food online, wait, go to pick up said food when your order was said to be ready and told there are 21 orders a head of you and your food won't be ready for an hour! Really? An hour for some take out? And no reason given, no offer of any compensation, nothing!"}
{"text":"I went in here around 8 pm last night (a Wednesday) and ordered two to go meals. Kung Pao Chicken was too hot (spicy) for me even though I asked for the light version of the sauce. My husband liked it because he likes hot and spicy and that was his order anyway. I got Thai Coconut Curry with Chicken and it was horrible. There were way too many cooked white onions which grossed me out. And where was the coconut or curry? I couldn't taste either one in the dish. Usually you can at least get a good curry flavor in that dish but not here. I started to pick out the onions but there were so many that it was easier just to pick out the chicken. Then I doused it with soy sauce to make it edible. Even then I could only eat about a third of the chicken because the onion flavor was so predominant I really couldn't stand it but I was so hungry I had no choice but to eat some of it. While I was waiting there was a table of diners that I saw put what looked like their whole entire meals into to go containers. Now I know why."}
{"text":"When we got there the line was long and all the tables full.  I was worried about time and seating. Didn't need to worry. Line moved quickly, tables cleared, food was hot, fresh and delivered quickly. In spite of Raintree traffic I will be there again soon.  By the way, the manager ( nice lady ) was working her butt off delivering food and cleaning up."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Pei Wei chain but the management and consistency is different with each restaurant. 
I love the concept, I like the menu and I like the flavor profiles of the individual dishes.
You just have to hit the right Pei Wei for the best experience."}
{"text":"I only came here because my coworkers wanted to come. The food is flavorless, yet spicy. And although I love spicy foods, I hate that they use it to attempt to hide the fact that the food is so bland."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei because nothing ever changes.

You come here after a long time and order your usual dish and you get what you've always ordered... I love that! 

The same dish at the same price done the way you like, what more can you ask for and that's why Pei Wei is at the top of my foodie list for \"fast food\" places.

Thanks PEI WEI!!!!"}
{"text":"I use to come PW all the time when I lived closer to it and when the prices were a little lower. I use to be a big fan but lately the price hikes are so noticeable that it's just not worth the money for what your getting and when I made my way over here this time around it was just out of location and time convenience.

They use to carry a japanese chicken dish for lunch that was only $6.75 but now all their chicken dishes are 8.50 or more and if you want beef or shrimp it's gonna be more. Our meal consisted of two chicken dished for about $19 with tax, but no drinks.... Boo!

Even though the food still tastes great I'm still not a big fan of their high prices. I know for sure I can get an entire great tasting meal elsewhere for $10. In a nutshell this place use to be great but now it's just a so-so on my list."}
{"text":"Terrible. 
Two people, two lunches, one appetizer. The app, crab wontons, was delivered first and had a good flavorful sweet and sour sauce that I used to flavor the rest of my food. One star for the appetizer.
I see that even though you may order your food on the same ticket as your date, the food comes out one at a time. Which meant that my food was delivered and since my date and I didn't care to share dishes we both sat there awkwardly waiting for his while my food got cold. 
\"Spicy Korean\" was neither spicy nor korean, nor did it have any flavor at all. But it had a shitload of carrots for all you rabbits out there. I find it amusing that garbage restaurants think a sprinkle of sesame seeds suddenly makes food \"Korean.\" It doesn't and your marketing sucks. 
The crowning jewel of this fiasco came down to a competition between the Dan Dan Noodles and the birds. While I was attempting to choke down my too-soft spaghetti drowned in too much sugary-sweet brown sauce, little grisly bits of chicken and a handful of bean sprouts that I tried valiantly to save with some hot sauce (and failed miserably), the birds were stalking us. One bird attempted to make his domination attempt known to the other birds by yipping at them and following them around like a nagging old wife chasing her husband with a rolling pin. This continued as they waited for us to finish our food so that we could leave so that they could attack the leftovers. I eventually gave up on my food and just stopped eating; it was that bad. By the time we were finished and standing up to leave, no less than fifteen birds were advancing toward our table. We took the dirty, food-filled plates inside to turn them in but that didn't stop the birds from descending on the table in search of any bits of missed rice that may have fallen onto the ground."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had a coupon for buy one entree get one free, but the bar code wasn't on my email & I couldn't get one to pull up on my phone. The manager took the meal off our bill anyway, even though we were going to eat there anyway. And the food was awesome as always."}
{"text":"Dog  friendly and staff was nice. We ate on the patio with our dog. The management came out and even wiped down the table for us.  The food is so much better than expected we would come back again."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from here this past week.  I was really looking forward to honey-seared shrimp with brown rice and some citrus iced tea.  I love the citrus iced tea and love that you can add an orange to it.  I was disappointed by the honey-seared shrimp however.  It was an adequate portion size but it had very few red peppers in it, and the shrimp was not as fluffy as it could have been.  The shrimp actually seemed like it was over-fried or had been sitting out awhile.  I was exactly on time- 12:40pm, to pick up my food.  The service was good enough but they had to ask if I'd like utensils and I kind of think they should just include chopsticks, napkins and the fortune cookies.  I had to go grab my drink and the cookies myself.  That's okay because it's Pei Wei but I still won't go back because this Pei Wei is just not as good as Columbia, MD's Pei Wei."}
{"text":"My go to for a dairy/soy free Asian meal... but please wash your vegetables properly.... they taste super dirty!!!"}
{"text":"Spicy and good. Love the Thai green curry."}
{"text":"Note to staff and management, maybe don't package hot food with sushi for take out orders, leaving hot food containers with/on top of the sushi while the order is all bagged up and waiting for pickup.  This has happened to us the last two times ordering take out, leading us to throw out the sushi."}
{"text":"True story: when Pei Wei first started, I got stuck on an airplane seated next to some VP from PF Chang's. Of course, PF Chang's created Pei Wei. 

At the time I was young, (he was hitting on me), and he said, \"you say, 'Pay-Way'...but the inside/inside joke is: say 'pee-wee, like a little PF Chang's.\"  \"LIKE A LITTLE PF CHANGS\". That's what he said and it's been denied ever since, by everyone who ever lived. This was at least two corporate owners ago, so the \"deny/deny/deny\", at this point, is plausible 

So when they opened, I went once, probably got orange chicken, which in America, at any Asian restaurant, is waaaaaaaaaaaaay too sweet.  I've never gone back.

I saw an Pei Wei ad on TV ad this week comparing Pei Wei and Panda Express. Said it was fresher, white meat vs dark...sounded good.  I know Panda Express is wretched but it's fast, it's not that wretched and there are items less sweet than friggin' orange chicken. So this ad convinced me to at least TRY Pei Wei and  I gave it another shot.

{couldn't easily sign up for the club, btw}

Looking at the menu online (and, oh, by the way, fix the phones and website. You know who you are) I saw Dan Dan Noodles and recalled eating this dish at PF Chang's years ago. 

Memo to Pei Wei menu writers: people eat with their eyes. Words on a menu?????  So, when you describe Dan Dan Noodles with \"House-ground white meat chicken...\" who is that appealing to?  Who seeks out \"ground chicken\"?  No one.  Fried chicken, yes. Ground chicken?  Hoo-fah!

Even the rest of the description doesn't make up for it: \"House-ground white meat chicken, garlic and scallions, wok-seared in a chile soy sauce and served over steamed noodles. Finished with steamed bean sprouts and fresh julienne cucumbers.  (Somewhat Spicy)\"

While in line,I was distracted from the Dan Dan by the \"JAPANESE STEAK & SHRIMP CHILE RAMEN. Described:

\"NEW RECIPE! Wok-seared house-cut marinated flank steak, fresh-cooked shrimp and noodles in a spicy-savory Japanese sauce with minced garlic, red bell peppers, carrots, snap peas, onions, cilantro and lime.\"  BETTER!

Friggin' delicious!  Really.  Steak and shrimp, spicy. Good!  $10- good deal, good flavor.  

Don't understand the service-sort of 1/2 server."}
{"text":"Okay, we were some of the customers who cashed in on the 'buy one entree get one free' coupons through our email. 

We usually do not eat out for dinner. We are more of a take it to go couple. So we got here around 5:30. We were third in line, and behind a couple who had no clue what they wanted. 

Andrew, the guy behind the counter, was awesome. He was really calm, very friendly and didn't let them stress of what was going on in the kitchen get to him. At one point, the kitchen needed the paper wrappers necessary for egg rolls. Apparently these were in his side of the wall. He was busy taking care of dine in customers, take out customers and everything in between. One of the women in the kitchen area very rudely told him they had no more egg roll wrappers left. Without missing a beat, he handed over a large stack of these papers. He then turned to us with a smile and took our order. 

We went to find a seat, but there were a few tables with dishes waiting to be cleared. We ended up clearing one of the tables and wiping it down, as the alternative tables were not to our liking (by the bathroom or by the front door). They offered soy, reduced sodium soy, and hot pepper sauce. 

Since the food is not made until ordered, we waited for about 10 minutes before it arrived. Meanwhile, there was a line nearly ot the door forming. Food arrived and it was A LOT! The flavor was great. The Sesame Chicken had some spice to it. The Pad Thai had portobello mushrooms as well. That was a nice addition. We ended up taking quite a bit of food home. Luckily they have 'to go' containers by the drink station. Very nice. 

Good food, good prices, and Andrew was very pleasant.  They could do a bit better cleaning the tables, as we saw a few that remained dirty for quite a while."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the PFChang's-style food at PeiWei! The staff is efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable. I always recommend PeiWei to friends and family and we have nothing but praise!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei certainly is more of a \"fusion\" restaurant than authentic asian. That said, for fast food they have a decent menu. My own preference is the Thai Dynamite with chicken. I always ask for \"extra spicy\" in order to turn up the heat - but it's still not what I would call \"Thai hot\"!  :-)"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Normally we love pei wei. There were about 5 other families/parties in the restaurant. After we ordered we went to find a table and there were NO CLEAN TABLES. There were many tables open but they were all covered in dirty dishes. There was trash all over the floor. We had to clear our own table and wipe down the table ourselves. Clearly no one had done any cleaning in a long time. The food was not great either... I ordered the new orange chicken and most of the chicken was not cooked. I had to spit it out. We asked to speak to a manager and they said that there wasn't a manager in the restaurant tonight. Wow. We won't be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Pei Wei rocks! I'd eat here over PF changs any day!! Anything off this menu rocks and is fresh. They have an open kitchen for you to watch if you'd like. Service is fast and it is affordable. Great place for dates! I highly recommend the crab puffs with the red sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped in today at closing time. They are shutting down and thoroughly cleaning but stopped to take my order in a friendly and efficient manner.

Everyone is working and no one is standing around chitchatting. The food came out hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Brought my kids for the first time to Pei Wei here on Bell Fountain shopping area. My son gobbled up the Lo Mein and dumplings. I was happy with the Pad Thai. I said hi to the manager and my son made a big deal about loving the food, and the manager popped me a $10 gift card for our next visit! Sweet. So we went back a week later, and enjoyed it even more. Soon to be a mainstay for the Murrow kids, no doubt. 

The cafeteria style ordering works for busy families too. Beer & wine available too."}
{"text":"What in the world has happened to this place?  The dining area is a pig sty. The food is slow to come out and you pay more and get less.  Even the good napkins they had are gone. Somebody step up and fix this place!!!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is always busy, that's gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it.

Most Pei Wei's are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they aren't located in the ghetto.

As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you won't find it at Pei Wei. I don't understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isn't even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the 'fake' Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food \"manadrian style\" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, \"Ooo.. yeahh.. I'm just not sure about that.\" Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesn't mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant.

The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, that's a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They aren't your family. You don't know them.

Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians."}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a month. This is my go-to take out place. We usually have 5 or 6 orders and they always take care to make sure they are correct. (Sucks to get where you're going and realize you have the wrong food)
I've never had a bad experience here. Usually go with the lettuce wraps (original), sesame chicken or Mongolian beef. 
I love Pei Wei. Yum yum yummmmm."}
{"text":"Terrible service we waited on hold so long we ended up driving there, all for the blonde girl to stop look at me and then pick up the phone. (With me on the line staring right at her). We are still waiting for our food 35 minutes later.  So I figured I have time to waste and am yelping.  
My advice hire more people, and use better customer service skills."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Perfect choice when you are craving PF Chang food in a hurry. My niece loves their Orange Shrimp and I'm a huge fan of the Dandan Noodles. 

My husband is not a fan of counter service venues, so I have to wait when I'm with someone else to grab lunch here. It's quite a treat!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Greasy and gross. I ordered the lettuce wraps and was blown away by the amount of grease on my plate so I ate a protein bar that I had in my purse."}
{"text":"All around great flavor and portions. Perfect for take-out always consistent the fam eats here about three times a month never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice and clean. Ordering our food was fast and easy. The manager Luis was great. Despite being very busy he came and checked on us and made sure we were happy with our food and service. It was a great dining experience. We will definitely come back. There's plenty of parking and some outdoor dining as well."}
{"text":"The staff at this location was very friendly but I was not impressed by the food. It was too salty and lacking in other flavors. It may have been the dish I had because I have heard good things from others. However, I'm not tempted to try it again."}
{"text":"Always loved Pei Wei but the last few times we've ordered take out we've had massive issues with wait times when picking up. We first dismissed it as a fluke or a busy night, but it had persisted and it's honestly pretty ridiculous. The staff look to be trying their best and doing a good job handling the frustrated customers but they definitely need a better carry out system. It's unacceptable in its current state."}
{"text":"I'm torn in a review for here because the food is great. It's the customer service that will stop me from coming back. I asked for my meal with rice noodles and it was brought to me with egg noodles. After asking nicely for it with rice noodles they took it away without apologizing and brought it back with the correct noodles. However, before I took a bite I realIzed they just slid the old noodles out and replaced with the new. There were still egg noodles mixed in my dish. This is extremely annoying as I can not eat egg products. This location needs a serious customer service over haul as well as dietary restriction training."}
{"text":"We have been regulars here, we've had a good experience the few times we've eaten in the restaurant. I want to give 5 stars but because the ToGo portions are WAY smaller than eat-in and still the expensive menu price, we unfortunately had to cut down on eating here because it doesn't even fill us up and it's too much money. 

The app stops working a lot too which makes it harder to order especially when coming from work. We really love Pei Wei and would love to see REAL portions in the To Go orders! :)"}
{"text":"My second time here and again very pleased with the food and the overall cleanliness of the establishment.  I wish that the cashier was a little more personable but, she did a good job.  Food is not spicy enough even when you tell them #10.  Good for a chain"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick meal before bowling league that was healthier than fast-food.  The larger percentage of the menu is designated as \"spicy\" just ask and they may be able to tone it down if you prefer a less bold taste.

Decided on the Spicy Chicken salad with the dressing on the side.  Service was quick and friendly as it usually is here.  My salad arrived as requested with the spicy dressing on the side; however, the chicken and greens were drowning in a cloyingly sweet saute sauce used in the preparation of this dish.  By the time i was halfway through the salad there was nothing left but what can be best described as cabbage soup.  Not sure if this is the usual for this salad or just a heavy-handed use of sauce by the chef.  Either way it's too much. some very good flavors but specify light sauce if you order.

Prices are very reasonable here and there is a good variety of menu items to choose from.  Can get very noisy during peak hours."}
{"text":"Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"The wait time for the food was way too long- 30 minutes for a bowl of spicy noodles with some veggies. I'm a guest from out of state but this is nothing better than my local Panda joint. They should probably let the customers cook the food cause we could do it faster. 
The food was okay but the portions were a bit big. While I was waiting for the food (+30 min) I noticed a lot of people just ate a few bites and left the food on the table. So much food wasted- there must be a reason for that right?? 
The bathrooms weren't clean, barely had soap no towels and toilet didn't even flush!! 
I hope next time I'm down here that it isn't this bad."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing Pei Wei experience I've ever had. A total waste of time and money. At 7 pm on a Saturday night. It wasn't busy but the Mandarin Green Tea and orange slices were empty. I told the manager who was chatting up a girl at the counter and he explained how difficult and time consuming it would be to make more. I suggested it would be worth the wait. The tea was made. The orange slices were not filled. 
I ordered Korean noodles, a spicy dish.  My friend ordered chicken and broccoli with quinoa, a welcomed healthy alternative. 
The Korean dish was nothing more than chicken and noodles with very minimal vegetables drowned in hot sirracha sauce.  It was inedible. I really wanted to return it but given the attitude of the manager, I didn't. 
My friends quinoa was also inedible. It was clearly the worst restaurant quinoa we'd ever tasted. 
My experiences with Pei Wei have been going downhill. This visit cinched it. I think I'm done with Pei Wei restaurants"}
{"text":"Be careful with takeouts! I ordered the Mongolian chicken with lettuce cups and when I got home NO Lettuce cups. I guess I learned to open everything to make sure I received what I ordered. Figured Pei Wei would do that, but guessed wrong!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Pei Wei and I was thoroughly impressed. I had the spicy chicken, my wife had the honey chicken, and both were excellent.

Probably the most surprising was the vegetables. There were pea pods and carrots in the meal and they were perfectly cooked. 

Last but not least, the crab wontons, don't miss them, they are exceptional. More crab than any I've ever had before.

The service here was also impressive. Since it was our first time it took us quite a while to order, and the cashier was very patient and helpful. The table attendant was also great, making sure we had everything, and very friendly. 

Don't know if all Pei Wei's will be this good, but my first experience was excellent."}
{"text":"If you love PF changs, or Americanized chinese food then this is the place for you. 
Flavors were okay nothing amazing. 
Not sure how we ended up here but left this place still asking for more. 
Food was mediocre, not for me though 

Im asian, I should've known better :P"}
{"text":"I like this Pei Wei. The food is always good. The dining room is clean. The cashiers are a bit slow and there will be a big long line and only one cashier, which sucks when you're on lunch and need to get through quickly. Overall I'm happy with this location."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei, but I dislike this particular location. I went to eat dinner with my friend yesterday and the service was not very good. The guy at the register didn't seem to know what he was doing. He was trying to give me my change and was out of pennies. He asked his other two co-workers what he should do ad they didn't seem to know either. I told him don't worry about it because it seemed as if I would be standing there for ages waiting for pennies. We sat down and ate and when we were finished we both had leftovers. Usually at other locations, the employees come and check on you and give you a box. This was not the case here. We sat for almost an hour and no one ever came. We were fine just talking there anyways, but when we were ready to go I went and grabbed my own containers from the counter. The employees were just hanging out at the register talking to each other. Poor service. I won't be back to this location again."}
{"text":"When we checked in they said it would be a 25 minute wait, we were understanding. Over one hour later food still had not reached our table, what a disappointment. After speaking with the manager they did credit our entire bill although still had not received our food. Once the food was received I would say it was decent."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead. Set pickup time and now waiting in parking lot for 30+ minutes.   No apology no compensation no nothing. if you can't get the timing right, don't set the time.  No excuses."}
{"text":"This is by far my least liked location! We love Pei Wei and this one is closer to our house but now I remember why we have been going out of our way to go to the 3rd and Bell location. 

The service is horrible the staff working the phones, desk and takeout are usually young and extremely rude! We usually cannot get through on the phone any sooner then being on hold for over 15 minutes to be then be told the wait is over an hour and half. 

Tonight was no exception! The girls have our order literally overflowing in the smaller bag and as soon as she sat it down our side order of sauce fell to the floor and was leaking everywhere. After looking at her in disbelief she asked if I would like a bigger bag? Ummm of course I do? Why didn't she just place the order in the correct size bag to begin with? Fast forward we get home and the food has zero flavor! Just overall dissapointed and have once again confirmed we will no longer go to this location even if it does mean going out of it way to go to a location further away! 

It's sad cause this was the very first Pei Wei I ever ate at when it first opened but it just isn't the same! 

I honesty think the front end staff could use some training in customer service and the correct way to deal with customers."}
{"text":"This place is quite good. I'm a super fan of their Mongolian Steak. The price is really decent and it's a great spot for lunch. You can order online and they'll let you know when it will be done. Huge time saver when you're on your lunch hour. The soda machine brings my dreams to life with their cherry-vanilla Dr. Pepper. Their chocolate chip cookies are pretty good too. If you come during lunch time, this place gets pretty packed and seating may be a problem. Staff is friendly and I have not had a problem at all at this place. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting in my bathroom throwing up for the past 3 hours after eating this for lunch earlier. Used to eat here all the time, never again. Thanks for giving me food poisoning Pei Wei. Hoping I recover soon."}
{"text":"I love this Pei Wei, Tim the manager makes it a fun place to be.   The Thai dynamite is always good.   I love the black tea.   Mix it up and order the brown fried rice....."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, not any more! Whatever you do, don't use the app unless you are prepared to wait 40 minutes for your order...they said they always do the in house orders first, even though you are sitting there waiting. The food is no longer what it used to be, and they left out a key component to my meal. The fried rice, which costs extra, was awful. All in all, a lousy experience!"}
{"text":"Food taste good but was pretty disappointed by service. Our office placed a order over the phone and when we showed up only half the order was done. They didn't even have the 6 other order ready. The guy at the front taking the order seemed bothered.  So we all decide that they really can't handle big orders at lunch."}
{"text":"Came here with a bad craving for Pad Thai noodles on a Sunday night only to be shut down right away by a very rude little girl at the register.  \"We're looking at a 45 minute wait,\" she said right off the bat, I guess forgetting the standard \"Welcome in!  What can I get for you?\"  
So, thinking of my stomach, I excused her attitude and said \"that's fine, I'll wait.\" I proceeded to order the Pad Thai noodles with chicken.  \"We're all out of chicken,\" little miss friendly replied, somehow forgetting an apology along with it. 
Sigh.
Knowing that this wasn't going to get any better, and knowing that Asian food is basically on every corner, I decided to leave the restaurant (if you can even call it that?  Don't restaurants typically LIKE their customers?) and I went somewhere else. 
Hashtag Pei Wei Fail."}
{"text":"We liked the food and went there twice. The portion is generous compared to the price. The place has a good vibe. The servers are alright. I like their General Tso. We will definitely go there again when we are going to crace for American-chinese food."}
{"text":"They ruined Pei Wei! They actually redecorated to make the place look low rent. Somewhere there's someone in upper management who needs to be fired. Redecorate to downgrade the atmosphere -- seriously? Employees now wear t-shirts and jeans instead of the nice uniforms they wore before. A bunch of teenagers work there instead of the staff that used to know what they were doing.

Worst of all, the new menu sucks. Nothing here that you can't get for half the price at any Chinese take out place in the valley. No more Dan Dan Noodles. No more Lo Mein. No more vanilla chai tea. Now there are just a few rice bowls and no noodle dishes. The music is so loud that you can't even hear them call out your order number as though you were at Taco Bell or McDonald's. Because eating a meal without having to listen to the teenagers at the counter shout out numbers is too upscale. So is actual silverware. Everything that made Pei Wei funky is gone. I guess it is still asian fusion -- it's just a fusion with fast food quality. All that's missing is a drive through.

They do still have tofu, which I appreciate. However, I had Mongolian tofu and the sauce tasted like it was straight out of a jar. The food was barely warm. The mushrooms were raw. My dining partner's portions were laughable. Maybe a half cup of rice and less than a half cup of mongolian beef. 

Yes, I know Pei Wei is a chain restaurant but I used to really enjoy the food. I'm so disappointed. I won't be back."}
{"text":"let me start out with the positive: the service was excellent.  really.  for a restaurant where i order at a counter and THEN sit down, i wasn't expecting much.  but the service staff brought my food promptly, quickly removed my plates, and offered me to-go boxes and a refill.  

unfortunately, i have high expectations for asian food (especially thai food), and i was sadly disappointed by the curry.  so bland.  so so bland.  and the crab rangoon was nothing to write home about either.  

i may consider trying it again if i need to grab a really quick bite, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I eat at Pei Wei frequently and have always been happy until tonight - I ordered the Low Mein and it was awful - unfortunately I got it to go, so I was stuck eating something that was not good at all!  So disappointed - may be  a while before I venture back"}
{"text":"AMAZING place, very good food, and great portions, very filling. I love the style of food, the atmosphere, and the service. They are very quick and prompt, our appetizers came out in a matter of minutes (4 or 5 tops), and the meals came out perfectly after we got done with the opening dish. The only downside to this place I can think of is the selection, while all the meals are very good, the diversity is a little on the low side."}
{"text":"Came in very hungry...not busy at all around 5pm on a Saturday...ordered my usual Pad Thai....and tried the orange chicken for the first time...the cashier/hostess was not very friendly at all...she also did not know how to credit my reward points or ring my order up properly...ask for a cup for water and was given a child cup after spending $18 on my food....as for the food the pad thai was good...the orange chicken was 75% rice...hardly any meat...very different from the downtown location...consistency is key when running a business people...stop having untrained kids taking orders please...so annoying"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time when my family came in from out of town to visit me. I had never been to Pei Wei and had no clue what to expect. We were at the Marshalls that's in the same area and when we passed by, my Mom saw their sign and wanted to eat there. If she wasn't with me, I wouldn't know what the heck to do, not that I wouldn't have figured it out, the layout is just weird.

They have these really tall menus, usually 3 of them, side by side and go from the ceiling to the floor right when you walk in, take a look at what you want then you walk over to the cashier to pay, they hand you a number, pick a place to sit and they'll bring your food over to you. Drinks are self-serve and food is served on dishes and you use sileverware, not paper plates & plastic utensils. I felt like I was at PF Changs by the decor, food and staff but the process of ordering and serving felt like Panda Express.

I ordered the Lo Mein. I have no complaints. The noodles were cooked right, they include whole green onions rather than slicing them up. The size and amount of mushrooms was good, love those! The dish did the job but it wasn't over the top.

Overall satisfying experince, just not mind-blowing enough to where I'd visit much more frequently and to where I can write anymore.."}
{"text":"This Pei Wei recently transformed into a Pei Wei Market. This was our first time trying out the Market and the food still tastes the same but the menu items are more limited. No beef and broccoli - say what?! Luckily they had sweet and sour shrimp. However, it comes on a plastic plate with a plastic tray. You need to grab plastic utensils and drink from a plastic cup. Kind of wasteful if you ask me! Also, the portions were much smaller than before.

The inside is nice. It gives off a warehouse vibe - very clean and open with tons of wood and metal tables. We arrived at 11am and left by 11:20am. The service was super quick - granted we were the first customers of the day! 

One of the employees told us that they were going to change back to a regular Pei Wei, since this Market concept wasn't doing so well. I hope they keep the redesign inside, but definitely go back to the standard menu."}
{"text":"When I moved to Phoenix, Pei Wei was one of the first restaurants I went to and one of my go to places for Asian food. However, over the past 7 years, I have found other places I enjoy and would rather dine at. The food is standard and tastes good, but it isn't fantastic. I like that they are doing lunch specials now, so that helps since the portions can be exceedingly large and not great the next day. This location opened up close to work, so it's easily accessible, which is a plus. We came here a few weeks after the grand opening, but it seemed that all the kinks weren't worked out. While waiting in line, there was only one gal on the register and she was ignoring us in favor of folks who just walked in for Take Away. Finally, a Take Away Customer said to her \"Aren't you going to help them? They were here first.\" She glanced at us, then back to the customer and shook her head no before sighing and finally asking us for our order. Not sure what that was about, but I think they need more employees on the registers, especially at lunch time."}
{"text":"I have always loved this Pei Wei location. Well they just relaunched their app and as part of that launch they are offering  bogo online wed. What a nightmare! I think they may have bitten off more than they can chew. Droves of angry people waiting for their online orders. In addition a line out the door for people wanting to eat inside. They really need to staff for these events! I hope they figure it out soon, but I'll be staying away from Wednesdays for a while."}
{"text":"Why do people go down to Spring Mountain to eat Asian stuff down there?? This stuff kicks that craps ass!!!  It might be more Americanized but its a hell of a lot better. I had the Chili and Lime Shrimp and it was delicious. Best \"Asian Inspired\" meal I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this location. Very helpful staff, and the crab wontons are always delicious. I wasn't so fond of the Asian chop salad, tho. Hence, the 4 stars instead of 5. Food was fast and yummy."}
{"text":"Watching the well choreographed routine of the cooks from the lunch bar is entertaining and educational. Their moves are precise, coordinated, and aesthetically pleasing. They display a harmony of exchanges that is a wonder to behold. The resulting meals are succulent yet prepared to fulfill the desire for instant gratification. 

If only we learn to implement such grace in our own lives, what marvels could we achieve?!

Wonderful choices from around the Asian world. From Korea, Japan, China and much more!

Great for lunch and dinner.  In a rush, not a problem with the smooth ordering process and quick serving time you'll be enjoying your meal before you know it. Plus, they take Apple Pay. 

Lots of parking. Take out available. 

Come for the great food but stick around for some excellent people watching."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Great selection of flavors. You select the staple, pork chicken or shrimp. Choose the flavors from coconut curry to sesame etc. Pick the type of rice, brown or white and the size of your plate. Delicious and under $15 with large portion of nice sized  shrimp,  2 appetizers and a drink."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a pretty good option for some (fairly) quick Asian fare, but don't expect your food anytime soon between the hours of noon and 1:30 p.m. unless you've ordered ahead online.  That place is a mad house.  All of us Ballantyne Corporate Park people who were too lazy to bring our lunches from home saturate this place until its nearly standing room only.

The menu has some decent offerings, but I have to say I'm not a huge fan of their tofu.  It's cut very thin and has a rubbery texture.  They're also a bit too generous on the sauce even with a small portion; I've gotten in the habit of asking for it on the side because usually the dish was swimming in it.

Other than that, it's a decent place to dine."}
{"text":"1st visit had the lo mein...delish!  
2nd visit had the teriyaki...fine if you like salt.  Ick!"}
{"text":"Great takeout service. I love when flames come off the woks.  Cooks back there know how to cook fast. Love it"}
{"text":"We usually enjoy Pei Wei but this location is very dirty.   We arrived for lunch right when they opened and there was food on the floor and under tables from the previous day.  The plate I ate on had a nasty smell so I went to the bathroom to wash my hands.  The pictures of the toilets I took had dried blood down one and the other pink slime in the toilet bowl. This restaurant needs a serious cleaning.   Yuck"}
{"text":"I love the food here when they actually make it right. My family and I come here really often like 1 to 2 times a week. And we always order the same thing and every time they get our order wrong! They each order Thai dynamite with tofu and I order the salad wth tofu. They always burn the tofu and we pay for extra tofu but they don't put it on there. It's really frustrating because the employees aren't helpful and are very rude. When you ask them for something they get bothered and they are slow. They never greet kindly and they always look upset to be working. There is only one girl that is actually nice. I feel like the mangers don't even care because we have addressed this issue to them before and they said they would send us a coupon of some sort and they never did. It would be fine if they got our order wrong once or even twice but they get it wrong every single time! I love their food but they never get it right and have the worst customer service. You don't burn chicken and give it to the customers so why is it okay to burn the tofu?"}
{"text":"Quick and easy take out spot. Their system recognizes your phone number and employees can see your name and last order. So if you want the exact same thing you ordered last time (including customizations), BAM!, it's done and ready for pick up in 10-15 minutes. This works great for my family. Pretty consistent on quality and portion size and customer service is always fantastic.

They offer smaller sizes in addition to the original size portions. Vegetarian (which also happens to be vegan here) sauce options are clearly labeled on the menu. Our favorites are teriyaki and honey seared. 

There is a ton of sugar, fat, and salt in the sauces, but you can make your dish a little healthier by ordering your protein (tofu in our case) stock velvet, which is steamed instead of fried. We also get extra veggies and brown rice instead of white for a little more fiber. Pretty sure eating with chop sticks makes it healthier too.

Wish they'd bring back the veggie lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"This is an easy family take-out spot. They almost always get our order right (check it!), the quality of the food is pretty consistently good, and the customer service is almost always good. They have a few vegan sauces to choose from - nice to have options! Sometimes the sauce is too light or too heavy. There have been a couple of occasions where sloppy food prep lead to cross-contamination (something gross, like chicken, in our food), but the staff is very apologetic and seems to clamp down on quality control when we've reported an issue. Considering how often we get take-out here, we expect some screw-ups. Overall, good stuff."}
{"text":"The smells of Pei Wei always tempt me whether I am shopping for groceries at Sprouts or when I used to work out at the hell hole called LA Fitness. They have some seriously tempting aromas permeating...

I have always had lukewarm experiences at Pei Wei. Some better than others. They have some standard noodle dishes. Nothing to write home about but satisfying nonetheless. 

The last time I went I was excited because I saw advertised that they now sell lettuce wraps. I was thinking if they are anything like the more upscale and much tastier brother restaurant PF Changs lettuce wraps then I was in for a treat. But...

No vegetarian lettuce wraps. Boo! Hiss! Just chicken and beef. How easy would it be to chop up some tofu, give it the same basic seasoning, and serve it up with some iceberg?

SIgh. 

I noticed they have a coconut curry dish. Hmmm... I like coconut curry. Should be good, right? Big mistake vegegirly. I should know better. I am spoiled by authentic hole in the wall Thai restaurants nearby me. 

So I order up coconut curry with tofu and veggies with noodles instead of rice. Bland. Bland. Bland. Yes it has a bit of a dull spicy kick to it. But it lacks the depth of flavor that a GOOD coconut curry should have. Noodles had an unpleasant texture. 

I tasted some noodles from my husbands chicken teriyaki. Good flavor. Should have gotten that. 

Bottom line? Stick to the basics if you are ordering food here."}
{"text":"Here last nite. Disappointed. Ordered via phone for pickup. The good: the phad thai was good and fresh. The bad: the fried rice was bad! I feel it was old not fresh at all. I ordered the rice with shrimp and steak. The shrimp was deep fried? Not sure if that's how it's traditionally done. The rice itself was cold there was no veggies in it. I like pei wei and wanted to try something different bad idea. Fried rice wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"This evening I came for pick up.  Decided a glass of wine and an appetizer to share before we would head home with dinner would be nice.
Apparently something went wrong in the kitchen cuz after about 20 minutes our appetizer was handed to us in the To Go container and the rest of our food order maybe five minutes to completion.  I opted to leave them packed and just take home with the entire meal.  Manager was quick to remedy the situation by breezing by and dropping off a couple of appetizers cards to apologize for the mishap.  He really was apologetic and it was obvious he had the best intentions. They also offered a comp'd Lettuce Wraps for us to dine on while they finished our order but since that was my husbands meal I declined the generous offer and said no thank you.
Mgr did tell me our appetizer was redone and offered them to us again but I figured that since our meal was done I should just take it home so the family gets fed.  
Was super delighted to get home and learn my husbands chicken portion of his ck wraps was not what it was supposed to be.
Ck chunks, bits of corn, and I don't know what else.
So he basically didn't eat Pei Wei tonight and decided or get himself a burger...."}
{"text":"Pro Wei always has good food -- but the WHOLE point of ordering to go is so when you get there after you called it in or ordered online, your food is ready to go!!!! We needed up waiting an additional 20 minutes. What a joke."}
{"text":"It's just above average.  Portions are decent and cost was ok.  Got in and out fast by phoning our order in.  Good was ok, it didn't floor me but it didn't make me not want to there again."}
{"text":"We frequently eat here. Food is always fresh and hot. Employees are very nice and have great customer service. We really like the lady that works the day shift, she is always very welcoming. We enjoy the chicken fried rice, chicken low mein and chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"First time at this location, it was just what we expected. Everything came out hot and fresh. It was clean and employees were friendly. The only complaint is we asked for water cups and the water tasted strange, may want to check the filters."}
{"text":"I wish there was one closer to me.
I've eaten at this location three times when traveling through Charlotte in the past two months. This place is literally the fast food version of PF Chang's, and a bit cheaper. It's actually owned by PFC. 
The portions are just right. I've enjoyed the Mongolian beef and the Sesame chicken. Both are winners! Wash it down with the citrus green tea and you have a (somewhat) healthy meal!
Hopefully they will open a Columbia, SC location. I've eaten at Pei Wei in Denver and Houston as well. All very good!"}
{"text":"On Fathers day a little after 5PM we ordered and paid online. 20 minutes later we walked up to see a hand written sign saying that they were \"closed due to staff shortage\". Since I already paid, I knocked on the window but the staff inside ignored me. They also wouldn't answer my calls. The next afternoon I finally got through after 15 min on hold and Sergio told me that I'd have to drive back to the store (again) to get my refund. He got huffy about it when I told him how inconvenient this had been to me. 

I think I'm getting my refund. No one bothered to try to make up for the inconvenience. Too bad. We used to eat here a lot."}
{"text":"For the last year I have been craving Pei Wei, but today; I finally came around and ate something great. I had brought my significant other and he was not so impressed. He stated \"it's somewhat like a modernized Panda Express\". But he said it was good, no tummy ache! On the other hand, I enjoyed every bit of it! The service was speedy and nice. Yet, the lady who took our order sounded very straight forward. This may sounds crazy but she was like a robot, no emotion! 
Other than that, the food overall was quite delightful. I will definitely be returning. Great size portions."}
{"text":"I yelp therefore I am.....Pei Wei, it's the Mini Me of PF Changs, the Laverne and Shirley of Happy Days, the C class Mercedes Benz of the E Class Benz... I like this place.  I can call ahead from my office and lickety split 3 and half minutes later I have perfectly seasoned, caramelized Mongolian beef and fried rice at the counter faster than you can say cat on a stick.  
In a bigger hurry?  Curbside service rocks as well...  And be sure not to forget the lettuce wraps!  

The only downer? They don't have someone to make the sauce at your table.... but you can't have everything."}
{"text":"Idk it seems like the more expansive Pei Wei's menu gets the more the food suffers. When Pei Wei first started coming up the menu was simple n the food was actually decent. Recently, I'd say the past 2-3 yrs the food has just been mediocre at best. The flavors are murky, smthg is usually over or undercooked, seasoning is off n they have NO business trying to sell ahi tuna (it's not fresh). The prices are on the high side n if u look at my pad thai pic, it's looks day old'ish, which is how it tasted."}
{"text":"Way too much sodium as the body swelling is noticeable.  As the dishes were entered into my fitness app, notices abound of sodium exceeded.  That said, the new ahi bowl was delicious.  The Thai won ton soup bowl, ditto.  The Dan/Dan noodle dish also delish.  But, cut back on the soy/sodium, please, who needs it?  Embrace the fresh flavors.  Great concept restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife called an order in 20 plus minuets prior to my arrival. I waked up to the to go counter and gave the lady my name. She was unable to locate the order initially. Finally she located the order in the pending online order que. At that time she told me it hadn't been sent through to the kitchen yet. So she proceeded to send it though and told Me it would be another 25 plus minute. At that time she offered me a drink while I wait. Is that suppose to be some sort of consolation? What is the point of ordering online if I'm going to have to wait for the order to sent to the kitchen and prepared after I arrive. What a joke. I highly doubt I'll be dining here again in the future."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and the food is always good.

Tip:  Bring a sweater, even in the summer; it's always freezing in there!"}
{"text":"What happened? I haven't been to this location in at least 1 year. I used to love the Kung Pao Chicken. Tonight it was bland with soggy vegetables. This used to have a thicker sauce, was spicy and had plenty of peanuts. Extremely meh. Son tried their new Orange Chicken and said Frys Marketplace makes better Orange Chicken"}
{"text":"Last time we ordered take out ahead of time with about 30 mins remaining before they closed. They were still very good about it even though we were cutting it close when we arrived to pick up our food.

This time we came in to order. They gave us two large cups for drinks while we're waiting. Food smelled amazing. It's pretty clean and the guy that took our order was very pleasant and nice. When I had a question regarding a dish he was knowledgeable enough to answer correctly. That's always good! 

I'm still giving this place a 5 even though all I see is the manager or person in charge just standing at the counter conversing with one of the workers. Terrible image of the place and not professional... All the other locations I've been to, I see management helping or at least not just standing there."}
{"text":"I must order to go about once a month from this restaurant.  Food is always consistent.  Hot. Good.  Great family food.  Kids love it."}
{"text":"Just dont waste your time. They need to figure out how to run this place before I waste my time coming back. Placed on line order then drove and then waited an hour and am writing this review as waiting and still nothing."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible this past Saturday evening.  Took over 35 mins from the time the food was ordered until it was brought to our table. I could have gone to a full service restaurant and had my meal quicker.  I noticed others were waiting a long time and were looking for their food.  And then the chicken in my dish was over cooked and tough.  Noodles were very oily too.  One of the servers was very unfriendly and when I asked about the delay, he didn't even respond to me.  Very poor management.  No one walked around to see how things were going.  Terrible service.  Unlikely that I would return.  Competition is tough for that price range and Pei Wei did not deliver."}
{"text":"A few days ago, a friend suggested we go to Pei Wei for lunch. My comment and rating, after what I discovered, is geared to the Pei Wei corporation and not specifically at this location. I'm trying to lose weight and cut back on my portion sizes, so I thought I'd order the Pei Wei Kids' Chicken Lo Mein. On the first bite, I noticed it tasted \"sweet\" and thought I was imagining things?! In every bite after the first, I tasted \"SUGAR?!\" It was in the sauce at the bottom of the bowl?!? On my way out I walked by where the cooks were preparing food and asked one woman if they put sugar in that specific entree for children. Apparently she didn't speak English and asked another cook in Spanish. The man confirmed what I had suspected--they do indeed put sugar in the Kids' Chicken Lo Mein!!! I told them that was terrible, shook my head and walked away. I HAVE NEVER EVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE HAD \"SWEET\" LO MEIN!!! IT WAS GROSS!!! PARENTS, PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE FEEDING YOUR KIDS!!! GOD FORBID THEY'RE DIABETIC!!! THERE ARE \"16\" GRAMS OF SUGAR IN ONE 4 OUNCE SERVING!!!  SHAME ON YOU, PEI WEI!!!"}
{"text":"As most of us know Pei Wei is a subsidiary of P.F changs. Both are excellent eats; but for the money; I am taking  Pei Wei. The average meal is around 9 dollars; with good size portions. I have gone to many Pei Wei's but for some reason the service here just seems to be a step above the others. I definitely recommend the crab won tons; and te lettuce wraps are truly delicious. Best part is if you want it with more mushrooms or extra spicy; they will accommodate! You can see how I like my Mongolian beef! lol"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for food, 5 stars for decor. 

It's good, not great, but pretty good. I can't seem to find an actual spicy dish. I order the korean chicken extra spicy and it's like, barely spicy. Cmon!

A little expensive, but I also don't go that often. Still trying to find a \"really good\" asian place."}
{"text":"When  we started going to Pei Weis restaurants years ago, we really liked them as a faster, cheaper alternative to PF Changs even though the menu is more limited.  But in recent months I have been disappointed by the food quality and portions of the some of the dishes. But of course the prices have steadily increased. 

On our last outing, we ordered the asian chopped chicken salad and asked for extra chicken. We did takeout and when we got home saw they there was barely any chicken on the salad much less the extra portion that they charged us for. I called them back up spoke with the manager who apologized and prepared another portion of chicken for me to pick up- it's hassle to return to a store to get what you were supposed to get the first time.

Otherwise, I have noticed that their Pad Thai and Rice Bowls have gotten skimpy on the meat as well and the egg rolls are smaller. Overall,  I am not sure what you get is worth the price. You are probably better off at a local Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre! We had Kung Pao chicken. It was supposed to be spicy with vegetables and peanuts. The spice along with the peanuts were not there. Vegetables were sparse. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Fail.
Why? Just compare it to the old restaurant that used to be housed here and that's the only word that comes up. On further thought an acronym comes to mind: WTF"}
{"text":"Great food and great people. Love the Kung pao chicken and the portions. Would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"In town for business and craving for Pei Wei. As always the food does not disappoint . Tasted just as good as back home. This location gets extremely busy so be prepared to wait in line when coming during peak hours."}
{"text":"No surprises here, but this location is very reliable and family loves it.  Coke machines are new favorite.  Fun to make up new concoctions."}
{"text":"The place looks very simple. The guy who helped us order was very friendly and personable. We had some sushi which was fried shrimp with peanuts, would recommend it. 

I had the sesame  dish and I got the fried rise with it, my friend got it without frying his rise. His was horrible and dry,  mine was really good. If you decide to go, get the fried rise version of whatever you order."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times now.  It is close to work, easy parking, and sufficient seating at the busy lunch time.

This past Friday (8/12/16) will be my last for some time.

Cold.  My hot meal should not be cold.

Lids.  I should be able to get a lid for my soft drink.

I can't understand why my food was cold.  I went with 2 co-workers, we ordered at the same time and my food came first (small sweet/sour chicken) so it wasn't waiting at the grill cooling.

There are some things that can always go wrong at a restaurant, but serving a hot dish cold should not be one of them."}
{"text":"For what Pei Wei is...I love this place.  Casual fast dining with great food at a great value.  If you've ever been to P.F. Chang's, this place is owned by the same company and offers similar fare.  

Be prepared to wait during peak hours as this place always does a steady business (at all their locations).  I often call ahead and order take out.  I've had nearly everything on the menu.  The Vietnamese Salad rolls are really light and yummy.  Can't go wrong with the orange peel chicken.  Oh, and the honey seared shrimp is great too...however that one needs to be eaten at the restaurant...it's like an In & Out burger & fries...best eaten ASAP."}
{"text":"In a hella convenient location nestled next door to a Starbucks, and facing McDowell Rd., you really can't go terribly wrong with this Pei Wei.  Of course you have many other opportunities to eat better food in downtown Phoenix, but let's not take away the convenience, location, an early opening time and the fact that a heavy rotation of cops and troopers keep the zombies of 7th Ave at bay.  We've all been to Pei-Wei so I won't describe the food, other than to comment that a every dish seems to be getting increasingly saltier with every visit.  My spicy korean bowl with tofu and vegetables seemed to be positively drenched with salty goo...  perhaps the kindly staff took pity on my tofu-ness and decided to compensate with every tool in their flavor arsenal.  Or perhaps I just was feeling salt sensitive.  Their salads are consistently flavorful and fresh, though I can't say I've ever encountered anything like them on my travels in Asia.  Pei Wei is a successful Arizona invention from the team that started PF Changs so we should be proud of what they get right, and keep them honest on what they get wrong."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei because I love any restaurant that has a #glutenfree menu. However, unlike it's BFF PF Changs, this restaurant has very limited choices for their GF menu. I stick to the sweet and sour chicken. I usually order with extra vegetables and light sauce (the sauce is a bit intense). I also get the edamame. Seriously, I miss the crab wontons more than I miss bread. They JUST started offering #glutenfree soy sauce (tamari) packets! HOORAY PEI WEI! 

BUT this restaurant gets a 3-star review (honestly a 3.5) because of the AWFUL PARKING LOT. Add 10 minutes to your destination to drive around the small parking lot if you want a close spot - OR - park in the SE corner behind the antique mall and walk over. Also, the patio is great to sit at, but there's a big pigeon problem. They'll attack your food if you let them!

I always get to-go here and it's usually pretty decent. Today they a) gave me the wrong meal in my to-go bag and I had to call and ask them to come out and exchange my meal. However, when I got back and opened up the to-go container, they had forgotten the extra vegetables I requested. MAKE SURE you check what you're getting to-go, especially if you are #glutenfree!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3-stars because Pei Wei is what it is. It's not PF Changs. BUT It does offer some gluten-free selections, which is all I can really ask for in a restaurant. 

I always get the gluten-free sweet & sour chicken, and they have a non-GF breading on the chicken that's pretty legit. You can also ask for the edamame to be GF - which means they cook it separately from the other edamame (although don't ask me what it's cooked in). I wish they had more to offer on the menu, especially the dessert offerings like PF Chang's. 

There's always 4-5 parking spaces reserved for pick-up orders, which is good because that parking lot gets SUPER full with Pita Jungle in the same area."}
{"text":"Location is great because it's in Summerlin and next to Red Rock Casino where I play so if I'm in mood for Pei Wei I will come here. I ordered a dan dan noodle to go. It came out pretty quick. I really like how they put the bean sprouts and fresh sliced cucumber in the dan dan noodle. There was chicken in mine. I would say the sauce needs a little more flavor and spice. It lacked seasoning or flavor to me. And the dan dan noodles I've had in the past at Pei Wei locations are a bit spicier as well. Overall I would say just improve on the flavor of the sauce and the dish would be good. Location was clean. The girl at the counter took my order and I'm glad it was quick."}
{"text":"This particular Pei-Wei always seems to be busy and it's pretty loud.

I like that the food is rather ecclectic and there is an abundance of variety. I haven't every been disappointed with their food and it's a solid choice for a short get together with friends, aside from the noise, that is. 

It's just okay by me."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Pei Wei fan since 2007 and have dined at their locations across the country. This location is BY FAR the worst in terms of speed of service and being on top of their game. I moved to Las Vegas back in October and this Pei Wei is very near my home. I like to order online and pick up my order on my way home. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt the first few times, but I am about fed up with this location. I'm wondering if their parent company's recent financial woes and restructuring have affected all of their stores. I did notice that they've done away with the plastic cups used for dine-in beverages and have gone exclusively to disposable paper cups.

My main \"beef\" with them is the fact that today I placed my online order at 5:33 and received a confirmation that my order would be ready by 5:55. My order is normally ready at other locations WELL before the promised-by time, however this location's sloppy staff just doesn't get it.

Today I received my order at 6:05, more than 30 minutes after placing my order. Some might say I am being way too picky, but it is all about pleasing the customer, and this location falls short of this consistently. The staff is ever changing (including management), so I'm not sure what the story is here.

The food quality is still good, however I noticed today I had no condiment bag with my order that usually contains sauces and fortune cookies. It looks like Pei Wei is cutting back, and that is not what I would expect from this chain.

I hope corporate will take a look at this fledgeling location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat  and in a good location.  Although a few times  we've had to wait for a long time until all the plates are on our table. Bad timing, you don't want to start eating when someone in front of you is still waiting for his plate. And they might give you too little sauce  on your teriyaki bowl. Ask for extra. I like the beers they carry."}
{"text":"Clean, quick, tastes great, priced just right, no complaints from me!"}
{"text":"My bid it started out fantastic for lunch there was no line. I ordered and the clerk did not ask me for my frequent flyer card. When I said I wanted to use my number I had already paid so she could not do it and said you must go online. Things went downhill from there the water was a gray color and one machine I sat down at the table on my arm stuck to it and looking around very few of the tables were wiped down between visitors I love they ways food and this was good this time but they really need to work on your service and cleanliness"}
{"text":"We got take out like we normally do and the manager rudely said everything was in the bag. Come to find out when we got home it wasn't. When we called he was even more rude and said he was still right. Well you weren't."}
{"text":"When we moved from Roseville, CA to Phoenix I was very happy to find out that the Pei Wei's here were still open.  Unfortunately all the Pei Wei's in California shut down over a year ago and I lost out on quick good Chinese food that is very similar to PF Chang's (same owner).  The only issue out here in Phoenix is that they have dulled down the food for some reason.  My favorite dish is the Mandarin Kung Pao Chicken, but I have to remember to ask for it to be spicy, which is crazy.  You should have to ask for it to be less spicy, it's Kung Pao for crying out loud.  Anyhow, I've also noticed this at PF Chang's where I have to ask for the spicy dishes there to have the heat increased.  Also the Crab Wontons rule along with the spicy plum sauce.  My only problem is that the two locations closest to me are not that close and are about equidistant from where I live so I can't stop and pick some up on the way home like I did in Roseville.  Still glad they are here though."}
{"text":"As a lower-cost, quicker version of its parent, P.F. Chang's, it's hard to beat Pei Wei for the quality and price.
In three years of eating here, I've never had a bad meal, and the entire menu is great.
Clean, friendly staff, great cooks ... you can't go wrong if you're looking for a quick bite or don't feel like cooking dinner after a long day at work.
Try the Thai Dynamite chicken!"}
{"text":"The old menu is back!  

Many thanks to corporate and to all the other people who either complained or stopped going.  We used to go at least once a week, but the new concept had really turned us off, and I'd say we went a total of 4 times since the switch, half of,those times paid by gift cards from corporate.  

No more disposable plates and silverware, but good ole china!  Best of all, I can get my old favorites and a bowl of Lo Mein for my son.  

So while the food and restaurant may not actually be five stars, I'm giving it to them for returning the Pei Wei universe to the correct order.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I think Pei Wei is delicious. My favorite, although it isn't the most \"authentic\" is chicken pad thai. I only go to this location for lunch, as bossman loves their teriyaki, and it's nearby. I always order online and for take-away. The food has always been consistently good. These, though, are the reasons I don't like location: A) Parking is horrible during the lunch rush. Even with the dedicated spaces for to-go orders, I sometimes have to park at the other end of the lot. I think some people abuse those special parking spots! And B) The order is never usually ready by the time stated on the online order. Most times I wait about 5 minutes past. The staff is always friendly and until they do something horribly wrong, I won't stop my patronage!"}
{"text":"Well gave this place another chance on an online pick up order for my family and I. Disappointed yet again. One chicken dish was made wrong and the extra dressing I had requested was never put in the bag, not to mention they didn't even put the correct dressing in the bag that usually goes with the chopped chicken salad. This is the first time I've had an entree made wrong so I'm not upset about that. The problem is that the girls packing everything always seem to forget something or don't put in extras as asked. I know I should have double checked at the restaurant but I had hope everything was there when it wasn't."}
{"text":"Place rocks!

It IS a bit more $$ then ur usual Asian joint but its really good and portions are rather large. You do order your food yourself at the counter, get your number and find yourself a seat you like. I do not see anything wrong with that, do you? No longer then a few minutes they bring out your food to your table. And ... Yummm.. Yummm its good.

Good lil' joint.

\"I like\"

Eugene"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Thai Dynamite with brown rice and extra chicken to go. As you can guess there was barely any chicken and the rice was white. It's like the chef didn't even read the ticket. The green onions that were in both dishes looked like they ripped the onion out of the ground and chopped off the green part. I have been coming here for a while and this was probably my last time. 

It seems like the quality and taste of the different dishes has gone downhill recently. Maybe they are trying to deter people because their parking lot is so small. This might work."}
{"text":"Yes this is a chain, oh well. Wei has a good selection of options and the food is always fresh.

Service at this location (which is new to me) is always prompt and courteous. 

It's Asian food from a chain so don't expect to be blown away but is this really why anyone goes here? It's consistent as you can get and doesn't break the bank for a good portion of food that can also be relatively healthy.

My only qualm with Wei is that many of the dishes taste alike. Whether I get the Thai Dynamite or the Spicy Korean the flavors, spices don't vary that much - both are still decent dishes though.

At 878 walkable yards from our place it's the closest Asian food takeout we have and I am ok with that."}
{"text":"If you rate a restaurant based on how often you visit it then Pei Wei gets five stars.  Seriously, I eat at Pei Wei at least twice a week because I enjoy it so much.  The food is high quality, inexpensive, and fast.  In addition, the place offers a nice Asian décor different from all the other restaurants out there.  I generally do not like cash register style restaurant where you wait in line to place your order and then try your best to find an available table; however Pei Wei makes it work exceptionally well.  Rarely am I in line long and rarely am I unable to find an available table.  That being said, the place can get a little crazy on Friday and Saturday nights so expect somewhat of a loud and bustling place if you go on those nights. I generally do not like loud busy restaurants, but in this case, it suits the theme they have going.  I am actually entertained by the action in the open kitchen and the comings and goings of people.  It's a hip little place to chow down.  I would put Pei Wei's food up against any so called \"fine dining\" Asian restaurant any day.  So many times my wife and I find ourselves paying the bill after eating at some fancier Asian restaurant only to say to one another, \"Pei Wei is better at half the price.\"  I especially appreciate the fact that they provide a gluten free menu along with half portions and brown rice for some healthier options. Way to go Pei Wei!  See you tonight!

PS, I only gave Pei Wei four stars because I believe five stars should be reserved for true five star dining experiences at higher class upscale restaurants; however within the fast food category, Pei Wei gets five golden stars from me."}
{"text":"We visit here periodically and tend to enjoy the food. Service always seems a challenge here.  Getting to the part where you can start to eat the meal seems to be difficult for this location. When ordering the entree and request extra Asian slaw with it, you expect there to be slaw on it as well as extra on the side. When you request a side of pickled ginger, you expect to receive it. When you order appetizers then entrees, you expect appetizers first, before the entree. When the server spills the edemame salt on the table next to you and it lands on you and your clothes, you expect an apology and offer to clean it up. In this case, my wife and I ordered the same entrees except hers was supposed to have extra slaw on the side...then the aforementioned events occurred. 

I hesitate recommending this location because of the inability of the staff to get the order correct the first time."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. My husband really dislike this place but since I kind of enjoyed my meal here, I decided to come back again and drag him. The past couple of trips had been really horrible. No wonder my husband hates coming here. Service at the register had been really bad. This last trip I asked the cashier how big the regular portion is. I was expecting she'd show a to go container to give an idea or just explain it, ex. Good for two, more than enough for me that I can take the rest home, etc.. Instead, she pointed at an advertising flyer on the counter which the plate on the picture literally looked like it was only 3 1/2 inches big. Lol insane customer service! How do these people get a job in customer service! Also my husband pointed the fact that the menu says fresh cut chicken breast but doesnt say breaded. He got a chicken breast dynamite and it was just literally heavily breaded chicken. I hardly paid attention to the menu since I've always gotten tofu in small sized entree. He got a regular size which he thought would come with more chicken, rather it came with double the rice. Insine lol I can't help but just crack up. Well for sure we're never going back."}
{"text":"Canceled our lunch order without notice or reason as it was being picked up. Waste of time for everyone involved, and it looks like this is a recent trend at this location so I would steer clear of this Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Are you ppl out of your minds??? This place is so sticky just literally stepping foot into this place. I had to come in and pick up an order for someone else and my shoes stuck to the floor. Imagine what it's doing to your Insides!  And the staff I experienced were not built for customer service . Awful experience will not put myself through that again"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite restaurants now if you want your food cooked a certain way don't Rely on this to happen the last three times I have asked for my beef to be extra crispy and they don't seem to know what that is very disappointed also Got fried rice and there was more lumps of white boiled rice and fried rice"}
{"text":"I had a really disappointing meal, and I see I'm not the only one. I had the worst potstickers and sushi ever here."}
{"text":"I don't really know where to begin here, but the bottom line is that our most recent visit of today was perhaps the worst visit we have ever had at Pei Wei in general.

We arrived around 6:15pm and as usual, it was pretty busy which was to be expected. No problems there. What was the problem was that once we finally had an opportunity to get up to the register and complete our order, quite literally EVERY indoor table was in need of being bussed clean. The outside wasn't much better to be honest. It took the better part of 20 solid minutes before anthing was cleared by the staff. It was bad enough that customers were clearing their own tables. That's totally ridiculous and the fact it got to that point before any staff took action says that either they don't have enough staff on tonight, they're apathetic about it, or the manager on duty doesn't care enough to do anything about it.

When our egg rolls finally showed up, they were only marginally warm but still warmer than the attitude of the server who brought them to us. I don't have much confidence in our main dishes to this point, but I guess we'll sit here and hope for the best.

It seems that Pei Wei has gone down in terms of quality since breaking with PF Chang's. What a bummer."}
{"text":"We eat here on occasion - once per month at the most. The service is always good. I usually order the Ahi Avacado Salad. This last time, however, it didn't seem that any of the wasabi dressing had been placed on the salad (and I didn't ask for it on the side, or to be left off the salad)."}
{"text":"For the price you can't beat this place. Fresh, made to order Asian style food. Lunch specials starting at $6.95! One of the best deals in town in my opinion. And for you PF changs fans, this is a great place to enjoy similar items at a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  My hubby placed an online order this weekend and went in to pick it up.  I chose something that sounded good but I did not realize it was spicy.  I like spicy.  While the initial flavors of the dish were good the spice was out of control.  It literally was burning as it went down and gave me terrible indigestion afterward.  My husband also chose a spicy dish and it was nowhere as spicy as mine.  Also after eating a few bites I felt the sauce had way too much ginger.
My kids ordered sweet and sour chicken.  Very little chicken to the order.
I understand the convenience but you're better off just getting takeout from a standard Chinese place"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a good, fast casual chain restaurant. I had the Dan Dan noodles and they were good! Totally satisfying comfort food. Noodles with a slightly spicy sauce with ground chicken. The sprouts and cucumber added a fresh crunch. 

We also got the Mongolian beef with brown rice and the kid's sweet and sour shrimp. All good! With fountain drinks it came to about $30. I also like that you have the option of white or brown rice. 

Yes, Pei Wei is corporate and not always super authentic, but it still has some tasty options!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. The first few times were good but the last two times my food order has been wrong. The staff don't seem to care. Crazy but service is really just as important as food quality when it comes to restaurants"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great food & very clean :) this is definitely one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"I visit Pei Wei's once a week and this is probably my last visit, they have changed the way they cut the chicken to save cost and is cut way too thin so it is over fried.  Some pieces are so hard to eat, way too crunchy with little meat.  Tried 2 other locations and same result."}
{"text":"Cannot believe I haven't eaten here before! 

Like the food here MORE than PF Chang's down the street from this. 

Food is so good and so reasonably priced. They have healthy options such as tofu and brown rice. We went there at 8 pm on a Sunday to dine-in, and the service was so fast. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Cashier girl with glasses working on 6/26/18 was rude, looked like she hated her job, good food though"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has so many low reviews lately; we received some gift cards for PF Changs/Pei Wei over the holidays and decided to try out Pei Wei. I use to order take out from Pei Wei frequently when I lived in Orange County and I have to say it is still pretty darn good! 

In my opinion it is basically the same food that you get at PF Changs at a fraction of the price. We ordered the Mongolian Beef with Noodles, Honey Seared Chicken with Brown Rice and the new General Tsao's with White Rice. All the proteins and vegetables were cooked to perfection and everything was tasty. I will have to say the General Tsao's was a spicy (and I like spice), so if you are not a fan of spice definitely do not order that one. 

It took about 10 mins after my food was suppose to be ready for it to be ready when I arrived, but the staff was friendly and had it to me as fast as they could on a busy Monday night.

Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Normally, we are very satisfied by ordering 30 min ahead and picking up, but not tonight. The phone system put me on hold for about 25 min, so I decided to drive to the location on Raintree. When I arrived I voiced my complaint to the 15 year old working the counter. After he had tome to look up from his phone and give me no eye contact. I told him about my experience and he said \" we have no control over it.\" He rang in my order, took my money and that was it. Terrible customer service. I hope the food isn't as bad as the customer service. Too many more tones like this and we won't be eating at Pei Wei anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered teriyaki chicken bowl via phone to pick up and bring home.  Flavor was great but the chicken was dry and over cooked.  Called Pei Wei after got home, manager said do you want to re-order, I said \"no\" already was home, so he said \"dinner is on us, and will talk to cook about the chicken\".  So otherwise I'll probably return since their food is fresh, just check the chicken next time!"}
{"text":"The knock off by PF Chang's!

Great food, but more moderately priced then their upscale sister restaurant.  

You MUST have their edamame...delicious!  All the food is consistently good and fixed fast.

The serving staff at this location is always very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Came here with my younger cousin, didn't know where to eat at. We ended up here at Pei Wei hearing from friends that it was good. 

The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, I can picture it being a bit loud when business picks up. The seating for this place is big.

Staff was nice and had a warming smile when being greeted. Cashier helped out with ordering since it was my first time here. They all seem busy doing something when no helping customers.

I ordered the Beef Lo Mein and crab wontons. The beef lo mein was decent. The noodles and veggies were awesome as for the beef it was a bit dry. As for the crab wontons it's not as good as other yelpers say, but that's just me. For an appetizer I received the wontons after my meal which was weird.   


All in all I give this place a three and a half stars overall. I will be coming back again to try out their other items. Who knows maybe my rating will change when i come back again. ^_^"}
{"text":"Been here once or twice in the past several years. Felt like Asian but wanted something fast. 
Tonight I ordered take out. The Mongolian Steak with rice was pretty good. Smokey flavor. Not super tender meat, but pretty good. However the Pad Thai was a bad joke. Not rice stick noodles. The chicken was strangely unappetizing, large chunks of white meat breast. Imitation flavor, way too sweet, no fish sauce, it tasted like it contained soy sauce. There is no soy in Pad Thai. I threw half of it out. It shouldn't be on the menu. The wok entree was much better. I'd give that 3 stars."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night. The orange peel chicken with brown rice was good and met expectations. The thai beef salad could have been much better. The beef was cooked in a wok, but it was overcooked IMO, very crisp, and dry. The salad dressing almost tasted like Italian. The flavor of the mangos got overwhelmed by the vinegary dressing. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't flavored like a typical Thai beef salad or papaya salad. 

I'm seeing a pattern to Pei Wei. I like their wok items, but their Thai food doesn't hold up. I guess I don't appreciate fusion. The orange peel chicken gets 3 stars, the Thai Beef Salad was 2 stars. I will be generous since the service was pretty fast."}
{"text":"If I could give it ZERO stars I would !! Lets just start off by saying we were on an hour wait for pick up & when we arrived in 45min our food was already finished and sitting out for god knows how long ....we had 4 orders, 2 of which were Mongolian beef both had a hair in them !! We also ordered Spring Rolls that weren't even fried/baked however they make them but they were white ...not even crispy & last but not least my meal had the peel/skin of a garlic clove that was mixed in with my mushrooms  We've been coming to this location for some time now & this time 'round we did not enjoy our meal and will most likely not return !!! Grotesque!"}
{"text":"Like it's big brother PF Chang's, Pei Wei really isn't anything special. I'm always perplexed by the way a lot people rave about it.  I eat at this location once in a great while because it's very close to work. I can order food online, and the amount of time it takes to get to my car and drive over is exacly the time it's supposed to be ready. But the truth about all these chain Asian places is that pretty much every meal tastes similar, and nothing is all that great. Overall, it feels like a slightly higher quality version of fast food. 

I ordered the Orange Peel Chicken. It has a little bit of a kick from chili peppers, but to label it as \"spicy\" on the menu is a joke. The sauce was okay, but like I said earlier, nothing spectacular. Like most chains, it kind of has that \"out of box\" taste. 

I'll give Pei Wei credit for good prices and portion sizes. I also love that brown rice is an option. The online ordering is also convenient and easy. The people who work at the take out counter are quick and friendly (although they never put napkins in the bag unless you ask, that should be standard). Pei Wei is the definition of A-OK, but if I'm looking for more than a quick meal, there's too many good local Asian restaurants that are worth checking out first."}
{"text":"Why, oh why, do I aways give a Pei Wei another try?  Probably because the prices aren't bad, the menu looks like it should be excellent, and the quality of the food isn't that bad considering the restaurant is quick service.  But, having said that, I never leave a Pei Wei fully satisfied, and this location is no exception.

My girlfriend and I both ordered off the \"Low Fare Dinner Menu.\"  To make a long story short; you can save a few dollars by getting less of the protein, more rice than I can eat, and a small side.  I had Honey Chicken with brown rice and a spring roll.  My girlfriend had Mongolian Chicken with brown rice and a spring roll.  It should be hard to complain for just $6.25 each, but the food wasn't very good.  The Honey Chicken (which was quite flavorful) only came with five or six bite sized pieces of chicken, and the Mongolian Chicken was so over sauced that the rest of plate had no other taste.  The spring roll wasn't anything that couldn't be microwaved from out of our freezer, and I got bored of the rice.

The only saving grace to this meal was spending less than $20.00 on dinner for two."}
{"text":"The lettuce wraps alone would be a 10 star review. Unfortunately when it comes to Pei Wei, I've yet to really have anything else at any location that's blown me away. Wei Pei is about as standard as Americanized Asian food gets. It's just prepared here in quicker manner than full service chain restaurants, and usually in a better manner than fast food Asian restaurants. 

I went because my girlfriend had a craving for the lettuce wraps. While a few better places have similar wraps to Pei Wei and PF Chang's, I'll give these two chains credit for having the best. We jokingly said before ordering our meal that we should just have gone with two orders of the wraps. Ironically enough, we were right. We also Order Chicken Lo Mein. When I took the first taste, I was shocked to taste pretty much nothing. When my girlfriend took a bite, she realized it was sauceless. She then asked one of the \"servers\" (I don't know a better term for guy who brings food you ordered from counter to table and cleans off plates but didn't take your order) for some. We tossed it into the noodles and it made a big difference, but it still was a rather plain and boring version of a popular Chinese dish."}
{"text":"I have eaten at pei wei before and the food was decent. Today i went in to order take out. The service i got was great! However,  tried the chicken chow mein for the 1st time and it wasnt good. I will never order this again.
I think i need to stick to real chinese food."}
{"text":"I placed two orders on line one last Thursday 3/8/18 @ 6 10 pm for a 6:45 pm pick up; when I got to the location, it was standing room only in the take out line.  I stood in line for more than 5 minutes to pay and then another 15 minutes for my order...... There was no coordination amongst the team and they just looked lost as it was busy.

I placed an order for tonight for soup and crab wontons at 5:50 pm for pick up at 6 10 pm (a very simple order) when I got to the location @ 6:10 pm; the place was in disarray, the printer system was not working therefore, the cooks had no clue what orders were coming in. The \"manager\" was truly stressed out, yelling at the cooks as well as the to go team, and letting everyone in the restaurant now that it was going to be about 45 minutes before the orders will be ready (so sad).

I have been in the food industry for over 35 years so I understand how restaurants work and I know that when s**t, hits the fan and systems go down you need to keep your coold and go back to the days when you had to handwrite your orders to ensure your guests orders were placed the right way without screaming at your team or belittling them for one salad....

One would think that Pei  Wei would have systems in place for when any part of the location goes down from the back of the to the front of the house.

Will not return to this location,its just waste of time......"}
{"text":"A nice fast food style restaurant with good food. I had the Kung Pow Chicken and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"visiting a friend in scottsdale we stopped here on the way to spend \"football saturday\" with her family...she likes this place said it was usually quick, full of flavor and easy to get to on the way to her parents.

I definitely had to agree it definitely was pretty tasty chinese fast food. the noodle dish i ordered was full of flavor and spicy...which to me is always a plus.  the next time i visit AZ, i'll probably be making another stop here.

only flaw was the staff, i know it was a slow time, saturday midday, but you could look a bit more friendly..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  We waited forever for our food, and when it did arrive it was cold.  About half the tables were empty, and NOT ONE table had been cleaned.  There were no clean forks ( difficult to eat rice with chopsticks).  Very poorly run restaurant, this will be my last visit."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been to this location literally dozens of times since they've opened.  We've eaten in, we've taken out.  This time, since an errand called us away during dinner prep time, we called the order in on the way back.

Got there about 10-15 minutes after we called the order in, and it was ready to go for us right when we arrived.  There was a slight snafu in paying...I have a PF Chang 'Emperor's Card' which gives the holder 10% off at PF Chang...we had also been told that it was good at Pei Wei.  Apparently it is not accepted there.  Which isn't that much of a problem...expect that it took 5-10 minutes for them to figure it out.  The person helping me called another store (or someone) to verify and before she did I told her that it wasn't a big deal, I didn't want to have to wait 5-10 minutes just for $1-$2.  She assured me it would be quick...but to me it wasn't.  Not a huge deal, but definitely not optimal.

Got home with the food, lettuce wraps and honey seared chicken with brown rice is a perfect sized meal for the two of us, and usually we have some leftovers.  Everything was good, as per usual, though they never pack enough lettuce cups, that is kind of annoying.  

Solid four stars for Pei Wei, the food is always delicious, the service is always good (even with the wait this time, it was still good service and friendly).  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"New decor but something is missing!  

Not so upscale Asian fast food any longer.  You order at the counter and wait to hear your number shouted out for you to pickup.  Sort of like McDonalds.

Servers who deliver your food to the table are no longer. No one  is clearing off empty dishes or asking if they can get you anything.  Heck, even Dairy Queen will bring out the Blizzard to your table on occasion.  At Pei Wei's you're on your own now, buddy!    

What happened to the nice china plates and silverware.  Now it is plastic boats for the food and cardboard (huh) boxes for the salads. 

Menu has changed to what seems like smaller portions. My buddy's favorite sweet and sour soup is gone.  In fact Pei Wei's has no soups now.  The Pei Wei spicy beef was still good if somewhat vinegary.  Difficult to eat the side salad from the small cardboard box.

Granted the remodel makes for an attractive space!  But it's now just open seating, sort of like mall eateries.  Music was irritating too.  

I don't think this place will appeal to older folks. Previously Pei Wei was 5 star for me but now I'll think twice about eating here.  I like Sauce, down the street a whole lot better, as in better caring service!"}
{"text":"Food is decent besides the incredibly small serving sizes. & Service is TERRIBLE. Very rude, very careless."}
{"text":"We ordered the shrimp lo mein and beef and vegetable dish. The lo mein has horrible, bland, no flavor even with extra sauce. The vegetables with the beef were raw. I never had such bad food at any other pei wei before"}
{"text":"I stopped in here to order take-out for myself and my boss. Parking at this corner is very limited, so prepare for that!

The restaurant was busy with the lunch rush, but the wait in line wasn't too bad (the women working the registers were not wasting time). The menu seems to have changed since the last time I've been to one of these locations - my boss wanted the Chicken Lo Mein, but it is no longer on the regular menu (only on the Kids Menu). I ordered the Chicken Chow Mein for her and the Hot and Sour Soup for myself.

The take-out order was prepared in a decent amount of time and the women working the desk made sure I knew where to find utensils and sauces. The transaction was quick and easy.

Both dishes met our expectations and were good portion sizes for the price. I've never had a complaint about Pei Wei and still do not. Great and easy stop for lunch or a casual dinner!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love, love, love Pei Wei's food most of the time, but it's the staff I feel is lacking a bit. Every time I've come in it seems they'd rather talk to each other and help the person trying to order. It's very clean and bright which I love. I usually don't have to wait too long unless I'm ordering takeout. The best dishes I've had are the sweet n sour chicken, any of their sushi, and the spicy ramen. They'll even make it hotter if you ask which my husband loves. A family of six can get pretty pricy so if you're looking for cheap this probably isn't for you."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus score I would. I came here with my family and we all ordered and I ordered a hot and sour soup. The meals came out one at a time for the rest of my family. My family began eating thinking that my soup would be on the table shortly. As they were 3/4 of the way done with their food my sister-in-law got up and asked our waitress what happened to my soup. Apparently they didn't have the soup. The waitress did not tell me this. The cashier did not tell me this. It took my sister-in-law to get up and go ask. And then when the waitress did come over and tell me it was only because my sister-in-law made her.   

There were no apologies made. Horrible service. All the way around. And yes I filled out the survey and was quite honest. One of the questions of the survey was, \"would you like someone to call you about this? \". I indicated \"yes I would\".  That was four days ago and I've still not received the call. 

Terrible"}
{"text":"Amazing service and management! All of the employees there are friendly and helpful. Also, the kitchen looks really clean!"}
{"text":"Decent customer service but the food was awful. It was cold and had no sauce at all. I was expecting it to be good but this place really went down hill. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I really like Pei Wei's food but this location is always inconsistent.  I have never actually eaten in the restaurant which is probably a good thing because I would have sent back half of the orders I placed.  The very first time I got take out from here, it was perfect.  The food was awesome.  No complaints.  The second time I got take out, I received the wrong order and was simply too lazy to drive all the way back to the restaurant to exchange it.  Fast forward to yesterday...I got my take out order and when I got home tore into it since I was hungry like the wolf (any Duran Duran fans out there?)  The rice was all clumpy which has never happened before, and mixed in with the caramel chicken were vermicelli noodles (almost as if the chicken was accidentally placed into the noodles and then the chef realized my order was supposed to be with rice).  Just weird.  
Pei Wei- get your stuff together so I can go back to enjoying getting take out from you!  Your food is delish but your peeps need some remedial training.  
On the flip side, the order takers are always polite and pleasant."}
{"text":"Hands down, the worst Pei Wei I've been to.  The service is \"meh\" at best, and 45 minutes for a to go order to be ready is just unacceptable.  
I love the concept of this place.  Restaurant quality food in a fast food setting.  Normally I get my staple Caramel Chicken and it's absolutely delicious.  I often get edamame or a sushi roll as well so I have leftovers for lunch the next day.  I have honestly never received anything from this location that is even remotely close to \"great.\"  I don't know what it is. I wish these guys could get their stuff together and make some decent food again so I can go back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location for Take Out last week.  The restaurant was located on W Charleston Blvd near the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas.  I have been to a Pei Wei's in Denver a couple of times and have liked it.  I had an internet coupon for BOGO.  

I ordered the Thai Coconut Chicken and the Broccoli Beef.  I specifically asked for the broccoli to be undercooked and the gal said that they always cook it that way.

The Thai Coconut Chicken had tender slices of white meat chicken.  It was okay.

The Broccoli Beef had yellow (old) pieces of overcooked broccoli and tough pieces of beef.  The rice was soaked with oily sauce.

I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally taste Pei Wei!  Unfortunately it made me so sick, I was neither able to finish my meal and had to trash my leftovers.  Unless you have an iron stomach, they should serve their food with a complimentary roll of toilet paper! You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Ensure you check your order. They have messed my food up multiple times and caused me to sit and wait there."}
{"text":"Had two orders, one for honey chicken with brown rice and another for orange chicken with fried rice, wantons and pork rolls. The second order was not completed correctly and arrived as chicken fried rice and pork rolls with wantons. The food was mediocre at best. The service was good and the waiter offered to fix the order for free. The honey chicken left much to be desired as did the rest of the food. 1 star in that it was edible and 1 star for the offer to fix the mistake."}
{"text":"3 stars for foods 2 non stars for staffs.
I understand you have rough day but if you work as a customer service you should know that atleast give a smile and be friendly. Staffs attitude makes the restaurant bad."}
{"text":"I have been to this Pei Wei multiple times and it never fails I am always disappointed! I have dined in and they lose my ticket and I have to show my receipt to get my food. For take out they forget my sauces and utensil and just tonight I called to order take out the girl was very rude and it was an hour and a half wait! My recommendation go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I admit: I come here often.  Close to my house, easy weeknight pick up meal.  But since their remodel and new menu, the food now stinks on a grandiose level.  Royal fail."}
{"text":"I came here after work today to do carry out. I only come here for one item and that's the Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls. They are addicting and filling even though it only comes with three rolls. These have chicken,lettuce, fresh mint, carrots, peanuts ,rice noodles, with a taste of lime vinaigrette rolled in a rice wrapper. It comes with sweet chili sauce and Thai peanut sauce on the side. My personal favorite is the peanut sauce. 
I enjoy doing carry out because it's ready for me to pick up right after work. When I call in my order it's quick and fast because by my phone number they can tell what I ordered last time. I was recently made aware that they also have a frequent diner card there too. I just started using it today so I don't know their point system. If it means every once in a while I can get these rolls for free then I'm in!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Third time we have tried to eat in this place in a month!   guy working front counter tells everyone that its 25-45 minute wait!  Seriously  4 tables eating already  2 tables waiting on food and the n 3 tickets hanging on the togo prep area!  WHAT'S UP?    WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF IT WAS BUSY???   OMG I HAVE WATCHED 6 parties of 3 or 4 leave because he said there is  a wait 40 min.  Fire this guy!! 
This place wont make it if he keeps this up"}
{"text":"This is the best location for this chain.  I have been here several times. The food is consistent, served hot and the employees are always pleasant....not so much at the Indian school rd location. I like to get the orange chicken. They do a great job with this dish. Lettuce wraps are spot on with a generous portion. Of course they serve coke products."}
{"text":"Rude service, acted like we were bothering them
At the register.  Help at the tables very nice. Food was very good."}
{"text":"The second star is a gift, primarily because the food was prepared quickly and ready at the promised time. Beyond that, it was very disappointing. This was the first time I tried this Pei Wei location after realizing it was actually the closest one for me. I generally get the same order when I eat at Pei Wei, the Honey Seared Chicken with some shrimp added, light sauce. The locations at Gainey Ranch & S. Tempe do a great job, but I think this time someone might have been offended by the 'light sauce' request and decided to change it to 'drowning in sauce' instead. The meat was practically liquified from all of the sauce there was so much. Also, there was barely any chicken or shrimp to begin with - it was a plate of brown rice with a clump of goo in the right corner of the dish that contained significantly less chicken/shrimp than what I'd come to expect after consistently ordering this exact dish at those other two locations for years. Next time I think I'll drive a few extra miles to Gainey Ranch."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoons at one require more than one cashier. Lined up customers for dine in, and a growing line for pick up and take out. A tad dysfunctional. Wound up @ Tokyo express..."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat in Arrowhead. I've been here at least 30 times but this is my first review??!!!??!?  Ha

Anyways anything on the menu is good! I've had most of the featured entree and its all good recently the black peppered chicken is awesome!!  The wife is in love with the Carmel steak or chicken.  Big entrees so good enough to share but we had a buy 1 get 1 free so we ate like royalty!   

Always clean and good service. If you are looking for a good place in the Arrowhead area to eat look at Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"My 12 year old daughter and I just returned from this location and we both got very sick.  She had the orange chicken and me the Pad Thai w chicken.  Gross"}
{"text":"Always fresh and great price for what you get! I like that it caters to glutenfree as well."}
{"text":"The food was incredible. The wait was about 20 minutes at 6pm on a Friday night. They have this cool fountain drink machine that has all kinds of flavors of your favorite pop. Even raspberry diet coke!!! The manager was very helpful at finding us a place to sit as soon as it became available. For how busy they were, they didn't seem frazzled or rushed and everything seemed under control. Well managed place."}
{"text":"The closing time was 9pm on Sunday and we were inside the restaurant a few mins before 9. The sign said Open, yet they refused to take our order."}
{"text":"I love the Mongolian beef with noodles & have getting here for years. I was glad to see no Arpaio in sight & the doors back open. My wife loves the Dan Dan noodles & the kids get honey seared chicken. I stop in this crazy busy location only when I'm in the area because the parking lot is insane. I think the concept is great & the service is always quick. Consistency is the key to this place."}
{"text":"What can you say about great, reliable, consistent Asian food every time.  I just found out that they have a gluten free menu for my kids, YIPPEE!  I could tell you what I order but it would be easier to call it in and after I give them my phone number they tell me what I ordered last time so I can just duplicate it....are we all creatures of habit?  It's great!  I love this place, the atmosphere is awesome in the high end shopping center on the SW corner of 67ave & 101 near AJ's.  The service is always fast and the Mongolian beef on noodles is heaven.  The wife likes the Dan Dan bowl and my daughter always gets the honey seared chicken and of course we always get the crab won-tons.  If you have room you can hit up the cold stone creamery next door....but that's a whole other YELP!"}
{"text":"Gentleman named Hector greeted us and helped us with the menu very kind and helpful food portions big appetizers brought out right away good thing we sure were hungry a lot of drink selections was a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Finally Tried Pei Wei. Next level Panda with California rolls.. IMO. DH agreed. Food was good, but pricey, we thought . Would pick a local Chinese restaurant instead, for the price."}
{"text":"Latino dude got mad when I told him I didn't want any rice , like it was his food! He put so much rice in my child's order. Karma is something though!!!! Never again will I eat at this chain! Not like the ones in Michigan. They are always rude but these two guys in the kitchen laughing and joking. One black the other Latino or Mexican on 5-20! Were total ass holes for my 16 year old special request! Karma is a bitch"}
{"text":"I give Pei Wei thumbs up because the dishes are good  for a chain. Because of my social circle, I've eaten here a lot in the past year. I feel that the dishes here are healthy and well presented. Pretty much everything can be made with  just tofu and vegetables. However be sure to ask since some dishes are not complete vegetarian, they are cooked in oysters sauce. I love the fact that they have Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Thai food here, but where is Filipino? It would be great if they add Vegetarian Adobo or Pancit Noodles. Those can be made vegetarian or even vegan.
I think the staff here is very nice, the food is reasonably priced  and the establishment is clean.   
You know another good thing about this particular location? You can pick up the free wi-fi from Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"Back of haters, but I love Pei Wei.   Since I don't eat sentient beings, and only consume plant food. Pei Wei was very accommodating. I ordered the Lettuce Wraps with Tofu instead of Chicken. What can I say? They were delish and nutrish, and no I am not ashamed to admit that I eat here. The people that dog this place are so clueless, I'm sorry. What do you expect? This is Americanized Asian food. If you want authentic Asian food, then don't eat here and  check yelp first. Don't dog businesses because you're expecting authentic. Seriously!  LOL....  Another plus is they have free wi-fi. I love it.  :)"}
{"text":"I like Pei-Wei and this place is a great location. It's also close to my house. I thought their service was great. I've always  enjoyed their Tofu dishes."}
{"text":"Super disappointing. They took our favorite things off the menu. When I called and they said they didn't have it, I said it was on the menu online so how do I know what you guys no longer carry anymore and the guy wasn't sure and gave a horrible uniformed response. My lady ordered the food there for us and she was told 10-15 minutes. While waiting after she already paid, they then tell her that they ran out of the pork egg rolls. They offered something else. In the end, she waited almost 30 minutes for the food and when we went to eat it, it was super disappointing because the portions looks smaller and all for the same price. For sure done with Pei Wei. Sucks to see a good place go downhill."}
{"text":"Its nothing fancy but I seem to go there every time I am in town. The food i really good and is priced right."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is spot on and delicious and other times it is quite salty at this location.  Very difficult to get a consistently good meal.  Menu items add up quickly."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to pick up some healthy Asian cuisine. I always take-out my order, and ordering online is my suggested method, and you can even pay at the restaurant as opposed to online, though that is an option. It is my go-to when I have a late flight and I literally order as I head to long term parking. The Korean spicy is awesome, as well as the lettuce wraps. As for ordering convenice, location, price, and quality of cuisine, you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Not great food at all. All tables were left dirty.  We had never been before and were quite disappointed after passing other favorite options to give PeiWei a try. The pad thai noodles were like rubber bands, the hand roll sushi was falling apart. Will not return. Will not suggest to others."}
{"text":"You know, this was one of my favorite Pei Wei experiences... they got the food out fast even though it was lunch time and they were pretty busy. The service was also great on top of that. The lady we ordered from even gave us the \"To Go\" cups rather than the hard plastic ones, which I always have to request at other locations. She did it before I even had a chance to ask! She said that she was psychic ;)

Their iced tea was delicious, as usual. The food was also great, but no better or worse than other locations. I really don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but this particular location stood out a bit from the rest."}
{"text":"Got an email for 2 entrees for 10 dollars.  The entrees usually run for about 10 dollars each so it was like a BOGO deal.

The wifey and I usually get the Mongolian Beef with brown rice.  My son also tried it and my daughter gets an order of lettuce wraps.

They seemed very busy tonight so everyone must have gotten the same email.  We waited a good 20 minutes for our food.  It usually doesn't take that long so this was weird.

The food was good as always but they did shaft us with the lettuce wraps.  They gave us the center of the lettuce head so we go about 4 good lettuce leaves.  Oh well.

I also order he Pad Thai when I don't feel like eating rice.  A little more expensive than what I like to pay but he food is good and we had a deal."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say love the additional menu items - such as Ahi Avocado Salad and the new Orange Chicken.  Went on Wednesday (June 13, 2018) after a self imposed break do to quality.  Have to say the restaurant seems to be on the up spring.  order the Ahi Salad, Kung Pao Shrimp and the new Orange Chicken (only $5 right now).  All of the food was amazing.  Reminds of how Pei Wei use to be when it first opened.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Food server even came over asking if everything was OK and even offered to refill our drinks.  Still miss the old napkins - but one day at a time."}
{"text":"Sitting here waiting for my food. Was waited on quickly and politely. Cute little Hispanic girl was helping me. After getting my receipt I was just watching and observed something I never thought I would see in my life time..wow. So there is a petite white girl working the register. Looks to me like her first job so I am guessing 15/16ish. Can't be much more. Anyways an older couple come up and ordered the young lady tells them the total and I believe the gentleman handed her a $20.00 and then went for his change. After pulling out what looked like $3.00 or more of change the young lady simple looked at him and said sorry I already put this in! He strode there wide eyed and looked his wife then at me and I said OMG, don't they teach kids math anymore? It's a sad day when a young person cannot or will not do basic math.. I gotta say my food is food and so was MY service but had that young girl did that to me she would have gotten a lesson on math and customer service which she displayed so poorly..should someone with obviously no grasp on basic math be running a register? Anyways, long and short of it is it-be happy with your pocket full of change. I am the employee and I don't have time to take of you as you deserve.

Called n order and then drove to location, checked n and watched no less than 3 people walk in order and get there food before me. So sad, been a long time since I was here because of last encounter. Very disappointed with your service or lack there of. Last visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Best place for quick delicious take out or dine in. Staff is very friendly. Food is made fast. Prices are great. Very consistently made flavorful dishes.
Really good crab wontons, Dan Dan noodles, and Pad Thai. The restaurant is satisfactory clean for the volume of clients.
I have to give major points to the night manager who was working the other night when I was getting my to go order. He dealt professionally with a very difficult customer, who I think just generally speaking hated life and was trying to make every one else miserable. The restaurant was packed he looked very busy, but took time to address her issues. Then he came back and politely attended the registers, bagged to go orders among other things. 
Well done you!"}
{"text":"Love the food but tried to dine in and order at the restaurant. It was an hour wait because of all the online orders and there were more people waiting to pick up then actually eating at the restaurant. Poor management decisions to allow only online orders to be made."}
{"text":"Pei Wei food ranges from decent to mediocre. I say this because there isn't a single dish that stands out or makes you want to come back for more. Everything on the menu is something you've already seen and eaten more than a dozen times. There is nothing wrong with serving dishes that are popular or easy to cook. But one would at least expect these run-of-a-mill dishes to be made properly. I've eaten at Pei Wei multiple times and most of the times the food was just OK. But there were also times when the vegetables (especially the Broccoli and Carrots) were very dry and sauce (Kung Pao or anything other sauce for that matter) not mixed evenly with the entree -  there is just no consistency. The only good thing that can be said about Pei Wei is their service that is extremely fast. 

Choose Pei Wei if you need to take your colleagues for lunch during work hours or if you are desperate for some average Chinese food."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten in here in a while and I was pleasantly surprised. I am on a health kick right now, so I was glad to see their many healthy options now. I ordered the Thai Dynamite chicken....but grilled chicken and on top a salad rather then rice. It wasn't as yummy as how it is normally prepared, but I felt much better and healthier about what I ordered after I ate it. Good to know if I am craving from Chinese food, I can come here and order some healthier options!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We received an offer for a free entree which brought us in. We started with Pork egg rolls, which were pretty greasy and lacked flavor. I ordered the general tso chicken and my husband ordered chow mein. I thought his noodles were completely void of flavor and my chicken was a bit too spicy and just not overly appealing. He ended up taking my food as leftovers but I am in no rush to come back anytime soon. They have one of the fancy soda machines but it was out of more than it had in stock. Not worth it for the price, especially with so many better Chinese food restaurants within a few miles. Pass"}
{"text":"I like coming to Pei Wei for their Honey Seared entrees. The quality of their chicken is good. The tofu is delicious but it can seem too greasy at times. My only issue is that they give an immense portion of rice. It's not MUST HAVE Asian food, but it something that is definitely satisfying when you're craving Asian flavors. A great alternative to Panda Express. Their sushi is so-so."}
{"text":"Good for a quick meal. Food is sometimes very well prepared and other times bland and cold. Just depends what's going on when you visit."}
{"text":"I recently stopped by this location for dinner with my parents after grabbing some things across the way from Costco. This was actually my first Pei Wei experience. Once you walk in, you order your meal at the register and they deliver it to your table. The inside was very nice, modern style, but in a quick serve feel. I also thought the menu choices were nice, tons of options and lots of pescatarian friendly dishes.

Once the food came out it looked beautiful, but the taste was just kind of meh to me. The crab wontons were in a bed of sauce which made them get a bit soggy. The overall flavor was alright, but the sauce pool just turned me off. I also ordered the Ahi Avocado Salad. The flavor was decent and plenty of fish, but the ingredients were not all that fresh. Part of my avocado in the salad was brown. I'm actually somewhat surprised they still severed it that way. 

I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back here, but maybe if I'm feeling like a salad and there's nothing around I might go back."}
{"text":"The one star goes to the 45 min hold time . I'm not sure why I wasn't able to place my order! Very disappointed had to eat chipotle instead! Get it together"}
{"text":"This location has more often than not disappointed.   Tonight I ordered a take out order, it was Read back to me correctly, and when I picked it up it was correct in the receipt.  I'm not sure what dish was prepared for me, but it was a far stretch from the order.   The order modifications were not even considers, and my extra sauce on the side was clearly just water that rinsed the cooking pan and put into a container.   

I can be sympathetic to mistakes happening but this was clearly a lack of effort or care from the kitchen.   When I called to ask for the order to be remade I sat on hold for 15 minutes from 9:15 pm to 9:30...when they close.   

Obviously the staff didn't want to receive another order or likely another complaint as they were ending the night.  
If your in the mood for Asian food in central Phoenix go to Panda Express or China Chili.   Save yourself the frustration, I should have learned my lesson with my pervious poor experiences."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. We had Mongolian beef with fried rice and sweet and sour chicken with brown rice. Also added 2 crab wontons which were actually very good and side of noodles. Next time I wanna try the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Excellent food this place is always busy. Good for takeout also. Very different food and I think you will enjoy it. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I walked in thinking it looks like a better version of the fast food Chinese places and it sure is...Way better.The place is clean and has a separate counter for pick up orders.You can order online and customization is simple.They offer reward points for every purchase.

The food is good and filling.You can order a small or a large bowl depending on your appetite.Its a great place for a quick Lunch or to go if you are in the mood for some Chinese fast food.I love their Entrees especially the sweet and sour,mongolian and thai dynamite.The entrees are served with white/brown Rice or Noodles.You can pick your proteins and customize what vegetable goes into your bowl.They also have a ton of sushi and salads to choose from.

And Yes, they have outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"We came in 2 minutes before closing and they helped us with a smile!  They didn't even try and kick us out after 40 minutes. Good was great, fast and fresh. Would come here again because they where so nice to still serve us."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is similar to Panda Express but WAY BETTER! Every order is made fresh and is also customizable. They are fast, affordable, and delicious. The portions, price, and flavor totally beat places like Panda Express. This place also has lots of options for vegetarians. 

My favorites are the Sesame chicken(extra spicy) with brown rice and the Bangkok Noodles with tofu! Definitely a great place for a quick lunch or a late night dinner."}
{"text":"I come to Pei Wei regularly, and Erick and Erin were on their game with customer service tonight. Thanks for putting the customers first"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Pei Wei if you're looking for fresh quality ingredients at a very fair price.  I've tried just about everything on the menu and it's all really good except for the green curry which I found very bland to my taste.  Other than that everything else has been really good and the prices are more than reasonable.  Two entree's will run you about $17 with tax (no drink)."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is Pei Wei. You love it or you don't. I think their food is pretty decent and they appeal to the masses, even people who are not fans of Asian food seem happy here. Its just good reasonably priced takeout. The Ahwatukee location is actually closer to home but this one is more on my way home so I am happy I finally tried to give it a try. They were super quick with my order, got everything right and very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  They were able to take an existing building and preserve it, featuring the original brickwork and beams.  The building is shared with a Starbucks.  Pei Wei is no great shakes but there are not a lot of options in an area where everything opens for lunch and then closes at 3.  The potstickers are quite good, I like the Pei Wei Spicy Beef.  My wife tends to order the lettuce wraps, but has been disappointed with the quality of the lettuce at least once.  All of our visits here have been for carryout.  They handle phone orders very efficiently.  Parking is problematic here.  There are a couple of spots reserved for carryout but they are not respected.  There have been a couple of times when it looked like I might have to park across 7th Ave in the antique store, but I have been lucky so far."}
{"text":"This place is a step up from fast food Chinese food. It is pretty good for a quick bite to eat. The only entree I ever order is the Mongolian Beef. You can also see the kitchen from the dining area, I like that. The place appears to be clean."}
{"text":"I go to this location quite a bit, I'm kinda sad they eliminated the Orange PEEL Chicken! It's been replaced with just Orange chicken and that's all it is! No veggies or beans or water chestnuts :( Also, they just changed their rewards program and all my past purchases no longer apply!
     The positives: employees are great, if I ask for extra ginger or wasabi, they give a lot and willingly:) the Pad Thai (I get it with tofu) is seriously the best I've ever had, and I've tried a lot. I love the generous amount of tofu and bean sprouts and the sauce is just delicious. I have leftovers the next day from this dish"}
{"text":"Tried to call in my order. Was on hold. Decided to drive over. Ordered in person while I was still on hold. Asked for a manager and showed the manager my phone, still on hold over 18 minutes. She just gave me a not believable \"Sorry, haven't gotten to the phones\". I was the only one in line."}
{"text":"What is happening at Pei Wei?  This location has always consistent.  Friday night.  Place is filthy.  Had to wipe down my table to sit.  I thought it was strange when they gave us free drinks at the counter come to find out there is not a chip of ice in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"They do not have the Spicy Korean at this location. I came in wanting to try something new. I issued get Pad Thai or Lo Mein, which I've always loved, but unfortunately they apparently don't and haven't (I was informed) has the Spicy Korean on the menu for a long time. 

The cash register, though I had to ask her and she didn't immediately recommend something comparable to the menu item they didn't not have, recommended the Kung Pao or the Pei Wei Spicy. I got the Kung Pao and an order of Crab Wontons. We'll see how this goes."}
{"text":"Terrible!

This review is mainly on my \"take out\" experience. I had tried numerous times to order online and their system wasn't working thru laptop or cellphone. I then called in at 6:44pm to place my order instead. I was told via phone my order should be ready by 7:20pm. I arrived at 7:20 pm and did not receive my order until 7:50pm. This is unacceptable. 

There were little to no room to stand to wait for food. This caused a lot of confusion and other patrons were also frustrated. 

I had to double check to ensure my order was all there. In which to no surprise, it wasn't. They were missing 2 items. The lettuce to my lettuce wraps and soup. Come on folks!! I know people make mistakes but PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO DOUBLE CHECK YOUR WORK!! 

This location should really re-evaluate their efficiencies and quality of service, especially, during peak hours. I'm extremely disappointed with this experience. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pei Wei has a special,  Orange Chicken on either brown or white rice. It's scrumptious!  And it's only & 5.00!  All 7 cooks are busy tonight... tables aren't full, so I'm guessing a lot of people are taking their food to-go.   The music is upbeat & not too loud.  Glad Pei Wei was tonight's destination.  :-)"}
{"text":"Great location and pretty close to my house. I am used to going to one in Arizona that will always get a four or five star rating from me, but using that logic doesn't usually pan out.

So, I ordered the pad Thai with chicken. Noodles were undercooked, chicken was fine. I took out all the chicken myself and asked for another plate of noodles because they were under. Cashier/person at the register was apologetic. 10 minutes later, came the second batch. . .

 Exactly the same. 

At this point I just gave up and left. 
There were so many employees running around;  obviously no method to their madness. 
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is usually my take out place of choice. It's quick, inexpensive, close, and delicious. I usually get the shrimp lo mein. Now I'll be honest, there are so many white and green onions that I smell like an onion for hours! But I still get it, it's so tasty! :-)

It's a little too crowded and noisey for me to want to stay and eat if it's after 3pm. The fact that it is crowded is a good thing and says people like to eat their food, however, it's cramped and things are always being dropped and people are always pushing past your table."}
{"text":"I just finished my meal at this pei wei. The food was delicious however we had to wait for over 25 minutes for our food to be served and the chef was yelling at his employees and calling them sissies and demeaning language and many people turned their heads to look. Not a professional look."}
{"text":"The food has gone downhill. The Pad Thai bowl was an oversalted soup of noodles and unpleasant unidentifiable solids: tofu? The bowl has 215% of recommended sodium. The tea was supposedly flavored with cinnamon. It had an unpleasant chemical taste. I finished neither. Never again."}
{"text":"This review is for take out only.

Whenever we have large family gatherings and we're in a pinch for some quick take-out, Pei Wei is our go-to restaurant.  The food is consistently good, the portions are big, and there's something  on the menu to please everybody, even my picky nephews.  I also really like their hearty brown rice, it's yummy and it makes for a nice alternative to the same ol' boring white rice most places offer.

The take out service is better than most too.  The staff is super friendly and they always make sure we have plenty of extra sauces and fortune cookies.  Maybe it's because my family are regulars, but the staff at Pei Wei couldn't be nicer.  This last weekend we ordered food for 12+ people and they got everything right. 

Lastly, there's the value.  Considering how much food we carted away for take-out, we were surprised at how reasonable our tab was. Although we've never sat down for a meal in the restaurant, I highly recommend Pei Wei for take-out."}
{"text":"I've probably ordered online, at this location, at least 10x- I've never had an issue. Yesterday I ordered online and when I arrived to this Pei Wei, 20 minutes later, I was advised that they were not able to accept any card transactions, as their system was down, and asked if I could pay in cash. I told them I never carry cash on me. I was very disappointed in the customer service. My order was already made and it was their problem, not mine. They had my contact info and could've reached out, and I would've been more than willing to stop by for cash on my way to pick it. Rather, they notify me when I got there and allowed me to walk out empty handed. Disappointed and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went to pei wei for one reason, for their lettuce chicken wraps and got all the way home and they didn't pack the lettuce. Customer service was ok. They didn't really make any suggestions. I usually enjoy pei Wei but this experience has me doubting their abilities to do simple orders."}
{"text":"Short and sweet! It is good, fresh and dependable. My favorite is the mongolian beef! Love it! We usually sit out if possible bc the cooking area is open to the seating area so its a bit loud. But Im a definite fan! Love it!"}
{"text":"What an awful experience. Food was good but not worth the experience. Spent 30 minutes calling in an order - never got someone on the phone. Tried to online order through the website - that wouldn't work either. Then I downloaded their app and that wouldn't work either! My husband finally just arrived there in person to get our food and gets home and they didn't include all the food we paid for either. So now we need to get refunded and can't since they don't answer their phone? What a stressful experience-won't be putting ourselves through this mess again."}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time. The food was always fresh and cooked well. As of the last year, all quality of food as gone down the tubes. Way too over priced for this food. I may as well go to Panda Express. I also found a peanut in my food last night...if my wife would have got this in her food we would be in the hospital, or I would be possibly picking out a casket."}
{"text":"The hubby said he wanted PeiWei for his father's day lunch. So PeiWei it was. I order the pad thai and j orders the mongolian steak. J loved his dish.  My pad thai was seriously underseasoned. So I reordered the honey sear chicken, which was awesome!! 

On non food note - this place is bathroom baby friendly with a changing station. And as a new mom, that's a necessity in my book."}
{"text":"I am usually a big pei wei fan but I was just served raw chicken from this place. I would at least recommend going to another pei wei, steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"ok, this place TOTALLY gets it!  Awesome food, reasonable prices (especially when you see how fresh and tasty it all is) and spectacular service.  

I'm a tough consumer and I am a straight shooter; if it's good, I'll say it's good, if it's bad, I'm gonna say that too... so when I tell you that Pei Wei is worth battling the Ballentyne traffic and the 485 construction - you can believe it really is that good  :-)  

I order online and pick it up- their online system is user friendly and easy to navigate, it's also easy to be very picky with your order, which I appreciate.  Their rangoons have more crab in them than anywhere else I've ever ordered them from.  Their wonton soup is also the best wonton soup I've ever had.  It's not the luke warm, super salty chicken broth with green onions floating on the top with slimy hunks of wet dough...  no- it's a light, very tasty broth, small, delicate wontons full of filling, actual fresh bok choy leaves floating on the top along with the green onions - LOVE IT!   (just remember- you have to request the fried noodles to float in your soup, they don't automatically offer them like other chinese places do).  Today I also tried their edamame, another hit  :-)  

Pei Wei is operated by the P.F. Changs folks, which makes sense.  It's a great place to go for quick, fresh, very tasty chinese food  :-)"}
{"text":"The only thing that keeps the review 3 stars is the food. I don't like to be this type of person but your staff is freaking rude. All day every day. Mostly in person rather than on the phone. But try the teriyaki sushi. It's pretty delicious."}
{"text":"We used to eat here quite often (2-3x per month), and have tried just about everything on the menu.  Lately the dishes have just not been as tasty.  Also, tonight when we went there, the portion sizes actually got smaller.  When 2 people are eating for $18.xx, I expect to have enough food to fill me up.  

We are both active people, so we eat a fair amount, but we usually have leftovers unless we share a dish.  On this occasion, I left hungry after we shared 2 dishes.  We asked the server about the portion size and he assured us \"everything is weighed\".  The part omitted, presumably, was \"now we measure out less\".  Another diner also complained about portion size while we were there.  This place is emptier every time we visit.  Doubt we'll go back again.  Sorry Pei Wei, seems like you have run your course."}
{"text":"We order ahead for a set time and every time the food is not ready.   We end up waiting at least 10 minutes after scheduled pick up time.    Food portions have shrunk over time but cost the same.  Food quality is still good and service is always friendly.  If it was not for the tastiness of the food - I would stop coming."}
{"text":"Love my quick & easy oriental food! The menu is great and you can't go wrong! We love the honey seared chicken, orange chicken and Mongolian beef! The lettuce wraps, edamame and chicken rolls are so yummy too!!! I especially love that they have coupons and run specials."}
{"text":"Pei wei is always good.  I like everything so far!  Their salad are really great.  The service is excellent.  And the location is so convenient."}
{"text":"Skip PF Changs. Eat here


Originally, PF changs created Pei Wei to compete in the fast food industry, however I think they did too well as Pei Wei is better in many ways than PF changs.

It taste as good, its cheaper and faster.   They have many options mostly meat/w some kind of rice or side. 

They give you free oranges slices with your drink, as many as you want!!!!

It pretty clean and never crowded.  Its a solid place for lunch or to-go"}
{"text":"I've been to other locations several times but this was my first and last visit to this location. I always order the Thai Coconut Curry with chicken and rice noodles. I placed my order just like that. The person ringing me up seemed very distracted as she asked me three times if I wanted brown or white rice. I said rice noodles a total of FOUR times. I got my order and brought it back to work for lunch. When I opened it up, the first thing that I noticed was that it was made with regular noodles, not rice noodles. The worst part, though, was that EVERY SINGLE PIECE of chicken was chewy and fatty. Disgusting!! Never going to this location again."}
{"text":"While I was visiting AZ a while back, a co-worker treated me to lunch here.  I loved it!  I wish they would bring this franchise to Chicago.

Basically, you order at the register, they give you a number, then they bring it to your table.  Same concept as Corner Bakery.  I had the Mongolian Beef on Fried Rice.  So good!  I remember there was a station next to the soda fountain that had all of the different sauces.

I really enjoyed it and thought it was a nice change from the choices in Chicago."}
{"text":"I enjoy noodle houses and this was a good one. Had the Shrimp Pad Thai and it was great, my partner had the won ton soup and she enjoyed that as well. I have seen some tough reviews of this place lately but honestly I though it was great. It Asian fast food! Not fine dining. They do have beer and wine. The wait for our dishes was about 3 minutes. The kitchen was very busy preparing take out orders. Looked very busy. We enjoyed our meal and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Ordered and paid through the Android app last night.
When I arrived at the location a sign was hanging off all the doors reading, CLOSED DUE TO LOW STAFF.
This location has gone to crap anymore. The front of house is abysmal - the back of house is marginally ok and is the only thing keeping this place on life support, in my opinion.
For awhile, I've been hoping managment can turn this location around, but at this point I'm just hoping to get my money back..."}
{"text":"clean simple and delicious.  If you're tired of panda id definitely recommend PEI WEEEIIII  this place just makes me want to run inside and scream PEI WEEIII

huge portions of everything so its satisfying for sure"}
{"text":"I love this place, always enjoy the food here, this time we came,  girl name Jessica was taking the order, she was very friendly and brought us some extra checkin to keep my boys happy 
Thanks for great  service"}
{"text":"We went to this Pei Wei for a work lunch yesterday.  While I haven't been to a Pei Wei in a while, I have always enjoyed their food.  In particular, the Orange Peel shrimp (and chicken.)  I like that dish at P.F. Chang's as well, but preferred it at Pei Wei because they added thinly sliced carrots as well as snap peas to the dish.  The protein, shrimp or chicken were lightly dusted with a breading and the entire dish was flavorful with a nice light sauce.  
However, their new dish, Wei Veggie Orange Chicken (subbed shrimp), has heavily breaded shrimp, is about half the size of the dish they used to serve and is sickeningly sweet. 
I won't go back."}
{"text":"I decided to give this location another try today.  I had a completely different experience from the first time I ordered from there.  Once again I ordered online and picked up my order to go.  The woman who waited on me this time was very nice and when I arrived my order wasn't ready yet so she asked me if I would like a water or drink.  I said yes to the drink and handed her my card to pay for it.  She said oh no, it's on me.  I thought that was a very nice touch since I needed to wait for my food to be finished.  I'm so happy with this experience considering how bad of a first impression I had with this place.  I ordered the veggie fried rice in the small size and the portion was still really big.  The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is fitting for the diner longing for a meal between fast food and casual dining. Their $6.25 low fare menu plus a drink will bring the cost of a meal to around $9.75 before a tip. That is what I expect to pay. 

   Pei Wei does not serve ordinary Chinese food. They serve food from China, Japan, Thailand, Korea, and Vietnam. In my case I was unfamiliar with the menu items, excluding rice and won ton soup. Ordering was trial and error.

   Their Low Fare dinner selects menu, starting at $6.25 makes me a fan. It includes an entree, side, and white or steamed rice. The entree choices are Kung Pao, Pei Wei Spicy (chicken or vegetable and tufu is $6.25, steak is $6.75, and shrimp is $7.25), Teriyaki Honey Seared, and Mongolian. The side choices are a spring roll, cup of soup, or Asian slaw.

  I was satisfied with the chicken Pei Wei. It was quality that I expect from their parent company P.F. Chengs. And the won ton soup is delicious. 

  If this is your first time at Pei Wei Asian Diner, you will order off a menu up front at the time that you pay. They will give you a number and glass if you are drinking a beverage (they also have tea). A server will bring your food to your table. Sit back and enjoy your food."}
{"text":"disappointing visit to be sure. first, for several minutes the order register was unattended. customers stood looking for help and other staff ignored them.

Second, they got my order wrong.  I ordered won ton soup and a chicken teryaki bowl. I was served sweet and sour soup. When the cook was told he'd made the wrong item he was in no hurry to make the correct item. 

portions have shrunk, and the quality is not there. The teriyaki bowl was some clumpy rice with a few strips of onion and a trace of spinach. 

Third, the restaurant was dirty. there was dried rice on my seat. Several tables needed wiping. The soy sauce bottles were greasy and sticky.

But mostly the staff seemed unhappy, reluctant to engage with customers, watching the clock tick. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick, healthy lunch.  I love going all veggie with the sauce on the side for a low cal alternative.  I love that it is quick and easy in and out."}
{"text":"This is our local Pei Wei, and I love Asian food.  This is the only real place my wife likes.  So we eat here alot.  This location is sometimes slow but I alwasy enjoy the food.  We order online, and orders always come out exactly the way you want with all the substitues."}
{"text":"I went to this Pei Wei a while back. it was crowed and the foods taste good. I stop going there after I saw the bad reviews on TV channel 5 in 2005. There were 8 violations regarding to their kitchen. 

I still like the Pei Wei at other locations though."}
{"text":"Typically consistent food. Even though my last order was messed up.  I ordered Pei Wei spicy and fried rice, but got brown rice and they put the rice in a separate container.  What gives?"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner. Lettuce Wraps are amazing.. Crab Ragoons could use some more cream cheese.. overall not a bad meal."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to pei wei. I used to love it, but it's been going down hill for awhile. Last time was awful. They ran out of shrimp. Not sure how that happens. ...go across the street to smith's and buy more! The wonton soup was like drinking a brine....waaaay too salty! I should have sent it back, but just wanted to go."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot and reasonably priced for a chain restaurant.  The service here is good, it does get busy sometimes so there might be a little of a wait to order.  But once the food is ordered it doesn't take too long for it to show.  

Had the Dan Dan noodles with chicken today, good solid noodle dish.  My other favorite here is the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps!"}
{"text":"This location is on my list!   Let me give you a rundown of what happened last week.  Keeping in mind I have been to this location many times and have had a great experience. 

We were hungry, didn't know what to get so we did the old standby and went to Pei Wei.  We went in, place our order: 
-Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad
-Thai Dynamite Chicken with brown rice
-Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls.
We were handed a buzzer (#8) because we were taking it to-go and were told the order will be about 10 min....
15 min passed and I thought wow this is taking awhile, but I didn't want to be pushy so we waited, and waited, and waited and at 20 min, I looked at a table of people that placed their order after us. They were enjoying their meal... WHAT THE....?!?!?!
So I walked over and said, \"excuse me we haven't been buzzed and the people that placed their order after us seem to be enjoying their meal.\"  She looked over at a bag just sitting on the counter (for God knows how long) and laughed and said in a \"giggly voice\" can I get you chop sticks or forks.  I thought to myself, it's not EVEN worth getting mad, just leave... So I said both please, and left.   
Meanwhile we get to our destination, open our bag to: 
- Coconut Curry Chicken
- a container with a plain salad
- a container of chicken that goes in a lettuce wrap
- Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls(that looked like they were rolled by a waffle cone maker. 
-and a sack of condiments. 

WHAT THE.....?!?!?!?!

So I am LIVID at this point, but my partner makes the call, because I would probably reach through the phone at this point.... Everything was resolved over the phone.  Unfortunately, for us our dinner experience did not meet our expectations on any level... 

I have been here when this manager  was working before.  I remember him being extremely helpful, very nice, and really knows his customer service.   Unfortunately, I think it was a result of one person that completely ruined my experience.  It will be some time before I go to this Pei Wei again."}
{"text":"Love pei wei, but this location has a problem with the phone lines, they need to fix them. No one answers the phone"}
{"text":"I've been to Pei Wei Restaurants all over the country. Sunday I ordered by phone and picked up 3 meals plus appetizers to eat at home.
We each took a few bites, realized that the chicken was still basically raw, and threw it out.
What a waste of 50.00.
I'm so disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the friendliest PeiWei location. They always are so cheerful and helpful. They have such ample and healthy kids meal options, there's something for everyone's taste. We always enjoy PeiWei, but this is the friendliest location in our opinion."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei but unfortunately this location did not stand up to Pei Wei's standards.
The fried rice was mushy and my plate was floating in sauce from my main entree.
Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if I could. Service has gone down so bad at this location. It's like they are chickens with their heads cut off. We came after lunch and it wasn't busy at all. Food took about 20 mins and it was cold. This isn't the first time. It's sad because this used to be a good location. Guess I will have to drive to a different one. The people all seem lost when they are looking at dishes. Sometimes it takes more than 3 people to figure out where 2 dishes go. It's pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"After reading reviews from others, I feel like we went somewhere else. I mean sure, the place was clean, but that's about where the similarities end. You walk in, order your items, take a seat and get your food - not much can go wrong there, right? Well... 

For a \"quick serve\" style restaurant, it shouldn't be that difficult, especially when there aren't too many people there. I mean we're talking noodles and rice, perhaps with a few proteins and a veggies thrown in. And when I mean a few, I mean a few. Look up the definition of \"few\", and you'll get \"small number of\". That dish you just ordered probably has perhaps 3-4 small shrimp or pieces of chicken, a couple pieces of broccoli, a rather outsized number of peppers and the rest is rice or noodles.

Almost the entire rest is noodles or rices - that isn't unusual.

There isn't anything wrong with that, exactly, and the flavor isn't bad, it's just that the presentation is so... off. I mean take a little time and chop up the protein, rather than throwing the carbs in the bowl with the veg and two proteins and it might be better (you know, more like an actual chinese restaurant, with little chunks and better presentation?). It just makes you feel better about it."}
{"text":"I always get the Kung Pao Chicken. I've tried a few other entrees that my husband had (like a Thai dish that was pretty good) but my favorite is definitely the Kung Pao. Fresh, crispy snow peas and carrots and not drenched in sauce. And the crab ragoons are to die for!"}
{"text":"Service was decent but I ordered orange chicken not white rice as my entree. Literally more than 3/4 of my food was white rice. Really disappointed"}
{"text":"Online order service never works!

 Is this 2017?

Update your software Pei Wei! Invest in your infrastructure!  



Extremely frustrating."}
{"text":"There's nothing more frustrating than ordering food \"to go\"only to get home and your order is incorrect or incomplete. I have dined at Sunset Pei Wei many times alone and wanted to share with my family so I opted for To go order. Sadly my order was incorrect and worse my lettuce wrap was missing LETTUCE. I asked for light sauce on Mongolian Beef and on Stir Fry, but almost as if out of spite my entrees were drowned in sauces. The sauces were overwhelmingly sweet and my cabbage was missing as requested instead of rice. This place claims to be a healthy option for fast dining, but I'm thinking it's all smoke as per usual. Not returning!"}
{"text":"I hate to give 1 Star Reviews but Pei Wei's Henderson location has earned it. It is not that hard to cook chicken and to put together dishes that are not soggy or undercooked, but this location did just that. In fact the food that I literally just ordered on 05/17/2016 at 7:35 pm to bring home and is still warm is now sitting in the trash. When my wife and my son both spit it back out I knew it was bad. But when I tried my Dynamite chicken that's supposed to have Sriracha sauce only to find it was a soggy mess and lacked any flavor to speak of and the chicken was undercooked, I spit it out.  In the years I've been doing reviews on Yelp, it is ultra rare that all 3 of us ended up spitting our food back out and tossing it in the trash. 

1 Star. Only because Yelp says I have to give one, and trust me it's given under protest. Let me be clear, when even my 6 year old says don't order that again, believe me I won't be. This location is not up to the same standards as other Pei Wei locations, and considering how undercooked the meat actually was, I'm seriously thinking of asking the SNHD to pay them a visit.

Edit: Complaint filed with Pei Wei corporate. They need to fix this before someone gets sick from eating undercooked food. Meat thermometers are cheap. They need to buy some and use them. There's no excuse for what they sent out the door tonight. None at all."}
{"text":"This place is awful! I had a catering order and my Mongolian beef had raw onions just thrown in the top not even cooked and sauteed with the sauce. Horrible customer service as well. Will never use this location again."}
{"text":"I don't get why this place is so popular, I've never had a \"good\" meal here. I tend to like the spicier dishes like Thai, but their \"Thai\" inspired dishes are bland Chinese dishes trying to be Thai food. I keep seeing delicious LOOKING dishes pop up on their adverts from time to time, but then I try them and can barely finish the meal. The atmosphere is always clean and professional, but they are just a mediocre brand relying on hype to stay in business."}
{"text":"Love their Lo mein noodles. Large portions and I like how you can customize what you want. Lo mein has a good smoky flavor. Wonton soup is good too."}
{"text":"This is like a fast food asian type of spot. Its pretty good for what it is. Stopped by here one day because it was close to a golf course that i wanted to play at. Think i had the lemon pepper chicken, it was good."}
{"text":"Today, they lost our order, and I was extremely impressed how the staff and managers handled it.  Since my children had to wait almost 30 minutes for dinner, they comped our meal.  People and companies often make mistakes, but how you handle your mistakes is what counts.  They handled the situation correctly and apologized immediately."}
{"text":"Ordered a 8pc Mango Roll and I guess they forgot to actually prepare it. We ordered it at 11:35am and just received it at 11:55. When I went to check on the order they asked what I was waiting on and I said my order. The cashier talked to the kitchen and about 5 mins later they brought us our rolls. No apology or anything. SMH."}
{"text":"This Pei Wei location has such kind, welcoming staff. They are so accommodating and hospitable. 5 stars, hands down."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and never again! Each time the entree was made differently: one time there was hardly any sauce in the orange chicken, another time the crab rangoons were just awful, and to top it off, each time they made a mistake in my billing. The food is just awful here."}
{"text":"After driving around for awhile to find a place to eat without a wait, I ended up at pei Wei with James C.  I discovered that they revamped the menu entirely. Now you pick a protein and a sauce. No more combos :(

I decided to have chicken with spicy Korean sauce and brown rice. We also shared an order of lettuce wraps. Lettuce wraps were as expected. My dish came out and it didn't look like what I expected, but I was hopeful and waited until James got his to dig in. I took a bite of the chicken and whatever flavoring was nonexistent. It was not spicy and really had no taste. I added some soy sauce to the brown rice and for brown rice, it didn't taste good either. I ended up taking just a few bites and leaving the rest. I will reluctantly give them a second chance since I did try something new, but I really wouldn't recommend what I got to anyone."}
{"text":"Fresh Pei Wei quality. Great service. Friendly and efficient. The guy who took my take out order even brought my meal outside to me when he saw I was stuck on the phone. Now that's customer service!"}
{"text":"First, Reno folks don't try to find a Pei Wei in Reno because we don't have one. We do have its older, pricier, food not as good a value cousin, P F Chang's.  Pei Wei has great food and appetizers, reasonably priced. We had the crab Rangoon and Thai chicken Spring rolls. The peanut dipping sauce for the spring rolls was heavenly and the sweet and sour sauce for the crab had a bit of a kick to it. Both were palate pleasing. My usual order is the seared honey chicken. It never disappoints, and has chunks of white meat only, seared in a spicy honey sauce, with your choice of rice: white, brown, or fried. My only regret when I have the opportunity to enjoy a meal at Pei Wei is that we don't have one in Reno!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that Pei Wei was as good as it was. I ordered the Asian Chicken salad, small was big enough to fill me up, and my husband got the Kung Pao chicken. Small size salad was big enough to fill me up along with a cup of Wonton Soup. Kung pao was spicy but it was labeled as such. Would go back again. This location was VERY fast at getting the orders out and was very clean."}
{"text":"Pei ... have you lost your Wei? 

Not sure what was going on last night... working late, so called over to \"my\" Pei Wei to grab a Pei Wei spicy Chicken with Brown Rice and Salad Rolls... Well, they have the Chicken, NO Salad Rolls... funny....now I don't even see them on the menu... So, with great disappoint I ordered pot-stickers... guess what... out of them also... weird... how do they run out of these items at 7 PM? 

So I just go with the Spicy Chicken ... fine, but noticed a lot less chicken and MUCH smaller sized chicken chunks then normal... The host assured me that this was an isolated instance... but I wonder... things seem to changing everywhere. The favor was the norm... sweet yet spicy glaze with breaded chicken... my favorite... not bad all in all... I'm sure my doctor would say otherwise!... ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Pei Wei fits the bill after a long day running around showing property. I like to order their broccoli with ginger and chicken on top. Brown rice and sauce on side. When you order the sauce on the side, it's not heavy. It's healthy and light."}
{"text":"The food was really bad... but even worse was their customer service... they pretty much scammed me. I placed a to go order online and prepaid it. I made a large order of crab wonton and instead they put some old gross looking small order of edamame...also no dipping sauce or anything for the egg rolls ... when I called to complain about my appetizers they were oh you can come get your money back tomorrow...(like 3$) no apologies no nothing... they were rude and the food was terrible..."}
{"text":"I normally only go on yelp to write reviews of places that are amazing but I am so disappointed with my experience at this Pei Wei location that I needed to post this. I order the same exact thing every single time: the honey seared chicken with brown rice and four crab wontons. This time I received the chicken soggy with the breading falling off and zero sauce on the chicken. The brown rice was burnt and the wontons tasted like they were a day old. My boyfriend got the chicken fried rice and half of the rice was still white meaning they did not mix the soy sauce through out. All of the vegetables were raw and there was little to no flavor. Needless to say it will be a very long time before we try eating at Pei Wei again."}
{"text":"Tried to place a to-go order tonight called six times since 4pm and they won't answer their phone. My daughter wanted to try it again even though the last time she placed a to go order they closed 10 minutes early and she couldn't get her order. Last time I'm coming here. Too bad, food is good."}
{"text":"Always a satisfying food from here. And when I ask for extra sauce, no extra charge-no problem. I would probably eat here weekly if there's a near by location. Maybe one day. I definitely recommend this place for Chinese food it's the only one I would eat from. They also have gf menu if preferred..."}
{"text":"Came in today to get my usual orange peel chicken. 

Today it was LIGHTLY drizzled with the sauce which made it not as good when adding hit mustard. 

But I've never had a problem before so."}
{"text":"Worst Pei wei! So disappointing. We have been going to Pei Wei for several years! This one on Summit is horrible. The Caramel Chicken (Tofu) we ordered had a side salad that was so old and wilted. I'll be posting pics to show. The portion is small for a Regular... unlike other locations! It was always well presented. This one was not! We were hungry and most food would taste good, but since we know what it should taste like, we knew this is not how t should be. We have traveled across the country and all other Pei Wei had the same taste for Caramel Chicken (Tofu) except this location. The salad side is normal the highlight as it's fresh and has cilantro and crunchy cucumbers and carrots. They need to pay attention to this location."}
{"text":"Nice setup, hard to find a parking spot, and the food, too american to be consider real Asian food especially the Pad Thai, terrible!  Need I say more. Other restaurants in the area that are so much better in so many ways."}
{"text":"I ordered the Honey Seared Chicken. It was absolutely delicious! Along with the delicious food they accidentally made my meal twice. I got double the food for one price. Thank you Chris! Very kind of you. I appreciate the kind experience I received. What caring service. (:"}
{"text":"Since they changed the menu awhile back I don't go as much. When I do go I'll get the honey seared chicken and some lettuce wraps. Staff has always been friendly."}
{"text":"This place is like a Panera Bread or Dickey's BBQ, one of those chain restaurants where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you your table.  It's a tad bit more \"upscale\" than a Panda Express (I said 'tad bit') but it's stil fast food.  And it is for sure an \"American\" Chinese hang out.

I like the concept because it keeps costs down and you can get in and get out.... However, the food.... ohh... sooooo salty.  It's like licking a salt lick....  If you want to retain water for a good 2 days, go to this place!  I'd order the Korean beef stir fry and it was so salty, I had to drink 2 glasses of ice tea to calm myself... Now, I get to wear my fat jeans for awhile!"}
{"text":"Something is seriously wrong!! 

I am a fan Pei Wei.  I have been for years, but so far I have been here a few times and each time to food is terrible.  I'm not sure what is wrong with the cooks, but everything is always far to spicy.  One week I'll order the sesame chicken from the gilbert location and it's excellent.  Then I go to this location off of Queen Creek and the sauce is mainly just soy sauce with no other flavor except salt.  I have even asked if they could remake my dish and it still comes back tasting the same.  

I like a few chain restaurants because I can always bank on the quality being consistent , but not here.  Safe to say I will never come back to this location. Even though it's closer to my home I'd rather drive 20 minutes out of my way."}
{"text":"Best Asian service around! They make any change I want to my meal with a smile every time. I eat here every week."}
{"text":"These guys are so amazing! I call and order for a group of 33 people and ask that the food be ready in a hour. Pei wei doesn't flinch a bit! \"Absolutely!\" They say..... Fantastic service! Delicious food! Amazing customer service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit grossed out sitting here waiting for an order. Currently I'm watching the girl cooking wipe her nose with her glove and continue cooking! Then the girl in front gave a little girl a sauce she dropped on the floorGross!!"}
{"text":"I really like that they have small plates now. The Honey Seared Sauce is my favorite :)"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience here, neither with food nor service. Yum! I highly recommend the Sea Bass, if you can afford a little extra."}
{"text":"Shame on this NON \"Pei Wei Pei Wei.\"  This new \"concept\" needs to go IMMEDIATELY.  They don't have a lot of the most popular menu items from real Pei Weis.  

Furthermore, the Manager is horrible, snotty, and unhelpful."}
{"text":"I have always loved Pei Wei, and I have been going to this location since it opened in my neighborhood almost 10 years ago. However, over the past few years I've found the food and service quality deteriorate into what it is today. My family has stopped going to this location altogether. My father requested orange chicken and chow mein, which they said they couldn't do. I've never heard of a Chinese food restaurant that couldn't accommodate such a standard request. I've seen a server texting on their phone in front of customers, only to be promoted to a supervisor the next time I went in. 

Going to Pei Wei used to be an experience. Now, it's just another restaurant in the neighborhood that doesn't distinguish itself from any other. If you want Pei Wei as it should be, go to the new Metrocenter location that opened recently."}
{"text":"Walked into this location Wednesday had to use the ladies room before I ordered and found vomit in the sink... Told the employees they started arguing about who was going to clean it. Very unprofessionally handled."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is always friendly and the food is delicious. I felt like today deserved a review because I only did take out and the staff still gave me amazing service. Even offered me a drink during my wait (most higher end restaurants don't even do that!)."}
{"text":"I ordered spicy Korean with veg's & tofu today. Pretty good although I didn't catch the \"signature dish \" as it say. I found few slices of mushrooms. I think this sauce is match with the mushrooms. 
The service is fast!!"}
{"text":"I called this one correctly.  Received the customary reply from PEI Wei about contacting them.  I replied to their url link,not let's see if anything happens."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars because the food is consistently really really good. I mean like really good haha. I often switch it up from the Pei Wei spicy to the sesame chicken to the lettuce wraps which are all amazing! Also I have to applaud the cooking staff on their lightning like service, even when it's packed in there the food comes out in 5 minutes or less! But here are my complaints: 1. The servings are pretty small. I always feel like I could eat more after I get a regular size, and the larges are pretty pricey for the amount of food you get. 2. There silverware just seems dirty. I often pick out silverware with food on it and it definitely ruins the experience. Anyways I would definitely recommend just check your silverware :)"}
{"text":"Been going here since they opened. We usually get the noodle dishes (pad thai). I like Pei Wei's version of Pad Thai. Never had a bad experience. The food and service has been good. It's been less busy lately. I think some of the bad reviews come from the \"new money\" Summerlin A-holes in their leased Mercedes (the same ones waiting for an hour in the gas line at Costco next store in order to save a buck). I love how some of the reviews are saying it's not Asian enough. That's the whole point of the place. It's Americanized fusion. If you want stinky rancid oil vapor dripping down the walls and cock roaches, head over to some place on Spring Mountain and Decatur."}
{"text":"Usually lunch is so fast, by the time you've filled your drink and select a seat - they bring your food.  Dinner, in my experience, hasn't quite the same urgency.  From time to order to the time my food came was a surprising 40 minutes.  I should have ordered more wine.  This is unusual, unless I usually only come for lunch and they focus on busting out food at breakneck speed - and for dinner perhaps they slow down.  

Regardless, I'm happy with the menu changes: small/large plates, and as always appreciate the vegetarian/vegan options.  The food continues to be consistently good."}
{"text":"Not being a big fan of Chinese food myself, I decided to humor my partner in crime and try something of her choosing this Friday evening. After hearing my parents and food snob brother rant about the one in Avondale, I figured being a chain, it couldn't be much worse (or better) at this location.

Since I was hungry (having not eaten all day due to my sensitive piercing [see my review for HTC]) we ordered 2 apps (edamame and the chicken lettuce wraps), for our entrees she had the Kung Pao chicken while I had the Thai coconut curry shrimp.

The edamame came out pretty quickly, but were kinda \"over-reheated\" although fairly tasty. The lettuce wraps were OK. While the lettuce was great and very crisp and fresh, the chicken mixture was a little overdone and underseasoned. I've had better lettuce wraps at BJ's, to be totally honest.

Out came the entrees and again, nothing special, but not bad. The chicken in her entree was, again, a little overcooked but not enough to make it inedible...I personally thought they were a little stingy with the peanuts, but the flavor was OK. Enough heat to make the dish enjoyable but not hot enough that you would start sweating profusely.

My coconut curry shrimp smelled delicious and tasted the same. They definitely aren't stingy with the protein in either entree we tried. My only gripe with my entree was that it came out a little on the cool side, and without seeing any visible peppers, the seasoning throughout was a little inconsistent...a few bites would have no heat at all, then I'd fish out a shrimp and chomp away and I'd be in tears due to the spice.

So, I wouldn't say it was good enough to change my opinion of Chinese food, but it was definitely a nice change of pace and I would go back again. 4 stars down to 3 as the cashier/order taker was a little snotty and impatient for my taste."}
{"text":"I am stunned. I have read reviews and people say it is just like PF Changs. Whoa I don't think so. I was in the process of ordering online but since this was the first time I wanted to make sure they made it the crispy shrimp they advertise instead of just shrimp as it is on their online menu. I phoned the order in and told them crispy shrimp, with emphasis...instead when I got home I received soggy \"honey glazed\" chicken, which almost indefinitely was simply sweet and sour sauce. I was hoping to order a Mongolian style beef but since their Mongolian sauce is not spicy as indicated, I tried the black pepper instead and unfortunately they only have \"steak\" not beef. And it was the lowest quality of steak I have ever had, no exaggeration, it was literally beef jerky chunks, and to top it off (literally) it was layed over soggy fried rice (due to the black pepper sauce).  I am shocked people like their meals on top of each other like that.  Even Panda Express separates their dishes.  The lo mein noodles really didn't differ from Panda express except that it had some veggies here and there and dumped a cup of sugar in it, and for $9 with bland \"crispy\" yet dry chicken I will say that it was another disappointment.  The Thai peanut sauce tasted like something my young child would make, unedible.  I hope you don't waste your money here, BJ's restaurant is right there, as well as Islands, NY Pizza which has some of the best pizzas in town."}
{"text":"I had to call three times before someone answered to place my order. I ordered double chicken and double veggies for over $14.00. And my bowl was half full. It's always hit or miss at this location, I'm not going back. And I just opened my fortune cookie to NO FORTUNE inside. Today is not my day, for Pei Wei"}
{"text":"Came tonight and just observed how dirty the floor was, the Bauer was just wiping the table waste on the Floor; fortune cookie wrappers, straws, napkins and food.

Just so surprised, we sat and just watched in disbelief.
When we left we asked to talk with the manager and he really did nothing about the issue.  Pretty sad don't think we will be back. We will drive to the other locations"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife...we ordered the new sushi they were advertising, edamame, sesame chicken and drinks. I received the sushi and it was ROTTEN!!! It tasted like it had been pre made and sat in the cooler for a few days to spoil. I notified the manager and told him that it looked like it had been sitting for a few days...THE MANAGER TOLD ME \"YES, IT ACTUALLY WAS MADE A FEW DAYS AGO\" OMG!!!! Are you trying to kill me? Needless to say..I will not go back..."}
{"text":"I was excited to give Pei Wei another try after writing it off years ago. I was under the impression that there was a Coke Freestyle machine at *all* Pei Wei's... (not most, lol).. but noo. No such luck. I ordered the Chicken Coconut Curry with brown rice. While I'm not expecting Pei Wei to serve up the most authentic grub, my meal felt haunted by overtones of a Stouffer's TV Dinner, circa 1989. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mongolian Beef with Noodles, Crab Ragoon everything was on point!!!!  The steak from the Mongolian Beef was very tender and Crab Ragoons the best with the Dipping sauce. Received comp drinks while we waited Free is always good! Many beverage selections a plus. So glad they opened this location will definitely be back. PEI WEI the only Wei"}
{"text":"Honey Shrimp, Gioza, Egg Rolls and a beer while Im waiting. I love pei wei and its near my crib"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. First time I came here & ordered the spicy Korean from the lunch menu. There wasn't much flavor to the dish other than being spicy. The rice was dry,the chicken was dry. You're better off at panda express. 2 stars for the nice decor & friendly service."}
{"text":"Not my favorite but 5$ orange chicken you get what you pay for. It's a fast casual concept not much more
To explain. Service is friendly enough. But no restaurant maintenance and messy drink stations.
Just part of what you expect."}
{"text":"I love their sushi, but tonight was such a cluster f#@*, I had to voice a complaint.

We ordered to pick up the party plater, but everyones orders were so screwed up we paid for two four piece servings and left. 
Why are we hiring 15 year olds without even a manager present.
Oh well, please pay an experienced adult to take orders next time.

Next week when I need a sushi fix I will be going to Sam's Club, Harris Teeter, Publix...."}
{"text":"Called tonight. Very busy. Waited 10 minutes and they hung up on me. Called again. Another 10, another hang up. Called again (sucker), same 10 same,
hang up. Went to the restaurant. Empty. Kid working counter states they're super busy. Asked for manager, was referred to line cook."}
{"text":"I submitted a Web Order this evening of November 26th, picked up my food at 6:03pm. 
When I got home, I was disappointed to see that my Chicken Lettuce Wraps were missing. We are a family of 4 with two young kids. I was counting on my order being complete to have a full decent meal for everyone. 
To add to my frustration, this Pei Wei location DOES NOT answer their phones!! I made multiple attempts being put on hold to a incredibly irritating hold recording, \"Thank you for calling Pei Wei Asian Diner, please wait as we are assisting other guests.\" This was on a constant fast repeat as I waited over 10 minutes (!!!) and finally gave up. I called 4 times at various times. The last attempt was at 8:30pm. How can that be pleasant for anyone to listen to and how can any place of business, especially a take-out restaurant, not answer their phones??? We will not be dining at Pei Wei anymore. The food was overly salty anyway."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing! This DD girl had exceptional service and a great attitude! But sadly, the food took 30 minutes. Very upsetting. Great food though!"}
{"text":"I placed a to go order today and the order was incorrect. I requested no rice sticks (but you can see in the photo there are definitely rice sticks). Also ordered it spicy, but it had no spice whatsoever. My receipt shows the requests, but the food was still made wrong."}
{"text":"I went during the week and my meal had lots of color and was hot and fresh. Was so happy. It got full fast.was a great vist.
But then I went with my brother on Saturday and told him they have really cold beer. To my surprise the food was sloppy not
A good looking plate. No effort in making the meals. Sad.i ask if they had WIFI and they told me they didn't know.lame.but I found it.
On my own. Then I wasn't credit 4 my online coupon. Was mad about that.the good part about this visit was I made my brother 
Happy with a good cold beer. So maybe the cook's that work during the week try harder. I like 2 give those cook's"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! The food is always fresh and service is great. I like that they know what I usually order when I call ahead and they always accommodate my requests. The Mongolian chicken is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place was good in the beginning until i got a server that does not speak english. I also ordered DOUBLE meat and they decided to come to my table and tell me that it was already put on. The girl manager that came needs to understand what customer service means in the food industry. I am NEVER coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Great food, & friendly service. I've tried several of their dishes, but prefer the lo-mein category; the children's lo-mein is actually quite good. Not sure why pei wei gets negative ratings, but I enjoy this place as much as I do Tott's Asian Diner. Both are great places to eat at. It'd be nice if pei wei had listed open/closed hours though."}
{"text":"Our family loves to come here every weekend.   The food is always delicious and the people that work there are always friendly. #lovepeiwei"}
{"text":"My noodles where flavorless as there was no sauce on my food. I ordered shrimp with teriyaki noodles.  The shrimp was delicious and had great flavor. My son ordered the same thing except the kid version and his noodles were a completely different color because he had teriyaki sauce in his! I asked for some more sauce. I was told sure no problem. I sat for about 10-15 min while my noodles got cold. Still no sauce. The server I asked had run to the bathroom and was in there for about a good 15-20 min. Before he came out I asked someone else. Same thing they said, no problem I'll bring it to you. Still no sauce. So I ate my cold noodles and left."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service there are Or employees then the guest in the place, and still there is more than an hour wait to get food. Nobody seems to care. Nobody came and apologized."}
{"text":"I love their Orange Peel Steak and Pei Wei is one of my favorite lunch spots. That being said, the service at this location was not great. They were not that busy but the wait for my to-go order was over 30 minutes! A lunch rush is understandable but while waiting I could see my ready food sitting on the counter waiting to be put in a bag for me. They did apologized for the wait, though."}
{"text":"Went to the the pei Wei on Scottsdale and double tree, the same one we have always gone too for almost two years. My girlfriend, whom suffers with celiac disease, wanted to order the sweet and sour bowl with gluten free tofu that she always gets. every single time they have told us that they can make the tofu gluten free. this time, the manager (Stacy) told us that the tofu can not be made gluten free and they have never been able to make it gluten free (which confuses me becuase why can't you just fry it with tarmari!! which I'm assuming they've done in the past...) and that she probably has been poisined all the last times we've gone (even though she's never gotten sick from it). Very confusing service, I would rather talk to a chef about what ingredients are being cooked rather than the manager. we still love you pei Wei but please tell us exactly what is going into our food."}
{"text":"We have gone to this Pei Wei many many times now. Sometimes it's good, sometimes there is too much sauce, etc. etc. like you would expect at any fast casual place. However, last night something happened that made me decide I would never eat there again.
I suffer from a moderate shellfish allergy. I always advise the cashier and chef of this fact. I have a couple normal safe dishes I order. However, last night I asked about the Chicken Lo Mein. My husband often orders this and I've really wanted to try it. I asked the cashier and she informed me that it was fine. I then asked her to verify with the chef because often asian food contains fish sauce, which shellfish allergy sufferers cannot consume. 
The chef verified that it was indeed fine, so we ordered and took our food home. I was eating my food and encountered a chunk of charcoal in it (maybe from the grill?) which set off a bit of gagging on my end. I decided that was probably the only piece, and I was tired and didn't want to return to the restaurant, so I continued eating. As I was eating I noticed my throat was getting sore. I thought that it must have been the gagging that caused it. However it wasn't much longer until I was wheezing.
I went to their website to check allergy info and saw that the lo mein is clearly marked as a shellfish allergen. I have now spent last night and my entire day today wheezing. Now, imagine I didn't have a moderate allergy, and instead I had one where I might need an epi-pen. I COULD LITERALLY BE DEAD. I wish that people could understand that food allergies are serious, and not something to just brush off. 
Obviously, shame on me for going to an asian restaurant anyway...but geeze. So please, please, please, if you have serious food allergies, DO NOT EAT HERE. Allergies are not taken seriously here, and you could die."}
{"text":"Had Caramel Chicken with noodles. It was a super-busy lunch. Everything was smooth and expedited quickly. Lunch was great and was out of there in time to get to where I needed to be. Excellent staff, clean dining area, and amazing food! Thank you Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this Pei Wei since it opened. Someone needs to give them a wake up call! We have brought several areas of concern to their attention but instead of addressing them, more keep coming up. Soon they will join their sister restaurant on Broadway on Dirty Dining.  First, there has been a broken table on the patio for months. The table top is so unsteady that it almost falls on your lap. Their way of fixing it is to leave it on the patio and turn chairs upside down on top of it. Now when you sit at a few tables around it you have dirty chair legs in your face! 
Next, the Chili Paste jars. They are filthy! No matter what time we arrive to eat they have caked-on, dried, dripping sauce on the opening to pour the paste out of. Even at 10:45 am when we would be the first customers of the day. Because the paste is so thick they have started to water it down. This changes the flavor. We now ask for to-go containers of the sauce to eat in the restaurant. 
The modern soda machine must never get cleaned. It has so much build up on the back splash area that it almost makes you skip a beverage.  The Ice selection is always breaking. 
The service is very inconsistent. We usually have a group of 3 or 4. The delivery of the food can very up to 15 to 20 minutes with no appetizers ordered. Many times a couple of us are almost done when the remaining few get their food. 
Also, keep in mind that the servers do not wash their hands after clearing dirty dishes from tables. We always hope that the dirty dishes do not have any serious illness germs on them. 
The quality of food also needs to improve.  The last Egg Rolls we ordered were still a little frozen in the middle and grainy. It appears that no one taste tests the food throughout the day. The sauces on the dishes changes a lot day to day. I order my salad dressing on the side. When the wrong dressing comes to the table I have to convince the server that I would like the correct sauce and they try to always tell me it is the correct sauce. Then they eventually bring the right sauce.
We have contacted Pei Wei's corporate office and left our number for them to call but they never did. We left concerns with PF Chang's but no one replied. Maybe this will get some one's attention.
This review gets one star so I can post the review, but it earns no stars."}
{"text":"I ordered the $5 General Tsos with brown rice in a bowl, but it didn't come in a bowl. It actually came on a plate. Not sure exactly why, but it was fine by me. 

Pretty fast delivery of food to our table when it was about 1 p.m. in the afternoon with several people at the location.

The General Tsos had several of those really hot red chili peppers hanging out on my dish. You know the ones. The ones that you don't want to bite into unless you're ready to have a mild heart attack. My dish of chicken was definitely spicy, but not to the point that it burnt my lips, so all is good. I didn't eat those chili peppers. No way. 

The brown rice was good, especially when I mixed it up with the little green spring onions and sauce from the General Tsos. 

The price is definitely a winner for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"Sadly I'm having to report on our awful experience. This is my opinion of the situation on our Monday afternoon. There should not be 2 people staffed to take on the influx of people in line or pickup. The kitchen looked busy and bustling so they were working, but there seemed to be minuscule amounts of flow. The customer service was a slight disappointment. The gentlemen in front of us was at the front to have his order taken for the better part of 10 minutes with nobody talking to him. Unfortunately we left this time because of service that was not up to par and it took 30 minutes just to get through the line and we had heard other clients that ordered 45 minutes before that time that hadn't got their food yet. Several years I've been giving them a try but I doubt we'll be back to this one."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today, got my order wrong (receipt was correct), so I called and they fixed it right for me. Other than that, food was good, but four stars because of that mishap."}
{"text":"This would be a daily stop for us! Pei Wei Spicy Stock Velvet and Brown Rice. Very good for us. And now that we are down in weight, we share a dinner portion and are stuffed. Makes lunch very affordable at 20 bucks for three people.

On a sad note, we pulled a bag wrapper out of our meal a few weeks ago. :(

Update: Will note that today's water cup was full of something unpleasant that dried to the side, thank God I looked before I drank it. Plus our sons order was incorrect and we where charged for an adult meal instead of a kids. No mention of refund and late getting to an appointment, so we could do nothing about it. That's two strikes. One more and we won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Totally loved this place. They have everything. It's  plant based, gluten free and vegan friendly. Proportions were very generations and the lady running the food is extremely helpful and friendly. My husband had chicken Chow Mein with noodles and I had the ginger broccoli with brown rice, and 5 spice tofu. Delicious! I greatly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not happy with my food.  Chicken was horrible. I ended up throwing it away. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Placed an order to go, lettuce wraps and lo me in bowl, was told that it would take just 5 minutes. It was very slow inside, saw a bag come out after 5 mins but they didn't say anything to me so I guessed it was for someone else. Another 10 minutes pass and the cashier glances at the bag and calls out my name??? I'm the only one waiting for my order!! I told her the bag has been sitting there for a while for no reason and she just stated that it just came out! Oh well. Now I get home and the one thing you would want with lettuce wraps is missing, how can you forget the lettuce?!? My mistake for going there late I guess. Ps thanks for not leaving me with any utensils or napkins! Just perfect since my kitchen is getting redone and is currently torn apart"}
{"text":"Lines were a bit long, but that's to be expected at lunch hour rush. The service was good. Very attentive and courteous. Tables clean and wiped off very quickly so others could sit and enjoy their meals. Food tasted a little mass produced and bland. Even with chili... I won't shy away, but not a first choice."}
{"text":"This is the worst Pei Wei I have ever encountered. The last two times I have tried to order take out they phone rang for 8 and 17 minutes, then just to make it even worse ... having ordered chicken pad-thai they instead gave me tofu pad thai. I called to talk to the manager and they said there was no manager on call ... really ? They said I would get a call back the next day ... 72 hours later still no call. 
Bad customer service
Not worth the effort ... there are lots of other food places on 7th ave and McDowell ..."}
{"text":"I've never considered myself a monster, but after tasting the snicker doodle and chocolate chip cookies at  Pei Wei  on Glendale and 7th Street - I've taken on a new personae.  

I AM a cookie monster. Just crazy enough to live from cookie sheet to mouth. Forget about nutritiously balanced meals packed with varieties of fruits and vegetables in my other reviews - they're over-rated. 

Needless to say, you probably expected to read a review of the food. Sorry, this is about cookies. I can't review the food. I still haven't eaten it. I have no appetite for it. The plate is sitting there staring at me.
 
My plan was to have a pinch of the cookies. Seriously, just a nibble. But in cookie monster world, there is no such thing as a pinch or a nibble and before I could stop myself cookies were gobbled up. Gone! Just crumbs everywhere.

The snicker doodle cookie was soft and perfectly baked with a generous topping of cinnamon brown sugar. Usually I'm not a fan of excess sugar but it worked for this one. What's more is - the doodle was stuffed! with bits of nuts I think. At first I thought pieces of dried fruit because the smell reminded me of apple pie. 

The chocolate chip cookie was soft and perfectly baked with a generous amount of chips but not overkill so I enjoyed the taste of cookie in every scrumptious bite.

Most importantly, my hands were not oily after eating so the baker knows his / her sh*t about the science of recipe measurements. No wonder these were so damn good.

I hope to have more cookies as good as these next time.

{"text":"What can I say about Pei Wei.  I am kinda pissed that they moved from Fountain Hills to the new location.  The old location was closer to my house.  The new building is very nice though, and it was designed for speed.  They have lots of people working, and lots of registers.  The food at all Pei Wei locations is the same as far as I know.  I really like their food and the concept."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs.

This is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much, especially since it's more of a counter service experience."}
{"text":"Very very salty and overseasoned. If you know Asian food and appreciate it in it's true form...don't go here. If you like the Americanized, PF Changs version of chinese food then by all means..."}
{"text":"Great food! Pad Thai is awesome and the lo mein and especially the fried rice with shrimp fast sort of cheap and tons of flavor!"}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Chicago a couple of times and didn't write a great review. This location is actually pretty good. We started out with egg rolls, sesame chicken and mandarian beef (I think). The chicken was good, not overly salty like what I'm used to. The beef was a little tough and chewy. It's close to our home so I'm sure we'll go again when we don't feel like cooking.

We went at 5:30 on Sunday evening and it was packed for both take out and dining in. Be prepared to wait for a little while. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"First time at Pei Wei, ordered online and signed up for their club as well. The hostess was friendly but could not find my order. She said it would only take a few minutes. My order came out promptly and I decided to eat in rather than home. The food was hot and looked pretty good. The Mongolian beef was a dollar upgrade and was so overcooked it reminded me of jerky with a few mushrooms and green onions. The fried rice was another 50 cent upgrade and another letdown as it was half fried and half white clumps. I hope it was just a bad day for the cook and since I am now a member of their club which awards me a free large beverage, I will try again, I sure hope it is better next visit."}
{"text":"For a fast casual restaurant, you can't complain about this place. It's fast, clean, decently priced, semi-healthy and tastes great. Cant ask for much more."}
{"text":"Why is it that when i arrive here my eyes become far more bigger than my stomach?

Awesome pot-stickers and lettuce wraps.

Really good service, very friendly and most accommodating.

Comfortable atmosphere.

Kind of a cluster in getting your own drink and makes me wonder if i still have to tip or not."}
{"text":"This Pei Wei is a mixed bag.  Really nice looking place - especially for a fast food restaurant.  Diverse menu, but surprisingly not very healthy being heavy on the fried and light on the veggies.  Prices not bad, especially in NoSco.  Servers are treated like idiots.  My girl had to stand around for 5 minutes doing nothing while she waited for the one person they entrusted with The Card That Can Issue Refunds to give me my refund when the girl with The Card overcharged me - needless to say, I was standing around, too.  Lots of food on the plate so I definitely left full.  A-OK"}
{"text":"This is terrible food. I've had some not so great Chinese food before, but this place is by far the worst. It doesn't help to call it \"asian\" to avoid authenticity complaints. It's just bad. The beef must have been soaking in soy sauce for a week. I love salty food, but I developed hypertension after eating here. The sweet sauce in the \"General Chi\" style (whatever that is) was entirely too sweet to pass for anything. The beef was very tough and completely overcooked. The Orange chicken was the only mildly redeeming dish because I could eat more than a few bites without being overwhelmed with salt or sugar. I don't mean to overstated this: it was the worst meal I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is pretty good eats, and you always know what you are going to get.  The food is good quality, the place is well run, and it's clean.  

They have a pretty good selection of veggie items, and I really like how they prepare tofu (it's like, baked & grilled... or something).  Plus, their orange iced-tea is really tasty."}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest service here. There is not a manager in sight and everybody is running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Since the good manager left a few years ago this store has seriously struggled."}
{"text":"Let's see... Where to start... This place has been around forever. I remember working at an ice cream joint next door (now L&L Hawaiian BBQ) when this place opened. It used to be our go to place during our lunch break. This place is located across Red Rock Casino at the Pavilion center plaza... 

I'll be honest, I'm probably going to be a little biased on this review since this is one of my favorite places to go grub when I'm around the Summerlin area. My friends, family and myself have been eating at this restaurant since 2004 when it opened. 10 years and I'm just now writing a review... Haha. 

Considering I've been a regular at this joint,  most of the employees know me and they usually have an idea what I'm going to get. This makes it a biased review simply because my experience is going to be different than someone who checked in for the first time... 

Just so you know, if you walk in this restaurant expecting authentic Asian food, you're going to be disappointed. This is more like an \"Americanized\" version and a little more casual than PF Chang, which by the way is a sister company. 

One of my all time favorite is the chicken Phad Thai. For the price you pay, you get a very decent portion. Sometimes I even have left overs. It's a little spicy but you can tell them how spicy you want it if you're not into hot stuff. Everything is fresh and made to order. You can actually see the cooks prepare your food behind the bar type counter and decor. Some of the other house favorites is also something I would recommend. The  \"Pei Wei Spicy\", \"Honey Seared \" and \" Caramel Chicken\" are all savory dishes. Some of my friends enjoy the \"Mongolian\" but I personally find it too salty for my taste. Mind you, all the dishes are customized to your liking. You get to pick what protein and what type of rice or noodles you want. 

With all that said, Pei Wei is a very simple conceptual restaurant. It's very casual. I don't consider myself a food connoisseur... As long as I enjoy the experience and the food suits my taste, I'm all for it."}
{"text":"Over an hour and a half for a takeaway order. Only 3 tables occupied inside and staff confused and not efficient.  Food is good but not worth the wait"}
{"text":"The baby of P. F. Changs, Pei Wei offers pan Asian fast food.   The dishes offer more vegetables than the neighborhood Chinese joints.  You can make it as spicy as you want with the pan Asian condiments of spicy mustard and spicy red sauce.  Our location now includes the multi-flavor soda machine where you can not only get coke, but also cherry coke, coke vanilla, and cherry vanilla coke.  It's fast.  It's not particularly healthy.  It's Asian.  It's kid friendly.  It's East of Usual and located in Tempe on East Guadalupe Road.  It was open between 3 PM and 5 PM when nothing else was.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"Great experience at this location. Hector is a rock star! We had a large group and he helped us out with everything. Even things that were not his job. Like cleaning few messes.... kids. We will return soon!"}
{"text":"I've talked about the concept of \"vaguely Asian\" in other reviews, but seeing as how they're for places a continent away, I'll honor you desert-dwellers with a phenomenon my fellow Atlantans suffer through on a nigh weekly basis: the Crazy Ivan.

Back to \"Vaguely Asian,\" it can apply to many things: food, restaurants, movies, Olivia Munn on \"Attack of the Show.\" Mostly it's the practice of mixing up benign stereotypes in a way that satisfies one's notion of location or expectations while not actually being accurate at all.  For example, I've eaten at countless barely passable \"Chinese\" joints in mall food courts that, other than their liberal use of soy sauce (mostly manufactured in Southern California) are technically about as Chinese Hong Kong Phooey.  But it's just Asian ENOUGH to satisfy most people.   Now when I say \"most people\" I don't mean those Japanophiles or Sinophiles or anybody with enough yellow fever that they get all huffy when you include Kurosawa in with Woo or any other of the Hong Kong oeuvre.  Oh, and Asians too. I assume \"vaguely Asian\" probably isn't enough to satisfy most Asians of which I am one though only vaguely.

However, Asians themselves can be faulted for this feeding into the Vaguely Asian experience.  I used to frequent, only because of its proximity to my office, a terrible Chinese place that served sushi but was run by a Vietnamese guy.   Add in a few Korean waiters and me, the Filipino customer, and it was the Pacific Rim of Crapitude.  It was as if thousands of years of pan Asian culture had been boiled down into a single crucible of misery and suck represented by rubbery lo mein and rice not fit to be given out by UNICEF. And yet curiously, I found comfort in all this. It was all so pleasantly vaguely Asian.

Then again, my mother sometimes complains that I'm too American for her taste.

Anyway, I knew all this when I went to Pei Wei. I didn't expect much in the way of authenticity. Actually I didn't expect ANY authenticity. I expected a lot of rice, soy sauce and ginger in odd places. I expected Vaguely Asian and, well, that's what I got. OK, it's not quite to the whitewashed level of say, a Panda Express, but I sure as hell ain't gonna find any chicken feet boiling away here.

The space was nice. Nods to authenticity if not attempts to actually meet it. (Unused) woks hanging decoratively from hooks, dark woods and the obligatory chopsticks which, really, are impossible to eat with unless the rice is sticky.  The set-up is fast casual which indeed is fast, but always puts into question whether to tip or not.  Dishes range from \"Thai\" to \"Korean\" to \"Chinese\" and, well, they're really not any of the three, but it's good enough for government work.  I kept thinking to myself, \"Man, this is like visiting a poor man's P.F. Chang's,\" when lo and behold, I discovered it WAS a poor man's P.F. Chang's as in, they're sister chains. Ah so, Grasshopper.

 In all, it wasn't HORRIBLE per se. The food was edible if not impressive. Since none of the dishes were over $10, the prices weren't that bad. The many, many, (sigh) many kids around me seem to be digging it.  The service was perky (though the cashier made me feel older than McCain's grandpa.) Finally they had Sapporro in large bottles which helped me to handle the many, many, (sigh), many kids around me.  So if your knowledge of China is less Sun Tzu and more General Tso, then you'll do fine here. I'll give it 2.5 stars and round up because, hey, I'm visiting."}
{"text":"The dishes are unusually large and are very good.  My wife and I were expecting a stereotypically fast food type of lunch, but were delighted to have quickly served, fresh-cooked, delicious food.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was kinda hungry, and on my way out for NYE, and decided to pick up some dinner to keep the stomach quiet.  I decided on pei wei, and enjoyed my experience.  I guess its supposed to be a low key version of PF changs, and the food and decor was just as nice as the PF changs resturants.

Service was quick, location was clean, dinner was tasty.  I got the sweet and sour chicken, and the servings were huge!  I was expecting some kind of comprimise on serving size, for whatever reason, but clearly this was not the case.

I enjoyed my experience here, and would probably return if I was in the area and looking for a reliable place to eat."}
{"text":"I love the chicken teriyaki. The portions are pretty big I can get a small box and have enough for two servings."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Kung Pao Shrimp here.  I like that you can order it steamed instead of fried and that the vegetables are always fresh."}
{"text":"Fast food chinese with flair.
Way better than panda
Being a PF Chang subsidiary the food is made quickly an freshly and with some healthy attributes.
I had the Blazing Bangkok Peanut Noodle, for having the word Blazing in the title it was mild, of course most of the chinese places dumb down the heat for american flavor profiles.
Decent taste and very filing!
Felt healthy with the Swiss Chard in it :D
Great value for the portion and flavor."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices, if you like PF Changes you'll love Pei Wei. Same company and very similar food."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ordered to go at 6:40, arrived at 7:03. Told it'll be a 20 minute wait. Very annoying but whatever (accepted this as my time thing said 7:20 -- but I have come after waiting 20 minutes and it's usually always done already). Several people come and go and one girl that was already there when I got there waited next to me for 20+ minutes. I get frustrated at a point because this girl says to two of the guys that came after me \"it'll be 20 minutes\" when I had already waited at least 10 minutes, yet they get their food well before me?? The worst part is EVERY single order aside from one was literally one entree!! The one person who ordered a few entrees was only waiting on a kids meal. Absolutely ridiculous. I am sick of this Pei Wei and this was the final straw. I order regular sized adult entrees with extra chicken and no rice or garnish or anything and the chicken NEVER fills the container! I'm not even talking just to the top. I mean it doesn't even fill across the container. They are so unbelievably stingy that I HAVE to buy two orders of my entree to get a FULL chicken entree. But this was it for me. I won't be giving this lackluster Pei Wei anymore business and you should avoid this one specifically at all costs unless you want to be stiffed food wise and treated terribly customer wise. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei overall and enjoy their varied menu selections.  The food is good and fresh.  Sometimes it's hard to find a place to sit though."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to our local Pei Wei at Scottsdale Summitt in a while, but went for dinner tonight.  What a disappointment!  The place was filthy.  Never mind the uncleared and sticky tables and the stuff on the floor.  The Chinese woks and sieves hanging over the food prep area are so covered with greasy dust they look like they've grown gray hair.  OVER THE FOOD PREP.  Where are you Health Department?"}
{"text":"After I thought Pei Wei couldn't get any worse, this location exceeded my expectations!!! 

Me: \"I'd like the Pei Wei Original on noodles please\" 

Manager: \"Sorry we are out of noodles\"

Me: \"Ok, then fried rice then please\" 

Manager: \"Ok\"

Me: \"Can I get some egg rolls too?\"

Manager: \"Sorry we are out of those too\"

Me: \"Ok...how about a cup of hot and sour soup?\"

Manager: \"Ok anything else?\"

Me: \"No that will do it\"

I pay and go sit down. After about 10 minutes, a cashier comes to the table. 

Cashier: \"Did you order the hot and sour soup?\"

Me: \"Yes\" 

Cashier: \"Well we are out of hot and sour soup\" 

Me: \"Who places the food orders around here? Are you out of everything?\"

Cashier: \"I can either refund you or bring you wanton soup\" 

Me: \"I don't want wanton soup so i want a refund. What's the fastest way to do this because I'm not standing in that line to get a refund.\"

Cashier: \"The fastest thing is for you to get wanton soup\". 

I thought that was especially cute. 

After she went and refunded the soup she kindly explained that my refund won't show up for a few days and make sure I check because sometimes they don't go through. 

Pei Wei are you kidding? What's happening over there?

Oh and whoever made the decision to put chili paste in a syrup dispenser...good call on that...it really pours well."}
{"text":"They forgot to make my food after placing an order and were extremely rude when I was asking where it was 30 min after I placed it."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei Asian Diner.  I am not a big fan of this Pei Wei Asian Market concept.  It is like the diner concept, but a lot more plain.  The restaurant is smaller than the average Pei Wei, and seems to be more of a fast food atmosphere.  This location is missing the quality of the other Pei Wei restaurants.  They only offer the basic items from Pei Wei and none of the newer promotional item like the Diner Selects I was looking for.  It is missing some of the fancy touches that makes Pei Wei more desirable than Panda Express.  Food was good, but not quite what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a high quality Pei Wei, try an Asian Diner, not the Asain Market version.  Not bad to eat at, but not interesting enough to recommend."}
{"text":"Love this Pei Wei Asian Diner.  This location is close to my house and I've been here many times.  Always get great food, great service, & the atmosphere is great too.  Highly recommended.  Just as a tip, the Hong Hong BBQ Beef Diner select is my favorite dish."}
{"text":"I'm not even a veg but I go here for the soy honey chicken. Pretty tasty, and they don't take too long to make it. The quality should be a little bit better for the price but considering how fast they make it and that the portion is good it's totally fair. Great lunch place, but call ahead to order if you're going between 11-1 or you will definitely be waiting."}
{"text":"For an inexpensive casual restaurant, this one is very good.  It surprised me because I was not expecting it to be this good.  I had Thai Won Ton Soup and a Spring Roll for lunch.  The soup had excellent flavor, although they did not bother to use Thai Basil.  They used Italian basil - odd for a Thai Won Ton soup. 
Husband had vegetables and tofu over noodles, instead of over rice which is how the dish ordinarily comes.  It was also very good.  Sorry, I do not recall what it was called.  If I can get their website working and the menu to come up or when we go again, I will revise this and give you the name of it. 
The service was excellent, a tall handsome young man.  We did not know that was had to get our own cutlery and so he got it for us.  I could not find where to get a glass of water.  He got me a glass - you have to ask and then he showed me the water button, on a machine amongst what seemed like about two dozen other buttons of every imaginable soft drink. 
He was quick to bring the food, gave us a stack of serviettes and was very cheerful.  It was a very pleasant experience."}

The counter was so dusty I wrote wash me and photographed it. Bathroom was not up to par. Wine was short pour. Doubt if I will return. I wonder where managemient was."}

{"text":"I feel odd anytime I review a chain, but this particular location has set a pretty high bar for all other locations and they definitely deserve some props.

I have eaten at this location dozens of times throughout the years and have zero complaints. Seriously, not one botched order, rude employee or unhappy dining experience.

This past weekend I was partaking in a Rock Band marathon and we needed something in our bellies to keep us fueled up. It was about closing time but they had no problems making our dishes. Our food came out without any issues, piping hot and tasty, as usual. 

We were offered to-go cups in case we wanted one for the road and because we were the last people there, the extra chocolate chip cookies from the day went home with us, free of charge! 

Definitely a 5-star experience, every time!"}
{"text":"Picked up lunch to go and brought it back poolside
Was great food and really quick
Mongolian beef is the best"}
{"text":"When we walked in the place it was rather deserted which made it nice. No lines and plenty of available seating. As usual I ordered the lettuce wraps, dan dan noodles and a kids teriyaki chicken. 

This was the first time when we were looking for seats and found a large majority of the tables uncleaned. Granted there were no dishes piled up, but clearly the tabled needed a good wiped down.

Our order did take a bit longer than usual to arrive, but the food was delicious. Not sure why but we only received three pieces of lettuce for the lettuce wraps which was clearly not enough. That was kind of a let down. The teriyaki sauce tasted more like honey as opposed to the traditional teriyaki flavor.

Usually our experiences are great, but I am not sure what happened this time around."}
{"text":"i have their phone number programmed into my phone!

their lettuce wraps are just as good as p.f. chang's

their pad thai is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Try to come here because it's convenient but parking is ridiculous.   80% of the time I go there is no parking so they repeatedly lose my business.  At this point I give up.  Customer service isn't that great.  One is left to feel that they are doing you the favor of serving you since they are busy and in demand.  I give up on this place."}
{"text":"I think this is the worst Pei Wei I've been to.  The food was very bland and the whole restaurant was, for a lack of a better word... FILTHY."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not great. Definitely overpriced. It's barely a step up from Panda and not worth the price difference. Not saying it was bad, but $25 for two basic dishes is a bit much and they didn't make the order how I requested."}
{"text":"Haven't ordered from pei wei in a long time as their menu had gone down hill over the past 2 years along with the service. But am home sick and had a craving- so after looking at the menu app and seeing some new menu items all looked great.  When the order came home- there wasn't enough sauce provided for the rice bowl- there was an order item missing- and the chicken satay was disgracefully burnt and dried out."}
{"text":"The veggie tofu coconut curry is fab. Ordered with extra shrimp and extra veggies and me and my sweetheart have the perfect meal. Thank you Maggie for ensuring that we had everything we wanted. The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei - I almost always have the Orange Peel Chicken.  It was good as usual.  Husband ordered Kung Pao Chicken - it was a little weird.  Tasted like curry.  But the food was plentiful and delish and was a good two meals out of one dish."}
{"text":"Love me some Pei Wei - I like the Orange Peel chicken and always get that.  We will definitely be there again."}
{"text":"I am conflicted between two and four stars, so logically I went with three.

I do love me some Pei Wei, for several reasons. They are usually very conveniently located, you can order online, everything is yummy, they are very consistent (what you had tasted last week will be the same the next), and their quality is very good. They even have some options for reducing the calories on your favorite entrees. 

That being said I am clearly a fan, however this location has let me down a few times. Nothing major, you just might want to double check your bag before leaving with your take out. 

I requested some soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce to go with my food, he assured me they were in the bag, I took his word for it, went on my way and was very disappointed when I got home, mouth watering from the smell that enveloped my car, and saw NO sauce, of either flavor.  I was out out of soy sauce at home, so my rice was a little sad. I am not a huge fan of their sweet and sour sauce anyhow, so that wasn't a huge let down. 

My faves are the lettuce wraps (DUH!), crab wontons (very crabby, fake krab but whatev), honey seared chicken (sweet), Mongolian beef (green onions are great), and Jon likes the sweet and sour chicken (good veggies)."}
{"text":"Big fan!

This probably one of the busier ones in town and I am always in and out. I love that you can order online!!! Just quick pop online, order what you want, the web page even guids you through the manu easier, and even pick exactly when you want it to be ready.

My favorite is the lettuce wrapps and the PeiWei Spicy Chicken! Must try them!

Moral of the day, when getting take out, order online! Way fast and you even get 25% your entire order the first tiem you do. Love it!"}
{"text":"We eat at Pei Wei quite frequently and this location was, by far, the worst.  We went fairly late on a Saturday night so, while they were busy, they weren't THAT busy.  We waited over 15 minutes for our food - which they brought out separately.  My husband's arrived.  Then mine.  Then my niece's.  These were not spaced out by 1 minute - we're talking 3-5 minutes.  That is a long time for food to sit and get cold if you are being polite and waiting for others to eat.

I ordered the diner select honey seared chicken like I *always* do.  When it arrived, I counted my chicken pieces.  That's right - there were so few I counted them.  I had exactly 5 little chicken morsels (about the size of a piece of popcorn chicken) for my $6.50 + drink dinner.  I think I could have done better at Panda, thanks, and your quality isn't THAT much better that I would turn my nose up at Panda to eat your 5 chicken bites.

DH was okay with his steak - although in my opinion there wasn't enough of that either.

Overall we'll keep going to Pei Wei, but the 7th Avenue location is off our list."}
{"text":"Oh no 7th Street and Glendale Pei Wei... What has happened to you? You used to be my go to spot for take out three nights a week. But you have really gotten sloppy. I'm done.  Today was the last straw... Watery tea, two mushrooms in my mongolian chicken when I asked for extra, potstickers that taste like they were fried and stale oil, no utensils or napkins, and snotty service. Boo! The last time I let the management know what a disappointment their store was becoming they were very kind and offered me a free entrée. But that doesn't mean there have been any changes.  In fact, it's gotten worse.  Management at seventh Avenue and McDowell have it going on. I will start going back to that location."}
{"text":"I love this place! If I want a quick lunch this is the place to go. I ordered the famous  chicken lettuce wraps. ALWAYS awesome! I also ordered the fried potstickers.  I sat down, and received my lettuce wraps, but they said they were currently out of dumplings and they'd have to make them, so would I like something else. I told them I'd take them to go after they made them. I received the potstickers in about 5-10 minutes, but they forgot the sauce to dip them in. Glad I looked in the bag.  No problem, I asked at counter on my way out. But then I got back to work and LEFT them in the car. So I never got to try them! Grrrr. I will just have to go back and give it another shot! Love this place!"}
{"text":"There was only one working register tonight - and a line out the door! Brande was the person at the register and she was keeping her cool, despite how busy it was, and grumpy some customers were to her.  Way to be professional Brande - you deserve recognition for how you handled yourself."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on Saturday as we had about an hour to eat before an event.  We did not want to be late... I wanted to go to KJ's for some authentic chinese food and we ended up coming here as the event was starting and located in Summerlin.

Here we go...

a.  The Good - Ok, if you are not used to eating the real authentic chinese food, then you will like this place. It is like an upscale Panda Express with healthy foods choices and a really nice and inviting eat in environment.

- Choices - I like that they have a lot of spicy choices, and you can order many of the items on the list with Chicken, Pork, Beef, or Tofu.

- Brown Rice - Awesome that they have brown rice and this also adds to the healthy 

- Fresh - Everything seems so fresh.  We Had:

- Honey Seared Chicken with Brown Rice
- Thai Wonton Sooup
- Thai Dynamite Chicken
- Spicy Korean Chicken

b.  The Really Good - Their drink and condiment section is totally cool. I don't know why I liked this so much, but it is clean, they have a great deal of choices for drinks, some teas, plenty of cut lemon and orange slices, Fortune Cookies, chili sauce and hot chinese mustard!  Oddly, I did not look for, and I don't remember if they have soy sauce, and this would actually get a way from the healthy aspect of the food.

c.  The Ambiance - As I said, upscale atmosphere for extremely casual people. You really feel that you are in a well taken care of and top notch cafe.

d.  The Bad - The only bad I found was that everything was a bit bland.  The Thai Wonton Soup was not very Thai style to me. The taste was a bit off and uninspiring.  The Spicy Korean Chicken had a heavy sauce that created all the taste and the chicken itself did not have any of the flavor. Kind of like dipping chicken in kitchen.  The sauce was the overpowering flavor and that is not great to me at all.

e.  Comeback - I will come back to give this place a second chance. While it is not what I consider really authentic, I will also challenge the healthiness of the food here as even though there is brown rice and some really great looking stuff, it seems that everything is 800-1200 calories and there are so many other better choices for quality food for the same caloric intake. 

GK says, not bad, and as long as you know this is totally just an asian influenced cuisine and not really authentic, then you will be very happy.

I give it a 3 star because of the blandness and the overpowering sauces and under performing soup..."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this location since '06. I absolutely love it. I never stray far from my favorite dish, Kung Pao chicken with brown rice. The service is great. They're spot on with my take-out orders as well as dine-in experiences.  My boyfriend and I, visit this location at least once a week."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this place, the food is fresh and no matter the location, it always tastes the same. I have been a customer for the past 8 years and I'm always happy. Once in a while you'll get the new cook that somehow messes up the dish, but they are always fast to make up for it. Great service and good food served fast. I might add that some dishes are better here than in PF Changs!"}
{"text":"My chicken way dry and overcooked.my teriyaki chicken had no teriyaki sause. I ordered no onions so they gave me no veggies at all. Worst food iv had and the portions were way smaller then other pai ways"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is fast, delicious, and great for groups.  Think about it.  The worst part about dining with a bunch of people is the awkwardness of splitting the check.  Here, you pay right when you order.  Everyone can get their own food and you can sit down and enjoy.  That being said, I don't think I've eaten in Pei Wei in a while.  I usually do take-out because they are pretty fast.  My wife loves the Chicken Pad Thai.  It is the only thing she eats at Pei Wei and I have to admit, it is pretty delicious.  The Lettuce Wraps are great as are the Crab Cheese Wontons.  A friend of mine told me to get the Dan Dan Noodles because it would 'change my life'.  Glad I did!  Last night when I called to order they asked if I just wanted to repeat my order from last time.  Now, I understand they used my phone number and it showed my previous order but I still felt like a regular and I felt good about it."}
{"text":"Best Pei Wei location I've been to. The portion size is massive, seems larger than most locations but yet it the prices are the same as other locations. The food is fresh and hot and extremely tasty, I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Chicken fried rice Yum. Friendly employees. Could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"Place is going down hill fast. Used to be decent. Now after 8mins on hold without answer I drove while on hold and ordered before someone answered. When I arrived one front house employee is chatting with friends and manager is in back chatting and one guy is taking orders and watching phone ring off the hook. 

While ordering they informed me the were out of white rice!?! That's a staple of most dishes unfortunately. Get home only to find what looks like a half portion of teriyaki chicken. 

Pei wei what happened to you?"}
{"text":"This location is very poor. When we got in line there was an elderly couple in front of us. They had a hard time hearing the girl at the counter and she was not happy about it yelling back to them. When we got up to the front she started complaining to us about all of the elderly customers this location gets. My boyfriend ordered orange chicken with white rice and wanted to add an additional side of lettuce cups. She told him that this was not possible, but at every other pei wei it has never been a problem. We finally convinced her to ask another employee and they helped her add the side of lettuce. When our food came everything was good as usual but the lettuce wraps did not come. When my boyfriend went back to the counter to ask they tried to charge him for another side. At this point he just wanted to eat his food and gave up. Will not be back to this location. Sad because Dana park is such a nice little area."}
{"text":"The only Pei Wei my boyfriend will eat at.. This location seems to be the only one that does not try to cheat you on portion size. We used to eat at other locations but recently they always seem to skimp on portions to the point where it is no longer worth the price. This location still has standards and the food is always consistent and tastes good."}
{"text":"This place used to be delicious what happened????
The food wasn't very good. The chicken was tough. The noodles not very good sauce just ok. Place was not crowded."}
{"text":"It's not authentic asian food but it's still pretty damn good.  It gets very busy there during dinner time.  I usually call ahead and pick up my order.  The best thing about that is that they have a system that recognizes your phone number and brings up your last order.  They'll ask if I want what I had my last order and it saves so much time on their part.  
The Pad Thai and Lettuce Wraps are the best.  My wife usually get the Pei Wei spicy w/ chicken and brown rice. 
By far, it's one of the few places in AZ that I can say \"it's my favorite place to go\""}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go here once every other week. Pei Wei, in general, is super tasty! However this location has some faults.

The tables and floors are sprinkled with food most of the time. There are always a handful of tables with dishes, no matter how busy they are. We also never seem to get everything with our order. Sometimes we are missing toppings or sauce

Waitstaff are average young adults with the expected apathetic behavior. We have always had average service."}
{"text":"After waiting on the phone as \"caller number one\" for almost 10 mins, I decided to drive in while still on hold...After getting parked and in line the casket FINALLY picked up my call. I ordered my food only to get home and it was WRONG. Avoid this location at all cost, I can't believe they screwed up my meal after all that."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Pei Wei for 4 years and until last year I would say I was happy with their food and service. I am not sure if management or cooks have changed but their quality of food is below par and their take-out orders have been wrong several times. This time they forgot my sushi and my shrimp was battered instead of steamed...again! I am extremely disappointed as this is the 4th time my take out order was wrong and my sweet n sour shrimp tasted like old oil and vinegar. Unfortunately, management is wishy washy too in dealing with these reoccuring problems. Last time I was told I would recieve a gift card in the mail. Never happened. This time I was comped for my soup..I am taking my food back today after one bite and expect a full refund. I will go elsewhere from now on, as 4 times is no charm."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years and over the past few months customer service has really suffered. You wait forever wait to be seated and there's hardly any seats and it seems like there is no management here.  Too bad because they have such good food."}
{"text":"We had the Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls and they had a great taste to them. Their not spicy at all and the dipping sauces were great also. This appetizer comes with a sweet chili sauce and a Thai Peanut Dipping Sauce."}
{"text":"Damn it Pei Wei, your food's pretty good but out of the 10-ish or so times I've been here, my order has been COMPLETELY right only three times (one of those times I just ordered edamame). What gives??

I don't have crazy orders, I just like to leave certain ingredients out (sugar snap peas, string beans, onions, scallions, ginger, & cilantro) but one or more of those things inevitably makes it into my stir-fry. Most of the people who take the orders do a great job of reading everything back, so it has to be the cooks who aren't reading the order carefully enough which I guess isn't a HUGE deal, but very annoying. If you have food allergies I would probably avoid this place since the cooks may overlook whatever modifications you make to the menu.

Also, one time some old, stupid bitch took my order. I'm not sure if she still works there anymore, it was a couple of years ago, but while I was telling her my order she kept interrupting me, rather rudely, every time I told her to leave something out. I understand that the Thai Dynamite or Honey Seared or whatever I ordered that day does not normally come with snap peas & string beans, but since I am ordering it with tofu & VEGGIES, they automatically add that shit in & I do not want them.. not sure why she couldn't comprehend that & why she was so rude & kept interrupting me. I was pretty pissed & wanted to eat somewhere else, but decided to stay because the BF really wanted to try the Caramel Chicken.

A couple of highlights are the chili garlic sauce they serve and if you order your meal with tofu and veggies, you don't get boring regular tofu that's usually mushy. I don't know the name of this preparation (pressed tofu maybe?) but they serve you the delicious, meatier firm bean curds with the brown edges* which I LOVE & why this two-star place gets an extra star from me!



*Just looked it up. This tofu preparation is called five spices tofu.. So so so good!! Pei Wei, I wish I could say the same about you, though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat for lunch. Arrived at 11:10 places my order after 30 minutes and no food I left.  What a joke.  Won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE Pei-Wei.

I've lived in Vegas for 4 years and just recently found myself at Pei-Wei and I am seriously upset that I've been missing out all this time.  

Since moving here, my husband and I have struggled to find decent Chinese food and while this isn't exactly what we are looking for, it is delicious. As is PF Chang's for dinner (I know it is the same company).

The only thing that I haven't liked that I've tried is the wonton soup. It's too minty. I prefer the wonton at PF Chang's.

So far I've had the Caramel Chicken and the teriayki chicken. Both excellent choices."}
{"text":"Um. . .No.  

Honestly, I'm in a major snit about this place.  I expected something a LOT better than what we found here.  Things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  Didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:  

First off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  The first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  This time, they used round noodles.  Were they Chinese chow mein noodles?  No, they were vermicelli.  Yes, I'm being a bit picky there, but I'm just getting started.  My wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  The problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  There was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  I called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  My wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  He took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  When he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles ONLY.  Uh, what the f*ck?  Why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  Why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?  

Major issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  My wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.

My food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  I had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  There was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the \"from your grocer's freezer\" variety.  The rice was chalky and undercooked, and I also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.

Our spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  I liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  This is what made this review two stars instead of one.  But, would I recommend Pei Wei to anyone?  No wei.  If you want a REAL Asian diner, go to Tott's Asian Diner at Ray and McClintock.  Now THAT'S fresh food, and a world of difference over Pei Wei.  Even Panda Express is better than this place."}
{"text":"The food was alright but not sure they could make the portion sizes any smaller. I tried the new hand rolled sushi... They must have a 4 year old rolling it. Smallest roll I've ever seen in my life."}
{"text":"Just tried calling to place a phone-in order, and the phone just rang and rang. No one picked up. So we hung up and tried again. Same! Then we came online to yelp, and saw a lot of the same complaints. So, we are skipping Pei Wei and dining somewhere else tonight!"}
{"text":"Always good food, and usually great staff! That's why I frequently visit these establishments."}
{"text":"Overall, great place for heathier options. Ordered the Korean Spicy sauce with chicken in the regular size which came with choice of white or brown rice. I think there may be some other options besides rice. I chose brown rice. My husband had the honey seared shrimp with white rice. If you like spicy, the Korean sauce is the way to go. It is pretty spicy without killing your taste buds. There was some veggies in the dish but wish there was more. My husband has had the honey seared shrimp before and noted it was delicious but thought it had some kick to it before that it didn't have this time around. The unsweetened tea there was on point and my new favorite unsweetened tea."}
{"text":"Went in at 6:20 as per online order time and like always expected and additional 5 minutes until my food was ready. So after order was confirmed told I'd be notified when food was ready. 10 minutes pass and 6 people after all got there food, after a few more minutes I noticed a meal like mine being packed but wasn't notified. So another 15 minutes and 10 more customers I had to get up and ask. Big surprise the meal I ordered was the one I though and had been sitting on the counter for nearly 20 minutes. Not even an apology. When got home boxes were crushed. Guess I'll have to find a different pei wei to go."}
{"text":"I can only give it 4 stars since it's a chain restaurant.  Owned by the same folks as PF Chang's the food is awesome and cheap. 

Love the Mongolian Beef. Will have to say goodbye to it once I go veggie.....at least they also have great veggie plates...."}
{"text":"We have been eating at this Pei Wei since it opened in Arrowhead. It has always been a good option for my husband and me when we don't feel like cooking. Over the last year or so, we have noticed that the restaurant has been going down hill. Tonight the restaurant has reached new lows. The floors, seats and tables were all sticky. We tried multiple places to sit, but the seats all had food on them. Some a lot of food on them others just a grain or 2 of rice. Either way they were dirty. The floors were disgusting, food everywhere, even when you entered the door, food on the floor. This is not the first time we have seen it like this, but we chalked it up to the fact we tend to eat on the later side and understand to a point, when there is a rush it's hard to keep up with cleaning. But tonight we ate early and it was pigsty! Families who were moving tables together for more seating, saw food under those tables and who knows how long that food had been there. We used to have a great manager at this location, who oversaw the entire operation. Wake up management and corporate this site is disgusting!"}
{"text":"The Manager was very nice. I placed a phone order and came in and had to wait a few minutes. She came up to everyone waiting and offered us drinks and gave us a coupon for a free order of lettuce wraps for our next visit. The wait was not long at all but I definitely appreciate the gesture. You don't see too many managers going the extra mile for their customer! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is not good at all!!! Way overpriced!! Panda Express tastes better than this place. Save your money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Its the fast food version of PF Changs"}
{"text":"Got exactly what I wanted. Tasty and quick. The online ordering option is easy. No.long waits when. I pick up. Food is consistent"}
{"text":"Food is usually good, but don't think it's authentic Asian food.  Some of the flavors could be different to add more of a zest and also wish they would spice up the food more also.  Everything seems to be fried and then some sort of sauce added."}
{"text":"Ordered online @6:15 pm ish...said order would be ready @ 6:40 pm. Arrived and paid for it at 6:45 pm. Wasn't ready so I waited. Had to ask at 7:15 pm about order and it had been sitting there for who knows hour long.

Got home...food is dry and luke warm. People their can't handle a rush. Stay away during busy times."}
{"text":"Idk why but seems like the food quality has gone down... Meat is more fatty and they are so busy the last two times I got chicken it seemed under cooked... Maybe it's just this location. Great customer service though"}
{"text":"Great fresh made to order food. Nothing prepared in advance.  Dow side is it is somewhat corporate sterile environment and a little over priced for chinese food eith smallish portions. But it is good."}
{"text":"I ordered a chile ramen with steak and shrimp to go. It was $11 fucking dollars. Get back to work to find out I paid extra for a fucking dish I didn't even fucking want. Thanks for paying attention to your jobs. It's annoying how it's literally the simplest task to give someone the right dish, yet you've managed to fuck it up anyway"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. 

I ordered the Asian chopped chicken salad. First time ordering a salad at Pei Wei.  I was impressed by the size of the salad as well as the nice amount of chicken in it. The greens were fresh and crisp. I loved the crispy wontons on top!  The only thing that I didn't like was the saltiness of the dressing and the fact that the salad was literally swimming in a pool of dressing in the bottom of the bowl. 

Next time I order, I'll be sure to ask for less dressing or see if I can dress it myself. 

Clean restaurant. Friendly and efficient ordering process. 

Second time I've been there in less than a week.  Nom nom!"}
{"text":"Okay, Pei Wei is an okay place to quickly grab a meal that can be modified to be healthy.  This particular Pei Wei is very busy.  Because it's so busy the service for take-out can be spotty.  There are times when I've ordered online for a particular time and when I arrive my food is already cold.  Other times I call on my way home from work and am told there will be a 45 minute wait - just can't count on consistency in that fashion.

The staff are usually pretty friendly and helpful.  If they could get the take out thing figured out, they would get five stars from me."}
{"text":"This is the best Pei Wei establishment by far! Great food with professional staff who are quick to deliver your order whether it is to pick up or dine in. I've always had a great experience eating here! Recommend this place to eat any day, anytime!!!"}
{"text":"At least in the morning (10 AM) the personal fruit salad is fresh, non-soggy, tasty. BLT basil pesto wrap is nicely edible,  will 40% daily fat, for grab-n-go airport fare."}
{"text":"I don't really like Asian food but their staff is great so funny always very nice! Very good customer service! So I don't mind going there to eat lol I leave happy!"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese back up.... It's the same company as PF Changs, so definitely order the lettuce wraps. Kids meals are great and we were excited about the sushi until we ordered it - don't bother unless you think grocery store sushi is top-notch - you'll get ready for a delightful bite and be mistaken by a mouthful of \"OK-at-best\" sushi.... But, you get what you pay for - our lesson learned. The place is really awkward in terms of parking - so avoid in Friday nights land Saturday nights or get it to go! (Awesome option)!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for lunch one day and what took me by surprise was the exceptionally friendly, helpful and quick service they provided.  We ordered the teriyaki chicken and the spicy poke bowl....both were delicious!  They also offer a freestyle drink machine which my son loves.  Management and service set this restuarant apart!!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting option for Asian cuisine. You get lots of different options and the prices are pretty reasonable. I'm a vegetarian so it's interesting to actually have options for me too! Customer service is better than I anticipated since it's technically fast food. I can't provide and fast food place with a perfect 5 stars so it'll get my best fast food score of 4."}
{"text":"This is a convenient and reasonably priced Thai fusion restaurant. No tipping needed. You order at the counter and they bring you the food. I ordered Japanese spicy noodle with beef and shrimp. The shrimp were out of this world. And the spiciness was just right. I also had lettuce wraps with my party. They were so tasty. Highly recommend them. A great go to spot when you are in a hurry, crave Asian good and are on a limited budget."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei. It's one of my favorite restaurants.
However this location is by far the worst. There are lots of teenagers that work here that don't use any manners. One night I came in and the utensils were empty, I asked if I could get a fork. I had to ask again after my food came out. The third time I asked for for work about five minutes after my food came out I was told that utensils were filled at their station even though I was never given a fork when I was told I would be given one. This evening I went in and ordered a meal with one eggroll. The teenage boy behind the counter yelled in my face to someone else to come take my order. When no one else showed up he have to and puffed at the cash register while taking my order. When I asked for one eggroll he asked me how many eggrolls I want it, and I repeated one eggroll please. Then he stood there in snared at me and then gave me attitude for the rest of my order. I truly hope the owner of the store realizes  How his customers are being treated. Hello Alexis, today is April 17th, 2018. Today I went back to the restaurant after you said the employees would be addressed. I was there at approximately 7:30pm. The cashier was better this time, he was much more professional than last time. However again when we went to get silverware there was none. I asked one of the teenagers behind the counter for silverware, he then put about 10 plastic forks and knives in the canisters( fyi there was a line of about 15 people waiting to order). When I went to retrieve some he than told me and another adult customer that there was no clean silverware. While I was waiting for my food to come out I watched a adult male customer clean his table for his family to eat at."}
{"text":"Got the pad Thai to go tonight.. noodles we're dry and flavorless unfortunately. I have had better pad Thai from pei Wei before.. but that was a while ago. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Well I just had to give 5 stars to the server at Pei Wei last nite ...My wife had ordered the Pei Wei Spicy w/ chicken. This wasn't to her liking just because it was whether sweet. So ask the server ( wish I got his name) as to what he recommend based on her taste .So he suggested the Kung Pao...He has this made at no extra charge!!!....With services like that we will defiantly be back....."}
{"text":"Been going to Pei Wei since it opened. Don't know that we'll go back. The last three visits resulted in dry over cooked chicken and shrimp. Lack of any sauce only worsened an already poor meal. Sorry to say this as when it opined it was the best."}
{"text":"I've never been to Pei Wei before, but I've heard from several people that it's like panda, but better. I find that to be true. 

They have an extensive menu of appetizers and entree, and I like that you can pick your choice of meat for it. I picked ginger broccoli with shrimp, with brown rice on the side. 

Definitely like that they are made to order. The food was delicious, but I thought that the sauce, which was drenched on my plate, was a bit too salty for my liking. Perhaps next time I'll get the sauce on the side. 

This particular location was a bit difficult to find! It is inside a big plaza, and I drove around twice before finding it. Maybe I'm just bad with directions."}
{"text":"I know it isn't trendy to like chain restaurants, but I have to say Pei Wei almost always delivers. I love the convenience of ordering online for in-store pickup (like most millenials, I would rather shoot myself in the testicles than pick up the phone and talk to a real person). There is great variety and originality in the menu, and they really let you customize the heck out of your meal. Go eat here. Now."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry and looked and tasted old or reheated. Staff looks at you with contempt and the restaurant was freezing. Also there is a really foul odor outside that smells of sewer and garbage mixed together that made dining outside not an option. It's off putting to walk through that smell to go eat at a restaurant. We've eaten here many times but we'll be looking for another option."}
{"text":"Then we went to dinner at Pei Wei. Not bad for an Asian fusion place. Filled with senior citizens, but that's not all that surprising. I had the Mango Thai Shrimp, apparently, which was good. Right amount of spice in the dish. Not too heavy, either. Steve and Chris had their own plates as well, both of which looked appetizing. Not crazy about the moderate wait nor the fact that strangers came up to the table with unnecessary parenting advice for Steve and Chris."}
{"text":"Went here because I haven't gone to pei Wei since highschool. Went and got the honey seared chicken and a soda. My boyfriend got the lettuce wrap. The honey seared was SUPER bland and soggy. It was also 90% rice. 0 flavor 0 presentation 0 for portions. Way up charging if this is what they're putting out. I'm sure its not the staff foult because they cook under a recipe they follow. The staff was really nice. But I could've go to panda and get twice the portion and it'll he cheaper as well. I also got a small fountain drink because I saw that they have those different flavors coke machine . went to get my drink and all of the sodas was out BUT diet. How do you have a machine like that with 80% of he soda out.... The lettuce wrap was OK. It was watery and didn't have much of the crunchy stuff. I loved pei Wei in high school but clearly their quality has gone down low. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been very frustrated with this location. In the past month NO ONE has answered the phone when I have tried to call for take out. The first time I just went online and ordered which was fine. The last few times I have tried to order and the online system responds with \"having issues try later\" so I call and no one answers. I have tried to order from here on three separate occasions and I just gave up. This location is quickly loosing a weekly customer."}
{"text":"I was a loyal customer for years, and always thought there food was good. However, I was trying to call in an order when they would not answer. I tried once and was on the phone before I realized no one was answering. I tried again and still no answer. I then tried to order online where the process was confusing and extremely frustrating. They lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I had resisted going here many times, but eventually made it the other day & was surprised at how good it was! the combo deals are the best, cheap and way too filling even if u r on empty stomaxh( not sure if it's gotta do anything with the stuff they put in the food, but it's sumptuous,) so an entire plate/entree might b too much! I had spicy pei Wei & it was fab! But try not gettin the tofu here though, it's thin slices & kinda weird, not my style! Havta try chicken & other flavors next time! Fried rice is pretty good"}
{"text":"If you want something fast, this might be the place to go.  

Somewhere between fast food and a buffet . . . except you can't drive through and the servings are small and expensive for what you get.  

Food was OK, nothing to write home about. 

Restaurant was clean.  Still on my list, but way down near the bottom with all the wonderful choices the greater Phoenix area has to offer."}
{"text":"Gluten-Free/Allergy Sensitive

Have small GF menu, but at least you can go.
Never had problem here. Spicy Sweet Sour shrimp is what I order and it is really spicy.
Ask for the GF soy sauce for your table, they don't automatically bring it."}
{"text":"Always consistent and fresh! We have never had a bad meal here and we've been coming here for years! New fresh menu items awesome! Our fab is hot and sour soup and Vietnamese Rolls!"}
{"text":"Everything was good except Thai chicken wraps. Too much cilantro, absolute overkill. I think long stems is just yucky, cut them off!! Korean beef was ok but just missed the flavor I'm used to in this dish. Service is always spot on."}
{"text":"I will never order pickup from here again .  If i wanted cheaper Chinese takeout experience I wouldn't have come here ."}
{"text":"Hate to do this because this is my favorite spot to eat... Ordered my food to go. It was somewhat busy, but not too bad. I knew there would be a wait so I waited patiently for my food. It took 40 min before I went up and asked if my food was ready. The girl who took my order said they called my name 3 times but I didn't hear anything. And mind you, I was sitting near the order desk and in clear sight. Very disappointed in the service today. Would've expected a little more from this place, especially when I go on my lunch break. The food is great, but I'm not so sure about the service anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered two soups and crab wontons.  I waited close to 30 minutes just for soup, but I couldn't get upset because (1) I wasn't the only one waiting and (2) Anthony kept us all informed with the progress of the kitchen...  it turns out that one of the cooks decided to take his birthday off and didn't tell the proper management until last minute.   Because of that, the front staff had to grin and bare all the hostile customers.   

Too Anthony and his fellow employees, you did  dry well.   Bravo to you all....!"}
{"text":"I don't like Pei Wei. They have a snow pea fetish that I don't agree with. You get about 5 pieces of meat and then you are left with dry rice....."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei which is why they got two stars. This location is very dirty. The soda and silverware station is a constant mess and they are obviously wiping it with dirty clothes without the proper sanitation procedures. The tables are sticky and have a film over them from not being wiped correctly. I have been here a half dozen times and it the same every time. Please correct this Pei Wei so I can continue to frequent this location. 


Went again about a month after this initial review and the condition of the restaurant was terrible. Every table was dirty except one. There were only two tables occupied while I was there. One of the cooks was sitting on the counter and the other was eating while he was preparing food. The food runner looked like he was up late the night before and kept throwing his hair back with his hand with out washing his hands once. I was there 30 mins and not one table was wiped and the staff continued having inappropriate conversations the entire time."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is the fast food version of PF Changs. There's a long and interesting story surrounding Pei Wei and that of PF Changs. Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates \"Flows,\" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great prices! Wish there was one closer to where we lived!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Asian restaurant I have ever been to.... I wish I could give a zero.. I ordered a small pei Wei spicy and my boyfriend ordered a large one...I had more food than him... Lol. Anyway, the food was too SWEET and too SOUR."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place?! Once we finally found a table, one of our dishes isn't even made and my husband has to go inquire TWICE about it. The Bangkok chicken noodles he got was bland and disgusting and the chicken tasted funny. They replaced it with spicy chicken but again, just gross. I don't expect my salad to be the world's greatest but good grief give it some flavor!!! The manager did refund one of the dishes which was nice but yeah, we will not be going back. I can find much better places....."}
{"text":"What a cute place! Everyone is so friendly and fast about getting your food. The food is delicious! The sushi is good too!"}
{"text":"always good and great service, even 30 mins before closing :)"}
{"text":"for a quick and tasty chinese \"fast\" meal, come to pei wei (a fast food version of pf changs).

their food is always consistent.  made to order, fresh, and usually tasty.

i've tried a lot on their menu and by far the best is always the mongolian beef (i wouldn't say its your typical mongolian beef - more on the sweeter side) and the lettuce wraps.  actually, i really love the mongolian beef - its the main dish that stands out most to me.  not a huge fan of a lot of the other things like the pad thai, honey seared chicken, thai wonton soup - bleh.

prices are reasonable, but can add up with little add ons like soup and egg rolls.  portions are good with each plate being more than enough for one person in my opinion.

ambience is really nice.  it doesn't feel like a fast food place.  will always go back if we are passing one by and in the mood for some chinese."}
{"text":"Like many others are saying on here, the food is good and consistent, it is a chain, we know what to expect. My issue is with their service, take-out service, and in particular, last night 3/4/2018 around 6:00pm. 

I called in about 5:15pm with a small take-out order, they said it would be 45 minutes, not ideal, but hey, I get it. I showed up at the time they told me 5:55pm, I was then told it would be an additional 15-20, it was an additional 25 minutes. Let me say again, things happen, they were a bit short handed. As the saying goes, \"it is not the crime that gets you in trouble, it is the cover-up\", let me explain. 

They were busy and short handed, got it, but the service and attitude at the restaurant just made everything worse. While waiting for my order, there were numerous customers that were in various states of aggravation over the situation, from the long wait issues to wrong orders and just plain appathey by the staff. There was a girl working who appeared to be trying to expedite orders, while I was waiting for my order she was busy checking her phone and even hanging out with some friends or family that brought her some type of gift card. There was another young lady working the register who felt it necessary to share her thoughts and comments about other customers with her Pei Wei counterparts. If a restaurant is going to have an open kitchen concept with everything exposed to the public, you better be a bit more disciplined than Pei Wei showed last night. 

Pei Wei should consider themselves fortunate that there is not another Chinese food restaurant close to them, or they would be relegated to the scrap heap of other poorly executed strip mall eateries."}
{"text":"Won't go here ever again! Ordered beef chow mein..dry and meat was over cooked. Teriyaki chicken maybe had 4 pieces of chicken. Not worth money paid. Rather have Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Always perfect for that mot too big meal and the prices are on point ..Watching the cooks do their thing is always a highlight for me .."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a chain Chinese restaurant that's pretty standard! Im giving it a 3 star because the food is nothing special but I think it's a great concept if you want a fast take out restaurant!"}
{"text":"Some of you will look at this review and wonder has she lost her mind giving 5 stars to a fast food faux asian restaurant?  No, I'm perfectly sane as I write this.  I have been to Pei Wei many times over the last year.  Is it authentic?  No.  Is it tasty?  Yes. Is it easy on the wallet?  Yes. Are there healthy options?  Yes. Does my daughter like it?  Yes! I have enjoyed many different dishes here.  Rice bowls, noodle bowls, kung pao, pad thai and everything has been good and I was satisfied. I have always had good service at this location too.  The staff is friendly and accomadating, even on a super busy night. I love that you can get brown rice too.  My daughter and I can eat here for under $20.  That's pretty good for a decent meal.  All these things combined make me want to give Pei Wei 5 stars.  But more than that, my daughter loves their Lo Mein and she will eat every last bite almost every time!  I know what I'm getting when I walk in and I know it will be good.  Authentic or not, I still love Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"I know, don't hate.....but I needed to find something inexpensive for dinner and asian sounded good.  My roomie said she liked this place so I thought I would give it a try.  I consider myself a connesour of good food. I love fancy restaurants with beautiful presentation.  But when you're short on funds you make do.  I have to say that I was not expecting much from Pei Wie.  Maybe that's not fair.  

I walked in and was greeted warmly.  Since this was my first time the girl explained how to order.  I got the orange peel chicken and brown rice and an order of spring rolls.  I know this is not authentic asian food. But I will say this, it was hot and fresh and it was good.  The spring rolls were nice and crispy on the outside and cruncy on the inside.  The dipping sauce was good too.  My orange peel chicken had a little kick to it.  The veggies were cooked just right and the chicken was moist and tender.  And their ice tea was delish!  It went well with the meal.  Our server was attentive and brought us silverware and cleared everything when we were done.  The place was clean.  Even the area where the drink dispensers are was clean and sometimes that is an area that is just hard to keep clean.  

I will go back to this Pei Wie and I will try others.  I think places like this can be hit or miss and that's why they get a bad rap.  But there is a niche for everything and this is one of those niche type places.  I liked it.  So sue me.  I also did not realize that Pei Wie is part of the P.F. Chang's francise.  I like P.F. Chang's too.  There I said it!  So, like Heather C. said......de-Elite me for eating at a place like this that's owed by a francise like that."}
{"text":"Not a stellar day for Pei Wei.  Order was placed and was to be ready in 25 minutes.  It was not ready on time though it was a not busy time of day.  While waiting the extra 15 minutes, one of the chefs opened two already made meals and with bare hands pulled items out of the meals (looked like carrots that did not belong in one and cilantro in another).  A line chef making meals stuck bare fingers in a ladle of sauce, tasted it and stuck the fingers he just had in his mouth back in the ladle again before pouring the contents in the wok and the ladle back in a large bin of sauce, cross contaminating two areas. Our order landed up not being right once we opened it at home.  Order was with no tofu and tofu was all throughout the dish.  Extra sauce was requested and it was not the right sauce.  This is the fourth trip in a row that our order has not been right... time for some food safety, order accuracy and customer service retraining."}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetable quinoa bowl online and brought it home to find a big chunk of chicken in it. They obviously put no care into making sure that you get what you ordered. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"been here in a longggggggggggggggggg time!
This is a nice place to go eat, if you want to eat out and not spend a lot of money.  A lot of there dishes are between $6.95 to $9.95  I think all of them have some veggies in them, so your meat, rice or chow mein and your meat.  I I'm trying to watch my waisteline, so I only ate 1/3 of mine, and I also got some edemame.'pretty quiet here, no music playing, not a lot of people, so it was very nice.  I would recommend this Pei Wei.  It's better than fast food."}
{"text":"This place is trendy, quick and really good. It reminded me of a sort of Chipotle for Asian food, fresh ingredients, and friendly staff. I ordered the Mango Sushi and Veggie Rolls and loved the sauce they came with. 
My partner ordered the General Tsos and loved it. 

You can grab a set of chopsticks by the drinks station and I loved the vanilla chai ice tea (available by the soft drinks)!"}
{"text":"Consistency is the key here.  I've had fabulous dishes here and the next time, not so much.  To be fair, the last time I was there , the manager noticed I didn't eat very much and asked me why & when I  told her it just wasn't very good, she was very apologetic, immediately refunded me and offered me a free dish of anything on the menu.  I know its not \"Authentic\" but read the health inspection reports of most of the 'Authentic' Chinese places, I pass on most of them.  This is the same food as PF Changs, just a lot cheaper and smaller selection."}
{"text":"I find it strange that I never wrote a review for Pei Wei before. I had gone several times when I was in the area. Pei Wei is an intriguing place to me as it falls (as many have stated in other reviews) kind of in between Panda Express and PF Changs. I feel that the concept is there, however the execution could be better. They seem to be doing well though as they were pretty packed today (Sunday) for a late lunch.
The negative for me is portion size relative to price, especially for their dinner selects specials. We both ordered the specials which include a half portion of an entree and a side item. I chose the Honey Seared Chicken with white rice and my side was Won-Ton Soup. The soup was flavorful but was barely cup size and the entree was pretty good but left me plenty hungry. Worst part was they didn't include a drink so my $6.25 cent meal turned into an $8 meal that left me wanting more.
So, why the 4 stars?? Well, for one I appreciate the concept of this chain and I think they actually make some decent dishes. Seeing as how they are partnered up with PF Changs it makes sense. I wouldn't go as far as to say they are the poor-man's PF Changs, but they might be the middle-class man's PF Changs. The staff was friendly and our order came out right. 
In a perfect Yelp world, I would probably give them about 3.75 stars... but I'll bump them up to a 4 because I had a good day :)"}
{"text":"I come here once a week with my husband usually dining in, unless we feel like take out. And the front service is just wonderful. There's a cheery light haired girl who usually waits on us. Always making sure to bring me extra dressing for my Asian chopped salad, even when I forget to tell them at the register. I had forgotten her name, but I see her almost every time I go in, so I'll ask her to write it down for me. But I have noticed Togo orders in the evening do take a little longer. But that isn't the cashiers fault, so I usually go to Walgreens for a little bit to waste some time there. My husband loves the Mongolian beef with the white rice. He likes it with the chili paste.  spicy. The girl was named Ashley, always a pleasure to see her."}
{"text":"What would be really great is that when you tell them you are a vegetarian or a vegan and you order something that happens to have animal products in it (chicken broth) that they would tell you this information.
Got sick. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"The Pei Wei at the Summit is the absolute worst.  I ordered by phone and after I provided my order, the phone just went silent; no acknowledgement, no total, just dead air and then the line went dead.  The experience in the restaurant was no better.  Waiting in the much too small take out area, I was ignored for at least 5 minutes and when I finally paid, was told it would be an additional 20 minutes.  I decided to wait, but instantly regretted it seeing the line of people waiting for their food.  The 20 minute wait turned into a 50 minute wait with no food in sight.  The orders given priority weren't mine and I gave up and asked for a refund.  No apology, no nothing.  Just a receipt for the refund and that was it.  It should be said that I wasn't the only one that was disappointed by their experience.  There were multiple refunds and walk outs.  Absolutely horrible experience and won't be back.  Too many other options available that actually want business and employees who treat customers with respect.  Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"This location is a wreck, every single table on the patio was filthy, 12 tables indoors filthy, no tea, no silverware...food just not as good as it use to be....saw one guy so discussed he was filming the mess"}
{"text":"This is good Americanized Chinese food.  The portions are huge and meant for sharing.  The wait times are long on the weekend, but you can order online.  If you do eat in, don't miss the customizable coke machine with the touch screen interface.  This is a great fast casual restaurant."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a faster, less expensive version of PF Changs, this is it.  It's from the same owners, but this restaurant is of the order at the counter variety.

I wouldn't say anything in particular has been amazing, but it's definitely a good option for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Ordered through DoorDash last night, three eight piece rolls.  All the rice was dry and falling off the rolls and was chewy.  Tuna tasted old and dry, ended up throwing it out and going to McDonald's. Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! 

However I am not sure if it's because we are starving or not. Waited 45 minutes for take out. Staff seemed a bit stressed out. I feel bad for them. Maybe more staff and better training? 6 people requested refunds in the 45 minutes we waited for our food. I was headed up to ask for our refund when they told us it was finally done."}
{"text":"Pei wei is a go to for me and my husband. Sign up for their emails and rewards program and get great deals! Amazing lettuce wraps and Noodle bowls! Also their sesame chicken and Thai basil chicken are amazing. They have messed up on our orders before but where quick to fix it so thank you!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE PEI WEI
NO MORE to their positive they catered my business's X Mass party and it was great.
But on an individual dinner basis I have been disappointed. Also they are running a gift card special and have the signs almost hidden. I spent $170 for the office party wouldn't it have been nice for someone to point them out. Why have the offer and not promote it.????"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Pei Wei, but I was not impressed by their organizational skills when it came to the dinner rush. I placed an order for pick up and showed up at my pick up time to get my food and I had to stand up in a crowded area for 45 extra minutes waiting for my one small item to be ready. They were giving everyone else $10 gift cards for the inconvenience and put the cards in each of their carry out bags, but they neglected to give me one after I patiently waited for 45 minutes. I also watched them give the wrong person a huge order and that person had to come back and switch it out with the original person it belonged to. They also charge extra for a side of teriyaki sauce and they don't tell you until after you look at your receipt. Great food, but don't recommend going around 5-7pm on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Tasty! The pictures on yelp do no justice! Their menu has healthy options. Also, the flavors are there. Service is quick and easy. Just order your food at the counter and they bring your food out! They also have beer and wine if your looking for that with your food. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location many times before with no issues, but last night was probably the last time I will eat there. My chicken was fatty, and soft and soggy. Not crispy or delicious at all like it has been in the past. Pretty disappointed because I love Pei Wei, but as that store gets more business I have noticed the quality is going down hill. Not impressed"}
{"text":"This location is visually seductive.

Their version of the vegetable spring rolls, hot & sour soup. Mandarin kung pao and fried Rice are successes, no question about it.

The Vegi rolls are bright, aromatic, spicy, sweet. An impressive cold appetizer.  

The hot & sour authentic soup is essentially an ancient doctor's curative healing magic combined with taste.

Mandarin kung pao a super familiar dish that delivers if you eat the peppers. And the fried rice, a basic godsend.

My expectations are met."}
{"text":"I still cant believe this group of restaurants just sold for 1.1billion dollars. The house and menu has changed. It is a market now. Personally the face lift wasn't necessary but does look good. 

I like ordering and paying online. Then I go in, grab a handful of fortune cookies and read how my month will be going. 

The latest signature dishes I brought home.

Thai Basil  $8. 
Pesto sauce, ginger, garlic, red bell peppers, green scallions, Thai basil leaves, cashews and a garnish of crispy lotus roots, green scallions and cilantro tossed in lime vinaigrette. 

Pei Wei Spicy $8 
Sweet meets spicy in this version of General Chu's. Our chile vinegar sauce tantalizes all the senses when tossed with wok seared snap peas, carrots, garlic and scallions.

Twenty dollars feeds 4 people well."}
{"text":"Excellent food.   Had honey seared chicken with fried rice.  Always good food everytime."}
{"text":"First timer over at the pei Wei. Wasn't exactly an Hyd straunt. Service was pretty Hyd  but the food kinda stunk. Was on par with low expectations but that orange shrimp Joint I ordered wasn't a Howzit move doe. Either way we thought of aprons and vape pens for charity which was a chill idea. 2 stars doe for the pei way diner."}
{"text":"We love the food here, but the take out system is not great. We have found this out a couple of different times. Today I placed an order, was told it would be ready 10 minutes later, and it wasn't ready until 20 minutes after the time given. So you may want to call in at least 30 minutes ahead. Also, my husband said he doesn't think the order was even put in until he got there, and the restaurant was basically empty, because this was around 3:30pm. I tried to call and speak with a manager, was told to hold, and placed on hold with very loud music for so long that I finally hung up. Like I said, great food, but not so great customer service. The good thing is that I had a buy one entree get one free."}
{"text":"My department ordered food for everyone today and the experience was less than stellar.

Although we had pre-ordered earlier in the morning, when we went to pick it up a couple of hours later we still waited an additional 30 minutes.

After we got to work and distributed everyone's orders, we were missing a couple of items.  I guess luckily they were small, cheap items.  But still, it was paid for and we didn't receive it.

None of the containers were marked as which dish it was so when it came down to distributing the honey seared chicken and the dynamite chicken, it was incredibly confusing.  The two looked EXACTLY alike and it had to be opened and tasted before it could go to the right people.

Everyone was pleased with their food and it certainly made our work day better.  Based on the overall experience, I would not order here again."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of cuisine cooked with a lot of sugar and soy sauce, but every once in a while I crave for Asian food.

And now that I've said that, I'll have you know I did bag a brownie at checkout. SMH

Pei Wei's menu is quite limited and it mostly caters to gringos so I was happy to take-out some noodles and fried spring rolls. Since they don't advertise vegetarian, I requested vegetable only and also asked for all sauces on the side.

When I got home, I pimped by noodles with some extra veggies, peppers, and my own peanut sauce. https://youtu.be/a2ahcj6DMSU

You should have been there."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the chicken salad rolls. This place is clean, the staff is attentive and I got my food fairly quickly. I'm a big fan of Pei Wei and this locations meets my expectations."}
{"text":"Horrible! The Thai Dynamite with Chicken was way to sour, tasted like the kitchen went overboard with lime juice. The rice was mushy had a funky texture. My daughter got the Chicken Fried Rice and she said it was flavorless and the chicken was chewy. We used to eat here all the time 3 years ago, boy have things changed. Not a good experience. We should have known when we sat down and a lady next to us got up and left leaving 3/4 of the food on her plate. We thought she was getting a soda refill until she walked out after getting more soda. Yikes!! The bathroom cleanliness was terrible it looked like a tornado had just gone through it. There's only 8 tables seated so I'm wondering why it hasn't been checked since noon lunch rush (I'm guessing). We won't be back. Off to McDonalds!!!"}
{"text":"I just stopped in for a quick bite, service was fast and friendly. There was an elderly couple who couldn't decide what to order, and the young gal helping them was patient and kind. Then I noticed another employee rush over to help them get their drinks. Heartwarming to witness great, caring service. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend first took me to this place very recently. And I fell love with atmosphere & the food. It was a actually really good. This is my first time here & and I'm very picky about where I want to eat my Chinese food. But I was happy when I received my food & and it tastes delicious. It's not pricey at all. Regular dish will probably cost you around $10. A must try is a teriyaki bowl from this place."}
{"text":"Ok the food is always good here, but this location gets two stars!  We had complained to corporate about them not updating their menu prices and specials.  If your digital menu says it's $5 then you should sell it for $5!!!  But the rude manager says \"that's not on special anymore and menu hasn't been updated\".  Also proceeds to argue with me!  How is that my problem?!  To top it off I do your stupid survey for a free cookie and I'm told you're out of cookies. This location sucks....they're slow, understaffed, don't know the meaning of customer service and the dining room is always dirty. Pei Wei, get your shit together!!  2 stars only because the food is always pretty good."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend have been to this location twice now, the last time we had a request for her's to have no onion, but it did, not a huge deal. This time however when we came back I asked for Rice Noodles in mine, it came with Chow Mein which I could not eat because of the egg in it so I asked if they could re-make it. When I received my plate back, they had taken the veggies and tofu from the other plate, and slid it over on to the new batch of rice noodles. When I received it the veggies and tofu were cold, and the sauce was very thick as if it hadn't been cooked all the way. The noodles were hot but they had a very funny taste like they were cooked in chicken or reused water or something? Unfortunately the taste was so overwhelming I lost my appetite immediately and asked for a refund. I like Pei Wei and I'm no stranger to it but this experience made me re-think spending $10 on noodles and veggies. The 2 stars are for the friendly staff who didn't hesitate or give an attitude on the refund."}
{"text":"**I'm assuming this is the Dana Park location on Val Vista. If not ignore this review**

I ordered a Teriyaki Bowl with Rice noodles and Tofu/Veggies, regular size, $12! 

When I get the food I start to eat the veggies and when I get to the noodles they were cold and rock hard. As if they were undercooked and just sitting there waiting to be thrown in to someone's dish.

I tell who I assume to be the manager on site based off her outfit, she had them remake it but offered no discount or compensation seeing as how I was on my lunch break I didn't have time to wait another 15 min. In her defense I did not voice this to her but you would think some sort of a discount would have been offered at this point. 

I get the next batch and this time the noodles are way over cooked but I'm so hungry at this point I'm just going to eat it.

When the scolding hot noodles finally cooled down I start to notice MULTIPLE fragments of orange chicken through out my bowl, being vegan this could cause me to get sick.

At this point I threw in the towel and stopped eating to get back to work. Frustrated.

This place used to be my FAVORITE place to eat I even put it on my Yelp profile under \"things I discovered\". And now it's just gone completely downhill. 

Lack of quality AND quantity!

They keep pushing this whole \"lighter fit menu\" but what they are really saying is \"give us more money for less food\"

Once they got rid of the \"Spicy Korean\" I knew it was the beginning of the end. I have given it too many chances.. OVER PRICED chances at that. I will not be returning to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed. My daughter and I have been craving Pei Wei for awhile. I usually order through Uber eats or door dash. Unfortunately delivery was unavailable. I work 12 hour days so I figured this trip would be worth it. I spent almost $40 for two appetizers and one entree. I go home with my order tired and hungry. My favorite of all time are the lettuce wraps. They gave me soggy recently frozen and thawed lettuce. It's disgusting. I can't even eat it. They're dripping wet from being frozen and I can't even grip my lettuce wrap. My daughter loves edamame and for some reason especially from Pei Wei. We purchased a large. What a joke!! She got a big box with may 10 edamame beans. Of course by the time I get home, they're closed. My trusting self said no I don't need a receipt. So what's the point in calling to complain. Pointless!"}
{"text":"First time going to Pei Wei, placed an order an hour ahead of time online for take-out. When I got there I had to wait an additional 20 minutes. I was sitting there and none of the servers gave me an update on the order or told me it was going to be a while. So I sat and waited patiently. Call me a stickler for customer service, but when my order came out they didn't say a word or even a \"thank you for waiting.\" I took my order and left. The food was great, but the take-out service experience was slow and terrible. There are other restaurants where I would rather take my business."}
{"text":"The honey seared chicken is particularly tasty and a favorite."}
{"text":"Judging by it's existing 2 star rating, I can't be the only one with a bad experience.

Picking up lunch for my wife because we had errands to run during her lunch. Ordered her ONE single order of lettuce wraps, that's it. I placed the order at 11:20 because I know around 12 they get insanely busy. The girl told me it would be ready at 11:40. I showed up at 11:40, paid, then began the incredible wait. I watched 10 other orders come in and be processed. One of the orders was a guy who came in, placed his order at the store, got his food before me. A few others waited briefly and the take out girl offered the waiting customers beverages, lucky me, I had already purchased a drink. Mind you, this was for ONE order of lettuce wraps. One. Finally at 12:00 I walked up to her and asked her what was going on. Shockingly my order was nowhere to be found. They asked me what I ordered, I told them. She finally gave me my single order of lettuce wraps at 12:10. Missed our appointments and barely had time to eat. 

A few ladies walked in and told me that this happens all the time. So either PeiWei just doesn't care or they are incompetent to an absurd level. 

Also, the take out girls offered me nothing in return for their poor service which you could tell they knew they were giving. No refund, nothing. So bad"}
{"text":"Have eaten at Pei Wei many times.  The last couple of 
times were terrible.   We waited 40 minutes for our food.
My other companions received their food ten minutes before I received mine.
I requested spicy.   The food was bland, uninteresting, and the shrimp
was under cooked.   The last time I ordered shrimp it was also under cooked.   Will never return."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is always consistent with their food and service, which is great, by the way. Whenever, I'm in the mood for some quick-serve Asian food, I head to my neighborhood Pei Wei and never regret it!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour menu is fantastic. From 4-6 half priced apps! ( bar area ) 

Buffalo Blasts are filling and delicious, definitely recommend them! 

On a none weekend day the wait staff in the bar are just okay. I informed her I was on lunch and to bring the check with the food but still had to wait. I ate and wasn't checked on until I needed to ask for someone.

Overall happy hour is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I have not ordered from Pei Wei in probably a year, but I won't be going back. Last night I called in a to go order that had included two orders of lettuce wraps and some other things. When I got home (4 miles round trip) both orders of lettuce wraps had no lettuce!  I called and talked to the same guy who took my order (Andrew) and he put me on hold for the manager.  Ten minutes later I got tired of waiting and hung up. Later after we ate some of our other food I drove back and spoke with the manager who offered to give me a refund on the lettuce wraps. I reminded him I had driven 7 miles so far and that was the best he could do after the meal was already messed up. He begrudgingly gave me a full refund. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Really awesome servers. They're really polite and such. This is usually what customers are lookin for especially on airports and for customers that is on rush."}
{"text":"I'm over Pei Wei.  The food is consistently mediocre and the service is lackluster to say the least.  This particular location has always had issues for me.  Today when we arrived the young woman behind the counter chewed on her nails as she took our order.  The other young lady behind the counter taking orders was totally rude to the group ordering after us.  I won't be back to this or any Pei Wei... GRRRROSS!"}
{"text":"The customer service has always been good but I have a concern with the 'quantity or proportions when it comes to the food.  Ordered a regular size plate of honey seared chicken along with a kids meal and when it was brought to our table, I wondered who's was who's... Same reoccurring issue, a plate (or a bowl when it comes to the kids meal) full of rice with very little protein. Disappointing as we really did like chain. Lettuce wraps didn't really have a good flavor either."}
{"text":"First time here. Greeted promptly. Menu can be confusing. Clean comfortable surroundings. Contemporary decor instead of the phony Asian motif. Soft jazz music. 

The staff members were all very nice. 

I ordered the chicken lo mein with pot stickers and veggie spring rolls. 

The chicken was tender and nicely seasoned. Fresh cooked to order. Hot and fresh. Soft delicate noodles, enhanced with mushrooms, carrot and green onion. Tasty sauce that was sweet and ginger-like. 

Delicious side dishes. The pot stickers are deep fried and not the ordinary pan fry. Crispy spring rolls filled with not too crunchy veggies. Both sides served with dipping sauce. 

Jars of hot chili sauce are provided if you like a spicy bite. 

Serving size of the main dish was plenty. They also have a smaller portion size available. 

Unlike Panda Express, which is more cafeteria style, here you are served at your table with real plates and flat ware. 


Regular bowl of lo mein $8.69, 2 spring rolls $3.79, 2 pot stickers $1.99. 

Thank God no nasty dry fortune cookies forced on me. What a relief!"}
{"text":"Consistently good, quality food at an affordable price.  Easy to order and especially take out.  Great for kids and they alway offer coupons or discounts, what a way to treat loyal customers.  It's packed all the time so I know I'm not a lone fan.  I wish they had egg drop soup though..."}
{"text":"Okay.  Quasi-Asian. PF Chang-lite.

Two soda machines with dozens of options holds things up and causes lines."}
{"text":"Food was good, came out warm and tasty. But after ordering, my grandparents and I went to find a place to sit and there were 3 empty tables with plates still on them, that hadn't been wiped down or picked up and no one was in a hurry to do so. The drink area was disgusting and looked like it hadn't been cleaned for days. The soda machines were covered in soda. Just a simple wipe down that'd take 10 minutes or less would have solved the issue. We had to ask them to refill the silverware. The employees were very nice but disorganized. I hope y'all look at this review and take notes to improve on because I'm new to town and I love Pei Wei and my family owns a business up the road from this location so I'd like to come here for lunch occasionally. You have 2 weeks, I'll be back for a visit and if things improve I'll write a fabulous review!"}
{"text":"What exactly they put in their food that makes me love this place so much, I will never understand. It's simple, it's quick, it's yummy, and it's the same at every one of their locations. The people are nice, the place is clean and they have lots of locations. The portions are not giant, but more than you need at one meal. Prices are reasonable and everything is fresh."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Pei Wei in a couple years and it sounded good. We came during the lunch rush and it was crazy!

After 20 minutes in line we were able to order our food. The woman behind the counter could hardly hear us. I felt like I was screaming my order at her. After placing our order we found a place to sit down. With how busy it was the tables were being cleared very fast which was nice.

The food took quite awhile to come out and after standing in line for so long I was about to eat the silverware and napkins sitting in front of me. 

If you want to have a conversation during your meal I suggest you bring an old fashioned ear trumpet horn so your companion can shout into one end and you can listen on the other end. It was LOUD in there. 

I ordered the Mongolian Steak with brown rice. I really liked the brown rice. The meat was a little chewy and heavy on the sauce. 

Overall I would like to try more items off their menu, however I think I will call ahead and pick up."}
{"text":"Note to self: never come here during lunch or busy times. 

Usually in AZ, we don't run into parking issues. This parking lot is so small and every spot is taken. I know this isn't Pei Wei's fault necessarily, but maybe they need to add some \"to go/pick up only\" parking. 

I came in around 1pm and there were so many of us waiting by the Pick Up door. Usually people order ahead and pick it up so it's faster. Not with this location. A bunch of us were waiting there for someone to talk to us, but they looked understaffed at the Pick Up station. I heard a bunch of ppl in line had been waiting forever - some had put in their orders an hour ago and some had arrived at the store but the store hadn't received their order yet so they couldn't pay. 

It was chaos. I would not recommend going to this location. Might be better off driving elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love all the options this place offers. It is Asian as in you can get Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese food. I bet I am leaving some country out, but you get the picture. The service is good. I think the atmosphere is fun and different. It is an up scale fast food. The price is good for the quality and portions. I got a coupon to try the Thai basil chicken for FREE and thought it was great. I would order this again and I think it may have been better than the ones I have had at an actual Thai restaurant. The machine for their drinks is really cool because it is touch screen, nice!"}
{"text":"I think for what they offer, the food is at a perfect price. I can easily eat here with a drink, for less than $10.

Some people may not like the fact that you have to fill up your own drinks and also get your own eating utensils. But the way I see it, that's a couple more dollars I save on a tip.

And that's the theme you'll notice when eating here, is their mission is to give you the best looking, high quality good at an affordable price. Keep doing what your doing Pei Wei!

Also, they just added sushi to their menu. I got 4 pieces the other week, and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"This was the most frustrating experience I have ever had at Pei Wei, and probably at any quick-serve restaurant. Let me just start that I order online from this specific location quite frequently and have never had any real issues. Until today.

I go to place my order online around 11 AM for pickup at noon. Double-check all my details, blah blah blah, place order - and suddenly pickup time is for 11:15. Uhhhh, no. So I call the location and their phone rang for FIFTEEN MINUTES STRAIGHT. So okay, I'm getting cold food. 

I get to the store, and half of the ordering screens are down so there's a wait just to pick up my food. When I notify the lady helping me of the issues I had both with the online system and the phones, she comes up with some excuse for the phone, but does so with an attitude (even though I was not having one towards her) and doesn't even offer an apology with what I'm telling her. 

My initial problems were in zero way her fault, but as a customer service representative at the front of the restaurant, it's her job to offer some sort of fake little apology to the customers just to make them feel like they are heard. I was irritated when I arrived at the restaurant because of the initial issues I had, but I left cold food and upset because of the way this employee chose to deal (or not deal?) with the situation."}
{"text":"I know it's greasy. I also know that whenever I eat it, I get a feeling in my stomach like I swallowed a rock. Chinese food is supposed to be greasy, but there's often something a little off about Pei Wei. 

So why the 3 stars? Because they have the most incredible, firm, flavorful tofu ever. It's not a nice dark skin around it and it takes on the flavor of their oh-so-sodium-filled sauces without becoming a soggy mess. It really is tofu perfection. 

I also appreciate their awesome to-go options (order online or on your mobile browser) and the fact that they notate on their menu (with a leaf) which options are vegetarian. 

This place isn't the best Chinese ever, but I think it's decent if you're looking for something fast and very vegetarian-friendly."}
{"text":"1st time at this location. Evening of Sunday 4/17. Hadn't been to any Pei Wei in years. Figured lets try something different.

2 soda machines. 1 doesn't work. Not a huge deal but the 2nd machine had no ice. I had to wait in line while an employee had to fetch ice from the back. They did this one customer at a time. I have an idea, bring a tub of ice up front. You can't control  machine failure, you can control your failure to resolve. 

Place was dirty. I mean nasty. I don't think the floor had been mopped in a couple of days. Tables weren't being cleaned as people left. We found the least dirty table.

Food was bland. If you order teriyaki it should have more than a light drizzle. we found ourselves hunting for sauce on our plates. Had to order extra. The extra was not enough to fill a shot glass. Lo mien was literally ramen with no sauce or oil in it. 

All vegetables were undercooked. All meat was somehow burnt. That means everything was very hard. 

In all fairness, I didn't give the staff any notification about the food. Honestly there were too many issues and I didn't want to be a complete jerk and tell them everything just sucks. I have to assume they wouldn't care either way; judging by how they handled the ice shortage and general cleanliness of the store.  

Judging by the reviews, this place has had a recent slide. I ponder if there have been any changes in leadership."}
{"text":"On Saturday we came in for lunch. Long story short my 8 year old daughter was walking to get fortune cookies and slip. She banged her head on a wood panel by the soda fountain. While on the floor I told one of the employees named Crystal that she should clean the water on the floor. Nobody walked up to us and asked if she was ok! Nobody took a report or any information. Customers came to my aid and showed more concern than any employee in that restaurant. When we were walking out I approached Crystal and asked her why didn't she clean up the water. She was smiling the whole time like it was funny. And made the comment \" that it wasn't her fault people spill ice on the floor.\" We spend a few hours in the emergency room last night. We will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered our food and sat down. A couple minutes later we are approached, Stating we are out of White Rice?! Is there anything else we can get you. We replied no just our money back. 
How can an Asian Restaurant not have white rice. There are plenty of other locations, if they were low on inventory couldn't you of gotten supplies from another location. Very disappointed, we go to Pei Wei quit often and to have this turns out being tthe worst experience I have ever had of any restaurant. For an Asian company to run out of white rice. It's unheard of. Also For the manager not even come to our table to apologize for the shortage of a product they should have is another disappointment. We got our money back for the food but I also bought a drink but now I have no use for it since I bought it to go with my meal. If I could give it zero stars I would but it's not an option.
On top of the rice issue. The tables outside were never cleared off while we were there for over 40 minutes. And they were not even busy at 6:30 on a Saturday night, now I know why."}
{"text":"This is now, \"Pei Wei Test Kitchen.\" I was very disappointed, food is bland and no option to order off regular menu. I will not be return to this location."}
{"text":"On the upper end of chain restaurants. 

Three of my classmates and I came here when we got free coupons to try out their new Korean BBQ.

It was surprisingly good! However, it had that taste, the kind that screams MSG. I've had much better Korean BBQ in Seoul, Korea and in LA's Korea-town. The Korean BBQ beef here is American styled and not very authentic. The texture of the sauce is like Panda Express sweet and sour sauce. The price for this is under $8, but for that I believe there are better options. They should probably lower the price to $6. But despite all of that, it's still has the best Korean BBQ from any Asian chain restaurant. 

My friend ended up getting us some egg rolls, which was decent. However, the sauce they gave us tasted like I was dipping my roll in nail polish. It was awful. 

They do have cool machines though. Their the ones that that are digital and you choose your drink from the screen."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here as far as the food. The food was tasty. The problem was everything else. First thing to greet everyone coming in was am overflowing and smelly garbage can. It was pretty disgusting. Then when I got my food, I found what appeared to be a SHARD OF GLASS in the salt for my edamame. I brought it to the attention of the woman taking orders in the front. She assured me she would speak to the manager about it. I sat back down and finished my meal and absolutely nobody came to speak to me about it. So I'm assuming you're just cool with glass in your food? Lastly, I had stacked my dishes and had just finished popping my edamame onto the top most plate when a server came by and snatched my plate away. Sure, my plates were stacked and one might make a reasonable assumption that I was finished, except that I had my chopsticks in my hand and was actively eating off the plate. He didn't even look back to see my face filed with disappointment. 

Sure, I could have yelled and made a big fuss, but I'm not that type of person. This was a tasty, but really disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Out of fried rice at 8pm on a Friday night? Really? Good food and good service though."}
{"text":"So much better than the dysfunctional Panda Exp just a block away! Why? They serve you efficiently. They prepare your order for you hot and fresh. The food is better tasting. And most importantly for this celiac, Pei Wei offers a number of gluten-free menu options. Panda can't be bothered with GF. Pei Wei for me and my family!"}
{"text":"We love this place. It is like PF Chang's but less expensive. It is casual dining. Great service and I love that you can see into the kitchen. Get the Pei Wei Card if you go often. You can earn a free entree. Easy take-out too."}
{"text":"They have made a lot of changes to this location since I was last here a few years ago. The tables are all extremely close together with no privacy at all. I came in for take out the other night and everyone was nice and my order came up quickly, but I can't say I was impressed with my meal.  It was very cookie-cutter and nothing special and I probably won't go back. However it does seem healthier and fresher than eating at, say, Panda Express."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Pei Wei in years.  My family saw the recent orange chicken ads and wanted to try it again.  We got there around 6. Loud atmosphere, unable to hold a conversation without raising your voice and adding to the noisy environment.  Seating feels cramped. We had to sit by the wall separating the line and our table.  Very uncomfortable with people in line watching you eat and customers leaning over where my wife was sitting.  The line was long and slow moving, with oblivious customers that would try to cut ahead when they came in through the online ordering pickup entrance.  Awful drink and condiment area, terribly laid out constantly getting congested.  Many low calorie drinks were out on both fountain machines.  I did not like the orange chicken, and I am very forgiving with orange chicken.   My wife ordered the Mongolian beef, which I tasted great.  I wish I had ordered the same.   The dining experience was so loud and irritating, and getting disappointing tasting food just made me not want to come back for a very long time."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to take me out to celebrate my birthday, and we decided to come to Pei Wei. We walk in and check out the menu and proceed to order our meals. We have decided on. 
 

 
 

I settled for a regular size KungPao with noodles for an extra 99 cents and a  drink for two dollars and change. Which brought my total to around $13 dollars .
 

 
 

The ambiance basically sit yourself, and you wait for them to bring your food to your table. The food itself wasn't all that spicy and under whelming to say the least, but it was edible, for the most part. I have to say that I would find spicier Asian food from Panda Express and that's not saying much considering the fact this is the height of Americanized faux Asian food. 


Frankly, if I wanted lackluster food I could easily purchase some hot pockets from any grocery store or just grab something to eat from Mcdonalds.Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"We love eating here but the quality of the food is really declining 
Here is a picture of what I ordered \"Orange Chicken \" and a picture of what I was served"}
{"text":"Sometimes changing the menu is a good thing. Unfortunately,  not in this case. It is just ok now. We were not impressed the last few times."}
{"text":"This place is another anti-gun, anti 2nd Amendment Rights,  anti Personal protection, anti American place to eat. On the rare occasion when my wife wants to eat at a anti American place it will be only once. I never return to a place that I have to set aside my personal protection and they have none. 

Now onto the food. We tried to massive disappointment the pot stickers.  Extremely over fried and stale tasting. Worst we have ever eaten. 

I had the Kung Pou Shrimp with brown rice. Spicey but not overpowering.  Still very flavorful, tastey, and one of the best versions I have had in a very long time. Excellent with the brown rice.  

My wife had the Honey Chicken. She loved the flavors. Sweet but not overly. You can still enjoy it without being in a sugar shock as many place do. On her dish she went with a small. It would have been nice to know that a small is a child's size plate. Expecially after we were asked if we had been there before and said no. 

Overall it is a very good place that will be added to the many Anti-Gun establishments that many of us will never visit again. Take down the small anti-gun sign."}
{"text":"For being fairly \"fast\" food.. Pei Wei (pronounced pay way I confirmed haha) is pretty darn good. we got a few things to share. I had the Asian chicken salad and was impressed! There was a decent amount of chicken. Some more veggies would be nice, but overall pretty good. The steak teriyaki was great as well as the fried rice. Over all good was good! Nice, clean, and reasonable."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out on this visit. I received great service and friendly greeting from Jessica. In my opinion, the restaurant was understaffed for the lunch crowd on this visit. They also did not cook my spring rolls, so they were uncooked when i arrived at my office to eat (how does this happen?). 3 stars for the excellent service, and the remainder of the meal was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food and service were very good! Thank you Ivy for great service! I had the Chang's Spicy lunch with light sauce... But the sauce was not light. So service great, food ok... Cooks didn't t pay attention to customer request...which is not good"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is average at best. They tend to burn things and while they look like they are hauling ass in the 4' by 4' square they run in behind the counter, they actually get very little done. I know its fun to watch them like hampsters bumping into each other, but over all I just don't care for it particularly. I also think it was sad the guy could not spell John right. SRSLY."}
{"text":"Went out with my family to this restaurant. We ordered the Mongolian beef, 2 orders of orange chicken and mango tofu. The cashier told us that it would be a 25 minute wait on the food. One order of orange chicken and the Mongolian beef arrived. The orange chicken was mostly batter and flavorless and the beef was dry and had the texture of jerky. Our other two orders didn't arrive for another ten minutes the tofu first and then finally the second order of orange chicken. This order of chicken, however, was all batter and no chicken. It looked like they just scraped up the bottom of the pan of leftovers. Absolutely disappointing compared to previous visits at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Remodel is not good at the Mesa location (Val Vista and Baseline). Seating is very tight (probably to get more people packed in).  Food seems different too. Disappointed as this used to be one of our regular places to frequent but doubt we will be back now."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat here but I stopped today. All I have to say is-It really Shouldn't take 15 minutes for a to go order of white rice!"}
{"text":"Been here many times before but its been awhile. Decided to go tonight and literally expected G. Ramsey to walk out at any moment and shut the place down. Seriously, it was complete chaos. They changed the menu. The guy taking the order kept walking off to check things. There was no ice or clean silver wear. The appetizer came out and was only warm and wasn't as good as usual. You could hear and see customers complaining and getting refunds all over the place. The staff all seemed confused. My entree finally came out, also not hot, but my girlfriends didn't show up for another 10 minutes.  All during this they kept going to the wrong tables with food and looking confused.  It was crazy, finally gave up, got a refund from the manager and went next door for dinner.  I won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"Always liked Pei Wei before but very disappointed in the new menu. If I want Panda orange chicken, I'll go to Panda, where it is better. Really preferred Pei Wei's old recipe. Also portion sizes have shrunk. And even the lettuce was cut weird. Will have to find somewhere new."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the new recipe for the orange chicken. If I want Panda, I'll go to Panda. Old recipe was so much better. Also portions smaller and even lettuce not cut correctly. Need to find a new place!"}
{"text":"Not good. Ordered Kung Pao, they have no idea how to make it properly. Pei Wei used to be good, no more!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and I have been disappointed each time.  I am a lover of all things Chinese food but this restaurant misses the mark for me.  My issue is the overall flavor of the food, as it is definitely different than normal Chinese food. To put it eloquent, it is yucky. To be fair, if you like Asian Fusion type food, then you will probably like this restaurant.  My husband likes this restaurant and pops over for lunch from time to time- thus the 2 stars instead of 1 for me."}
{"text":"Worst Pei Wei experience ever tonight. For our party of four, they brought three of our four meals together and told us the forth would be out in 5 min. 15 min later we asked if someone could check on it and were told that it was put in as a to go order and the to go orders were behind. It finally came out after 30 min. One of entrees smelled like lighter fluid and was inedible. We asked to speak with a manger and were told he was too busy to speak with us right now. Completely disappointed in every aspect of the service."}
{"text":"What happen to you pei wei? R u still related to pf Changs? Wow, you are just meeting up with the family standard. Or is it just this location. ? 3 star is strictly for the wonderful employees here. Sooo helpful and wonderful. Food? Sesame chicken is just toooooooo sweet! Fried rice? Recommended for sure! Honey Sears? Bleh! Others? Okay and so so. Place is clean and that's important. Not bad for a quick stop chow. I will come again. Oh yeah! Don't irder the chopped salad :)"}
{"text":"What the hell happened here?? The service is slow, food is mediocre, quality is slipping, dining area is dirty and decrepit... This used to be an inexpensive alternative to PF Changs.. Now it's a half step above Denny's. You're off your game BIG TIME."}
{"text":"This was my first time here... So like any another person, my mom and i told the cashier \"this is our time here. Do you mind explaining the menu\" looked at us like we were hassling him. He wasnt so helpful, so it was like picking out of a bowl and hopefully what we picked taste good. Luckily, mom liked hers and as did i. Will i be coming back... Sure why not!? Word of advice to the cashiers... Learn the menu and be a little more helpful and out going."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but they've taken some of my favorites off the menu and everything that loaded with peanuts. I got the Vietnamese rolls and even though I really dislike peanuts I usually can pick them out. There was more peanuts in these two than any other ingredients. They are pre made and clearly sat for a while because the lettuce was soggy and it was falling apart. It's unfortunate those aren't made to order or at lease for people who would like to omit something out of them."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I will be back. Some of the shrimps in one of our dishes still had some tails on which was hard to tell since they were breaded and had sauce on it. It is an unpleasant thing to chew on!! The chicken was way too lemony. The pot stickers were too crunchy, the sushi was warm. We had also ordered the lettuce wraps and the amount of meat in general in all our dishes was mediocre. The vegetable was also grated carrot basically. You had to look for the other vegetable . Quite disappointing!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this place. Now it's so bad, the soda machine is out of all the flavors, they changed from nice thick white napkins, now they give out cheap think brown ones. Their bathroom stinks like an animal die in there and no staff bother checking."}
{"text":"Why us this Steakhouse review on the Pei Wei review site?
We had lunch at Peii Wei Dana Park Mesa.
We ordered 2 Sweet snd Sour Chicken w/ brown rice. Food was barely warm. Rice was like glue, no flavor. Not sure what type of chicken was used? Was served with maybe a 1/4 cup sweet and sour sauce, a faint hint of sauce. I requested more sauce from one employee, he then started cleaning tables, sweeping the floor so after waiting a reasonable time I  went to counter area and ask another employee, for more sauce, about 8 min. later he brought one 1/4 cup.
We won't be eating here again. Sorry, honest review."}
{"text":"I'm not too ashamed to admit that I actually *like* Pei Wei. Of course, this is also my favorite location due to the building they are in. 

It's a historic adaptave reuse that they really did a great job with. The menu is great because they really offer crowd pleasing food (uninteresting) at pretty fair prices. I spend less on take out here than if I go to China Chili, and the portions are about the same. They also give me the option of having brown rice which is great. 

Their mongolian beef I'm quite sure is filled with meth or crack or something. It's a very addicting flavor, and helps to make sure you get your years worth of sodium that day."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. My husband and I came here to dinner tonight, December 9, 2017. I was craving shrimp. My husband ordered a chicken bowl with chicken. I ordered the original Pei Wei Bowl with shrimp. I know I ordered shrimp as I mentioned as I made the comment when ordering that I was craving shrimp. When our order was brought to our table mine was not shrimp but chicken. I told the server and she came back with register receipt that said chicken on both. I suggested possibly the guy who took our order might have put the order in incorrectly. No offer to redo it after I specifically kept saying I really wanted shrimp and that was what I ordered!!!!!!  Still no offer to make me, the customer happy. I work in retail and the \" customer is always right\". Not so at Pei Wei. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Once again, Pei Wei deserves a 1-star rating.

In the past, I've had a recurring problem with the rice being served at room temperature, likely because they put the rice on the plate ahead of the main dish being ready to add to the plate.

Tonight my wife and I returned to Pei Wei, about 6-7 weeks after our last cold-rice experience.  I ordered my usual Mongolian Beef and asked for hot rice when I ordered the food.  I explained that the rice is usually served room temperature and that I wanted it hot this time.

Well, they served me my Mongolian Beef.  The rice is warm, the beef is hot, but he mushrooms are refrigerator cold.  What?  It's like they cook the beef first and throw the mushrooms in at the last moment just so they get mixed with the beef and sauce.  Nope, doesn't work.

Why is the food always served with some part of it being cold?  It's just poor quality.  Actually, I have come to the conclusion that Panda Express is higher quality.  True!

My wife and I have given Pei Wei so many opportunities to fix their problems.  We've been more than generous in giving Pei Wei the opportunity to fix their problems.  We've simply given up.  We won't be eating at Pei Wei again."}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE. Last time we ate here we didn't feel so hot the next day so it took us about a year to give it another try. We got take out, ordered there then waited for it. We waited as people after us were getting their food. When we asked about ours (at least 20 min later), the cashier said they were waiting on the spring rolls. Still waiting about 5 minutes later the cashier asked the chef if they had the spring rolls and he said he had already made them. Well turns out they never made them and we had to wait another 5 or so minutes for them to be finished. Also they had no carbonation for their beverages, however they were nice enough to tell the customers before hand but that didn't leave really any drink options.



Much better service the second time! Got the orange chicken, it's still good, large portions (even the small) and the drink machine worked!!"}
{"text":"Love Pei Wei, but not this one. I've lived around the corner for years now and it has consistently been bad. Undercooked, oversauced, and poorly staffed.  I don't get it. Every other Pei Wei I've ever been to has been great. This one needs help."}
{"text":"I am a full time regular here. I also am gluten free. They have a wonderful menu, well educated staff and I'm always greeted with a smile :) I prefer this one over the Val Vista one ANY DAY. My food comes out consistent and within a few minutes. Great place to go!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food a chain. You do get a lot of food for the price. However, every time I have ordered online there has been a mistake. Sometimes they tell me they never even received my order when I received the confirmation email. Also, if you in during a busy time and have a teenage girl as a cashier, you're chances of having a pleasant experience with her are slim to none. This has happened to me multiple times with multiple different cashiers. I have spoken to the manager and he is always very apologetic, but I guess you just can't get stressed teenage girls to be nice to customers. I will continue to go here as the food is good for the price and they are relatively quick with preparation. Nice options if you're veggies as well."}
{"text":"Love the caramel chicken here.  It was busy. Nothing over the top, but good standard pei Wei!"}
{"text":"always get great service and the food is always great....my FAVORITE asian place ever!  friendly service...most of the time very fast."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot and it's consistently decent. Most of the protein options are good (Orange peel, ginger broccoli and honey seared are all good), and that's where the good stops. 

Sushi - Terrible
Salads - Bad
Egg rolls/Salad rolls - Terrible
Lettuce wraps - The worst I've ever seen.
Soups - Decent"}
{"text":"This is Phoenix, a city that is not associated with top notch chinese food. Pei Wei is really good I enjoy it they do have a really good selection of healthy options. No this is not \"authentic\" but it's good and the quality has stayed the same for years now. Now the reason they got 3 stars is in the past 6 months the portion sizes have drastically shrunk, once upon a time your take out containers were so full mixing could only be accomplished by transferring to a large bowl NOT so now mix it without too much worry of rice spilling out. Not good business practice I think especially at the higher prices that went up a year ago."}
{"text":"This really is the worst location I have been to. We stopped going for awhile as they always mess up to go orders. We have been to plenty other Pei Wei's and funny they seem to bad able to manage to fill an order correctly.  So you get home and it's wrong or you find it in the restaurant and wait another 10-15 min to fix.   Made the mistake to give them a try tonight and sure enough. Wrong. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We have ordered take out here for years. Usually it's consistent and good. But recently the rice has been weird tasting, and last night two orders of Pei Wei Spicy chicken were missing the spicy part. I guess they forgot the spices. Very bland and tasted similar to cream of wheat oatmeal. Too much break down of communication somewhere. We will find a new Asian take out spot."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely amazing. I thought the food was delicious especially the hot and sour soup. The staff was amazing especially Hector."}
{"text":"I'm going to get shot for saying this but I don't care... I typically prefer Americanized Chinese food to its' \"authentic\" counterpart. Yup, I'd rather eat here than 80% of SMR. I'm entitled to my opinion, no matter how stupid or weird it is damnit ! The place is clean, I don't get nasty MSG bloat after eating here, and the service is actually good. It's reliable and I don't get weird grisley meat pieces like you get in hole in the wall type spots. I have my reasons, and sometimes good ole reliable Pei Wei is a better option for me than being \"adventurous\" and eating the fish swimming around the murky smelly tank in Chinatown !


What I love about Pei Wei:
*Quick - I can order online and pick it up in 10 minutes
*Cheap and reliable
*I can add on teriyaki noodles for like $2 
*I can make my rice into fried rice for $1 more
*Honey seared chicken ROCKS

Yup, Pei Wei never lets me down !"}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei's food! I have been going to this location and others for many years and I have never had bad service or food. I love the patio at this location as well. The only downfall is it gets extremely busy around lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The place is clean. Friendly staff, good food except the portion size. I got a chicken sesame and I was hungry! So I ordered the regular size, my gf got the small portion Mongolian beef and she had way more meat even with all her broccoli. Come to think about it the cooks where looking at me suspiciously, And they should concentrate on the stove not the customers. Very unwelcoming, none said hi even though I came close and made eye contact."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Decided to dine in instead of take out. Wish I would have done take out. Sitting at the table next to the fountain machine and a roach starts crawling up the wall. Not cool."}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorite places.
Portion sizes have probably halved, prices have probably doubled.
The service is terrible, the food is still amazing but everything else sucks!
How do you get 1/2 the food for double the price?"}
{"text":"Not really much point in calling in an order when it takes longer than 15 minutes for them to answer the phone. This happens on a regular basis. I'm not sure why they can't figure this out. When I arrive to place my order in person because I can't get them to answer the phone, the entire restaurant is empty."}
{"text":"Only got 2 snow peas in my salad :( but other than that the spicy chicken salad was delicious and the guy at the register was very friendly."}
{"text":"This location is usually a nightmare to get in and out of. Long lines and sometimes it take awhile to get your food. Not this day. I ordered my dinner online and it was ready and waiting for me when I walked in to pick it up. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and a vegetable egg roll. You get enough for two with lettuce wraps and I was thankful I didn't have to share. They were so good. I ate it all.  The vegetable roll was fresh and delicious. This might be my go to meal for a while. I throughly enjoyed my meal and my experience with ordering this time."}
{"text":"After our last visit to Pei Wei we won't back. The food is just way too sweet and there's nothing on the menu that isn't a sugar bomb. Panda Express, which I'm not a fan of, is so much better. 

Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this fake Asian food designed to taste like a candy bar. What are they thinking putting chicken, coated in a sugary sauce on a salad. ICK!

Here's what we got. An appetizer, two entrees and two drinks for almost $30. Way overpriced and tastes awful. 

Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Called to place a take out order as their website was not allowing online orders and directed you to call instead. I was on hold for over 10 minutes, never spoke to an actual person, just stuck listening to their elevator music and a prompt that suggested I make my order online instead of waiting. Funny. I had about 45 mins to get some dinner, and these 10 minutes were a waste of time. Also, the last time I dined in, my food took forever to arrive and was no longer hot. One of my orders being soup. Thought I would have better luck this time but I was wrong."}
{"text":"Not a good tonight at this Pei Wei. It was well past dinner time and we were all starving. I waited about 10 min for my to go order which included two orders of chicken lettuce wraps. When we got home to eat, NO LETTUCE!! How are we supposed to eat our LETTCE WRAPS with no lettuce?? I called and the person said \" you're welcome to come back and get your lettuce' I'll give you extra even!\" I was so bugged. I sent my hubby over there and at least they sort of redeemed themselves by giving us a $5 gift card. I watched the girl put my order in the bag and she didn't even double check what was supposed to go in before she handed It to me. I'm usually fairly happy but this was extra annoying and taught me to check that it's all there no matter what! After all of that, there was WAY more rice than the main dish in each of the orders we had. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering online it doesn't work. Drove waybout of my way for this place and was force to give them my email to use some bogus promo code that never was found. Not empressed won't bother coming back"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is a joke. We have many issues with this place. Either their phones don't work to take orders or their computers are not working to take online orders or they run out of certain food items.    When you are able to get your order complete online it gives you an estimated time to pick up. What they don't tell you is once you go to pick up your order you need to wait another 20-30 minutes. Why can't they just say it'll be ready in an hour. So while we are waiting we also noticed several dine-in customers go to order their food only to watch them walk out. Good thing the cooks can joke around and have fun while everyone is waiting for their food. Can you give negative stars?"}
{"text":"We tried to order food online for us and our out-of-town guests, but Pei Wei's online ordering was down and we couldn't even view the menu on their website. So we just went. They were very busy with other people ordering takeout. I selected the Sweet & Sour Chicken (steamed) with fried rice. They said 15-20 minutes. I waited outside with my dogs, but my b/f said one of the workers was very rude to him. When we got the food home, I liked the sweet & sour chicken, but the fried rice was obviously made with brown rice! What the heck?! We just ate Pei Wei a month or so ago and it wasn't that way. Did they change their recipe recently? Or was that a mistake? I tolerated the brown rice, but I wasn't happy about it... Also, two people tried the sauce for the lettuce wraps and said that it tasted rancid. Gross! I think we'll stick with Panda after that experience."}
{"text":"I love treating myself to Pei Wei every now and then so when I was done with a heavy workout, I ordered online to pick up on the way home. I ordered extra tofu and chicken for an additional $4 but when I got my food I was extremely disappointed. It was overfilled with rice rather than the extra tofu and chicken I requested, minimal sauce, and a couple pieces of the chicken were rubbery. It was kind of gross to get past what chicken I did have on my plate. It was a waste of money ordering \"more\" food when it was the same portion as if I didn't add the extras. To top it off, the staff was unfriendly. The cashier who handed me my food didn't offer utensils or soy sauce (granted, it was in front of the register but usually you'd think it would be pointed out since that's a new thing I guess) and didn't have the common courtesy to say \"thanks/have a nice day\". This location was a bust for me."}
{"text":"Today this review is based only on the customer service I experienced. I stopped in at 1:00 pm (4/2/15) to pick up lunch to-go. The cashier was a little rude right away, lacking anything close that resembles a personality. Coupled with her opened-mouth gum chewing, I wondered for a second if in fact Pete Carroll was taking my order. 

As I recited my order to her with modifications, she just looked at me, rather than keying in those modifications. As she read my order back to me, she did not include anything I had just told her. I ended up repeating my order to her 2 more times, and when I got back to my office, surprise, surprise, my order was WRONG.

Seeing that her core job responsibilities include providing a positive customer experience through a cheery disposition and listening to customers relay their orders; I think perhaps this young woman would be better suited to bus tables until her attitude and desire to apply herself improves.

Wish I could provide her name for management, but rather than give me my receipt (she asked me if I wanted it, to which I replied 'yes') she threw it away right in front of me instead.

A real peach you got there."}
{"text":"Lunch at Pei Wei is basically a done deal.  Food is consistently fast and good.  The staff was very accommodating, basically creating a new dish that my son would eat, but giving us the child's price still.

Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This is a great pei wei they are always very fast with takeout. Parking is plentiful unlike some other Pei wei in the valley. Very clean establishment and people are always very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great pei wei with really friendly staff!  I order takeout from here all the time and they always get my order right and fast.  If you're in the neighborhood checkout this pei wei and if you've never ate at pei wei before the food is sooo good!"}
{"text":"Never been to one of these places before and first experience was good. The weather was nice and we had outdoor seating.  The service was very quick the sushi was good for a non Japanese sushi joint. Its one step up on lunds."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei because it is a consistent product. Ingredients are fresh, well prepared, and you know you will get the same quality every time. Service at this location can be hit or miss... but it's usually pretty good. The mobile app and online ordering are very convenient, and for what you get, the prices are reasonable for the portions."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero stars if allowed. I have been to this particular location only a handful of times. Last time I was here they gave me the regular, gluten-laden Spicy Chicken by mistake which was easily remedied since I was there physically. The manager apologized profusely and made me a new meal quickly. Today the girls from my office placed an order of maybe 4 meals including mine which was GF. They brought the lunch back to the office as we only have a limited time to eat. When I discovered my chicken was breaded I called and spoke to the manager who was rather rude and copped a tude with me. Additionally he offered no apology whatsoever. He went on to say he personally bagged my order asking how I could tell the order was not GF. [Really? How does a manager not know this?!]  He offered only a refund of my money. After he processed my credit he immediately hung up. So I guess I get to be hangry the rest of the day lol. At least it's Friday right?! 
Very. Poor. Customer service. Not to mention lack of food knowledge of the restaurant he manages is a real shame. Shows he has not been adequately trained and doesn't give a hoot about the GF issue or customers. The manager SHOULD have taken this as a learning experience and educated himself and his staff but sadly, he chose not to. Hangry Donna will not be back to any Pei Wei's in the future and wrote this Yelp review instead. Hangry Donna's coworkers are staying clear of her this afternoon. Chang's should hang their head in shame."}
{"text":"You always liked P.f. Chang's, cause they're ok for 'americanized' chinese food, and 'cause they gots the gluten-free menu. But you wanted it faster and didn't want to need a reservation or dress up (at all). And, you wanted giant digital lcd screen menus like shit from 'Blade Runner'. 

Shazam-o! 

Pei Wei was born, conjured up fer you by the Chang-ers themselves.  

~ The end ~"}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars, only because the counter cashier girl is wonderful. She is polite and very apologetic for a slow and rude male cook. While waiting to pick up a slow take out order, she would apologize and say that the meal was coming with a smile. The cook would stare and mumble something , clearly ticked off. Now the food, TERRRIBLE/ INEDIBLE/ SALTY/ OVERCOOKED!!! Yuck never again!!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss ...  have had good lunches in the past, salads. Just ordered dinner for pickup and the sushi was terrible. Very dry, like it had been in the refrigerator for hours. Not dependable quality."}
{"text":"Rating a 4 star because the food is always fresh and delicious. Minimal wait time for food and friendly staff. Some of the evening staff is young, immature, kids but other than that it's on me of my regular spots that hits the spot."}
{"text":"Horrible service
It took 6 calls and 2 hang ups before I could place my order
Wrong name on order
Long WAIT yet NO ONE in the place
Cold OLD edamames"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place. I came in a belt 4 days ago with my boyfriend. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps with a cup of , wonton soup and he ordered the orange fried shrimp with rice I believe. 

OMG LET ME tell you the chicken lettuce wraps are absolutely phenomenal literally every single bite was mouth watering. A really nice soy sauce salty flavor with white meat chicken, mushrooms, water chestnuts, scallions and , garlic sever with this crispy stuff with nicly cut lettues perfect for scooping the yummy delicious chicken. The wonton soup was just equally good nice and savory broth. 

This is were thing changed. I came back yestarday and decided to try something new on the menu. I went with the chicken Thai mango at the recommendation of the woman who took my order. I asked for it to be extra spicy I also ordered the crab lagoons and the hot and sour soup with a glass of wine.

 I sat at the bar area. The whole entire time I was there I was not greeted by one employee. Nobody asked how it was doing if I was enjoying my food or if I needed anything. In fact I had to flag the waiters down multiple times. Once for napkins the second time for silverware and the third time to get a glass of water. 

I did not enjoy the thia mango whatsoever.  The chunks of meat are absolutely huge way too big. The whole entire dish was drowning in peanuts I pulled out at least 45. The veggies were not soft at all they're very hard. And this sause was not spicy at all.

 I only eat a few bites. The lettuce that I got was absolutely horrible it look like they just ripped a patch off it off it was so mangled that I couldn't even eat it as a wrap which is very disappointing. 

The crab lagoons on the other side where the highlight of my meal they had a very generous amount of crap and the yummy sweet topped it off. I also had the hot and sour soup which was good had a nice thick consistency.

I feel like for spending $21 the customer service was not up to par nor the food/ particular  menu item i ordered.  I would consider coming back but I'll probably only get  lettuce wraps I'm scared to try something different and not like it again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. We live 30 mins. From here so we ordered online and drove down to pick it up. We ordered LETTUCE wraps and two chicken bowls. In fact, I ordered EXTRA lettuce for the wraps. When we got home I opened the bag to find they didn't include ANY lettuce for the wraps nor did they include the sauce. Also, there was probably 5 pieces of chicken in one bowl and an overwhelming  amount of white rice. The other bowl had maybe 5 pieces of chicken if that, broccoli that wasn't cooked all the way and a bunch of rice. The chicken in both bowls was DISGUSTING! We ended up taking a few bites and throwing  everything in the trash. Don't waste your time trying to get in contact with corporate because they can't be bothered to email you back. This company sucks just like the food. Don't waste your money!!"}
{"text":"Expensive chain restaurant.  If you're in the mood for stir fry, there are worse options.  They have a neat spin on some things.  I've been a few times and they've had good service and been clean every time.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This honestly deserves 0 stars and unfortunately I'm very disappointed in this specific Pei Wei because I once loved this restaurant. I've called in and ordered multiple times and every time I've been placed on hold or no one has picked up, okay no big deal do your thing or I'll just call back; my hold had consisted of at LEAST A 20 min hold, LITERALLY ... okay now big deal. If I wasn't so stubborn I would hung up after 5. Tonight, tonight was a little different. I walked in to pick up my order and Watched TWO girls WATCH the phone ring. I was actually 10 mins late picking up my order yet it still was not ready yet. They asked me to sit and wait. So I did. 20 of waiting I walk up and ask what the hold up is. They hand me a bag, almost out the door they yell \"wait\" that's not your order, only for them to realize my order had been sitting on the counter the entire time. Honestly I feel horrible for these girls if this is what their being taught from upper management, upper management needs some intense training. Pei Wei continues to get worse ."}
{"text":"530pm on a Sunday and they have their doors locked. This is the third ( of four attempts) go grab dinner from this place.

Good thing there are other places to eat at, like the Summit Diner and Hacienda."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants! I always get the honey seared chicken because it's just the right mixture of sweet and tangy goodness! I like to add on veggies for $0.99 more to get delicious crunchy snap peas, carrots and broccoli. A regular bowl costs about $8 with the veggies added on.

I also like their chili paste, it's kind of sweet and just the right amount of spicy. They make it there in the restaurant so it's always fresh and good. It goes very well in their lettuce wraps! (Which are also amazing.) I have tried both traditional and the Thai lettuce wraps, they are equally good but I always go more for the traditional.

The only thing I would have to say is I don't like their Sweet and Sour bowls. Something is off in the recipe so it doesn't taste like what it should in my opinion. Other than that the Pei Wei locations I've been to have always been clean with polite and courteous staff happy to answer any questions I have."}
{"text":"Got a poke bowl! Was all good till I discover a COCKROACH in it! Pretty disgusted! Will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"The kids always want to eat here, so we did again, even though they haven't gotten any of our takeout orders right for 2 years.  I always object. Very unfortunate for us that we stopped in for more disappointment. 

Tonight, we ordered dine in. Big mistake. We ordered chicken chow main, lettuce wraps and the teriyaki crunch roll. All the food was just terrible, even the service: the server dropped our serving spoon on the ground with part of the food from the plate and never returned. 

The chicken in the lettuce wraps didn't have any green onions, or water chestnuts, and the lettuce was hot and wilted (brown rotten). There were some crumbs of dried \"something\" on it. Chicken?  Who knows. 

When I inquired, they said they'd run out of their ground chicken mix for that dish and substituted. (What?, dirt). Then why offer it?

This is a big company that doesn't really care anymore. LAST time going here and my next generation agrees.  

Unfortunately, they'll be out of business soon.  Maybe we'll try the \"before divorce\" PF Changs. Or, the Mandarin Buffet. 10x better with sushi and 1/2 the price. Still, you'll have no idea where the \"chicken\" comes from at either place. 

Peiwei said they would refund the lettuce wraps, but it would take a few days for the refund.  So, they can charge you immediately, and immediately debit your bank account, but you have to wait for a refund. 

They think you'll forget. I won't. 

Craziness."}
{"text":"Definitely falls into the \"what where they thinking?\" category. Our  neighborhood Pei Wei - a block from our offices and a weekly favorite for 5 years, has changed to Pei Wei Asian Market - a sort of cheap food court concept, without the mall. Obviously this is a more inexpensive operation to run. Portions are a lot smaller, and about a dollar or two cheaper. Not all bad, but many favorites seem to be gone. 

Plastic has replaced the restaurant-ware, and not cool custom plastic, but basic restaurant supply take-away stock. No green PR there. The warm, PF-asian decor has been replaced by a basic black and industrial box with so much parking lot glare during lunch that it's hard to select your plastic utensils from the self-serve area. The restaurant is now noisy and the seemingly uncomfortable staff calling out order numbers adds to the din. 

Now in all fairness, we've tried the restaurant a few times since the reopen. The food was fine every time and the flavors good. Not where I'd go if I was hungry, but the value seemed good. Truly, if this was in the mall, it would likely do fine. Unfortunately it's not. Alas we mourn the loss of our local Pei Wei."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  I like this Pei Wei (WARNING) just do not come here between 1115am-1230pm unless you want to wait for the business crowd.  Its  a favorite location due to being so close to starbucks and right off of 7th ave.  Parking is terrible during these hours also.  If you do want to come here for lunch during your work day I would suggest try getting here at 11am at least you wont have to wait long.  I usually call in and go pick it up if I cant make the 11am window.  

The food is good.  As good as pei wei gets.  Its always fresh and the taste and texture is what I would expect.  My favorite is probably the curry chicken.  I ask for extra spicy.  The pot stickers are awesome too they are deep fried though.  They have this chilli sauce by the soda fountain that is killer.  I love it.  

Overall I would say not a family friendly place during lunch hours but anytime after the lunch rush is good.  Get your Pei Wei on."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in quite some time. It isn't really close to my house and it is just outside the, \"is it worth the drive?\" zone for us. Still, I am surprised by the bunch of negative reviews here.

The place is a little less fancy than I remember it. Gone are the massive electronic displays for the menus, and the place is showing its age a bit.

There was nothing wrong with our visit. The food was fine -- kids offerings are a bit on the bland side, but they ARE catering to kids who may not like \"weird\" flavors, so I understand that.

I had Dan Dan noodles with chicken this time. The presentation was nice and the food was served hot. It was a bit less spicy than I remember, but a bit of chili sauce solved that. 

I usually drink tea, so I don't need to fight for a spot at the Coke Freestyle machines unless I need ice. Those things are nice, but they cause drink-traffic jams at every place I've seen them. Instead of giving people 6 choices, they have a thousand. That kind of decision takes more time. :/

Anyway, the people who helped us find a seat were friendly and the team clearing the tables was pretty much on it. The place was really crowded -- coupons for free General Tso chicken came out."}
{"text":"Coming from NY, I've been looking for good Chinese food here in CLT. I've yet to find a place I'd return to. As a result, Pei Wei has become my standby for acceptable, reasonably priced Chinese. It has good, solid Asian flavors. Nothing extraordinary, nothing amazing, and almost always too high in sodium, but at least the flavors work. 

I've had many things on the menu and tend to rotate between the Mandarin Kung Pao, Pei Wei Spicy and the occasional Orange Peel. Truth be told, the sauces are all kind of similar, just the veggies change out. 

I'm not a fan of their wonton soup, it tries too hard to be fancy. The hot and sour soup is not hot enough. Usually I go with either the lettuce wraps or the spring rolls if I want an appetizer. 

I still wish I could find a good Chinese place, but in the interim, Pei Wei works."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei (and PF Changs) and enjoy being able to grab a quick bite for lunch or dinner. Food, service, atmosphere, etc are all pretty consistently good and worthy of a recommendation. 

However, the last time I went I was pretty blown away (enough so to motivate me to share my experience)! My boyfriend and I went in on Sunday afternoon for lunch. We both ordered Wok dishes (me- Mongolian beef and him- caramel chicken), fixed our drinks and found a table. Within minutes my dish came out, quickly served hot and delicious per usual. We had planned to kind of share our meals so we both started picking at the plate. A few more minutes pass and before we even realize that his meal hadn't come yet, an employee comes over and apologizes for the long wait and overs my BF a free appetizer of his choice. He orders crab rangoons. They almost immediately bring 4 rangoons out and then before he/we can even eat all of them here comes his dish. We felt lucky! 

But the customer service gets even better!! We're sitting there happily chomping away on the (way too much) food we now have in front of us when another employee walks over with a receipt in her hand. She says that her manager apologizes for our long wait and has refunded both of our meals to the card we paid with. WHAT?! We *didn't even complain* and had already been completely satisfied. 

Talk about good restaurant management! Props to Pei Wei for satisfying their customers before they even get a chance to complain!"}
{"text":"Fast service and friendly staff. The staff is always smiling and food always arrives fast!"}
{"text":"Service is a 4  . Very sloppy also the hot and sour soup aint that  bad if u add enough chile paste and salt and soy sauce the gentleman named pop he is the manager great service from him and this other lady did not get her name unfortunetly  I've changed my rating 2 times that's how impressed I am"}
{"text":"Lobe the standard work and customer survive these guys provide. Consistency across all stores. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Convenient. Fast. Delicious. And cheapish. I'd give a 5 star if it was a few bucks cheaper. 
Kung pao chicken is my go to."}
{"text":"I'm here now and have been waiting 20 minutes for my food. Tell me again why I'm eating here? Ugh.  This place used to be so awesome.  I know it's busy but I just had to ask where my food was and got semi brushed off. Won't come here again for sure.  Coming Lainey about extra meat portion being nonexistent.  Gave me two more ounces  but guess what? RAW!!  The meat was raw."}
{"text":"Hadn't had pei Wei in awhile due to a strict diet regimen. Went here for lunch today. They served me RAW beef. In my Mongolian beef entree. The manager came over and gave me a ten dollar gift card to make things right. So that was ok. Prob won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is like the fast food version of PF Chang's. You order and pay, and sit down with a number and they deliver your food (rather quickly, most of the time). There are a bunch of pan Asian options and I like that you can choose to steam your protein. 

I really do enjoy the food, but things are always going awry with my order here. Something is always wrong... wrong meal, wrong rice, etc. It annoys me when I order something like edamame (to me, an \"appetizer\") and it comes out AFTER I've already received my meal. This happens all the time and, at that point, I almost don't want it anymore! One time, there was shrimp accidentally mixed into my husband's sweet and sour chicken. A lot of people are allergic to shrimp (my husband is not one of them) so this seems like a huge mistake! Since he orders the fried and not steamed protein, it's kind of easy to mistake it when you're just taking bites and not paying close attention. 

Usually when I bring these mistakes to the staff's attention they are quick to correct the issue, but it seems to happen all the time. No one ever apologizes or does anything to make us feel like they want to keep our business. 

There's a fairly new rewards program but I don't really know how it works yet. We've gotten a free meal already so if you're going to eat here semi-regularly, it seems to pay off. 

It's close to our house and is a quick and not completely unhealthy option (depending on what and how you order) so it'll remain in the rotation, but I hope they improve the service and take better steps deliver the right food at the right time."}
{"text":"Gets worse every time we go there. This time very little chicken on our honey seared and teriyaki, the regular sizes we ordered was equal to the other small size teriyaki. Hardly any sauce on top and half tray of rice. Poorly presented and looked like all orders rushed and thrown together.
Other visits extra sauce has been forgotten, garnishes have been forgotten. We're probably done and there is a clear trend at this location."}
{"text":"Sadly a favorite place checked off the list. Have been coming to this location for many years, always consistent, always good. 

Today I learned that they have changed their portion size, I got the large (before there was never a choice) but it appeared that label was referring to the size of the undercooked brown rice which was crunchy.

I have always been willing to pay a little bit of a premium at Pei Wei knowing I was getting a good serving and never left hungry. Now I find myself thinking what we will have for dinner and I am still at lunch.

Not a bad experience, but a HUGE fall from the restaurant I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Got pei Wei take out for dinner.  UGH what happened to this place? Food use to be good.

Crab Puffs I wouldn't even give to the dog.  Dan Dan noodles had no taste.  Got a chicken entree and it was just gross threw it out and ate a bowl of cereal."}
{"text":"Can't order from here anymore. They tell you a wait time and consistently make you wait even longer. That is assuming you can even get thru on the phone"}
{"text":"When you actually get your food, it not bad. Sadly they launched an online order system that does not work..... Half hour and still waiting. Online said 15 minutes so that makes it 45 and not close yet......  Gave up after 50 minutes and was given a refund.....  You could see it was staffing issues that seem to plague this location.  Not many places nearby so this is always busy. Its a shame it is so hit or miss on service."}
{"text":"My husband and I love eating at Pei Wei and eat there all the time. This was the first time dining in at this location. The soda machine was out of the majority of its drinks. The ice machine was empty. We waited 10 minutes for my entrée to come out and over 20 for my husbands. The bathroom is dirty. This was a very busy place and it seem to me that they were understaffed. Carry out ordering is the way to go at this place."}
{"text":"Great service coupled with reasonable pricing makes Pei Wei a good value. The spicy noodles and shrimp were great. My friend had even better Mongolian beef. 

The complimentary sushi was an unexpected surprise."}
{"text":"Wei better orange chicken yummy with noodles 
Not rice
Ahi salad so good
Pad Thai  always a winner
Service fast and no problem special
Order no cilantro"}
{"text":"Although the food was average this place was filthy. It looked as the the floors weren't cleaned for days and the tables weren't clean. What's worse was that the wait staff stepped over the dirty floors time and time again not noticing or caring it was disgusting. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Meals take forever to get to you, they're always out of all the most popular sodas, they always (ALWAYS) burn the tofu in every dish, and they always seem overwhelmed, even by light traffic.  The 7th St. and Bell location doesn't have these problems."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, Chef Eric nailed it with his Thai Basil Chicken entree.  Also love their thai coconut curry, pad thai, dan dan and kung pao.  The staff here is usually friendly and accurate, with no botched orders yet.  Sure the dining area can get loud, but I come here with co-workers all the time, and it hasn't yet drown out any of our conversations.  Fresh orange wedges for your fresh brewed iced tea."}
{"text":"Worst Pei Wei ever. Came in on a Saturday around 7 pm and the place was a disaster. Only one soda machine was working so there was a huge line to get drinks, they were out of napkins silverware etc. and it took forever to get our food. My sushi sat out on the counter for so long it was room temperature by the time I received it. When I went to the register to get a refund the employees couldn't figure out how to process the transaction and that also took forever. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This is fast, has lots of choices, and is pretty good. Better than your average Chinese take out but a little pricey for what you get. 

I had shrimp with mixed vegetables over brown rice. A TON of rice (easily 2-3 cups). I would have preferred more veggies (very little, less than a cup). A lot of shrimp though which was good. My daughter had the shrimp lo mein which was just ok. Shrimp summer rolls were tasty."}
{"text":"I wanted so much to like Pei Wei. I did. I went twice, getting different dishes both times. My mom raved about it, so I gave it a shot... and while I can't remember what I ate, I do recall bad stomach pains and not being able to get the taste out of my mouth for some time. And by some time, I mean I went here for dinner both times, didn't feel so hot after dinner... then felt awful the entire next day. I have to do my stomach a favor and not touch this food again."}
{"text":"In the last 4 month we've been her 4 times. Each time I hope to t will be better. This is not about the food but the service and condition of the facility. I've been coming here a long time, at least 10 years. To even order is challenging. They didn't have our order completed in the app the first time. The last 3 we went in to order and eat in. Wrong decision!  They have one person at the register who is never interested in getting someone to assist when the line is to the front door. (3 different cashiers)The beverage machine on the right hasn't worked correctly any of these times.  They have had to bring our equipment to remove after. It is very disgusting. Thursday evening one stall in the women's restroom wasn't working. Very sad and even more that we won't be going back."}
{"text":"If you ever crave P.F. Chang's, but would prefer to avoid the pretentiousness and cut the cost, Pei Wei is a great alternative. They serve a similar menu, many of the dishes are the exact same, but at a slight to drastic price difference. 

The atmosphere is not inferior by any means. Instead of the dark, rich colors that signifies fine dining, Pei Wei goes for a more simplistic motif. The open windows creates lighting that give this place a comfortable feel, and the plush booths add to this sentiment. The large menu board up front, leading towards the cashier, is easy to read and directs the flow of guest. Once you order, you sit down, they bring your food, and the rest is self serve. It is a more upscale version of fast food. 

My friends and I enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps. The portion is large enough to share between three. PFC- $7.95 PW-$6.95 I am not one to over stuff my lettuce, so we usually run out before the filling is gone. I have asked for extra wrappers and they have complied without making a fuss. Bonus points for a better tip. Another popular starter are their crab wontons. They are filled with bits of crab, scallions, red peppers, and cream cheese. Usually I avoid cream cheese, but am a sucker for rangoons. For an order of six you pay $4.95 compared to the $6.95.

Now for the main course. You get to choose from a variety of different styles, and the cost varies depending on your protein. Tofu and veggies run the cheapest at $7.50 and shrimp cost the most at $9.25. Orange Peel is similar to orange chicken and works well with all, but I prefer the tofu and veggies in this sauce. The Thai Coconut Curry is just as great with no meat. The green beans are the best in this ensemble. Now here is where you will see the big difference in your receipt. If you order the Orange Peel Chicken at Pei Wei, it will cost you $8.25. At P.F. Chang's, it is $13.75. With the savings from that alone you can go down the street and get a crepe from The Crepe Shack for dessert. The best part is that you get a choice between brown or white rice. You technically get a third option of fried rice, but that comes at an up-charge.

This place is great for those who want their favorite dishes, but do not have the time or money. You will also save more because you leave a tip for the busser. Cashier, as well, if they are extra helpful.

Although it is not authentic Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese food. All my favorite cuisines, by the way. Sometimes you can learn to appreciate the Americanize spin on classics."}
{"text":"It had been quite a while since going and we sometimes go to a different location,but as we walked up the first impression was THE WINDOWS ARE FILTHY! Food was just ok, there was no customer attention at all. We are not returning to this location. Manager Ryan Hendricks should be a bit more vigilant."}
{"text":"Worst location in Vegas! The servers are rude and portions are small! This place used to be great! But lately with the new cooks it's gone down hill! You ask for extra chicken which is $2 and they try to play it off like they are giving you extra but it's the same portion size. The last three times they have messes up on my order and I was promised a gift card! It never came In the mail! If you want pei wei please go to the one on sunset! It's worth the drive! The manager is sweet and their portions are so worth it! 
Avoid the one on horizon ridge."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot. The food is consistent and good, but the service really sucks. About a third of the time I call in to place a to-go order, my call isn't answered within 5 minutes. When I'm at the restaurant, they either seem to be lacking one person up front to handle expediting, taking orders, and handling to-go pickup customers. Today, my food sat at the ready counter (for pick-up) while 3 other employees were hanging out on the other side doing nothing pertaining to work with one cashier trying to handle everything up front. Poor management of resources over and over again. Regardless, I still go back because the food is decent and relatively inexpensive. I would really like to see their customer service improve."}
{"text":"We recently visited this location had a new dish kung pao chicken it was very good great service would do this again"}
{"text":"I usually have Pei Wei once a week and have not been disappointed. The service is always so pleasant and food itself is so delicious. The workers are friendly and the service is always ready for pick up as Im ready for pick up. Thank you Pei Wei in Surprise for a great experience every time I order. I will make sure I let my friends, family, and co-workers know that the staff and food at Pei Wei is not only good but obsessional. Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I waited 5 years to eat here living nearby the whole time but had a great lunch! Pei wei spicy chicken w peapods carrots and white rice lunch size with a drink for less than $10. I like that I can actually tell I'm eating white meat chicken! Very fresh and tasty but next time I will go for extra spicy option, although very flavorful the chicken was barely spicy. From what I saw at other tables, I'll be coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the last straw for Pei Wei! How many months or maybe even years of unhappy customers hurdeled in groups by the door, walking out, or demanding refunds is it going to take for you guys to realize something is wrong with your operations? Always completely under-staffed. After my online order was given to me about 40 minutes after my promised time, the guy at the counter said \"so sorry about that you're all set\" mind you I had not payed yet so I thought well that's nice he comped it. Not kidding you, I get into my car, start driving and he comes chasing me down, screaming my name to tell me I did not pay!! I pulled aside and came in to give them the last money they will ever see out of my wallet. Complete clusterf@ck! Embarrassing operation going on here. Called the restaurant to speak to a manager as I was going home and literally the phone just rang and rang for 31 minutes (yes thirty one) and still no one answered. Who is in charge of this place? Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"The new Thai River Noodles are a must try! I like the fact that Pei Wei is a less expensive version of PF Changs. Is it Americanized Asian food? Most definitely, but I still like it. The crab won-tons have real crab and are served in a very flavorful sweet and spicy sauce. The fried rice is deliciously fresh with chunks of fresh al dente veggies in it. The new Thai River noodles are my current fave. It is sort of like Pad See Ewe with chow fun noodles instead. The beer is always ice cold and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good food but such crappy service and long wait times that it's not worth it.  Too many other good Asian places to eat that it's not worth putting up with this badly managed place"}
{"text":"I always eat there and i like their food and the ice tea is amazing , but today I ordered the Thai dynamite (small) to go and it was dry, barely any vegetables and the meat looked and tasted funny like it was cooked the day before !! I threw it away. I am disappointed this time"}
{"text":"While I prefer to eat Chinese elsewhere in the valley, this quick and super casual version of PF Chang's is at least reliable for the occasional quick lunch. 

You know what you're getting. Their Asian inspired dishes are certainly nowhere near authentic, but they are tasty. I usually go for the honey seared chicken and fried rice. The small is perfect for lunch and the regular size portion will allow you to either be totally stuffed or bring home leftovers. I do like their Crab Rangoon appetizers as well. 

You order at the front and receive a number, then your food is delivered to you. Utensils, fortune cookies, napkins, etc you grab yourself at a station between the coke machines. 

The staff is always nice enough, and they have a rewards program if that's what you are into. They have a separate station for take out orders so you don't have to wait in line with the rest of the lunch or dinner crowd. Not terrible, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Cannot request level of spiciness of the pad Thai when ordering online. I wanted no spicy but it wasnt too bad anyway. I can deal w a little spice."}
{"text":"I like how Pei Wei is a family friendly place. I like that it is fast but not so fast that you can't take your time to enjoy your food. We had excellent service and the food was yummy. The manager was very visible and approachable. The staff was very aware of our needs and were quick about getting us anything we needed. It was a wonderful place to pop in when in the middle of a day of running errands."}
{"text":"I went to this Pei Wei location for the first time on Thursday and had a great experience. Cheap prices as usual, great service and it wasn't bust at all which meant my food came out very fast! My food was brought over to my table and (I was with my friend) got up to go get silverware and the girl who brought our food over to us said she'd get forks and chop sticks for us which I thought was very nice. Definitely coming back to this Pei Wei for a fast awesome tasting lunch!"}
{"text":"Super yummy and cheap food! Employees are always nice and fast at what they do. I've never eaten inside this exact location but i'm sure it's as good as eating out. I do take out usually with my family and they always give the food right away when you walk in even if you are a little early. You don't have to wait usually more than 15 minutes for your take out order to be done which makes this place awesome!"}
{"text":"It's great. They all are wearing gloves. The place is clean. The service is top notch. The staff is paying attention to guests needs...they brought us a bag for our to go food without even asking. I got the small Korean Spicy Steak and it was ALOT of food. So delicious, a little sweet but mostly spicy. The person with me got the Mongolian Beef and it was just as good. Definitely one of my favorite spots now on the west side of town. Really wish there was more locations but this one is great."}
{"text":"This location has really poor customer service. They often don't pick up the phone when I call to place a pick-up order."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Fresh food - great sauces and brown rice option! This place doesn't disappoint. Portions are pretty good and the food is hot and fresh. Prices are decent and there is variety for every palette. Thai curry is a bit too hot for my liking and they cannot alter the spice level.  Ginger broccoli is my fave paired with the brown rice. Next time I will order with less sauce or sauce on the side....at times the items are heavily sauced."}
{"text":"Pretty good portion sizes!!! Ordered Thai coconut curry and the dynamite chicken. Both ordered with brown rice....tons of rice!!! Not usually a complaint but actually it really was just too much rice.  Dishes were tasty but the Thai curry was really spicy. They did not ask a spice level so I assume this is the normal spicy, if you don't like it spicy you should say \"mild\".  They need better drink selections as far as sodas....but they do have flavored teas like chai latte."}
{"text":"This is the second pei Wei location that I have visited. The first one which I frequent often is in Newport Beach, California and the service and food quality over there is top notch. I was expecting a similar level of service and food quality but I was horribly let down. I ordered sushi and my body literally felt like I shouldn't be eating this. The sushi tasted as if it was expired and not fresh at all. A few bites in, I decided this is not for me. The server was a bit rude but that was completely overshadowed by the quality of the food. I did not even stay 10 minutes. I left my food and decided to fill my stomach at a place where the food wouldn't make me sick. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because at least the soda was good."}
{"text":"All right, this is probably due to a long weekend of gluttony in Sin City, but my meal here was light and refreshing and it hit the spot.  Looking at the other reviews online, looks like the menu is the same here as at the Terminal 1 location, though this one lacks alcohol.

There's a slight delay here as things are made to order (besides the items in the cold case).  I heard the cashier tell another customer 7 to 8 minutes.  Service was friendly, though I did have to ask for hot sauce - disposable ramekin with a garlic chili sauce that was kept behind the counter.

In any case - it was Pei Wei with a slight price premium being in the airport.  I had the spicy chicken, substituting noodles for rice ($1 up-charge, $12.55 with tax).  I had some great meals on this trip - Sushisamba, Yardbird, Momofuku, etc but was definitely looking for something a bit lighter/simpler, and fast food, Westernized Chinese at the airport fit the bill.  Chunks of breaded chicken tossed with some snow peas, broccoli, and carrots over egg noodles.  Not exactly \"spicy\", but way lighter than Panda Express, and vegetables were surprisingly crisp.  Chicken pieces were thin and not too heavily breaded.

Definitely would stop back in here if I'm ever flying out of Terminal 3 again."}
{"text":"Husbands pad Thai w chicken didn't taste like all the other PeiWei versions he/we have had. Kinda blah and what's with the peanuts on the bottom of the dish?
My Chicken Salad dish was not pre tossed w the dressing already on it like the dozens of other times I've had it. Oh also too many wontons too. 
I guess we just won't come to this location anymore. Closest to our house now but not worth the issues we had tonight. 
Oh and like I said in the tip.  10 knives to find 2 clean ones... Really?? Obviously their dish washer isn't hot enough!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant completely dead except for the one take-out customer whose order the cooks have ignored all three times the cashier has asked them to make it?  Sounds like a great time to take a break!  People really are this clueless.  Got a refund and went across the street.  Total waste of 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I don't know if they've improved their staff or their processes or both, but we haven't had a mistake in our takeout orders in probably a year.  100% success rate.  Well done on the improvement."}
{"text":"I was so surprised to see so many negative reviews! I've been in twice right around lunch time to place take out orders and pick up lunch. The staff is always super friendly and there is always someone cleaning and making sure supplies by the soda fountain is stocked. Today I discovered the $5 Mongolian Chicken Bowl. I figured since I was getting it to go that there were be an additional fee- nope! And no additional fee for the fact that I wanted brown rice. It was a pleasant surprise! I waited about 5 minutes, grabbed some extra soy sauce and was on my way. I also like that you have to grab your own utensils and sauces because I think that overall helps with unnecessary waste- for the company, and also for the planet! The less plastic waste the better. I'll probably make this a regular Monday spot. Thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"I am so upset. I ordered my usual Pad Thai tonight and it looks like they changed the recipe. They added Broccoli and Snap Peas. Who would ever put Broccoli in Pad Thai. Major Fail, Pei Wei. I'm done with ya'll"}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic. Except a girl who I believed was the manager. She was rude, and gave a lot of attitude over simple small talk. Get her to fix herself and this place would be 5*****"}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars if I could. What a sh*thole this place has become. I was here several months ago, and ordered some kind of shrimp entree, with extra shrimp and extra veg. Got it home - and NO SHRIMP. I called, and they offered me some free food the next time...which did me no good, wanting to eat what dinner I had in front of me. I refused their offer.

I told myself I'd give them one more try. 

Ordered 2 entrees and an appetizer online this morning for an 11:30am pickup. Got there at 11:28, to be told they had no broccoli or snap peas for either entrees. 

I was offered the option of mushrooms, scallions or onion. Really???

The 'kid' working my order said she just had to bag it up, and it would be ready. 

At 11:45 - 15 minutes later - I finally went back to the register and asked someone else where my order was. It was sitting in a bag, that had been sitting there pretty much the whole time. I only figured it out, because people that had come in behind me, were being given their orders.
WHO did they think the bag belonged to??? No one EVER paged my name. I was a mere 10 feet away, so I think I would have heard my named called.

Never again for this 'chain'. Do yourselves a favor and go to China Chili over on 3rd St and Osborn."}
{"text":"I usually order the pei wei spicy with tofu. I don't know why but the tofu is almost always tough. It's like chewing jerky or shoe leather.  I wish they'd get it right because I love the flavor."}
{"text":"Just got our takeout and opened it up... yikes.  As a vegetarian for 12 years who recently has decided to give in to easily available protein options, it seems as though it's just not meant to be.  The chicken strips in the chopped chicken salad I just received looks like it was steamed, put in a freezer for weeks, then thrown on the grill right before I got it.  The inside is watery and the edges are transparent.  Harris Teeter's to go salads would be a better choice.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"With all the mediocore to scathing reviews, I've always said No Way to Pei Wei. I ordered for pick up and had a very friendly, helpful, if not Jeff Spicoli sounding, employee help me with my first ever Pei Wei experience. At 9pm on a Thursday night there was plenty of parking and I found the little Pei Wei place to be 1/4 full and actually a nice looking room. The surly person (manager type) who rung up my order, must have had to much MSG as he was irritable and I must say a bit puffy. But most importantly, after devouring our take out, Rickie and I voted four thumbs up (that's two thumbs for each of us, times two, carry the one...well you get the idea) for three of the four items. So spring rolls, potstickers and Korean beef....you'll soon be hanging with us again soon. Pad Thai? Yea. You're not invited. Unless you can sauce it up a bit and find it in your heart to bring along more tofu and veggies. But I'm not counting on it. Pei Wei? Yes way for this gay! OK!?"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a very long time so when my spouse suggested it I was pretty amped because the pei Wei I remember was always tasteful and satisfying. I walked in and I saw they served sushi so I thought I'd try it. God no. It tasted worse than the frys brand with that imitation crab. I sent it back and asked for a side of chicken, the manager looked annoyed but took it back anyway. A few minutes after receiving my chicken, I dropped a drink accidentally. My fault, yes, but when I went to ask the server for a towel, he actually gave me one and made me clean the table up myself. I then went to ask for a second one because the floor was still wet, which is when another employee stepped in and starting cleaning it. I then went to ask for boxes for our food because that visit was pretty horrible. Instead of going to get my boxes, the kid that made me clean up the drink went to tell the \"manager\" I spilled a drink and she threw her hands up in the air as if the world had ended. I'm sure this isn't the first or last time someone spills a drink lady. Learn some customer service skills. So I sat there, and waited and waited and waited for my boxes. I stopped him and asked him where my boxes were, \"oh sorry I forgot.\" Maybe you wouldn't have forgotten if you weren't busy gossiping. So in conclusion, the sushi is disgusting, like I literally had to spit it out after trying to force myself to eat it and the service was horrible. The manager should rethink customer service at a restaurant with her attitude."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's little sister serves up (almost) the same food, but at value prices. 


Hankering for delicious pan-Asian cuisine in an informal setting? Pei Wei is owned by the same company as P.F. Chang's China Bistro. Pei Wei provides much of the same menu, but in an informal setting with value prices. Stand in line, place and pay for your order. Get your beverage, condiments, and fortune cookies at the self-serve bar. By the time you've settled into your table, your piping hot, freshly cooked plates of happiness will be delivered to your table. 

My favorite is the Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps, diced chicken, shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts, and scallions, served with a side of cool lettuce leaves. Yes, it's an appetizer, but it makes an awesome meal too. Another top choice is their Asian Chopped Chicken Salad. It tastes fresh and crunchy with a tangy Asian flavor. While the lettuce wraps and the chopped salad are delicious, the added bonus is they're fairly low in calories. What a great way to enjoy a lot of mouth-watering flavors without blowing your diet plan."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine since it opened as a cheaper and faster alternative to Pf. Chang's. I almost always order the Pad Thai and/or the Lettuce Wraps. Both of which are amazing. I always make I stop at Pei Wei when visiting AZ. Oh and the new Soda machine is amazing."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 2 stars solely based on my most recent visit. Normally, I get the orange peel chicken and it has always been good! Recently I've been on a tofu kick so I decided to give the tofu here a try instead of chicken. BAD CHOICE!!! The tofu came out in thin little burnt strips. I also tried the hot and sour soup which was also a disappointment."}
{"text":"Forgot i had the family coming over, needed something quick and decent price to feed 6 heads. Pei came through with a lettuce wrap with chicken and an order of \"fry rice\".  Friendly service and even threw in a couple more dipping sauces for the wraps.  As always another amazing dinner to go from Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I really wish I would have looked at the Yelp reviews prior to dining here.

Very disappointed with my experience. The person who took our order seemed as if we are bothering him and he had better things to do than help us. Went to fill up our drinks at the soda fountain and found that the single button was filthy and covered in a brown grime, not like there's a whole lot they need to clean... There's only one button. Not overly upset about that we sat down at the table. Surprise that our food arrived so quickly. I ordered the Poke bowl with brown rice and it came with white. Again not a huge deal just not thrilled with lack of customer care. About 1/4 the way through my meal I got what felt like an odd feeling in my mouth. Looking closer at the bowl I saw what I believe was it burnt onion. Upon further inspection.... it was a cockroach. 

When I brought it to the attention of the management who didn't seem really all that surprised nor did he offer solution. I actually had to ask for my money back for my meal. I contacted corporate the other receipt I received on the feedback yet haven't heard word from them.

I'm quite certain the health department needs to take a look at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a lunch combo and was disappointed with the small portion and no flavor. Way over priced and not a real friendly atmosphere, felt like I was being rushed out of the line while only 2 other people were behind me. Won't be coming back anytime soon!!"}
{"text":"On a whim, me and my wife decided to try out Pei Wei and for me it was one of the worst experiences I have had food wise at this chain. The food was less than mediocre. My meal (Honey Seared Chicken) was lukewarm and it tasted as if it had been sitting under a heating lamp for some time. The food itself lacked flavor all around. Save yourself some money and go to Tott's Asian Diner across the parking lot for much better food and better prices."}
{"text":"ehh, not good and not bad. This place is ok and if you're craving chinese and don't wanna travel to far, this place is fine. The price is not very expensive and food comes out quick. The atmosphere is cool as well. The food quality was not bad but not something to go around raving about. Overall, i would choose a different place to eat, but this isn't a bad choice"}
{"text":"Chocolate city breathtaking jawline dropping heart warming phasing out mr.peterson would wear his cheetah skins in here every flavor like starburst and color all she wanted was a Pei Wei sesame chicken the food was hotter than Shoah hot fiya goes first bbbbhhh honestly yoooo y'all keeps it hot as can be cause he lord knows"}
{"text":"The boss treated us to Pei Wei's on Friday. 

I think this is a solid place for decent and inexpensive food.  This is not the first time I experienced Pei Wei, but this particular location has consistent tasty food and friendly service.   If you order online, you will receive a 25% off.  Great deal!   Although it's not a place I would frequent, it was a welcome change and the company was great."}
{"text":"Basically, this is \"P.F. Chang's Lite\": Same sort of food (including those tasty lettuce wraps), smaller menu, and less hands on service from the waiter (meaning you make your own \"Chang Sauce\" or whatever they call it).  It also means less lines and wait time to be seated, and is cheaper than the full-on restaurant.

The food and service have been consistently good, and they have some sort of new reward card system (buy enough meals, get one free).  I was feeling a little playful today, so when the server handed me the card, I said \"This is the greatest moment of my life\", upon taking it, to which she just looked sort of confused at me, until I offered that I was just joking.  She still just stared curiously at me as she rang my meal up.  I didn't realize I had caused such a conversational faux paus.

Ironically, my post-dinner fortune read as follows: \"Others appreciate your good sense of humor today.\"  

No, no I don't think that was the case for this particular dining experience.  But at least I mixed my \"Chang Sauce\" just the way I liked it today."}
{"text":"The food was good - the place was disgusting.  The man who took our order smelled so heavily of smoke.  Then when asked if they serve wine he looked around and said \"No I don't think so\".  The bathrooms were overflowing with trash and there was food everywhere on the floor including a Q-tip which was disgusting.  It made for an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"My experience here was awesome! Everyone from the register person to the kitchen staff and manager were welcoming. The food was great as well!"}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED....first they got my order wrong...second the pot stickers were so over friend we could not finish them...what about standards? Who let that leave the kitchen? Third...Spring rolls, veggie came fried to a crisp. My bad I guess. I expected soft unfriend spring rolls which is how they should be served especially when fried egg rolls are offered as well. They were way over cooked. Somebody needs so fryer training! 
The restaurant was not busy at the time. This is just sloppy food prep.
As for the sushi...very average at best. 
1) The California mango roll...don't waste your time. The mango cannot be tasted nor seen. We did not order this but we got it and paid for it.
2) All 4 rolls were different in size. Consistency is the key to good food prep. Why the disparity of sizes?
3) The crunch rolls (2) were the best of what we got and they are on a limited basis...
We spent $37 on dinner for two and they served us cheap plastic cutlery. Very disappointed. If you are going to advertise your food as upscale your accoutrements should be as well.

Overall a very disappointing experience and I will not go back. I bought into all the hype in marketing and advertising...I would have preferred a better more professionally prepared meal.
I don't think there was anyone in the kitchen over 21 years old...high turnover? In any case better training is needed."}
{"text":"We first had Pei Wei in Miami, I was surprised to see it here, but was glad they finally made it to the valley. The food served beats anything from Panda express, the chicken is always cooked perfectly, all in all a good chinese fast food place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hot dish made on the spot I would recommend eating at this establishment. Entrees come with either brown or white rice and for an upcharge you can replace it for fried rice or noodles. I would have given them more stars but unfortunately my brown rice was extremely dry and the Mongolian beef entree didn't have enough sauce to balance out the dish."}
{"text":"Done done done with this location. They sent me away once again. We came to dine in, the place was half full, tables dirty, maybe 2 tables of people outside. We get up to register and the young lady taking orders proudly announces that it will be at least a 1/2 hour. Last trip was an online order placed a couple hours prior, we get there to pick up and were told that it would still be 1/2 hour. Let me know if you ever get your s**t together as I used to love this place."}
{"text":"First of all I really like Pei Wei. The food is always good and plenty of it for the price. I do have some issues although with this particular location in North Scottsdale. Last two times I've been there I have noticed they've fallen down on cleanliness; most tables where open although we had a hard time finding one table that was clean. After moving from table to table 3 times, we finally found one that was somewhat suitable, not totally clean but not as bad as most of the other tables. Even thou the food was still good, the lack of cleanliness at the tables makes me wonder about food handling and the kitchen as a whole! Please Pei Wei get it together, I would like to continue being a customer!!"}
{"text":"Pei wei is one of my favorite places to go to. I've been to many of them throughout the Phoenix area. I decided to write a review about this place for a couple reasons. One the food tasted very good. There have been times where I was not impress with the food. The other is because of their busser/waiter. His name was Umberto. He was AWESOME. Checked on us a couple times, got us fortune cookies without asking and to-go boxes. Also cleared the table promptly. He made what customer service used to be. He was phenomenal and if he wants to grow with the company, I think they should definitely seek him out for an opportunity."}
{"text":"I was surprise to see this place with a three star ratings. I've been here several times and yeah there have been times when the service or food were kinda bleh but for the most part it's been good. We've came a few times when Chelsea is there and every time she's there our service was great. We came close to closing time and she was still very friendly and helpful. In fact, she's the reason why I decided to give this place a five star. Way to go Chelsea!!"}
{"text":"I recommend the Wonton Soup and Vietnamese Rolls, they never seem to disappoint. The peanut sauce and sweet chili that comes with rolls is my favorite part.
Soup is a bit salty but edible.
Bon Appétit y'all!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how many stars to rate my experience at this Pei Wei yesterday. The food my boyfriend and I ordered tasted good (Kung-Pao Chicken & Coconut Curry Chicken), but there were some issues.

First off, when I go out to eat, I try to stick to drinking water. Not because I'm cheap, but because it's healthier (and the amount of Splenda I require for iced tea is pretty ridiculous). So when the order-taker girl asked if I wanted a drink, I requested just a cup for water. I was surprised when I was given a full-sized paper cup, usually it's a tiny plastic thing. Ok, well that's cool, whatever. So when my boyfriend asked for a water cup as well, she said \"No, I can't.\". I couldn't believe it! My boyfriend looked at me in disbelief as we walked off, but I was kind of tempted to make a bit of a scene. Like, \"What do you mean, 'No, I can't'? Are you telling me I have to SHARE a cup with this guy and get his cooties???\"   Lol... anyway...

So yeah, that was pretty bizarre to me, and needless to say, we had to refill our ONE water cup at least five times.

So I was maybe 1/3 of the way through my Coconut Chicken Curry and I spotted a hair. Just great. I pulled it out and inspected it. Long, thin, light brown hair, maybe  6\". I have long, dark brown (almost black) hair, so not mine, but the fact that it was completely buried in the food erased any doubts that I may have had about that. I took it and my plate up to the order-taker girl and showed her the hair. She said, \"Oh, ok.\", took the plate from me and walked off. I returned to my table, not 100% sure about what was going to be done. The manager (I'm assuming) finally came by and asked if I wanted a remake. Well, yes I did. I was also offered my money back on the meal, which was the proper way to handle this situation. I wasn't mad, it happens. My hair finds its way all over my house, so I can't really judge too hard on that. I was more annoyed with the order-taker girl and her lack of customer service skills.

So would I eat here again? Yeah, I probably would someday, if I had a coupon."}
{"text":"We were actually on our way to a Korean restaurant when all of a sudden I had a craving for Pad Thai. Maybe because it's been a while since I've had it but the feeling was like... I WANT PAD THAI NOW!!!  I then remembered about Pei Wei and how I used to dine at their Summerlin location often when I lived on that side of town. So I said to my boyfriend \"Change of plans, we're going to Pei Wei\".  This was the first time I've been to the Eastern location even though I've driven by this place numerous times.

We walked in and noticed it wasn't too busy. There were two lines - one line for dining in and the other line was for takeout orders. There were at least 3 people over in the takeout line. My boyfriend and I were the only ones in the dining in line. The gentleman who took our order was very nice and he even suggested appetizers. I got the chicken pad Thai, my boyfriend got the seared chicken with white rice, and we got an order of crab wontons as an appetizer.

We got our silverware and went to sit down when I noticed one of the forks had dried rice on it...eww.  So my boyfriend got up and got another one but didn't look at it until he got to the table and once again, this fork had dried rice stuck on it... WTH!!! Anyway, we did find one that was clean and I made sure to wipe it down some more before using it. My boyfriend ended up using chopsticks.
.
l really, really like the Pad Thai from here!  To me it was perfect... the flavor was not overwhelming and it had the right amount of spiciness. I forgot to tell them no bean spouts and it was a nice surprise to see that there was very little bean sprouts in it. This might not be a good thing, though, for someone who actually likes bean sprouts.

I was a little disappointed with the crab wonton. It was plain, flavorless and I thought it wasn't worth the price. You only get two pieces and it's $2.00. I won't be ordering that again! 

More and more people started coming in and I noticed that their takeout line got pretty busy. I think next time I will order takeout from here.

By the way, I would have given them 5 stars but had to deduct a star for their forks and wontons."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Good atmosphere.  Crab wontons and Mongolian steak are so good!  Portion size and price are on point.  I eat multiple means per day and typically large plates.  The small portions are more than enough for lunch.  Also had the wasabi crunch roll which was really good.  All the perks of PF Chang's but with a fast casual dining experience.  Order at the front and they bring your food.  No waiters/waitresses, you leave your plates on the table.  Great lunch restaurant model."}
{"text":"I'm usually a hole-in-the-wall fan when it comes to Asian food, but sometimes as a vegetarian there are limits due to fish sauce being in most dishes! This place is always my go-to when I need a quick pick me up for dinner! It's pretty clean and the service was quick.  I would go to this location again."}
{"text":"So....I got a new coworker and I asked him what he was getting for lunch one day.  He replied, \"Pei Wei\" and said that he had been there a bunch of times in the past month.  They have a killer deal on their General Tso's entree right now for only $5.00!  Can't really beat that!  All their other entrees are $8-10 or more, so for $5.00, what do you have to lose?  I decided that's what I was having for lunch.

I went online and placed my order via their website (very easy to do, very user friendly!).  I decided to go with a combo of different things.  The $5.00 entree comes with a small size, with white rice.  I decided to hook up my order and went with a combo of chicken AND shrimp, and upgraded my bowl to fried rice for an extra buck.  When all was said and done, I had a regular/large bowl for a little over $7.00.  Score!  I paid over the website and drove down to pick it up.

Pick up was easy.  Walked in, told them my name, they handed me my food, I filled my bag with utensils, napkins and a couple of fortune cookies and I was on my way.  Here is how it was..............

General Tso Entree-  First of all, this is a large sized bowl.  It had significant weight to it!  I could see a bunch of pieces of chicken/shrimp layered on top with some carrots and chiles as well as the one token piece of broccoli, lol.  This was covered in a thick, rich sauce and all layered on top of a mound of fried rice.  It was pretty tasty. Kind of like a cross between an orange chicken and a kung pao. The chicken and shrimp are coated in a batter and fried up.  I liked the shrimp better than the chicken, plus there was more of it, too.  Next time, I think I am just going with straight up shrimp, and not with split proteins.  The fried rice was good, and the veggies gave it some good texture.  The sauce was a little too sweet though, and there was a ton of it.  I might go \"light sauce\" next time, too.  I finished most of the bowl and was stuffed!

Overall, I was happy that my new coworker made the recommendation.  It was a filling lunch that tasted pretty decent.  Pair that with the fact that it was right around $7.00 (and can be less than that if you just get white rice and chicken or beef), this makes it a killer lunch deal.  The ladies at the counter were friendly, and this place is only about a 7 minute drive from work.  I may have to come back and get it again, soon!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.

I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................

Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.

Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!

Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.

Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  

Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............"}
{"text":"We went to Pei Wei, Surprise, AZ tonight hoping to get fast service and a good meal. We hadn't been to this location in a long time. Order went in smoothly but waited for our food. Asked the staff where it was and he told us our ticket was lost and it'd be right out. Two more tables that came after us were served before we complained again. Another song and dance excuse where our order went. Finally, staff watched the cooks make our order and brought it out to us. Food tasted ok. We were given 2 $10 gift cards and 2 eggs rolls (but there were 4 of us) after we finished. Seemed short staffed, dirty, not organized at all or well managed. Many people were complaining about their order and the wait. Bathrooms were flilthy. Eating area was freezing (cool AZ night). We complained and we were told heat was on (but it was blowing cold air). Definitely has gone downhill since we were there last. We have $20 to return but I doubt we will."}
{"text":"Cold soup and soggy spring rolls, and service is awful, we waited 10 minutes at the counter, with no one to help, until I aproach one of the workers, this is at 4:00 pm, only a couple of tables full, bad experience today"}
{"text":"Girl wasn't friendly and passed us off to another cashier to place carry out order.  This used to be a place we went all of the time.  After placing order I asked for a cup for water.  This girl doesn't know her food handling skills.  She placed her fingers on the inside of my cup just after she was handling money.  There was another girl who got me another glass.  I don't even know about the food yet...should I even eat it if this is what they know????

When I got home, white rice in Mongolian was inedible- hard and green beans in other disk was not fresh."}
{"text":"Foods great.  Method of ordering to go is treacherous.   Don't bother calling.  Just spend 5 minutes online.  Then drive there."}
{"text":"Kung Pao Chicken. I used to enjoy the Kung Pao Scallops. Not sure why they removed it from the menu. It is so large I have lunch for the next day. Love being able to order online and customize my families orders."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to vegetarians. I've tried it more than once just to be sure, but even with their vegetarian options I get sick every time. There is not much in terms of their \"vegetable\" choices. All starch basically. Their food could also taste a little better. Basically it's the same meal, just different sauces. 

The customer service was okay. I do appreciate how clean the place is though. They do a great job keeping the place from looking disgusting and they are one of the cleanest places I've been to for quick food. Their prices could be slightly lower for what they offer, especially since most of the meal is rice. 

The music in the place is loud and that can get tiring, but if you sit outside or in a corner it is a little better. 

I would recommend this place for people who eat meat and do not know the taste of authentic food from Thailand, China, Japan, etc. This will be the last time I go here, I'm tired of getting really sick."}
{"text":"Everyone here was really nice. I got the Thai Dynamite with steamed chicken. The flavors were good, after adding a bit of the spicy red sauce. The only problem was that the chicken was definitely undercooked. Luckily I noticed this right away so I just threw the chicken pieces into a dry fry pan and cooked them a bit longer. Not something you really want to be bothering with when you get convenience takeout. That said, I would go back, but just ask them to cook the protein longer."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pei Wei, but this location's food does not live up to the quality of other ones. The rice was mushy, the honey seared chicken was soggy and bland, the Thai dynamite chicken tasted like nothing but a hint of lime, and the crab puffs were just weird. These are all the normal things I order and always love, but not from this one."}
{"text":"Yea they've changed a few things.... I really used to like this place but the direction they are going in seems a little confused. I ordered the hot and sour soup which I did enjoy, but that's the only reason for 2 stars. The entree I ordered was steak teriyaki. The steak was overcooked and hard. The vegetables included onions, thinly sliced carrots, and spinach. I don't have a problem with any of these, except the carrots were so thin they ended up becoming a soggy clumpy mess. Larger cuts would have been better. Also I found bits of fried dough that obviously came from a different meal that was prepared in my same wok before mind. It was disgusting. All of it ended up becoming muddled and soggy. I couldn't finish it. There are plenty of decent American Chinese food and poke restaurants around for MUCH better than this. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I decided to try take out tonight.  I went in to order and was greeted by a lovely girl named Lauren.  People were waiting in line to order and be seated.  The food and flavors were delicious!  
PeiWei cookies and coffee for dessert. 

Life is Good!!!

{"text":"The dishes always come out quick and they are always prepared well. Dishes can easily be adjusted to your liking as well. Never like hunting for tables during busy lunch times, but that happens at just about any good lunch spot, so no real complaint. Having a super Coke machines is nice addition as well. How else can you get a diet cherry Fanta?"}
{"text":"This was yummy! I got the chicken chopped salad per the girls recommendation. Also the lettuce chicken wraps and hot n sour soup. The salad was fresh and fabulous, with plenty of won tons and dressing. The chicken wraps were great, and I actually had enough lettuce! It always seems at restaurants there is a lettuce shortage so I was pleasantly surprised.  I wasnt too big on the hot n sour soup, it was kinda gross, but truthfully, I'm not real huge on PF changs hot n sour either. So no harm no foul. It is close to my house and I think I will definitely be back to try some of the yummy dishes. 

Also, I walked in and ordered togo, it was so fast! :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Pei Wei and I have to say that it lived up to its expectations. When we first came in the door as saw the long line I was hesitant but the line moved quickly and we were soon seated. The food was fresh and everyone in my party loved what they ordered. I only wish that I had a Pei Wei closer to my house so I could come here more often."}
{"text":"Got some contaminated food here today.  My Kung Po Chicken had a piece of plastic in it that I found in my mouth.  The manager tells me, \"it happens\".  It's NOT Supposed to happen. He offered to make me another but who knows what would have been in it.  Called the corporate office and only got to speak to the guy that answered the phone, calls himself customer service. No management person or executive could speak to me."}
{"text":"I usually only comment on 4-5 stars because I would want to give the business a break in case I just had a fluke of a bad experience.  Was at this restaurant this past Sunday night.  From a rude unhelpful cashier to the 42 minute wait for food there was only 1 thing that deserved something more than 1 star and that was the young man who was running food. He apologized for the wait.  Crab puffs were burnt and the spicy chicken salad (have ordered this many times before) was terrible. I would not return to this pei wei"}
{"text":"This place is always a good bet for lunch or dinner.  I've had a few takeout orders messed up or overcharged over the years, but the management has always been very helpful and responsive.  I visited again today and found that their food and service have both improved a lot."}
{"text":"We have noticed how dirty this store is also.  For one thing, and this is only one, The chair backs are grimy and look like they've never been washed.  But, we like the food, so we still stop in occasionally.  Went there today and they're closed!  Sign on the door said they were having technical difficulties."}
{"text":"Still not too thrilled with this place except for the Honey Shrimp.  I have tried the Pad Thai and the spicy chicken and I've had better.  

Plus, I ordered online an hour before I up my order last time and it wasn't ready when I got there.  It was really annoying."}
{"text":"Weird that there are quite a few haters of this place. 

We had a really good meal that was actually made when you order it and have lots of customizations that would never happen correctly at 99% if other Asian food restaurants.  The difference between here and panda is not even comparable- yet the price is about the same. 

We even messed up and ordered fried shrimp rather than steamed - they were super nice and brought out seamed shrimp for no charge!

Btw both the fried and steamed shrimp are gluten free!

Great service, open kitchen so no funny business- what more do ya want?"}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei, its good when I want something fast. But the main reason for my review on here today was to say HOW AMAZING the manager was at this location. 

I came in at lunch and it was VERY busy. There was a line to the door. There were some arguments about someone stealing a seat (unhappy customer, complaining because a seat was saved and they had waited in line, wanted to be comped because of it.... so dumb if you ask me. I mean just deal with it people! Its busy!) But the manager dealt with it so professionally, and when I was next in line he did not act rushed, he was very helpful, and told me that if I did not like what I ordered to just tell him and he would get me something new. I work in the restaurant business (a much higher priced place) and this manager was awesome! Good job man!"}
{"text":"I come here once a week. Food is always good and fresh but for some reason the last few visits they have been out of ice tea. I gotta have my tea. Lol. That's the only reason for the 4 stars. Place is clean and Service is fast and friendly. Never really a wait which is nice. I'll be back. I love this place.

Edit, I haven't checked in here for awhile until today. I still love Pei Wei but this particular one that I visit on Mondays due to my work schedule as taken a few steps back. Let me explain... first he staff change recently has made a huge impact, not that they are not friendly but the vibe has changed and I here lots of complaining. The tables stay dirty longer and no one asks you how your meal is or ask for a refill. That was a nice touch before. The machines up front I think are part of the issue as well. They are always down (like today) and can't take rewards at all. I have a free entree that I'm going to lose that I wanted to use today but can't. Isn't that the point of rewards is to be able to use them and earn them. Frustrating. Still love Pei Wei but I may start to go to another location so I can at least use my rewards.

Well Congrats to this Pei Wei for not giving a crap about there customers or customer service. Lines are always long and when you finally get to the cashier it's clear why as the clerk has really no clue how to take orders, make subs or add on items. Plus forget about using your rewards here. I order the same thing every time and it gets made wrong every single time. I add extra shrimp to my steak shrimp chili ramen bowl and I never get my steak. Oh well. Too bad. Again Congrats Pei Wei you lost this customer. Peace out."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I've ever had from Pei Wei. We ordered 2 Kung pao chicken bowls and 2 pork egg rolls. The egg roll was so greasy I felt like I was drinking a shot glass full of grease.
The chicken was HORRIBLE. It was burnt and flavorless in both orders. What a disappointment! I have to say, I won't be returning to this location. They really need to up their game.  Bad dinner at an above average price."}
{"text":"I've lived right down the street from this place for so many years and have only gone here a total of 3 times - including today. My last visit was with a friend a few weeks ago and I ordered the Sesame Rice bowl with half mixed greens and half brown rice. I got a regular size which was perfect because I feel like the small would've been like a kids' meal lol.

Not sure if I was just really hungry or what but that visit made me realize how great and convenient Pei Wei is, especially since they have great selections of Chinese and Thai food that also include healthy options (a big bonus for me!). I really enjoyed the food and decided to give it another try today. For today's visit, I got the same thing as last time but felt like they put WAY too much sauce, so it was a bit too sweet for my liking. I also asked the guy if I could do the half brown rice and half mixed greens again and he said they weren't allowed to do that and I would've been charged extra - which didn't make sense to me since they allowed it last time. 

I ordered over the phone and headed over 10 minutes later and it was already ready on the counter when I went to pick it up. Hoping to try their lettuce wraps and vegetarian selections next time!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty. The soda machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time. And the bathroom is really bad. Toilet paper roll on the floor, DIRTY floor. I nearly feel off the toilet cuz the seat is very loose. And the food wasn't as flavorful as the peiwei we go to in Mesa. And we didn't get nearly as much as we have at other pei weis. The table and chairs are beat up and the floor is grungy. Over the years, The first few times we've gone to this peiwei we were good with it. The last several times over this last year or so it's really bad. We will not go there again."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service.  Clean eating environment.  Delicious, reasonably priced food.  Great kids meals.  We love Pei Wei!  It's right across from Costco so we can eat before we shop!!  The crab Rangoon is made from real crab, not imitation.  Lettuce wraps are wonderful and large enough to share."}
{"text":"First I will say that the food is delicious. This Pei Wei is by my work and the first time I went there with coworkers everyone else got their food and my food didn't come. Finally I asked what had happened to my food and the person said that they made it with chicken instead of shrimp, but they never asked me what I would like to do. They just assumed I would rather wait than eat a different protein, but it was a work lunch hour, so not the choice I would have made.

Today I needed to run an errand at lunch right by the Pei Wei. I went early so I could order and pay before the rush but wanted it ready to pick up in 20 minutes. After three people tried to delay the order, the store manage said they couldn't do it and I would just have to come back and place the order then. 

I knew it would. E too long of a line then and not enough time and I was incredulous that this was his suggestion and asked what they do when someone calls in an order and he said they can do it then. So I said that if I were calling they could do it but since I was standing in front of them, they couldn't. He agreed and said I could either call or come in later. I told him I would just go somewhere else. He seemed annoyed and reiterated that his computer wouldn't let him do it. 

If it were me, I would have taken the order and money and just told my cook line to not make that order and then in 15 minutes tell them to make it. It's not that difficult when you make customer service the priority."}
{"text":"I don't mind Pei Wei once in a while, especially if it is for take out. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and their kung pao chicken to go. I am not sure if it was the 30 minute ride home from this location that made the plates soggy and loose its flavor or if it is better just to eat it when dining there.
Unfortunately, it was just an okay take out dinner without the wow factor. I am not sure if we will be calling for take out from this location in the near future. Maybe a quick dine in lunch will do."}
{"text":"Delicious!!
Pei Wei is delicious and consistent.
My hubby and I order take out from this location a few times a month. We usually order the kung pao chicken, lettuce wraps, and chow mein. Every time we order we are happy with the quality and service from this location. 
If you are in a hurry, call your order ahead of time and it will be ready when you arrive!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a lot, but the last two times I've ate there I have felt nauseous shortly after. I went there today and it was the only thing I ate today, and my husband and I both feel sick. We won't be back. It's a shame because it was good but it seems like this location has gone downhill in the last year or so. 
 Not my main complaint but they were also out of egg rolls when we ordered and they said they no longer carry potstickers. Both of us ordered the Thai mango chicken and mine had cold parts. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the way we feel now but it might. Anyway, whole thing is a damn shame."}
{"text":"I heard that this chain of restaurants is related to the overrated P.F. Chang's. Of course, this place is a lot cheaper, especially if you order take-out. I ordered their Soba -Miso Bowl, which were buckwheat noodles with red miso sauce, spinach, shiitake mushroom, cabbage, ginger, garlic, and scallion. It was alright for Americanized Asian food. I probably would not eat here again, unless friends of mine want to. I prefer the authentic stuff. Maybe their Chinese Chicken Salad would be good?"}
{"text":"Good service good food. Starting to get used to the change in menus.  This location seems to be better than others"}
{"text":"Called to try to place a order and was put on hold for over 10 minutes until I decided to hang up. Happens every time!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Rude guy taking my order.  Many people served before me with the same meal. My friends were served and ate their entire meal. Horrible. Will not go back to this location! The one by Sunset Station has way better service. 

Spoke to management and was refunded my money and served my meal. This is why they received two stars.

Lots of kids crying here too."}
{"text":"A cross between PF CHANGS and that panda place, Pei Wei is PF Chang's casual dining. With many of the same or similar items including those awesome lettuce wraps, Pei Wei is perfect for those who want the PF Changs feel at a much lower price.  The portions are similarly sized and they have the trademark mustard and spicy red sauce for mixing.  The menu is a bit more limited and most of the more creative dishes are left off the menu but the food is good and the service was quick.

I would like it a little better if the seating was more comfortable.  Also, only some of the tables had napkins.  Further, you have to get your own silverware which always creeps me out a bit as I don't know who touched them before I did.  So I opted for the wrapped chop sticks :)"}
{"text":"delicious fresh place thats quick"}
{"text":"They no longer have Chicken Lo Mein which was always my favorite. Very unhappy with their \"new menu\"!"}
{"text":"If you go Veggie, pick a dish where the Tofu is fried in the wok, not steamed. So much better."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for an early dinner (4:00pm)  on a Friday.  We ordered their special and lettuce wraps.  It was such a nice day we elected to eat outside.  After fifteen minutes we received our lettuce wraps but no plates. We had to find them ourselves.  Then just as made one lettuce wrap our food came out.  So now one or the other is getting cold.  But that didnt matter because they were both Cold anyway .  Then there was food from a previous customer on a table with napkins on the ground.  I had to keep shooing the birds away.  My wife went to get a spoon for her rice and her first spoon had caked on food.  Finally they cleared the table and napkins from the ground.  BUT the next table had napkins and straw wrappers on the ground and she walked by without a thought and the mess remained throughout our dinner.  It's a restaurant!   Good hot food and cleanliness are basic.  Not one of our best experiences dining out."}
{"text":"My whole family likes it!  I'm not a fan of their pad Thai, but anything with their Teriyaki sauce is awesome.  I like getting Teriyaki tofu with vegetables over brown rice.  My husband gets the teriyaki stake with vegetables over white rice, which I thought was yummy too.  My kids like their kids meals, but I have them add veggies.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"So disappointing.  I do not know what happened to this place... it has progressively gotten worse over time.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef with brown rice-- my very favorite and it didn't taste very good.  It was okay- but just not as good as usual.

The 2 star is for my dish and the zero stars are for my fiance's soppy noodle mess called Chicken lo mein--- ewwwwwwwwww!  I think Ramen noodles tasted better and cost only 11 cents.  They were so mooshy that they barely could stay on the fork-- really gross.  They were tasteless.  We threw it out.  


Pei Wei-- I miss the good times."}
{"text":"I've been there twice since New Year's Eve and both times our food took 40 to 45 minutes to serve. And that is with us asking the server multiple times where our food was. Unfortunately it appears as though Pei Wei has changed over to a shift lead in charge of the store instead of an actual salaried manager. Very penny-wise and pound-foolish. Used to be a pride associated with this company in working there and serving high quality food. Now it appears as though that doesn't exist anymore. Their General Tsao's and lettuce wraps despite taking so long to serve came out cold as if they were being held and there was a delay between cooking them and serving them. Sorry State of Affairs for a company that used to be so good. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a stand in line, order and they bring to your table restaurant. There is a large Chinese style menu selection with standard fair. I've eaten here many times. I had fast service and a hot delicious meals."}
{"text":"I have to say Amazing service and staff! It's the cleanest and freshest Pei Wei I've ever been to. AJ Farish the manager, I only know his first and last name because he has introduced himself and helped me with some past Pei Wei orders. They are great for company  lunches!!!!!! I personally love the Pei Wei spicy chicken salad but, make sure to ask for the snap peas to be crispy! You will thank me! Also the honey seared is really good! I'm not a fan of the soups but randomly a fan of the sushi and by that I mean the wasabi crunch roll! I will continue to order take out weekly from this place because of the excellent food and service! Also please note kid meals are huge! So if you are dieting they are a perfect size! Also, brown rice here is really good. Make sure to sign up for Pei Wei rewards! You get a free meal for ever x amount of points but they also send you some bogo emails!"}
{"text":"The first few times I ate at this Pei Wei restaurant, I almost certainly would have given it five stars. But the more I eat there, the more little annoyances I find. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the better lunch spots among the limited offerings in Chandler's Ocotillo area, but it has room for improvement.

My most recent experience at this Pei Wei was the worst. It must have been training day because hardly anyone who worked there seemed to know what he or she was doing. The young gentleman behind the cash register, who was friendly and trying his best, acted as if he had been given no training at all. I felt sorry for him.

Every time I eat at this restaurant, I order exactly the same meal, which makes it easier to compare my experiences. My order consists of the small rice bowl with brown rice, vegetables and tofu on top, and ginger broccoli sauce on the side. I also order a large fountain drink. This is one of the healthier meals on the menu. My wife also orders close to the same thing every time. This time she ordered a lo mein dish, also with a fountain drink.

Normally, our bill is around $19.00. The last time we visited, the cashier creatively interpreted my order, and the bill came out to nearly $26.00. The restaurant was busy, and I didn't want to hold up the line, so I let it slide. But I was curious about what actually would arrive at our table.

Let's say it was interesting. Unlike usual, the rice and tofu/vegetable combination were separate dishes. The tofu and vegetables were smothered with ginger broccoli sauce, even though I had ordered it on the side to control portion size. There may have been a misunderstanding over the meaning of \"on the side,\" but this was the first time they got it wrong. Also, the waiter tried to give my wife an extra side of vegetables with her dish, which we hadn't ordered. She refused them, although we discovered later that we had been charged for them. We still haven't been able to figure out how that happened.

If you are on a diet, I would strongly suggest that you check the nutrition information on Pei Wei's website. Most of the dishes look healthy, but you might be surprised to see how many calories they have. Don't even think of ordering a large anything. Even a small rice dish is more food than I would like. One of their small rice dishes alone can top 1,000 calories. Seriously, you might be better off going to McDonald's. The meal I normally order has one of the lowest calorie counts of any of their rice dishes, but still it is nearly 700 calories. For rice dishes, your choice of sauce is what makes the difference.

The ambience and layout of the restaurant leave much to be desired. Over the lunch hour, it is loud. Very loud. So loud it is hard to carry on a conversation. The narrow aisles and fast-moving waiters ensure that you are bound to collide with at least a half dozen people on the way to your table.

The soda fountain area is the worst place to be. I give Pei Wei points for having two of those new Coke machines with more than 100 drink choices. But the machines should come with instruction manuals because most customers stare at them with a befuddled look for five minutes before making their selections. Meanwhile, the line of would-be soda drinkers continues to grow to the point that they must constantly dance around to avoid being run over by servers racing from the grill or customers trying to get to the condiments on the other side of the line. The fortune cookies, strangely, are in a large bowl mounted high near the center rear of the seating area, away from everything else except a few diners who are trying to eat.

If you need to go to the restroom, try to take care of it before you arrive at Pei Wei. Even though the restaurant is packed over the noon hour, it has only individual men's and women's restrooms, which are almost always locked. For a few years, I assumed that the restaurant manager was a sadistic person who kept the restrooms permanently locked strictly to torture people. Then one time I actually was able to get in. I can speak only for the men's restroom, but it is large enough that it could be remodeled so that it has one or two stalls and a urinal. This would make it possible to leave the door unlocked, enabling more people to use the restroom and greatly enhancing the quality of their customer experience.

Why is this restaurant so popular? Part of it is the Pei Wei cachet. Part of it is the food, which is delicious and perceived by many to be healthy. Part of it is the fast service and friendliness of the staff. Part of it is the location, which is both convenient and lacking in competition.

I will continue to go there. But I think I will take a break for a while."}
{"text":"This was our first ever visit to Pei Wei. It wasn't bad, but it didn't wow us. I think for what you get it was kind of expensive. We all shared the lettuce wraps which were great. I had the coconut curry and it seemed pretty bland plus the chicken had hard pieces in it which was gross. Bottom line for me if I am going to spend that much I would rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Another fast casual restaurant. Like Panda Express but fancier inside. Food is pretty comparable though. Good size portion and everything is freshly made. Food wasn't great but decent. A little heavy on the sauce and onion for my taste. Kids portions are plentiful. We might try again now that we now how to order."}
{"text":"Went with my family and really enjoyed myself. The place is really nice looking and clean. The food was also very good, my favorite was the Spicy Tuna Rolls."}
{"text":"We do business with Pei Wei from time to time, most times opting for either a take-out dinner, or dining inside for lunch. Yesterday was our turn for the take-out dinner.... 

In terms of the overall food quality, I've found the individual dishes have greater consistency when you order and dine inside the restaurant, and they have greater inconsistency when you order take-out.  Still, there are times when I don't want to dine-in at Pei Wei, so this is when I turn to my 'Plan B' approach for placing the take-out order.   Normally I prefer the Kung Pao Chicken when it's prepared correctly, but I also find it's one of the most inconsistent dishes on the menu in terms of preparation.  For this reason, I mostly order the Thai Dynamite in its place.  I don't like the Thai Dynamite as well, but I know from experience the preparation of this dish is more consistent over time, which is preferred.    

For a fast food chain, the dining area is pretty well maintained throughout the day, the restaurant is clean, and there's also a fairly nice aesthetic to the place.  In any event, whether you dine in or carry out, you can't really complain too much when you consider the price point and overall food quality even with the consistency issues.  Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Finding out Pei Wei was related to PF Changs, which I have always been a fan, I wanted to check it out. I was in the area @ 11:00, right at opening & decided on an early drop in. Being that I wasn't too hungry, I decided to give a few appetizers a try. I ordered the wonton soup, pork egg roll, and crab ran goons. All were fabulous, but the pork egg roll was my favorite. Steaming hot, with a great filling of ground pork, scallions, carrots, and a few others things, served w/ a hot mustard sauce, amazing. The soup was warm and had three great wontons. As for the crab, filled and served w/ a chili sauce. Another thing to point out, the service was great. I look forward to returning, for another egg roll & an entree this time."}
{"text":"The _Sliding Scale of Value_ comes into play here.

\"Confucious say: He who eat at chain store often Pei Wei too much.\" ***

Sure the ingredients are fresher but if the pei wei chicken has the exact same flavor profile as the orange chicken at Panda, why pay twice as much?

What looks like a lot of variety, really isn't.  I felt that they could do a little more with veggies, I mean, almost every dish has snow peas and carrot disks and green onion/scallion.  Not very creative at all.

The digs provide a nice atmosphere, and bussers were keeping the lunch rush mess in check, mostly.  I have a problem with their method of putting a stack of small plates and napkins on all the empty tables.  It only seems nice and convenient to have if you want to grab and use them, but they don't clear the unused away when bussing, so who's to say the previous diners at that table didn't touch or sneeze all over them.  
GROSS! and maybe even a health violation, or at least it should be, in my eyes.

I'll go back and try other dishes, but only when I'm sick of everything else near by.  Pink Pepper is right across the parking lot, after all.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/pink-pepper-thai-cuisine-phoenix#hrid:yZp_H0z-Te_Ry9PgfPLY9A

***If you like Pei Wei, but would prefer to patronize a locally owned, independent, surprisingly similar equivalent to this popular chain, checking out Moto Sushi is a MUST.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/moto-sushi-phoenix#hrid:MeS_qbooFUkIfp_W3wccaQ    The owner once had custom fortune cookies printed up, and one of them said, \"Confucious say: He who eat at chain store often Pei Wei too much.\""}
{"text":"I find they offer solid Asian cuisine at a reasonable price.  I love the fact that I can place the order over the phone and then pick it up when it's ready.  I usually get the Chicken Lo Mein along with Lettuce Wraps or their Crab Wantons.  It's like a fast food version of PF Changs.  If you are in the mood for Chinese food, you could do significantly worse than stopping at Pei Wei."}
{"text":"The best bang for your buck if you're looking for really good Asian food but you're not trying to spend a lot of time.  PF  Changs owns this place so it's basically the same food and everything is made fresh to order.  I always get the mongolian chicken and substitute the rice for egg noodles....the best!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the containers it comes in. We eat there sometimes and also carry out. My favorite is ginger beef broccoli! Thank you for the emails especially. I really appreciate it"}
{"text":"You know what to expect when coming to Pei Wei, if not, don't bother to write a review.  One of the most consistent fast casual restaurants out there from my experience."}
{"text":"It's ok food and over priced. Is rather go to Panda Express. Try AJK Chinese Cuisine not to far from here."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. I either order Thai Dynamite or Kung Pao chicken. Delicious!! I will recommend this place to anyone. Customer service is number 1!"}
{"text":"I think I finally found something I like here. Many of the dishes offer too much rice and no chicken.  The Phad Thai is loaded with chicken and is very flavorful and spicy.  I also love the soda machines they have here with the endless combinations.  Careful though, that Phad Thai might seem healthy but it's actually about 1500 calories.  Maybe split it with someone."}
{"text":"The BF picked up Pei Wei for dinner tonight (I have a cold and he wanted to get me some soup :-) ). We also have a bunch of gift cards to pf changs, which neither of us really likes so much, so we used one here. So we ordered online, which is a neat feature. I like how when you order online it allows you to pick and choose what ingredients you don't want and extras you might want. So anyway, when the BF got to the restaurant he paid and then was told it would just be a minute. He waited ten minutes and then asked how long it would be. The person working there said that our food was sitting on the counter, they were just waiting for the soup. So that was pretty bad, all the food was just sitting out for 15 minutes, the BF asked for them to remake the food and was given attitude. Eventually, they did remake the food. If they knew they didn't have soup, why would they box up all the rest of the food? It doesn't make sense. 

As for the taste of the food, it was mediocre. We got a couple potstickers, wonton soup, orange chicken, and dandan noodles. The potstickers are weird, less noodle, more like fried bread around the meat. Not so good. The wonton soup was pretty good, definitely the best thing we ordered. The orange chicken was alright and so were the dandan noodles. Everything was really salty... the pf chang way I guess. SO I would have to say that if i was going to eat pf changs, this is a nice, cheaper option, and the food is close to the same."}
{"text":"So, Pei Wei is still what it is.... fast food. That being said, I liked this location a lot better than the Guadalupe location. The BF got a gift card for PF chang's, so we decided to get pei wei tonight, as it is cheaper and PF chang's is not so great.... Anyway, I ordered the Chili Ramen and it was one of the better things I have gotten at pei wei. I ordered it extra spicy and it was spicy.... not crazy hot, but it had a little kick. The BF and I shared the potstickers and they were fried to crap.... not my fave. Overall, it was fine, not great, but not bad, which is a plus for this chain."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Pei Wei. Food is very good and pretty reasonably priced. Not the. Eat Asian food ever, but very good - especially for the price and convenience. Selection was wonderful. Service excellent. Atmosphere nicely convenient upscale. GO!"}
{"text":"I dig Pei Wei for the ability to customize my order and be as healthy or indulgent as my heart desires. I love their Poke' Salad Bowl. Full of crispy crunchy creamy salty and spicy treats. You chomp for days. This location is the cleanest of all the locations too. My hubby always opts for the Kung Pao Chicken   Love their Rewards Program and email specials."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight from this location, ordered 4 meals one of which was the Asian Chicken Chopped Salad. I walked back to my car to leave but noticed the salad looked like it was missing the chicken, so I walked back in. A very friendly guy behind the take out counter explained to me nicely that there was chicken but it just blends in, which was good enough for me... but then he says 'lemme get you some extra poached chicken to go with it'. Handed me a little side container of extra chicken for the salad and said if I didn't notice the chicken he had to fix that for me! Such a great example of excellent customer service! Thanks for going above and beyond Pei Wei, I love ya."}
{"text":"I came to this location at 8pm and after 10 minutes of thinking about what I wanted to eat, I got to the cashier she told me that the ran out of Sushi so I had to change my mind I was going to get Crispy Potstickers as a second option and once again the lady told me that they ran out of them too
I don't think it's good for this restaurant to not have the most common things to eat"}
{"text":"Pei Wei on Sunset is a quick-service type Restaraunt that now serves a limited amount of sushi rolls. I ordered the Thai wonton soup, the mango sushi roll, and some Mongolian chicken. 

The Thai wonton soup is always good, full of flavor, and the dumplings are quite tasty. The mango sushi roll left little to be desired. It did not taste fresh, and the soy sauce-mix (maybe citrus soy sauce?) was a little like the mystery meat for lunch on Wednesdays in elementary school. The Mongolian chicken was good though.

All in all - three stars. Not the best, but not too bad. The service was polite and quick, and they offered to get us extra plates even though they were in an area where I could have easily retrieved them."}
{"text":"Not impressed.

Rude woman taking my to go order. I say \"hi there - I'd like -\" and I am interrupted with an abrupt \"for here or to go?\" No hello, no thank you, no come again. No personality. Just fired questions at me. This was not a busy time, for the record.

Filthy floors. Food, trash and napkins all over.

Egg roll was so amazingly greasy I took a photo and dumped it in the trash. I have never seen anything that weighted down with oil. It actually broke in half.

Low mein was unremarkable. Sort of bland and extremely light on the chicken. Maybe 4 or 5 small pieces.

I'll give this place one more try because previously I had a coworker pick up pad Thai for me it was quite tasty, but they need to step a lot of things up a notch here. Hope they pull it together. 

And how hard is it to be pleasant to your customers? Sheesh!"}
{"text":"Now, I love Pei Wei, and the older Asian man that took my order was very helpful and gave me a frequent buyer card. The service was excellent and the guy seemed really on top of things.

For $9.75, I'm expecting more than about 8-10 chicken nubs in my Thai Spicy with Chicken, no rice, extra veggies (subbing veggies is $1 extra at all Pei Weis) 

My sister ended up getting a small plate of egg rolls for about $6... it came with 2 egg rolls, which is a ripoff - $3 would be a more acceptable price for that dish.

After we went out to eat, we went home for dinner, if that tells you how satiated we were after our meal. The food was good, but for that price, I shouldn't have to have dinner twice. I think the bowls are a much better deal, which I'd get next time."}
{"text":"This location makes me understand why people prefer Panda over Pei Wei. I'm not sure why but they always mess up my order. I do not recommend this location"}
{"text":"This place was awful.....The broccoli was dried out and hard...The sauce tasted like they opened up a can....The brown rice was tasteless...... it tastes NOTHING like PF Chang's!   And it's somewhat pricey for the quality that you get!"}
{"text":"I like Pei Wei but this location definitely isn't the best. The first time I was here it was extremely crowded and the service was slow. It was like an unruly daycare with kids running around and no management. They also did not get the food order right and we didn't want to waste time in line to have it changed. 

 I could of just had a bad experience that time so I gave it another shot. My girlfriend and I ordered for pick-up. When we got there the food was ready but the girl at the checkout was in no hurry. When we did pay she sarcastically commented on how much food we had ordered being it was just the two of us. We had ordered a half size dish each and a four piece sushi. I would hardly say that was so much for two people, even so, they need to watch what they say to their customers. 

Sadly, I would consider the staff here need to become a little more familiar with customer service and for management to not hire all highschoolish mentality workers."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tangy spicy fresh taste. You can tell this is quality , not routine Chinese more of a fresh contemporary twist lots of nutritious ingredients. One word - quality! And also reasonably priced ! I like the fact that you order pick up and sit down (cafe style, not sit down restaurant) but still very cozy interior"}
{"text":"Ok, we know it.... It's Pei Wei. I don't expect a lot. But it's not that bad. But, \"We usually have hot Mustard, but not today\" is something a server in an Asian restaurant should say...Never."}
{"text":"So I tried placing an order via phone for pickup for over 15 mins and whoever was in charge of that proceeded to pick up the phone and hang up immediately then when I called again they picked up the phone and didn't say anything....just left it like that. At that point, I decided to just order when I got there. I get there and they are not busy. I wait for a while and make eye contact with other employees and nobody acknowledges that there are customers. Finally I say something and someone begrudgingly goes to the back to find the young lady to take my order.


Like......what, really?"}
{"text":"Why did you get rid of the orange peel chicken? The new orange chicken is in no way a substitute!"}
{"text":"I concur with other reviews in that Pei Wei is overhyped... It's not bad, but it's definitely nothing to write home about. I had the Japanese ramen plate on my most recent visit and it satisfied my hunger, but I would definitely not be inclined to order it again if return. I suppose the appeal of this place to many could be that it is simply accessible in the sense that it's a comfortable establishment and not one that you might be hesitant about entering. So go ahead, try it out and then go find some good Asian food the next time you're in the mood."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei but this location is terrible! Incredibly inconsistent with the food quality. I have had raw chicken served with my Mongolian beef (what?!) and when we asked for a new plate, it was simply replaced without any apology or rush. Manager is always on the food line and I have never seen him come out to address issues or make table visits. Drink station is rarely stocked, I had to wait for clean forks while my food sat in front of me because they were so behind. (Chopsticks were empty too. Basic.) We have tried and tried and tried to give the benefit of the doubt because we love the food at other locations but after our fourth terrible experience, we are done with Arrowhead. Get it together Pei Wei Arrowhead!"}
{"text":"Terrible service by Jamie in togo after being left on hold for 17 minutes...stated that the manager on duty had gone home at 7pm after I asked to speak to a manager.  She then proceeded to go get someone in charge.  Jamie is hurting your business."}
{"text":"Very clean, friendly environment. My family and I really enjoyed this location and the rest of Summerlin. Staff was extremely helpful."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is OKAY. But for the price IT WAS NOT WORTH IT!!! I will never go here again and would rather choose Chen wok. What a rip off!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I went by here a couple times but I never been inside and then I read the reviews and it said if you like PF change you would like this place and PF change is okay but you have to really know what to order.. So I pretty much read the reviews  and then I decided on getting something else I didn't even go to his place but then yesterday I was like let me just go and just see for myself  \"OMG\" I am so glad I went the food is so fresh!! Way better than Panda Express and the fried rice is so good I will be back this was a good place a good choice try it out if you like panda express you would love this place!! Fresh food order it and they will cook it The food is not sit in trays this to be warmed up by water and heat this food is prepared and fresh!!"}
{"text":"Our family really enjoys Pei Wei's diverse menu. At times things we order can be made inconsistently but the restaurant manager has always done their best to make it right. We order the food most of the time to go and eat it at home as we live less than 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite go to lunch spot!
NEED I say more! The place is always full of smiling guest and staff! The Ambience and atmosphere although is joyful. I've been here a few times and i can't say I ever seen an out of order or dirty establishment. If you go the this location you won't receive bad customer service or cold food. I'd recommend this place to anyone check out the pics. Mouthwatering!

Get a bowl with shrimp or soy base protein you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Once again, I had a terrible experience at this Pei Wei. This time, I ordered a vegetable Spring Roll and Ginger Broccoli Chicken with extra chicken and no scallions using the mobile app at 8:29 PM. Upon arriving I was greeted and told they were waiting on my spring roll. It was ready, they put it in the bag and I was on my way. When I arrived home, I found they gave me an order of Mongolian Steak with noodles that had been ordered by someone else at 4:29 PM. By this time, it was 8:55 and the restaurant was closing in five minutes, so I called and requested a refund as well as the name and telephone number of the regional and district managers. The person in charge was very nice, explained that she could not locate their names and numbers but did refund my money. Because I paid cash, I need to stop by the following day and pick it up. I have submitted a complaint to their corporate office, but the last time I complained (about leaving the store after 45 minutes of standing in a crowd of other people without being acknowledged, let alone served) I did not receive a reply, so I am not holding out much hope for an answer.

My advice: avoid this place like the plague it is."}
{"text":"Found this the other night.  It is the PF Chang fast food option and it worked perfectly for us.  Limited menu, but lower prices. Very basic decor, but clean and fast seating.  Lettuce Wraps just as good as Chang's.  Very busy, especially the take out.  Glad to have it close"}
{"text":"Super clean restaurant and friendly staff. FRESH food. Hasn't been sitting under heat lamps. NO MSG, this is the good stuff. I have to have the Kung Pao Chicken weekly."}
{"text":"I don't get the appeal. This food is super greasy and you can do soooo much better at any other local Chinese place. I'll only go back if I'm outvoted again."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell the difference between the orange and the Kung Pau Chicken. The fried rice was mushy.

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stacey at this location epitomizes great customer service! The food is delicious, restaurant is clean, and positive attitudes are apparent from the moment you walk in. We get take out about once a week and always love our food. Every experience at Pei Wei in Gainey is excellent!"}
{"text":"Horribly slow service. Every online order isn't ready on time. 
You can never reach them when you call. Total disappointment and lack of customer service training.  I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Great! Had to wait for pick up and got a free green tea. Thank you so much, Myra. You are sooooo awesome! Everyone is so good looking and kind here. Good going."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointd. Deliscious entreys! Great place fo take out or eat in. Heat up leftovers the next day. Yummy"}
{"text":"Getting the sauces substituted is always a game of chance.   Will just stop going can't eat my salads half the time.  This isn't the only location that has done it no matter how hard I break it down it's a fifty fifty shot I will not be eating."}
{"text":"I gave this one star because the lettuce wraps were good and the two people we were with ate all their food.  My food was completely inedible.  I had the Thai Chicken Noodles.  The noodles were like chewing rubber bands.  I could only manage to chew a few bites.  There was very little chicken, mostly tofu.  Hardly any scrambled egg.  Anyway, it was just horrible and I left the whole plate full.  My husband had noodles and paid for extra steak.  The meat was like rubber and could hardly be cut let alone chewed.  I guess we should have complained, but we just left instead and will NEVER come back.  The service was just so so since our friends order was screwed up.  Too bad because I've eaten at other Pei Wei places and liked them."}
{"text":"Okay, I do Pei Wei a lot and this store is BY FAR the cleanest. Nevertheless their hang time on cleaning dirty tables is terrible which seems to be their corporate culture as that has been my experience at the all the other stores. Hire one more person guys. The food was on par with the others (when they're on their game). Staff was friendly and competent. Get the dining room clean so we can sit at a table without having to deal with the leftovers of others and you'll get that 5th star."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot and my one complaint is that it is totally inconsistent from visit to visit. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's s#it. I attribute the inconsistency mostly to the kitchen because it's the food that is different from time to time although this last visit was not really their fault. On the days they get it right it's an easy four star and maybe even a five star review. This time my food took almost 30 minutes and it was only because I got up from my table and walked up to the kitchen counter to get my food myself that I got it at all. I asked the person at the counter how long it had been sitting there and they said I don't know. They offered to remake it but I didn't have time. I wish I had let them because it was old and the meat was really tough. 

If they do it right the Mongolian Beef which is what I usually get is amazing.This time and a few others not so much. Often tough, premade and reheated tasting and on one occasion the sauce was totally different (watered down).  

When it's right the meat is tender and the sauce is bomb."}
{"text":"\"Hi, may I take your order?\"
blah blah blah I order
Then, I feel like they should have said:
\"Would you like some food to go with that sodium?\"
Gross.  Couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"The service is so slow and the waitress/servers are out in left field. My daughter and I got our food and 20 minutes later our son FINALLY got his. The salad was soggy .. I do not recommend this location. We love Pei Wei.. but not here!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I frequently would go here because it is on our neighborhood. 

We would go here frequently, because it was convenient, but quality control has gone way down hill over the last year.  

This is my third time in the last few months been disappointed.  First issue was getting our meal home and having our chicken and veggies being under cooked.  The next time we went, got home and opened our meals it looked as if someone already ate half of our food.  There was less than half of the normal amount of food.  Tonight I ordered Orange Steak with extra steak and fried rice, and Thai Dynamite Chicken with fried rice.  Get home and have my Dynamite Chicken and Orange CHICKEN.  

Three strikes, I think it is time to find another quick pick up place."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a go to spot for consistent and delicious Chinese (and now sushi too). It's very similar to PF Changs - think lettuce wraps. Yet great prices and no waiter service (though they do bring the food out to you initially). 

The decor at this location is very tasteful and modern. Love the wood beams along the ceiling!  This location usually has a number of families and kids... Par for the Ballantyne location. 

Parking lot looks small but I've always found a spot pretty easily. There is a dedicated spot for take out parking right up front. Note that the entrance off Ballantyne Commons has changed recently as they have added a median. 

Definitely recommend to hit this place up for a nice sit down meal or takeout!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location that just opened up. Upon walking in, you can tell this restaurant is new as it is oh so clean. The decor is awesome and the atmosphere is great! Above the registers the menu is projected on large, easy to read screens. 

As for the food, I ordered the broccoli & ginger tofu w/ brown rice. I couldn't believe how delicious it was. It was the perfect sized portion and left me satisfied. Bravo to the chefs at this location! 

The place was immaculate!"}
{"text":"This place has the best spring rolls! Their food is always delicious and their staff is delightful. The inside dining area is always very clean as is the restroom ."}
{"text":"Food is going down hill. Teriyaki chicken is now breaded and very processed. No bueno !!!  It used to be real chicken and no breading. Breading is just a way to hide the low quality meat inside. You turned down the cheap road Pei Wei. So sad."}
{"text":"I came here after a day of running around town, and suddenly realized I was STARVING! A friend and I ordered the egg rolls, and crab wontons. I love the wontons. Those babies were stuffed mainly cream cheese but u could really taste all the ingredients. I had the Mongolian beef, which was good, but left me grabbing bottles of water all day/night! My friend ordered the Thai dynamite, which I really like!! It didn't seem as salty to me, and tasted soo good with chicken. I had a box full  of Mongolian to take home which I'll douse with more Sriracha + habanero's tomorrow! They have an email club with awesome offers, + fast friendly service. P.F. For sit down(relax)  , pei Wei for fast food asian. See u soon pei Wei!"}
{"text":"It was my first time ever going and I really liked the atmosphere, and the staff was really nice! I got chicken chow mein and edamame and it was surprisingly good! Reminded me of P.F. Changs (yes, I know they are owned by them as well) it was all the taste for half the cost! Works for me!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at the low rating of this Pei Wei. How can a Pei Wei be a fail?  Don't get me wrong, I'm always trying to find a more authentic Chinese food place that is good but that has proven very difficult as most places I try are either bland or use poor quality meat. With Pei Wei, you know you're getting quality and flavor every time. It's pretty delicious and consistent which is nice when you're not in the mood to gamble on how good your lunch is going to be.  To me, this Pei Wei was just as good as the rest.

I do wish it was a dollar or two cheaper... Even just offering a cheaper soda combo deal during lunch hour would make me pretty happy."}
{"text":"Must start with this... I always order take out, never eat in.  That said, they are great.  The online ordering is perfect.  I can place an order on my way out of work from my phone and pick it up on my way home.  Love that!  I am disappointed that they got rid of the green beans dish.  That was my favorite (please bring it back!).  This last time, I tried the edamame as a substitute and it was pretty good and really reasonably priced.  Still, bring back the delicious green beans!"}
{"text":"This is the first review of a restaurant in our new HOOD! Just moved to Chandler from the old QC! Man it's great to be back in civilization! The hubby is working tonight so - what the heck time to keep the pans in the boxes we moved them in and off to Pei Wei! I ordered the Dan Dan noodles, it was very tasty! I ordered the Kung Pao for the hubby - all I can say is that my mouth is watering as I sit here and look at it. He's worked hard all day - wouldn't be right to nick a bite.! Ha! I walked in and went straight to the take out desk - which I appreciate. They took my order promptly and in 10 min my order was done! That's pretty darn fast! 

I've eaten here a couple of times and well it's good! I agree with Lynn, the food is always consistent - who can complain with that! 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"It was the first time we had tried this restaurant and we had take out but I just didn't enjoy the food. It was a bland mishmash that was very different from typical chinese type food I had had. There was some hot spice taste at the same time. Maybe just me. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a mess! Every table is filthy, the silverware is gross. The soda machine has nothing but regular coke, and the tea dispensers are empty. They said it would be a 20 minute wait for food, which is okay except there is hardly anyone here.
Now I have my food. I ordered teriyaki chicken and it tastes like it was made with powder, the rice is crunchy and it is so dry. I am so dissapointed, I brought someone here to try it for the 1st time, and he is not impressed.
I won't be back to this location.
By the way it's a month later and nobody has done anything.... and it is still gross."}
{"text":"This location needs to really clean their restaurant. Past couple times I've been here it's been really dirty. Food all over. Tables not cleaned. They don't even bring out or offer plates with lettuce wraps. Service has really gone down here and they are not even busy."}
{"text":"There's some Pei Wei hating going on here, but I think I like their food better than PF Chang's. It's definitely less salty if nothing else! I got the lettuce chicken wraps, the PW Spicy chicken and the beef green curry with brown rice. Everything was good---just like you would get at an above average chain restaurant. I got the take out, and the hostess was really polite--she took the time to ask if I wanted condiments or utensils. I am mentioning that because it happened to be 31st Dec night, and the place was pretty packed. I actually quite liked the beef green curry! Think I'll add this place to my list of go-to restaurants for when I am craving Chinese fast food, and don't want to shell out $$ for PF Chang-like fare."}
{"text":"The food is always good, however it seems no matter what time you come, they are always backed up, with the dining room and even with pick up orders. You place an order, go at your set pick up time and you're still waiting an additional 30+ minutes."}
{"text":"Stopped here while waiting for my flight out of the C Gates and not having anything to eat all day generally means it wouldn't have taken much to satisfy me.

Went up to the counter and the girl working there was clearly miserable. She definitely didn't look too pleased to take my order. I proceeded to make her more miserable by placing my order. 

I ordered the Spicy Chicken. The dish came out fairly quickly (around 5 minutes). While it was edible, it wasn't good at all. Even though they prepare all their dishes to order, the food wasn't hot (temperature nor spiciness). The green beans tasted raw and seemed like they just threw it in at the last second. The rice was okay, however.

After I finished, I went left my plate there. Twenty minutes later, it was still there all the while I see the staff just chatting it up back there. No sense of urgency nor pride in their jobs. Not going back."}
{"text":"Oh Pei Wei...how I DO love thee?...let me count the ways! 

DELICIOUS FRESH Asian combo food, prepared AFTER your order, GENEROUSLY huge portions, CLEAN environment, QUICK and FRIENDLY service, a management team that takes RESPONSIBILITY and truly CARES about your dining experience..ALL at an AMAZINGLY affordable price (ok...CHEAP by comparison to almost any other restaurant!).

Yes,I know this is a \"poor man's\" PF Changs (owned by the same company) and I've heard ALL the arguments from the snobby haters: \"Oh, they don't have as big a selection as PF Changs.\" and \"That's just a fast food place.\" or \"Their food is too salty.\" blah, blah, blah. I've only had ONE unfortunate experience in the two years I've been eating at this location, and when i brought it to the attention of management, they practically fell all over themselves fixing it to make certain I was a happy camper.To all you haters; don't let me keep you from your pretentious little 4 ounce fillet of Mahi for $70 at Roy's with the orange-mango syrup crapped out around the plate edges. 

Ahhh, but the food! its ALL good here. Personal favorites include the lettuce wraps, Pad Thai with shrimp and any variety of Kung Pao! Be certain to try some of your dishes with their fried rice; it's only an extra dollar, but you gotta ask for it.

I eat here so often, they know me on a first name basis...can't be beat!

A really friendly, clean, quality oriented business with EXCELLENT food at unbeatable prices. Also a GREAT place to bring kids if you have a family.

Nom, nom, nom!"}
{"text":"This place is way beyond average..Chop n Wok or Flo's is a must go.
If you have to have Pei Wei eat there and try something with scallops for a change"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is nothing short of awesomeness!!
Great food, quick service, well priced, inviting ambiance, trained courteous staff....can go on! We absolutely love celebrating our family occasions here. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Normally not a bad location. We have had good experiences here, even on busy nights. However, We have seen a decline in service and quality. Tonight we had a to go order. We bought honey seared chicken and orange chicken, both with salad instead of rice. 

The salad was mostly rice sticks and not a full salad between the two entrees. One salad had only lettuce and rice sticks. The other was soggy. The honey seared chicken only had seven small pieces, it was not big enough to feed a toddler. The orange chicken felt like regular portion at first, but was 2/3 snap peas. 

We also ordered mango California rolls. They were tiny, falling apart, and the wasabi entirely coated the bottoms of the rolls. 

We called the restaurant just before 9 pm (closing) and no one picked up. The location is on the way home from a lot of east valley. We will try again and see if anything improves."}
{"text":"Finally tried Pei Wei and overall we were very pleased.  I ordered the Spicy Ramen Noodle bowl which was not overly spicy, and tasted good.  Others ordered the Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and several appetizers of egg roll, lettuce wraps, and edamame.  Everything was good.  You can also opt for brown rice instead of white rice for a healthier route.  What amused me a lot were the Touch Screen Soda machines that had many varieties carried by Coca-Cola.  It was pretty cool!

Overall, good food, good service, okay prices."}
{"text":"The only reason I frequent PeiWei is because my son and his friends like it. Most of the food I tried there is either too salty, too greasy, or too sweet. Maybe that's why the teenagers love it. I would've given them a 3 star but my son rated them 5, so I took the average. I've tried their chicken pad Thai. Flavor was decent but the chicken was really dry. Chicken teriyaki was too sweet (I know teriyaki sauce is supposed to be sweet, but too much for me.
I'd recommend bringing your kids here, but don't recommend for date night. 
I've had Togo here few times and the employees were friendly and helpful but I saw few people waiting impatiently for take outs. I recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian but I come here pretty often. Tofu is good, vegetables are good, chopsticks are good, soy sauce is good, rice is good, noodles are good, overall I'd say pretty good"}
{"text":"Oh man do I love the new sushi rolls!! The mango roll, the cali roll, and the tuna roll are super yummy. Also, the crab/cream cheese wontons are super delish and I love the pad thai."}
{"text":"Epic fail for this Pei Wei. Came in 30 mins before closing to order food to go. Maybe the managers had left home because my bf saw two of the employees pick at the food that the cook was making. Health code violation for sure! Wish the employees were more cautious where they stuff their face. We didn't say anything, just took the food home. Definitely not returning to this one."}
{"text":"They say never judge a book by its cover, however the first impression is the one that counts the most. 

First time here at lunch time, I tried the chicken mei soup, only to find out it was not really a soup, rather just chicken with juicy noodles. It was good, but not what I expected. 

Second negative point: the place is DIRTY! I went to the restroom and the toilet was disgusting, many tables both inside and outside were still dirty with previous dishes. I saw a lot of employees wandering around, but clearly no one pays attention to the neatness of their workplace. 
My dish came out with some noodles that were already outside the plate. 
Is that how you work people? 

I don't think I'll come back unless desperate. Too bad since I work nearby."}
{"text":"I bought two egg rolls here and I'm not impressed with paying $4 for them maybe I'm cheap they were quite small."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place 2 stars because I truly love the food!  But they were severely under staffed and it created a horrible experience. Management needs to learn to manage and staff accordingly. 

We arrived and the place was overwhelmingly packed the line very long which is to be expected at 7 pm on Saturday night. I decided to grab the only available table while my husband ordered our food. The table was dirty but it was the only unoccupied one so I asked to have it cleaned 4-6 minutes later the young man came back to clean the table. 

When our food arrived we weren't given silverware or plates. We went up to the counter and the silverware dispensers were all empty and there were no plates the hot mustard and chili sauces were all empty  as well . We asked for plates and silverware and had to wait a few minutes while our food got cold. I went to get some of the mandarin tea and it was empty and the chai was empty too! Due to the fact there was no clean tables, no clean silverware , dishes , the condiments were empty and we had no plates I have no choice but to give 2 stars."}
{"text":"Re: teriyaki chicken - The \"chicken\" included several wholly inedible chunks, the rice was undercooked, there was not enough sauce, and the \"stir-fry\" vegetables consisted of raw onion strips and the flavorless bottoms of lettuce leaves. Absolutely horrible. Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Have never been here. Lived by here for years. It was good. Nothing wow really but it was good. The chicken I got was orange peel and a side salad. The salad was regular but the chicken was tasty. I came here on my lunch break. The one lady was very nice and gave a ups guy a cup for a drink for free. She ran back and fourth bringing out orders. She was very efficient . Overall good experience."}
{"text":"If you can't afford Pei Wei's big brother P.F. Chang's, but still want similar food, then you're at the right place. 

I always order cream cheese wontons, Diner Select Mongolian beef with fried rice and a drink. For the entree and a drink, expect to pay around $10/pp. It's not horribly expensive, yet it's not fast food cheap. The wontons are always consistent and good. Lately the Mongolian beef comes out SO dang salty that I have to return it to the kitchen for a re-do. Of course it's perfect the second time around but it's annoying when I have to wait for my new dish. The fried rice is always decent, no complaints there. 

The restaurant is tidy and the bussers are on top of cleaning up the tables. The soda fountain & tea is self-service so you can go up and get unlimited refills. If you ask nicely the cashier will even give you a cup to-go if you so desire. The chili and mustard sauce, fortune cookies, silverware and to-go containers are all located in this area. 

I go here for take out a lot. Call in at least 15 minutes ahead of your arrival and they'll have your order ready to go- including chopsticks, soy sauce, fortune cookies, etc.

Sign-up for Pei Wei's online email club. You'll receive discounts and some free goodies on your birthday."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing lunch. For \"fast food,\" our order took over 15 minutes to come out. They also served us in stages---our daughter received her entree and a few minutes later, two other dishes came out. A few minutes after that, the last dish arrived. It was awkward having four of us at the table, each waiting for something to eat, and when my husband's dish finally arrived, it was cold. 
There are two soda machines. One was out of ice and the other was spilling ice all over the floor creating a slippery walkway. The condiment station was pretty empty...no forks, no hot sauce, very few napkins. 
We've enjoyed other Pei Wei locations so I'm not sure if this location was just having a bad day or if it's poorly managed."}
{"text":"Fresh, perfectly seasoned, well prepared - I would say perfect. I ate one of the new salads chicken with a Thai lime dressing. I had them leave off the noodles. It was delicious"}
{"text":"I just moved to this side of town so I've eaten here a couple of times and I've always really liked it. I've had the Asian salad, the Mongolian beef, the honey chicken and a few more. Service is always great as well. Today, I ordered to go. We decided to try the new General Tso chicken and got some Mongolian beef. You can't tell me the portion size is off...( see pic below) . The beef was overcooked and cold and a very small portion. I always see the staff check out the meal before bagging it up. Between the cook and the to go guy, someone should have seen how terrible this looked. This is the 1st bad experience I've had here to be totally fair to them. I'm sure this was just an oversight. The General Tso chicken was spicy and delicious though. Definitely will try that again."}
{"text":"When you walk in, they take your order right away and they give you a number.  Then you get to choose where you want to sit.  They have booths and tables and a really neat drink machine where you can mix your drinks easily using a high-technology type of drink dispenser.  

As an Asian, this place is not your typical Asian food.  It's very Americanized Asian food and is a favorite of my friends who are not Asian.  I don't enjoy the noodle dishes, but I did enjoy the new \"Korean Steak Lettuce Wrap\".  It was very salty, but full of flavor.  If you like very flavorful food and you want to eat a little healthier... well kind of try, try out this dish.  

Overall, not my favorite place, but it's good.  BTW, be careful when parking. This place can be a challenge when trying to find a parking spot as it gets superful due to the complex sharing it with starbucks.  I would go during off hours and if you go during popular hours, look twice when backing out."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this Pei Wei...1st of all I ordered my food online & when I went to pick it up the girl had her back to me & 2 other girls worked (and saw some standing there) & we stood there for a few minutes..ok no biggie...then I get home & give my kids their kids meal & find 3 little pieces of chicken & a heap of rice & veggies...I paid for chicken...I think my food had been sitting for a while and I even showed up 10 minutes early than what online said. I live so close & was hoping for this to be my new go to spot but for the price I paid I am disappointed. Better off going across the street to Tokyo Joes & paying WAY less & better quality."}
{"text":"I've been to more than a few Pei Wei's to know a bad one when I see it. At least take-out-wise. Maybe they figure that once you're home you can't make a fuss but then there's YELP! (Hi fans)

Let's talk portions. Minimal. Miniscule. Micro. Don't expect the same portion you would get sitting down to dine. And don't expect to pay less for it. They cheat you, plain and simple.

Let's talk RIce. The worst white rice I've every had in a take-out. Mushy or rock hard lumps. Need I say more?

Let's talk Sauce. At this store they consider sauce a garnish. You get more moisture from the soy sauce packet. If they gave you 1/4 the rice, it would be the right amount for the entree sauce they serve up. As it is, what you get will just about color half the rice portion.

Finally, accuracy. It is near impossible to get a perfect order from these people. I've tried ordering pork three times and got chicken twice and beef once. The last time I opened it in-store and said \"I'd like pork in my Mongolian Pork please.\" It was chicken. It was a long wait for cold food.

This has to be the worst-run Pei Wei in the franchise. Don't pay the premium price - you won't get your money's worth."}
{"text":"O, this location has come a long way.  A few years ago it was a filthy mess.  That is no longer true.  However it is now a \"test kitchen\" according to the cashier.  Sounds good, right?  WRONG!  Now there are no small portions.  

Hello Pei Wei.  A lot of people don't want 1000+ calorie entres nor do we want to throw the excess on a large serving into the trash. 

PS - tell the cashier not to argue when told that I prefer the smaller size.  Your corporate decision to only sell the \"regular\" size does not negate my preference.  Your corporate decision to nix the smaller size seems a bit random."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and clean!! We ordered kids teriyaki chicken bowl and dynamite chicken with extra veggies both were great!!! Nice portion sizes for kids and small bowl."}
{"text":"This Pei Wei is consistently good, and this particular location has always been good to me. For a quick meal this is about as good as it gets. Pei Wei is a step above any takeout type Chinese food place, but not quite 5-star restaurant quality. To me, it's about a 4 out of a possible 4 for the type of restaurant they are. The quality is always good, the service is quick, they listen/care, and they'll let you adjust any meal to how you want it...exactly what I expect from any restaurant, but I'm always shocked how many don't do those basic things. The management team here has been excellent as well. If they screw something up, they've offered to give it to me for free, remake it, or just ask me what I want. They do all the basics right, and deliver a quality tasty product."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for dinner tonight. Super frustrating. I felt bad for the workers as they tried to deal with clearly being short handed and a horde of customers constantly streaming in. 

I'm now super caffeinated from drinking like four cups of soda while waiting so there's that..."}
{"text":"Short line wait. Helpful order taker who actually listened to whatbi did not wantbin my spicy chicken. It was hot and spicy hot which I liked but not enough sauce so I had to go back and get more which took 4 minutes-not happy about that part of dinner. In Phoenix options are slim for food and even slimmer for good fast food.  Reasonably priced with a lite beer from Miller for 17 bucks was able to catch mlb game while u was waiting for my flight which was directly across so no rush."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place has 4 stars. It is very expensive for what it is, not healthy, smaller portions, not tastier food than panda express (not that panda express has tasty food). 

I only gave this place 2 stars because the online ordering system is convenient enough, and service is efficient. If you want Chinese, I would totally recommend to drive a little further.  You can't really go wrong by not coming into this place."}
{"text":"Love pei wei but this particular locations lacks in service. They always seem
Short staffed, food is slow to
Come out and portions are smaller than other locations. Management really needs to step it up."}
{"text":"always good food at great prices. Good music and enviroment. I enjoy seeing the chefs cook."}
{"text":"Ordered chile lime chicken salad ,flavor is great but my biggets complain is they put alot of greens ,6 pieces of chicken and barely there rice noodles so to me this is not an asian salad ,and surely not the money worth ,if i want green salad i order green salad ...very dissapointed"}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a month because it's convenient to my home and office. If I'm with co-workers we will dine in, but usually I order online & just pick it up. They generally have your food ready in 15 minutes or less which is awesome. 

If you do dine in, they have a cool soda machine with dozens of flavored soda and juice options. I love the Hi-C fruit punch because mentally I'm 5 years old.

Oh and if you're a fan of tofu- definitely try theirs! It's excellent. If I'm in \"diet mode\" I'll just order tofu with quinoa (that's their new grain option and it is really good IMO), and some veggies and it makes for a delicious, healthy, protein-packed lunch. 

When I'm not in \"diet mode\" (which seems to be most of the time lately- eek!), I'll order the honey seared shrimp, add tofu, with quinoa and veggies. It's really good for \"fast casual\"!

Pad Thai with tofu is also yummy!

I think my only issue with Pei Wei is, they are way too heavy with the sauce 80% of the time. Often I will ask for my sauce on the side to avoid this.

Also, don't leave without taking copious amounts of the fortune cookies they leave out. I fill up the bag with handfuls of them every time and no one bats an eye!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here once every 3 months or so.  The food is decent."}
{"text":"This location of PW is right down the street from my house, so I eat here every once in a while.  It's predictable and uses good ingredients -- fresh veggies, all white meat chicken.  

I like that they'll sub or add things for you.  I always add broccoli to any dish that doesn't have it or extra to a dish that does.  I'm a sucker for broccoli.  It's nice not to be charged too.  And the brown rice alternative is a good option.

The serving sizes are large and generally too much for one person.  We'll do take out from here ocassionally.  For 4 people, we'll order 3 entrees and one order of lettuce wraps and that's perfect...no left overs and no waste.  

My faves are the Spicey Korean with chicken and the Ginger Broccoli with Shrimp.

It's not cheap, but the ingredients are quality.  Not traditional Asian food, it's more fusion.  It is what it is and I like it."}
{"text":"As others have said, this is a spin off of the PF Chang chain, but it's like fast food style.  You order up front and they bring the food to you, so they cut cost on wait staff etc.  And it's fairly fast.

One thing I'd definitely recommend is the hot and sour soup.  If you are with a group of a few people, get 1 bowl.  It isn't a typical bowl, there is enough soup for 5 people.  And it's tasty."}
{"text":"Expect a wait of 30-40 minutes most evenings during the rush. online orders typically ready 15-45 minutes past website or online order time.  

Food consistent. Girls at counter are quick, efficient, and know what they are doing.

They have many coupons when you join their rewards. Well worth it. And free meal after so many points."}
{"text":"This location, as all others I've been to, have friendly cashiers, long waits (since it's so popular and food is made fresh, not like Panda Express).  I love the lettuce wraps, soups, crab puffs, etc."}
{"text":"You really need to move that new guy, bald, portly, at the registers. He's so chaotic, confused, overwhelmed, and most of all, unfriendly and thankless to customers."}
{"text":"pretty good fast casual asian fare. This is a PF Changs brand. The prices are reasonable. I like the idea of being able to pick and choose rice, sauce, steam, stir-fry, etc... They have a couple different ice tea flavors. I would like to see them offer organic tofu instead of non-organic. Overall worth a try for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Our first time to a pei wei and we enjoyed it. The selections are numerous but not overwhelming. The steam option is nice for health conscious. Price is reasonable. The ice tea flavors and condiment choices are unique differentiators. We will be back."}
{"text":"Update: A Pei Wei Rep got in contact and resolved the problems in our local store. We ate there today and the store is back on track! I'm happy because we really love Pei Wei. And it's GF. A star upgrade too! Thank you! 

Are the meals getting smaller or am I getting bigger.? We ordered a regular Spicy Chicken takeout. We usually get about 10 -12 pieces of chicken and lots of rice. Instead, we got 6 mini pieces of chicken. Then today, we order the Spicy Chicken Salad and the lettuce mix was much smaller than normal. Skimping??? Their Chocolate Chip Cookies are shrinking too. Then it took over 30 minutes to pick up an online order. The man in front of me complained. He had been there even longer. They only gave excuses. Apparently, one customer said don't complain, they only make $10 per hour. How much will it take to do a good job? Poor customer service, nothing but excuses, and shrinking the meals. Their customers will shrink if they continue this business model."}
{"text":"Same owners as P.F. Chang's.  Keep in mind this is FAST FOOD, and judging it by what other fast food is like out there, Pei Wei hits a home run.

For modest prices, you get an order that easily feeds two people.  So, for less than $10, two people can eat a freshly prepared meal that is fairly healthy.

Very busy at prime dining hours.  Suggest early, late, or takeout order.

Blazing noodles is excellent."}
{"text":"Got the regular size meal and it was TINY!  Did not even feel me up!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Pei Wei we have ever experienced.  We are locals and visit this place several times a month.  The beer is always warm, they NEVER have cold glasses (third Friday in a row this has happened), they we're out of sushi and the tables had a sticky film all over them.  There does not seem to be a manager in the evening for dinner and the staff stand around the to-go area chatting.    They brought everyone's entrees out one at a time.  Avoid this place at all cost!!!  It is not up to the normal Pei Wei standards AND it is only a few miles from Pei Wei Corporate HQ.   You should spend your money at the other restaurants in the same shopping area, you will be much happier.  If I could give negative stars I would, this is our last visit to this location."}
{"text":"This Pei Wei location seems to have gone downhill in quality recently. Last two times I've been there for takeout the food wasn't even really edible. Most recent order I had kung pao chicken and noodles, had zero sauce on the noddles and the chicken was dried out and charred."}
{"text":"I love Pei Wei. The food is delicious. The service is usually super fast. Only problem we had today was a stray piece of chicken in my vegetarian daughter's lunch... Oh oh!

Overall they have a lot of tasty options for carnivores and veg-heads alike. And you can order any of their menu options with vegetables and tofu, and I have to say, the way they prepare tofu is my favorite!

For relatively \"fast\" food, Pei Wei is an excellent option for delicious and healthy dining out."}
{"text":"wow talk about a taste from Asia this place is just awesome even donald trump would eat this knowing its from china this is just awesome top quality asian food that gives you the freshest of ingredients and will make your mouth water its just so amazing with there sauces and spices love it a little pricey but wish i can eat this every day seriously my life would be completed well my wife and kid completes my life but this food would to that amazing !!!"}
{"text":"I like the food as all dishes are made fresh.  The downside is that they can't seem to get your \"customized\" orders correctly.  I have ordered take out four times from this restaurant, so far three of them were wrong!  This last time I went in to pick up an order I placed online - 13 minutes late than the specified pick up time.  OK, the lady at the front had to send my order back to kitchen because it was not prepared based on what I wanted (sauce on the side), so I can understand the delay.  When the dish came out the second time, she just put it in my bag and sent me on my way.  I stopped her and asked her to look at what I ordered - both dishes were not done correctly.  She wanted me to wait some more so the kitchen can re make the order?!  I think this place needs better management in training the staff."}
{"text":"Two stars! First why I gave it two stars and not one.  The food was good. Now all the bad stuff.  The place is dirty and yes like other reviews here there is dirty dishes and messy floors. The wait, OMG 40 mins for fast food Chinese.  This is not going to work. There is plenty of family run and own Chinese places in Gilbert that would welcome your business and certainly would not make you wait 40 mins for a bowl of orange chicken.  If you must visit this place I strongly suggest you order your food to go as they priorities orders to go.  When you get your food go and have a seat and eat there. The whole experience will be done in half time you will have to wait for your order if you order for sit in."}
{"text":"When you don't have time to drive or eat at P.F. Chang's . It's always a great meal and you can order online."}
{"text":"My wife's traditional chicken wraps came with a rock inside, pointed out to the waiter who only took it to the kitchen and a comment of the manager would be right out to talk to you. Still haven't heard from the manager, don't want anything, all we cared was for an apology which did not come from the waiter, the cook, and worse fro. The non-appearing manager."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of PeiWei but last night was my first, and last, visit to the Metrocenter location in Phoenix.  Sad to say, I will never go back.  My Mongolian beef was so chewy and a very small portion of meat for buying the regular size.  It was my birthday dinner and we didn't even arrive until around 8:40pm after a long day.  I was just going to choke it down but then decided no, this is my birthday dinner and I need to speak up. When I went to tell the server about my issue, she said she would need to tell her manager. As I walked up, the manager (no name tag so I didn't get his name) looked visibly agitated and told me there's nothing he can do about it now bc the kitchen was closed.  After my baffled expression he asked if I want a refund. I said sure that would be great. He was physically pounding his finger on the cash register computer screen and tried 5 times to get the refund.  He angrily said he would need to call his manager, it would be a few minutes, so I walked back to my table.  He did come up and offer me a $10 PeiWei gift card bc he still couldn't figure out the refund.  That was nice but quite honestly, it put a damper on my bday dinner.  I decided to take the high road and respond to his rudeness with kindness, but I would say this location certainly needs some training on customer service and satisfaction.  The Arrowhead location is always courteous and accommodating, so I think we will take our business there instead."}
{"text":"If you are anything like me, you tend to go to particular restaurants because you like certain items, or AN item, on their menu. In my case, I tend to order that item every single time. In a move bound to leave loyal customers scratching their heads, the brain trust at Pei Wei has discontinued their Orange Peel Chicken--my favorite item--as part of revamping of their menu. As a replacement, they are offering Wei Orange, a $5 item consisting of breaded chunks of white meat chicken served over white or brown rice. My thought is that the five dollar price is a desperate attempt to persuade loyalists like myself to give it a go. So, I did. While I did not dislike the new version, I don't prefer it. The old recipe was superior. There is an old axiom that says: \"If it ain't broke...don't fix it.\" I feel that this aptly applies in this instance."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, normally my only complaint is that the food is never ready. I order online and then go pick it up 30 minutes or so later at the time I ask for it to be ready, and I'm still waiting 10+ minutes for it. Today, they weren't super busy I still had to wait a few minutes for my food, but I get home and the food smells and tastes burnt. Not as enjoyable as it usually is. Not sure if I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The past three times I have ordered to go orders they tell me it will be ready in 15-25 minutes. So I wait about twenty minutes and get there and then it's not ready and have to wait about 30 minutes for my food. I wish they knew how to give appropriate times on when their food would be ready. I have toddlers and sometimes we are on a tight schedule to get them dinner and ready for bed and an additional thirty minute wait may make me decide to go elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"I stopped by after a Starbux to get some chicken lettuce wraps 
The service was mediocre....a bit slow for the time of day. 230 pm. 
After a 10 minute wait with no offer from the cashier or other staff for a water cup or anything the food finally was ready.
The cashier handed me the bag with no napkins or condiments 
I had to go back in and bag stuff 
When the box of chicken was opened it was syrupy sweet and not like the old recipe i remember from past orders
the lettuce was yellow and from the inner section of the head. 
PeiWei you can do better.    I get a better bang for my buck at Panda or Tokyo Joes."}
{"text":"Food is great but very dissatisfied with the service.   Received an email from their reward program for a free meal when you show your reward number at the register to be told that their rewards are down and it cannot be used on this visit.   Terrible customer service and a quite shady practice to draw customers into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food.  Loved the new orange chicken.  It was fresh,  hot,  and delicious.  Good job."}
{"text":"Pei Wei gets the bozack.

Super weak and fake (Chinese?) food.  It's like a sad, upscale aspiring Panda Express.  They even used that ubiquitous chopsocky type font from the 70's you usually see on karate schools and Chinese takeout boxes.  Panda Express is hokey too, but at least they know it.

I had some kind of beef noodle dish which I can only describe as severely overcooked ramen noodles with strips of teriyaki style beef.  They also put about 10 whole green onions in my bowl, which I thought was pretty funny.  

Another thing that bugs me is that, I think whoever is behind Pei Wei just lumps all things asian together and can't distinguish the differences."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is popular.  My kids had a sweet and sour chicken bowl.  I can't describe the sauce other than it was disgusting.  My husband and I each had a Pei Wei Spicy Shrimp Bowl.  Some spice but so so so sweet.  Way too much sugar.  Service was really good.  Food terrible."}
{"text":"Been waiting 30 mins for 4 to go dinners.  Not enough staff at this location.  We haven't eaten yet, so I hope it is good."}
{"text":"I had 2 entrees- Mongolian rice bowl with chicken and supergreen Thai coconut curry rice bowl.
The curry bowl was a mess. The sauce tasted like they threw all the ingredients together without ever tasting it. It needed a kick, for sure. The carrots and onions didn't add much to the dish, but the green beans were good and crunchy and the shrimp in the curry was fine. I do like my curry spicy, but getting the sauce right is crucial for a good curry dish! Back to the test kitchen for this one. Both meals are good sized portions, with plenty of rice as well as meat. 

The Mongolian bowl was much better- the sauce was good and there was plenty of chicken and mushrooms. I did get extra sauce on the side for both meals, because their entrees are always pretty much dry. Even the extra sauce portion wasn't even that much!!!! 
I had a 2 rice bowls for $10 coupon from their e-mail club, which included the $9 regular size bowls. So overall, it was a great deal. Shrimp was $1 extra but worth it. 
Service time for to go orders has improved since I started going here again within the past year. This location has a patio, which is a nice option to have if opting for a dine in experience. I hate the parking lot adjacent to Pei Wei, it's too tight and pretty busy. I opt for the lot behind Distill."}
{"text":"My shrimp Lo Mein Diner Select was missing some veggies as listed on the menu, and they were added after I pointed that out. My meal was to go, and when I got home I found there was no sauce on the entree. The menu lists a red wine sauce and garlic, and I tasted neither in this meal. It tasted like no seasoning was added at all.
The hot & sour soup, however, was very good. I've had some very good entrees at Pei Wei, and this was the worst.
At this Pei Wei and other Las Vegas area locations, the same thing has happened with missing ingredients when I get meals to go. All in all, a pretty disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Their Hot and Sour soup is amazing. I hadn't been here in a while & got 3 bowls to go. This should be a regular stop in the colder weather! It's tasty and makes a great snack or meal if you down 2 bowls at once. There are lots of yummy things in the soup, most of which I can name- tofu, chicken, eggs. Also some Asian style veggies that I cannot name. Alas, I cheated and looked on their Web site- (Official ingredients)- Chicken, bamboo shoots, tofu, egg and black mushroom. Yummy! The \"hot\" in the soup is not divulged, but it must be some type of red pepper spice. 

Their take out handling/packaging has always left me befuddled. This time, the 3 soup containers were stacked weirdly, and fell all over when I picked up the bag. Luckily, I knew that was coming, so I rearranged them. Perhaps an establishment that does a hearty take out business should invest some time in packaging said takeout. Just sayin'. 
The dining room area is nice enough, though I never eat here. It seems a step above Panda Express, etc."}
{"text":"Better than panda... we liked sesame chicken.. the only reason i gave 4 stars is tofu we ordered was not good... it was over fried and became chewy and it happened many times with us"}
{"text":"This chain is a joke and I've given it too chances to redeem itself. I'll get to the worst part (the food) later because I'd like to mention something very odd about this chain first. I've been to different locations and only in one were the employees friendly - all other times I've encountered extremely sour faced and sometimes downright rude employees. Almost always! I just thought it was coincidence the first 2 times, but no. It's very strange. Now with that out of the way, I'll get to why I will never ever go here again unless every other restaurant within a 50 mile radius from me gets wiped out for some reason and I have no choice: the food here is usually (but not always) absolutely dreadful. The noodle dishes are usually more tolerable than the rice dishes. However, just about every dish you order here, whether it's supposed to be Thai or Japanese or Korean, use the same generic sweet & sour type of sauce. If you're not into sweet food, you're out of luck here. I boycotted this place for 6 months until today (see my previous Pei Wei review). Today I ordered a new rice dish called Supergreen Thai Green Curry described as \"Wok-seared carrots, green beans, Swiss chard, onions, garlic, ginger and lemongrass, tossed with Thai coconut green curry sauce and garnished with Thai basil, scallions, cilantro and a lime wedge.\" Doesn't that sound delightful?! I was starving by the time it arrived 20-25 minutes later. I should note service today was also particularly slow. Even bland food should taste good when you're starving, right? Not in this case. I'm wondering how much more awful it must have been in reality if I wasn't so famished.... So on my table arrived a big mound of stale looking sticky white rice with cubes of chicken and this strange liquid closest in look and texture to clam chowder soup splattered on top of everything. My first thought before eating was \"Hey some of the best dishes are the least pretty\" so I went ahead expecting flavors of curry and basil and took a bite. What?! I thought surely this can't be, so I went ahead and took a second bite hoping my taste buds didn't correctly register the first bite. The taste of the green curry (a.k.a. clam chowder goop) was basically that of \"sugar water\". They didn't even get the color right! At least put a drop of green food coloring in thick sweet clam chowder stew! There was nothing green, let alone \"supergreen\" nor curry nor ginger nor coconut nor basil nor cilantro nor lime about it. I immediately told them this and asked for a refund. The 1 star is for them being understanding enough to refund me for the time wasted and being subjected to this mystery dish I was unfortunate enough to experience on this Easter Sunday. Otherwise zero stars is warranted. Probably my worst dining experience ever."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 stars as the food is sometimes good, but upon my 6th or 7th visit to this place  last night, I realized they make ALL their dishes from the SAME exact sweet sauce! Doesn't matter if you order fried rice, pad thai or mongolian beef.... THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME EXACT SWEET SAUCE!! Normally I can put up with it from time to time when I don't feel like going to other chain restaurants in my suburban neck of the desert. It's near my apartment. But, last night I had to ask for a refund after a few bites of the chicken pad thai. They were understanding. The pad thai was drowned in sweet sludge - only this time there was a lot more of it and it was even sweeter than usual. I guess your typical suburban American likes their so-called \"Asian\" food sweet. If that's your palette, you may like it here, but I'm done.

NOTE: Last night, both the cashier and servers were surprisingly very nice. I hadn't seen them before. The previous 3 times, the expressionless cashier was always extremely rude. Without any sort of \"hello\" or even half a smile, she would look at me as if I'm inconveniencing here and ask in a rude manner \"Is your order for here or to go?\""}
{"text":"I've only ordered togo at this restaurant. I did it once online. That went pretty smooth. Though I couldn't order my sushi online since it doesn't have options to omit things. When you walk in to order togo the menu is on 2 screens. You would think the purpose of this would be to order using a touchscreen. But not. Its just 2 screens and makes absolutely no sense to me. I guess behind the screens the servers can enter your order, but why not add more functionality to the front for customers? If you ask me they are pretty slow! I normally set aside 20 minutes to order and get my food. I love their food mainly because I can get SHRIMP instead of typical chicken or beef. The Honey Seared Shrimp is so delicious. Crispy shrimp in a honey sauce, where can you go wrong? I also love the Sushi. The Mango California roll is really good. I'm not a Sushi connoisseur or anything so it works for me. This is my go to place in the area for Chinese."}
{"text":"Don't order on the phone , they will forget about it and claim they never got it. -__-"}
{"text":"The Japanese noodles dish is by far the best thing I've tried on the menu. Awesome flavor, heat and the mix of beef and shrimp are delicious."}
{"text":"Something happened to Pei Wei. I have been going to this location for several years. Today was the last time. Everything that we usually order has changed for the worse. First was the Hot n Sour soup. Usually like PFChangs, but today was watery, tasteless, and bland. My wife's Pad Thai was so bland and had no flavor that she could only eat a few bites and left the rest. Terrible, she said. Same for my Terriyaki chicken on rice. No Terriyaki flavor at all. Occasionally to get one dish that's bad happens. But when EVERY menu item we ordered has changed to no flavor and tasteless - something happened to their entire menu. Food used to be similar to their flagship PFChangs restaurants. But now they are worse than Panda. Really really sad, they have lost us as customers for good."}
{"text":"Pei Wei is an easy option when you are looking for freshly prepared Chinese food quicky. They have a great selection of flavors and choices."}
{"text":"The restaurant had great managers a year ago and I loved going every week. Over the last twelve months it is getting worse and worse. Tonight, very busy and I don't mind waiting. When I got my carryout food, the soup and entree were both cold. The entree was served very sloppy, obviously they had made it wrong, took it back and thew some some stuff together. I also ordered extra veggie, but the portions were small. Based on this visit I will not be back. I believe the closed other Pei Wei is toward Tempe on Elliot road. I have only had good experiences at that location."}
{"text":"This place was starting to go downhill for a while but I didn't have the heart to take away a star. However, after a dine-in visit last Sunday, I can see they are back on course. The restaurant was clean and tidy and the condiment/utensils area was well stocked. The service was very friendly and quick. Someone even came running over to us with a bag after noticing me trying to juggle the takeout boxes wih our leftovers in them. Now if only they would bring back the curbside pickup!"}
{"text":"Great Tofu pad Thai ... Always consistent and fresh.  Smaller location but in and out quick.  Clean with friendly staff."}
{"text":"If I could give the store zero I would, I called 730pm for a to go order of lettuce wraps and they said they stop taking orders for the night since they are closing at 930. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Pei Wei is a good go-to dinner when we want something quick, easy and on the light side.  Love the online ordering for take out and eating there us pleasant too.  Love the spicy chicken salad and the iced tea is amazing.  I get both kinds and mix them. If you want vegetarian they jave really good firm soy they can add instead of meat.  Nice spices and some fiery dishes and cooling ones too.  A great meal where you know what tou are getting."}
{"text":"If you are in the working vicinity of 7th Ave & McDowell Rd and have a craving for cheap and tasty ASIAN, this is the spot to grab lunch during M-F.  

First off, it is faaaar from being authentic Asian.  The menu comprise of Chinese, Japanese, and Thai inspiration.  For a full meal with drink, the average cost is $9-10.  The 'Noodle and Rice Bowls' is going to be your bang for your buck dishes.  My favorites are Pad Thai and Fried Rice.  Very tasty! No matter how big my appetite is, I always end up boxing it later, but it'll make a great snack later!! :)

My other favorite is the Mongolian Beef! Very tasty!!  The keyword is TASTY! not Authentic, but TASTY!  If you are not familiar, most dishes come with WHITE or BROWN rice.

The flavor and ultimate concept is to please the general taste bud who  adores Chinese and Japanese food without the exotic ingredients.  Simple Asian packed with TASTY flavors!  If you seek authentic Chinese or Japanese, then you need to Yelp else where! That is the only caveat! ;-)

Also, this particular location is ALWAYS packed during lunch time. ALWAYS!  So expect a line between 11am and 12pm.  Parking is going to be very scarce too during this peak time!"}
{"text":"This was a decent place, but I'm a little bit more partial to the Mom-and-Pop restaurants.  Food in general tastes better when it isn't from a chain restaurant.  On the plus side, they do have a gluten free menu! :)"}
{"text":"Pei Wei helped to prevent me from making a total ass of myself last night after a day of drinking off and on since noon. We found ourselves at SideBar and I was mixing drinks. Not the smartest thing to do after taking it light for eating lunch. But, I'm prone to making bad decisions so rarely surprise myself. 

I ordered the crab-stuffed wontons and edimame, took that back upstairs and both helped take the edge out of my hunger pangs. Enough to have another cocktail!"}
{"text":"The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...

I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Placed a order online with confirmation of order for our dinner. Went to go and pick it up, they had no record of order nor food ready to go. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I used to love to eat at Pei Wei but the last few meals I have had have been disappointing to say the least.  We just ordered it for probably the last time which is what prompted this review.  My wife got the chopped chicken salad which used to be full of chicken but the last few times it is hard to find any chicken in the bowl.  I got the Mongolian beef and although the taste is not bad, once again, there just is not much to it.  They may just be cutting back because of the economy but I guess I have to as well since I am not getting my money's worth anymore.  

Two years ago when they opened, I would have given them 4 stars....not so much anymore."}
{"text":"Service and cleanliness get 5 stars.

I have not dined in, ordered take-out at the counter and on-line.  Both methods proved extremely easy.  Cashiers were courteous and efficient.  The menu is fairly small, a bit of variety, and not overwhelming, but could use more main dish and sushi options (although it was nice to not be bombarded with too many decisions, especially as indecisive as I am).

Tastiness of food and value get 3.5 stars.  

Traditional Edamame was not so good, little flavor and not fresh.  Kinda like what you get in the freezer section of the grocery store.  

Ahi Tuna Bowl (limited time) was decent, but would not order again.  I would have liked bigger pieces of tuna and the way it was prepared it was mushy, also prefer less of the Asian slaw, but all in all good flavor.

Orange Peel with tofu sounded wonderful, but had little flavor.  I could not taste any orange or any garlic and it definitely was not spicy.  I got it with tofu.  The tofu was sliced in thin flat strips which I'm not used to, but liked for a change.  It was pretty firm and dry, which most people, especially those who squirm at the thought of tofu, would probably enjoy, reminded me more of a slice of steak or chicken.  However, I actually think I would have preferred softer, cubed tofu. 

Pei Wei Spicy with Steak got an average rating from the husband.

Sushi Rolls - A pleasant surprise and what I will go back for, especially when I want a quick, light snack.  I'm not saying it's the best, there is tons of competition in this department in the area, but for convenience and price (but not necessarily variety) it was great.  

Wasabi Crunch Roll was fresh and tasty.  This is what I will be ordering from now on.

Spicy Tuna Roll did not seem very fresh and did not have tons of flavor but was ok.

Teriyaki Crunch Roll was pretty good, but a bit sweet for me.  Much prefer the Wasabi Crunch Roll.  

I will be back to try out more items and appreciate the efficient service and clean fresh ambience."}
{"text":"Our food was served Luke warm. The sweet and sour chicken was terrible. I ordered Brown rice which was not cooked completely"}
{"text":"Serviceable Asian like food.

Dan Dan noodles were good, but enough for two...or one really hungry person.

Very loud restaurant.  The more people the louder it got.  They play music in the restaurant, but you can't hear it over the ambient noise...it just adds to the din."}
{"text":"They serve Chinese like food.  So they have that going for them.  Although I do have to admit I like their Dan Dan Noodles."}
{"text":"Waited a long time for my food only to have it come out with the avocados still having part of the exterior peel and interior nut attached. Yum...."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with my experience here tonight. This place has went downhill in my opinion. We ordered Kung pao chicken and orange peeled beef with a side of Vietnamese rolls. The rolls were tasty but the wrapper was hard and chewy on one side but it was still edible. Then we got our meal and the Kung pao was dry and very little sauce almost seemed like it had been cooked for awhile. My orange beef had chunks on cornstarch with also little sauce. I complained to the manager and he did remake me a different dish of the Mongolian beef but this time it was so oversauced and salty that I could barely eat it. Also the mushrooms were in gigantic chunks!!! Not appetizing at all! Then to top it off I got the chili sauce to maybe help the flavor and the glass container is broken which can't be safe! I actually thought I should of just went to Panda Express. I thought it was rude that the manager didn't even come over to see how things were. Very, very disappointed tonight!!!! I doubt I will ever return . Oh I forgot to mention it took about 30 min to get our meal. Also when I informed the worker  about the broken container he said thank you and put it back on the shelf. I took again it to the manager and hopefully he really did throw it away"}
{"text":"Something has definitely changed at this location. I work nearby and come here frequently. I generally order the same thing every time so I'm very familiar with how the dish used to be made.

About 2 weeks ago and then again today I ordered Regular size Kung Pao Chicken with fried rice and extra chicken to-go. 2 weeks ago, I noticed the portion size was about 40-50% smaller than it usually is. I figured they must have made a mistake and made the small size instead but I was in a hurry so I let it slide without inquiry.

Today the experience was the same so I asked the server at the counter  and she assured me it was Regular size with extra chicken. $12.95 for this? No thanks!"}

{"text":"I love Pei Wei for their Mild Dan Dan Noodles with ground chicken and no bean sprouts.  It is so good and I can eat it every day if I could.  I almost always order take out, so their online ordering is very convenient for me.  I order, work for a bit, then head out, park in the \"To-Go\" parking spots, run in, bypass the eat-in diner line, grab my bag and I'm out the door.  I've never had a bad lunch there.  Their honey seared chicken and shrimp over a bed of rice is also pretty good.  Love this place.  People can call it the \"white man\" Chinese food all they want but I sure as heck love it."}
{"text":"This place is always consistently good.  I love eating there because I like their computerized Coke dispenser.  So many flavors to chose from!  My favorite dishes are the Mongolian beef and the dan dan noodles with chicken.  The lettuce wraps are also delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Pei Wei and I didn't walk in with high expectations, but they didn't really live up to even the low ones I had set.

Having had the flu last week, I decided to stick to something mild and safe on my first real meal back. I ordered a bowl of wonton soup and a kid's size of lo mein. My fella had the sweet & sour chicken with white rice. 

I ordered in advance and when we arrived our meal was sitting on the counter ready for pick up. My soup was bland, good my stomach couldn't handle much, but under normal circumstances it was too boring to order with mushy bits of wonton floating around in it. The lo mein had a lot more sauce than I was expecting. It was overly sweet and I had a hard taking a bite or two before giving up on that mess. My fella didn't like his meal either so I don't expect to give them another visit any time soon."}
{"text":"This food is garbage. Everything has the same texture...mush. I ordered noodles with sauce and I still haven't located the sauce! So basically I ordered dry noodles I guess.  Crab puffs are mushy warm crab filled nastiness. And my honey seared chicken are just sauce covered balls of mush. My lettuce wraps have a weird after taste that just doesn't seem right. How do people eat here? I don't understand it. Refund please!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. I went yesterday with a friend of mine and the food and service was fantastic. I will defiantly go there again"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, excellent service and seriously delicious food. A lot of healthier options too (you can make most dishes a salad-YUMMY). We eat here at least once a week. I love the online ordering option. The Pei Wei Spicy is my favorite and my kids can't get enough of the honey seared chicken with noodles."}
{"text":"The food of this location is mediocre. However the service is very bad. If you arrive at the busy hour you would not be attended unless you ask for service.
You have to be very aggressive in order to be served. This makes the dining experience very unpleasant."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Pei Wei for a long time. Probably go there once every one to two months. For the longest time the restaurant stayed the same. I liked their food. It has a nice fresh taste and you know it is fixed fresh as they fix it as you order. 
Not sure what they are doing as they have changed the restaurant menu or the way they present the menu to you three times in the last year. One of the new features i like is they now have a smaller proportion available. I am a fan of being able to order a smaller proportion. That was the good.
They no longer offer the fortune cookie. There used to be a big bowl full of them and people could take as many as they wanted. If you wanted to save money just give everyone one as they order their meal. i like the fortune cookie. Yes i know this is petty on my part but come on. They used to have the nice thick napkins but those are gone also. Your table used to be set with silverware, now you have to pick up your silverware by the drink machine. They also used to have the hot mustard available on a rack by the drinks. Now if you want some you have to ask. Seems the small plates are a little less than the regular plates were before the change and the large plates are more than before. 
Today my brown rice was about 5 minuets from being cooked. I was offered to remake my meal but then I would be eating when everyone else was done waiting for me, so I did not ask to have it redone. 
I really do not like the way the restaurant has been changed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in at this location and I've been coming here for months/years. The Kung Pow chicken was not very tasty and part of the white rice was cold.  Won't be coming to this location again.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"I love how fast this location is, hardly crowded and clean! The Wasabi Crunch Roll is my fave1 Good for fast good tasting sushi on the go. Next Fave is the Steak Mongolian Beef with Brown Rice, YUMMY! Servers are great and manager is helping out quickly which is always great to see!"}
{"text":"Shrimp in Lobster Sauce over White Rice and the Chicken Lo Mein are my 2 favorite dishes here.

Even though the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce is not on the main menu anymore they will still make it for you. Will need to tell the whether you want it over White or Brown Rice.

I love the drink dispenser where you select which drink you want, I believe pei Wei was one of the first places to get this from coca cola.

Would recommend eating family style to try different dishes and sharing your favorite items."}
{"text":"Good quick Chinese Food geared for American taste. Good flavor and spice flavors to range from zero to medium hot.

Shrimp and Lobster Sauce is my favorite dish but us not on the menu anymore but if you request it they will prepare it for you.

Chicken Lo Mein is also one of the better dishes, cooked more like Cantonese Style so it is zero heat. A good mix of sauce mushrooms and other ingredients. 

Honey Seared Chicken is almost similar to sweet and sour without the sour. Good dish and flavor.

Mongolian Style Beef good gravy mix for white rice. 

Not real authentic chinese food but good tasting.

Lately they don't seem to have fortune cookies anymore."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this Pei Wei. I hope the lackluster food was just at the particular location because I would dislike to ex out an entire franchise. I've only been to Pei Wei once and that was years ago. The order process is already kinda weird so when I was ready to order, the girl asked me if I was dining in or ordering to go.  I said to go and she says \"well this is the dine in line but it's ok\"...did she really need to tell me? There was no one else in the line so I wasn't holding anyone up AND she worked both lines so what the hell does it matter?  

The food from a scale to 1 to 10 was a 0.  I've never ate food with no taste.  The chicken was dry, the noodles had absolutely no seasoning.  There was only so much soy sauce I could put, I mean I had to salvage the one pack that they gave me. Cheapness.  If I wanted noodles with no taste, I could have boiled my own for free.  Lesson learned.  You guys will never get my business again!"}
{"text":"Convenient.. fresh.. easy. The food is almost always made fresh on the spot, service is good, and the environment is nice. If you're looking to have a quick bite of Chinese food that is not too pricey.. this place is great. Super friendly service and no need to wait a long time to get your food!"}
{"text":"Pei-Wei is good and fine by me as a business, but the people running the show at 7th avenue and McDowell handled my customer situation poorly by picking up my meal by accident and than wanting to count the rice, veggie's and if it had chicken or not when they tried to give me a partial replacement.  Hello, don't inflame your mistake by treating the customer poorly and justifying your error by counting what is on the plate.  Than the manager comes over while I decided to request a refund a $25.00 gift card purchased on this visit meant for a friend as a gift, as who could send their friend to this location, not I?  So, I paid for my meal and was treated very poorly after their mistake, as he further inflames the situation by repeating the same inflammatory comments as the previous employee.  You saved 3 pieces of chicken on the partial replacement that I would never accept either way due to the brutal ineptitude of this staff, as lost a customer at this specific location forever!!!!  Happy to go to other Pew-Wei's in the future!  The employee who refunded the gift card, handled the situation well, as feel sorry for her and the staff that are under this specific manager..."}
{"text":"Not to sure why the other reviews weren't as good, but I like Pei Wei. Yes, this is the same (for the most part) as PF Chang's (same owner) but it's fast food and quicker. It's also a scaled down menu, too. 

I like that it's close to my house, so I can just pull up and head in the delivery door. 

I don't typically eat inside, but I've been to several Pei Wei's in the valley and this one is good."}
{"text":"Now, I have finally had the worse Chinese food I've ever had. 

I normally will not come to Pei Wai for Chinese food. I happened to be in the area and didn't have anything for lunch. I was pretty hungry when I walked in. I was thinking ... It has been a while since I've been to Pei Wei. Let's see what has changed. 

Apparently they change from bad to worse. I ordered a beef dish with dynamite flavor. It \"looks\" good until I took a bite in my mouth. The beef was fried so much that there was hardly any meat in it. I felt like I was chewing on rubber. The flavor is so soar that I could hardly bite into it. You wouldnt think they could mess up the white rice right? Wrong. It was dry and cold. 

I couldn't believe what I just ate. Yelpers...if you want authentic Chinese food, please please go somewhere else. That isn't Chinese food..."}
{"text":"Only go if you have hours to waste! I used to love this place. We were regulars twice a month but the last 2 visits have been a disaster! It has taken 45-50 minutes both times to get our food. Both times our order was wrong and the chicken was burned! We called for to-go and they told us it was an hour for pick up. This location can't get it together. Pick another location."}
{"text":"We have been regular diners at Pei Wei for years. Its convenient and the food and service are  pretty consistent.  Pei Wei spicy and the Chopped Chicken Salad are our regular entrees. The salad is the one item that is not consistent, i.e. today the greens could be a lot fresher. A lot of wilted going on and the tomatoes were mushy.  But overall, we enjoy this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Sometimes food is consistently excellent.  Sometimes a chain can keep food exciting and fresh.  Pei Wei does just that.  On a recent trip, I ordered their sweet potato fries and they were the best fast food sweet potato fries to date and came with a tangy dipping sauce.   

The ambiance at each location I have visited is relaxed and upscale, with dark tones and furnishings.  But it's the food that I come back for.  Their large, inexpensive portions will make you a fan.  The lettuce wraps are on par with those of PF Chang's and their spring rolls and crab wantons are slightly above average.  It's their entrees and salads that are standouts.  Their Pad Thai Chicken or Shrimp meals are flavorful and just as tasty reheated because you'll probably take half of it home.  If you're a lettuce head, the Spicy Chicken Salad is fantastic (it's my second favorite salad next to the Ruby Trout Salad at Z Tejas) and you can kick up the heat meter by adding the chili sauce and hot mustard.  I live by another excellent Asian Diner, Tott's, but I find it hard to decide which of these 2 great places to eat at when I want great food fast.

Sign up for their email club and become a fan on Facebook.  They send out discount coupons periodically."}
{"text":"While waiting in line being the next one to order our food, the employee taking orders walks up to us and rudely says tells us the is no room for us in the restaurant. I asked \"So you are asking us to leave?\" And this employee says, \"Yes we absolutely cannot seat you.\"
There was no sense of nicely asking us to wait or even telling us sorry while we were being kicked out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened and have never had a bad experience. I would give them a higher rating if they had better cusotmer service and we're a bit more organized. The food is always superior and my kids have special orders and they have always been made just as ordered"}
{"text":"They put all of my chicken on my sister's pad Thai instead. They did offer to make me a new pad Thai with some actual chicken. So I'm a satisfied customer... I'm still grumpy that I had to wait for chicken but the food was good and they fixed it. So no stars will be deducted at this time."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill .. ordered crispy honey chicken..the white rice was old and you can tell it had been sitting for a while..they hardly give u any chicken anymore.."}
{"text":"P F Chang at  1/2 the price! 
- 1 star because the bathrooms are iffy at best.
Food is awesome and consistent"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the restaurant was filthy. Food all over the tables, chairs and floor. There was even food splattered on the window blinds. This used to be a nice location but it has certainly gone down hill."}
{"text":"Just because i feel like doing something different. :P
i'm just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell...

Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
I said the truth is here the truth is here

I want more
Give me more
We want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
We want more
I want more and more and more
I want more
We need more
I want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

[Verse 1:]
I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

[Chorus: x2]
I want more
We need more
I want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is

[Verse 2:]
Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold, not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground

[Chorus x2]

I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is


the atmosphere is pretty hot here too..exposed brick always makes me Yelp!"}
{"text":"i believe this was one of the first pei wei's in the valley and it was pretty good when it first opened. it hasn't really ever disappointed me. its good for some quick chow. they have a pretty good orange peal deal. i prefer the beef in this dish over the chicken or shrimps. but thats just me. which matters more to me then you. but..i'm sure you would disagree with that statement. but i don't really care...because its about me ya heard?

anyways..it's A-OK in my books..i actually prefer the McDowell/7th Ave location now..so..meh!."}
{"text":"I've been eating Pei Wei for since 2002 when I worked there in college and have always been a fan, but a couple years back this location turned into a marketplace type setting, which really turned me off.  I think this was done for a lunch crowd and more appropriate vibe for lunch, but my take-away is smaller portions and higher prices.  Don't get me wrong, I still love Pei Wei, but I have to go to 44th and Indian School to get my fix since that location is true to the original concept from 2002."}
{"text":"I thought the old Pei Wei was okay, but didnt fully appreciate its subtle virtues until we walked in today. Sheesh. They removed all the comfy booths in favor of regimented food court tables, reduced the overall seating area, downgraded the condiment and self serve drink stations, replaced chinaware with plastic shells reminiscent of Kids Cuisine tv dinners. The whole thing is depressing. 

The food is worse than before - at least mine was - and as others have mentioned the portions have gone on a crash diet.  Healthy upgrade, s'ppose, since my tongue informs me they've piled even more sugar and salt into their sauces - if that's possible.  The limited menu is a little cheaper, I think, but doesnt approach the variety, appeal or value Pei Wei built its rather middle of the road reputation on. 

My bill was also screwed up. At least twice. First, they quoted the wrong remaining balance on my debit card, so I had them void the transaction and bill to another card, at which point they charged me for a phantom drink.  The manager wasnt able to credit that, so voided the entire sale again and billed me a third time. I now have three receipts. 

It'll get straightened out  and I have no problem whatever with the girl in front, or anyone who works there. But these systematic, abrupt downgrades scream customer indifference....you can almost hear the sneering boardroom banter all the way from Manhattan."}
