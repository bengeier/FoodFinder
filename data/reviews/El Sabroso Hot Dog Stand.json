{"text":"I know I asked for 3 hot dogs , one of them with only cheese and beans but I didn't ask for 5-6 beans on my freaking hot dog.... first and last time I eat at this stand"}
{"text":"The girl with the blonde hir had a bad attitude food was so expinsive for 14 tqcos 31 dollars !! Bad service and expensive never again Thank You but no l."}
{"text":"I am surprise by the negative reviews, this is my favorite place for hot dogs along with their other location on 43rd and Indian School. The hot dogs are delicious, they are open late, and service is good. Sometimes it might take a bit to get the food but they make it as it is ordered therefore I don't mind the wait. We normally go with a large party too after our kids football practice and have never had an issue."}
{"text":"Me & my boyfriend have been coming here for years & the food is always good & the service ok. The past couple of months  when we've ordered through the phone the lady hangs up before asking for my name or even letting me know how long its going to take & when we go to pick up it takes her a while to get to us. I called on Wednesday & ordered 3 hotdogs. When we got there it was kind of busy, so we understood why the lady couldnt attend to us right away. However, 2 men came after us & after about 5 more minutes the lady went straight to them & began taking their order. Keep in mind we were standing in the entrance the whole time, she had seen us, & passed by us a couple times. The hotdogs are good but not good enough to balance out the bad customer service. We left & definitely won't be coming back. 4 stars for the hotdogs & 0 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great and are open late for the midnight munchies! My favorite the cheesy fries with sliced hoy dogs!"}
{"text":"Food really sucks the quality of the carne asada looks like ground beef. The hot dogs were ok but nothing to come back for. Only reason for 2 star is there open late"}
{"text":"Just good old Mexican Comfort food. I had the Al Pastor my wife had the Hot Dog, Father in-law and little boy had the Carne Asada.  All were well prepared!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this stand 2 stars because of their horrible service!!!! Me n my husband have been going there for a while we used to come 2,3 sometimes 4 times a week but we moved to Mesa n today July 17,2016 we stopped by at 2am we got there n we had to ask for someone to take our order she did n me n my two girl friends asked for 1 hot dog n 2 tacos each so she left n came back with my husbands order n what was supposed to be mine n the girls order she completely messed up our orders n when we told her to please correct it she got pissed took our messed up orders n threw them in the trash my husbands was the only right order n she went to put our order again supposedly we kept waiting for 1 hour and a half until I got up n told them what was going on n they said I had to wait at that time I asked to cancel my order n to get the owners number when I call the owner a girl answered n they acted like she didn't care I don't think they gave me his number I think they gave me the stands number it's sad that their food is good but because of their service people started walking off including us"}
{"text":"Awful! Nastiest hot dogs ever! I love Mexican hot dogs. But this place is the worst one in town! Service is ok don't get me wrong. But the food is nasty. Carne asada very bad quality too! I've been here 2 or 3 times but never coming back!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs were okay. Service was okay . Nothing special . If you want good Sonoran hotdogs travel down the road by 35th Ave and Thomas. Really good hotdogs there, probably won't be coming back to this spot."}
