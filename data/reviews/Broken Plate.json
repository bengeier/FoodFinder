{"text":"This was my second time eating at Broken Plate. Tonight's server was Drew. Originally from Burlington, Ontario, server Drew was pleasant and professional. Being the only server on this evening, he managed the tables well checking up on everyone.

I had a lobster bisque soup to start that was very salty and was rejected and replaced with a tangy chicken soup. It was not the greatest soup but it wasn't bad.

For my main I had the tuna special which was cooked medium on the outside but was still cool in the centre. It was sushi grade tuna and was still delicious. The couscous was well seasoned and tasted great.

It was a Shane that during my last visit (although a year ago), there was a promotion with my hotel. 

The ambiance at broken plate is great and I enjoy visiting when I am out this side of Calgary."}
{"text":"Nice ambience!! Great food!! Fast service!! i love the wine lists!! I'll come back for the fourth time!"}
{"text":"Food and service were both so good. The bottle of wine was too small, but the food portions were very generous. :-) will definitely be going back. We had a \"platter for 2\" (Sunday special)"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Broken Plate and it was very enjoyable. Modern decor, friendly service, and excellent Greek food made for a wonderful night out. We started with hummus & pita and it was excellent. I then had the veal lemonato: three medallion-sized pieces of veal cooked with lemon (absolutely delicious!) accompanied by rice pilaf (slightly overcooked), broccoli, asparagus, and baby corn. A glass of sauvignon blanc rounded out the meal. Overall, it was an excellent evening and my only criticism would be that our waiter was a little on the slow side (but otherwise he did a decent job).

Take note: If you're looking for souvlaki, you won't find it on the dinner menu - it's only offered at lunch."}
{"text":"We would give them 10 stars but this is only out of 5. Max was an awesome server perfectly professional. Dolmades served warm and homemade absolutely delicious.  Wine half price  even better. Moussaka huge portion but best bechemal  sauce I've ever had. Lamb skewer cooked perfect with roasted red pepper side. Make reservations it's small in there but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Since we frequent this establishment quite a bit, it has to be one of our favorite restaurants in Calgary. The food is consistently good and the service is excellent. We've never experienced a bad meal from this restaurant. The lunch menu offers some great deals, and the dinner menu has some great selections. My favorite is a toss-up between the Ionian seafood plate and the moussaka. The saganaki is worth experiencing too."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and our server made sure that everything was great for us. The calamari was not that great but the chicken souvlaki and the rack of lamb was amazing! The main course was worth the wait. I seldom eat lamb because of the smell but their lamb had no smell at all! We had the baklava cheesecake for dessert and it was equally amazing. Ambiance was also perfect. I would definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"A couple of my friends were in town again on business and whenever they come in - we always go out and have a meal together. However, one of them has a severe, life threatening food allergy - so finding somewhere he can eat always poses a challenge. His wife is very good at doing the research and making phone calls beforehand, explaining the situation. Luckily, Broken Plate was a place that was willing to accommodate us. 
As soon as you pull into their lot, there is ample free parking available. The restaurant itself is inviting and warm inside. The placement of the tables feels cozy, but there is the right amount of space between them that you don't feel that the party seated next to you is so close that they have no choice but to eavesdrop on on your conversation. The staff is not only welcoming, but extremely efficient as well. Our server was especially patient and attentive to the questions of dish preparation and/or ingredients asked by my friend to ensure that this would be an enjoyable meal and not a trip to the hospital. I was especially grateful for the fact that if he didn't know the answer for sure, he admitted when he didn't know but was willing to take the time to ask the kitchen. 
Myself I had the Lamb Sword, served on Rice pilaf and accompanied by grilled vegetables. Now, I was quite pleased that the lamb itself was Roasted and seasoned to perfection and the vegetables were prepared in such a way that it all made my tastebuds really take notice. The rice was fluffy, nothing spectacular - but good enough in the sense that it is what you expect it should taste like as a side. 
Luckily, bc there is no cross contamination with the fryers and the tzatziki did not contain any ingredients that my friend is allergic to, we were able to indulge in something he said he loves but doesn't get to have often because of the way most places prepare it - Calamari. It had such nice, crispy texture and a tasty batter without being greasy. The squid itself was done well and not rubbery. So good we ended up ordering a second plate to share. As their main, they  had ordered the lamb shank, and they couldn't stop raving about it. Bathed in a mushroom demi-glace, even just looking at it made my mouth water - and I don't even really care for mushrooms! 
And to top it all off, our bill for the night was extremely reasonable for the quality of the food. We discussed how more often than not, bc of his allergies, when they go out to eat, and even in the times when I have been with them - it seems to be only the extremely expensive restaurants that will accommodate the food/cooking limitations. So what a treat it was to not have to pay an arm and a leg to savour something so scrumptious. 
We are all looking forward to our next visit! As this is now somewhere I have confidence in going to whenever I crave Greek cuisine."}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant whenever I can when in Calgary, which has been fairly frequent, as it is my favorite in Calgary.  I highly recommend the Salmon Exohiko, however the Lamb Shank, Greek Baby Back Ribs, and Moussaka are also excellent as well."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the lamb pita for lunch yesterday! My plate looked like it was out of a magazine! And tasted better than it looked! I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is so awesome! We went for my cousin and sister's birthday and they were so amazing to us. We just ordered starters and some entrees to share among the group. Our waiter, Gene, was great and brought us extra pitas when we ran out, not once but twice! He also put up with our other crazy demands with a smile on his face. 

We weren't a huge fan of the Saganaki which is a cheese that is flamb√©d. It is great to see the huge flames but the cheese is rather heavy in the stomach. The lobster ravioli was delicious although I wish that it was a little warmer. 

I will be coming back here for sure to try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent, I had the prawn saganaki which tasted awesome. The wife had the Zeus chicken- excellent. Great atmosphere in the restaurant too."}
{"text":"This place looks nice. Food was good. But I know why the place was empty. There is 0 value. I ordered a Horiatiki salad for $15 and added chicken for $5. 
The chicken came souvlaki style with 5 really small cuts of souvlaki (maybe 1.5 oz total). 
Salad came in an average size bowl, but there was no salad. 
My partner ordered a calamari salad as well. 

Bill came to $45 and now we are trying to figure out if we should go to McDonalds or Tim Hortons to get a sandwich to fill up. 

ZERO Value here."}
{"text":"Don't you hate it when some little thing throws you off just when you want everything to be perfect? So the two of us made a dinner reservation here. We walked in the door and waited to be seated. A party of five then walked in behind us. The host spoke to us briefly then waved the party behind us through and took them to their table while we stood waiting. Hmm....this just didn't feel right. He did return quickly and ushered us off past many available tables to a table in the farthest corner of the place. Could it be that we are not the beautiful people? With those two downers out of the way, it was time to eat.
The calamari starter was excellent. It was a very generous portion and the batter was crispy without being oily. Next we split a Greek salad and were amazed that it contained exactly one Kalamata olive. The feta on top was enough to completely fill a thimble. For entrees we had a lamb sword and the Zeus chicken. Both were good. The chicken featured a creamy sauce with spinach and what must have been ouzo. We were especially pleased with the very tasty Greek potatoes and the yellow beets.
It turned out that the host was also bus boy and bar man. Maybe it was his first day on the job...you think? Our full tummies allowed us to forgive him."}
{"text":"Oh they have great selection of unique foods and they have such good cheese the whole experience is so much fun and a great romantic dinner date. The atmosphere is beautiful and very cozy they offer good prices and large plates. Fresh food is always important for me and they do serve the best ! I recommended checking it out."}
{"text":"Service was top notch. The food came hot and delicious. The homemade pasta is to die for. The chicken was also wonderful. Make sure you order the prawns appetizer it is amazing"}
{"text":"Simply solid!

We walked into the Broken Plate after walking out of another restaurant due to lack of service.  We were not in a good mood.

As soon as we opened the door at the Broken Plate we we warmly greeted, quickly seated, and were met with consistently excellent service.  Thanks Steve.  I have been here before and it was quite good.  Nice to see it still is.

We ordered the calamari, which was perfect with the wine and cold Mythos beer.  The mains were a \"Sword Chicken\", which came on a skewer and the chicken penne (Kotopulo Trelo).  Both dishes were excellent.  

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, first rate staff, and food that is consistently tasty.  If you are in the South this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"Had a 5:30 reservation this past Friday evening. We were greeted at the front door, by the manager. He asked if we would be okay sitting at the higher tables, near the bar. (All these are tables for two).
We were greeted right away by a waitress, that introduced herself then took our drink orders. The waitress also let us know what they were featuring this particular evening.
The waitress, sorry I can't remember her name then took our order. We started with the calamari which wasn't anything spectacular, but was good nonetheless. The calamari was served with your standard lemon wedge, and tzatziki sauce. The calamari rings were also quite tender.
My wife ordered the feature, which was Mahi Mahi. The presentation of the food was good, and she also said it tasted very good. I ordered the greek ribs. It was a full back of ribs, that came with veggies like brocolli, small squash, and also greek potatoes.
My ribs were fall off the bone tender. I would definitely order the ribs again. It was too bad we both couldn't finish our entree's. Next time we won't order an appetizer.

With the two entree orders, the calamari appy and one soft drink, the bill came to around $75.00 with tip included.

The waitress also was very good at refilling the drinks.
Also both the manager, and the waitress enquired about our food while we were eating.  We both answered \" Very good thank's\".

I will definitely come back to Broken Plate in the future. It was my second time to this location, but haven't eaten at this location for over a year.

I should also say that I have been to the one on 10th ave in the Kensington area, and it was good as well."}
{"text":"Ah, Kleftiko  (aka Bandit Lamb).  My all time favourite dish and The Broken Plate does an excellent (if slightly overpriced) version.  I do wish the sides were a little more substantial for what you pay for the dish as a whole, but when you start pulling that ridicuously tender braised lamb shank off the bone you can forgive their shortcomings.

Oh, and if you are there around 9 I think it is, you get the joy of greek music, dancing and plate smashing  - OPA!! 

A few ouzo shots and you can complete your fairly pricy meal with some wonderfully decadent baklava!  Go on, splurge a little."}
{"text":"We returned to Broken Plate this past weekend to indulge in the Grecian Platter and it was so very good.  There is a nice variety of appetizers on it and it feeds two as a meal perfectly.  Service, as always, was great and the restaurant is clean as a whistle."}
{"text":"The night we went a belly dancer broke into the room, much to our collected glee!  We were told it'll happen frequently throughout the Holiday season--and it genuinely created a festive feel.  There's also the opportunity to smash some plates on the floor, if you so desire; but don't worry about injury--they provide plate smashing instruction.
The food is okay--which is all I can really say.  
The staff are terrific--very attentive, and prompt with things like refills and meal updates.
Overall--a decent night out."}
{"text":"Chart topping experience over here!  Upon entry you are greeted by a polite hostess and ushered to a seat in a cute restaurant with modern Greek music playing.  You can't help but get in the mood for an authentic experience.

I tried the Lamb Shank and my wife tried the Ionian Pasta.  The Lamb was tender fall off your bone and seasoned perfectly.  The tenderness was ridiculous, and a definite encore order for me in the near future.  The Ionian Pasta was loaded with in shell mussels, fresh calamari, and the shrimp that you should share .. but you end up eating all yourself.  

Servers checked on me often, and not just one, but others too.  Made me feel like they operate as one family rather than territorial paycheque players.  Amazing.

What took the cake for me was the GM coming out to check on our table.  All class with some background on our meals and a genuine desire to befriend us.  

It worked, we are coming back and on the regular."}
{"text":"DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE!!!
Should give them 0 if I could.
Terrible cooking, owner is a complete Asshole with terrible costumer service skills 
We got kicked out after twice the chef mistake our order, u heard it right, he made a MISTAKE, we asked for what we order ( meat cooked medium) and the owner came and asked us to leave....
Not a chance I'd let any of my friends to visit this place!!!
Use to love this place when they had it up in crowfoot , now it's disgusting"}
{"text":"Broken Plate just reopened after renovations. I loved this place before and even more now. The four of us had a variety of dishes: beet salad, lamb shanks, leg of lamb, seafood ravioli, rotisserie chicken, fries, broccolini, carrots. Salted caramel gelato and baklava. 
Everything was outstanding, very, very good. We'll be back. FYI: I had the lamb shanks: fall of the bone tender and delicious. 

Service was excellent, waitress friendly, ambience was a comfortable neighborhood vibe. Pretty good crowd for a Monday too."}
{"text":"We did not have a lot of time on our hands for dinner, decided to behave tonight and have salads so we decided on Greek. Not a fare we choose to have too often but we were hoping for Mediterranean freshness!
In we went and were seated with a clump of other diners in a not so busy place. The crowds around us were loud, bordering on obnoxious but we stayed put. I ordered wine and if it was 5oz by the glass it was the smallest 5oz I have ever seen! 
So, I had two.
We ordered the lamb salad and the calamari salad so we could share both.
Our waitress was pleasant and friendly.
If you like your salad crisp and refreshing, your best bet would be the calamari salad if you like seafood. The calamari was plentiful on top and not battered too thick which was nice. I liked the light touch of feta, fresh tomato, onion and cucumber with the lightly dressed romaine.
The lamb salad was nothing like the first, had no brightness to it. Just warm, dark spring type greens with red onion, pistachios and figs. I did enjoy the figs, wish there had been a few more on the plate! The lamb itself was OK, shredded and had decent flavour.
The music in the restaurant was odd - went from Arabic to Italian. Was hoping for more of a Greek experience.
2 salads and 2 glasses of wine = just over $50.
Not cheap, but nothing in Calgary is cheap."}
{"text":"My all time favourite restaurant. You can go classy or casual. Great place for any occasion!

Nothing on the menu is less than delicious - but if you're picky they're very good for being able to substitute, add or remove anything from your main dish.

Ask to smash a plate if it's a special occasion, and enjoy everyone in the restaurant joining you in a loud \"Opa!\"

Make sure to call ahead and make a reservation, as it gets very busy!"}
{"text":"On our first date,  my wife and I went for Greek food. Tonight,  for our twentieth wedding anniversary,  we went to the Broken Plate. 

The decor is only slightly Greek,  but the room is open and airy.  The hostess was prompt and friendly,  and gave us a nice table by the window. The server appeared quickly and was willing to answer our questions. 

The Trilogy of Spreads and the Saganaki  (Opal!)  were a nice start.   For the main course,  I  opted for the Lamb Sword. The Lamb was cooked to perfection,  with just the right amount of seasoning.   The vegetables were fresh and crisp.   The potatoes were good. The rice was okay. 

My wife selected the Kotopolo Trelo (I know,  pasta at a Greek restaurant seems wrong). She seemed to enjoy it. 

In all,  it was a nice experience and a good restaurant. We will likely try it again. 

Dinner for two with two appetizers,  one beer and one 6 oz. glass of red wine for $108."}
{"text":"I came to The Broken Plate for dinner with my work, and was really excited for Greek!  We ordered the Saganaki and the sampler trio that had hummus, tzatziki and a red pepper spread to start. I thought the pita was so, so good as were the dips. I love cheese, but I wasn't a huge fan of the Saganaki. As one of my co workers put it, it tastes like pizza cheese from a cheap pizza place. Either way, that was more or less personal preference. 

My issue was that I ordered the Golden Beet salad and by the description on the menu, it sounded as though it was literally a full beet salad, with figs, feta and some greens. Instead I got a green salad with a couple chunks of beets and few figs and cheese pieces. There was also TONS of onions which weren't indicated on the menu that it would be on the dish. (If you've read my other reviews, you'll know how frustrating I find that).

It wasn't just me that had issues with the food. Most people found their dishes to be very salty, however the lamb was apparently amazing. The service was good, the girl was really great and informative on the items on the menu. 

Overall not too impressed...I will still you Yiannis in Edmonton for my Greek fix :)"}
{"text":"Meats all excellent, rack of lamb, chicken souvlaki and salmon in phylo

Lemon potatoes over cooked and hard to cut with a steak knife

Veg overcooked and watery

But the meat wow

Order the rice with it,"}
{"text":"The Broken Plate has a wonderful atmosphere, and even better food. Yet beyond the food, the service is incredible. The service really is incredible. Originally I ordered a salad that was lacklustre in nature, however, the server willing changed it for something much better without a surcharge. I was really impressed with this bending over backwards.

As far as food is concerned, be sure not to skip the saganaki. It's sooooo good. And they light it on fire. Nothing sets the mood like a little flame."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable! My wife and I have a lovely time last night, the food was exactly what I was hoping for. Service was pleasant and decor is nice enough."}
{"text":"Myself and my dining companions enjoyed most of our food. Spanakopita, prawns Santorini and moussaka were Greek and tasty,   even the non-mediterranean angus burger was good. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. However the grilled pita tasted like barbeque lighter fluid and expected sides were only available for an extra charge. For example neither souvlaki or saganaki came with pita."}
{"text":"We were driving around in the SE and decided that since we missed dinner at 5, and at 6 we should try to have dinner at 7. With a little bit of discussion about where to go, I was able to convince my fiancee that we should try out this little gem.

Now remember that I am going by nothing more than, friends word of mouth and literally taking transit past it for almost a year straight. Also the only other greek restaurant that I have been to was Opa! Souvlaki...which is not a fair comparison at all.

We walked in and the first thing that we see is a bunch of waiters standing there with flaming plates...all right then this could be cool. Not having made a reservation on a busy Friday night, we weren't seated right away but then again we only waited a handful of minutes before we got a table.

Of course the first thing we ordered was our appetizers...but then seeing another table get the flaming plate treatment again. We decided no matter what we were going to try that as well. Mmmh cheese on fire...now it may not sound that good. But its about the way they present it, and I personally love a unique food and if its a little bit sweet. I will not complain.

Not a single complaint about the food, other than I wish my stomach was larger so I would have been able to fit more in. About halfway through our dinner some people started smashing plates, not the ones they ate off. But plates that were handed to them. And then a belly dancer came out, and you could see that at every table (did I mention it was a packed house??) everybody stopped eating and watched. 

When the belly dancer had completed her tour of the restaurant, it seemed like everyone went back to eating. But for those 20 to 30 minutes or whatever the time was, everyone stopped what they were doing and enjoyed a little bit of this tradition."}
{"text":"First and probably last visit to Broken Plate in Willow Park last week. Four of us for reservations at 6:30pm. After we placed our order, 1/2 our party ordered the amazing sounding steak special - we were informed that they had ran out of the special ( it was about 6:45pm on a saturday and they ran out of the special??????  - not a great start)  

Our appetizers came quite quickly, and I must say was the highlight of the evening. we enjoyed the Saganaki (flaming cheese) and the Dolmadas, along with a side of Pita, which I must say was amazing, I could have eaten the home made warm pita all night.

We should have left on a high, if we had only known. Our main course took about an hour, or more after we were finished our appetizers, if we would have known, we would have ordered round two of appetizers. Just before the mains arrived the manager finally came to our table, which we thought was to apologize, and maybe also apologize for the extremely long wait for dinner. Nope he came over to give us this long, un-needed and un-wanted reasoning or as i would call it, excuse for running out of the special. Personally as a paying customer, I do not care why or how you ran out, the fact is it was supper time on a saturday and you were not prepared for your specials. He made it very awkward and uncomfortable, with no real apology, most places would try to rectify the situation or in the very least ensure their customers were being taken care of in every way possible, he was just ruining our evening, we just wanted him to leave us alone.

Our entrees did arrive after he finally moved on to the next table to irritate, my husband and I both had the lamb shank which was ok, slightly bland, the yellow beats were they best part, and they were just steamed veggies. Our companions had the Zeus Chicken and the Greek Ribs, they were not overly impressed either. It was food. it was definitely NOT worth the money, the long wait, and the fact that our meal was made more uncomfortable and unenjoyable by the manager."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to Broken plate and I'm so glad that I came to try it again. Everything we ordered was good. 

Rack of lamb
Lamb chops
stuffed chicken
Moussaka
Saganaki
Calamari

Moist, tender, flavorful, no game-y flavor, dinner plates come with lots of potatoes. You will definitely leave full or even take a doggy bag home.

I would definitely come back for the rack of lamb!
Service was good, though it wasn't like 'chummy' friendly... very professional & distant friendly if that makes sense."}
{"text":"i have eaten here a few times and always found i enjoyed my experience.. This last time i went was almost the same except for one small detail. I always inform my server that I am celiac and things usually go well. Dinner was amazing as usual, sticking to tapas and salad, it wasn't until after i had the dessert that things went down hill for me. 
Dessert tasted amazing, but within an hour i was very sick with Gluten symptoms. I am not sure if maybe there was cross contamination or it was the dessert itself but I reiterate to people to always re-inform your server of your dietary needs.

I will definitely return to eat here as i enjoy greek food and the servers are always fun and friendly.. I will just be sure to ask more questions to ensure my food is safe."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Greek food unless of course it's authentic! That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at Broken Plate. The food was good, portion sizes were above average and what impressed me the most was the fantastic service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Slow service but will do gf. Apps were hit and miss. Cheese AP not melted. Dinner served cold. Not attentive service"}
