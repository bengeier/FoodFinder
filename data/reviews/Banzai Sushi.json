{"text":"I have to say this place Is really hard to find, because the it's  decoration is really hard to know this is sushi restaurant! That's really shame. But what surprise me is that the food is sooooo good!  The fish is pretty fresh and even the rice taste good! And the price is so cheap, what I got this combo(add there are two I had ate) only cost me like 5 dollar! And I have to say the food is out of its price, and it even taste better than some sushi in popular Japanese restaurants.  Also, there are some cute Japanese snacks are selling here, they are so delicious too.  Hope some people can come and try it!"}
{"text":"I have been getting sushi from Banzai Sushi  since it opened about 10 years ago. Sushi is always very consistent and fresh. The owners (who seem to be a couple) are always prepared to make a type of sushi that they may not on display. Just ask! The pricing is very reasonable, $3.50 for 6 pieces of any type of sushi. The sushi pieces are also quite large, which gives you true value for money. 

The owner also sells imported soda from the US, such as Vanilla Coke or Cherry Coke which I love. Overall, I have never had a bad experience here. Very low key, but great, it is always great tasting and FRESH! 

If you are in the area, go in an pick up some sushi, soup or a bento box. You can take it home or eat it at the tables in the area that was once a mall."}
{"text":"I have been had takeout sushi here quite often for several years. Good taste, good price, friendly people!"}
{"text":"I don't listen to my father often when it comes to food. But when he introduced me to this place. I took him a little more seriously in his decisions

I was very skeptical about the whole introduction of this place to me because he never eats sushi in his regular diet. 

That being said I have been very taken with this place and the minimalist offerings that this place has to offer. It also is an ideal place to pick up sushi supplies in one place if you don't like hunting around for sushi supplies in your local supermarket .

It's not top tier sushi but it's damn acceptable! in a pinch!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi, and unbeatable prices! Only downfall is that they are cash only, and close by 7pm"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was in grade 9 so about 10 years now (wow!) staff are very friendly and prices are ridiculously cheap. I remember back in my younger days being short on change and they never cared! Super nice family owned businesses. I always get the California roll, either I grab one out of the fridge or have them make it fresh if there's none. The tofu is also really good! They also sell so many different kinds of pop in a can for a buck and different Asian treats like pocky!"}
