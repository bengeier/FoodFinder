{"text":"This place is amazing. Tiny storefront with lovely service. Ridiculous variety of wing flavours, and I can't wait to try them! So far, I've tried their Town of Jaffna and Malvern Boys (love the local names, by the way), which are spicy and delicious. The Chili Onion Fries are also to die for. They have a \"Malvern Special\" on offer (1 lb. of wings and side of the Chili Onion Fries) which is reasonably priced at $15. Will soon return!"}
{"text":"Finally, a wing spot in Malvern with good prices and an endless variety of wing flavors. Located just right behind Malvern mall, this new joint will easily become a new go-to for locals. The setting is a small space with just bar benches against the window so I opted for take-out. The service was good - ran by young gentlemen who knew their wings. They have two menus: one with all their items and the other which just focuses on the wings and what actually goes into them. I got the MALVERN SPECIAL which comes with 1lb of wings (1 flavor), chili and onion fries and pop for $14.95. The flavor i got was Bumble BBQ (honey garlic bbq) which I loved - a good mix of sweet and bbq and the wings were fairly huge so you're sure to get full. The chili onion fries are one of their staples so if you ever get to go there, try them out. On top of this deal, they have daily specials that are hella affordable ($5-$10)!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Wow Wings location a bit closer to home!

Came here the other night to get a pound of wings and chilli onion fries. The staff were pretty friendly and the service was pretty fast. However, I do recommend that you call in ahead of time and order, in that case you won't have to wait. The wings and chilli onion fries were amazing!! Never a let down. One thing I do suggest would be to double check the bill, because they do have daily specials. 

Definitely recommend this place for take-out, especially for the wings and chilli onion fries. 

P.S. seating is limited, more of a take-out place rather than dine-in."}
