{"text":"Very cool space for mainly locals.  Definitely off the beaten path.  Seems like a warehouse with a bar in the middle.  Then add décor and a couple of pool tables.  The guitar player (I was told was Tommy Rocker, or perhaps after a couple of beers I would have believed anything) played cool classic rock tunes.  The regulars would go up and do an open mic. sing along.  Waitress Andrea was awesome and took care of us.  Easy on the eyes too.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bar. Friendly wait staff. BEST. FRIES. EVER. Beer batter dipped. Ordered them extra crispy. Steve was very nice. Wings were good. Will go back next time in Vegas. For sure."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Alex the bartender was very attentive and super helpful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"food is good but the male bartenders are seriously sooooo rudeee always being rude to customers and waitresses !!! management should really do something about it !!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on the advice of a friend because a band was playing.  Honestly, the service was awesome.  The food...ok.  sliders were really good but the nachos were not good.  Here was our problem.  The band that played.  Ugh.  The music?  Awesome.  The choice of songs?  Awesome.  The singer?  Tragic.  We had to leave.  It was terrible."}
{"text":"You could say I'm a regular here... Brent Clauson saw me for the second time and remembered me and knew exactly what I wanted! Very friendly and was happy to see me and serve me! He was very professional and friendly I highly recommend on his shift Tuesday's and Wednesday's 4pm-12am"}
{"text":"Tommy Rocker is Aces, although his bartenders are horrible playing o cell phones, ignoring customers practically had to beg for a drink. I am writing this at the bar now with an empty glass, bartender two stools away talking to a girl, glass has been empty for 20 minutes. I bartender in Vegas and tip very well. Tommy take notice of the bar, very dissapointed. The three stars are for Tommy a big 0 for the bartenders"}
{"text":"Tommy Rockers has always been a second home to me and my boyfriend. We still make frequent stops, especially to see Bryan on Graveyard. He always makes sure we have the best service. I recommend the wings, chicken nachos and mozzarella sticks!! Thank you as always Bryan : ) Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Great afternoon happy hour watching Oregon Duck football. 1/2 price angus burgers, $3 brewskis!"}
{"text":"Just off the strip and away from downtown, Tommy Rocker's is a must stop for me every time I come to town.   It's a great bar with way better than average food and Katrina is a wonderful bartender.   If Tommy or any number of the musicians in his stable aren't playing, some kind of sports is happening on the dozen TVs.   It's a breath of fresh air in a town that's so high paced and expensive.   Just like all the local businesses here... Tommy Rocker's is Vegas Strong!!"}
{"text":"This is normally a great bar with great service. However due to a recent change, ordering food while at the bar has become awkward to say the least. Bartenders used to take orders, now waitresses do. It takes more time to place order, had one slightly incorrect order, and significantly longer to settle up. Mind you, everyone is still nice, this process has just doesn't flow nicely. Bartenders still have to clear the food & settle anyone comping food. Hopefully it will straighten out or change. I will still continue coming here for drinks because, it is otherwise a great bar."}
{"text":"Back in the day when they first opened (15 years ago?) I loved this place. It was a great place to get lunch, or play some pool in the evening.  I was never around during the \"Strip Club\" days.. so I don't know about that. The last time I was in there I was disappointed in how dirty and smelly the place had gotten.   The waitress was very nice, and I still like the burgers and the Big Ass Burrito  If they cleaned it up a little it could probably be nice again."}
{"text":"Yikes. Went here about a year ago and had a great time and good food. Boy have things really gone downhill for this place. Went last night to use our nearly expiring groupon deal. The place was pretty dead. We looked around for a spot to sit, and decided to grab a booth. Upon sitting realized the seats were filthy and dirty, as well as the table. We were approached by a waitress (the only one) and she also looked to be tending the bar. She was very short with us and UN-friendly. Never smiled or acted polite, was just cold. We ordered our drinks and my wine glass was dirty with lip marks on it. We ordered the queso dip to start, and the chips were all broken and small, pretty much crumbles (maybe it was from the bottom of the bag). Our entrees were very mediocre at best. My boyfriend said the steak in his burrito was nasty and chewy.   I know this place has been around a while, but it needs some major sprucing up and maybe some new management and new employees ( maybe ones that look like they want to serve you, not act like you are a nuisance). They also need to deep clean the place. Its too bad because as recent as a year ago we liked our visit, but things are going south here. They need to make changes asap, or I see it closing down soon."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this restaurant. First off we couldn't play pool because of an overpowering stench coming from that direction. The bartender (a man who works Thursday nights) told us we couldn't sit at the bar to order food. It takes our server a good 15 minutes to come over because she's chatting  with People. She comes over and come to find out she's insanely wasted! Dropping F bombs, drooling on my sisters leg, and being a little too touchy for our liking. It takes like 35 min to get our food. My food was made incorrectly. She profusely apologizes , but I've been sitting here for the last 53 minutes waiting for my replacement. It's not packed at all, I'd understand if it was body to body, but it's not. I had to order in Spanish to the cook myself since our drunk server couldn't. She offered free drinks and said the  owner didn't give a shit about the food or the drinks all we care about are the poker machines. Asked to speak to a manager and was told \"the motherf***er isn't on site.\" Never will I return and it definitely left a bad Vegas taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Ken, our bartender, hates his job and the patrons. He greets you with a smug face and an indifferent attitude. I came with a warning from my friends, already there, I tried to be open about it, thinking maybe something happened between them but no.. it was the same indifferent attitude. I felt bad and tipped him anyway. Maybe the dude just had a bad day or maybe it's why we haven't been there in years because of the service. El Dorado it is."}
{"text":"Today my spouse and I went in for a wake me up cocktail after a long night of travels. We sat at an empty bar 15 mins waiting to be approached . Bartender KEN saw us and ignored us. We sat for a while longer waiting on him as he counted his money  And still we had no service   Avoid coming here at all costs. With several other establishments in the Las Vegas area no wonder ken works at a local gaming bar . His customer service skills mediocre at some are obviously what's hindered him from working at the likes of bellagio, Wynn ect."}
{"text":"Great place to come by after a late night on the strip! This place has a great atmosphere of laid back locals, plenty of space with comfy seating, and interesting 'americana' decor.  I really enjoyed our server and her friendliness to our group! Food was wholesome and delicious. Nice place to catch up with friends and have a drink too."}
{"text":"I liked it better when it was a strip club BUT the food is still VERY good.  I stopped in to kill time between work and a show. The bartenders were friendly and made suggestions. They do not have a robust beer selection, but there are few interesting things on tap. The food prices are a bit high for what you actually get BUT if you like fried bar food (WHO DOESN'T), you will not be disappointed.   This stop was quick. I just got some wings and fries and just one beer and they really took care of my hunger and need for something yummy.  The bar area is not too smokey, but that is something to be aware of if that bothers you.  Be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Tommy Rockers is a classic spot for late at night after you go out. I like to shoot pool here. The menu is average, barely any healthy options besides salad though. The bar service is usually down to earth. They recognize regulars. I think they have karaoke nights here but haven't checked that out yet."}
{"text":"The Shrimp poboy is dynamite, the beer is ice cold. Friendly and caring staff, and Tommy is a entertaining guy to have a conversation with. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"THE WINGS ARE THE BEST EVER!!! I'm not kidding, I think about their wings and boast about their wings every chance I get. You know it's good when you constantly think about the food you had a week ago and you can't wait to go back and have more. Their outstanding! Five stars all the way just talking about it's getting hungry."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't spend a whole lot of time in this place, but after snacking on the food trucks outside, we headed inside for a couple of beers. Most of the beers were $2 or $3, which is pretty great. And there was a live band, which was pretty good. The ambiance is that of a typical 24/7 bar - not much to write home about. But overall, it's not a bad spot."}
{"text":"We came here the other day for a meal after work. We were all so surprised by how good this place was. We had wings and nachos. The food was really great and so was the service. I've been wanting to go back for some more beer and pub food all week."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over the past 5ish years. This review is based off a cumulative of my visits.  It's conveniently located off the strip but close enough so that you can get a bite or drinks if you're near the strip but don't want to be ON the strip.  Service is so-so. The one male bartender I always seem to have has usually been more  helpful than a particular waitress (that's also always there) that never seems to be too happy to be there.  Drinks are pretty good, so that's a plus. Food is good if you're in the mood for bar food that's a bit on the oily and greasy side. Like not always, but sometimes that really hits the spot!  Personally, I like the chips w guac the best. Their guac is delicious and tastes as it should (like ripe, fresh avocados).   One not so great thing is that even for a bar, this place is REALLY smokey.  Overall, it's a decent bar  and I'll continue to pop in now and then when I'm in the area and want drinks or a small bite."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour special! Everyday from 2-7pm draft beers are priced well, and hamburgers and wings are half off if I remember correctly. They've got very friendly staff, but not a lot so please be patient.  Tips: * Come during happy hour 2 - 7pm everyday. Beers are $5, wine $1 off, and their hamburger and wings are half priced. Also their appetizers are $2 off.  * Don't come when it's super busy. They don't staff a lot of people so you'll have to be patient with service.  * Staff is friendly and a good conversation at the bar."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere  daily hh 2-7 .   Alex the waitress / bartender rocks!  Have the shrimp jammers, dip your fries in the Bourbon BBQ sauce, yum.  CONS: smoking in the bar yuck    Have the shrimp jammers, dip your fries in Bourbon BBQ sauce & have"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that the best shrimp poboy outside of Louisiana is here but it's true. Not to mention great LSU football watch games with awesome drink specials, Abita beer from Louisiana and some of the best live music free!"}
{"text":"if you're a night owl like me, Jim and Brian are the cats meow!! oh, and the food and drinks are pretty great too"}
{"text":"Had a small get together at Tommy's and decided to have a drink and an appetizer.  The wife had a rum and coke and I had a coke.  both were good with the rum drink having a more than better shot of rum. We decided to have the guacamole and chips. There was an ample amount of both guacamole and a side of salsa.  Each was very good.  Price was $ 6.99, which is not out of line with other establishments.  The bar and the table areas were clean and the establishment was homey.  service was better than most places.  This was my first time back at Tommy's in a number of years. Since the last time I was in the bar has been cleaned up and the stage moved to a better location. There is a fireplace which gives the place a better atmosphere.  I will go back again next time in twn to try some of the other menu items. .  ."}
{"text":"It was very good food, it just took a while to get it. I had a avacodo bacon burger that was really good. The price is a little high $11.95 but came with a side. Also split wings and they were good as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both for flair bartending competitions. The first time we had a great time, however the bartender wasn't great at giving us service. We would have to wait long intervals before each round. The second time we sat at the tables, ordered drinks and food. Both servers we had, Jenny and Amy, were great. We got the sautéed mushrooms (yum!!) and shrimp jammers (different but good). I'll continue coming back for the flair comps, but not much else."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday service was so so not great not bad.  The food was average I had nachos with chicken, they were light on the jalapeños and on some of the other toppings. Over all the nachos was ok I've had better and worse before. The major negative was the bar/restaurant was so cigarette smoke filled. Based on the cigarette smoke I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The place was really dark, but not so dark you had to use a flashlight to read the menu. Sarah was bartending and she was very pleasant. As soon as people started shuffling in for lunch, and she was the ONLY person on the floor at the time, she was still attentive to us.   One weird thing I noticed was a lady sitting next to the fireplace reading a book...with songs from ACDC and the like playing in the background. Who the hell comes to a dark bar to read a novel?! Very strange. Also, why the hell is there a fireplace?! I got a kick out of that.   I ordered the chicken sandwich and my friend had a burger. It took a while for the food to come out, but once it did, I was happy. The chicken was moist, the bacon crisp and the veggies on it fresh. Ended up taking half to go, and it held up nicely as a midnight snack.   I'll be back, but at a different time of day. I'd like to see some bands play.  But I must say, I felt like a vampire walking out of that place at that time of day..."}
{"text":"tldr  A perfect post nightclub/afterhours spots. Plenty of gambling machines and a pretty impressive food menu. The fries are clutch!  Get: -chicken tenders with BBQ sauce"}
{"text":"Okay get over \"it used to have topless dancer late at night\" thing. It's back to what makes it the best Off Strip Locals Hangout: Music, cold beer, and good people!"}
{"text":"Usually this is my favorite place in the world to eat spinach dip but they took away the breadsticks it ruin the entire thing this is my first review ever on yelp because I'm that upset about it if she brought out the bread and I wanted to throw it across the bar this is ridiculous please bring the breadsticks back I've been coming here for years and I love the breadsticks I love all of it together and now it's shit. These garlic bread's or whatever they are there just disgusting it ruins the whole meal no I have left is I can sit here and drink the spinach dip like a cocktail but I won't even do that because I'm so upset the breadsticks are gone I no everyone else agrees with me on this so let's complain let's fix this I can't deal with this personally I won't deal with this everyone knows we all come here for the spinach dip in the bread sticks"}
{"text":"Horrible breakfast food, Excellent service though, Alex behind the bar early afternoons is the best . Very dark inside, loads of seating,"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Definitely great for groups of friends. Billiards, 20 beers on tap, a rad stage for bands or whatever. A bunch of buddies and I came here after a show and partied it up till the morning. Also, tried one of the best veggie sandwhiches ever, the Mr. Feel Good sandwhich. Like I said, awesome spot. Check it out yall."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening it was pretty empty.  Sat at the bar our server was amazing I forgot her name but she was attentive and friendly.   We ordered the hot wings with fries.  Our order was made in a timely manor.   I must say hands down the best wings and fries I've had near the strip in a long time.   We will definitely be coming back here again.   * don't recommend the Ceasar wrap at all very soggy.   I gave it 4 stars because I think it could have been a little lighter in there. I don't like it to be so dark that  you can barely see what your eating.   Other wise it's a good place to come."}
{"text":"DOESNT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR. I BELIEVE HIS NAME WAS KEN STUPID BARTENDER WAS A PIECE OF SHIT ASSHOLE SO RUDE. Ordered chicken fingers told me I get five open my box and really there's only four in there. I called back and he tells me that it varies on how big they are when all of them were pretty fucking small what a rip off."}
{"text":"Best hot wings in town. Always a good crowd and the beer is always cold. Ask for Rebecca."}
{"text":"This place was great, hidden spot off strip that not too many people know about but definitely worth stopping in for food to get away from the crowds and high prices on the strip  - my 2 visits here were on a recent trip to Las Vegas and it was suggested as a place to go in by a friend who used to be a local here  First stop we came in for lunch on a Friday - service was great sat right at the bar and the burgers were awesome - Good selection of beers on tap and in the bottle   Second visit was for breakfast - again great service - food came out quick and service was great   This place is open 24 hours and can get pretty rockin' on Friday and Saturday nights from what I understand   Big bar inside and plenty of TVs all around as well - definitely worth going in this place when you are in town or a local resident"}
{"text":"This is what happens when you ask a cab driver where to go at 4am on a Friday night after way too many drinks.  The only good thing I can say about Tommy Rocker's is that their fries were surprisingly good.  It's a small venue, but what made this disappointing was the fact that there were more people serving food than dancers.  Take my advice and avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I will start with a confession, I was a frequent yelp user, yet never actually gave my own review untill I visited this place...is it even a strip club!???  I can admit, the previous reviews made me cautious but I took a swing anyway.In summary...it sucks"}
{"text":"Your late night server whom is a guy white to be exact he act liked racist he snatched the menu from us we asked him for a few things and he just looked at us liked we was stupid ! He also was just so rude we didn't even leave a tip I think he really needs to fix his attitude towards black people ! So not cool !"}
{"text":"Tommy rockers is always the place to be after you're done working and can't find one of those places that is open during the day. Not only is it a bar, but it is also a restaurant. Years and years ago used to be a bar, restaurant, and strip club. Just about everybody who knows what it was like when there was a strip club is happy that that portion of the business is now gone.  The bartenders are super nice, though they are sometimes busy and hard to get the attention of. There's always cool events going on at Tommy rockers and some nights it's so busy that it's hard to find a spot, but that's what makes me want to go here-people are actually having fun and hanging out.  There is smoking allowed inside at the bar, and for us non-smokers it can be a bit annoying when you get your food and somebody sits next to you and lights up.  As far as the food goes, their menu is full of choices. It's possible to get healthy food such as the Mr. Feelgood (chicken sandwich). You can also pick out on the typical bar food as well.  Prices are very reasonable, with most things coming in between $7 and $12."}
{"text":"The food is average and the service is okay.  It is really smoky inside and that takes away from the experience."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, this place rocked.....always packed with people and had a great vibe.  Then, inexplicably, it became a topless strip club....wth?  Where were all the partiers who wanted to sing along with Tommy and his band go?  Who knows.  Now, it's no longer a topless strip club, but it's lost the momentum it once had.  Which is too bad because it was a really fun place to go to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, shoot some pool, have some food, and sing along with the band.  Well, not really sing along, but the bands were so much fun (think Jimmy Buffet style) that you couldn't help but sing along with your drunk friends.  I recently stopped by the joint to see what it was like now.  I walked into the place and it just didn't feel the same.  It's the same building and not much as changed inside the bar, but it was missing the people that made it fun.  It was replaced with other people, but it just didn't seem right.  I had a Beer and left.  Despite losing it's luster and momentum, this place is one of the best places to be during a weekend that Jimmy Buffet is performing in Vegas.  Although Jimmy has opened up a joint at the Flamingo, many Parrot Heads still come here.  Before Margaritaville opened up, this was Parrot Head heaven during those weekends.  Will I return?  Only during a Jimmy Buffet concert weekend."}
{"text":"So, yes.  This is a topless club.  However, during the hours that I was in attendance, there was no toplessness in the club.  We came in for lunch at about 1pm not specifically looking for the topless aspect, but really for the food.  It was close, and affordable.  So reviewing the food, it is great!  We had the spinach artichoke dip which was served with this warm bread that melts in your mouth!  It was great.  The chips served with it as well were light, cripsy and full of flavor.  It' went well with the dip.  I also ordred the fish n chips.  4 very large portions of fish and some fries (chips) on the side - with some coleslaw.  Everything was great.  The fish was warm and flaky, and did not tasty fishy at all - the batter they use holds a lot of flavor as well.  Check em out - even if just for the food."}
{"text":"I live at panorama towers and I've probably driven by this place 500 times I had never been in knew nothing about it but then yesterday I got a flyer in the mail it's a free appetizer so I popped in Bruce was behind the bar super nice guy had a fabulous quesadilla for free so of course you know it taste better and the lettuce wedge salad which was damn good looks like this place has reasonable prices so I will definitely be back and being someone that went to high school in the 80s the music was perfect love the rock 'n' roll"}
{"text":"Been going there for 20years. This morning had to be the worst experience ever. Food was made horrible and had to wait a while for the bartender to finish talking to her friends to get check. This place used to be on point.  I hope this was just a one time thing."}
{"text":"Extra star because they have vegan options. I get the mr feel good sandwhich and I just have to omit a couple things.. I don't remember what exactly but their fries are freakin bomb dot com and the fact that there's sprouts on that sangwhich makes my heart flutter, it's s good spot to go to when it's late & a nice spot to just chill and drink. They have pool. Nice lil chill spot."}
{"text":"I was in the Dean Martin location area for business around lunch time so I decided to stop in for a burger. I forget the exact name of the burger I ordered but it was cajun flavored and smothered in peppers. A very good burger I would highly recommend over the usual bar burger."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable, the food is amazing and the drinks are well worth the price. This place was recommended to us by our Lyft driver and it was spot on. Couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"First of all we had an amazing livingsocial voucher, so for value wise our experience was a 5 stars. But for everyone else would we recommend this place? First of all there was only 1 bartender, who told us she was the only one working like 10 times, but she was sweet. I had a Philly Cheese steak and fries and it was excellent and only $9. My girl friends burger was hand made and grilled to perfection and the onion rings were great. My bloody Mary was awful, really, how can you mess one up, but it was bad. As people came in for lunch the bartender became more panicked, again, she was sweet. The management should have an assistant at all times, especially because some people want to eat and not just drink. This location is hard to get to and not very convenient, but it appears to be a place where locals would have a good time at. Would I go back? With a coupon or voucher, he'll yes."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese with bacon is so good. The club sandwich is good too. The service has been really slow both times I went here and it seems like they only have one person in the kitchen. Great food, you just might not want to go during your lunch break"}
{"text":"I go to Tommy Rocker's to watch college football with LSU.  The crowd is great, the service is great, the food is great - we always have fun there!"}
{"text":"Went here to watch civil  war game with family.  We ordered wings and fries, brother ordered single taco.  Our wings came no fries said where's fries she says cook said they don't come with fries and then went and gets menu and said oh yeah it's said it comes with fries so she beings fries. She finally comes back we ask where are tacos she said i forgot to put in order...mind you this is 45 minutes later.  We ask again 25 minutes after that she said oh bar got a big order they ate working on your 2 tacos....finally another 10 minutes and she brings 2 tacos...yes wait for picture...you might thin lthink they were gourmet after an Hour wait..NOT EVEN CLOSE"}
{"text":"This being my first time here, I came for the food trucks in the parking lot. The bartenders were very efficient and fast. Not personable but it was a very busy night. There was a humane society benefit with a raffle and women in costumes. Bar was pretty packed but it seemed an average local bar. I will return to try the food, I hope it doesn't negatively effect my review as the wings served looked terrible."}
{"text":"The bar is big and all the tables are set up in one general area so that you are facing the giant TV for football.  There is also a stage so I assume they have concerts in there on some nights.  I met up with friends to grab a bite and watch a little football.  It seem to be a Dolphins bar as all 20 people in the bar were decked out in Miami Dolphins gear.  Our server was fine the entire time, but when it came time to get the check, she was nowhere in sight.  After we asked for the check, it took her forever to bring it, and then AGAIN it took forever for her process my card and bring the receipt back.   I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and only got a cheeseburger, and on a scale of 1-10, it was maybe a 4.5.  Not the best burger I've ever had.  The onion rings however, were spectacular.  Crunchy breading and thick delicious deep fried onions on the inside.  Just perfect.  My friends ordered and array of bar snacks, which they seemed to enjoy.  Overall an ok place to go to watch football as it's not very crowded and it's close to where our friends live."}
{"text":"I could've sworn this use to be a Topless Bar?!  Before you read my 3 star disclaimer, i just want to say Big Ups to the professional staff and their service.  Most def a five star rating for their friendliness and being so attentive to their customers which is something you don't see in most Dive bars.  So why 3 stars?  The place is lacking, Tommy just wasn't Rockin'!  I could smell Death's stench within these four walls.. no life to the party.  I understand the quiet bars n all.. but it seems as if this place was designed and \"named\" to Burn the Roof!  and it's not like I came on a slow night.. I dropped in on both friday and saturday nights. If I were to compare, it would be TGIFriday's minus the Friday.. more like TGIWednesday's.  Among the other reviewers, it was said that Tommy's was once a Well of Rock but somehow fell off the charts.  I sure do hope one day a Rabbi, a Priest and a Minister walk into this bar for some Revival.. and even circumcision!"}
{"text":"Stopped by there last night (Saturday) around 7:30PM just to check the place out & get some food, and had so much fun that I stayed until 12:30AM, when I was getting sleepy.    Good atmosphere -- nothing stuffy or pretentious, and I was pleasantly surprised that not only were the staff friendly, but the clientele was too.     There was an band there called Face First, playing lots of great, popular songs from the 1980s.  They were walking around talking to people in-between sets & it turns out they were friends attending UNLV in the 1980s that formed a band, did some touring throughout the 1980s, then went on with their lives, & were back doing a reunion that night.  Sounds like a possible horror-story, but they were very good at covering popular 80s songs but with their own 'sound,' instead of just trying to completely emulate other bands.  The proprietor, Tommy Rocker, was making the rounds & he's quite a character.  It's amazing what lyrics to obscure songs he knows (ask him about Johnny Cash's Live at Folsom).   It's always cool to hang out a little with the owner of the place & thanks to good staff, he can afford to focus on ensuring the customers are having a good time instead of having to supervise the staff. Unfortunately, we didn't get the opportunity to hear him sing (his era is 1970s) but that's a good reason for me to get back there.    Ventilation could have been a little better, especially around 10-11PM when the place was pretty busy (but not so full of people that you couldn't walk around), but I mostly say that because of one jackass sitting at the bar smoking a cigar.  I'm a non-smoker that definitely hates smoke, but other than the guy sucking his phallic cigar, the air wasn't too bad.  You're in a bar in LV so you gotta just deal with it.  I did take a shower to get the stench off me when I got home.  I just had a couple Pepsi's, and Mozzarella Sticks plus Spinach Dip appetizers.  The food items tasted great, and the sauces they came with were fresh.   Our total bill was only $19 something, and they had no problem running a tab.     If you're looking for a relaxed, fun hangout close to the LV Strip with good food & music, some pool tables (at least 2, maybe 3?) and NOT the hipster nightclub crowd, Tommy Rocker's is a great choice.    I live in Henderson, where they have their second location, and I'm very curious as to what that one is like so I will probably stop by it soon just to check it out."}
{"text":"Bartender lady must have been drunk or on drugs. Came in for a sandwich and never got it, asked for a water bottle and never got it. The place wasn't even full for her to have forgotten to put the order in."}
{"text":"We just had the worst experience at this place. It had become our go to place for lunch nearby the office. But, the service has drastically changed. If Rachel is there you are good, she is fantastic. But, they hired a new server, Dawn, who is not friendly and does not provide the service we have become used to. This time I ordered my usual Patty Melt and told her exactly what I wanted. When she brought the food out it was a Tuna Melt. She immediately said \"that is the way it comes\" and went to get a menu. When she returned I showed her what I ordered and she took the Tuna melt back. By the time I got my food I had to shove it down my throat quickly because I had a meeting to get to and the extra time it took for them to cook the new meal. Then when she came to bring the check her response was, well I gave you a 25% discount so we are all good.\" The discount is not the issue, it was her attitude, she seemed to want to tell us when we should feel like everything is okay, She was not personable and certainly did not know how to provide good customer service. Kait who I mentioned in my last review no longer works there. So, it seems they are changing out those who provide good customer service with those who do not. Again, Rachel is great, but we have not had as much luck with the rest of the staff, specifically Dawn."}
{"text":"This is a bar style restaurant. If you go during the day expect to wait a while.  The waitresses are running around like crazy, so getting some personal attention is kind of hard. We put up peace flags and smoke signals. :)  The food is okay. Had a wrap that wasn't bad on the way down, but later upset the tummy.. My friend had the tuna melt, and wasn't happy at all. But  I have heard that dinner gets much better. So that's that... Acceptable, but not recommendable."}
{"text":"The late night male server behind the bar is rude asf! Always has an attitude, doesn't speak, not good service what so ever! This is the second time we have been here and he has remained the same! Not sure if he likes his job or not but is service is terrible! Great food though!"}
{"text":"It wasn't great they charge extra for wacamole (nachos) and extra to add Chiken or beef wich doesn't make sense that's like charging you for cheese to put on a quesadilla, nachos are automatically supposed to come with wacamole and beef so that's super shady or cheap not to mention the sauce was super watered down, every time I dipped the nachos on the sauce nothing but water came out #superfkngrooosss!"}
{"text":"I didn't think my previous experience at Tommy Rocker's could be improved, but damn if it wasn't -- thanks to bartenders Alex & Anthony.  Warm and welcoming, they treated me like a whale while I enjoyed a little video blackjack, ice cold craft beers and phenomenal chicken wings.  They were generous with the comps -- and the laughs.  What a great place!"}
{"text":"I really like the ribs and shrimp jammers at this locale.  Full rack of ribs is enough for two meals,  Shrimp jammers are jalapeños filled with shrimp, cheese, breaded and fried Not health food, definitely yummy  Bartenders are always friendly. HH drinks are good   The Henderson locale has a very different menu, not bad but different."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, one of the best burgers I've ever had. Completely impressed. On the flip side the nachos were fairly lame. Our waitress, Carrie, was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and very very helpful and selection. The band tonight is Band company. A bad company cover band. Also very good."}
{"text":"Ordered the basic nachos with a table of 9. They forgot the order. Everybody else are while they stated the basic nachos without meat took longer. Really?! Not very efficient or responsible. They are definitely not very attentive. We've been the only table at Tommy Rockers early Friday night."}
{"text":"I was highly surprised by how good the food was. It does come off as being an oversized dive bar, but I'm cool with that. We went in on a Saturday in between lunch & dinner & we were the only ones eating! I ordered a veggie sandwich which was yummy & my husband's fish tacos were just as good. Our server was extremely friendly & made sure our visit was a great one. If you're looking for an unpacked local friendly bar/restaurant with no wait time & great prices, this should be your stop when in Vegas (we used a groupon & are from Cali) We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We were hungry and decided to give this place a chance. Some of our friends musicians played there a couple of times and said it was very good.   I got a beef quesadilla and wasn't disappointed! The dish was huge and really yummy. The place was a little empty, but I think it is because we went there in a strange time. I would want to Caine back and check it out at night. It looks like it might be a cool place to hang out with the friends."}
{"text":"I purchased the Groupon for this place when it became available. Despite the good deal, I didn't have high expectations for this place.   We came here this evening and decided to share several appetizers and a we each got a drink. The prices were pretty good. We shared buffalo wings, nachos with chicken and some sliders. Our waitress was beyond amazing. I was really impressed by how personable and attentive. She was friendly and always made sure our drinks were filled and had everything we needed.   The food was surprisingly good as well. It wasn't gourmet by any stretch of the imagination was it was very tasty and affordable. I look forward to coming here again for some affordable drinks and grub. Their happy hour specials look really good as well and they last until 7 daily."}
