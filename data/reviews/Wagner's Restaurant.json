{"text":"Best country kitchen around. Great food and great service. Food homemade. The best Rueben money can buy."}
{"text":"Love the small town atmosphere and great food! My husband and I had the Philly and it had enough of everything meat, peppers and onions. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Can't get a better breakfast than Wagners! Friendly, attentive staff. Very clean restaurant. Delicious potato soup, great seafood and they even make a good pizza! There's something for everyone here. The owner makes homemade pies and cupcakes. The best banana cream pie you can get! This place offers a comfortable down home country atmosphere, with fast service. We've been coming here once a week for 8 years. You have to try them, you won't be disappointed. Tables and booth seating available. Ample parking. An absolute diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Breakfast is good. Servers polite. For the prices on lunch/dinner items I would have expected homemade as opposed to frozen patties, frozen fries, and turkey cold cuts in place of fresh. Despite political differences, as a business owner, I wouldn't openly post my political views onto my clients at my business."}
{"text":"We happened to come across this place by accident. It was breakfast time. We ordered ham & cheese omelets with sides of potatoes and pancakes. The coffee was piping hot but instantly drinkable. Every bit of food was fabulous as was the service. If the waitress was busy someone was there to top off our coffee. Lots of parking & eating areas. I highly recommend this restaurant for the breakfast. Oh and the prices were great also. I'd assume lunch-dinner is delicious also."}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming staff. I stopped with my 3 year old neice and 1 year old nephew for breakfast. The waitress(es) were so nice to both of them. Letting ny neice order for herself (with doubling checking with mom), and gawking over the baby. Very nice family atmosphere!

I had the eggs benedict for breakfast (and so did 3 other people I was with, it's a family favorite!) It was delicious! They were very busy but the food came quickly! 
We got brownie cookies when we left; delicious! 
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A nice local breakfast nook.  Stuff isn't freshly made- prepared in advance. Ok for bacon and potatoes but eggs were dry."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and delicious food!! Whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner, I always enjoy everything I have ever eaten here!!!"}
{"text":"Simple, Affordable, And Clean.  Great Service, No Waiting.  This Is Our \"Go To Spot\" They Also Have The Best Tuna Melt Around, And Trust Me I've Had Enough To Know A Good One!!"}
{"text":"Been twice. Eggs first time around were chopped not scrambled. Coffee was great. Staff very attentive. I would have given four stars, if the manager had not \"stood by her cooks crappy eggs\". We dined there some time ago, everytime i drive by i recall those shitty eggs.\" I dont recall the eggs second time around being awful but then again i ordered sunny side this time and avoided those choped not scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"Cute place, great food. I will take Wagner's over a chain restaurant any day!"}
{"text":"Horrible choice of places to stop and eat lunch. I ordered a steak salad for lunch they brought it out and it was a bowl full of brown lettuce. I was on lunch break no time to order something else. Told the waitress and i didnt get anything in return. First time and the last time."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. We came here last year and had a horrible experience but decided to give it another chance. Big mistake! Nobody should ever have to wait 20-25 minutes after being seated to just receive drinks. It wasn't even crowded. The waitress was not very nice at all and the food wasn't good. Will not be back!"}
