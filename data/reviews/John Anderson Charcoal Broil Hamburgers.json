{"text":"The price is very affordable, but the food is ok.. the fries were great, but by the time I got to the burger the buns were very soggy. I would probably eat here again but not anytime soon. Perhaps I shall try something different."}
{"text":"Not bad burger over all. It has that retro burger taste. The price is fair the decore looks like early 80's when it last seen paint or any change but the place is clean."}
{"text":"I find myself back here often. Three souvlaki on a bun please. Make that to go. One for me, one for my son and one for the dog.  Yup the puppy has developed a taste for this place and loves it as much as I do.  I've been coming here for thirty years so it's one of the only places I never get tired of.  Everything here seems to be good.  The steak sandwich is another favorite, and my son always loves a good burger and fries.  However when the puppy is with us, we will sit in the car and have the chicken souvlaki because all species like chicken souvlaki at John Andersons"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time today for breakfast. We got two specials and two drinks. Besides us, there was only one other person. The food was ready in about 5 minutes, which I actually consider to be a slightly above average wait time since we were the only customers.  We both got the special breakfast that came with potatoes, sausage, eggs and toast. Eggs had no flavor, but nothing a dash of salt couldn't fix. The potatoes and sausage were very similar to the kind you buy frozen from Freshco. Not BAD tasting, but definitely not something outstanding.   Overall, I thought the food was very average tasting. Exactly what you'd expect walking into the restaurant. I might just re-visit some time. :)"}
{"text":"Had that hamburger combo.  Not a bad price and filling but wasn't the greatest quality. Fries were below average and the burger tasted closer to frozen burgers you'd  buy at the grocery store. Also the pop was.pretty small.  Good for a quick bite"}
{"text":"I went here the other day for lunch during a day of work.  My friend and I always pass by here and we never tried it out, so we finally gave it a go.  This place has a sort of old school diner type of vibe to it, although not in the greatest way.  It looks pretty cool but it could also use some renovations to bring it up to par with other places that are trying to go for the old time look.    The service at this place was fairly quick, although maybe it was because nobody else was getting served while my friend and I were there. I ordered the half pound hungry man burger with a side of fries and a drink.  The total was around $11, not too pricey at all.  The burger itself was quite large, although the actual taste was sort of just average, maybe slightly better than average but nothing more than that.  The fries were very bland, so much so that I had to drench them in vinegar just to give them some flavor.  Overall, this place wasn't horrible but it also doesn't stand out at all, so it gets 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if u wanna get souvlaki dinners, they're huge, yummy and fresh. The freshest Greek salad I have ever eaten. It's kinda Like a burger joint with souvlakis. The owners before used to be Greek, now the owners are Asian but are very friendly. place isn't that big and kind of old fashioned 90's feel to it, in it's own special way tho. I come here alot ever since I was small because I used to live around this area. Anywhoo...great place."}
{"text":"Growing up in a small town has made me a fan of retro diner places, especially since I don't see too many around anymore. I like the feeling and look of this 80's, family-run restaurant. Order at the front, pick up your tray when your food is ready, seat yourself.  From the light fixures to the seats, it's like stepping into a restaurant from back in the day, and I mean that in a good way! The couple who own this establishment are so sweet and appreciative of their customers. Lots of items to choose from for more than reasonable prices. Go for the fish and chips or souvlaki on a bun!"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this place. I grew up around the corner almost 30 years ago and this place had already been there. It's not the same owners but as far as I can tell, the same asian family has owned it for a while. Since then the menu has gotten huge. Whether you feel like burgers, fish and chips, just fish, all day breakfast, soups salads, etc...I strongly recommend the DELICIOUS souvlaki's. Quite possibly my favorite souvlaki anywhere, maybe it's the tzaziki sauce, i dunno, but it's absolutely perfect. They even have a do it yourself topping section.   Honestly, this place deserves major props for a fast-food joint."}
{"text":"It seems every place that holds a piece of my boyfriends heart is very questionable on my books. He's been talking about going to John Anderson's for years. So we finally went.   Now, I know this is not a place for me. We both got burgers, seemingly the simplest item on the menu. They came out fairly quickly, but i wasn't impressed. This is after 10 minutes of watching the lady behind the counter go back and forth from food handling to cash handling with no gloves or washing in between. This is a huge pet peeve of mine.  The only reason I ended up eating the burger was because my boyfriend paid for it and I felt bad. But for $20 for the 2 burger combos we could have gone to McDonald's and been assured they were at least wearing gloves."}
