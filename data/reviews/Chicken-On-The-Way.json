{"text":"YUCK!!!!!!! Gross! Me! Out! You call this food????!!!! How are there so many good reviews for this place/stuff! How do the customers and people working at this place consider what they serve to be food?! Edible food yet??!! Everything was brown and overcooked. The kitchen looked filthy, the people working there were all wearing dirty clothes. Yuck!? They were pre-occupied chatting with each other than serving customers. Overpriced, overused cooking oil, the fries were soggy, strange meatless pieces of chicken. Blach .... once was more than enough!! Been there done that and wish I hadn't!"}
{"text":"If grease was a place, chicken on the way would win. Everything is greasy. It's not the best chicken but still edible. I mean for the price you pay, it's not exactly a steal.    The reason this has a whopping 2 stars is because of the service. The young adult who worked there had some sass. I mean I'm good with sass, like you do you but the lady at the counter was full on sassy. I ordered and said wait before finalizing my order  because I wanted corn fritters but I couldn't see. She rolled her eyes and and gave me a smug look. I also got a drink and she full on said \" are you finally done\" and rolled her eyes again. I get it I'm annoying but please make it less obvious.  The food was GREASY and the fries was soggy and gross. The chicken was pretty good but not as good as other places. I must say that the corn fritter was the highlight. It was yummy and very delicious.  I might come back but I think that you should try it and see it yourself because you could have a different experience but expect a greasy visit  ( give me a dollar for how much I talked about it being greasy )"}
{"text":"I've come to realize that my enjoyment of Chicken-On-The-Way is directly correlated to my level of inebriation - the drunker I am, the more delicious it tastes!  That's not a sterling endorsement, I realize, as the person who's judgement improves with intoxication is a rare bird indeed!  Chicken-On-The-Way serves up a somewhat greasy, fully cooked bird, fortunately. In the sober, harsh light of the day, I'd have to say it's just \"alright\".  The fries are actually superior to the chicken, in my estimation.  As for the corn fritters, well let's just say, if you dig on deep-fried batter balls, you'll positively love them.  That being said, this take-out chicken shack is a Calgary tradition, and the food is served up fast and at reasonable prices.  The only problem with the place is that they left the last part of their name off - it should be called \"Chicken-On-The-Way-Home-After-Getting-Loaded\". That kind of truth would certainly bump them up a star!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken. .been coming here since 1986 can be a litte greasy but we don't eat all the skin anyway. , not good for you. .its less salty than KFC ..Fast service. .nicely wrapped to keep hot in a box and brown paper. . Corn fritters can be very good when they're fresh. . Sometimes they cook ahead and then re fry them. .not so good when you know how good they can be. . Fries a litte soft but good with their gravy and coleslaw good.  Nice to see a restaurant be around so long and not change.  One change though is the poor rooster mascot out front. He used to be white. .our favorite then sabotaged pink pesto bismsl pink not funny. Now it's kind of got blackish  highlights all over no likey pls turn him white and hire chicken hawk to guard him.  If you're late 40s 50 60, s you'll know the cartoon lol"}
{"text":"The greasiest fried chicken you will ever eat. Perfect to pick up a box for a beer night with your friends, or if you're nursing a hangover. The best part for me is always the corn fritters (there are actual kernels of corn in them... who knew?). Keep in mind, this is not meant to be gourmet stuff. This is another one of those \"Calgary experiences\".   I always kind of wonder though... what kind of person works here? Why did they paint the giant chicken fluorescent pink?  And most importantly... why can't I get the smell of this stuff out of my clothes?"}
{"text":"Yes. Time for the Yardbird suite. Try to go when it's busy. Most defintely fresh times! Great yardbird, top fries -- although it should be noted that a friend of mine notices CoW has been using potatoes with a higher sugar content recently, they black up as a result --  Which I prefer personally. Gravy tastes like chicken gravy. Really good chicken gravy. Well worth the trip. Go with bulk chuck orders w/no sides for you-and-a-few, or try an Our Specialty, or the Hungry Man.  Only other fried bird of note in this town is to be found in a few Chinese shops. Chinatown's got some fine fried-up bird. Trust me. Good times will be had if you go to there."}
{"text":"There was a long wait on my last visit. Longer for me as several people who ordered after me got their food first for some reason. When I asked why some rude kid bagging the food said \"yours is right there\" as if that was the answer to my question. My gravy was not in the bag.the next day I called and some dumb girl said \"if you don't call that day we can't help you\". Talk about ridiculous. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Okay so this isn't a review, a remembrance of times past ( during university a million years ago, graduated in 1990), a roommate worked at COTW and brought food home every night - my mouth is drooling thinking of the corn fritters dipped in honey and the gorgeously crisp fried chicken that KFC could never hold a candle to (and nothing ever tastes better than free food). Since then have only been there once about ten years ago for a picnic in the wading park at Riley Park and relived old memories. It's just located in an awkward part of the city for us but maybe its time to go out of our way and once again relive those mouth watering memories."}
{"text":"Years and years ago, I once manned a full-blown chicken joint that brought in every manner of person to gobble down the greased chicken pieces. It was really more of a convenience store that sold chicken, but the people went nuts for that shit. It baffled the mind. The slogan I came up with for it was this: \"There are hundreds of places to get chicken in this town; this place is one of them\".  Some of the faithful took exception to that statement one night, but it was true and their arguments had no merit. It WAS one of a hundred places to eat chicken and I'm thinking that motto could be adopted here.  The chicken is alright; no more, no less. It's deep-fried chicken the way it was meant to be cooked. But it's not the best in all the land. The corn fritters are literally balls of grease and batter, like the stuff they undoubtedly clean out of the fryers at the end of every night. The gravy is okay, too. I like the limited menu (just chicken, fries and fritters) and their fries are delicious. But understand despite the history, despite that giant bird out front, despite the long line-ups, Chicken On The Way is one of hundreds of places to get chicken in this town."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that have I  known that there was going to be a huge- grotesque chicken statue guarding the store, I would have picked KFC over it.  My appetite never returned since...   As for the fried chicken, I agree with the fellow yelpers that it was greasy. In addition, it smelled a bit 'raw-chickeny' for me (I know there is no such word but no other word can sufficiently describe what that piece of chicken was like).    Well... here's a bit of optimism for my closing - at least I can now say,  'been there, done that'."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is one of my favourite meals, and my husband loves it, so we probably swing by for takeout here more than I would care to admit...  We typically order chicken and maybe corn fritters.  I hate the fries. Sorry, but I find them mushy, tasteless and unnecessary. I like the chicken because it is crispy, juicy, and not too salty - although maybe they could dial it down a notch.  The fritters are for eating in the car on the way home while your tummy growls or dip in honey or syrup for dessert.    We always order extra chicken in the hopes that we'll have leftovers, but sometimes we can't restrain ourselves and we just go for it.    Food:  Chicken 7/10 Service: Usually fast Atmosphere: old school takeout  Question: Is it possible to smell fried chicken and not drool?"}
{"text":"This place is, how shall we say! um not good, but not bad.  I have had better this is true, but i have also had worse the crazy part is THIS WAS AT THE SAME DARN PLACE.  I'm not sure what goes on in this place, interms of consistancy. First time i went here was with a few friends and the food was AMAZING. The chicken was cooked perfect, The fries were bloody great, the little ball things, were sweet and just right. Bloody good meal.  THEN (dum dum daaaaaaa) I got back around a month or 2 later and Holy Sh*t Chicken was not deep fried it was cooked by the bloody sun! the fries were like left overs that were from 6 afternoons ago, but not the good type (the type that was not lucky enough to be pick up right and slipped to the side of the fryer and left to kinda dry up and turn some strange color and have a very unique flavor) those little ball things that i loved so much before, well $220 later and a dentist saying what did you eat..(enough said)  I'm an honest open kinda guy, maybe it was just a bad day....(NOPE) i have since been back a few times usually after a little visit from a little drink. All i can say is the up and down of the quality is not good...  Either keep it crap or keep it good..JUST KEEP IT"}
{"text":"Like it. I am bias because I grew up eating rotisserie chicken (Benny BBQ, St. Hubert). I really like the corn fritters that come with a meal. Tons of fries. Chicken is good. For fast-food/fried chicken you get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went there at 10 o'clock on a Tuesday night chicken was fresh, delicious,  muffin things were outstanding, and the fries were great to o everything great"}
{"text":"Great Fried chicken for sure, better than you know who. What you receive for what you pay for is definitely a good deal. Fast service too. The only negative thing I have to say is sometimes their fries are under cooked and kind of wrecks it. But, I always go back."}
{"text":"Deep Fried Feathers.  Loved to go here for my Corn Fritter fix, but was completely turned off by the three pieces of chicken with feathers still attached. It's a small detail, but I guess I don't like my feathers served that way."}
{"text":"To call what i received when i paid for legs is a crime, 3 \"legs\" could not have had more than a quarter pound between the three.  The gravy was like a plain slightly flavored soup, the coleslaw was generic.  I will say the shrimp were big and i actually received one extra, but the sauce was a pale comparison to any cocktail sauce i have tried.  On the plus side the staff were very nice."}
{"text":"Good chicken.  I wish they had seating.  Oh well.  The fries more on the soggy side, but I like them."}
{"text":"This place really is quite decent. It's not 5 star fried chicken. It's simply the only fried chicken joint in calgary. And it's been around a while, so people start deducing that it is therefore the best. Which is silly.   If you've ever had fried chickin in the USA and then you come to C O W, you may concur that this place is missing something. You got a place like Frenchy's, and it's delicious because it's good chicken, cooked properly, in good friers, seasoned nicely, AND THEY DON'T SERVE IT TO YOU STRAIGHT OUT OF THE FRIER. COW has all of that, except the last two. It's not seasoned very well. There isn't really any seasoning. I don't know what they're going for. It's just breading and salt. It's not gross, but it's not savory or fun. It's too salty. There's not much else. And they serve it way too hot. Leaving it on foil or under a lamp actually helps not only in mitigating burning the roof of my mouth, but for locking in tha flavah. \"Well why don't you just let the chicken cool yourself, Cornelious?\". Well I can't. I live in the first world, I buy bottled water just 'cause/like an idiot, and I can't wait 10 minutes when decent fried chicken can be consumed by myself. But I swear, heat lamps do something to the chicken.  Corn fritters = amazing. Fries = very decent.   Worth checking out if you got a hankering, but if you want the best, hit up some Chinese Food Restaurants. They do fried chicken really well. For some reason.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is my second love (next to bacon of course!) so whenever I have the opportunity to indulge in fast food I always opt for deep fried poultry.  This location is the original Chicken on the Way (I've noticed a few have cropped up in different quadrants of the city) and although it's not actually \"on the way\" for me, I'll still go the distance to come here.  Set up cafeteria style, you line up and shuffle down to place your order. I usually go with the Snack Pac ($7.50 for 2 delicious pieces of chicken, served with freshly cut fries and a corn fritter) and always a side of gravy (chicken gravy is THE BEST!)  If it's nice out and you're lucky, you can snag a seat at one of the two picnic tables set up by the side of building and soak in the sun while you eat. Otherwise, don't be afraid to eat in your car because most likely you won't be the only one doing it lol  Try this place if you already haven't, I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Closed 10min early on me. As I pulled up the girl in photo ran to door and locked it on me. closing 10min early is BS. pulled up at 7:50pm when doors were locked on me. Time I was done knocking on window, talking to her, Getting back to my vehicle, singing into yelp, writing a review & photo clock was 7:56pm."}
{"text":"A Calgary classic.  There is just something about this place, it seems to come pre-ordained with nostalgic feelings of warm summer days and memories of gatherings with family and friends. And the \"cock\" related jokes never seem to get old.   Take away from chicken on the way is ideal for picnics and back yard gatherings.The eats are good, and you can beat local farm fresh chicken - which makes this place leaps and bounds beyond the rest. People love the corn fritters, they are good but for me it's all about the fried chicken. The staff here have the process down to an art and can seem to handle the longest lines in record time - and the eats are always fresh.  Keeping it simple is key at chicken on the way and it's no wonder this place is a Calgary landmark."}
{"text":"This is a busy place that's always a good sign.  The wait to get my food was about 10 mins for fresh batch.  The chicken was seemed really dark, like it was over fried crispy and dry.  It was way too greasy for my taste.  I was little disappointed as I was see so many good reviews. Are they having an off day or is the chicken always fried really crispy?  I rate fried chicken that's well fried but golden with great seasoning and juicy on the inside not dry.  That's my take on this.  I may give it one more try since their are so many good reviews but I hesitate as good Resturant always have consistency."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is one of those things that contains every necessary element in really good comfort food. I love the experience of biting into a piece of freshly fried chicken, the sound and feel of the crispy skin, yielding its savoury bounty of tender, juicy meat with the perfect proportion of fat to lean. It's heavenly and soul warming.  That said, there are not a lot of places to get good fried chicken in Calgary. The Colonel? no. Mary Brown? meh. Good fried chicken isn't solely based on the seasonings you use. The texture of the skin is integral, and Chicken-On-The-Way cooks it up with skill.   This Calgary landmark, has been my favourite choice for fried chicken since forever. The seasoning is subtle, focusing on the flavour of the meat. Like I mentioned at the beginning, the skin is crispy and full of that wonderful savoury flavour. Unlike other places, the white meat is juicy, a pleasure to eat as you gently tear off the tender strips.  Their fries, on the other hand, are sadly not as good as the chicken. They are soggy, lacking the crispness that you get in the chicken and corn fritters. I am also not a fan of the gravy. It's pale and lacklustre compared to the rest of the show.   All that aside, it's a very solid and tasty chicken product, and that's all that matters to me. If you do get the chicken, opt for corn fritters instead of fries and get a side of honey. Better yet, get the chicken and honey - and go get some good waffles and be a very happy person."}
{"text":"I've lost count of how many times I've been to Chicken on the Way. It's the best fried chicken I think I've ever had. Seriously. I don't know how they do it but it's worth the trip across the city. And their corn fritters are amazing too.   It's a tiny little place and when it gets busy, look out. The line will be out the door and the parking lot a hopping. The counter staff is always friendly and you never really have to wait long for your order. They take your order and yell it back to the people doing the cooking. They hand cut all their fries which leaves some of the skins on. Gotta love that. You get a huge helping of fries in your box along with chicken and don't forget to get some extra corn fritters. Yes, it's totally fattening but hey, just don't go eating here every day. Watch out because the chicken will be hot. It's so tender and the coating is crispy and a has nice flavor. When your order is ready, they wrap the box all up in brown paper. It's like a step back in time. It's a total treat all the way around.  Chicken on the Way is a Calgary classic. If you haven't tried it, you really should."}
{"text":"There are actually plenty of good things going on here -- the service was friendly and fast, the price was right, and I enjoyed the fries quite a lot.  But none of that made up for the chicken, which I found a bit bland and too crispy.  I'm glad that this place is around and that a lot of people love it, but the two star Yelp text of \"Meh. I've experienced better\" really fits for me."}
{"text":"Expect very big portions but the food is very greasy. Prices are decent $8,50 for 2 pieces of fish and chips. Probably good for hungover"}
{"text":"So.... What's the hype? Over salty and overcooked fried chicken? My chicken was not that good at all.... Where are the spices? Smallest drumstick in the world too, what gives? I did enjoy the gravy and corn fritter but that's kind of sad when I enjoyed those more than the chicken. Fries? Oily and soggy. Unless this was a one off experience I don't see how anyone can enjoy this chicken if you've had truly great fried chicken before. I would head over to olive chicken or even Popeye's any day over this. Oh well."}
{"text":"This was NOT my meal but I tried this beautiful 3 piece meal, every part of it -  fried chicken, fries and coleslaw, not to mention a little fritter that was thrown in. I try to watch what I eat and fried chicken is not my thing but it is M's thing so in we went and he zipped through the line inside this funky take-out chicken place while I waited in the car. Fast service and he said his 3 piece meal cost him $8. Impressive for Calgary standards! This was our first time trying this place out. BETTER than KFC, in our opinion. The chicken was fresh, we got 3 different pieces which is nice. The fries - I noted some people thought they were soggy on some reviews here - wow, we like them that way and they were seasoned perfectly! The fritter was deelish. I could have eaten a lot of those.The coleslaw was good too, and usually I am not a fan.  Overall, just a good meal for those who like fried chicken and deserve a treat now and then! I loved how they wrap each box with care, like a gift! I was asked to rate this a 5 star by M, and I would have to agree. I was trying to focus on my own Vietnamese meal but it was difficult. Man, that chicken skin was sinfully good! We shall return!"}
{"text":"Although I dont eat meat, my friends wanted to stop in to pick up some stuff and I thought I would get some fries.  I loved the kitch of this place. When looking around, it becomes obvious that little has changed here in the many years they have been open.  I guess that is the appeal of a place like this. It is consistent. Good or bad, like it or hate it, it likely hasnt changed much at all.   When you go in there there is a little cue like thing that you line up in, kind of like waiting for a ride at Disney World except instead of its a small world its more like its a grease world after all. The people behind the counter look like they would rather be anywhere at work but they are efficient and \"git er done\". I ordered chips which they put in a fun little box with thier logo on it, but the best part, my favourite part... is that they wrap the box in brown paper and tape it up.  It is kind of like a present... so stupid that I like this the best, but it makes it different, and kinda special.  I also ordered corn fritters, and I have to say that I really liked them, they are huge, doughy and greasy but I loved them. The fries were plentiful, but nothing special. I would go back for the fritters though.  The prices are very reasonable and there is plenty of parking out front."}
{"text":"Yeah, food from Chicken on the Way is not great, but it's cheap and it's good for soaking up excess beer in your stomach."}
{"text":"In KFC if I wanted dark meat, the price is the same, no special ordering that costs extra and whatever mumbo-jumbo is involved in the pricing.  When I ordered @ chicken on the way it costs 5 dollars more for 8 pieces of dark meat versus the combo deal which gave random pieces of meat. In truth I wasn't even that hungry!?  Their corn fritters are good but not a big fan of their gravy, I honestly had to pump a spoon full of pepper to mimic KFC's gravy.  Honestly I get the whole family local business deal. But if I wanted to taste homestyle chicken, I might as well invite myself over to someones house."}
{"text":"Got a hankering for a mediocre piece of chicken at an average price? Stopped in here and grabbed 3 piece chicken with fries and gravy, as well as a few corn fritters. Nothing special about the chicken, just a piece of KFC-like chicken lacking spice and a little overcooked. The corn fritters are a little on the overcooked side but are quite large. The best part of the meal was the gravy which made the entire meal better but not amazing. Its a \"meh, its ok\" in my book."}
{"text":"The Kensington kings of fried chicken for over 50 years!  Driving home hungry, I see the bright yellow sign on the corner of 14th St and Kensington proudly displaying in crooked lettering \"5 pce Hungry Man Dinner $10!\" Try as I might, I couldn't find a suitable argument to counter the suggestion. Ok Chicken on the Way, you win this round, it's gonna be a stuff my face with fried chicken kind of evening!  You open to door and the pleasant smell of chicken and deep-fryer hits your nostrils. Next, you suppress your inner child's desire to make yellow and red box-forts out of the massive walls of to-go boxes surrounding the counter. The person at the till asks you what you would like and if your answer is \"Chicken\", ooooh boy! You are in luck!   The menu consists of chicken, corn fritters and fries. Just pick the quantity of each that'll satisfy and you're in business! After that, all you gotta do is control your excitement until you get to your final destination,  take that yellow and red box out of  brown paper it's carefully wrapped in and enjoy your delicious meal of deep fried foods spanning a whole rainbow of the brown to beige colour spectrum.  Pro tips: The chicken piece sizes vary a huge amount and can be pretty inconsistant.  The money piece is the chicken breast! Tonight, this thing was a good quarter chicken, it was fantastic. But another piece was a junky little wing that would have been disappointing even by neighbourhood pub wing night standards. Because of this, you don't really get that much more chicken when you go from a 3-piece to a 4 or 5-piece meal.  I've never seen it on any menus, but they have containers of honey for 25 cents. Get one to dip you corn fritters in! Do it! It brings these delectable little dough balls right to life!  I never really cared for them before, but I found the honey, and I'm now a fan of the fritter!  I saw a sign saying they now have chicken strips for $1.75. I haven't tried them yet. Let me know how they go!"}
{"text":"We love chicken on the way. The chicken is piping hot, very fresh and very very juicy. The fries are amazing. The fritters a re unique and good. The fish is same as the chicken, out of this world. Only drawback is its pretty greasy, but of course it's deep fried, battered food so what do you expect? Once in a while, especially after a long bike ride or hike, it's not a game changer, and you won't regret the indulgence!"}
{"text":"I little expensive for the quality but great taste. The fries are okey. Crunchy and delicious."}
{"text":"Best chicken next to Swiss Chalet. Always get the hungry man, their corn fritters are reaalllllyyy good. Quick and Fast. Would love some right now."}
{"text":"Fried chicken that's delicious, it's in a small hole in the wall kinda good but they have the goods. If you want a sinfully delicious treat check it out."}
{"text":"My dad tells me stories of COTW from when he was a little boy and how he's get commissioned to get food for a neighbor and was given a piece of chicken as payment on a semi-regular basis.  As a firm believe that things were better in the old days,  he still loves Chicken-on-the-way because it's the same place 50+ years later.  That being said it was  a bit of a fixture in my childhood too because it was a huge treat for my dad to go there.    As a vegetarian,  I don't eat much here but I do love corn fritters and honey and they do satisfy the drunken requirement for some grease while pleasing my meat eating friends that want their fish or chicken.  In line,  you'll talk to people that have come from out of town for the chicken and I believe it.   The fries aren't my thing but you can see them hand cutting them and hand rolling the fritters like they have for so many years.    The food is not expensive,  completely diet busting as one my expect but it's come a good comfort factor to it."}
{"text":"Always great chicken, can't understand why some people complain, its a real chicken place not that garbage you get at KFC, so what if its not covered in formica and stainless steel, its one of the most consistently good chicken restaurants in Calgary for over 50 years a happy customer for over 40 years"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the food I got here. Airdrie location got me switched in to the flavor, but here the oil was old, so the fried cornbread was awful and I just tossed the chicken and had a few fries before grabbing a burger at a drive through.   Pretty bad when food tastes that terrible when you're hungry."}
{"text":"I love COTW!  Have gone there for yrs.  The orig. location in Kensington is a few mins. from my apt. so I drop in frequently.  And I've even been known to call (2x) to compliment them on great juicy non-greasy delectable chicken. But today...it was different. I bought the snack pack and when I got home, the chicken was barely luke warm and kinda dry and hard, like maybe it was made a few hrs. earlier.  And the corn fritter was so tough and hard, I couldn't eat it.  COTW, please, please..take the time to keep your products up to the excellent reputation you've established here in Calgary for so many yrs. I'll be back, but will request my order be prepared fresh. I'm happy to wait.  And, sorry to say, as much as I'd love to give COTW 5+ stars, I just can't...not after today's misadventure."}
{"text":"i love fried chicken, and i love COTW. It's a dirty, late night secret kinda place- like i want to order some chicken and eat it alone in the dark so I don't have to share, or be embarrassed that I ate like, half a chicken just now...  It is crispy, and always juicy inside (not greasy, juicy and moist!) The pieces are bigger than other chains- especially the breast which is actually a whole chicken breast. The seasoning, as far as I can tell, is just a lot of salt. I'm ok with that, because seriously the skin is so crispy and delicious... man I want some now...  I like that the owner seems to hate his life, but still shows up to dunk endless birds into the  grease. I see they have opened up 2 other locations, and that makes me happy too. It's a family run place since it opened, which I also like to support.  The only downside is eating way too much and feeling like a salt mummy the next day, but worth it every time!"}
{"text":"Listen to the reviews:  Get the corn fritters. Delicious. Fresh and hot and crispy on the outside.   And beware of the bland chicken. It's really bland. Even though the crust is good and the chicken is totally fresh and hot. Might want to go home and open up a few bottles of dipping sauces!   Service is excellent. Super duper friendly staff, super helpful too.   The chicken really isn't my style. I'm more a PopEyes kinda gal. But hey, to each their own."}
{"text":"I love Chicken On The Way and upon frequently driving my better half from my home in Mission to Kincora it literally is just that.  I am surprised at comments made by other yelpers because I find the chicken here grease free, in fact it tastes fresh and tender and crispy. Not cholesterol free! I ain't no fool! But I certainly don't have to use half a tree in serviettes to wipe the grease like when I eat at KFC's.    But this review is not complete unless I mention the crème de la crème ...the corn fritters. Spoken with a Brooklyn accent \"They melt in your mouth like butta\".  Wow, talk about return visits just for these little critters, the critter fritters.   Parking access is so convenient too that I find my stomach seems to be quite content beforehand and then growling like a mad woman in hunger when I pass the Calgary landmark.  I may have angered local Calgarians with my last minute turning signal.  If I that was you, I apologise now,  I am a slave to my tummy.  Did I just miss that turn off?  No problem, I will just pick some up whilst returning home, after all it is CHICKEN ON THE WAY!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Chicken On The Way after a late night driving around and looking for something to fill our bellies. I couldn't believe how busy it was. By the time we got home, the fries were kinda soggy and I wasn't amazed. The chicken was hot, tasty, and CRISPY (which I love), but it lacked seasoning and to be honest I found it a little bland. As much as it kills me to say it, I still prefer KFC. Sometimes I just want to hate myself for eating little, delicious chemical chickens. The corn fritters were BOMB though! My boyfriend and I both ate around 10 or so, give or take. I might come back if I'm drunk and want chicken."}
{"text":"Wow! Thats all i can say about chicken-on-the-run Kensington location. They really have got fried chicken down to a science at this place! I come here at least 4 times a week, which isn't that great for my adult onset  acne but WHO CARES when the food is this good!  To start off i usually get an 8 piece dark meat with 10 corn fritters. This may seem like a lot, but i like to save some leftovers for home, which i stick into the freezer for a few hours and turn into chicken popsicles (my own invention). The kids love to eat my chickensicles on a hot summers day. Now the fried chicken here is absolutely exquisite, i have tried a couple of other chicken on the ways and they just werent quite as good as the kensington location. I spoke to an employee about this and he told me it was because the fryers are never completely cleaned out, only drained and refilled on occasion to keep the wonderful seasoning flavor of many decades of chicken frying. Tremendous!  Now the fritters are something else. I know one would think that a side item like fritters should never outdo the bird itself, but these things are incredibly addictive! I used to have quite the sizeable fentanyl addiction, im not proud of it, but i managed to quit after 3 stints in rehab, and i dont mind saying that these fritters are even more addictive than that horrible opiate that stole a few years of my life away. These are to die for.  Overall this is one of my favorite places to have a meal at in this city, and if you are a fan of good old fashioned fried chicken then you gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"The perfect place to grab a snack to share for a trip to Riley park. Don't forget corn fritters and honey!  Reminds me of being a kid again!"}
{"text":"Worst food poisoning I have ever had. Apathetic bitch of a so called manager could nt bother to apologize. I hope it burns down..."}
{"text":"I'll always have a soft spot for Chicken on the way. Not the best chicken in the city but the price, the amount of food, and the corn fritter can't be beat. The kensignton location is a calgary institution!"}
{"text":"I was in the Kensington neighbourhood and came by based on the several raving reviews.  I ordered the snack pack which comes with 2 pieces of fried chicken, a side (I chose fries) and a corn critter.  This could by far be the worst fried chicken I've ever tasted.  Even the fries and corn fritter were bad.  Everything was greasy and soggy with strong reused oil taste.  Not sure if it's a one off but I'm sure I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Chicken on the way is located in the corner of Kensington Road NW, you really can't miss it!!  I must admit, I have these weird cravings.  I've been craving some crispy greasy chicken alot lately and I've driven past Chicken on the way multiple times but when I first mentioned Chicken on the way to Spence, his response was \"Yuck!\"  So after a while I kept avoiding it and avoiding it, not thinking anything of it.    So after 4 years of living in Calgary, I FINALLY gave Chicken on the way a try.  I went against Spence's \"Yuck\" and tried it one night after a yoga class at Beyond yoga.  It wasn't far but I did go out OUT OF THE WAY to try Chicken on the way! (haha)  It was about 9:45PM and I was the only one in the parking lot.  When I walked in, I was winded by the smell of greasy goodness.  After reading other reviews, I went with the 2 piece chicken with fries and a corn frit to go.  It was ready RIGHT AWAY!! I paid $6.50 and walked right out ... it was pretty fast!  I set the bag on my passenger seat, and started driving.  As I drove, I really couldn't help myself, so I reached over AT A RED LIGHT (no distracted driver for me :P) and grabbed some fries. MMMM MMMM, nice hot crispy fries with skin on them and just enough salt!  When I got home, I dug into the bag, took the small yellow box out and went in for the chicken. MMM AHHH, so delicious!!  The skin on the chicken was extra crispy..just the way I like it, the meat was juicy, the fries were still nice and hot, and the corn frit was tasty!  The corn frit was a little dry, but still hot with a slight crisp.  I took a bite and you can see pieces of corn inside.  It was good, but nothing to rave about though.  I'm sure the freshest ones are the best.  The chicken and fries were the main event!  I'd say, it's worth going out of your way to stop at chicken on the way!! :)"}
{"text":"Gross... the food is slimy and greasy and there was a man smoking crack cocaine outside while drinking crown royal. Overall not a amazing experience."}
{"text":"Finding put about this place is probably the best thing to come out of a lousy date in awhile. I was told they had the best fried chicken in town, and although I haven't tried any other in town, it was a very good. Just enough crunch to meat ratio, and without all the traditional fast food grease.  I ordered one chicken breast, two chicken strips,  and three corn fritters for only $8.85 post tax...way too much food for a growing girl but worth it. The chicken breast was moist, the chicken strips are amazing (highly recommend! ), and the fritters are better than most (bigger than golf ball btw).  FYI If you are interested in the strips, they can be substituted for pieces in the meal deals."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I ever had. I've been looking for a replacement ever since moving away and no one has ever been even remotely close. Be prepared for the lines!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where you wonder when the last time they changed the oil.  This place has been around before KFC came to Calgary and will probably still be there after KFC is long gone.  This is great drunk food!"}
{"text":"A great spot for fried chicken, this place had constant traffic inside the small stand up order line which can only mean delicious food. Excited I ordered the bonus , 3 prices, fritters and gravy for $8.50.  This place smelt good and the food was heart stopping."}
{"text":"I f*cking love this place.  But warning!  This isn't for the healthy eater. Let me tell you why I love COTW alphabetically 1)  Corn Fritters - My sweet baby jesus, don't get just one, you'll regret it. 2) French fries - they're brown, they're NOT mushy, they're spectacular 3) Fried chicken - that skin tho 4) GRAVY - it's lighter, it's a chicken gravy, but it GOES ON EVERYTHING.  Normally my husband and I will only have COTW when someone dies or we've had like the WORST week, because it's not great for you.  But it's so great.  How is this possible?  Service is fast, and the pricing is actually pretty amazing.  They have a deal called the HUNGRYMAN and it's $11 for 5 pieces of chicken, fries and fritters.  Their family meal is two sides, 12 pieces of chicken and a MONSTER fries for 30$.  So obviously we ordered the latter cause we whales.  whether you order from kensington or from McKenzie Towne, each is delicious.  I remember COTW in Mac Towne was just outside my gym and I used to leave the gym smelling it and watching to die.  So I just stopped going to the gym, problem solved.  Anyways, good day or bad day, your day will be better with chicken on the way, so go get sum!"}
{"text":"It makes me sad when Calgarians don't recognize the gift they have in a classic establishment like Chicken on the Way.  Being a \"transplant\" to this city myself, I remain impressed by Chicken on the Way's classic fried fare.  The chicken is juicy and moist, while the skin is pleasantly crispy and flavourful. The fries are decent and the Corn Fritters are absolutely to die for.  No joke.  If I was thinking about my \"last request\" meal options, I would strongly consider a side of fritters.  As tried and true Calgary institutions go, forget Peter's ... Chicken on the Way is the real deal and they got the track record to prove it. Over 50 years in the running, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My friend totally got me hooked on Chicken On The Way. I'm not actually a huge fan of their chicken; I think the flavour is just okay, but nothing special. Other people must really like it though, because there is a huge lineup every time I come here.   What keeps me stopping by here every time I visit Calgary is their corn fritters. These are so delicious. They are deep fried and have just a hint of sweetness. They taste great by themselves, but even better dipped in their delicious gravy. They are really cheap too. I think last time we got nine of them, and I know it cost under five bucks. This is not healthy at all, but as a treat, it's more than satisfying.   Last time I was here, I noticed a giant chicken statue outside. I think it's rather new, because I am not sure how I could have missed that before. Anyways, the next day it snowed, and when we drove by, the chicken was bright pink!! It changes colour with temperature. How cool is that?"}
