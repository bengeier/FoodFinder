{"text":"Overpriced absolutely middle of the road pizza, something of a let down.

The crust is pretty insubstantial, sauce is decent, toppings are okay. There's nothing really wrong with their pizza, other than the crust, but it's not particularly great either. 

The staff were very friendly and there are no problems on the service end . 

At $20+ for  a 12 inch there are a lot of far better options for pizza or even just eating out."}
{"text":"Pizza Alert,Pizza Alert!! This is Calgary's Best Pizza and we know pizza...who am i? I am Bonnie's fiance and we love pizza and we have finally found the Best Pizza in Calgary. As you have read in Bonnie's post everything was perfect this is the only Pizza Calgary should have..why you ask...all the other pizza places should be ashamed of themselves and i mean all of them they all over processed and over rated. Bros Dough has got it all right that is why they are the all the ingredients that make them the best is it is all 100% fresh. You an taste from your first bite until your very last ( My Mouth is Watering just think about there Pizza) There is only one other Pizza establishment that is just as good and they are in another Province and that Province is British Columbia and the name of that Pizza Place is Mile High Pizza and they are located in the city of Kamloops B.C. This is the best Pizza in British Columbia but now Calgary can now say they have the BEST PIZZA IN CALGARY BROS DOUGH. Forget Pizza 73,Domino's, Lil' Caesars, Panago, Pizza Hut,Boston Pizza, Avatar,Bob's.Papa Johns\"s,UNA, Cibo etc.etc.etc.. All these places are over rated and over processed. You want the Best it is here Calgary and it is Bros Dough one last thing the people that own this establishment are Smart and great people who know how to make pizza and make you want more and i almost forgot no Shawarma's. So to all Calgarian's i dare you to try and compare and enjoy the fact you have a Pizza to be proud of you will not be disappointed. As you can see we have tried a lot of Pizza in Calgary and how did we come upon this place...We were driving by and the name caught my eye.

Nuff Said."}
{"text":"It seems to be a family run little business. 
Therefore the service is not very fast, but the pizza is way much better than what you can find in big chains.
It has a feeling of ordering pizza from an small, independent, family-owned neighborhood pizzeria.

Note: It's a TAKE OUT only place."}
{"text":"I lived 1 block away from this place for 4 months and it was only on my last night in the city did I indulge in Bros Dough. It was a very convenient location (obviously it was beside my house) and they offered a 15% discount if you picked up your order. The staff were friendly and the pizzas were large, everything that should add up to a great pizza eating experience.  Unfortunately the pizza had a lacklustre of flavour and the cheese just wasn't doing it for me. I so wanted to like this place, it seemed like it could be pretty trendy. Sigh, oh well."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this new pizza place as I was told about how great it was.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  

The location itself is quite awkward to get to if you are driving as there is no parking lot.  To confuse you even more, they offer 15% off the price for take out.  I live quite close to the place but was baffled to find out that it would cost an additional delivery charge as we were just outside of their delivery area.  

I called to place the order and was told that 20-30 minutes would be sufficient.  I arrived a bit earlier as I wanted to check the place out.  I was greeted by a nice Greek lady who told me the order wasn't ready yet.  The menu isn't quite large and the prices are quite high for pizza.  I ordered the ham and pineapple.  I actually ended up waiting about 40 minutes - thankfully the Oscars Red Carpet was on to keep me occupied.

I was reviewing the menu and I was surprised that the hours on Saturday went until 4AM!  Also surprised to see their housemade tzatiki for $4.00.  I didn't order it though.

When we got home, the pizza didn't look overly appealing.  The toppings also came off the pizza as we pulled the slices apart.  The crust was ok.  It wasn't the best crust that I had and was quite disappointed.  

I think for the price of the pizza as well as the quality, there's definitely way better places out there.  I think if I lived upstairs in the condos, it would be very convenient.  Also good to know they are open quite late for those late night weekends."}
